<text>Body Modification Ezine (BME) is an online magazine devoted to body modification, noted for its coverage of the extreme and fringes of body modification and erotic body play.

== History and content ==
&quot;BME&quot; was started as a web site hosted at Internex Online on December 6, 1994, by Shannon Larratt and was the first body modification website.

BME was expanded in 2000 by the addition of &quot;IAM.BMEzine&quot;, an online community, which hosts blogs specifically for members of the body-modification community.

In late 2005, BME added both a video sister site, &quot;BMEvideo&quot; and a body modification blog, &quot;Modblog.BMEzine.com&quot;.

The site often publishes hoax articles each year on April Fools&#x27; Day.

Both Shannon and Rachel Larratt have cameo appearances in the Kevin Smith feature &quot;Clerks II&quot;.

On May 14, 2008, Shannon Larratt posted onto ModBlog that he would no longer be an employee of BME.

On March 15, 2013, it was announced that Shannon Larratt had died.

==BME BBQs==
Patrons of the BME website and its IAM community have often gathered for barbecues where they can meet with one another. Historically, the largest of these BBQs, known as BMEFest, were held in or around Toronto, Ontario and generally on Canada Day with hundreds of participants. The festivities of BMEFest almost always include suspensions, fireworks, grilled food both vegan and otherwise, and there is usually a commemorative T-shirt for each event. It is generally free to attend but it is encouraged to sign up ahead of time and may be exclusive to a private group.

== Censorship ==
The BME site is blocked by many Internet filtering services intended to protect children (and workplaces), for reasons such as nudity, torture, and other adult content. It was banned by Germany&#x27;s Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien in 1999 as a &quot;danger to the youth&quot; because BME did not include age verification or an entrance page warning users of potential adult content. In December 2005, the German agency forced Google to remove the site from search results returned by www.google.de.

Shannon Larratt writes in Zentastic.com:
: When Germany came after BME for &quot;endangering the youth&quot; and demanded that I make changes to the site to comply with German law, my response was to simply not visit Germany again (and I&#x27;m a German citizen). When the US started to pressure us, we moved all of our servers and presence out of the country and backed off on plans to live in the US. No changes were ever made to the site, and no images were ever removed — if anything, the pressure made me push those areas even more.

<text>The Farm () is a historic farmhouse and the official residence of the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada. It is located in Gatineau Park in the community of Kingsmere, Quebec, Canada, near the country&#x27;s capital, Ottawa. The Farm has been managed and maintained by the National Capital Commission since 1986. In addition to the Farm, the Speaker of the House of Commons is also provided a two-room apartment in Centre Block on Parliament Hill. The residence and its of grounds are not open to the public.

==History==

The residence was originally part of a farmstead built by settler Henry Fleury in the mid-19th century. William Lyon Mackenzie King, the 10th Prime Minister of Canada, privately purchased the farmstead in 1927 to incorporate it into his country estate at Kingsmere Lake. King had the house renovated in 1935 to serve as a summer home, building two new wings as well as adding heating and indoor plumbing systems.

Upon his retirement from politics King spent more time at the Farm and it was where he died on July 22, 1950. In his will he bequeathed his entire country estate &quot;to the government and people of Canada&quot; and expressed a desire for the residence to be used by future prime ministers. The grounds of the Mackenzie King Estate were absorbed into Gatineau Park, however 24 Sussex Drive had already been designated the official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada so the Farm was instead designated as the residence for the Speaker of the House of Commons in 1955.

<text>Dr. Alexander Tollmann (27 June 1928 – 8 August 2007) was an Austrian professor of geology.
He was born in Vienna. He had been professor at the Geologischen Institut of the University of Vienna since 1969. He was a political activist working to free Austria from nuclear energy and a founder of the Austrian Green Party (&quot;Vereinten Grünen Österreichs&quot; or VGÖ).

In 1993, with his wife, paleontologist Edith Kristan-Tollmann, he published a monograph, &quot;Und die Sintflut gab es doch. Vom Mythos zur historischen Wahrheit&quot;, which claimed that Noah&#x27;s flood was the consequence of a bolide impact about 9500 years ago, and supported the claim through geology (impact craters, iridium, shatter cones, stress lamination of minerals, radiocarbon dating, dendrochronology, a peak of acid in the Greenland ice) and legends and folk traditions. See Tollmann&#x27;s hypothetical bolide.

Later in his life, he turned to esoteric fields and published obscure hypotheses for which he was strongly criticized by the scientific community. In 1998 the husband-and-wife team (posthumously; his wife had died in 1995) published &quot;Das Weltenjahr geht zur Neige: Mythos und Wahrheit der Prophezeiungen&quot;. The book was on the Austrian bestseller list for weeks. In August 1999, he predicted a world-wide catastrophe by studying the predictions of Nostradamus, that he awaited in his bunker in Lower Austria. In December 2003, Tollmann published &quot;Und die Wahrheit siegt schließlich doch&quot; (&quot;And the truth finally prevails&quot;).

<text>The Mad Capsule Markets (originally known as The Mad Capsule Market&#x27;s and Berrie) were a Japanese band that formed in 1985 and were active until 2006. The band became known for their experimental style, which melded various kinds of electronic music and punk rock.

== Biography ==
=== Berrie (1985–1990) ===
In 1985, while in high school, vocalist and songwriter Hiroshi Kyono and guitarist Minoru Kojima formed the punk band Berrie. One year later, the duo were joined by bassist Takeshi Ueda and drummer &quot;Seto&quot;, at which point the quartet began performing at concerts and entering Battle of the Bands competitions. The band recorded a three-song demo tape entitled &quot;Poison Revolution&quot;, which they distributed themselves. (Two of these three songs were later re-released on the &quot;Speak!!!&quot; album.) Their popularity in the Japanese underground music scene steadily grew and in 1990 this success earned them a place as the opening act for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. However, within months of the performance, drummer &quot;Seto&quot; left the band, and was replaced by Tokyo resident Motokatsu Miyagami. In April 1990, Berrie changed its name to The Mad Capsule Market&#x27;s, purportedly a term for distributors of Betaphenethylamine, a fictional drug from the cyberpunk novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;.

=== Early years (1990–1996) ===
In August 1990, the new band released their first single, &quot;Government Wall&quot;, a re-recording of the Berrie song. In October, they released their debut album, &quot;Humanity&quot;, which also featured a number of Berrie songs and retained their punk sound. After the album&#x27;s release, original guitarist Minoru Kojima left the band, and was replaced by former roadie Ai Ishigaki. The following year, The Mad Capsule Markets signed to major record label Victor Entertainment and recorded their second album, &quot;P.O.P&quot;. A faster and harder album than their first, it was heavily censored, provoking outrage from the band members. Their earlier lyrical content, with the lyrics, written mostly by bassist Takeshi Ueda, had Marxist/working-class influences, with lyrical themes becoming more and more political with later releases. From 1990 their sound was mainly punk influenced but quickly began to incorporate different influences in their music by the likes of Killing Joke, Aburadako, The Stalin and Yellow Magic Orchestra.

From 1992 onwards the band began to experiment with their sound, introducing various sampling machines and New Wave sounds. In 1992 they recorded the EP &quot;Capsule Soup&quot; and their third album &quot;Speak!!!!&quot;. In 1993, their fourth album &quot;Mix-ism&quot; leaned more towards ska, and in 1994 their fifth album &quot;Park&quot; demonstrated a slower and more melodic style. This was also the first album to be released overseas (in the United States, although almost two years after its Japanese release).

Recorded and produced in the US, their 1996 album &quot;4 Plugs&quot; saw a musical shift towards metal. Although the band retained its style of rock with electronic influences, the music was darker and heavier. Vocalist Kyono also altered his singing style and began rapping in English occasionally. This marked the beginning of the major stylistic change that would be demonstrated on subsequent recordings. Takashi Fujita joined the band as an additional live guitarist for the subsequent tour.

Later that year, the band released The Mad Capsule Market&#x27;s, a greatest hits compilation containing re-recorded songs from their career up to that point. Following its release, guitarist Ai Ishigaki left the band. Instead of recruiting an official replacement guitarist, the band opted to continue as a trio, with guitar being performed by support guitarist &quot;TORUxxx&quot;.

=== Stylistic change and international recognition (1997–2005) ===
Perhaps boosted by the change in guitarist, The Mad Capsule Markets&#x27; sound became heavier still. In 1997 they released their second international album and eighth overall, &quot;Digidogheadlock&quot;. A strong progression from &quot;4 Plugs&quot;, electronica came to the forefront and the music had a great deal in common with industrial metal.

Also in 1997, the band performed at the American music festival South by Southwest as part of the Japan Nite event.

In 1999 the band released their most internationally recognized album to date. &quot;Osc-Dis (Oscillator in Distortion)&quot; was a more poppy or melodic take on the sound of &quot;Digidogheadlock&quot;. It was released worldwide in 2001, driven by the hugely popular single &quot;Pulse&quot;, which featured on the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;. The song and the album became the group&#x27;s most well known outside Japan. At this time the band also introduced their robotic &quot;mascots&quot; the White Crusher and Black Cyborn.

The Mad Capsule Markets&#x27; tenth album, &quot;010&quot;, was released in 2001 and demonstrated all the styles that they had explored previously, with a stronger emphasis on electronica. This produced a record which sounded more diverse than those before it. In 2002 the band also released a live album entitled &quot;020120&quot;, after the date of the performance.

In 2004 the band produced their most recent studio album, &quot;Cistm Konfliqt...&quot; (pronounced &quot;System Conflict&quot;). The album was a return to the heaviness of &quot;Digidogheadlock&quot;, but this heaviness was filtered through the electronic experimentation of the previous two albums, maintaining a strong link with digital hardcore. The UK release of &quot;Cistm Konfliqt...&quot; in 2005 saw the band&#x27;s popularity there grow, with rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; inviting them to play numerous concerts. Japanese mixed martial arts fighter Takanori Gomi uses the track &quot;Scary&quot; for his entrance theme.

In 2005, The Mad Capsule Markets broke from longtime record label Victor/Invitation and signed to Sony Music Japan. They released two greatest hits compilations of songs spanning their entire career, these were entitled &quot;1990–1996&quot; and &quot;1997–2004&quot;.

On April 5 the band announced that they were taking an &#x27;extended break&#x27; from making music under the Mad Capsule Markets&#x27; name and instead work on separate projects. They posted this on the official Japanese site:

&quot;Thank you so much for big support for us. This time, after our discuss with 3 guys from the band, we decide to take an extended break as the band. We can&#x27;t decide when we can re-start again as the band, at this point. Each from the band plans to work as individual artist/projects, please keep supporting us from now on. thank you.&quot;

<text>In professional wrestling slang, a job is a losing performance in a wrestling match. It is derived from &quot;doing one&#x27;s job,” a euphemism to hide kayfabe-related information. When a wrestler is booked to lose a match, it is described as &quot;a job&quot;. The act itself is jobbing, whereas the act of booking (rather than being booked) to job is called jobbing out. To lose a match fairly (meaning without any kayfabe rules being broken) is to job cleanly. Wrestlers who routinely (or exclusively) lose matches are known as jobbers or &quot;dummy wrestlers&quot;. A wrestler skilled at enhancing the matches they lose, as opposed to a jobber, is called a carpenter. In the post-kayfabe era the term has taken on a negative connotation, leading to the use of the neutral term &quot;enhancement talent&quot;.

==Definition==
A job presented as being the result of an extremely close, entertaining match, or underhanded tactics on the part of an opponent, will not necessarily tarnish a wrestler&#x27;s reputation, especially if the situation is presented as one in which the wrestler deserved to win but was cheated. At other times a high-profile loss, particularly one which makes the wrestler in question look weak, foolish, or otherwise damages their reputation, might signify certain behind-the-scenes events that have real-life implications on a wrestler. Such a job may mark the end of a push, a departure from the company, or a loss of faith in the wrestler as a marketable commodity. As a result, it may also mark a downward slide in a wrestler&#x27;s career. This is especially the case when the wrestler is beaten very easily, or squashed.

Sometimes, jobbing is presented to a wrestler because of the problems and bad working relationship that the wrestler and the owner of the promotion have. At other times, it is a requirement of a wrestler&#x27;s on-the-job training, learning how to perform in front of a live audience while helping make the more established wrestlers look credible.

World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has referred to jobbers as &quot;lovable&quot;, &quot;adorable&quot; &quot;losers&quot;. Sometimes they euphemistically use the term &quot;local competitor&quot;.

==Historic usage==
Jobber is a professional wrestling term used to describe a wrestler who is routinely defeated by main eventers, mid-carders, or low-carders. Most promoters do not use the term because of the negative connotation. Jobbers have been used since the 1950s, and they were popular in promotions of the United States and Canada around this time.

World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) made greatest use of full-time jobbers during their syndicated television shows in the 1980s and early 1990s, &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; and &quot;All-Star Wrestling&quot;. Barry Horowitz and Steve Lombardi were the wrestlers most prominently identified with this role; other wrestlers who performed mainly as jobbers during this period included &quot;Leaping&quot; Lanny Poffo, Brady Boone, Tiger Chung Lee, Barry O, Reno Riggins, Duane Gill, Barry Hardy, Mick Foley, Scott Casey, Dangerous Danny Davis (also wrestling as Mr. X), The Shadows (Randy Colley and Jose Luis Rivera), Los Conquistadores (Jose Luis Rivera and José Estrada Sr.), &quot;Iron&quot; Mike Sharpe, Von Krus, S. D. Jones, George South, Dusty Wolfe, Mario Mancini, Tim Horner, Sonny Rogers, Brian Costello, Red Tyler, and Tom &quot;Rocky&quot; Stone. Many of these wrestlers also did work matches against each other at larger arena cards at venues such as Madison Square Garden and were usually more competitive against their opponents, with several of these wrestlers gaining victories. In some cases, a number of these wrestlers had main-event matches at some point (such as Sharpe receiving matches against then-WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund or Danny Davis working in six-man tag-team matches with The Hart Foundation, usually against Tito Santana and the British Bulldogs (during the &quot;dishonest referee&quot; angle)) before being pushed toward the bottom of the roster&#x27;s hierarchy; others, such as Mick Foley, would later become main-event wrestlers. Some were given gimmicks of their own, such as Poffo (a poet laureate as a face and as a snobbish intellectual, known as &quot;The Genius&quot;, who also read poems as a heel) and Lombardi (&quot;The Brooklyn Brawler&quot;, a smug, tough-talking brawler).

World Championship Wrestling (WCW), just like the WWE, made huge use of jobbers during the late 1980s and 1990s. Jobbers like Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker, Dale Veasey, George South, Bobby Walker, Joe Gomez, The Gambler, The Roadblock and Trent Knight lost the majority of their matches. However, they usually scored clean victories against other pure jobbers. Wrestlers who worked as jobbers for WWE were also employed as jobbers in WCW during this period.

The American Wrestling Association (AWA) also made moderate use of jobbers in their shows. In independent promotions jobbers rarely appear, but when they do, it is mostly in squash matches.

A jobber may not necessarily lose, only make the superstar look powerful—or at least make another wrestler interfering with the match to look more powerful. One example is Jimmy Jacobs: employed by WWE as a jobber for a time, Jacobs wrestled Eddie Guerrero during the latter&#x27;s last heel run. Though Jacobs was squashed, he actually won by disqualification when Guerrero beat him with a chair. Another example of a jobber winning was when &quot;The Kid&quot; suddenly won an upset over Razor Ramon on the May 17, 1993, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. He then renamed himself the &quot;1-2-3 Kid&quot;. This win (and the Kid) were worked into Ramon&#x27;s feud with Ted DiBiase, with DiBiase taunting Ramon repeatedly over losing to a nobody until he too was pinned by the Kid. On the September 20, 1993, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, I.R.S. was pinned with a rollup by P.J. Walker thanks to Ramon&#x27;s interference.

Jobbers can also get recognition on social media after appearing on a major promotion, giving them exposure they wouldn&#x27;t receive otherwise. While being interviewed by Byron Saxton before his match against Braun Strowman in 2016, independent wrestler Johnny Knockout said he wanted to wrestle Strowman because &quot;he likes big, sweaty men&quot;. The unexpected response led to Knockout eventually trending on Twitter ahead of other events on that night&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot;.

Heels and some faces used to abuse and humiliate jobbers during or after a match: Jake Roberts would allow his pet snake slither over his opponents once he pinned them; Brutus Beefcake would cut their hair off (on those sporting long hair or a mullet); Big Boss Man would cuff them to the ropes and beat them with a baton; Ted DiBiase would put them under with the Million Dollar Dream and then stuff a hundred-dollar bill in their mouths; Lex Luger, under his &quot;Narcissist&quot; gimmick, would make them stand up by holding them by the hair and make them look at themselves in a mirror; the Islanders would chew some fruit (usually pineapple) and then spit it over their chests, and so on. 

Some jobbers, such as Barry Horowitz, Iron Mike Sharpe, the Brooklyn Brawler or the Mulkey Brothers grew to become household names to fans. Others, such as Trent Knight, Cougar Jay, Reno Riggins, Tommy Angel, Bob Emory, Ricky Nelson, Curtis Thompson, Kenny Kendall, or Eddie Jackie, were expected by fans to be squashed and even humiliated during or after a match. For example, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts got Bob Emory&#x27;s and Trent Knight&#x27;s heads inside the sack where he kept his python snake; Dick Murdoch smashed the aforementioned Emory against a podium and then hit him with a piece of wood, Kenny Kendall got hogtied twice by Bunkhouse Buck at the end of a match, Reno Riggins was made to put a woman&#x27;s dress on.

==Jobbers==
A slightly higher position is &quot;jobber to the stars&quot; (also known as a &quot;glorified jobber&quot;), a wrestler who defeats pure jobbers and mid-carders but consistently loses to top-level or up-and-coming stars. This happens after a main-eventer or mid-carder loses their status and is demoted to this lower level. This often happens to popular faces and sometimes heels towards the end of their careers. Many of these jobbers to the stars are heels who routinely beat up on face jobbers so as to build up a reputation of being reasonably capable competitors (which makes the stars all the more impressive when they in turn defeat them easily) as well as to earn the contempt of the audience who enjoy seeing them finally get their comeuppance when they take on the tougher wrestlers. Heels can also be jobbers, such as Steve Lombardi during the 1980s and early 1990s. In the 1980s, Lombardi teamed with Barry Horowitz, to form a heel team. However, Lombardi and Horowitz ended up losing most of their matches in the WWE. In addition, Triple H was given the role of &quot;jobbing to the stars&quot; by WWF owner Vince McMahon in the summer of 1996 as punishment for the Madison Square Garden Incident.

On the independent wrestling circuit, including the Mexican independent circuit, the star wrestlers with sufficient name recognition to be a draw would travel with their own jobber. Free from televised exposure, the star could beat the same opponent from town to town. Such a jobber could even be elevated to champion status, entering the ring with an impressive sounding title belt only to have it removed at the end of the match night after night.

There are times, however, when a jobber will prove their skill, determination, and/or loyalty to the promotion and move beyond jobber status. Curt Hennig and Eddie Gilbert, who served as high-level jobbers during their initial WWE runs, later became main-eventers. Billy Kidman initially started out as a jobber in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), before moving up the ranks to become a champion in both the WCW and WWE. Paul Roma, who started as a jobber for the WWE in the 1980s, gained enough popularity in WCW to win that promotion&#x27;s Tag Team Titles with partners such as Paul Orndorff and Arn Anderson, the latter as part of the Four Horsemen; however, in Roma&#x27;s case, he went downhill again some time later. The brothers Hardy Boyz began their careers in WWE as jobbers for a few years, before receiving their first push as legitimate contenders in the tag division.

Sometimes the opposite will occur, as was in the case of &quot;Iron&quot; Mike Sharpe, who started as a normal wrestler in the independent circuit and the WWE and ended up being a heel jobber. Another example is Siva Afi, who was a successful main-eventer/mid-carder in the independent circuit, including challenging Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to a 60-minute time limit draw in front of 20,000 people, ended up being a jobber in the WWF, which eventually led to other local promotions to give him a jobber position. A tag-team known as The Undertakers who did well on the independent circuit became jobbers when they joined the WWF in 1992 and became known as Double Trouble.

Sometimes, jobbing may be used as a gimmick. While in ECW, Al Snow began referring to jobbing on-screen as part of his gimmick. He subsequently formed a stable called The J.O.B. Squad, composed of prominent jobbers. In World Championship Wrestling, the tendency of the Armstrongs (particularly Brad Armstrong) to lose matches was referred to as the &quot;Armstrong curse&quot;. On average, however, Brad Armstrong was more of a jobber to the stars, while his brothers were pure jobbers for the most part, though Brian Armstrong would find the greatest success of the brothers in WWE as the Road Dogg, even poking fun at WCW&#x27;s &#x27;burial&#x27; of the Armstrongs by wearing a t-shirt that said &quot;Look Ma! No Curse!&quot;. In 2003, after he returned from his neck injury, Chris Kanyon did a jobber angle, in which his gimmick was &quot;Who&#x27;s Better Than Kanyon? Nobody&quot;. He ended up jobbing to opponents on &quot;WWE Velocity&quot;. A jobber angle involved Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), whose continual losses during the end of 2008 – including embarrassing losses in which he was pinned by roll-ups from mid-level WWE superstars – cost him the signing bonus he received when he joined WWE.

<text>A flame holder is a component of a jet engine used as an ignitor to help maintain continual combustion. In a scramjet engine the residence time of the fuel is very low and complete penetration of the fuel into the flow will not occur. To avoid these conditions flame holders are used.

All continuous-combustion jet engines require a flame holder. A flame holder creates a low-speed eddy in the engine to prevent the flame from being blown out. The design of the flame holder is an issue of balance between a stable eddy and drag.

The simplest design, often used in amateur projects, is the can-type flame holder, which consists of a can covered in small holes. Much more effective is the H-gutter flame holder, which is shaped like a letter H with a curve facing and opposing the flow of air. Even more effective, however, is the V-gutter flame holder, which is shaped like a V with the point in the direction facing the flow of air. Some studies have suggested that adding a small amount of base bleed to a V-gutter helps reduce drag without reducing effectiveness. The most effective of the flame holders are the step type flame holder and the strut type flame holder.

The first mathematical model of a flame holder was proposed in 1953.

<doc id="580668" wikidata="Q946489" url="?curid=580668" title="Pollard's rho algorithm">
<text>Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm is an algorithm for integer factorization. It was invented by John Pollard in 1975. It uses only a small amount of space, and its expected running time is proportional to the square root of the smallest prime factor of the composite number being factorized.

== Core ideas ==
The algorithm is used to factorize a number formula_1, where formula_2 is a non-trivial factor. A polynomial modulo formula_3, called formula_4 (e.g., formula_5), is used to generate a pseudorandom sequence. It is important to note that formula_4 must be a polynomial. A starting value, say 2, is chosen, and the sequence continues as formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, etc. The sequence is related to another sequence formula_10. Since formula_2 is not known beforehand, this sequence cannot be explicitly computed in the algorithm. Yet in it lies the core idea of the algorithm.

Because the number of possible values for these sequences is finite, both the formula_12 sequence, which is mod formula_3, and formula_10 sequence will eventually repeat, even though these values are unknown. If the sequences were to behave like random numbers, the birthday paradox implies that the number of formula_15 before a repetition occurs would be expected to be formula_16, where formula_17 is the number of possible values. So the sequence formula_10 will likely repeat much earlier than the sequence formula_12. When one has found a formula_20 such that formula_21 but formula_22, the number formula_23 is a multiple of formula_2, so a non-trivial divisor has been found.

Once a sequence has a repeated value, the sequence will cycle, because each value depends only on the one before it. This structure of eventual cycling gives rise to the name &quot;rho algorithm&quot;, owing to similarity to the shape of the Greek letter &quot;ρ&quot; when the values formula_25, formula_26, etc. are represented as nodes in a directed graph.

This is detected by Floyd&#x27;s cycle-finding algorithm: two nodes formula_27 and formula_28 (i.e., formula_29 and formula_30) are kept. In each step, one moves to the next node in the sequence and the other moves forward by two nodes. After that, it is checked whether formula_31. If it is not 1, then this implies that there is a repetition in the formula_10 sequence (i.e. formula_33. This works because if the formula_34 is the same as formula_35, the difference between formula_29 and formula_30 is necessarily a multiple of formula_2. Although this always happens eventually, the resulting greatest common divisor (GCD) is a divisor of formula_3 other than 1. This may be formula_3 itself, since the two sequences might repeat at the same time. In this (uncommon) case the algorithm fails, and can be repeated with a different parameter.

== Algorithm ==
The algorithm takes as its inputs , the integer to be factored; and , a polynomial in computed modulo . In the original algorithm, formula_41, but nowadays it is more common to use formula_5. The output is either a non-trivial factor of , or failure. 

It performs the following steps:

Pseudocode for Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm
 x ← 2 // starting value
 y ← x
 d ← 1
 while d = 1:
 x ← g(x)
 y ← g(g(y))
 d ← gcd(|x - y|, n)
 if d = n: 
 return failure
 else:
 return d

Here and corresponds to and in the previous section. Note that this algorithm may fail to find a nontrivial factor even when is composite. In that case, the method can be tried again, using a starting value of &quot;x&quot; other than 2 (formula_43) or a different , formula_44, with formula_45.

== Example factorization ==
Let formula_46 and formula_47.

Now 97 is a non-trivial factor of 8051. Starting values other than may give the cofactor (83) instead of 97. One extra iteration is shown above to make it clear that moves twice as fast as . Note that even after a repetition, the GCD can return to 1.

== Variants ==
In 1980, Richard Brent published a faster variant of the rho algorithm. He used the same core ideas as Pollard but a different method of cycle detection, replacing Floyd&#x27;s cycle-finding algorithm with the related Brent&#x27;s cycle finding method. CLRS gives a heuristic analysis and failure conditions (the trivial divisor formula_3 is found).

A further improvement was made by Pollard and Brent. They observed that if formula_49, then also formula_50 for any positive integer . In particular, instead of computing formula_51 at every step, it suffices to define as the product of 100 consecutive formula_52 terms modulo , and then compute a single formula_53. A major speed up results as 100 steps are replaced with 99 multiplications modulo and a single . Occasionally it may cause the algorithm to fail by introducing a repeated factor, for instance when is a square. But it then suffices to go back to the previous term, where formula_54, and use the regular &quot;ρ&quot; algorithm from there.

== Application ==
The algorithm is very fast for numbers with small factors, but slower in cases where all factors are large. The &quot;ρ&quot; algorithm&#x27;s most remarkable success was the 1980 factorization of the Fermat number = 1238926361552897 × 93461639715357977769163558199606896584051237541638188580280321. The &quot;ρ&quot; algorithm was a good choice for because the prime factor = 1238926361552897 is much smaller than the other factor. The factorization took 2 hours on a UNIVAC 1100/42.

== Example: factoring = 10403 = 101 · 103 ==

The following table shows numbers produced by the algorithm, starting with formula_55 and using the polynomial formula_56.
The third and fourth columns of the table contain additional information not known by the algorithm.
They are included to show how the algorithm works. 

The first repetition modulo 101 is 97 which occurs in step 17. The repetition is not detected until step 23, when formula_57. This causes formula_58 to be formula_59, and a factor is found.

== Complexity ==
If the pseudorandom number formula_60 occurring in the Pollard &quot;ρ&quot; algorithm were an actual random number, it would follow that success would be achieved half the time, by the birthday paradox in formula_61 iterations. It is believed that the same analysis applies as well to the actual rho algorithm, but this is a heuristic claim, and rigorous analysis of the algorithm remains open.

<doc id="580673" wikidata="Q1345932" url="?curid=580673" title="Strapping Young Lad">
<text>Strapping Young Lad (SYL) was a Canadian extreme metal band formed by Devin Townsend in Vancouver in 1994. The band started as a one-man studio project; Townsend played most of the instruments on the 1995 debut album, &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot;. By 1997, he had recruited permanent members; this line-up, which consisted of Townsend on vocals and guitar, Jed Simon on guitar, Byron Stroud on bass, and Gene Hoglan on drums, lasted until the band&#x27;s dissolution.

Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s music was characterized by the use of polyrhythmic guitar riffing and drumming, blast beats and wall of sound production. The band&#x27;s musical direction was mainly determined by Townsend, whose battle with mental health and dark sense of humor were major influences on his songwriting. Townsend was also noted for his eccentric appearance and on-stage behavior, which greatly contributed to the band&#x27;s intense live performances.

The band gained critical success and a growing underground fan base from their 1997 album &quot;City&quot;. After a hiatus between 1999 and 2002, the band released three more albums, reaching their commercial peak with the 2006 effort, &quot;The New Black&quot;. Townsend disbanded Strapping Young Lad in May 2007, announcing his decision to retreat from public view while continuing to record solo albums.

== History ==
=== &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot; and &quot;City&quot; (1994–1998) ===
Strapping Young Lad began in 1994 as a solo project of Canadian musician Devin Townsend. Following his work as vocalist on Steve Vai&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Sex &amp; Religion&quot; and its 1994 tour, Townsend believed he had been a &quot;musical whore&quot;, spending &quot;the first five years of [his] career working at the behest of other people&quot;. During a brief stint as touring guitarist for The Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from an A&amp;R representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend&#x27;s recordings as &quot;just noise&quot;. He faced further rejection by Relativity Records, the label behind Vai&#x27;s &quot;Sex &amp; Religion&quot;, who saw no commercial appeal in his music. Century Media Records subsequently contacted the musician, offering him a contract to &quot;make us some extreme albums&quot;. Townsend agreed to a five-album deal with the record label.

Following his tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend began recording and producing his debut album, &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot;, under the moniker Strapping Young Lad. According to Townsend, the recording process took &quot;about a week&quot;. Embracing The Wildhearts&#x27; anarchist approach, &quot;while focusing on dissonance and just being as over-the-top as [he] could&quot;, Townsend sang on the record and performed the majority of its instrumental tracks (with the assistance of a drum machine). A few songs, however, featured local session musicians, including guitarist Jed Simon, Townsend&#x27;s future bandmate.
Released on April 4, 1995, &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot; was not widely recognized in the metal community. The album sold 143 copies in its first six months, but received favorable reviews from the heavy metal press. Its unusual musical ideas—a synthesis of death, thrash, and industrial metal influences—prompted Andy Stout from &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; to call it &quot;one of the most disturbing albums you&#x27;ll hear for a very long time&quot;. Nevertheless, Townsend has repeatedly expressed his distaste for the recording. He dismissed the album in the liner notes of the record&#x27;s 2006 reissue, contending it contained only two great songs. He also deemed its production poor in interviews, referring to the album as &quot;basically a collection
of demos that were remixed&quot;. When Century Media advertised the reissue of &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot; as the &quot;rebirth of a genre-defying classic&quot;, Townsend called it &quot;record company bullshit&quot;.

Townsend recruited a permanent line-up for the second album: Jed Simon on guitar, Byron Stroud on bass, and Gene Hoglan on drums. &quot;City&quot; was released on February 11, 1997, and received highly favorable critical reception. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; praised the album for its heaviness, claiming it sounded like &quot;sticking your head into the jet nozzle of a Stealth Bomber&quot;, while &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; ranked it No. 13 on its &quot;Top 20 Albums of 1997&quot; list. The album soon gained a cult following and a loyal fan base for the band. &quot;City&quot; is considered to be the band&#x27;s best effort by a large number of fans and critics alike. In 2002, the album was No. 45 on &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;69 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot; list, and also appeared on their &quot;Must Have Metal Albums&quot; list in 2005. It also appeared on the &quot;100 Most Important Albums of the Nineties&quot; list conducted by &quot;Terrorizer&quot;. Townsend himself stated &quot;City&quot; &quot;is the real Strapping record. That&#x27;s the ultimate one out of all of them&quot;.

The band embarked on a world tour in 1997 to promote the album, which included dates in Europe, the US and Australia. 
In the spring of 1997, guitarist and singer Chris Valagao Mina joined Strapping Young Lad to play on the Full international and European tours. 
On May 30, 1998, they performed at the Dynamo Open Air festival in Eindhoven, Netherlands, then continued touring the next month in Europe. In June 1998, the group released &quot;No Sleep &#x27;till Bedtime&quot;, a live album containing songs performed at a 1997 performance at the HiFi Bar and Ballroom in Melbourne, Australia. Century Media was not initially interested in releasing a live record, but impressed with Townsend&#x27;s production, the label agreed to release it. The band closed the year playing a few more dates in Japan and Australia.

=== On hiatus (1999–2002) ===
At the end of 1998, Townsend placed Strapping Young Lad on hiatus to concentrate on his solo career and on his work as a record producer. He had already released two solo albums, &quot;Ocean Machine: Biomech&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Infinity&quot; in 1998 and produced several other artists&#x27; albums. Townsend explained numerous conflicts with Century Media, and his struggle with bipolar disorder (for which he checked himself into a psychiatric hospital in early 1998), contributed to the curtailment of Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s activities:
What happened? I signed a shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. I got tired of doing Strapping so I said, &#x27;I can&#x27;t do it anymore.&#x27; Then I freaked out and went into a hospital. My lawyer said that I was under mental duress when I signed the contract so the contract is void. At that point it was like, &#x27;I just won&#x27;t do another Strapping record.&#x27; Yeah, I went down saying &#x27;CM was the shittiest label ever.&#x27; And they went down as saying that I was &#x27;a complete, arrogant psychopath.&#x27;

Townsend remained productive between 1999 and 2002, recording two more solo albums, with Chris Valagao Mina &quot;Physicist&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Terria&quot; in 2001, and producing albums for Zimmers Hole, Stuck Mojo and Soilwork, among others. Although Strapping Young Lad was officially on hiatus, they gave occasional live performances, including an appearance on the Foot In Mouth Tour in 2001 with Fear Factory. During this period, Townsend&#x27;s bandmates were active musically; both Stroud and Hoglan recorded with other bands, and all three were involved in Townsend&#x27;s solo efforts as studio musicians and as part of his live band as well. Hoglan and Simon also formed a side project called Tenet with Grip Inc. bassist Stuart Carruthers and Interzone frontman Rob Urbinati in early 2002.

In December 2001 Townsend announced, contrary to his earlier public statements, a new Strapping Young Lad album would be released in 2002. He emphasized he was not &quot;forcing&quot; his product upon fans to generate record sales, arguing his band—and its contract with Century—was never a lucrative endeavor. Instead, Townsend&#x27;s motivation was the &quot;creative anger&quot; sparked by the September 11, 2001 attacks and further cultivated during their 2001 tour. For the first time, the album would be a product of collaborative writing; the band wrote &quot;about half&quot; of the material on the 2001 Foot In Mouth Tour, and the rest at home, starting January 2002. After playing a small number of festivals in 2002, Strapping Young Lad entered the studio in September of that year, to record their third album.

=== &quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; (2003–2005) ===
The self-titled &quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot; was released on February 11, 2003, and became the band&#x27;s first charting album, entering &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Heatseekers at No. 97. The album received moderate critical success, Nate Smith from Rockzone.com called it a &quot;solid addition to the Townsend catalog&quot;, but &quot;not an instant classic&quot;, Xander Hoose from Chronicles of Chaos called it &quot;a good album&quot;, but also pointed out it is inferior to &quot;City&quot;. &quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot; differed from &quot;City&quot; because it was less industrial and more reminiscent of death metal; the humor pervading the previous two albums became more subdued. The song &quot;Devour&quot; would later appear on the soundtrack for the 2005 film &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;.

The band toured heavily throughout 2003 and 2004, making stops in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Although Townsend stated &quot;Strapping Young Lad&quot; might be the last album, the band re-signed with Century Media Worldwide in March 2004 and announced plans for a new album. On November 2, 2004, Strapping Young Lad released a DVD entitled &quot;For Those Aboot to Rock: Live at the Commodore&quot;, which documented the band&#x27;s January 16, 2004, performance at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver. Bonus features included two music videos, &quot;Relentless&quot; and &quot;Detox&quot;, and interviews with band members.

&quot;Alien&quot; was released on March 22, 2005, selling 3,697 copies in its first week. It reached No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, and No. 35 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Critics praised Townsend&#x27;s inventiveness and the dynamism of the songs in which &quot;melody and discord meet midway&quot;; Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote that &quot;Strapping Young Lad have raised the bar yet again&quot;, while Blabbermouth.net&#x27;s Krista G. called it one of the best albums of the year. Townsend and Hoglan were the primary writers of the album, since Simon and Stroud were busy with other commitments. Townsend explained the experimental noise track &quot;Info Dump&quot; is a reflection on the panicked state of mind that ensued after he stopped taking his medication. The making of &quot;Alien&quot; was documented and made viewable online on Century Media&#x27;s official site in February 2005. It was also available as a bonus DVD of the limited first edition of the album.
&quot;Love?&quot; was chosen as the sole single from the album. Its accompanying music video, inspired by the cult horror film, &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, was directed by Joe Lynch. The video garnered the band wider attention, and helped &quot;Love?&quot; become one of their most recognizable songs. Jed Simon admitted to having produced a video for this particular song because it had &quot;the most commercial potential&quot;. &quot;Love?&quot; was originally one of two confirmed songs for an EP that was supposed to contain four new songs and four covers. Although planned for release in 2003, the EP was eventually canceled. A music video was also filmed for &quot;Zen&quot;; the video itself would also appear in the 2007 film &quot;Shoot &#x27;Em Up&quot;.

The band embarked on a headlining tour in the United States in April and May 2005, then went on to tour in Europe. Starting at the end of June, they toured North America as part of the Sounds of the Underground tour, then joined Fear Factory on the Transgression Tour in the U.S. Throughout the tour, Fear Factory bassist Stroud performed with both bands at every concert. Strapping Young Lad concluded the year with a tour in the UK. While on tour, the band started writing the next album, then continued the work in January 2006, and finished the album by May. In the same month, Townsend announced his intention to &quot;take a hiatus from making records for a while&quot; after the end of touring due to exhaustion from continuous recording and producing for the past ten years.

=== &quot;The New Black&quot; (2006) ===

&quot;The New Black&quot;, Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s fifth and final studio album, was released on July 11, 2006. Century Media imposed a strict deadline on the release date of the album; it was to be ready before the 2006 Ozzfest. Despite this, Townsend stated the recording was not rushed, and &quot;The New Black&quot; became a critical, as well as a commercial, success. It was more melodic than any of the band&#x27;s previous albums and brought back the debut album&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek humor. Having sold more than 4,000 copies during its first week, &quot;The New Black&quot; reached No. 200 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, No. 15 on the Top Independent Albums, and No. 8 on the Top Heatseekers charts. Stylus Magazine&#x27;s Cosmo Lee described it as &quot;heavy, catchy, and with no filler&quot;, and About.com&#x27;s Chad Bowar was also positive, stating that &quot;this is a CD that&#x27;s dense and heavy, but also has some memorable hooks&quot;.

A music video was shot in late May to accompany the sole single from the album, &quot;Wrong Side&quot;. In June 2006 Strapping Young Lad embarked on a short festival tour of Europe, including performances at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals in Germany and the Download Festival in England, which was followed by a second stage appearance at Ozzfest in July and August, where they played to some of their largest audiences in their career.

=== Dissolution (2006) ===
Townsend recalls that after &quot;Alien&quot;, he already knew that he wouldn&#x27;t want to continue SYL as a project, and that he already wished to abandon SYL after the release of &quot;City&quot;, considering the project&#x27;s purpose fulfilled. In an interview conducted by &quot;Terrorizer&quot; in August 2006, Townsend explained why he decided to put the band on hold:
At the end of the day, man, I&#x27;m just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I was just like, I&#x27;m going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front of a lot of people at Download, then I&#x27;m just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don&#x27;t wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other projects by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don&#x27;t think it needs to go any further than this.
Although Hoglan initially denied the definitive break-up of the band, saying they would go on tour in March 2007, he later stated Strapping Young Lad is on &quot;extended hiatus&quot;, and might never reunite again. In May 2007, during a press conference held to promote his new solo album, &quot;Ziltoid the Omniscient&quot;, Townsend announced his plans to retreat from public view, including giving interviews and touring, to concentrate on his family, and producing solo albums, as well as other people&#x27;s music. As a result, Strapping Young Lad were effectively disbanded. Townsend discussed his future projects in a May 2007 &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; interview, where he stated &quot;there may be some stuff I do in the future that is as brutal and heavy as Strapping, it&#x27;s just not going to be Strapping&quot;. At the time, Townsend&#x27;s decision to dissolve the band caused a rift between himself and the remainder of the band, who considered SYL to be at the peak of their popularity and potential at the time; according to Simon, the rest of the band remained estranged from Townsend as a result for a time.

===Re-releases and occasional performances===
The remastered 10th anniversary edition of &quot;City&quot; was released on June 7, 2007, in similar vein to the 2006 remaster of &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot;, with bonus tracks and extended liner notes by Townsend. A career spanning best of album, entitled &quot;1994–2006 Chaos Years&quot;, was released on March 31, 2008, with a bonus DVD of live performances and all of the band&#x27;s music videos.

During his career-retrospective concert &quot;The Retinal Circus&quot; in October 2012, Townsend introduced Jed Simon on stage and performed two SYL songs, &quot;Love?&quot; and &quot;Detox&quot;. Townsend has since stated that this was a one-off performance and that he is not interested in getting SYL back together or playing songs at future shows. He posted to Twitter that he no longer feels the same connection to SYL&#x27;s music and that this performance was closure for him and Strapping. In an interview on the &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; podcast, Townsend said that while he still connects to the music, SYL required him to go to extremes that took a toll on him. On his own website, he reiterates that SYL was a project that he eventually perceived to be harmful to his mental and physical health. In 2013, he played &quot;Love?&quot; at concerts in Mexico and Chile as a &quot;cover song&quot;, but later expressed regretting the decision saying it &quot;confuses people&quot;.

Townsend would occasionally perform an acoustic version of &quot;Love?&quot; during his &quot;An Evening with Devin Townsend&quot; shows through the UK in 2015 and 2019. In 2016, on tour with the Devin Townsend project, he would sometimes play a humorous acoustic version of &quot;Detox&quot;. In 2019 he announced that during his touring cycle for &quot;Empath&quot;, he would also perform SYL songs, saying that &quot;It&#x27;s a big part of what I do and it&#x27;s a big part of who I am, and I think I&#x27;ve denied that for a certain amount of time.&quot;

Townsend played several SYL songs during the 70,000 Tons of Metal festival, including &quot;Aftermath&quot;, &quot;Love?&quot;, &quot;Detox&quot;, &quot;All Hail the New Flesh&quot; and a live debut of &quot;Almost Again&quot; from the 2006 album, &quot;The New Black&quot;.

== Musical style, influences and lyrical themes ==
Strapping Young Lad is known for their industrial thrash metal sound while also blending it with elements of black metal, death metal, groove metal, and noise. Many of the band&#x27;s songs showcased Townsend&#x27;s versatile vocal style, often changing from screaming and growling to clean vocals or even falsetto within the course of a single song. According to Townsend, the band functioned as his &quot;outlet to freak out&quot;, and his two main projects, the more melodic The Devin Townsend Band and the aggressive Strapping Young Lad were &quot;supposed to be the positive and the negative&quot;. To achieve a chaotic and cacophonic sound the band utilized complex time signatures, polyrhythmic composition, blast beats, sampling, keyboard effects and intricately layered production. Townsend used the newest technology available, such as Pro Tools, Steinberg Cubase and Logic Pro, when recording, mixing and producing the band&#x27;s songs. As a self-proclaimed &quot;fan of multitracking&quot;, he created an atmospheric, layered &quot;wall of sound&quot;, which became a hallmark of the band&#x27;s production style (with the exception of their self-titled album which featured no samples, or vocal layering). Townsend&#x27;s musical ideas and production style have drawn comparisons to Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. Strapping Young Lad mostly eschewed guitar solos until &quot;The New Black&quot;, which featured a more heightened emphasis on melody than their previous albums.

=== Influences ===
Strapping Young Lad drew influence from a wide range of music genres, most prominently, but not exclusively, heavy metal. Townsend cited, amongst others, Judas Priest, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Zoviet France, Grotus, and Frank Zappa as his influences, and also expressed his admiration for Meshuggah on several occasions, calling them &quot;the best metal band on the planet&quot;. Simon and Stroud listed classic hard rock bands, like AC/DC, Led Zeppelin and Kiss, and old school thrash and death metal bands, like Exodus, Slayer and Morbid Angel among their influences, while Hoglan&#x27;s influences range wildly in style from Stevie Wonder to progressive rock drummers like Neil Peart, Terry Bozzio and Nick Mason. Townsend stated his main influences for &quot;Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing&quot; were Napalm Death and Fear Factory, &quot;City&quot; was influenced by bands such as Foetus and White Noise, and &quot;The New Black&quot;&#x27;s influences were Meshuggah, and &quot;more traditional metal&quot; like Metallica.

=== Lyrical themes ===
Townsend was the band&#x27;s primary songwriter. While the first two albums were solely his work, subsequent albums featured a minority of &quot;riffs, lyrical ideas, and song titles&quot; by his bandmates.

Despite the brutality of Strapping Young Lad&#x27;s music, their songs contain hints of tongue-in-cheek humor and self-parody. Frequently, Townsend&#x27;s lyrics approached serious personal or political issues with a morbid sense of humor. He has likened the band&#x27;s sense of silliness to that of &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. Townsend&#x27;s lyrical influences covered a wide range of themes, including warfare, mathematical theorems, and movies. He also used the technique of cross-referencing, repeating lines from his own works, such as older Strapping Young Lad, or solo material.

== Live performances ==
Strapping Young Lad was known for its energetic live performances, mostly owing to the eccentric appearance and persona of Devin Townsend. Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote &quot;Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend&quot;, and called Strapping Young Lad &quot;one of the best live bands around&quot;. Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.

The band&#x27;s humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled &quot;Far Beyond Metal&quot;, a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on &quot;No Sleep &#x27;till Bedtime&quot;, and on the &quot;For Those Aboot to Rock&quot; DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during &quot;The New Black&quot; sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used &quot;Blame Canada&quot;, a comedic anti-Canada song from &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.

For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend&#x27;s solo material live. In 1998, after the release of &quot;Infinity&quot;, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend&#x27;s solo songs, as two separate sets. It was not until the 2003 release of &quot;Accelerated Evolution&quot; that Townsend formed a separate band, called The Devin Townsend Band, to act as his full-fledged solo band.

<doc id="580692" wikidata="Q3487010" url="?curid=580692" title="Morton Kaplan">
<text>Morton A. Kaplan (May 9, 1921 – September 26, 2017) was an American political scientist who was Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science, Emeritus, at the University of Chicago. He was also President of the Professors World Peace Academy International; and Editor of the World&amp;I magazine from its founding in 1986 until 2004.

== Early life and education ==
He attended Temple University and Stanford University, and received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1951. He has held fellowships from the Center of International Studies at Princeton University and from the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. He was also a Carnegie Traveling Fellow. 

== Academic career ==
His many books include &quot;Science, Language and the Human Condition&quot;, &quot;Law in a Democratic Society&quot;, and &quot;System and Process in International Politics&quot; (1957), a seminal work in the scientific study of international relations.

Kaplan introduced a new analytical tool to the study of international relations, systems analysis. His view contrasts with that of John Rawls - that it might be possible to isolate some basic social and political rules; rather Kaplan&#x27;s alternative theory of justice is his &quot;test in principle&quot;, a kind of decision procedure for evaluating social, political, and moral choices, which attempts to circumvent the limitations of an egocentric or culturally narrow perspective while providing sufficient context to make a judgment. Kaplan used systems analysis to differentiate among the various types of international state systems: the &quot;balance of power&quot; system, the loose bipolar system, the tight bipolar system, the universal international system, the hierarchical international system, and the Unit Veto International System. Kenneth E. Boulding and Charles Kindleberger gave Kaplan&#x27;s &quot;System and Process in International Politics&quot; negative reviews. Kindleberger argued that the book was a &quot;must&quot; read and that the primary contribution of the book was Kaplan&#x27;s discussion of the international system and balance of power, but he argued that Kaplan&#x27;s work did not lend itself to empirical testing, and that the application of game theory to politics and conflict was problematic.

He co-authored &quot;The Political Foundations of International Law&quot; with Nicholas deB. Katzenbach in 1961 where they write, To understand the substance and limits of such constraining rules (international law), it is necessary to examine the interests which support them in the international system, the means by which they are made effective, and the functions they perform. Only in this way is it possible to predict the areas in which rules operate, the limits of rules as effective constraints, and the factors which underlie normative change. He was a critic of communism and of the policies of the Soviet Union. In 1979 he edited &quot;The Many Faces of Communism&quot;.

<doc id="580713" wikidata="Q2607593" url="?curid=580713" title="Virtual sex">
<text>Virtual sex is sexual activity where two or more people (or one person and a virtual character) gather together via some form of communications equipment to arouse each other, often by the means of transmitting sexually explicit messages. Virtual sex describes the phenomenon, no matter the communications equipment used.
* Digital remote stimulation involves the use of electronic sex toys to stimulate a person in the genital area from a distance
* Camming is virtual sex that is over video chat from services that provide it.
* Cybersex is virtual sex typed over the Internet, including IRC, e-mail, instant messaging, chat rooms, webcam, role-playing games, &quot;etc.&quot; 
* Phone sex is virtual sex spoken over the telephone.
* Sexting is virtual sex sent via mobile phone network text messaging. The advent of cell phones with built-in digital cameras has undoubtedly added new dimensions to these activities.
* Modern consumer virtual reality headsets allow users to engage in virtual sex through simulated environments, either with other humans or with virtual characters.

These terms and practices continuously evolve as technologies and methods of communication change.

Increases in Internet connectivity, bandwidth availability, and the proliferation of webcams have also had implications for virtual sex enthusiasts. It is increasingly common for these activities to include the exchange of pictures or motion video. There are companies which allow paying customers to watch people have live sex or masturbate and at the same time allow themselves to be watched as well. Recently, devices have been introduced and marketed to allow remote-controlled stimulation.

== Consent ==
An important part of taking part in virtual sex, or sexual acts, would be consent. The ethics of sexting are already being established by young people for whom consent figures as a critical concept. Distinctions between positive and negative experiences of sexting are mostly dependent on whether consent was given to make and share the images. , it is illegal for any person under the age of 18 to consent to any form of virtual sex (only if nude pictures are sent), because images of minors are considered child pornography.

== Addiction ==
There are approximately one half to 2 million sex addicts in the world that have access to the Internet and the prospectives of virtual sex on the Internet are appealing to them. The internet opens up a world where people can reinvent themselves and try on a completely different online persona; they can freely experiment with and explore a variety of new, hidden or repressed sexual behaviors, fetishes and sexual fantasies. This can feel liberating, but can also be extremely dangerous as it has the potential of becoming addicting and have adverse effects on cybernauts&#x27; other aspects of life. What attracts people to sex via the Internet can be explained by the “Triple A” engine of Affordability, Accessibility, and Anonymity. The &quot;Triple A&quot; engine represents the risk factors for people that are already susceptible to sexual compulsivity or psychological vulnerability related to sexual compulsivity.

Affordability is about the cheap price of virtual sex. Pornography magazines and videos used to have a price of $20 or more per individual piece, while today anyone can have access to unlimited amount of pornographic content at the price of a $20 monthly subscription to the internet. Accessibility is a person&#x27;s capacity to have access to the Internet - a service that is virtually accessible to anyone in the world. Finally, Anonymity references the ability to have access to sexual content without disclosing your true identity; this can feel empowering and make it that much easier to have sex, as one would not have to risk being seen by someone they know and feel ashamed or worried of possible gossips and rumors about them.

When does healthy virtual sex become a pathology? Addiction is defined by 3 main characteristics: compulsivity (not being able to freely choose when to stop or continue a behavior), continuation of the behavior despite adverse consequences, and obsession with the activity. When one losses control and lets virtual sex impact negatively at least one aspect of their life, this is when it stops being healthy. According to clinical studies, the main adverse consequences of virtual sex addiction are about the damage it causes in marital and other romantic relationships, disrupted due to online affairs and online sexual compulsivity. In a research study, it was found that online affairs and sexual compulsivity were reported by 53% of the virtual sex addicts interviewed to be the cause of disruption of their romantic relationships.

Virtual sex can become a coping mechanism to temporarily escape real life problems. However, it is not an effective one and even potentially harmful, as the underlying issues will go on unaddressed and only become more complex with time. Generally, there are a couple of patterns explaining why one can become addicted to virtual sex and the ways one can use it as a coping mechanism. Often, it is used to cope with emotional problems. Virtual sex can serve as a distraction from painful emotions, such as loneliness, stress, and anxiety, as consuming online pornographic content makes the addict feel more confident, desirable, and excited, creating a numbing effect. Another pattern involves young, insecure, socially awkward or emotionally troubled people who use internet to interact with others online rather than in person in order to avoid rejection from a real person. In the Internet they can find a virtually unlimited number of people who seem interesting and interested in them. They find the online world more comforting and safe, as it is harder to pick on social clues of disapproval or judgement. Gradually online friends can become more &quot;real&quot; than offline friends and an online friend can become an opportunity for online affair and cybersex. Partners that are cheated on through online affairs feel that online affairs are just as painful as offline ones - it is a significant source of stress, makes them feel betrayed as they were lied to, and feel insecure as they will negatively compare themselves with the online women or men. Virtual sex can become an escape and a new addiction for recovering sex addicts that are going through a stressful period in their life. Feeling triggered by life problems, prior sex addicts can find themselves using online pornographic content as a quick and easy, but temporary fix to help them soothe themselves, forget about life&#x27;s problems, and feel better about themselves. Another pattern is when an individual takes advantage of the online sexual content to explore forbidden, hidden, and repressed sexual fantasies, which can become addicting and completely absorb the person into this virtual space.

== Long-distance relationships ==
Approximately 14 million people in the United States are in a long distance relationship. Among young adults, 40% to 50% are in a long distance relationship at any given time, as well as 75% of college students at least at one given moment during their studies. It is expected that the number of long distance relationships will be increasing due to the globalized nature of today&#x27;s world. Hence, the internet might be a useful tool to make long distance relationships work. One way couples in long distance relationships engage in a sexual activity online is through sexting. Self-expression through sexting between partners can create a feeling of intimacy and closeness between partners even at a distance. Long distance relationships may be more susceptible to sexual boredom, hence sexting can be an effective way of keeping partners sexually engaged at a distance. In a study, the associations between sexting and feelings of closeness were studied. It was found that more sexting more often in a long distance relationship was not predictive of higher interpersonal closeness between the partners. However, there was found a correlation between sexting and sexual satisfaction, as well as relationship satisfaction.

<doc id="580715" wikidata="Q839512" url="?curid=580715" title="Mammary intercourse">
<text>Mammary intercourse is a sex act, performed as either foreplay or as non-penetrative sex, that involves the stimulation of a man&#x27;s penis by a woman&#x27;s breasts and vice versa. It involves placing the penis between a woman&#x27;s breasts and moving the penis up and down to simulate sexual penetration and to create sexual pleasure.

==Practice==
Mammary intercourse involves a man kneeling or sitting on a woman&#x27;s stomach or chest, placing his erect penis on her cleavage, and rubbing or thrusting while the breasts are squeezed around the penile shaft, by either the woman or the man, creating tightness similar to masturbation, and in simulation of penetrative sex. A lubricant or saliva may be used between the breasts or on the penis. Alternatively, the woman can tighten her breasts around the penis and move them back and forth. Other positions involve either the man standing while the woman kneels, or the man laying back with the woman on top.

In some cases, mammary intercourse can be combined with oral sex. Mammary intercourse may be carried out face to face or head to tail. 

Mammary intercourse is mostly suited for women with naturally larger breasts, while it is recommended that women with smaller breasts be on top. Smaller female breasts, however, tend to be more sensitive than larger ones.

The woman normally does not receive direct sexual stimulation during mammary intercourse, other than the erotic stimulation of bringing her partner to orgasm, without sexual penetration. However, Alex Comfort has said that mammary intercourse can produce orgasm in women with sensitive breasts (what Margot Anand terms &quot;local orgasms of the breast&quot;), and it was one of the nine substitute exercises for penetrative sexual activities, as detailed in the &quot;Paradis Charnels&quot; of 1903. It is possible for the man to perform a fingering on the woman during mammary intercourse.

Since mammary intercourse is a non-penetrative sex act, the risk of passing a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that requires direct contact between the mucous membranes and pre-ejaculate or semen is greatly reduced. HIV is among the infections that require such direct contact and is therefore very unlikely to be transmitted via mammary intercourse. A study of the condom usage habits of New Zealand&#x27;s sex workers said that they offered various safe sex alternatives to vaginal sex to clients who refused to wear a condom. One sex worker said that mammary intercourse was one alternative used; mammary intercourse performed by a woman with large breasts felt to the client like penetrative vaginal sex.

Depictions of the practice, at least in advertising, have been described as pornographic or erotic. Mammary intercourse has sometimes been considered a perversion. Sigmund Freud, however, considered such extensions of sexual interest to fall within the range of the normal, unless marked out by exclusivity (i.e. the repudiation of all other forms of sexual contact).

==Slang terms==
Slang terms for mammary intercourse include:

*Titty-fuck, titjob or titfuck in the United States
*Tit wank or French fuck in the United Kingdom – the latter term dating back to the 1930s; while a more jocular equivalent is &quot;a trip down mammary lane&quot;.

<doc id="580725" wikidata="Q609196" url="?curid=580725" title="Jess Margera">
<text>Jesse Margera (born August 28, 1978) is an American musician. He is best known as the drummer of the rock band CKY, which he co-founded in 1998. Prior to CKY, Margera performed in the band Foreign Objects with former CKY vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller, and he has since worked with Gnarkill, Viking Skull, The Company Band, Fuckface Unstoppable, and Sovereign Eagle. Margera has also appeared in the &quot;CKY&quot; video series and the &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; and &quot;Jackass&quot; television series alongside his brother Bam.

==Early life==
Margera was born on August 28, 1978, and raised in West Chester, Pennsylvania to April and Phil Margera. He is the older brother of professional skateboarder and TV personality Bam Margera, alongside whom he is considered a founding member of the CKY crew, which worked on the video series of the same name. He chose to play the drums as he had two uncles who played the instrument, one of whom later worked as a drum technician on a CKY tour. His &quot;biggest influence&quot; was Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, but as a young musician he also took an interest in jazz drummers such as Elvin Jones.

==Career==

===1993–2002: Foreign Objects, CKY and Gnarkill===
Margera first played in a band in 1991 or 1992. One of his first bands was Soalroach, which featured brother Bam and friend Ryan Dunn. He later formed Foreign Objects with future CKY vocalist and guitarist Deron Miller, whom he originally met at high school. The band released its debut extended play (EP) &quot;The Undiscovered Numbers &amp; Colors&quot; in 1995. Along with bassist Ryan Bruni, the duo later performed under the name Oil, before meeting guitarist Chad I Ginsburg (who was then working as an audio engineer) and changing the name of the band to CKY. Speaking about the formation of the band, Margera recalled in a 2003 interview that the main reason he joined CKY was Miller&#x27;s guitar playing ability, particularly his ability to write &quot;complicated [guitar] riffs that are catchy&quot;.

As a member of CKY, Margera performed drums on all five of the band&#x27;s studio albums, and was credited for contributing to songwriting on &quot;Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild&quot;.

Margera was also member of the CKY-related comedy band Gnarkill, formed in 2002, alongside Brandon DiCamillo on vocals, guitarist Rich Vose and brother Bam on keyboards; he performed on both studio albums: 2002&#x27;s &quot;Gnarkill&quot; and 2006&#x27;s &quot;GnarKill vs. Unkle Matt and the ShitBirdz&quot;.

===2002–2011: Viking Skull and The Company Band===

In November 2006, it was announced that Margera had joined English band Viking Skull, replacing founding member Gordon Morrison. Speaking about his replacement of Morrison, Margera revealed that he unwittingly contributed to the temporary breakup of the band in 2006, after drinking heavily with the band on tour. The new lineup released the album &quot;Chapter Two&quot; in September 2007, which was mixed by CKY guitarist Chad I Ginsburg. Viking Skull and Ginsburg (this time as producer) worked together again for the follow-up album &quot;Doom, Gloom, Heartache &amp; Whiskey&quot;, recorded and released in 2008 in the US. The CKY collaboration was extended further, as Joe Frantz and Margera&#x27;s brother Bam directed the music video for the song &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot;.

In addition to his work with CKY and Viking Skull, in 2007 Margera formed The Company Band, a supergroup featuring Clutch frontman Neil Fallon and Fireball Ministry frontman James Rota. Each of the bands had toured with one another between 2005 and 2006, after which the group began jamming together and eventually formed into an official band. With the addition of guitarist Dave Bone and bassist Jason Diamond, the band recorded its debut EP &quot;Sign Here, Here and Here&quot; with producer Andrew Alekel and released it later in the year. The band recorded its full-length debut in 2009, and released it in November that year as &quot;The Company Band&quot;. Another EP, &quot;Pros &amp; Cons&quot;, was released in 2012.

===2011–present: Fuckface Unstoppable and future===
The fate of CKY was cast into doubt in 2011, when the band released a video in which each member spoke about their desires for the future of the band; all members but Ginsburg wanted to record solo albums, while the guitarist favored releasing another CKY album. Miller later claimed that Ginsburg had left the band, while Margera tried to calm the situation by suggesting that Miller had problems with alcohol abuse, and that he needed &quot;support ... not insult[s]&quot;. Margera, along with Ginsburg and bassist Matt &quot;Matty J&quot; Janaitis, later returned as CKY in 2012 with Year Long Disaster frontman Daniel Davies in place of Miller. This lineup (with Matt Deis in place of Janaitis) later reunited in 2015, following another split with Miller. Margera has claimed that Davies offered to join the band during a phone call with the drummer, after he had performed on the singer&#x27;s solo album.

Margera also performs drums in brother Bam&#x27;s group Fuckface Unstoppable, and has contributed to both studio albums: &quot;Stórfréttir Í Reykjavík&quot; and &quot;Fuckface Unstoppable&quot;.

On June 16, 2017, the fifth CKY album titled &quot;The Phoenix&quot; was released.

Jess and Ginsburg are currently working on a new CKY album, titled &quot;New Reason to Dream&quot;.

<doc id="580726" wikidata="Q3209081" url="?curid=580726" title="The Mark Steel Lectures">
<text>The Mark Steel Lectures are a series of radio and television programmes. Written and delivered by Mark Steel, each scripted lecture presents arguments for the importance of a historical figure.

== History ==
The lectures were originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4 over three series between 1999 and 2002. Many of the arguments were illustrated by miniature sketches. These sketches featured Mark Steel, Martin Hyder, Mel Hudson, Carla Mendonça, Femi Elufowoju Junior and Debbie Isitt. The first series was subtitled &quot;A series of lectures about Englishmen who changed the course of history&quot;, with the remaining two changing this to &quot;A series of lectures about people with a passion&quot;. The first series was produced by Phil Clark; the others by Lucy Armitage. The lecture on Ludwig van Beethoven (2003) was nominated for a Sony Radio Comedy Award.

The programme transferred to television in 2003, with an Open University series on BBC Four, which was later repeated on BBC Two. This variously featured:

*Gerard Logan as Lord Byron
*Martin Hyder as Isaac Newton, Sigmund Freud, Aristotle, Che Guevara, Oliver Cromwell, Ludwig van Beethoven and Charles Darwin
*Ainsley Harriott as Robert Boyle
*Linda Smith as Martha Freud
*Emma Kennedy as Mary Shelley and Sylvia Pankhurst
*Various celebrities, including Mark Lamarr, Bob Monkhouse and Paul Merton, as themselves.

Like the radio version, the television series was written by Mark Steel, and features a series of sketches, often setting historical events in the modern day, and making numerous pop culture references. This version saw Steel deliver his lectures on location, with different sections of each programme coming from locations relevant to that part of the story. Unlike the radio version, there were no audience sounds, which some critics suggested made the comedy sections feel out of place . The television series was directed by Michael Cumming, and produced by Jon Rolph. The executive producers were Emma De&#x27;Ath and Graham Smith.

The programme was nominated for a BAFTA award in 2004 for best television comedy. Although the radio series has been released on CD, there are no plans to release DVDs of the television series.

<doc id="580730" wikidata="Q939691" url="?curid=580730" title="Swazi people">
<text>The Swazi or Swati (Swati: &quot;Emaswati&quot;, singular &quot;Liswati&quot;) are a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa, inhabiting Eswatini, a sovereign kingdom in Southern Africa, and South Africa&#x27;s Mpumalanga province. AmaSwati are part of the Nguni-language speaking peoples whose origins can be traced through archaeology to East Africa where similar traditions, beliefs and cultural practices are found.

The Swati people and the Kingdom of Eswatini today are named after Mswati II, who became king in 1839 after the death of his father King Sobhuza. Eswatini was a region first occupied by the San people and the current Swazis migrated from north East Africa through to Mozambique and eventually settled in Eswatini in the 15th century. Their royal lineage can be traced to a chief named Dlamini I; this is still the royal clan name. About three-quarters of the clan groups are Nguni; the remainder are Sotho, Tsonga, others North East African and San descendants. These groups have intermarried freely. Swazi identity extends to all those with allegiance to the twin monarchs Ingwenyama &quot;the Lion&quot; (the king) and Indlovukati &quot;the She-Elephant&quot; (the queen mother). The dominant Swati language and culture are factors that unify Swatis as a nation.

==History==
amaSwati are native to Southern Africa. The term &quot;bakaNgwane&quot; (&quot;Ngwane&#x27;s people&quot;) is still used as an alternative to &quot;emaSwati&quot;, to refer to the Swati people. EmaSwati are people who are predominantly descended from Nguni-language speakers. However some of the Swati people originate from Sotho clans who were also inhabitants of Eswatini. Under the leadership of Dlamini III who took over from the Maseko and settlement took place in 1750, along the Pongola River where it cuts through the Lubombo mountains. Later on, they moved into a region on the Pongola River, which was in close proximity to the Ndwandwe people. Dlamini III&#x27;s successor was Ngwane III, who is considered the first King of modern Eswatini. He ruled from around 1745 until 1780 at the Shiselweni region of Eswatini.

In 1815, Sobhuza I became the king of Eswatini and was responsible for the establishment of Swati power in central Eswatini. Here the Swati people continued the process of expansion by conquering numerous small Sotho and Nguni-speaking tribes to build up a large composite state today called Eswatini. Sobhuza I&#x27;s rule occurred during the Mfecane. Under Sobhuza&#x27;s leadership, the Nguni and Sotho peoples as well as remnant San groups were integrated into the Swati nation. It was during his rule that the present boundaries of Eswatini were fully under the rule of the Dlamini kings.

In the late 1830s, initial contact occurred with the Boers, who were settling in the territory that would become the South African Republic. A substantial portion of Swati territory was ceded to the Transvaal Boers who settled around the Lydenburg area in the 1840s. The territory of Eswatini, and their king, Mswati II, were recognized by both the Transvaal and Britain. It was during the rule of Mswati II that the Swati nation was unified. Thereafter, the label &quot;Swati&quot; eventually was applied to all the peoples who gave allegiance to the Ingwenyama.

Later under Mbandzeni, many commercial, land, and mining concessions were granted to British and Boer settlers. This move led to further loss of land to the South African Republic. The result was that a substantial Swati population ended up residing outside Eswatini in South Africa. The Pretoria Convention for the Settlement of the Transvaal in 1881 recognized the independence of Eswatini and defined its boundaries. The Ngwenyama was not a signatory, and the Swazi claim that their territory extends in all directions from the present state. Britain claimed authority over Eswatini in 1903, and independence was regained in 1968.

Today, Swati people reside in both Eswatini and South Africa. People of Swati descent in South Africa are typically identifiable by speaking siSwati, or a dialect of that language. There are also many Swati migrants in South Africa and the United Kingdom. The number of emaSwati in South Africa is slightly larger than that of emaSwati in Eswatini, which is approximately 1.2 million people. In modern-day Eswatini, Swati people include all Eswatini citizens regardless of their ethnicity.

==Identity==
The Kings of Eswatini date back to some considerable time to when the royal line of Dlamini lived in the vicinity of Delagoa Bay. The Swazi people as a nation were originally formed by 17 clans known as bemdzabuko (&quot;true Swazi&quot;) who accompanied the Dlamini kings in the early days. The 17 founding clans were Dlamini, Nhlabathi, Hlophe, Kunene, Mabuza, Madvonsela, Mamba, Matsebula, Mdluli, Motsa, Ngwenya, Shongwe, Sukati, Tsabedze, Tfwala, Mbokane and Zwane. Other Swazi clans are the Emakhandzambili clans (&quot;those found ahead&quot;, e.g. the Gamedze, Fakudze, Ngcamphalala and Magagula), meaning that they were on the land prior to Dlamini immigration and conquest. The Emafikemuva (&quot;those who came behind&quot;) who joined the kingdom later.

==Culture==

Dancing and singing, including praise-singing, are prominent in Swazi culture. Pottery and carving were minor arts. Swazi traditional marriage is called &quot;umtsimba&quot;; it is usually on a weekend in the dry season (June to August). The bride and her relatives go to the groom&#x27;s homestead on Friday evening. On Saturday morning, the bridal party sit by a nearby river and eat goat or cow meat offered by the groom&#x27;s family; in the afternoon, they dance in the groom&#x27;s homestead. On Sunday morning, the bride, with her female relatives, stabs the ground with a spear at the groom&#x27;s cattle kraal; later she is smeared with red ochre. The smearing is the high point of marriage: no woman can be smeared twice. The bride presents gifts to her husband and his relatives. Umhlanga is one of the most well-known cultural events in Eswatini held in August/September for young unmarried girls to pay homage to the Ndlovukati. Incwala is another Swazi cultural event held in December/January, depending on the phases of the moon. This ceremony, also known as the &quot;First Fruits&quot; ceremony, marks the King&#x27;s tasting of the new harvest.

==Religion==
The traditional Swazi religion recognizes a supreme God/creator in its pure form while the ancestors are recognized. The Swazi religion is based on a creator known as &quot;Mvelincanti&quot; (he who was there from the beginning). Most Swazis intertwine this belief with modern day Christianity that was brought by the missionaries. Many continue to practice their traditional spiritual beliefs. Spiritual rituals are performed at the level of family associated with birth, death and marriage.

<text>BYO Split Series Volume III is a split album featuring the American punk rock bands Rancid and NOFX. It was released on March 5, 2002 through BYO Records&#x27; as the third entry in their &quot;BYO Split Series&quot;.

The album contains six songs by each band, with each band&#x27;s songs being covers of songs originally performed by the other band.

Two versions of this CD were released. One with a green cover, which had the songs performed by NOFX followed by the songs performed by Rancid, and one with an orange cover, which placed Rancid&#x27;s songs ahead of NOFX&#x27;s (the order of the songs by each band remains identical).

Following the album&#x27;s release, NOFX&#x27;s cover of &quot;Radio&quot; evolved into a live staple having been played at multiple NOFX shows ever since.

<text>Leigh Eddings (September 30, 1937 – February 28, 2007; née Judith Leigh Schall), was the wife of David Eddings and co-author of many of his later works and uncredited co-author of his early works, and married him 27 October 1962.

==Biography==
Born Judith Leigh Schall in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, she met Eddings in Seattle. According to her husband she was part Choctaw.

She had been in the Air Force and had been described by her husband as a world-class cook, highly skilled at fishing, and an excellent shot.

Leigh married David Eddings in 1962, and adopted one boy in 1966, Scott David. They adopted a younger girl between 1966 and 1969. In 1969 they lost custody of both children and each were sentenced to a year in jail from separate trials after pleading guilty to child abuse. The couple kept animal cages in their basement, forcing their children into them for long periods of times as punishment, and on the day of their arrest, were caught red-handed in the act of beating their son. Both children were severely traumatized by the abusive treatment. Though the nature of the abuse, the trial and the sentencing were all extensively reported in South Dakota newspapers at the time, these details of the Eddings&#x27; life never resurfaced during their later successful joint career as fantasy authors, only reappearing several years after both had died. 

After both served their sentences, David and Leigh Eddings moved to Denver in 1971, where David found work in a grocery store.

She co-authored &quot;High Hunt&quot; (1973) with David, and all of David&#x27;s subsequent books, but was not credited as a co-author until the publication of &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot; in 1995. It was Lester del Rey who believed that multi-authorships were a problem and that it would be better if David Edding&#x27;s name alone appeared on the books.

Suffering a series of strokes, Leigh died 28 February 2007 in Carson City, Nevada.

<doc id="580758" wikidata="Q2411994" url="?curid=580758" title="Esteban Rodríguez Miró">
<text>Esteban Rodríguez Miró y Sabater (1744 – June 4, 1795), also known as Esteban Miro and Estevan Miro, was a Spanish army officer and governor of the Spanish provinces of Louisiana and Florida. He was one of the most popular of the Spanish governors, largely because of his prompt response to the New Orleans Fire of 1788, which destroyed almost all of the city.

==Early life==
Esteban Miró was born in Reus (currently in the province of Tarragona, Catalonia), Spain, to Francisco Miró and Marian de Miró y Sabater. He joined the military in 1760 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Around 1765, he was transferred to Mexico and rose to the rank of lieutenant. He returned to Spain in the 1770s and received military training before being sent to Louisiana in 1778.

==Governor of Louisiana==
In 1779 during the American Revolutionary War and Anglo-Spanish War (1779–83), Miró was a part of the forces commanded by Bernardo de Gálvez in campaigns against the British in West Florida. Gálvez appointed Miró as acting Governor of Louisiana (New Spain) on January 20, 1782. He became proprietary governor on December 16, 1785. Spain had taken over this territory from France after the latter&#x27;s defeat in 1763 by Great Britain in the Seven Years&#x27; War.

After the Revolutionary War, Miró was a key figure in Spain&#x27;s boundary dispute with the U.S. over the northern boundary of West Florida. Under Spanish rule, the boundary had been 31° north latitude. In 1763, it came under British control at the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1767, the northern boundary was moved to 32°28&#x27; north latitude (from the current location of Vicksburg, Mississippi, east to the Chattahoochee River).

In 1783, Britain recognized the Spanish conquest of West Florida in the war, but it did not specify the northern border. In the separate treaty with the U.S., Britain specified the southern boundary as 31 degrees north latitude. Spain claimed the British expansion of West Florida, while the U.S. held to the older boundary. Britain had also granted free navigation on the Pearl River to the United States, even in areas where Spain claimed both sides of the river.

In 1784, the Spanish government closed the lower Mississippi River to the Americans, causing significant fear and resentment among settlers in the western frontiers of Kentucky and Tennessee, who depended on river trade and the major port of New Orleans. In 1790, Miró fortified Nogales (present-day Vicksburg) and the mouth of the Mississippi against the possibility of war with the U.S.

The settlers&#x27; anger was directed as much toward the U.S. government for not acting aggressively enough to protect their interests as it was against Spain. A significant faction within Kentucky considered becoming an independent republic rather than joining the U.S. One of the leaders of this faction was James Wilkinson, who met with Miró in 1787, declared his allegiance to Spain, and secretly acted as an agent for Spain. Wilkinson&#x27;s schemes to set up an independent nation friendly to Spain in the west did little except cause controversy. This resurfaced later in another form through Wilkinson&#x27;s dealings with Aaron Burr.

After the Good Friday fire in March of 1788 destroyed almost all of the city of New Orleans, Miró arranged for tents for residents, brought in food from warehouses, sent ships to Philadelphia for aid, and lifted Spanish regulations restricting trade to the city. The city of New Orleans (today&#x27;s French Quarter), was rebuilt with more fire-resistant buildings of brick, plaster, heavy masonry, ceramic tiled roofs, and courtyards. Among the new buildings built under his watch was the Saint Louis Cathedral.

In 1786, Miró enacted the Tignon law, which required Creole of color, Black, and indigenous women to had to wear a scarf or other head covering. Although intended to limit these women and to restrict their fashion choices, the policy lead to a tradition of wearing elaborate tignons.

==Return to Spain==
Miró surrendered governorship at the end of 1791 to return to Spain and serve in the Ministry of War. He served as Field Marshal from 1793-1795 in the war with the French Republic. He died from natural causes during the War of the Pyrenees at the battlefront in June 1795.

==Legacy==
In 1788, North Carolina formed a judicial district called the &quot;Mero District&quot; in its westernmost territory (the area presently around Nashville, Tennessee); it was named after Miró but misspelled by the legislature.

Among Louisianians, Miró is chiefly remembered for having prevented the establishment of the Inquisition in the territory. Charles Gayarré wrote the following account:

&quot;The reverend Capuchin, Antonio de Sedella, who had lately arrived in the province, wrote to the Governor to inform him that he, the holy father, had been appointed Commissary of the Inquisition; that in a letter of the 5th of December last, from the proper authority, this intelligence had been communicated to him, and that he had been requested to discharge his functions with the most exact fidelity and zeal, and in conformity with the royal will. Wherefore, after having made his investigations with the utmost secrecy and precaution, he notified Mirò that, in order to carry, as he was commanded, his instructions into perfect execution in all their parts, he might soon, at some late hour of the night, deem it necessary to require some guards to assist him in his operations.

Not many hours had elapsed since the reception of this communication by the Governor, when night came, and the representative of the Holy Inquisition was quietly reposing in bed, when he was roused from his sleep by a heavy knocking. He started up, and, opening his door, saw standing before him an officer and a file of grenadiers. Thinking that they had come to obey his commands, in consequence of his letter to the Governor, he said: &#x27;My friends, I thank you and his Excellency for the readiness of this compliance with my request. But I have now no use for your services, and you shall be warned in time when you are wanted. Retire then, with the blessing of God.&#x27; Great was the stupefaction of the Friar when he was told that he was under arrest. &#x27;What!&#x27; exclaimed he, &#x27;will you dare lay your hands on a Commissary of the Holy Inquisition?&#x27; — &#x27;I dare obey orders,&#x27; replied the undaunted officer, and the Reverend Father Antonio de Sedella was instantly carried on board of a vessel, which sailed the next day for Cádiz.&quot;

This was an instance of the conflict within the central government at Madrid and also between it and the colonial governors: Miró&#x27;s policy, approved by the Crown, had been to strengthen Louisiana against the United States and other powers by encouraging settlement; this included requiring &quot;public&quot; practice of Catholicism, but ignoring private worship. The royal ministers had ordered an expansion of the Inquisition in response to the French Revolution.

==Personal life==
Miro married Marie Céleste Eléonore de Macarty, cousin to his contemporary, New Orleans Mayor Augustin de Macarty. A niece by marriage was Delphine LaLaurie, aged 8 at his death and later believed to be a serial killer.

==Legacy and honors==
*Miro Street in New Orleans is named in his honor. Once running from the Lower 9th Ward at St. Bernard Parish (&quot;downtown&quot;), to Claiborne Ave. in the Fontainebleau neighborhood (&quot;Uptown&quot;), the street has been broken into several segments by subsequent developments, such as the Industrial Canal.
*General James Wilkinson named the present Mero (sic) Street in Frankfort, Kentucky, for Governor Miró.
*At inception in 1796, half of the newly created State of Tennessee was named for Miró: the Mero District. The name remained in use until at least 1807.

<doc id="580760" wikidata="Q913662" url="?curid=580760" title="The Distillers">
<text>The Distillers are an American punk rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1998 by vocalist and guitarist Brody Dalle. Dalle co-wrote, played guitar and provided lead vocals for nearly every track on the band&#x27;s three albums. After the breakup of the band in 2006, Dalle and Distillers guitarist Tony Bevilacqua went on to form Spinnerette.

==History==
The Distillers first came together in late 1998, when Australian-born guitarist Brody Dalle met bassist Kim Chi and the two bonded over their love for playing punk rock. They proceeded to recruit Detroit guitarist Rose Mazzola and drummer Matt Young.

Signed to Epitaph, the band issued its self-titled debut in April 2000. By the end of the year, Kim Chi had left the group to join Exene Cervenka in her band, the Original Sinners. For a while The Nerve Agents bassist Dante Sigona was playing bass for The Distillers but Ryan Sinn stepped in and took position. Matt departed to join Chi while Mazzola left during the height of &quot;Seneca Falls&quot;. By summer 2002, The Distillers were composed of Dalle, Sinn, and new drummer Andy Granelli; joint American dates with No Doubt and Garbage were planned for later that fall. Guitarist/vocalist Tony Bradley joined The Distillers in time for the recording of their third album and major-label debut, &quot;Coral Fang&quot;, which was released in 2003 by Sire. Following her very public divorce from Rancid&#x27;s Tim Armstrong that same year, Brody Dalle resumed performing under her own name.

Granelli left the band in early 2005, moving on to play with Darker My Love, and by summer, Sinn had exited as well, later joining up with Angels &amp; Airwaves. Despite rumors, The Distillers, now just Dalle and Bradley, denied that they were breaking up, instead simply going on hiatus. In early 2006, Dalle had her first child, daughter Camille, with new husband Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. By the year&#x27;s end, the two remaining members formally announced the band&#x27;s disbandment and went on to form Spinnerette together.

In January 2018, Dalle shared a teaser video from The Distillers&#x27; Instagram and a newly opened Twitter account to confirm the return of the band. Initially, it was believed the four Twitter accounts that The Distillers&#x27; Twitter was following, would make up the 2018 line-up of the band: Dalle, Bradley, Granelli and former Spinnerette member Alain Johannes. Since then, however, the account has removed Johannes; and subsequently added former bassist Sinn. Bradley has since deleted his Twitter account.

It was later announced that the band would perform their first official show in over 13 years at The Casbah in San Diego, California in late April 2018.

On September 11, 2018, the Distillers official Instagram account announced the release of a new single available on iTunes. In April 2019, the band confirmed that they had begun recording their fourth album and follow-up to &quot;Coral Fang&quot;. 

On April 28, 2019, The Distillers announced they would be entering the studio with English music producer Nick Launay.

On July 16, 2021, The Distillers released a live album, &quot;Live in Lockdown&quot;. The album features nine tracks that were recorded live during their 2020 livestream.

<doc id="580769" wikidata="Q1941840" url="?curid=580769" title="Economics in One Lesson">
<text>Economics in One Lesson is an introduction to economics written by Henry Hazlitt and first published in 1946. It is based on Frédéric Bastiat&#x27;s essay &quot;&quot; (English: &quot;What is Seen and What is Not Seen&quot;).

The &quot;One Lesson&quot; is stated in Part One of the book: &quot;The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.&quot; Part Two consists of twenty-four chapters, each demonstrating the lesson by tracing the effects of one common economic belief, and exposing common economic belief as a series of fallacies.

Among its policy recommendations are the advocacy of free trade, an opposition to price controls, an opposition to monetary inflation, and an opposition to fiscal policy, such as stimulative governmental expenditures, arguing: There are men regarded today as brilliant economists, who deprecate saving and recommend squandering on a national scale as the way of economic salvation; and when anyone points to what the consequences of these policies will be in the long run, they reply flippantly, as might the prodigal son of a warning father: &#x27;In the long run we are all dead.&#x27; And such shallow wisecracks pass as devastating epigrams and the ripest wisdom.

==Summary==
In the preface to &quot;Economics in One Lesson,&quot; Henry Hazlitt explains that the book is a critical analysis of economic fallacies that are prevalent and have become a new orthodoxy. The book seeks to dissect and expose these errors, particularly the central error from which they stem. Hazlitt argues that the shortest and surest way to understand economics is through a dissection of such errors. He states that this book is primarily one of exposition and makes no claim to originality with regard to any of the chief ideas that it expounds. Hazlitt acknowledges his indebtedness to Frédéric Bastiat, Philip Wicksteed, and Ludwig von Mises, whose ideas have influenced the present work. He also mentions that when analyzing fallacies, he has thought it less advisable to mention particular names than in giving credit. The object of this book is not to expose the special errors of particular writers, but economic errors in their most frequent, widespread, or influential form. Hazlitt concludes by saying that he hopes that the book will be forgiven for making rare reference to statistics as he believes that those who are interested in specific economic problems are advised to read current &quot;realistic&quot; discussions of them, with statistical documentation.

Chapter 1, &quot;The Lesson&quot;, explains that economics is a field filled with fallacies because of the difficulties inherent in the subject and the special pleading of selfish interests. Every group has economic interests antagonistic to other groups. Another factor is the tendency of people to overlook the secondary consequences of a policy, focusing only on the immediate effects on a specific group. The difference between good and bad economics lies in the ability to look beyond the immediate effects and consider the longer-term and indirect consequences for all groups. Nine-tenths of economic fallacies arise from ignoring this lesson. Finally, the art of economics consists of looking not just at the immediate effects of a policy but at its longer-term effects for all groups.

Chapter 2, &quot;The Broken Window&quot;, uses the example of a broken window to demonstrate what Hazlitt considers the fallacy that destruction can be good for the economy. He argues that while the broken window may create work for the glazier, the money the shopkeeper has to spend on replacing the window means that he cannot spend it elsewhere in the economy, such as on a new suit from a tailor. The potential business for the tailor is lost, and the community is worse off overall. Hazlitt stresses the importance of considering all parties involved in an economic transaction, not just those immediately visible.

Chapter 3, &quot;The Blessings of Destruction&quot;, discusses what Hazlitt considers the persistent fallacy of the broken window, which is often used to justify the benefits of destruction, particularly in times of war. He points out that although destruction may lead to a need for rebuilding, it does not necessarily lead to effective demand or increased purchasing power, as it diverts demand from one area to another. Additionally, wartime inflation, which people may perceive as good economic results, can be produced just as well by peacetime inflation. Finally, the supply of goods is what constitutes demand in an exchange economy, and wartime destruction inevitably leads to a shrinking in total demand.

Chapter 4, &quot;Public Works Mean Taxes&quot;, examines what Hazlitt considers the fallacy of government spending as a solution to economic problems. Hazlitt argues that every dollar of government spending must be raised through a dollar of taxation. Public works, such as streets and roads, armories, and buildings for essential government services are necessary, but public works built primarily &quot;to provide employment&quot; are problematic. When employment becomes the end, need becomes a subordinate consideration, and &quot;projects&quot; have to be invented. Hazlitt concludes that for every public job created by a government project, a private job has been destroyed somewhere else. He argues that government spending is not a panacea and must be viewed in the larger context of secondary consequences, including jobs destroyed by taking money from taxpayers.

Chapter 5, &quot;Taxes Discourage Production&quot;, argues that taxes discourage production and have a negative impact on the economy. The government cannot simply take money from one person and give it to another without consequences. Taxes affect the actions and incentives of those from whom they are taken, and high taxes discourage risk-taking and entrepreneurship, resulting in fewer new jobs and less economic growth. While some taxes are necessary for essential government functions, excessive taxes are counterproductive and discourage private production and employment. The government cannot solve the problem of unemployment by creating it through excessive taxation.

Chapter 6, &quot;Credit Diverts Production&quot;, discusses the dangers of government &quot;encouragement&quot; to businesses in the form of direct grants of government credit or guarantees of private loans. He focuses on government loans to farmers, explaining that proposals for more credit are really proposals for increased debt. Hazlitt argues that loans made by private lenders differ from those made by government agencies because private lenders risk their own funds and are careful to investigate the assets and business acumen of the borrower, whereas government lenders take risks with taxpayers&#x27; money that private lenders will not take. Hazlitt concludes that the faith in government lending policies springs from two acts of shortsightedness: looking at the matter only from the standpoint of the borrowers and thinking only of the first half of the transaction.

Hazlitt argues against the idea of government assuming risks that are &quot;too great for private industry.&quot; This would lead to favoritism, scandals, and an increase in demand for socialism. Hazlitt states that government loans and subsidies to businesses would waste capital and reduce production. Private lenders are cautious with their money and investigate proposals before investing in them, while government lenders are likely to make mistakes and invest in inefficient projects. Government loans and subsidies would tax successful private businesses to support unsuccessful ones, which is not a paying proposition in the long run.

Chapter 7, &quot;The Curse of Machinery&quot;, discusses what Hazlitt considers the myth that machines create unemployment. Hazlitt notes that the belief that machines cause unemployment leads to preposterous conclusions, and cites Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations,&quot; which shows how machinery revolutionized pin-making and increased productivity. Hazlitt also highlights that the Industrial Revolution was met with resistance, particularly in the stocking industry, where machines were destroyed, and the inventors were threatened. Nevertheless, the number of people employed in the cotton industry increased by 4,400%, and technological advances in the maritime and steel industries were met with pessimism, but ultimately led to more efficient production methods.

Hazlitt discusses what he considers the fallacy that labor-saving machinery and technical progress lead to unemployment and misery. The author argues that the introduction of such machinery can increase employment and benefit society. The author uses the example of a clothing manufacturer who adopts a machine that reduces the labor required to make overcoats. Although half of the labor force may be dropped, the manufacturer would have only adopted the machine if it would have saved labor in the long run. After the machine has produced economies sufficient to offset its cost, the manufacturer has more profits than before, which can be used to expand operations, invest in other industries, or increase personal consumption. In any case, these extra profits indirectly provide jobs, and competition among manufacturers can lead to further employment opportunities.

Hazlitt argues that the fear of machines taking jobs is unfounded. He explains that machines do not necessarily replace workers, but they increase production and, thus, raise the standard of living. He gives examples of newly created trades in the past that have created more jobs as the product was improved and the cost reduced. Hazlitt also notes that machines have significantly increased the population of the world as they made it possible to support it. Hazlitt warns, however, that we should not only focus on the long-run and broad view but also consider the immediate effects on certain groups of people. While some may lose jobs, others may gain them or benefit from the increased production and lower prices. Finally, Hazlitt emphasizes that the primary function of machines is to increase production and economic welfare, not necessarily to create jobs.

Chapter 8, &quot;Spread-The-Work Schemes&quot;, discusses what Hazlitt considers the economic fallacy that creating jobs is an end in itself. He argues that this belief is often used to justify inefficient and uneconomical practices, such as the arbitrary subdivision of labor in unions. The author also examines various schemes to &quot;spread the work,&quot; such as shortening the working week, which are proposed to create more jobs. However, he argues that such schemes often lead to a reduction in productivity, and may not necessarily create more jobs. Ultimately, the author contends that the focus should be on increasing productivity, which leads to increased wealth and a higher standard of living for everyone.

Chapter 9, &quot;Disbanding Troops and Bureaucrats&quot;, discusses the fear of unemployment that arises when millions of soldiers are released into the labor market after a war. Hazlitt argues that the fear is misplaced because the soldiers will become self-supporting civilians, and their release from the army will free up funds for taxpayers to buy additional goods, increasing civilian demand and employment. Similarly, he argues that the same reasoning applies to civilian government officials who are not performing services for the community reasonably equivalent to the remuneration they receive. Removing unnecessary officeholders will not cut down on the national income, but instead, will free up funds for taxpayers and encourage officeholders to take up private jobs or start businesses, making them productive members of society.

Chapter 10, &quot;The Fetish of Full Employment&quot;, argues that the goal of any nation should be to maximize production rather than just focusing on full employment. Full employment is a necessary by-product of maximizing production, but it is not the end goal. Hazlitt explains that full employment can be achieved through coercion, such as in Nazi Germany or in prisons, but this does not necessarily lead to maximum production. Hazlitt also criticizes the idea that a thirty-hour workweek or make-work practices are preferable for creating jobs, as they do not necessarily increase productivity or output. Instead, he suggests that policies should be focused on maximizing production to improve the overall standard of living and create more opportunities for distribution.

Chapter 11, &quot;Who&#x27;s &#x27;Protected&#x27; by Tariffs?&quot;, discusses what Hazlitt considers the fallacy of protectionism in international trade. Hazlitt argues that many people and governments fail to see the long-term effects of tariffs and trade barriers and instead focus on the immediate effects on specific groups. He gives the example of an American manufacturer of woolen sweaters who argues that a tariff is necessary to protect his business and the jobs of his employees. However, if the tariff were removed, the prices of the sweaters would decrease, making them more affordable for consumers and leading to an increase in employment in other industries. Additionally, the purchase of English sweaters with the money saved would generate dollars for Americans to buy other goods, thus boosting employment in other industries. Hazlitt concludes that the fallacy of protectionism lies in failing to consider the long-term effects on the whole community.

Hazlitt explains that a tariff does not increase American wages but reduces them in the long run. When consumers pay more for a tariff-protected product, they have less money to buy other goods. Tariffs create an artificial barrier against foreign goods, and American labor, capital, and land are deflected from what they can do more efficiently to what they do less efficiently. This reduces the average productivity of American labor and capital. The tariff reduces the general purchasing power of the consumer&#x27;s income, and whether the net effect of the tariff is to lower wages or raise prices depends on the monetary policies followed. Tariff walls reduce the value of the investment in transport efficiency and create an expense in surmounting tariff obstacles. In summary, tariffs do not benefit all producers but only help the protected producers at the expense of other American producers, especially those with large potential export markets.

Chapter 12, &quot;The Drive for Exports&quot;, explains the inconsistency in the common desire for exports in international trade. The author points out that, logically, imports and exports must equal each other in the long run, and the greater the exports, the greater the imports required to get paid. Additionally, a foreigner&#x27;s purchase of domestic goods requires funds to be available to them, and without imports, there can be no exports. The author argues that foreign exchange is a clearing transaction that cancels out debts and credits, similar to domestic trade, and that discrepancies in balances of imports and exports are often settled by shipments of gold or any other commodity. The author also cautions against the belief that huge loans should be made to foreign countries for the sake of increasing exports, as it would lead to misunderstandings and bad relations later, and a nation cannot grow rich by giving goods away.

Chapter 13, Parity&#x27; Prices&quot;, discusses the argument for &quot;parity&quot; prices is that agriculture is the most basic and important industry that must be preserved at all costs because the prosperity of everybody else depends upon the prosperity of the farmer. This argument is flawed, according to Hazlitt, because there is no sound reason for taking the particular price relationships that prevailed in a particular year or period and regarding them as sacrosanct or necessarily more &quot;normal&quot; than those of any other period. Additionally, if the price relationships between agricultural and industrial products that prevailed from August 1909 to July 1914 ought to be preserved perpetually, then every commodity&#x27;s price relationship at that time should also be preserved perpetually.

Hazlitt discusses what he considers the fallacy that higher prices for farmers will result in increased prosperity and full employment. He argues that while the increase in prices may result in higher purchasing power for farmers, it also leads to a decrease in purchasing power for city workers who have to pay higher prices for agricultural products. Additionally, the policy of increasing prices often involves a forced cut in the production of farm commodities, which leads to a destruction of wealth and less food to be consumed. Hazlitt highlights the fact that the principle of &quot;parity&quot; prices is not a public-spirited economic plan but a device for subsidizing a special interest, as it benefits farmers at the expense of city workers and taxpayers.

Chapter 14, &quot;Saving the X Industry&quot;, discusses the common argument of saving dying industries through subsidies, tariffs, or higher prices. The author argues that while the argument may be justified in some cases, it ignores the negative consequences of such actions, such as reduced efficiency, decreased innovation, and the opportunity cost of diverting resources from more productive industries. He warns that these attempts to save dying industries could lead to decreased competition, higher prices, and a lack of innovation, which ultimately harms the economy as a whole.

Chapter 15, &quot;How the Price System Works&quot;, argues that economic proposals must be analyzed for their long-term and widespread effects, not just their immediate and limited consequences. What Hazlitt considers the fallacy of isolation, or looking at an industry or process in isolation, is the starting point of many economic fallacies. The chapter explains the problem of production and consumption, and how the price system works to allocate resources efficiently in a market economy. It uses the examples of Robinson Crusoe and the Swiss Family Robinson to illustrate how economic decisions are made in relation to all other decisions in a society.

Hazlitt explains how a society solves the problem of alternative applications of labor and capital by using the price system. Prices are determined by supply and demand, and they affect supply and demand. The constant interrelationships of production costs, prices, and profits determine which commodities will be produced and in what quantities. The private enterprise system is made up of machines with their own governors that are interconnected and influence each other. Each departure from the desired speed sets in motion the forces that tend to correct that departure. The relative supply of thousands of different commodities is regulated under the system of competitive private enterprise. When people want more of a commodity, their competitive bidding raises its price, which stimulates producers to increase their production. In the same way, if the demand falls off for some product, its price and the profit in making it go lower, and its production declines. The author also notes that those who criticize the price system do so because they do not understand it, and they look at one industry in isolation without considering the larger picture. An economy in equilibrium can only expand one industry at the expense of other industries, and a shrinkage in one industry releases labor and capital to permit the expansion of other industries.

Chapter 16, Stabilizing&#x27; Commodities&quot;, discusses the concept of stabilizing commodity prices, which attempts to lift the prices of certain commodities permanently above their natural market levels. This practice is generally advocated by pressure groups and bureaucrats who aim to intervene in the market. Their arguments usually state that the commodities are selling below their natural levels and that producers cannot make a living from it, so the government must intervene to prevent scarcity and exorbitant prices in the future.

One of the most common methods proposed to stabilize commodity prices is through government loans to farmers to hold their crops off the market. However, this argument is not supported by theory or experience, as speculators are essential to farmers&#x27; welfare, and they are the ones who take risks to stabilize prices. Farmers and millers can protect themselves through the markets, and the profits of farmers and millers depend mainly on their skill and industry, not on market fluctuations.

When the state steps in and either buys the farmers&#x27; crops or lends them money to hold the crops off the market, it becomes an ever-political granary. The farmers are encouraged, with taxpayers&#x27; money, to withhold their crops excessively, and the politicians or bureaucrats who initiate the policy always place the so-called &quot;fair&quot; price for the farmer&#x27;s product above the price that supply and demand conditions at the time justify. This leads to a falling off in buyers.

Hazlitt discusses how government restrictions on agricultural production, which are intended to raise prices, actually end up harming the overall economy by reducing output, raising costs, and reducing real wages and incomes. Additionally, attempts to control international commodity prices and trade through government planning are likely to result in decreased individual freedoms and living standards for ordinary citizens. The author argues that the best way to ensure an efficient and prosperous economy is to rely on the free forces of the market rather than government intervention.

Chapter 17, &quot;Government Price-Fixing&quot;, discusses the effects of the government&#x27;s attempts to keep the prices of commodities below their natural market levels. The author argues that these attempts lead to an increase in demand and a reduction in supply, causing a shortage of that commodity. This is the opposite of what the government regulators wanted to achieve as the commodities selected for maximum price-fixing are the ones that they want to keep in abundant supply. The author then discusses various devices and controls adopted by the regulators, including rationing, cost-control, subsidies, and universal price-fixing, to avert these consequences.

Hazlitt argues against price-fixing and its consequences, claiming that although price-fixing may seem to work for a while, especially during times of crisis, it will eventually cause demand to exceed supply. The government must then ration more commodities to prevent a black market from developing. This will ultimately lead to a regimented, totalitarian economy with limited liberties. Hazlitt also points out that price control creates a black market, which causes economic and moral harm. New firms that are willing to violate the law take the place of large, established firms. This promotes dishonesty and demoralization. Price-fixing authorities often favor politically powerful groups such as workers and farmers, leading to a decline in living standards. Hazlitt concludes that legal price ceilings do not address the root causes of price increases, which are either a scarcity of goods or a surplus of money.

Chapter 18, &quot;Minimum Wage Laws&quot;, explains the harmful effects of minimum wage laws on the labor market. A minimum wage law can only achieve good in proportion to its modest aims, and the more ambitious the law is, the more likely its harmful effects will exceed its good effects. Hazlitt points out that a wage is a price, and raising the minimum wage above the market value will result in increased unemployment. The only exception is when a group of workers is receiving wages below their market value. Relief programs for unemployment caused by minimum wage laws would create a situation where a man is deprived of self-respect and independence, society of his services, and lowered earnings. Hazlitt suggests unionization as a better alternative to correct low wages in special circumstances or localities where competitive forces do not operate freely.

Chapter 19, &quot;Do Unions Really Raise Wages?&quot;, argues that the power of labor unions to raise wages over the long run and for the whole working population has been enormously exaggerated. Hazlitt contends that wages are basically determined by labor productivity, and it is for this reason that wages in the United States were incomparably higher than wages in England and Germany during the decades when the &quot;labor movement&quot; in the latter two countries was far more advanced. Unions can serve a useful function in assuring that all their members get the true market value of their services, especially when the competition of workers for jobs, and of employers for workers, does not work perfectly. Hazlitt recognizes that individual workers may not know the true market value of their services to an employer, and without the help of a union or knowledge of &quot;union rates,&quot; they may be in a weaker bargaining position. However, unions can go beyond their legitimate functions and embrace short-sighted and anti-social policies when they seek to fix the wages of their members above their real market worth, as such an attempt always leads to unemployment. Hazlitt concludes that unions can become questionable when they use intimidation or violence to enforce their demands, which prevents new workers from taking their place and forces them to take something worse.

Hazlitt argues that an increase in wages is not necessarily gained at the expense of employers&#x27; profits. If a wage increase takes place throughout a whole industry, the industry will most likely increase its prices and pass the wage increase along to consumers, resulting in workers having their real wages reduced by having to pay more for a particular product. While it is possible to conceive of a case in which the profits in a whole industry are reduced without any corresponding reduction in employment, it is not likely. The exploitation of capital by labor can be temporary, and it will come to an end as a result of the forcing of marginal firms out of business entirely, the growth of unemployment, and the forced readjustment of wages and profits to the point where the prospect of normal (or abnormal) profits leads to a resumption of employment and production. Hazlitt concludes that unions, though they may for a time be able to secure an increase in money wages for their members, do not increase real wages in the long run and for the whole body of workers.

Chapter 20, &quot;&#x27;Enough to Buy Back the Product&#x27;&quot;, discusses the concept of &quot;functional prices&quot; and &quot;functional wages&quot;. Functional prices are prices that encourage the largest volume of production and sales, while functional wages are those that tend to bring about the highest volume of employment and the largest payrolls. The concept of functional wages has been perverted by the Marxist and purchasing-power schools who believe that the only wages that will prevent an economic crash are wages that enable labor to &quot;buy back the product it creates.&quot; Hazlitt argues that this theory is flawed as it does not address how much workers need to buy back the product they create, and it can be detrimental to the economy. Hazlitt believes that every increase in hourly wages, unless compensated by an equal increase in hourly productivity, is an increase in costs of production. This increase in costs of production can force marginal producers out of business, leading to a shrinkage in production and growth in unemployment.

Chapter 21, &quot;The Function of Profits&quot;, argues that profits play a vital role in guiding and channeling the factors of production to produce goods that are demanded in the market. If there is no profit in producing a good, it is a sign that the resources being used to produce it are better used elsewhere. The chapter also addresses misconceptions about profits, such as the belief that all businesses make large profits. Finally, it argues that limiting profits can discourage entrepreneurship and reduce efficiency.

Chapter 22, &quot;The Mirage of Inflation&quot;, discusses the erroneous belief that wealth is equivalent to money or gold and silver, which leads to the belief that more money equals more wealth. He also highlights that the belief in the appeal of inflation stems from this confusion. There are different types of inflationists: some naive people believe that printing more money will make everyone richer; some more sophisticated people believe that limited increases in money or credit will fill the alleged gap or deficiency in the purchasing power; and more knowing inflationists believe that an increase in commodity prices will not cause any harm but will improve the position of poor debtors, stimulate exports, and discourage imports. Hazlitt explains that there are numerous theories regarding how increased quantities of money will affect prices, and discusses two groups: one that thinks that the quantity of money could be increased by any amount without affecting prices, and the other that believes that the supply of money will be offered against all goods, and therefore, the value of the total quantity of money multiplied by its &quot;velocity of circulation&quot; must always be equal to the value of the goods offered for sale multiplied by the frequency with which they are sold.

Hazlitt argues that inflation is not a solution to economic problems, as it only creates a mirage of benefits for favored groups, while the costs are borne by the rest of the society. Inflation distorts the structure of production, wastes capital, and eventually leads to economic disaster. Once inflation sets in, it is challenging to control the value of money. Hazlitt points out that each generation and country follows the same illusion, believing that inflation will save them from economic stagnation and bring full employment. However, inflation only changes the relationships of prices and costs, and the effects of this change are short-lived. Hazlitt suggests that reducing wage rates directly could be a more direct and honest way of restoring a workable relationship between prices and costs of production.

Chapter 23, &quot;The Assault on Saving&quot;, argues in favor of saving and against the idea that spending is superior to saving. The author uses the example of two brothers, Alvin and Benjamin, who inherited a sum that gives them an annual income of $50,000. Alvin spends lavishly on luxuries and, in the process, digs into his capital. Benjamin, on the other hand, spends only $25,000 and saves the rest. He also donates $5,000 to charity, which in turn creates as much employment as if he had spent the money directly on himself. The saved $20,000 is either deposited in a bank, which then lends it to businesses, or invested, which helps create new jobs. Hazlitt argues that saving is essential for economic growth and that spending on frivolities and luxuries diverts resources from producing the essentials of life for those who need them.

Hazlitt discusses the positive impact of saving on the economy, highlighting how it leads to an increase in production and productivity. He gives an example of an eleven-year period in which production increases by 2.5 percentage points each year, with a corresponding increase in the consumption of goods. Hazlitt argues that the enemies of saving make false claims that savings and investment are independent variables that need to be expropriated by the government to be used in useless projects to provide employment. Hazlitt counters that savings can only exceed investment by the amount that is hoarded in cash. He concludes that savings lead to an increase in investment and hence more productivity, which eventually leads to economic growth.

Chapter 24, &quot;The Lesson Restated&quot;, emphasizes the importance of recognizing the secondary and general consequences of economic policies. Hazlitt states that economics is a science of tracing consequences and recognizing inevitable implications. He compares it to engineering, where one must determine all the facts and valid deductions to solve a problem. He also suggests that people often fail to recognize the necessary implications of their economic statements. Hazlitt warns that it is essential to consider all sides of the coin before making a proposal and not just the attractive side. He concludes that when studying the effects of various proposals on all groups in the long run, the conclusions that unsophisticated common sense arrives at usually correspond to the correct ones.

Hazlitt discusses the concept of the &quot;Forgotten Man,&quot; originally introduced by William Graham Sumner, and how what Hazlitt considers the fallacy of not considering the unintended consequences of government policies falls disproportionately on him. The author also explains how the division of labor creates a situation where people are incentivized to promote scarcity in the goods and services they supply to increase their income. This is not necessarily harmful when free competition exists, but when groups can collude to eliminate competition, it leads to a situation where a group benefits at the expense of everyone else. The chapter concludes by noting that the same principle applies to changes in demand, which can also lead to winners and losers.

Chapter 25, &quot;A Note on Books&quot;, recommends several books for those interested in further reading on economics. He suggests some intermediate-length works, such as Frederic Benham&#x27;s &quot;Economics&quot; and Raymond T. Bye&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Economics,&quot; as well as older books like Edwin Canaan&#x27;s &quot;Wealth&quot; and John Bates Clark&#x27;s &quot;Essentials of Economic Theory.&quot; Hazlitt also suggests some two-volume works, including Ludwig von Mises&#x27; upcoming treatise on economics and Taussig&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Economics.&quot; Additionally, he recommends reading economic classics in reverse historical order and mentions recent works that discuss current ideologies and developments. Finally, Hazlitt notes that while economics has many specialized fields, a firm grasp of basic economic principles is necessary to understand these fields properly.

==Publication history==
In a paperback edition in 1961, a new chapter was added on rent control, which had not been specifically considered in the first edition apart from government price-fixing in general. A few statistics and illustrative references were brought up to date.

In 1978, a new edition was released. In addition to bringing all illustrations and statistics up to date, an entirely new chapter on rent control replaced the previous one of 1961, and a final new chapter, &quot;The Lesson After Thirty Years,&quot; was added.

In 1996, Laissez Faire Books issued a 50th anniversary edition with an introduction by publisher and presidential candidate Steve Forbes.

The book has been translated into many other languages, such as Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, Korean and Greek. In particular, the Madrid-based Spanish publishing house Unión Editorial, which traditionally publishes books in Spanish language in defense of market economy and liberalism, released &quot;La Economía en una lección&quot; in 1981, 1996 and 2005. A German edition, titled &quot;&quot;, was first released in 1983 by Poller in Stuttgart. In May 2009, it was reprinted by Olzog.

== Reception ==
&quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; made the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list, but quickly fell off since only 3,000 copies were printed. It has since sold over a million copies and is considered a classic by several American conservative, free-market, and libertarian circles. When Ronald Reagan was giving speeches to General Electric plants in the 1950s and 60s, he read &quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; which helped influence his economic philosophy. &quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; was an important work for the development of neoliberalism in America.

Friedrich Hayek praised the work, referring to it as &quot;a brilliant performance...I know of no other modern book from which the intelligent layman can learn so much about the basic truths of economics in so short a time.&quot;

German-American economist Ferdinand A. Hermens wrote: &quot;presidents and cabinet members...could learn a great deal if they would read Hazlitt&#x27;s book and ponder its implications.&quot; French economist Charles Rist referred to the book as a &quot;masterpiece.&quot; The &quot;Peabody Journal of Education&quot; called &quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; &quot;[o]ne of the best books published on practical everyday economic.&quot;

Nobel Prize laureate Milton Friedman stated: &quot;Hazlitt&#x27;s explanation of how a price system works is a true classic: timeless, correct, painlessly instructive.&quot; Bob McTeer, an economist and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, described &quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; as a &quot;wonderful book...If you don&#x27;t have time to read Bastiat&#x27;s collected works, try Hazlitt&#x27;s book.&quot; Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Edwin A. Roberts Jr. wrote: &quot;Fifty years have passed since the book was first published...and it continues to stand as the clearest introduction to what to me is the most engagingly complicated of all academic disciplines. The beauty and strength of Henry Hazlitt&#x27;s &quot;Economics in One Lesson,&quot; of course, is that he uncomplicates the essentials of his subject, and he could do that because he knew vastly more than he put into his book, and he was so facile in his use of language that the writing as well as the content gives pleasure.&quot;

Author Tom Butler-Bowdon included &quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; in his &quot;50 Classics&quot; book series for economics. Philosopher Joseph Heath wrote that &quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; is &quot;a book that is as valuable today as when it was first published in 1946...Hazlitt&#x27;s book should be essential reading for anyone interested in knowing which way is up and which way is down in the world of economics,&quot; though Heath criticized Hazlitt for being overly ideological about free-markets. Law professor and economics writer James Kwak wrote that &quot;Hazlitt&#x27;s portrayal of economics as both easy and powerful was highly seductive.&quot;

In a review in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, the book was described as &quot;a vigorous, skillful, and provocative challenge to sophisticated formulations of theory and policy,&quot; however &quot;the lesson as a whole is too easy, and the &quot;common-sense&quot; answers are really answers only because the basic problems have been oversimplified so much as to divorce them from the complex reality that confronts us today.&quot; A review in the &quot;Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science&quot; agreed with Hazlitt&#x27;s arguments on the need for greater productive efficiency and the effects of deficit spending but believed monopolies were overlooked in the book. Whereas a review in the &quot;Financial Analysts Journal&quot; stated: &quot;[o]ne by one the bulwarks of the New Deal are assailed and found wanting. Though the book is small and the lesson short, the afterthought will be long and prolific.&quot;

Economist J. Bradford DeLong said Hazlitt&#x27;s book well states the classical view of economics but does not properly address arguments made by Keynesians. However, in 1959, Hazlitt published &quot;The Failure of the New Economics&quot;, a detailed, chapter-by-chapter critique of John Maynard Keynes&#x27; arguments.

Ralph S. Brown, a law professor, also stated that Hazlitt effectively articulates the principles of classical economics on matters such as tariffs, one-way foreign trade, parity prices, and purchasing-power theory. However, Brown criticized Hazlitt on his concept of equilibrium, price systems, and depressions. Post-Keynesian economist Abba Lerner calls it &quot;one of the finest attacks on topsy-turvy economics&quot; but says Hazlitt should more seriously &quot;consider the possibility of an economy suffering from unemployment&quot;.

In 1952, the Norwegian edition was translated and published by Kåre Willoch, who later becames the Prime Minister of Norway.

<text>Vasily Ivanovich Chuikov (, ;  – 18 March 1982) was a Soviet military commander and Marshal of the Soviet Union. He is best known for commanding the 62nd Army which saw heavy combat during the Battle of Stalingrad in the Second World War.

Born to a peasant family near Tula, Chuikov earned his living as a factory worker from the age of 12. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, he joined the Red Army and distinguished himself during the Russian Civil War. After graduating from the Frunze Military Academy, Chuikov worked as a military attaché and intelligence officer in China and the Russian Far East. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Chuikov commanded the 4th Army during the Soviet invasion of Poland, and the 9th Army during the Winter War against Finland. In December 1940, he was again appointed military attaché to China in support of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists in the war against Japan.

In March 1942, Chuikov was recalled from China to defend against the German invasion of the Soviet Union. By September, he was assigned command of the 62nd Army in defense of Stalingrad. Tasked with holding the city at all costs, Chuikov adopted keeping the Soviet front-line positions as close to the Germans as physically possible. This served as an effective countermeasure against the Wehrmacht&#x27;s combined-arms tactics, but by mid-November 1942 the Germans had captured most of the city after months of slow advance. In late November Chuikov&#x27;s 62nd Army joined the rest of the Soviet forces in a counter-offensive, which led to the surrender of the German 6th Army in early 1943. After Stalingrad, Chuikov led his forces into Poland during Operation Bagration and the Vistula–Oder Offensive before advancing on Berlin. He personally accepted the unconditional surrender of German forces in Berlin on 2 May 1945.

After the war, Chuikov served as Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (1949–53), commander of the Kiev Military District (1953–60), Chief of the Soviet Armed Forces and Deputy Minister of Defense (1960–64), and head of the Soviet Civil Defense Forces (1961–72). Chuikov was twice awarded the titles Hero of the Soviet Union (1944 and 1945) and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by the United States for his actions during the Battle of Stalingrad. In 1955, he was named a Marshal of the Soviet Union. Following his death in 1982, Chuikov was interred at the Stalingrad memorial at Mamayev Kurgan, which had been the site of heavy fighting.

==Early life==
Born into a peasant family in the village of Serebryanye Prudy in the Tula region south of Moscow, Chuikov was the eighth of 12 children and the fifth of eight sons. At the age of 12, he left school and his family home to earn his living in a factory in Saint Petersburg, turning out spurs for cavalry officers. Chuikov and all his brothers became soldiers and fought in the Russian Civil War.

==Early military career==
During the turmoil of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Chuikov became unemployed. Later the same year, an older brother arranged for Chuikov to be recruited into the Red Guards. The year after, in 1918, he joined the Red Army.

In October 1918, Chuikov saw active service when he was sent to the Southern Front as a deputy company commander to fight against the White Army. In the spring of 1919, he became commander of the 40th Regiment (later renamed the 43rd), part of the 5th Army under Tukhachevsky facing the White Army under Kolchak in Siberia.

Chuikov&#x27;s record of service during the Civil War was distinguished. In the fighting from 1919 to 1920 he received two awards of the Order of the Red Banner for bravery and heroism. He was wounded four times—one, in Poland in 1920, left a fragment in his left arm that could not be operated on. It led to partial paralysis and caused him to lose use of his arm temporarily. Chuikov carried this war wound for the rest of his life, and it eventually led to septicaemia breaking out in 1981, causing a nine-month illness and finally his death.

He left his regiment in 1921 to continue his studies at the Frunze Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1925. On account of his excellent academic performance, Chuikov was invited to stay at the Frunze Military Academy for another year to study Chinese language and history in the Orient Studies Department. In the fall of 1926, Chuikov joined a Soviet diplomatic delegation that toured Harbin, Changchun, Port Arthur, Dalian, Tianjin and Beijing, cities in northeastern and northern China. After completing his studies in the fall of 1927, Chuikov was dispatched to China as a military attaché. Chuikov traveled extensively in southern China and Sichuan, became fluent in Chinese, and gained a deeper understanding of Chinese politics and culture. In 1929, during the China Eastern Railway Incident, Chuikov was forced to leave China after the Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on 13 July. Chuikov was assigned to the newly formed Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army in Khabarovsk and worked on military intelligence, reporting to Vasily Blyukher, the commander of the Far Eastern Army. The Soviet Far Eastern Army defeated the Northeastern Army of Zhang Xueliang, and Chuikov participated in negotiations that restored Soviet control of the China Eastern Railway.

==World War II==
Chuikov commanded the 4th Army in the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. He commanded the 9th Army in the Russo-Finnish War of 1940.
In December 1940, Chuikov was appointed the chief Soviet military representative to the Republic of China and adviser to Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader, in Chongqing. Prior to his departure for China, he was summoned to meet Joseph Stalin and Semyon Timoshenko, who instructed him to ensure that China remain engaged in the war with Japan so Japan could not challenge the Soviet Union in the Far East and allow the Soviet Union to focus on the German threat from the West. Stalin told Chuikov to prioritize support for Nationalists over the Chinese Communists so as to ensure Chinese unity against Japan. Chuikov arrived in China with a large supply of Soviet armaments for the Nationalist Army, including tanks, artillery, fighter and bomber aircraft, and trucks. In January 1941 when the Nationalists attacked the Communists in the Southern Anhui Incident in breach of their nominal alliance, Chuikov was criticized by Mao Zedong for failing to stop Chiang&#x27;s aggression against the Chinese Communists. Chuikov insisted that the Nationalists could not use Soviet weaponry against the Communists, met with Communist leaders Zhou Enlai and Ye Jianying, but in keeping with Stalin&#x27;s directives, continued to support the Nationalist war effort against Japan, even after the signing of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941. In the Second Battle of Changsha in September 1941, he advised Chiang to relieve the Japanese siege on Changsha by attacking the strategic city of Yichang some 400 km to the north, and the strategy succeeded. In March 1942, he was recalled to the USSR, which by then was at war with Germany.

=== Battle of Stalingrad ===
On 11 September 1942, General Chuikov was summoned to South Western Front Headquarters to discuss the defense of Stalingrad. In a meeting with South Western Front Commander Lieutenant General Andrey Yeryomenko and Commissar Nikita Khrushchev, Chuikov was appointed as commander of 62nd Army and charged with the defense of the city of Stalingrad itself, directly on the western bank of the Volga River. Chuikov would later recount this in a 1943 interview:

&quot;… I was told that I was to take command of 62nd Army. My mission: defend Stalingrad.
…After Nikita Sergeyevich told me to go to Stalingrad, he asked me: &quot;What are your thoughts?&quot; Yeryomenko also wanted to know. He&#x27;s known me a long time. Well, what could I say? I said: &quot;I understand my orders just fine, and I&#x27;ll carry them out. I&#x27;ll do what I can. I&#x27;ll either keep them out of Stalingrad or die trying&quot;. There were no more questions after that. They offered me tea, but I declined, got in my car, and drove to Stalingrad.&quot;
Chuikov arrived in Stalingrad on 11 September 1942 and occupied Hill 102.24 where he set up his command post, and immediately set about preparing the defense of Stalingrad proper. The 62nd Army in Stalingrad faced threat of envelopment by fast-moving panzer and motorized infantry elements of German 6th Army. In the north, a German strike-force advanced out of the west via Kalach on the Don to a point located just north of Spartakovka and Rynok, and in the south a second strike-force advanced from out of the west toward the Tsimlyanskaya and Kotelnikovo axes. Along the front from Kuporosnoye and Orlovka to Rynok, General Chuikov defended against a German main thrust advancing from the northwest and directed at both Gumrak Airfield as well also the train station in the center of the town, and a second additional German strike-force advancing from the southwest directed against Olshanka and the grain elevator. General Chuikov enacted Joseph Stalin&#x27;s order no. 227 &quot;not one step back&quot; and immediately stabilized the threatened 62nd Army.

&quot;When I got to army headquarters I was in a vile mood. I only saw three people: comrade Gurov, Chief of Staff Krylov, and Chief of Artillery Pozharsky. Three of my deputies had fled to the east bank. But the main thing was that we had no dependable combat units, and we needed to hold out for three or four days. The divisions had their respective headquarters on the Volga, and we were still forward on this hill. We were in this tunnel alongside the Tsaritsa River, while all the command posts were farther back. This turned out to be the right decision. And then there&#x27;s one thing that went well, if we can use such a word. We immediately began to take the harshest possible actions against cowardice. On the 14th (September) I shot the commander and commissar of one regiment, and a short while later I shot two brigade commanders and their commissars. This caught everyone off guard. We made sure news of this got to the men, especially the officers. If you go down to the Volga, they said, then you&#x27;ll find Army HQ right ahead of you. And so they went back to their places. If I&#x27;d gone across the Volga myself, they&#x27;d have shot me when I got ashore, and they&#x27;d have been right. The needs of the day determine what needs to be done.&quot;


The determination that Chuikov instilled in his men enabled the 62nd Army to defend the city against all odds.

&quot;Stalingrad will decide the fate of the motherland. The men understood this. The men were in such a mood that if they&#x27;d been wounded, even with a broken spine, they had tears in their eyes as they were being taken to the east bank. They&#x27;d say to their comrades who had brought them out: I don&#x27;t want to go. Better to be buried here. They considered it shameful to go wounded to the other bank. This echoed comrade Stalin&#x27;s order.&quot;
Chuikov was concerned about maintaining communications with his troops.

&quot;We moved to another command post closer to where the enemy would be attacking. And we stayed there. We knew that every extra meter of telephone wires increased the risk of our communications being broken. The most criminal, most dangerous thing for a commander, especially a senior commander, is when you lose control and communications. Most of all, we were afraid of losing control of our troops. I may not be able to send one of my commanders any reinforcements, but it&#x27;s enough for me to grab the phone and say the right thing, that&#x27;s all he needs.&quot;
It was at Stalingrad that Chuikov developed the important tactic of &quot;hugging the enemy&quot;, by which Soviet soldiers kept the German army so close to them as to minimize the airpower enjoyed by the Wehrmacht. Chuikov had witnessed firsthand the blitzkrieg tactics the Wehrmacht had used to sweep across the Russian steppe, so he used the Germans&#x27; carpet-bombing of the city to draw panzer units into the rubble and chaos, where their progress was impeded. Here they could be destroyed with Molotov cocktails, antitank rifles, and Soviet artillery operating at close range. This tactic also rendered the Luftwaffe ineffective, since Stuka dive-bombers could not attack Red Army positions without endangering their own forces.

&quot;Our soldiers knew that the closer they were to the enemy, the better. They stopped being afraid of tanks. The infantrymen would get in a trench, ravine, or building, and start shooting the enemy infantry who were advancing behind the tanks. The tanks would move through, and we&#x27;d leave them to our artillery, which was two to three hundred meters back from the front lines and would fire when they came within twenty to fifty meters. And we didn&#x27;t let their infantry through. The Germans would think that this area was already cleared, that it was dead ground. But that dead ground came back to life. And we had our Katyushas and artillery.&quot;
The fierce defense of Stalingrad by the 62nd Army slowed the German advance and forced Axis forces to pull units from the flanks outside the city to reinforce the urban assault. By mid-November, German forces had taken most of the city and pinned Chuikov and the remaining defenders in several small pockets against the Volga River. In interviews in 1943, Chuikov said he was not informed of the Operation Uranus counter-offensive but could sense one was being planned.

&quot;We had sensed that our high command was preparing a major attack, but we didn&#x27;t know where exactly. We had sensed this from the very beginning of November. We were being given less and less help. We&#x27;d been used to talking to people from front HQ every day, but now they&#x27;d all vanished. Khrushchev wasn&#x27;t here, and Yeryomenko came only once...&quot;
On 19 November 1942, Soviet forces launched a massive double pincer attack to the north and south of Stalingrad, exploiting the weakened Axis flanks and encircling the German Sixth Army, part of the Fourth Army and the Romanian Third and Fourth Armies in a vast pocket stretching nearly 80 km from Stalingrad to Kalach-on-Don. On 22 November, Chuikov&#x27;s 62nd Army switched to an offensive posture, counter-attacking to recapture neighborhoods and preventing German forces from leaving the city to fight elsewhere in the pocket. The German Sixth Army surrendered on 31 January 1943.

=== Poland and Germany ===

After the victory at Stalingrad, the 62nd Army was redesignated the Soviet 8th Guards Army. Chuikov then commanded the 8th Guards as part of 1st Belorussian Front and led its advance through Poland. During the Vistula–Oder offensive, the troops of the 8th Guards under Chuikov participated in breaking the enemy&#x27;s defense in depth, and liberated Majdanek concentration camp on the outskirts of the Polish city of Lublin. The 8th Guards liberated the city of Łódź, seized the fortress city of Poznań by storm, seized a bridgehead on the left bank of the Oder River and fought for two months to maintain and expand the bridgehead in the Kustrin area, before
finally heading the Soviet offensive which conquered Berlin while the Western Allied forces were wiping out what was left in Southern and Western Germany in April/May 1945.

Chuikov&#x27;s advance through Poland was characterized by massive advances across difficult terrain [on several occasions, the 8th Guards Army advanced over in a single day]. On 1 May 1945, Chuikov, who commanded his army operating in central Berlin, was the first Allied officer to learn about Adolf Hitler&#x27;s suicide, being informed by General Hans Krebs who had come to Chuikov&#x27;s headquarters under a white flag. Krebs, under orders from Goebbels, sought conditions for surrender more favorable to the Germans, which Chuikov had no authority to grant and so rejected any terms. On 2 May, he accepted the unconditional surrender of Berlin&#x27;s forces from General Helmuth Weidling who had taken command, with the suicide that morning by Gen. Krebs.

Chuikov appeared in the documentary film &quot;Berlin&quot; (1945), directed by Yuli Raizman.

==Later life==
After the war, Chuikov continued to command the 8th Guards Army in Germany, later serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany from 1949 until 1953, when he was made commander of the Kiev Military District. While serving at that post, on 11 March 1955 he was promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union. From 1960 to 1964, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Ground Forces. He also served as the Chief of the Civil Defense from 1961 until his retirement in 1972. From 1961 until his death, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1969, Chuikov led the Soviet delegation attending the funeral of Dwight D. Eisenhower.

He was a major consultant for the design of The Motherland Calls memorial commemorating Stalingrad battle on Mamayev Kurgan, and was buried there after his death on 18 March 1982, at the age of 82. After Chuikov&#x27;s death a piece of paper with handwritten prayer was found among his belongings: &quot;Oh, the One who can turn night into day and earth into a flower garden. Make every difficult thing easy for me. And help me&quot;.

<text>The York River is a river in Renfrew County, Hastings County and Haliburton County in Ontario, Canada. The river is in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin, and flows from the southern extension of Algonquin Provincial Park to the Madawaska River.

The river alternates between fast flowing portions in steep sided gorges to slower movement through post-glacial sand flats. In these are changes in the river course has created ox-bows and abandoned ox-bows that are now ponds and wetlands.

==Course==

The river begins in the southern extension of Algonquin Provincial Park at Yorkend Lake, in geographic Clyde Township in the municipality of Dysart et al, Haliburton County. It flows west out of the park through geographic Eyre Township and Harburn Township, then loops back east into the southernmost part of the park in geographic Bruton Township. It takes in the left tributary North York River just before Branch Lake, turns southeast, passes over the High Falls, and exits the park into Benoir Lake.
It continues east into Baptiste Lake where it enters geographic Herschel Township in the municipality of Hastings Highlands, Hastings County. The river leaves the lake south at the lake&#x27;s southeast tip, controlled by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources-operated Baptiste Lake Dam, enters the town of Bancroft, and passes over the Bancroft Light &amp; Power Generating Station and dam. The river is crossed by Ontario Highway 28 and Ontario Highway 62 in the town centre, then turns east and northeast. It is crossed again by Ontario Highway 28, passes over Egan Chute and Fram Chute at Egan Chutes Provincial Park, and briefly reenters Hastings Highlands at geographic Monteagle Township.

The river continues northeast into geographic Carlow Township in the municipality of Carlow/Mayo, passes over the Conroy Rapids and enters the Conroy Marsh, a provincially significant wetland. As the river flows through the marsh, it first passes into the municipality of Brudenell, Lyndoch and Raglan, Renfrew County, then takes in the right tributary Little Mississippi River. The river then reaches its mouth as a right tributary of the Madawaska River in geographic Radcliffe Township in the municipality of Madawaska Valley, near the community of Mayhews Landing. The Madawska River flows via the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River.

==History==
In the second half of the 19th century, the river was used to transport logs out of the forests surrounding its watershed. Now, parts of this river have been turned into a provincial waterway park as well as a provincial nature reserve (at Egan Chute).

==Popular culture==
Group of Seven artist A. J. Casson painted a number of scenes from this region, including one titled &quot;Conroy Marsh&quot; and several along the York River itself.

<doc id="580806" wikidata="Q336846" url="?curid=580806" title="Desmond Plummer">
<text>Arthur Desmond Herne Plummer, Baron Plummer of St Marylebone, TD, DL, FRSA (25 May 1914 – 2 October 2009) was a British Conservative Party politician in London and the longest serving Leader of the Greater London Council 1967–1973.

==Education and military service==
Plummer went to Hurstpierpoint College and the College of Estate Management. He qualified as a Surveyor but his career was curtailed by World War II where he served with the Royal Engineers leaving with the rank of Major. In 1950 he was awarded the Territorial Decoration for long service in the Territorial Army, and he was a member of the Territorial Army Sports Board from 1953 until 1979.

==Political career==

Plummer was elected to St. Marylebone Borough Council in May 1952 and served as Mayor of the Borough in 1958. He was selected as a Conservative candidate for a byelection to the London County Council in St Marylebone in 1960, and returned unopposed for the safe seat. He was elected to its successor, the Greater London Council, in 1964 for Westminster and the City of London and in 1973 for St Marylebone.

By 1966 Plummer was chosen as Leader of the Opposition in succession to Sir Percy Rugg, just a year before the GLC elections. With Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour Government growing ever more unpopular he won a landslide victory in 1967. One of Plummer&#x27;s first acts was the official opening of the Southbound Blackwall Tunnel, as witnessed by an inscription on its entrance . His GLC pioneered the sale of council housing, and negotiated from the Government the power to run the London Underground and the rest of London Transport in 1969. The Conservatives were re-elected under Plummer in 1970 a few weeks before the general election, although Labour regained control of the Inner London Education Authority. Plummer was the only Leader of the GLC to get a second term. He was knighted in 1971.

However, the second term saw the GLC embark on a highly controversial policy over urban transport. Plummer believed that London&#x27;s streets, constructed before the car, were insufficient to cope with the growing traffic, and proposed to deal with the problem by creating urban Motorways in the &#x27;Motorway Box&#x27;. The GLC would compulsorily purchase homes and construct three separate ring roads. Although previous administrations had built short stretches of motorway, this was the first comprehensive policy. The first stretch to be built was the Westway from Marylebone to Acton, which involved the demolition of thousands of homes and building a large concrete flyover which continues to be the major route into central London from the west. Residents in areas where the new motorways were to go declared their firm opposition, and the Labour opposition pledged to scrap the schemes and instead subsidise public transport. This, combined with the difficulties of Edward Heath&#x27;s Conservative government, led to Plummer and the Conservatives being voted out in 1973.

Plummer had a series of prominent posts within the Conservative Party. He had already been Chairman of his own Association in 1965, and served on the Executive of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations from 1967 to 1976. When defeated, he was appointed Chairman of the Horserace Betting Levy Board in 1974. Plummer resigned the Leadership of the Conservative Group on the GLC that year, to be succeeded by Horace Cutler, and resigned from the Council in 1976.

==Business==
He resumed his business career, becoming a member of Lloyd&#x27;s of London and Chairman of the Portman Building Society. He also took up the job of President of the Political Committee of the Carlton Club, the leading Conservative club, from 1979 to 1984.

==Personal==
Plummer was born in Temple Fortune. In 1941, he married Pat Holloway. They had one child, a daughter. The couple remained together until her death in 1998. 

He was created a life peer on 29 May 1981 as Baron Plummer of St Marylebone in the City of Westminster. Plummer lived in St John&#x27;s Wood later in life, and he continued to work and to attend the House of Lords well into his final years. He was not, as some authors have said, an angler but a supporter of making the Thames clean and took an active interest in the angling clubs on the river.

Plummer died at St John&#x27;s Hospice in London on 2 October 2009, at the age of 95.

<doc id="580812" wikidata="Q1431678" url="?curid=580812" title="Le Tigre">
<text>Le Tigre (, ; French for &quot;The Tiger&quot;) is an American art punk and riot grrrl band formed by Kathleen Hanna (of Bikini Kill), Johanna Fateman and Sadie Benning in 1998 in New York City. Benning left in 2000 and was replaced by JD Samson. They mixed punk&#x27;s directness and politics with playful samples, eclectic pop, and lo-fi electronics. Like with many bands in and from the riot grrrl movement, many of the lyrics addressed feminist themes and ideas. The group also added multimedia and performance art elements to their live shows, which often featured support from like-minded acts such as the Need.

The band released three full-length albums and toured extensively until 2007, when they announced a hiatus due to exhaustion. After a series of brief reunions to work with artists like Christina Aguilera and Pussy Riot, the band reunited in 2023 for a largely sold out tour of Europe and North America. They have been the subject of several controversies, including criticism for their participation in the trans-exclusionary Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival in the early 2000s, and a 2021 copyright infringement lawsuit targeting their most popular song, &quot;Deceptacon&quot; (1999).

==History==

=== 1998–2000: Formation and &quot;Le Tigre&quot; ===
Following the breakup of Bikini Kill in 1998, Kathleen Hanna released a solo album under the pseudonym &quot;Julie Ruin&quot; and moved to New York, where she wanted to perform &quot;Julie Ruin&quot; songs live. Not wanting to perform the material alone, she recruited Johanna Fateman, whom Hanna had known since meeting at a Bikini Kill concert several years prior. Sadie Benning, who had helped Hanna make a music video for the &quot;Julie Ruin&quot; song &quot;Aerobicide&quot;, also joined in order to help with visuals and translating the music into performable material. These performances never happened, and instead resulted in the formation of a new band entirely, Le Tigre.

While Benning was still in Chicago, Hanna and Fateman began sharing cassettes between the three band members, with songs that would eventually become material for Le Tigre. They took their name from one of many hypothetical bands made up by Hanna .

The band signed with Mr. Lady Records, a label founded in San Francisco by Hanna&#x27;s friend Tammy Rae Carland and her then-girlfriend Kaia Wilson. Hanna called the signing &quot;a logical choice&quot; because of the label&#x27;s greater political commitment over their music releases.

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Le Tigre&quot;, was released in October 1999. The band&#x27;s original live performances consisted of Hanna, Fateman and Sadie performing music, along with JD Samson, a roadie they had met in September 1999, who manually operated a slideshow as a visual component to their music, as the band could not afford a projector at the time. 

=== 2000–2004: &quot;From The Desk of Mr. Lady EP&quot; and &quot;Feminist Sweepstakes&quot; ===
In 2000, Benning left the band to focus on filmmaking. As the band was already into a month-long tour, they asked Samson to fill in during live performances. The band had already been considering increasing the involvement of Samson as possibly a backup singer or dancer, so they asked them to become an official member. Hanna remarked that &quot;JD added an undeniable flair and charisma to the live show and took to touring and recording like a fish to water.&quot;

In October 2001, the band released their second album, &quot;Feminist Sweepstakes&quot;.

In 2003, Le Tigre collaborated with Chicks on Speed on their cover of Tom Tom Club&#x27;s &quot;Wordy Rappinghood&quot; from their album &quot;99 Cents&quot; along with other artists such as Miss Kittin, Kevin Blechdom, ADULT.&#x27;s Nicola Kuperus, and Tina Weymouth of Tom Tom Club. The cover became a moderate dance hit in Europe, peaking at number five on the Belgian Dance Chart, and at number sixty-six on the UK Singles Chart.

=== 2004–2007: Major label deal, &quot;This Island&quot; and hiatus ===
In March 2004, Le Tigre signed with Strummer, a subsidiary of major label Universal Records, a move described by Kathleen Hanna as a make-or-break for the band, who were considering breaking up due to exhaustion. In June 2004, Mr. Lady closed down, and the band began reissuing their back catalogue under their own label, Le Tigre Records, with distribution from Touch &amp; Go Records.

They released their debut major-label album, &quot;This Island&quot;, in October 2004. The album was a moderate success, selling over 90,000 copies in the US.

The band entered a &quot;long hiatus&quot; in August 2007, due to the band being burnt out from touring &quot;This Island,&quot; and the band members wanting to &quot;do their own thing&quot;.

=== 2010–present: Brief reunions ===
In 2010, Le Tigre briefly returned from a hiatus to produce Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;My Girls&quot;, from her sixth studio album &quot;Bionic&quot;. The track features Peaches.

Le Tigre members JD Samson and Johanna Fateman collaborated with Russian activist punk rock collective Pussy Riot during a concert organised by &quot;Vice&quot; magazine in 2014, performing Le Tigre&#x27;s “Deceptacon”. Later, in 2015, they reunited with Pussy Riot to record a song and video for Netflix series &quot;House of Cards&quot;.

In September 2016, the band announced they were reuniting just to release a &quot;special song&quot;. On October 19, 2016, Le Tigre released the song, titled &quot;I&#x27;m With Her&quot;, and its accompanying video to voice their support of the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.

In December 2021, the band announced they would be getting together to play at This Ain&#x27;t No Picnic Festival in 2022.

In January 2023, the band announced they would be reuniting for the first tour in eighteen years.

== Controversies ==

=== Involvement in Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival ===
Le Tigre, along with several acts from Mr. Lady, played at the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival in 2001 and 2005. This festival became controversial for its &quot;womyn-born womyn&quot; stance and exclusion of trans women from the festival, leading critics to accuse Mr. Lady and Le Tigre of being transphobic. Several acts from the label, including Le Tigre and The Butchies, received verbal harassment and death threats as a result of playing at the 2001 festival.

In 2014, amid a boycott of the festival led by Equality Michigan, a group of fans dropped a banner that read &quot;Apologise for Michigan&quot; at a Julie Ruin concert at the Mod Club, Toronto, calling for Hanna to apologise for their performances at the festival. JD Samson released a statement in response, announcing a personal boycott of the festival until all self-identified women were included. The festival shut down in 2015. Hanna has not directly addressed their participation in the festival, but in 2018 has said on Twitter that she supports trans rights.

=== Deceptacon copyright lawsuit ===
In October 2021, Hanna and Fateman countersued singer-songwriter Barry Mann, who sent the band cease-and-desist letters after claiming the song &quot;Deceptacon&quot; was infringing the copyright on his song &quot;Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)&quot;. Hanna and Fateman argued that the use of &quot;bomp&quot; was transformative of the song and was also a critique of the messaging in Mann&#x27;s song. They settled the case in November 2021, with the dispute &quot;amicably resolved by a confidential settlement agreement without any public admission of liability&quot;, according to Pitchfork.

<doc id="580813" wikidata="Q2925178" url="?curid=580813" title="Bridgewater Hall">
<text>The Bridgewater Hall is a concert venue in Manchester city centre, England. It cost around £42 million to build in the 1990s, and hosts over 250 performances a year. It is home to the 165-year-old Hallé Orchestra as well as to the Hallé Choir and Hallé Youth Orchestra and it serves as the main concert venue for the BBC Philharmonic. 

The building sits on a bed of 280 springs intended to insulate it from external sound. The hall is named after the Third Duke of Bridgewater who commissioned the eponymous Bridgewater Canal that crosses Manchester, although the hall and waterside frontage is situated on a specially constructed arm of the Rochdale Canal.

==History==
Proposals to replace the concert venue in the Free Trade Hall were made after it was damaged in the Second World War, but the hall, which was home to The Hallé orchestra was repaired and renovated in the 1950s. Despite being a popular venue, the Free Trade Hall, built in the 1850s, had poor acoustics and outdated audience facilities. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, several schemes to replace it were considered but the project became more likely in 1988 after the creation of the Central Manchester Development Corporation.

In the 1990s, land east of Lower Mosley Street and north of Great Bridgewater Street adjacent to the G-Mex exhibition centre (now Manchester Central Convention Complex) which was occupied by a former bus station and car park near the Rochdale Canal was identified as the site for a new hall. A competition inviting architects to present designs for the new concert hall was launched and a proposal by Renton Howard Wood Levin (RHWL) architects was chosen. The development included the construction of a basin on a specially built short arm of the Rochdale Canal and part of the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal, providing a waterfront setting for the hall.

The Bridgewater Hall held its first concert on 11 September 1996 and was officially opened on 4 December by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. The concert hall was one of a number of structures built in the 1990s that symbolised the transition to a new and modern Manchester following de-industrialisation and the 1996 bombing.

The Bridgewater was well received and won a number of awards. In November 1996, only months after opening, the concert hall won the RIBA North West award. In 1998 the hall won the Civic Trust Special Award, which is given to a building which enhanced the appearance of a city centre.

==Structure==


Construction of the hall was a joint venture between Manchester City Council and the Central Manchester Development Corporation who obtained funding from the European Regional Development Fund. The architects were RHWL and the builders were John Laing. The acoustics were designed by Rob Harris of Arup Acoustics; his colleagues at Arup were the building engineers. The Bridgewater Hall can seat 2,341 people over four tiers in the auditorium: the stalls, choir circle, circle, and gallery.

The main auditorium sits on a foundation of earthquake-proof isolation bearings that insulate it from noise and vibration from the adjacent road and Metrolink line. The hall&#x27;s 26,500 tonne superstructure rests on 280 GERB isolation bearings consisting of rows of steel springs between concrete piers. The Bridgewater Hall is the first concert hall built with this technology.

The structure is mostly formed from solid, reinforced concrete, moulded and cast like a vast sculpture. The auditorium has a double-skinned roof with a stainless steel outer shell. The lower part of the hall is built of deep red sandstone from Corsehill Quarry in Annan, the upper walls are clad in aluminium and glass. The interior uses Jura limestone.

===Organ===
Inside the hall, the focal point is a £1.2 million pipe organ, with 5,500 pipes and four manuals, built by Marcussen &amp; Son, which dominates the auditorium, covering the rear wall with wood and burnished metal. At the time of construction, the organ was the largest instrument to be installed in the UK for a century.

===Barbirolli Square===
On the plaza outside is the &quot;Ishinki Touchstone&quot;, a sculpture by Kan Yasuda made of polished Italian Carrara marble which is white streaked with bluish-grey. The stone weighs 18 tonnes and was installed in August 1996. Its £200,000 cost was financed by the Arts Council, Lottery Fund, Manchester Airport and Manchester City Council. To prevent vandalism, the stone is coated with an anti-graffiti solution.

Beside the main entrance is a sculpture of Sir John Barbirolli by Byron Howard (2000).

==Usage==
Since its opening on 11 September 1996, it has been the home of the Hallé Orchestra, the Hallé Choir and the Manchester Boys Choir, and is a regular venue for concerts by the BBC Philharmonic and Manchester Camerata. From September 2002, it has been home to the Hallé Youth Orchestra and Youth Choir, founded for musicians under the age of nineteen who are not in full-time musical education.

As well as concerts, the Bridgewater Hall hosts conferences and events for external parties such as annual presentation evenings. Manchester Metropolitan University has held its graduation ceremony in the hall in July each year since the early 2000s. The Open University also holds one of its Graduate Ceremonies at the hall each year.

<doc id="580815" wikidata="Q28346" url="?curid=580815" title="International Union of Pure and Applied Physics">
<text>The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP; ) is an international non-governmental organization whose mission is to assist in the worldwide development of physics, to foster international cooperation in physics, and to help in the application of physics toward solving problems of concern to humanity. It was established in 1922 and the first General Assembly was held in 1923 in Paris. The Union is domiciled in Geneva, Switzerland.

IUPAP carries out this mission by: sponsoring international meetings; fostering communications and publications; encouraging research and education; fostering the free circulation of scientists; promoting international agreements on the use of symbols, units, nomenclature and standards; and cooperating with other organizations on disciplinary and interdisciplinary problems.

IUPAP is a member of the International Science Council.

IUPAP is the lead organization promoting the adoption of the International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development, a proposal to be considered by the 76th session of the UN General Assembly.

== History==
In 1919 was formed the International Research Council “largely through the representatives of the National Academy of Sciences, Washington, and of the Royal Society, London, to coordinate international efforts in the different branches of sciences, under whose aegis international associations or unions in different branches of science could be formed&quot;.

In accordance with this principle, the 1922 General Assembly of the IRC convened at Brussels and a number of physicists present decided that the formation of a Physics Union was imperative.

Thirteen countries (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Empire of Japan, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States and Union of South Africa) immediately announced their adherence to the new Union.

An Executive committee was formed which undertook to prepare rules, regulations, and activities of the organization. The committee consisted of ten distinguished physicists: W.H. Bragg, M. Brillouin, O.M. Corbino, M. Knudsen, M. Leblanc, R.A. Millikan, H. Nagaoka, E. Van Aubel, and H. Abraham. The committee had Bragg as President, Van Aubel as Vice-President, and Abraham as Secretary. This was the birth of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.

The year 2022 marked the centenary of the IUPAP, organized and run by the physics communities of the world. In this context, the IUPAP sponsored the publication of &quot;Globalizing Physics: One Hundred Years of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics&quot;, edited by Roberto Lalli and Jaume Navarro. This anthology brings together contributions on the history of IUPAP since its foundation.

== Committees and governance ==
The Union is governed by its General Assembly, which meets every three years. The Council is its top executive body, supervising the activities of the nineteen specialized International Commissions and the four Affiliated Commissions – it typically meets once or twice per year. The Union is composed of Members representing identified physics communities. At present 60 Members adhere to IUPAP. The Members are represented by Liaison Committees. Members of the Council and Commissions are elected by the General Assembly, based on nominations received from Liaison Committees and existing Council and Commission members.

The IUPAP specialised Commissions are:

C1. Commission on Policy and Finance

C2. Commission on Symbols, Units, Nomenclature, Atomic Masses &amp; Fundamental Constants

C3. Commission on Statistical Physics

C4. Commission on Astroparticle Physics. The commission was previously known as the Commission on Cosmic Rays.

C5. Commission on Low Temperature Physics

C6. Commission on Biological Physics

C8. Commission on Semiconductors

C9. Commission on Magnetism

C10. Commission on the Structure and Dynamics of Condensed Matter

C11. Commission on Particles and Fields

C12. Commission on Nuclear Physics

C13. Commission on Physics for Development

C14. Commission on Physics Education

C15. Commission on Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics

C16. Commission on Plasma Physics

C17. Commission on Laser Physics and Photonics

C18. Commission on Mathematical Physics

C19. Commission on Astrophysics

C20. Commission on Computational Physics

The Affiliated Commissions are:

AC1. International Commission for Optics

AC2. International Commission on General Relativity and Gravitation

AC3. International Commission for Acoustics

AC4. International Commission on Medical Physics

AC5. International Association of Physics Students

AC6. History and Philosophy of Physics

In addition IUPAP has established a number of Working Groups, among others the International Committee for Future Accelerators (WG1) and Women in Physics (WG5), to provide an overview of important areas of international collaboration in physics.

== Sponsored conferences ==
Each year, IUPAP endorses approximately 30 international conferences and awards grants to the majority of them. Applications for sponsorship can be made via the IUPAP website.

Sponsored conferences fall into four categories:

General Conferences - Type A

These provide a broad overview of an entire field (typically the field of interest to a Commission), and normally occur at two- or three-year intervals, as advances in the field warrant. Attendance in the range of 750–1000 would be anticipated.

Topical Conferences - Type B

These concentrate on broad sub-fields (e.g. nuclear spectroscopy, nuclear reaction mechanisms, heavy ion physics, are possible sub-fields in the field of Nuclear Physics). They would normally be scheduled in the years between the corresponding Type A General conferences. Attendance in the range of 300-600 individuals would be anticipated.

Special Conferences - Type C

These concentrate on much more specialised topics than in the case of Type B Conferences (e.g. angular correlations, lifetime measurements, neutron resonance studies in the field of Nuclear Physics). Attendance in the range of 50-200 would be anticipated.

Workshops in Developing Countries - Type D

These concentrate on meeting the needs of a developing region. Unlike the Type A, B and C conferences, they do not need to be truly international, but should involve neighbouring countries, and they should address the needs of the region. One Type D conference will be approved each year. All applications for Type-D Conferences must be submitted to the Commission on Physics for Development (C13).

== Sponsored awards ==
IUPAP commissions sponsor various awards for scientists. These include:

* The IUPAP Young Scientist Prize, approved and adopted at the 2005 General Assembly for all commissions. The prize was renamed Early Career Scientist Prize at the General Assembly 2021.
* The SUNAMCO Medal, given by the Commission on Symbols, Units, Nomenclature, Atomic Masses and Fundamental Constants (C2) 
* The Boltzmann Medal, awarded by the Commission on Statistical Physics (C3)

== List of IUPAP Presidents ==

The IUPAP President is the head of the Executive Council. IUPAP Presidents are elected by the General Assembly. During the election of the Executive Council, the future President is also elected to the post of President-Designate. Thus in every Executive Council the current President-Designate will succeed the incumbent President.

Below is the list of IUPAP Presidents since its inception in 1922.

== IUPAP reactions to sanctions in science ==
IUPAP, whose mission is to assist in the worldwide development of physics, to foster international cooperation, and to help in the application of physics toward solving problems of concern to humanity, has throughout its history defended the stand that no scientists should be barred from participating in conferences or events on the basis of their nationality or their affiliation. Shortly after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, IUPAP issued a statement against the military offensive, while advocating for continued international scientific cooperation. To alleviate sanctions in science and to promote principles and policies for international scientific collaboration, IUPAP offers physicists, including students, from any country around the world, who feel excluded from academic exchange based exclusively on their affiliation and/or country of origin, to apply to use the IUPAP as their affiliation.

<text>is a Japanese filmmaker.

==Life and career==
Nakata was born in Okayama, Japan. He is most familiar to Western audiences for his work on Japanese horror films such as &quot;Ring&quot; (1998), &quot;Ring 2&quot; (1999) and &quot;Dark Water&quot; (2002). Several of these were remade in English as &quot;The Ring&quot; (2002), &quot;Dark Water&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Ring Two&quot;.

Nakata was scheduled to make his English-language debut with &quot;True Believers&quot;, but later pulled out. He was later offered by DreamWorks to direct the movie &quot;The Ring Two&quot; (2005), which he accepted, making his English-language debut with a sequel to a remake of his own film.

Nakata made his initial breakthrough into film with &quot;Ghost Actress&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; (1996). Although failing to attain any large-scale success, the film was responsible for leading to his directing of &quot;Ring&quot;.

Other Nakata films include &quot;Sleeping Bride&quot; (2000); &quot;Curse, Death &amp; Spirit&quot;; and &quot;Chaos&quot; (2000). He directed the psychological thriller The Incite Mill which premiered on 16 October 2010 in Japan. He has now completed a Japanese ghost story, &quot;Kaidan&quot;. Nakata is currently working on Hearn, which is about the life of Lafcadio Hearn who wrote &quot;Kwaidan&quot;.

He is represented by United Talent Agency. His film &quot;Chatroom&quot;, was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival.

<text>Coláiste Iognáid SJ (), a bilingual secondary school, is located on Sea Road in Galway, Ireland. It was founded in 1645 and has had numerous locations over the years before its current home. The college is a co-educational, non-fee-paying secondary school and one of a number of Jesuit schools in Ireland. There are approximately 600 pupils in the school.

==Organisation==
Coláiste Iognáid is run by a board of management comprising parent, teacher, and Jesuit representatives. It is non-fee-paying, co-educational, and has no school uniforms. Students study there from ages thirteen to eighteen and sit the Junior and Leaving Certificate examinations. Each of the six-year groups is divided into four classes. The four groups are Gaeilge (&quot;Irish Stream&quot;), Xavier, Loyola, and Collins (G, X, L, C). Students are taught in similar ability classes throughout the school. The school is known locally as the &#x27;Jes&#x27;.

In the fourth year (&quot;Transition Year&quot;), all students are reassigned into one of four classes, Brebeuf, Gonzaga, Ricci, or Claver (B, G, R, C). The classes return to the initial four groups in the fifth year for Irish classes only. The reorganisation of the groups for the fourth year is part of the school&#x27;s &quot;Transition Year&quot; programme. While the Transition Year is optional in some Irish schools, it is compulsory in Coláiste Iognáid.

==History==

Since 1620, the Jesuits have, with some involuntary intermissions, been working with and for the people of Galway. In 1645 their first school was founded through the generosity of Edmund Kirwan. While the language of the classroom was Latin, only the Jesuits with a fluent command of Irish were sent on the &quot;Irish Mission&quot;.

The school, which was incorporated into a Jesuit residence in the present Abbeygate Street, continued in Galway through a time of political upheaval and military activity.

In 1859, at the request of the Bishop of Galway, John McEvilly, the Jesuits once more took up residence in the city, this time in Prospect Hill and served in the nearby St. Patrick&#x27;s Church. Within a year they had opened a college near the site of the present Bank of Ireland at 19 Eyre Square. The college&#x27;s present location on Sea Road dates from 1863, when it was built the same year as the Jesuit church next door, St Ignatius Church.

The modern phase of Coláiste Iognáid began in 1929. The local enthusiasm for the language revival efforts of the emerging Republic of Ireland was to be served by a re-invigorated Coláiste Iognáid, which became an Irish-medium School in 1931.

In 1967, in contrast with its foundation of 1620, Coláiste Iognáid became part of the &quot;non-fee-paying&quot; secondary school system. In 1969, with the co-operation of management and staff, coupled with the help of parents, past pupils, and friends of the Jesuits, the present main school building, the Griffin Building, was built.

In 1974, when the school population was increased to provide three-form entry, one co-educational form became the Irish-medium Scoil Gaeilge. Following consultation with staff and Jesuits, the school established the Board of Management in 1980 to take shared responsibility for all aspects of the school – the first agreed board of its kind in Ireland.

In 1982, the school underwent a buildings programme. This produced a new science block (O’Reilly Building), a refurbished classroom block (Andrews Building), a library, and art, computer, and co-educational facilities. The Colombian Hall was refurbished and an indoor sports area was added. Co-education was extended to the whole school in 1984, to become the first fully co-educational secondary school in the city.

The senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh taught at Coláiste Iognáid for a time.

==Education==

Coláíste Íognáíd is a non-fee-paying, co-educational, secondary school, comprising Jesuit and lay staff and catering to a broad spectrum of social and academic intake. The school has a three-form entry. One form offers education through Irish up to Junior Certificate and all three forms offer mixed-ability teaching.

===Curriculum===
In the three-year junior cycle all pupils follow the Junior Certificate syllabus in the core subjects of Irish, English, mathematics, business studies, science, geography, religious studies, history, physical education, SPHE, and CSPE, as well as a choice between German and French along with a further option of either music, home economics, art or technical graphics.
Transition year follows the Junior Certificate and comprises a selection of courses designed within the school and taught as modules. The subjects taken are as follows: accounting, art - design &amp; craft, career guidance, computers, English (in 4 modules - media studies, modern fiction, drama, creative writing), French, Irish, Spanish, Germany, geography, history, home economics, safety, home maintenance, mathematics, hygiene, music, physical education, religious studies, science and social studies.

In the two-year Senior cycle pupils prepare for the Leaving Certificate. In addition to religious education, pupils study Irish, English, maths, French, and a choice of three from chemistry, accountancy, German, art, physics, geography, economics, music, biology, history, business, home economics (social and scientific), and design and communication graphics.

==Sport and extracurricular activities==

Staff, parents, and former pupils undertake extracurricular activities voluntarily. It is expected that each pupil will participate in at least one of the activities provided. As circumstances allow, the school provides the following sports: rowing, Gaelic football, rugby, hockey, soccer, basketball, canoeing, athletics, swimming and mountaineering.

Gaelic football is now very popular in the school. And in 2017, both the Junior Gaelic Football team and the Juvenile team have qualified for their respective Connacht finals. The Junior team played Glenamaddy and the Juvenile team (U-15) played Garbally College.
Pupils also participate in various clubs and cultural activities such as debating (Irish and English), drama, social action, and orchestra. With many of the nearby schools, extra-curricular activities pupils enter city, provincial, and national competitions like Feile Scoil Dramaiochta, Feis Cheoil na hÉireann, Concern and Denny debates, the Young Scientist Competition, golf, and the various blitz, cup, and league fixtures and regattas.

The school also produces a public musical/drama each year which the fifth years perform.

===Basketball===

The Jes has teams participating in regional girls&#x27; competitions at the senior and under-16 level and in boys&#x27; competitions in the under-16, second, and first-year age groups.

===Debating===

The school had a long history of debating and competes both nationally and internationally. As of 2015, it has had the highest tabbing for eight consecutive years. The current society, founded in 2007 by students Leah Colclough and Ciaran Garrett (winner of 2012 ESU John Smith Memorial International Mace), convenes every week and is open to all students. It competes in every major national and many international competitions available to students.

From 2006 to 2016, the society won the Denny Schools&#x27; Debating Connacht Title (now known as the &quot;West of Ireland Debating Championship&quot;) eleven times.

The under-14 and under-16 teams qualified for the knockout round of the Connacht schools cup – both coming through their groups through disqualification.

The senior squad reached the semi-final of the Connacht schools competition in 2014, losing to Summerhill College of Sligo.

===Ultimate frisbee===

The Jes Ultimate Frisbee Society (JUFS) started in 2014. It is a student-organised club. JUFS was the first in NUI Galway&#x27;s Schools Ultimate Frisbee Programme. Both JUFS and the NUIG ultimate frisbee teams train together on a weekly basis. Although the JUFS is a senior-student-only club, a junior team is in the planning.

=== Other sports ===
Unlike other schools in Galway, the Jes had no adjacent playing fields in the early 2000s yet both the under-19 boys and the under 16-girls made it to the All Ireland finals in 2008. In 2009, the under-16 basketball team again made it to the All Irelands. Since the launch of the new building, the school now has playing fields and several other sporting facilities including a basketball court and a gym.

The school also has a mountaineering club.

<text>The Sorbian alphabet is based on the ISO basic Latin alphabet but uses diacritics such as the acute accent and the caron, making it similar to the Czech and Polish alphabets. (This mixture is also found in the Belarusian Latin alphabet.) The standard character encoding for the Sorbian alphabet is ISO 8859-2 (Latin-2).

The alphabet is used for the Sorbian languages, although some letters are used in only one of the two languages (Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian).

==Alphabet table==
An earlier version of the Lower Sorbian alphabet included the use of the letters &quot;b́&quot; (or &quot;b’&quot;), &quot;ṕ&quot; (or &quot;p’&quot;), &quot;ḿ&quot; (or &quot;m’&quot;), &quot;ẃ&quot; (or &quot;w’&quot;) and rarely &quot;f́&quot; (or &quot;f’&quot;) to indicate palatalized labials. These have been replaced by &quot;bj, pj, mj, wj&quot;, and &quot;fj&quot;.

Sorbian orthography also includes two digraphs:

The digraph ch follows h in alphabetical order. These letters are used in foreign words and names:

<text>James Kidd Flemming (April 27, 1868 – February 10, 1927) was a businessman and politician in New Brunswick, Canada.

Flemming was a school teacher and lumberman before entering politics and serving as Provincial Secretary-Treasurer from 1908 to 1911 and Minister of Lands and Mines from 1911 to 1914. He succeeded Douglas Hazen as the Premier of New Brunswick in 1911. In the June 1912 general election, Flemming led his provincial party to the biggest electoral victory in its history. In addition to two independent Conservative seats, the Conservative Party captured 42 of the province&#x27;s 46 seats.

Under Flemming, the French language was used for the first time in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick.

In 1914, Premier Flemming was forced to resign after charges of fundraising irregularities against him were made public by a powerful group of back-room Liberals known as the &quot;Dark Lantern Brigade&quot; led by party organizers Peter Veniot and Edward S. Carter plus lawyer and Federal Member of Parliament, Frank Carvell.

Nevertheless, Flemming remained popular and won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1925 federal election and again in the 1926 election.

He was president and director of the Flemming and Gibson lumber business in Juniper, New Brunswick. His son, Hugh John Flemming took over the business and too entered politics, serving as Premier of New Brunswick from 1952 to 1960.

James Kidd Flemming suffered from poor health for many of his adult years and died in 1927 at age fifty-eight. He and his wife Helena are buried in the family plot at the Methodist Church Cemetery in Woodstock, New Brunswick.

<text>The Mark Steel Solution is a series of scripted radio lectures by Mark Steel made for broadcast on BBC Radio. The show began in 1992. Each episode presents persuasive, yet witty, arguments for a seemingly bizarre solution to a contemporary social problem by highlighting the flaws in the present system. The show&#x27;s original slogan was &quot;Give me thirty minutes and I’ll convince you of anything!&quot;

The first series was broadcast on BBC Radio 5, before three series were broadcast on BBC Radio 4. As of 2024, old episodes are broadcast on Radio 4 Extra. Many of the arguments are illustrated by miniature sketches, featuring Mark Steel, Pete Sinclair, Maria McErlane, and Kim Wall. It was produced by Phil Clark, and was written by Mark Steel and Pete Sinclair.

<text>Sir John Douglas Hazen, (June 5, 1860 – December 27, 1937) was a politician in New Brunswick, Canada.

== Biography ==
Known by his second name, Douglas, he entered politics in 1885 when he was elected as an alderman for Fredericton City Council. He became mayor in 1888.

Hazen was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative candidate in the 1891 federal election. He lost his seat in the 1896 election that defeated the Conservatives and brought Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberals to power.

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 1899, and became leader of the opposition. Hazen rebuilt the Conservative Party which had been out of power since 1883. He led the party into government in the 1908 provincial election.

As premier, Hazen fought political corruption and attempts by the federal government to reduce the Maritime provinces&#x27; representation in the federal House of Commons.

Douglas Hazen left provincial politics in 1911 to become federal Minister of Marine and Fisheries and Minister of the Naval Service in the government of Sir Robert Borden. During the First World War, he served in the Imperial War Cabinet. Hazen left politics in October 1917 to become Chief Justice of New Brunswick.

For his years of service to The Crown and to Canada, in 1918 Douglas Hazen was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George by King George V.

Hazen died in 1937 at age seventy-seven and was interred in the Fernhill Cemetery in Saint John, New Brunswick. Sir Douglas Hazen Park in Oromocto, New Brunswick and Sir Douglas Hazen Hall at the University of New Brunswick, Saint John are named in his honour.

Hazen was the father of King Hazen.

<doc id="580849" wikidata="Q157003" url="?curid=580849" title="Jewish Museum Berlin">
<text>The Jewish Museum Berlin (&quot;Jüdisches Museum Berlin&quot;) was opened in 2001 and is the largest Jewish museum in Europe. On of floor space, the museum presents the history of the Jews in Germany from the Middle Ages to the present day, with new focuses and new scenography. It consists of three buildings, two of which are new additions specifically built for the museum by architect Daniel Libeskind. German-Jewish history is documented in the collections, the library and the archive, and is reflected in the museum&#x27;s program of events.

From its opening in 2001 to December 2017, the museum had over eleven million visitors and is one of the most visited museums in Germany.

Opposite the building ensemble, the W. Michael Blumenthal Academy of the Jewish Museum Berlin was built – also after a design by Libeskind – in 2011/2012 in the former flower market hall. The archives, library, museum education department, a lecture hall and the Diaspora Garden can all be found in the academy.

==History==

The first Jewish Museum in Berlin was founded on 24 January 1933, under the leadership of Karl Schwartz, six days before the Nazis officially gained power. The museum was built next to the Neue Synagoge on Oranienburger Straße and, in addition to curating Jewish history, also featured collections of modern Jewish art. Schwartz intended the museum as a means to revitalise Jewish creativity, and to demonstrate that Jewish history was &quot;living history&quot;. The museum&#x27;s art collection was also seen as a contribution to German art history and one of the last exhibitions to be held was a retrospective of the German impressionist, Ernst Oppler in 1937. To reflect this focus on living history, the entrance hall of the museum both contained busts of prominent German Jews, such as Moses Mendelssohn and Abraham Geiger, and also a number of works by contemporary Jewish artists such as Arnold Zadikow and Lesser Ury.

On 10 November 1938, during the &#x27;November Pogroms&#x27;, known as Kristallnacht, the museum was shut down by the Gestapo, and the museum&#x27;s inventory was confiscated. In 1976 a &quot;Society for a Jewish Museum&quot; formed and, three years later, the Berlin Museum, which chronicled the city&#x27;s history, established a Jewish Department, but already, discussions about constructing a new museum dedicated to Jewish history in Berlin were being held.

In 1988, the Berlin government announced an anonymous competition for the new museum&#x27;s design, with a jury chaired by Josef Paul Kleihues. A year later, Daniel Libeskind&#x27;s design was chosen from among 189 submissions by the committee for what was then planned as a &quot;Jewish Department&quot; for the Berlin Museum. While other entrants proposed cool, neutral spaces, Libeskind offered a radical, zigzag design, which earned the nickname &quot;Blitz&quot; (&quot;Lightning&quot;).

In 1991, Berlin&#x27;s government temporarily canceled the project to finance its bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Six months later the decision was reversed and construction on the $65 million extension to the Berlin Museum began in November 1992. The empty museum was completed in 1999 and attracted over 350,000 people before it was filled and opened on 9 September 2001.

==Design==

The Jewish Museum Berlin is located in what was West Berlin before the fall of the Wall. Essentially, it consists of two buildings – a baroque old building, the &quot;Kollegienhaus&quot; (that formerly housed the Berlin Museum) and a new, deconstructivist-style building by Libeskind. The two buildings have no visible connection above ground. The Libeskind building, consisting of about , is a twisted zig-zag and is accessible only via an underground passage from the old building.

For Libeskind, The new design, which was created a year before the Berlin Wall came down, was based on three conceptions that formed the museum&#x27;s foundation: first, the impossibility of understanding the history of Berlin without understanding the enormous intellectual, economic and cultural contribution made by the Jewish citizens of Berlin, second, the necessity to integrate physically and spiritually the meaning of the Holocaust into the consciousness and memory of the city of Berlin. Third, that only through the acknowledgement and incorporation of this erasure and void of Jewish life in Berlin, can the history of Berlin and Europe have a human future. A line of &quot;Voids&quot;, empty spaces about 66 feet (20 m) tall, slices linearly through the entire building. Such voids represent &quot;That which can never be exhibited when it comes to Jewish Berlin history: Humanity reduced to ashes.&quot;

In the basement, visitors first encounter three intersecting, slanting corridors named the &quot;Axes.&quot; Here a similarity to Libeskind&#x27;s first building – the Felix Nussbaum Haus – is apparent, which is also divided into three areas with different meanings. In Berlin, the three axes symbolize three paths of Jewish life in Germany – continuity in German history, emigration from Germany, and the Holocaust.

The second axis connects the Museum proper to the Garden of Exile, whose foundation is tilted. The Garden&#x27;s oleaster grows out of reach, atop 49 tall pillars (48 filled with Berlin&#x27;s earth, one with earth from Jerusalem). The third axis leads from the Museum to the Holocaust Tower, a tall empty silo. The bare concrete Tower is neither heated nor cooled, and its only light comes from a small slit in its roof. The Jewish Museum Berlin was Libeskind&#x27;s first major international success.

In recent years, Libeskind has designed two structural extensions: a covering made of glass and steel for the &quot;Kollegienhaus&quot; courtyard (2007), and the W. Michael Blumenthal Academy of the Jewish Museum in a rectangular, 1960s flower market hall on the opposite side of the street (2012).

In 2016, a jury appointed by the Jewish Museum Berlin awarded the first prize in an architectural competition for a new €3.44 million children&#x27;s museum for 3 to 12 year-olds to Olson Kundig Architects; the second prize was awarded to the Berlin firm Staab Architekten and third prize to Michael Wallraff of Vienna. The children&#x27;s museum opened on June 27, 2021 and is housed in the W. Michael Blumenthal Academy. 

==Exhibitions==
===Permanent exhibition===
The new core exhibition entitled &quot;Jewish Life in Germany: Past and Present&quot; opened on 23 August 2020. Covering more than 3,500 square meters, it tells the story of Jews in Germany from their beginnings to the present day from a Jewish perspective.

The exhibition is divided into five historical chapters spanning from the beginnings of Jewish life in Ashkenaz, through the emancipation movement, the Enlightenment, and its failure, to the present. The largest space is dedicated to National Socialism and the chapter After 1945, where topics such as restitution and reparation, the relationship to Israel and Russian-speaking immigration from 1990 onwards are the central themes. As a &quot;final chorus,&quot; the video installation &quot;Mesubin&quot; (The Gathered) brings the polyphony of contemporary Jewish together. Eight thematic rooms deal with religious aspects of Judaism and its lived practice, with the museum&#x27;s family collections, and with art and music. What is sacred in Judaism? How is Shabbat celebrated? What is the sound of Judaism? In addition to original objects, the exhibition presents a wide variety of audio-visual media, virtual reality, art and interactive games.

====The previous permanent exhibition====
The previous permanent exhibition &quot;Two Millennia of German Jewish History&quot; was on display from September 2001 to December 2017. It presented Germany through the eyes of the Jewish minority. The exhibition began with displays of medieval settlements along the Rhine, in particular in Speyer, Worms and Mayence. The Baroque period was regarded through the lens of Glikl bas Judah Leib (1646–1724, also known as Glückel von Hameln), who left a diary detailing her life as a Jewish business woman in Hamburg. The intellectual and personal legacies of philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1729–1786) were next; both figures were flanked by depictions of Jews in court and country. The Age of Emancipation in the nineteenth century was presented as a time of optimism, achievement and prosperity, though setbacks and disappointments were displayed as well. German-Jewish soldiers fighting for their country in World War I stood at the beginning of the twentieth century. One focus of the exhibition was Berlin and its development into a European metropolis. The Jews living here as merchants and entrepreneurs, scientists and artists, were pioneers of the modern age.

In the section on National Socialism, emphasis was placed on the ways in which Jews reacted to the increasing discrimination against them, such as founding Jewish schools and social services. After the Shoah, 250 000 survivors waited in &quot;Displaced Persons&quot; camps for the possibility to emigrate. At the same time, small Jewish communities in West and East were forming. Towards the end of the exhibition, two major Nazi trials of the post-war period were examined – the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial (1963–1965) and the Majdanek trial in Düsseldorf (1975–1981). The exhibition tour concluded with an audio installation of people who grew up in Germany reporting on their childhood and youth after 1945. A new chapter of Jewish life in Germany began with them.

===Special exhibitions===
Changing exhibitions present a broad range of themes, eras and genres. Notable exhibitions are: &quot;Welcome to Jerusalem&quot; (2017–2019); &quot;Cherchez la femme&quot; (2017); &quot;Golem&quot; (2016–2017); &quot;Snip it! Stances on Ritual Circumcision&quot; (2014–2015); &quot;A Time for Everything. Rituals Against Forgetting&quot; (2013–2014); &quot;The Whole Truth … everything you always wanted to know about Jews&quot; (2013); &quot;Obsessions&quot; (2012–2013); &quot;How German is it? 30 Artists&#x27; Notion of Home&quot; (2011–2012); &quot;Kosher &amp; Co: On Food and Religion&quot; (2009–2010); &quot;Looting and Restitution: Jewish-Owned Cultural Artifacts from 1933 to the Present&quot; (2008–2009); &quot;Typical!: Clichés about Jews and Others&quot; (2008); &quot;Home and Exile: Jewish Emigration from Germany since 1933&quot; (2006–2007); &quot;Chrismukkah: Stories of Christmas and Hanukkah&quot; (2005–2006); &quot;10+5=God&quot; (2004); and &quot;Counterpoint: The Architecture of Daniel Libeskind&quot; (2003).

==Permanent installations==

Israeli artist Menashe Kadishman created the installation &quot;Shalekhet – Fallen leaves&quot;, 10,000 faces punched out of steel and distributed on the ground of the Memory Void, the only empty or &quot;voided&quot; space of the Libeskind Building that can be entered. Kadishman dedicated his artwork not only to Jews killed during the Shoah, but to all victims of violence and war. Visitors are invited to walk on the faces and listen to the sounds created by the metal sheets, as they clang and rattle against one another. 

===Another art installation===
The &#x27;Gallery of the Missing&#x27; is a project by the artist Via Lewandowsky. It involves three sound installations under the title &#x27;Order of the Missing&#x27; in black mirrored glass showcases (glass bodies) that cannot be seen in the permanent exhibition. They depict destroyed objects of Jewish culture: the Encyclopaedia Judaica, the Jewish hospital in Frankfurt and the sculpture &quot;Großer Kopf&quot; by Otto Freundlich. The shape of the black glass bodies refers to the &quot;voids,&quot; the empty spaces made of concrete in Daniel Libeskind&#x27;s museum architecture. Using infrared headphones, visitors can listen to up to 40 sound recordings with descriptions, explanations and background information, sounds and music for each object presented as they move along the black glass walls.

==Collections and archives==
The Jewish Museum&#x27;s collections date back to the 1970s, when the &quot;Society for a Jewish Museum&quot; formed. The first acquisitions were Jewish ceremonial artworks belonging to the Münster Cantor Zvi Sofer. Soon, fine art, photography and family memorabilia were acquired. The collection is now divided into four areas: ceremonial objects and applied arts, fine arts, photography, and lastly, everyday culture. The museum archive safeguards over 1,500 family bequests, in particular from the eras of the Empire, the First World War, and Nazism. The library comprises 100 000 media on Jewish life in Germany and abroad.
===The Leo Baeck Institute archive===
Since September 2001, there has been a branch of the archive of the New York Leo Baeck Institute at the Jewish Museum. The LBI has its principal office in New York and holds the most comprehensive collection of materials on the history of Jews in Germany, Austria, and other German-speaking areas in Central Europe of the last 300 years – including about one million documents such as local authority records, personal documents, correspondence, a photo archive as well as numerous testimonies from religious, social, cultural, intellectual, political, and economic life. The collection of more than 1,200 memoirs of German-speaking Jews (also and especially from the post-Nazi era) is unique.

==Other facilities==
===Rafael Roth Learning Center===

The Rafael Roth Learning Center was located in the basement of the Jewish Museum Berlin until March 2017. Here, Jewish history was presented in a multimedia and interactive way at 17 computer stations for individual visitors and groups. Under the headings &quot;Things,&quot; &quot;Stories,&quot; and &quot;Faces,&quot; visitors learned about particular highlights of the collection and were able to delve into larger-scale virtual exhibitions – for example, on the life story of Albert Einstein or on Eastern European immigration between 1880 and 1924. Video interviews offered insights into current Jewish life in Germany. The computer game Sansanvis Park was developed especially for children. The facility was named after the Berlin real estate entrepreneur and patron Rafael Roth (1933–2013).

In the course of planning a new permanent exhibition, the Jewish Museum decided not to continue operating the Learning Center with its technical equipment after more than 15 successful years.

=== W. Michael Blumenthal Academy ===
With the opening of the academy in 2012, its programs were added to the previous range of activities. Founding director W. Michael Blumenthal, after whom the academy is named, aimed to establish a Jewish museum that not only presented historical, religious, and social topics at exhibitions, but closely followed and discussed political and social developments from a Jewish angle. The academy programs focus not only on the relationship between the majority population and individual minorities, but also on the interactions and ties between these minorities.

==Management==
===Funding===
The Jewish Museum Berlin Foundation receives an annual grant from the funds of the Federal Government Commissioner for Cultural Affairs and the Media; this covers around three-quarters of its total budget. The remaining funds are raised primarily through donations and ticket sales.

==Controversy==
By 2019, the museum was dubbed the &quot;Anti-Jewish Museum&quot; due to hosting a series of speakers favorable to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. In February 2019, the German government indicated that it would take steps to prevent the museum becoming a platform for BDS. In May 2019 the German Bundestag passed a resolution calling the BDS anti-Semitic. In June 2019, then-director Schäfer used the museum&#x27;s official Twitter account to retweet a call by 240 Jewish and Israeli academics for the German government to not equate BDS with anti-Semitism, to protect freedom of expression and assembly, and to fight anti-Semitism. Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said, &quot;Under these circumstances, one has to think about whether the term &#x27;Jewish&#x27; is still appropriate.&quot; Schäfer resigned a week later &quot;to avoid further damage&quot;. After his resignation he wrote a book on the history of anti-Semitism.

<text>Germany is the eighth-most-visited country in the world, with a total of 407.26 million overnights during 2012. This number includes 68.83 million nights by foreign visitors, the majority of foreign tourists in 2009 coming from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (see table). Additionally, more than 30% of Germans spend their holiday in their own country. According to Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Reports, Germany is ranked 3 out of 136 countries in the 2017 report, and is rated as one of the safest travel destinations worldwide.

In 2012, over 30.4 million international tourists arrived in Germany, bringing over US$38 billion in international tourism receipts to the country. Domestic and international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over EUR43.2 billion to the German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry contributes 4.5% of German GDP and supports 2 million jobs (4.8% of total employment). The ITB Berlin is the world&#x27;s leading tourism trade fair.

According to surveys, the top three reasons for tourists to come to Germany are the German culture, outdoor activities, German holidays and festivities, the countryside and rural areas, and the German cities.

== History ==
The history of tourism in Germany goes back to cities and landscapes being visited for education and recreation. From the late 18th century onwards, cities like Dresden, Munich, Weimar and Berlin were major stops on a European Grand tour.

Spas and Seaside resorts on the North and Baltic Sea (e.g. Rugia and Usedom islands, Heiligendamm, the islands Norderney and Sylt) particularly developed during the 19th and early 20th century, when major train routes were built to connect the seaside spas to urban centers. An extensive bathing and recreation industry materialized in Germany around 1900. At rivers and close to natural landscapes (along the Middle Rhine valley and in Saxon Switzerland for example) many health spas, hotels and recreational facilities were established since the 19th century.

Since the end of World War II tourism has expanded greatly, as many tourists visit Germany to experience a sense of European history and the diverse German landscape. The country features 14 national parks, including the Jasmund National Park, the Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park, the Müritz National Park, the Wadden Sea National Parks, the Harz National Park, the Hainich National Park, the Saxon Switzerland National Park, the Bavarian Forest National Park and the Berchtesgaden National Park. In addition, there are 14 Biosphere Reserves, as well as 98 nature parks.

The countryside has a pastoral aura, while the bigger cities exhibit both a modern and classical feel. Small and medium-sized cities often preserved their historical appearance and have old towns with remarkable architectural heritage – these are called Altstadt in German.

=== Statistics ===


The table below shows the distribution of national and international visitor nights spent in each of the sixteen states of Germany in 2017.

Germany overall had 178.23 million visitor nights in 2017, of which 37.45 million were of foreign guests (21.01 percent). With 94.3 million nights spent in hotels, hostels or clinics, Bavaria has the most visitors. With 18.472 nights per 1.000 inhabitants, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has the highest density of tourists per population (German median: 5.568 nights per 1.000 people).

Most visitors arriving to Germany on short-term basis are from the following countries of nationality:

=== Surveys ===
The official body for tourism in Germany is the German National Tourist Board (GNTB), represented worldwide by National Tourist Offices in 29 countries. Surveys by the GNTB include perceptions and reasons for holidaying in Germany, which are as follows: culture (75%), outdoors/countryside (59%), cities (59%), cleanliness (47%), security (41%), modernity (36%), good hotels (35%), good gastronomy/cuisine (34%), good accessibility (30%), cosmopolitanism/hospitality (27%), good shopping opportunities (21%), exciting nightlife (17%) and good price/performance ratio (10%) (multiple answers were possible).

== Countryside ==

=== Health ===

About 242 million nights, or two-thirds of all nights spent in hotels in Germany, are spent in spa towns. Germany is well known for health tourism, with many of the numerous spa towns having been established at a hot spring, offering convalescence (German: &quot;Kur&quot;) or preventive care by means of mineral water and/or other spa treatment. Spa towns and seaside resorts carry official designations such as Mineral and mud spas (&quot;Mineral- und Moorbäder&quot;), Healthy climate resorts (&quot;Heilklimatische Kurorte&quot;), Kneipp cure resorts (&quot;Kneippkurorte&quot; = water therapy resorts), Seaside resorts (&quot;Seebäder&quot;), Climatic resorts (&quot;Luftkurorte&quot;), and Recreation resorts (&quot;Erholungsorte&quot;). The largest and most well known resorts also have casinos, most notably at Bad Wiessee, Baden-Baden (&quot;Kurhaus&quot;), Wiesbaden (&quot;Kurhaus&quot;), Aachen, Travemünde and Westerland (&quot;Kurhaus&quot;).

=== Regions ===

The most visited tourist regions in Germany are the East Frisian and North Frisian Islands, the Baltic Sea coasts of Holstein, Mecklenburg and Vorpommern, the Rhine Valley, the Bavarian and Black Forest, and the Bavarian Alps.

The table below shows the five most visited rural districts in 2008:

Other popular regions include 
* in the north: Usedom, Holstein Switzerland, the Lüneburg Heath, Harz and Mecklenburg Lake District
* in the west: Teutoburg Forest, Sauerland, Eifel and the Moselle Valley
* in the east: Saxon Switzerland, Thuringian Forest, Ore Mountains and the Elbe Valley
* in the south: Taunus, Spessart, Rhön, Odenwald and Allgäu.

=== Theme routes ===

Since the 1930s, local and regional governments have set up various theme routes, to help visitors get to know a specific region and its cultural or scenic qualities. The table below shows some of the most prominent theme routes. Other popular German theme routes include parts of the European Route of Brick Gothic and European Route of Industrial Heritage, the Harz-Heide Road, Bertha Benz Memorial Route and Bergstrasse. 


=== Winter sport ===

The main winter sport regions in Germany are the Bavarian Alps and Northern Limestone Alps, as well as the Ore Mountains, Harz Mountains, Fichtel Mountains and Bavarian Forest within the Central Uplands. First class winter sport infrastructure is available for alpine skiing and snowboarding, bobsledding and cross-country skiing.

In most regions, winter sports are limited to the winter months November to February. During the Advent season, many German towns and cities host Christmas markets.

== Cities ==
In terms of numbers of overnight stays, travel to the twelve largest cities in Germany more than doubled between 1995 and 2005, the largest increase of any travel destination. This increase mainly arises from growth of cultural tourism, often in conjunction with educational or business travel. Consequently, the provision and supply of more and higher standards of cultural, entertainment, hospitality, gastronomic, and retail services also attract more international guests.

The table below shows the ten most visited cities in Germany in 2012. Other cities and towns with over 1 million nights per year are Rostock, Hannover, Bremen, Cuxhaven, Bonn, Freiburg, Münster, Lübeck, Wiesbaden, Essen and Regensburg.


===Berlin===

Berlin has a yearly total of about 135 million day visitors, which puts it in third place among the most-visited city destinations in the European Union. Berlin had 781 hotels with over 125,000 beds in June 2012. The city recorded 20.8 million overnight hotel stays and 9.1 million hotel guests in 2010. In the first half of 2012, there was an increase of over 10% compared to the same period the year before.

===Munich===
===Hamburg===
In 2007, more than 3,985,105 visitors with 7,402,423 overnight stays visited the city. The tourism sector employs more than 175,000 people full-time and brings in revenue of €9.3 billion, making the tourism industry a major economic force in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. Hamburg has one of the fastest-growing tourism industries in Germany. From 2001 to 2007, the overnight stays in the city increased by 55.2% (Berlin +52.7%, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania +33%).

A typical Hamburg visit includes a tour of the city hall and the grand church St. Michaelis (called the &quot;Michel&quot;), and visiting the old warehouse district (&quot;Speicherstadt&quot;) and the harbour promenade (&quot;Landungsbrücken&quot;). Sightseeing buses connect these points of interest. As Hamburg is one of the world&#x27;s largest harbours many visitors take one of the harbour and/or canal boat tours (&quot;Große Hafenrundfahrt&quot;, &quot;Fleetfahrt&quot;) which start from the &quot;Landungsbrücken&quot;. Major destinations also include museums.

The area of Reeperbahn in the quarter St. Pauli is Europe&#x27;s largest red light district and home of strip clubs, brothels, bars and nightclubs. The Beatles had stints on the Reeperbahn early in their careers. Others prefer the laid-back neighbourhood &quot;Schanze&quot; with its street cafés, or a barbecue on one of the beaches along the river Elbe. Hamburg&#x27;s famous zoo, the Tierpark Hagenbeck, was founded in 1907 by Carl Hagenbeck as the first zoo with moated, barless enclosures.

=== Trade fairs ===
Germany is home to several of the world&#x27;s largest trade fairgrounds, and many of the international exhibitions are considered trend-setters or industry leaders. Thousands of national and international trade fairs, conventions and congresses are held in Germany annually. In 2008, 10.3 million people visited the 150 largest trade fairs alone. More than half of these visitors come from abroad, more than one third from countries outside Europe. The table below shows some of the most visited trade fairs.

<doc id="580852" wikidata="Q929966" url="?curid=580852" title="Mononuclear phagocyte system">
<text>In immunology, the mononuclear phagocyte system or mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) also known as the macrophage system is a part of the immune system that consists of the phagocytic cells located in reticular connective tissue. The cells are primarily monocytes and macrophages, and they accumulate in lymph nodes and the spleen. The Kupffer cells of the liver and tissue histiocytes are also part of the MPS. The mononuclear phagocyte system and the monocyte macrophage system refer to two different entities, often mistakenly understood as one.

&quot;Reticuloendothelial system&quot; is an older term for the mononuclear phagocyte system, but it is used less commonly now, as it is understood that most endothelial cells are not macrophages.

The mononuclear phagocyte system is also a somewhat dated concept trying to combine a broad range of cells, and should be used with caution.

==Cell types and locations==

The spleen is the second largest unit of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The monocyte is formed in the bone marrow and transported by the blood; it migrates into the tissues, where it transforms into a histiocyte or a macrophage.

Macrophages are diffusely scattered in the connective tissue and in liver (Kupffer cells), spleen and lymph nodes (sinus histiocytes), lungs (alveolar macrophages), and central nervous system (microglia). The half-life of blood monocytes is about 1 day, whereas the life span of tissue macrophages is several months or years. The mononuclear phagocyte system is part of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. The mononuclear phagocyte system has an important role in defense against microorganisms, including mycobacteria, fungi, bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Macrophages remove senescent erythrocytes, leukocytes, and megakaryocytes by phagocytosis and digestion.

==Functions==
* Formation of new red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs).
* Destruction of senescent RBCs.
* Formation of plasma proteins.
* Formation of bile pigments.
* Storage of iron. In the liver, Kupffer cells store excess iron from catabolism of heme from the breakdown of red blood cells. In bone marrow and spleen, iron is stored in MPS cells mostly as ferritin; in iron overload states, most of the iron is stored as hemosiderin.
* Clearance of heparin via heparinases.

==Hematopoiesis==
The various cell types of the mononuclear phagocyte system are all part of the myeloid lineage from the CFU-GEMM (precursor of granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes and megakaryocytes).

<doc id="580856" wikidata="Q3497777" url="?curid=580856" title="Steel Battalion">
<text>is a video game created by Capcom for the Xbox console where the player controls a &quot;Vertical Tank&quot;—a bipedal, heavily armed mecha. To control the tank and play the game requires the use of a large controller made specially for &quot;Steel Battalion&quot;. The controller consists of 44 input points, mainly buttons, but also uses two joysticks, a throttle handle, a radio channel dial, five switches, an eject button, and three foot pedals. Only limited quantities were made available. These quickly sold out, making the game a collector&#x27;s piece. It has since been re-released in limited quantities worldwide, with blue controller buttons distinguishing it from the first edition with green buttons.

==Gameplay==
At the beginning of every mission, the player must start up the machine and operating system; this is handled through a series of switches and buttons dedicated to this purpose. If a corner is turned too fast, the machine will tumble over. If the player&#x27;s machine overheats, its operating system must be reset. The game even simulates window wipers in case of mud hits the monitor. If the player does not eject when prompted, the player&#x27;s in-game character will die, and the game will delete its own saved data, prompting the player to start over from the beginning.

Vertical tanks (VTs) are the vehicles piloted in the series. Essentially bipedal walking weapons platforms, VTs are classed by their developmental generation and sub-categorised by their combat role. Primary combat roles are standard combat, assault, support, scout, and fast attack. Vertical tanks are divided into three weight classes: light, medium and heavy. As the player progresses, new generations of VTs become available. This allows a newer, more advanced operating system, startup sequence, and combat functions, as well as a wider cockpit view and layout. New generation VTs also handle better and can provide better firepower than previous generations.

==Development==

&quot;Steel Battalion&quot; was developed by Nude Maker (former Human Entertainment developers) in collaboration with Capcom Production Studio 4. Inaba&#x27;s superiors were skeptical about putting such a game on the market. The number of staff working on the project grew according to the team&#x27;s experience with making new hardware. The earliest build of the game was created for the PlayStation 2. However, when the Xbox became available, the development team switched to it because of the system&#x27;s greater power. Online play was taken out of consideration close to the development&#x27;s start due to being too ambitious. While the game and its special controller received critical acclaim, the project turned little profit.

==Reception==

The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 35 out of 40. It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2002 &quot;Best Graphics (Artistic)&quot; and &quot;Best Game No One Played&quot; awards among Xbox games, but also the publication&#x27;s &quot;Most Disappointing Game on Xbox&quot; prize. 

&quot;Steel Battalion&quot; was the fifth best-selling game during its week of release in Japan at about 15,092 copies. While less popular in the United States, an estimated 25,000 were sold during the initial launch of the game/controller combo. Inaba concluded that the game ultimately broke even in terms of units shipped and units sold.

A reviewer on &quot;IGN&quot; wrote &quot;where &quot;MechAssault&quot; and &quot;&quot; wouldn&#x27;t let us into the cockpit, &quot;Steel Battalion&quot; won&#x27;t let us out&quot; and joked the US$200 cost was for the controller while the game disc was free.
==Sequels==
A sequel called &quot;Steel Battalion: Line of Contact&quot; was released in 2004, and also used the game&#x27;s unique controller. The third installment called &quot;Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor&quot; was released in June 2012. This installment uses the Kinect motion sensor control rather than the original controller.

<doc id="580858" wikidata="Q125566" url="?curid=580858" title="World Year of Physics 2005">
<text>The year 2005 was named the World Year of Physics, also known as Einstein Year, in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein&#x27;s &quot;Miracle Year&quot;, in which he published four landmark papers, and the subsequent advances in the field of physics.

==History==

Physics has been the basis for understanding the physical world and nature as a whole. The applications of physics are the basis for much of today&#x27;s technology. In order to both raise worldwide awareness of physics and celebrate the major advances made in the field, the World Congress of Physical Societies proposed and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics resolved that 2005 should be commemorated as the World Year of Physics. This was subsequently endorsed by UNESCO. 

==Selected celebrations==
The World Year of Physics officially began with a conference held in mid-January in Paris, titled &quot;Physics for Tomorrow&quot;.
* In the United States, the University of Maryland sponsored several activities in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center, including various lecture series and resident programs.
* In Berlin, sixteen large, red &quot;E&quot;&#x27;s have been erected along a section of the famous Unter den Linden boulevard. Called the &quot;Einstein Mile&quot;, the &quot;E&quot;&#x27;s were in place from April to September 2005 and displayed information on the theories and life of Albert Einstein.
* In Egypt, the Library of Alexandria organized the Einstein Symposium.
* San Marino issued a €2 commemorative coin.
* The Kirwitzer Day 2005 in Kadaň, the Czech Republic, was dedicated to Einstein&#x27;s theories.
* The Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, hosted Einstein Fest from September 30 to October 23.
* A &quot;Beyond Einstein World Wide Webcast&quot;, organized by CERN, was held on December 1, 2005.
* Violinist JackLiebeck and Oxford University physics professor Brian Foster created a joint presentation, &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Universe&quot;, for the World Year of Physics, and continued to tour with it in the 2010s.

<text>Finger Eleven is the third studio album by the Canadian rock band Finger Eleven from Burlington, Ontario. The sounds on this album range from grunge and prog-rock to Electric Six-style disco metal. Because of its commercial success, they were welcomed to the SnoCore 2004 tour. &quot;One Thing&quot; became the biggest single from this record, reaching 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was also played consistently on rock radio and MTV. Some of the songs have been featured in various EA games including &quot;Stay in Shadow&quot; (&quot;Burnout 3&quot;) and &quot;Good Times&quot; (&quot;SSX3&quot;). In a similar vein, &quot;Other Light&quot;, &quot;Conversations&quot;, and &quot;Good Times&quot; have all appeared in the GameCube game &quot;1080° Avalanche&quot;.

During the recording of this album, there were rumors of the band breaking up. Finger Eleven then posted a cell-phone number for fans to call at any point, twenty-four hours a day, to talk to anyone in the group.

There was a limited edition version of the CD, which came with a bonus DVD featuring the &quot;Good Times&quot; music video, studio footage, and a live concert video.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Finger Eleven&quot; debuted at #4 on the Canadian Albums Chart, the band&#x27;s highest position on that chart in their history at the time. The album sold 8,300 copies in Canada in its first week. &quot;Finger Eleven&quot; was also the band&#x27;s most successful album yet in the United States, reaching #1 on the Top Heatseekers chart and appearing on the Billboard 200, peaking at #96 in 2004. The album was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in the United States, making it the band&#x27;s first album to receive a certification in the U.S.

<doc id="580862" wikidata="Q4659502" url="?curid=580862" title="A Shropshire Lad">
<text>A Shropshire Lad is a collection of 63 poems by the English poet Alfred Edward Housman, published in 1896. Selling slowly at first, it then rapidly grew in popularity, particularly among young readers. Composers began setting the poems to music less than ten years after their first appearance, and many parodists have satirised Housman&#x27;s themes and poetic style.

==A Shropshire rhapsody==

Housman is said originally to have titled his book &quot;The Poems of Terence Hearsay&quot;, referring to a character there, but changed the title to &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; at the suggestion of a colleague in the British Museum. A friend of his remembered otherwise, however, and claimed that Housman&#x27;s choice of title was always the latter. He had more than a year to think about it, since most of the poems he chose to include in his collection were written in 1895, while he was living at Byron Cottage in Highgate. The book was published the following year, partly at the author&#x27;s expense, after it had already been rejected by one publisher.

At first the book sold slowly; the initial printing of 500 copies, some 160 of which were sent to the United States, did not clear until 1898. Sales revived during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), due in part to the prominence of military themes and of dying young. Its popularity increased thereafter, especially during World War I, when the book accompanied many young men into the trenches but it also benefited from the accessibility that Housman encouraged himself. Initially he declined royalty payments, so as to keep the price down, and also encouraged small, cheap pocket (and even waistcoat pocket) editions. By 1911 sales were at an annual average of 13,500 copies, and by its fiftieth anniversary there had been approaching a hundred UK and US editions.

Housman later repeated the claim made in the final poem of the sequence (LXIII) to have had a young male readership in mind. For W. H. Auden and his generation &quot;no other poet seemed so perfectly to express the sensibility of a male adolescent&quot;; and George Orwell remembered that, among his generation at Eton College in the wake of World War I, &quot;these were the poems which I and my contemporaries used to recite to ourselves, over and over, in a kind of ecstasy&quot;. They responded to Housman&#x27;s lament for the transience of love, idealism and youth in what was in essence a half-imaginary pastoral countryside in a county only visited by him after he had begun writing the poems. &quot;I was born in Worcestershire, not Shropshire, where I have never spent much time,&quot; he admitted later in a letter to Maurice Pollet dated 5 February 1933. &quot;I had a sentimental feeling for Shropshire because its hills were on our Western horizon.&quot; Thus the &quot;blue remembered hills&quot; of his &quot;land of lost content&quot; in Poem XL are mostly a literary construct. Though the names there can be found on the map, their topographical details are admittedly not factual.

Indeed, Housman confessed in his letter to Pollett that &quot;I know Ludlow and Wenlock, but my topographical details – Hughley, Abdon under Clee – are sometimes quite wrong&quot;. He did, however, have one source to guide him, echoes from which are to be found in the poems. This was &quot;Murray&#x27;s Handbook for Shropshire, Cheshire and Lancashire&quot; (originally published in 1870), in which is to be found the jingle with which poem L opens,
Shrewsbury is described in the book as &quot;encircled by the Severn on all sides but the North, and locally termed &#x27;the Island&#x27;&quot;, which Housman condenses to &quot;Islanded in Severn stream&quot; in his poem XXVIII. Murray also mentions that the last fair of the year at Church Stretton is called &#x27;Dead Man&#x27;s Fair&#x27;, the event with which &quot;In midnights of November&quot; begins. Written about the same time as the others, this poem was held over until it was incorporated in &quot;Last Poems&quot; (1922).

In the letter to Pollet already mentioned, Housman pointed out that there was a discontinuity between the Classical scholar who wrote the poems and the &quot;imaginary&quot; Shropshire Lad they portrayed. &quot;No doubt I have been unconsciously influenced by the Greeks and Latins, but [the] chief sources of which I am conscious are Shakespeare&#x27;s songs, the Scottish Border ballads, and Heine.&quot; Yet while it is true that &quot;very little in the book is biographical&quot;, he could not entirely escape his literary formation, as he had already speculated in a letter written three decades previously. &quot;I suppose my classical training has been of some use to me in furnishing good models, and making me fastidious, and telling me what to leave out.&quot; Nevertheless, some have found a sign in the oversimplification that results, not of Terence&#x27;s but of Housman&#x27;s own emotional immaturity.

==Thematic summary==

&quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; contains several repeated themes. It is not a connected narrative; though the &quot;I&quot; of the poems is in two cases named as Terence (VIII, LXII), the &quot;Shropshire Lad&quot; of the title, he is not to be identified with Housman himself. Not all the poems are in the same voice and there are various kinds of dialogue between the speaker and others, including conversations beyond the grave.
The collection begins with an imperial theme by paying tribute to the Shropshire lads who have died as soldiers in the service of The Queen Empress, as her golden jubilee (1887) is celebrated with a beacon bonfire on Clee Hill (I). There is little time for a lad to live and enjoy the spring (II). Death awaits the soldier (III–IV). Maids are not always kind (V–VI) and the farmer also comes to the grave (VII). Some lads murder their brothers and are hanged (VIII–IX). The spring&#x27;s promise of love and renewal may be false (X). The ghost of a lad dead of grief begs the consolation of a last embrace (XI). Unattainable love leaves the lad helpless and lost (XIII–XVI). The playing of a game of cricket or football consoles a broken heart (XVII). But on this dubious sentiment Edith Sitwell commented acidly, &quot;If he means to say that cricket, and cricket alone, has prevented men from committing suicide, then their continuation on this earth seems hardly worthwhile.&quot;

Continuing this theme, the athlete who died young was lucky, for he did not outlive his renown (XIX). The poet exchanges a glance with a marching soldier and wishes him well, thinking they will never cross paths again (XXII). He envies the country lads who die young and do not grow old (XXIII). Seize the day, then, to cultivate friendship (XXIV). A lover may die, and his girl will walk out with another (XXV–XXVII). The hostility of the ancient Saxon and Briton are in his blood, and he owes his life to violence and rape (XXVIII). The storm on Wenlock Edge symbolizes the same turmoil in his soul as the Romans knew at Wroxeter (XXXI). Man is a chance combination of elements – make the most of him while there is time! (XXXII) If he is of no use to those he loves, he will leave, perhaps to enlist as a soldier (XXXIV, XXXV).

One may live in distant exile in London, but without forgetting home and friends (XXXVII, XXXVIII). The wind sighs across England to him from Shropshire, but he will not see the broom flowering gold on Wenlock Edge (XXXVIII–XL). London is full of cold-hearted men who fear and hate one another, but he will make the best of life while he has a living will (XLIII). The suicide is wise, for he prefers to die cleanly rather than harm others and live in shame (XLIV–XLV). These two poems were suggested by a report on the death of a naval cadet in August 1895 who had left behind him a letter mentioning these reasons for taking his own life. Bring no living branches to the grave of such a one, but only what will never flower again (XLVI). A carpenter&#x27;s son once died on the gallows so that other lads might live (XLVII). He was happy before he was born, but he will endure life for a while: the cure for all sorrows will come in time (XLVIII). If crowded and noisy London has its troubles, so do quiet Clun and Knighton, and the only cure for any of them is the grave (L).

Though he is in London, his spirit wanders about his home fields (LII). From the grave the suicide&#x27;s ghost visits the beloved (LIII), a theme apparently derived from a traditional ballad of the unquiet grave type. Those he loved are dead, and other youths eternally re-live his own experiences (LV). Like the lad that becomes a soldier, one can choose to face death young rather than put it off out of cowardice (LVI). Dick is in the graveyard, and Ned is long in jail, when he returns by himself to Ludlow (LVIII). Take your pack and go: death will be a journey into eternal night (LX). It matters not if he sleeps among the suicides, or among those who died well – they were all his friends (LXI). Some mock his melancholy thoughts but he has used them like the poisons sampled by Mithridates and will survive to die old (LXII). Perhaps these poems are not fashionable, but they survive the poet to please other lads like him (LXIII).

==Interpretations==
===Song settings===
The strong combination of emotional feeling, lyricism and folk qualities contributed to the popularity of &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; with composers. All but eight poems in the collection have been set to music, and eleven of them in ten or more settings. Among the latter, &quot;Loveliest of trees, the cherry now&quot; (II) has 47 settings and &quot;When I Was One-and-Twenty&quot; (XIII) has 44.

Several composers wrote song cycles in which the poems, taken out of their sequence in the collection, contrast with each other or combine in a narrative dialogue. In a few cases they wrote more than one work using this material. The earliest, performed in 1904, less than ten years after the collection&#x27;s first appearance, was Arthur Somervell&#x27;s &quot;Song Cycle from A Shropshire Lad&quot; in which ten were set for baritone and piano. There are six songs in Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;On Wenlock Edge&quot; (1909) in settings which include piano and string quartet; there was also an orchestral version in 1924. Later he returned to Housman again for another cycle, a first version of which was performed in 1927 with solo violin accompaniment, but in this only four were taken from &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, along with three from &quot;Last Poems&quot; (1922). The revised work was eventually published in 1954 as &quot;Along the Field: 8 Housman songs&quot;; in the meantime, &quot;The Soldier&quot; (XXII) was dropped and two more added from &quot;Last Poems&quot;.

Among other cycles composed during the period before World War 1 were the four &quot;Songs of A Shropshire Lad&quot; by Graham Peel and the six for voice and piano in &quot;A Shropshire Lad: A Song Cycle&quot; (Op. 22, 1911) by Charles Fonteyn Manney (1872–1951). George Butterworth was particularly drawn to Housman&#x27;s poems, composing within a short period the &quot;Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad&quot; (1911) and &quot;Bredon Hill and Other Songs&quot; (1912) as well as his emotive &quot;Rhapsody, A Shropshire Lad&quot;, first performed in 1913. Butterworth was killed during the war, but towards the end of it Ivor Gurney was working on the songs in his cycle, &quot;Ludlow and Teme&quot; (1919), and later went on to compose the eight poems in &quot;The Western Playland&quot; (1921). Ernest John Moeran was another combatant in the war and afterwards set the four songs in his &quot;Ludlow Town&quot; (1920).

During the immediate postwar period, two other composers made extensive use of the poems in &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. John Ireland included six poems for piano and tenor in &quot;The Land of Lost Content&quot; (1921). His &quot;We&#x27;ll to the woods no more&quot; (1928) includes two poems for voice and piano taken from &quot;Last Poems&quot; and a purely instrumental epilogue titled &quot;Spring will not wait&quot;, which is based on &quot;&#x27;Tis time, I think, by Wenlock town&quot; from &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; (XXXIX). Charles Wilfred Orr, who made 24 Housman settings, united some in cycles of two (1921–1922), seven (1934) and three songs (1940). Lennox Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;5 Housman Songs&quot; (Op.14/3, 1940) also dates from the start of World War II. Another cycle composed since then has been the five in Mervyn Horder&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; (1980).

Composers outside the UK have also set individual poems by Housman. Several were from the US, including Samuel Barber, who set &quot;With rue my heart is laden&quot; (as the second of his &quot;3 Songs&quot;, Op.2, 1928), David Van Vactor, Ned Rorem, and John Woods Duke. Other Americans composed song cycles: Alan Leichtling in &quot;11 songs from A Shropshire Lad&quot;, set for baritone and chamber orchestra (Op. 50, 1969); Robert F. Baksa (b.1938) who set eleven in his &quot;Housman Songs&quot; (1981); and the Canadian Nick Peros who set seven. Outside America, the Polish Henryk Górecki set four songs and Mayme Chanwai (born Hong Kong, 1939) set two. One of the most recent is the Argentinian Juan María Solare&#x27;s arrangement of poem XL for voice and drum, titled &quot;Lost Content&quot; (2004).

===Illustrations===
The first illustrated edition of &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot; was published in 1908, with eight county landscapes by William Hyde. Those did not meet with Housman&#x27;s approval, however: &quot;They were in colour, which always looks vulgar,&quot; he reported. The poet was dead by the time of the 1940 Harrap edition, which carried monochrome woodcuts by Agnes Miller Parker. It proved so popular that frequent reprintings followed and latterly other presses have recycled the illustrations as well. The example of rather traditional woodcuts was also taken up in the US in the Peter Pauper Press edition (Mount Vernon, NY, 1942) with its &#x27;scenic decorations&#x27; by Aldren Watson (1917–2013); that too saw later reprintings. Other American editions have included the Illustrated Editions issue (New York, 1932) with drawings by Elinore Blaisdell (1900–94) and the Heritage Press edition (New York, 1935) with coloured woodcuts by Edward A. Wilson (1886–1970). Single poems from the collection have also been illustrated in a distinctive style by the lithographer Richard Vicary.

===Translations===
Translations of poems from all of Housman&#x27;s collections into Classical Greek and Latin have been made since he first appeared as an author. The earliest was of poem XV in Greek elegiacs, published in the &quot;Classical Review&quot; for 1897. Some thirty more appeared between then and 1969. Included among these were Cyril Asquith&#x27;s &quot;12 Poems from A Shropshire Lad&quot; (Oxford 1929) and those by L. W. de Silva in his &quot;Latin Elegiac Versions&quot; (London 1966).

===Parodies===
The repeated mannerisms, lilting style and generally black humour of Housman&#x27;s collection have made it an easy target for parody. The first to set the fashion was Housman himself in &quot;Terence, this is stupid stuff&quot; (LXII) with its humorously voiced criticism of the effect of his writing and the wry justification of his stance in the tale of Mithridates. He was followed early in the new century by Ezra Pound, whose &quot;Mr Housman&#x27;s Message&quot; appeared in his collection &quot;Canzoni&quot; (1911). A poem of three stanzas, it begins with a glum acknowledgement of mortality:
In the same year Rupert Brooke sent a parody of twelve quatrains to &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; (13 May 1911), written on learning of Housman&#x27;s appointment as Kennedy Professor of Latin at Cambridge University. These began, in imitation of the opening of poem L,
Max Beerbohm joined in the fun a decade later with six lines beginning
written into the 1920 edition of &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. They were followed by Hugh Kingsmill&#x27;s &quot;Two poems after A. E. Housman&quot;. The first of these, beginning 
is frequently quoted still and was described by Housman in a letter dated 19 September 1925 as &quot;the best [parody] I have seen, and indeed the only good one.&quot; The second by Kingsmill keeps equally closely to Housman&#x27;s themes and vocabulary and has the same mix of macabre humour:
Humbert Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;A. E. Housman and a few friends&quot; is almost as often quoted as Kingsmill&#x27;s first parody. Written in 1939, its humour is equally black and critical of Housman&#x27;s typical themes:
&quot;Loveliest of trees, the cherry now&quot; (II) has twice come in for parody. Dorothy Parker returned it to the context of suicide so prevalent in &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, and included it under the title &quot;Cherry White&quot; in her collected poems, &quot;Not So Deep as a Well&quot; (1936):
A new context is also found for Housman&#x27;s celebratory tone as &quot;Loveliest of cheese, the Cheddar now&quot; by Terence Beersay, a pseudonym claimed to conceal &quot;a literary figure of some note&quot; in the preface to an 8-page booklet titled &quot;The Shropshire Lag&quot; (1936).

Kingsley Amis too acknowledges that there is more to Housman&#x27;s writing than the monotonously macabre. His later &quot;A.E.H.&quot; is more of &quot;an admiring imitation, not a parody,&quot; and reproduces the effect of Housman&#x27;s mellifluous rejoicing in nature and skilful versifying:
Another parodic approach is to deal with the subject of one poem in the style of another. This will only work when both are equally well known, as is the case with Louis Untermeyer&#x27;s subversion of heterosexual relations between Shropshire youth in &quot;Georgie, Porgie, pudding and pie fashioned after A.E. Housman&quot;.

==Legacy==

There have been numerous literary references to &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, often with characters in novels or dramas quoting a few lines or even whole poems.
Since Housman&#x27;s ashes were interred at St Laurence Church, Ludlow, it was visited in 1996 by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra to celebrate the centenary of &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. A wall hanging named after the book is now displayed near the south door there. The book&#x27;s centenary was also celebrated by Wood&#x27;s Shropshire Brewery, when they named their bitter after it. In the same year, a pink climbing rose with a strong fragrance, bred by David Austin, was also named after the book.

Later, the collection was commemorated by the short-lived Wrexham &amp; Shropshire railway company (2008–11), which named one of its Class 67 engines &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. After closure, the nameplate was auctioned in 2015.

<text>A trowel is a small hand tool used for digging, applying, smoothing, or moving small amounts of viscous or particulate material. Common varieties include the masonry trowel, garden trowel, and float trowel.

A power trowel is a much larger gasoline or electrically powered walk-behind device with rotating paddles used to finish concrete floors.

==Hand trowel==


Numerous forms of trowel are used in masonry, concrete, and drywall construction, as well as applying adhesives such as those used in tiling and laying synthetic flooring. Masonry trowels are traditionally made of forged carbon steel, but some newer versions are made of cast stainless steel, which has longer wear and is rust-free. These include:

*Bricklayer&#x27;s trowel has an elongated triangular-shaped flat metal blade, used by masons for leveling, spreading, and shaping cement, plaster, and mortar.
*Pointing trowel, a scaled-down version of a bricklayer&#x27;s trowel, for small jobs and repair work.
*Tuck pointing trowel is long and thin, designed for packing mortar between bricks. 
*Float trowel or finishing trowel is usually rectangular, used to smooth, level, or texture the top layer of hardening concrete. A flooring trowel has one rectangular end and one pointed end, made to fit corners. A grout float is used for applying and working grout into gaps in floor and wall tile.
*Gauging trowel has a rounded tip, used to mix measured proportions of the different ingredients for quick set plaster.
*Pool trowel is a flat-bladed tool with rounded ends used to apply coatings to concrete, especially on swimming pool decks.
*Margin trowel is a small rectangular bladed tool used to move, apply, and smooth small amounts of masonry or adhesive material.
*Notched trowel is a rectangular shaped tool with regularly spaced notches along one or more sides used to apply adhesive when adhering tile, or laying synthetic floor surfaces.

Other forms of trowel include:
*Garden trowel, a hand tool with a pointed, scoop-shaped metal blade and wooden, metal, or plastic handle. It is comparable to a spade or shovel, but is generally much smaller, being designed for use with one hand. It is used for breaking up earth, digging small holes, especially for planting and weeding, mixing in fertilizer or other additives, and transferring plants to pots.
*Camping trowel, a hand tool used in the outdoors to securely stake and prop up a tent, channel a small stream of water, level a sleeping surface, dig a cathole for no traces of waste and do many more outdoor survival chores. Camping trowels can sometimes be made of lighter weight materials than gardening trowels to make them easier to carry in a backpack or they can be made of heavier materials for chopping kindling or shoveling soil without having to awkwardly reach or bend over. Camping trowels may incorporate a secondary side ruler to measure ground surface depth; however, the ruler might prematurely become defaced from course soil particulates. Camping trowels sometimes have a front tip and side features, such as a pointed tip and a serrated side edge to easily cut through tree roots or frozen soil. These serrated camping trowels may include a cover guard to protect the user from cut wounds as well as save backpacks from puncture holes and tears. They may also fold-up for added protection and easy storage. Few others allow for items such as toilet paper to be stored upon or inside the handle.[2]
*In archaeology brick or pointing trowels (usually 4&quot; or 5&quot; steel trowels) are used to scratch the strata in an excavation and allow the colors of the soil to be clear, so that the different strata can be identified, processed and excavated. In the United States, there are several preferred brands of pointing trowels, including the Marshalltown trowel; while in the British Isles the WHS 4&quot; pointing trowel is the traditional tool.

<text>Clifford William Robinson (September 1, 1866 – July 27, 1944) was a New Brunswick lawyer, businessman and politician, the 12th premier of New Brunswick.

He was born in Moncton, New Brunswick and was educated in Point de Bute, Saint John and Moncton before attending Mount Allison University. Robinson worked as a bookkeeper from 1886 to 1889 before studying law. He was called to the bar in 1892 and set up practice in Moncton. In 1897 he became both mayor of Moncton and a member of the provincial House of Assembly as a Liberal. He served as Speaker and Provincial Secretary before becoming Premier in 1907. The Liberals had been in power since 1883, however, and voters opted for a change in the 1908 election which brought the Conservatives to power. Robinson continued in the legislature as an opposition MLA.

When the Liberals returned to power in 1917, Robinson became minister without portfolio and then Minister of Lands and Mines in the governments of Walter E. Foster and Peter J. Veniot until 1924 when he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.

Robinson was the main shareholder and, for a time, president for the &quot;Moncton Transcript&quot;. He also helped establish a French language newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Acadien&quot;. He was president or director for a number of businesses in the Moncton area, helped found the Central Trust Company Limited and the Petitcodiac Hydro Development Company and also helped establish Moncton radio station CKCW.

He died in office in Montreal at the age of 77.

<text>Cheek kissing is a ritual or social kissing gesture to indicate friendship, family relationship, perform a greeting, to confer congratulations, to comfort someone, or to show respect.

Cheek kissing is very common in the Middle East, the Mediterranean, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, the Low Countries, the Horn of Africa, Central America and South America. In other countries, including the U.S. and Japan, cheek kissing is common as well at an international meeting between heads of state and First Ladies or members of royal and the Imperial families.

Depending on the local culture, cheek kissing may be considered appropriate among family members as well as friends and acquaintances: a man and a woman, two women, or two men. The last has different degrees of familiarity.

In Eastern Europe, male–female and female–female cheek kissing is a standard greeting among friends, while male–male cheek kisses are less common. Eastern European communist leaders often greeted each other with a socialist fraternal kiss on public and state occasions.

In a cheek kiss, both persons lean forward and either lightly touch cheek with cheek or lip with cheek. Generally the gesture is repeated with the other cheek, or more, alternating cheeks. Depending on country and situation, the number of kisses range from one to four. Hand-shaking or hugging may also take place.

Cheek kissing is used in many cultures with slightly varying meaning and gesture. For example, cheek kissing may or may not be associated with a hug. The appropriate social context for use can vary greatly from one country to the other, though the gesture might look similar.

In cultures and situations where cheek kissing is the social norm, the failure or refusal to give or accept a kiss is commonly taken as an indicator of antipathy between the people, and to dispel such an implication and avoid giving offense may require an explanation, such as the person has a contagious disease such as a cold.

==Europe==

===Southern Europe===

Cheek kissing is a standard greeting throughout Southern Europe between friends or acquaintances, but less common in professional settings. In general, men and women will kiss the opposite sex, and women will kiss women. Men kissing men varies depending on the country and even on the family, in some countries (like Italy) men will kiss men; in others only men of the same family would consider kissing.

Greece is an example of a country where cheek kissing highly depends on the region and the type of event. For example, in most parts of Crete, it is common between a man and a woman who are friends, but is very uncommon between men unless they are very close relatives. In Athens it is commonplace for men to kiss women and women to kiss other women on the cheek when meeting or departing. It is uncommon between strangers of any sex, and it may be considered offensive otherwise. It is standard for children and parents, children and grandparents etc., and in its &quot;formal&quot; form it will be two kisses, one on each cheek. It may be a standard formal form of greeting in special events such as weddings.

However, in Spain, usually, the gender of the kisser doesn&#x27;t matter as long as they are family or very close friends. In Portuguese families men rarely kiss men (except between brothers or father and son); the handshake is the most common salutation between them. However, men kissing is common in Spain as well particularly when congratulating close friends or relatives. Cheek to cheek and the kiss in the air are also very popular. Hugging is common between men and men and women and women; when the other is from the opposite sex, a kiss may be added.
In Italy (especially southern and central Italy) it is common for men to kiss men, especially relatives or friends.

In most Southern European countries, kissing is initiated by leaning to the left side and joining the right cheeks and if there&#x27;s a second kiss, changing to the left cheeks. In some cases (e.g. some parts of Italy) the process is the opposite, you first lean to the right, join the left cheeks and then switch to the right cheeks.

=== Southeastern Europe ===

In the former Yugoslavia, cheek kissing is also very commonplace, with your ethnicity being ascertainable by the number of kisses on each cheek. Typically, Croats and Bosniaks will kiss once on each cheek, for two total kisses, whereas Serbs will kiss once, but three times as a traditional greeting, typically starting at the right cheek. In Serbia and Montenegro, it is also common for men to kiss each other on the cheek three times as a form of greeting, usually for people they have not encountered in a while, or during the celebrations (wedding, birthday, New Year, religious celebrations, etc.).

In Bulgaria cheek kissing is practiced to a far lesser extent compared to ex-Yugoslavia and is usually seen only between very close relatives or sometimes between close female friends. Kissing is usually performed by people of the opposite sex and between two women. Men kissing is rare even between close friends and is usually considered unnatural and awkward. Male relatives are more likely to initiate kissing if there is a significant age gap, such as between uncles and nephews, or if both men are elderly.

In Romania, cheek kissing is commonly used as a greeting between a man and a woman or two women, once on each cheek. Men usually prefer handshakes among themselves, though sometimes close male relatives may also practice cheek kissing.

In Albania, cheek kissing is used as a greeting between the opposite sex and also the same sex. The cheek is kissed from left to right on each cheek. Males usually slightly bump their heads or just touch their cheeks (no kissing) so to masculinize the act. Females practice the usual left to right cheek kissing. Albanian old women often kiss four times, so two times on each cheek.

===Western Europe===


In France, cheek kissing is called &quot;faire la bise&quot;. A popular French joke states that you may recognize the city you are in by counting the number of cheek kisses, as it varies across the country. It is very common, in the southern parts of France, even between males, be they relatives or friends, whereas in the north (Langue-d&#x27;oïl France), it is less usual for two unrelated males to perform ′&quot;la bise&quot;′. (See Kissing traditions#Greetings.) The custom came under scrutiny during the H1N1 epidemic of 2009.

In the Netherlands and Belgium, cheek kissing is a common greeting between relatives and friends (in the Netherlands slightly more so in the south). Generally speaking, women will kiss both women and men, while men will kiss women but refrain from kissing other men, instead preferring to shake hands with strangers. In the Netherlands usually three kisses are exchanged, mostly for birthdays. The same number of kisses is found in Switzerland and Luxembourg. In the Flanders, one kiss is exchanged as a greeting, and three to celebrate (e.g., a birthday). In Wallonia, the custom is usually one or three kisses, and is also common between men who are friends.

In northern European countries such as Sweden and Germany, hugs are preferred to kisses, though also rare. It is customary in many regions to only have kisses between women and women, but not men and women, who tend to shake hands.

Although cheek kissing is not as widely practiced in the United Kingdom or Ireland as in other parts of Europe, it is still common and increasing. Generally, a kiss on one cheek is common, while a kiss on each cheek is also practiced by some depending on relation or reason. It is mostly used as a greeting and/or a farewell, but can also be offered as a congratulation or as a general declaration of friendship or love. Cheek kissing is acceptable between parents and children, family members (though not often two adult males), couples, two female friends or a male friend and a female friend. Cheek kissing between two men who are not a couple is unusual but socially acceptable if both men are happy to take part. Cheek kissing is associated with the middle and upper classes, as they are more influenced by French culture. This behaviour was traditionally seen as a French practice.

==Asia==
===Southeast Asia===
In the Philippines, cheek kissing or &quot;beso&quot; (also &quot;beso-beso&quot;, from the Spanish for &quot;kiss&quot;) is a common greeting. The Philippine cheek kiss is a cheek-to-cheek kiss, not a lips-to-cheek kiss. The cheek kiss is usually made once (right cheek to right cheek), either between two women, or between a woman and a man. Amongst the upper classes, it is a common greeting among adults who are friends, while for the rest of the population, however, the gesture is generally reserved for relatives. Filipinos who are introduced to each other for the first time do not cheek kiss unless they are related.

In certain communities in Indonesia, notably the Manado or Minahasa people, kissing on the cheeks (twice) is normal among relatives, including males. Cheek kissing in Indonesia is commonly known as &quot;cipika-cipiki&quot; which is an acronym for &quot;cium pipi kanan, cium pipi kiri&quot; (kissing right cheek, kissing left cheek)

In parts of Central, South, and East Asia with predominantly Buddhist or Hindu cultures, or in cultures heavily influenced by these two religions, cheek kissing is largely uncommon and may be considered offensive, although its instances are now growing.

===Middle East===

Cheek kissing in the Arab world is relatively common, between friends and relatives. Cheek kissing between males is very common. However, cheek kissing between a male and female is usually considered inappropriate, unless within the same family; e.g. brother and sister, or if they are a married couple. Some exceptions to this are liberal areas within cities in some of the more liberal Arab countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, where cheek kissing is a common greeting between unrelated males and females in most communities. The Lebanese custom has become the norm for non-Lebanese in Lebanese-dominated communities of the Arab diaspora. Normally in Lebanon, the typical number of kisses is three: one on the left cheek, then right, and then left between relatives. In other countries, it is typically two kisses with one on each cheek.

Cheek kissing in Turkey is also widely accepted in greetings. Male to male cheek kissing is considered normal in almost every occasion, but very rarely for men who are introduced for the first time. Some men hit each other&#x27;s head on the side instead of cheek kissing, possibly as an attempt to masculinize the action. Cheek kissing between women is also very common, but it is also very rare for women who are introduced for the first time. A man and a woman could cheek kiss each other for greeting without sexual connotations only if they are good friends or depending on the circle, the setting, and the location like in big cities.

Cheek kissing in Iran is relatively common between friends and family. Cheek kissing between individuals of the same sex is considered normal. However, cheek kissing between male and female in public is considered to be inappropriate, but it may occur among some youth Iranians.
In 2014, Leila Hatami, a famous Iranian actress, kissed the president of Cannes Gilles Jacob on the red carpet. Responses ranged from criticism by the Iranian government to support from Iranian opposition parties. Former president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad kissed the mother of former President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez at his funeral.

==Americas==

===United States and Canada===
In the United States and Canada, the cheek kiss may involve one or both cheeks. According to the March 8, 2004 edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;a single [kiss] is [an] acceptable [greeting] in the United States, but it&#x27;s mostly a big-city phenomenon.&quot; Occasionally, cheek kissing is a romantic gesture.

Cheek kissing of young children by adults of both sexes is perhaps the most common cheek kiss in North America. Typically, it is a short, perfunctory greeting, and is most often done by relatives.

Giving someone a kiss on the cheek is also a common occurrence between loving couples.
Cheek kissing between adults, when it occurs at all, is most often done between two people who know each other well, such as between relatives or close friends. In this case, a short hug (generally only upper-body contact) or handshake may accompany the kiss. Likewise, hugs are common but not required. A hug alone may also suffice in both of these situations, and is much more common. Particularly in the southeastern United States (Southern), elderly women may be cheek kissed by younger men as a gesture of affection and respect.

In Quebec, cheek kissing is referred to in the vernacular (Québécois) as &quot;un bec&quot; (&quot;&quot;donner un bec&quot;) or &quot;la bise&quot; (&quot;faire la bise&quot;). Whether francophone or other, people of the opposite sex often kiss once on each cheek. Cheek kissing between women is also very common, although men will often refrain. Two people introduced by a mutual friend may also give each other &quot;un bec&quot;.

Immigrant groups tend to have their own norms for cheek kissing, usually carried over from their native country. In Miami, Florida, an area heavily influenced by Latin American and European immigrants, kissing hello on the cheek is the social norm.

===Latin America===

In Latin America, cheek kissing is a universal form of greeting between a man and a woman or two women. In some countries, such as Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, men will kiss on the cheek as a greeting.

It is not necessary to know a person well or be intimate with them to kiss them on the cheek. When introduced to someone new by a mutual acquaintance in social settings, it is customary to greet him or her with a cheek kiss if the person being introduced to them is a member of the opposite sex or if a woman is introduced to another woman. If the person is a complete stranger, i.e. self-introductions, no kissing is done. A cheek kiss may be accompanied by a hug or another sign of physical affection. In business settings, the cheek kiss is not always standard upon introduction, but once a relationship is established, it is common practice.

As with other regions, cheek kissing may be lips-to-cheek or cheek-to-cheek with a kiss in the air, the latter being more common.

As in Southern Europe, in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay men kissing men is common but it varies depending on the region, occasion and even on the family. In Argentina and Uruguay it is common (almost standard) between male friends to kiss &quot;a la italiana&quot;&quot;, e.g. football players kiss each other to congratulate or to greet. In Chile, one cheek kiss is given between male friends (specially young men) and male relatives (despite age and relationship), although sometimes it can be between acquaintances.

In Ecuador it is normal that two male family members greet with a kiss, especially between father and son or grandfather and grandson.

==Africa==
Cheek kissing is common in the Horn of Africa, which includes Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia, and is also present in countries within the Arab world such as Tunisia and Morocco, but is largely uncommon in most areas south of the Sahara. In South Africa, cheek kisses are usually found among male and female friends, with handshakes or hugs usually being preferable among other people.

==Oceania==
In Australia and New Zealand, cheek kissing is usually present among close friends, with handshakes or hugs usually being preferable. In New Zealand, Māori people may also traditionally use the hongi for greetings.

<text>Tonkinese is a domestic cat breed produced by crossbreeding between the Siamese and Burmese. Members of the breed are distinguished by a pointed coat pattern in a variety of colors. In addition to the modified coat colors of the &quot;mink&quot; pattern, which is a dilution of the point color, the breed is now being shown in the foundation-like Siamese and Burmese colors: pointed with white and solid overall (sepia). 

The best known variety is the short-haired Tonkinese, but there is a semi-longhaired (sometimes called Tibetan) which tends to be more popular in Europe, mainly in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France.

==History==
===Origin===
The modern Tonkinese breed is a reconstruction of a breed brought to the West in the 19th century. These cats were originally known as &#x27;chocolate Siamese&#x27;. Breeders working with imported cats from Malaysia noticed some cats have aquamarine eyes and darker coats than the Siamese. In 1901 the Siamese Cat Club recognised them as a Siamese of the &#x27;chocolate&#x27; type.

Many of the cats used to found the Siamese and Burmese in the West are believed to be Tonkinese, including Wong Mau. Tonkinese would be bred still but registered as either Burmese or Siamese, it was not until the 1950s that breeders would take interest in the cat. These breeders worked together on developing breeding lines with these cats and by 1965 the Tonkinese was recognised in Canada as a distinct breed — whence the name originated.

More modern Tonkinese cats are the result of the crossbreeding programs of two breeders working independently of each other. Margaret Conroy, of Canada, and Jane Barletta, of the United States, crossed the Siamese and Burmese breeds, with the aim of creating the ideal combination of both parent breeds&#x27; distinctive appearance and lively personalities. The cats thus produced were moved from crossbreed classification to an established breed in 2001. The name is a reference to the Tonkin region of Indochina, though it is suggestive only, as the cats have no connection with the area. 

In the West, Tonkinese cats under the age of sixth months have historically been referred to as &quot;small-cats&quot; rather than &quot;kittens&quot; to reflect a more direct translation from Burmese, although this term has become almost obsolete since the mid-20th century.

===Breed recognition===
The breed received championship status with the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association in 1984. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) recognised the breed in 1991. Today the breed is recognised in most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Africa. Over 30 countries have Tonkinese cats featured on postage stamps.

==Description==

===Appearance===
Tonkinese are a medium-sized cat, considered an intermediate type between the slender, long-bodied modern Siamese and European Burmese and the more &quot;cobby&quot;, or substantially-built American Burmese. Like their Burmese ancestors, they are deceptively muscular and typically seem much heavier than expected when picked up. Tail and legs are slim but proportionate to the body, with distinctive oval paws. They have a gently rounded, slightly wedge-shaped head and blunted muzzle, with moderately almond-shaped eyes and ears set towards the outside of their head. The American style is a rounder but sculpted head with a shorter body and sturdier appearance to reflect the old-fashioned Siamese and rounded Burmese from which it was originally bred in the United States. While many American breeders avoided using the extreme &quot;contemporary&quot; Burmese in favor of the more moderate &quot;traditional&quot; Burmese, the original Tonkinese breed standard was based on the extreme spherical style of the Burmese descended from Wong Mau.

===Coat and color===
The Tonkinese comes in the several colours listed below.

* Black (also referred to as “brown”, “seal”, or “natural” by different fanciers or organizations)
* Blue
* Chocolate (also called “champagne”)
* Lilac (also called “platinum”)
* Cinnamon
* Fawn
* Red
* Cream
* Additional dilute modifiers (including “caramel”, “apricot”)

Each color also has three variations of colorpoint coat pattern:

* &quot;point&quot;, the classic Siamese-style dark face, ears, legs and tail on a contrasting white or cream base, and blue eyes;
* &quot;solid&quot; or &quot;sepia&quot;, similar to the Burmese, in which the color is essentially uniform over the body with only faintly visible points and golden-amber or green eyes; and
* &quot;mink&quot;, a unique intermediate between the other two, in which the base is a lighter shade but still harmonious with the point color, and the eyes are a lighter blue-green, called aquamarine. They can be anywhere on the entire blue-green to green-blue spectrum.

Additionally, all colors can present in the tortoiseshell or tabby patterns.

==== Color and pattern recognition ====
Depending on the cat registry, not all colors and patterns are allowed for the Tonkinese cat breed. Tonkineses are currently officially recognized by the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) and World Cat Federation (WCF) in only four base colors: black (brown, seal, natural), blue, chocolate (champagne), and lilac (platinum). All four base colors are allowed in the three colorpoint patterns. The GCCF accepts brown, blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, and fawn, red, cream, plus caramel and apricot. These colors are allowed in the tortoiseshell and tabby patterns, and additionally the three colorpoint patterns. Similar to the GCCF, The International Cat Association (TICA) accepts all of the genetically possible colors and patterns.

===Temperament===
Like both parent breeds, Tonkinese are active, vocal and generally people-oriented cats, playful and interested in everything going on around them; however, this also means they are easily susceptible to becoming lonesome or bored. Their voice is similar in tone to the Burmese, persistent but softer and sweeter than the Siamese, similar to the gentle quacking of a duck. Like Burmese, Tonkinese are reputed to sometimes engage in such dog-like behaviors as fetching, and to enjoy jumping to great heights.

==Health==
In a 2012 review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Tonkinese was significantly under-represented, with only one of the recorded cases belonging to the breed against a population of 365.

==Genetics==
Tonkin is a crossbreed type, with coat color and pattern wholly dependent on whether individuals carry the Siamese or Burmese gene. Breeding two mink Tonkinese cats does not usually yield a full litter of mink kittens, as this intermediate pattern is the result of having one gene for the Burmese solid pattern and one for the Siamese pointed pattern.

Colors and patterns in any litter depend both on statistical chance and the color genetics and patterns of the parents. Breeding between two mink-patterned cats will, on average, produce half mink kittens and one quarter each pointed and sepia kittens. A pointed and a sepia bred together will always produce all mink patterned kittens. A pointed bred to a mink will produce half pointed and half mink kittens, and a sepia bred to a mink will produce half sepia and half mink kittens.

<text>The Nivkh, or Gilyak (also Nivkhs or Nivkhi, or Gilyaks; ethnonym: Нивхгу, &quot;Nʼivxgu&quot; (Amur) or Ниғвңгун, &quot;Nʼiɣvŋgun&quot; (E. Sakhalin) &quot;the people&quot;), are an Indigenous ethnic group inhabiting the northern half of Sakhalin Island and the lower Amur River and coast on the adjacent Russian mainland. Historically, they may have inhabited parts of Manchuria.

Nivkh were traditionally fishermen, hunters, and dog breeders. They were semi-nomadic, living near the coasts in the summer and wintering inland along streams and rivers to catch salmon. The land the Nivkh inhabit is characterized as taiga forest with cold snow-laden winters and mild summers with sparse tree cover. The Nivkh are believed to be the original inhabitants of the region, and to derive from a proposed Neolithic people that migrated from the Transbaikal region during the Late Pleistocene.

The Nivkh had long maintained trade and cultural relations with neighboring China and Japan. Previously within Qing China&#x27;s sphere of influence, the Russian Empire annexed the region following two treaties in 1858 and 1860. Subsequently, traditional Nivkh lifestyle was significantly altered by colonization and collectivization. Today, the Nivkh live in Russian-style housing and with the overfishing and pollution of the streams and seas, they have adopted many foods from Russian cuisine. The Nivkh practice shamanism, which is important for the winter Bear Festival, though some have converted to Russian Orthodoxy.

The population of Nivkhs according to successive censuses is a decrease is evident. Most speak Russian today, while less than 5 percent speak their native Nivkh language. Nivkh is considered a language isolate or small family, although it is grouped for convenience with the Paleosiberian languages. Nivkh is divided into four dialects or languages.

==Etymology==
&quot;Nivkh&quot; (plural &quot;Nivkhgu&quot; in the Nivkh language), an endonym, means &quot;person&quot; in the Nivkh language. They may also be referred to as Nivkhi in 1920s Western literature, due to the romanization of the Russian term plural &quot; from &quot; (&quot;nivkh&quot;). In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Russian explorers first termed the group &quot;Gilyak&quot; (also &quot;Giliaks&quot; or &quot;Giliatski&quot;). The etymology of the name &quot;Gilyak&quot; is disputed by linguists, with some believing the name originated from an exonym given to the Nivkhs by a nearby Tungusic group. Other scholars believe that &quot;Gilyak&quot; derives from &quot;Kile&quot;, another nearby Tungusic group that the Russians had mistakenly named Nivkhs. &quot;Gilyak&quot; is the Russian rendering of terms derived from the Tungusic &quot;Gileke&quot; and Manchu-Chinese &quot;Gilemi&quot; (Gilimi, Gilyami) for culturally similar peoples of the Amur River region, and was applied principally to the Nivkh in Western literature.

==Origins==
The origins of the Nivkh are hard to discern from current archaeological research. Their subsistence by fishing and coastal sea-mammal hunting is very similar to the Koryak and Itelmen on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The rigging of dog-sledges is also similar to these Chukotko-Kamchatkan groups. Spiritual beliefs are similar to those of the Northwest Coast Indians of North America, whose ancestors migrated from this area. The Nivkh are physically and genetically different from the surrounding peoples, and scholars believe they are the Indigenous inhabitants of the area. The current archaeological model suggests that a sub-Arctic microlithic culture originating from the Transbaikal region migrated across Siberia and populated the Amur and Sakhalin region during the Late Pleistocene, or perhaps earlier. Scientists believe that people of this culture were the first to migrate eastward into the Americas.

The microlithic culture was technologically adept in the harsh climate of Siberia during the last ice age. After the ice receded, Tungusic peoples from the south pressed into the warmer northern areas, soon dominating the settled peoples. The Nivkh are considered the last surviving ethnic group able to adapt to the warmer climate and not be assimilated or squeezed out by the newcomers, hence the Nivkh isolate language. The earliest archeological radiocarbon dating for Northern Sakhalin as of 2004 is the Neolithic Age &quot;Imchin Site 2&quot;, dated to 4950–4570 BCE near the Tym&#x27; River estuary on the west coast.

Michael Fortescue suggests that Nivkh might be related to the Mosan languages of North America (however, Mosan is generally considered a &quot;Sprachbund&quot; rather than a language family). Fortescue also presents evidence that Nivkh is related to the Chukotko-Kamchatkans, forming a Chukotko-Kamchatkan–Amuric family, though the evidence was judged to be &quot;insufficient&quot; by &quot;Glottolog&quot;.

More recently, Sergei Nikolaev argued in two papers for a systematic relationship between Nivkh and the Algic languages of North America and a more distant relationship between these two together and the Wakashan languages of coastal British Columbia.

==History==

===Pre-modern history===
The Sakhalin Nivkhs populated the island during the Late Pleistocene period, when the island was connected to the Continent of Asia via the exposed Strait of Tartary. When the ice age receded, the oceans rose and the Nivkh were split into two groups. It is suggested that the Nivkh people were present in a wide area of Northeast Asia and influenced other people and their cultures. Nivkhs may be related to the Susuya, Okhotsk, and Tobinitai culture that reached Hokkaido and met the Satsumon culture. Several historians suggest that the Nivkh were present in the kingdom of Goguryeo. There are indications that the ancestors of the Nivkh may have played a much more prominent role in pre- and protohistorical Manchuria. Nivkh lands extended along the northern coast of Manchuria from the Russian fortress at Tugur Bay eastward to the mouth of the Amur River at Nikolayevsk, then south through the Strait of Tartary as far as De Castries Bay. Formerly their territories had extended westwards at least as far as the Uda river and the Shantar Islands until pushed out by the Manchus and, later, the Russians.

The earliest mention of the Nivkh in history is believed to be a 12th-century Chinese chronicle, referring to a people called &quot;Jílièmí&quot; (), who were in contact with the Mongol rulers of Yuan China. They had been allied with the Mongols since 1263, and the Mongols invaded Sakhalin to aid the Nivkh against the Ainu, who had been encroaching on Sakhalin from Hokkaido. In 1643, Vassili Poyarkov was the first Russian to write of the Nivkh, calling them &quot;Gilyak&quot;, a Tungus exonym, by which they would be referred until the 1920s.

After the Yuan period, Ainu and Nivkh of Sakhalin became tributaries to the Ming dynasty of China after Manchuria came under Ming rule as part of the Nurgan Regional Military Commission. Boluohe, Nanghar and Wuliehe were Yuan posts set up to receive tribute from the Ainu after their war with the Yuan ended in 1308. Ming Chinese outposts in Sakhalin and the Amur river area received animal skin tribute from Ainu on Sakhalin, Uilta and Nivkh in the 15th century after the Tyr-based Yongning Temple was set up along with the Nurkan (Nurgan) outposts by the Yongle emperor in 1409. The Ming also held the post at Wuliehe and received marten pelt fur tribute from assistant commander Alige in 1431 from Sakhalin after the Ming assigned titles like weizhenfu (official charged with subjugation), zhihui qianshi (assistance commander), zhihui tongzhi (vice commander) and Zhihuishi (commander) to Sakhalin Indigenous headmen. The Ming received tribute from the headmen of Alingge, Tuolingha, Sanchiha and Zhaluha in 1437.

The position of headman among Sakhalin Indigenous peoples was inherited paternally from father to son and the sons came with their fathers to Wuliehe. Ming officials gave silk uniforms with the appropriate rank to the Sakhalin Ainu, Uilta and Nivkh after they paid tribute. The Maritime Province region had the Ming &quot;system for subjugated peoples&#x27; implementers in it for the Sakhalin Indigenous peoples. Sakhalin received iron tools from mainland Asia through this trade, as Tungus groups joined in from 1456-1487. Local Indigenous hierarchies had Ming Chinese given political offices integrated with them. The Ming system on Sakhalin was imitated by the Qing.

Nivkh women in Sakhalin married Han Chinese Ming officials when the Ming took tribute from Sakhalin and the Amur river region. Local Sakhalin native chiefs had their daughters taken as wives by Manchu officials, as sanctioned by the Qing dynasty when the Qing exercised jurisdiction in Sakhalin and took tribute from them.

Due to Ming rule in Manchuria, Chinese cultural and religious influence such as Chinese New Year, the &quot;Chinese god&quot;, Chinese motifs like the dragon, spirals, scrolls, and material goods like agriculture, husbandry, heating, iron cooking pots, silk, and cotton spread among the Amur natives like the Udeghes, Ulchis, and Nanais.

===Tsarist Russia and Imperial Japan===
For many centuries, the Nivkh were tributaries of the Manchus. After the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689, they functioned as intermediaries between the Russians, Manchu and Japanese, and also the Ainu, who were vassals of the Japanese. Early contact with the southern Sakhalin Ainu was generally hostile, although trade between the two was apparent.

The Nivkh suffered severely from the Cossack conquest and imposition of Tsarist Russians; they called the latter (devils). The Russian Empire gained complete control over Nivkh lands after the 1858 Treaty of Aigun and the 1860 Convention of Peking. The Russians established a penal colony (&quot;katorga&quot;) on Sakhalin, which operated from 1857 to 1906. They transported numerous Russian criminal and political exiles there, including Lev Sternberg, an important early ethnographer of the Nivkh. The Nivkh were soon outnumbered; they were sometimes employed as prison guards and to track escaped convicts. The Nivkh suffered epidemics of smallpox, plague, and influenza, brought by the immigrants and spread in the crowded, unsanitary prison environment.

Though the Empire of Japan never controlled the northern part of Sakhalin, Japan and Russia jointly ruled the island as part of the 1855 Treaty of Shimoda. From the 1875 Treaty of Saint Petersburg until the 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth, Russia governed all of Sakhalin. From 1905 to 1945, Sakhalin was partitioned between Russia and Japan along the 50th N parallel. Russia allowed Japanese entrepreneur fishermen in Nivkh lands from the 1880s until 1948. The Russian Priamur governor-generalship had difficulty finding Russian labour and allowed Japanese and Nivkh fishermen to develop the area, though they were heavily taxed. Russian authorities prevented the Nivkh from fishing in prior coastal and river systems via bans and high taxes from cached fish. The first of many incidents of over-exploitation of fisheries by the Japanese (and later the Russians) on the Tartar Strait and lower Amur occurred in 1898. It drove many Nivkhs into starvation if they could not import expensive Russian foods.

===Under Soviet rule===
Russia underwent the October Revolution forming the Soviet Union in 1922. The new government altered prior Russian Imperial policies towards the Nivkh that were in line with communist ideology. Soviet officials embraced the autonym &quot;Nivkh&quot; to replace the old term &quot;Gilyak&quot;, as a hallmark for new native self-determination. A brief autonomous okrug was created for the Nivkh. The government granted them extensive fishing rights, which were not rescinded until the 1960s. But, other Soviet policies proved devastating. The Nivkh were forced into mass agricultural and industrial labour collectives called &quot;kolkhoz&quot;. Nivkh fishermen were difficult to convert to agricultural practices because of their belief that ploughing the earth was a sin. The Nivkh were soon working and living as a second-class minority group among the massive Russian labour force.

These collectives irrevocably altered the lifestyle of the Nivkh. The traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle disappeared. Soviet authorities showcased the Nivkh as a &#x27;model&#x27; nation for a culture quickly transforming from the Neolithic to a socialist industrial model. They banned the use of the Nivkh language from schools and the public square. The Russian language was mandated and russification of the Nivkh accelerated. Many Nivkh stories, beliefs, and clan ties were forgotten by new generations.

From 1945 to 1948, many Nivkh, as well as half of the Oroks and all of the Sakhalin Ainu, who had been living under Japanese jurisdiction in the southern half of Sakhalin, were forced to move to Japan along with the ethnic Japanese settlers. Many indigenous people would later return to the area. According to &quot;Modern Ainu: The Romance of Ethnic Migration&quot; (現代のアイヌ : 民族移動のロマン, by Kosuge Sugawara, 1966 under Genbunsha), these Nivkh people in Japan resided in Abashiri, Hakodate, and Sapporo. One notable displaced Nivkh from Karafuto to Abashiri was Chiyo Nakamura (1906–1969), a shaman from Poronaisk (). By 2004, the Nivkh-Orok community in Abashiri had apparently vanished.

Chuner Taksami, an anthropologist, is considered the first modern Nivkh literary figure and supporter of Siberian rights. In the post-Soviet Russian commonwealth of nations, the Nivkh have fared better than the Ainu or the Itelmens, but worse than the Chukchi or the Tuvans. The Soviet government in 1962 resettled many of the Nivkh into fewer, denser settlements, such that Sakhalin settlements had been reduced from 82 to 13 by 1986. This relocation was accomplished via the Soviet collectives that the Nivkh had become so dependent on. The closure of state-funded amenities such as a school or electricity generator prompted citizenry to move into government-preferred settlements.

===After the Soviet collapse===
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the &quot;kolkhoz&quot; collectives were abandoned. The Nivkh were dependent on the state-funded collectives, and with their dissolution, rapid economic hardship ensued for the already impoverished populace. At present, the Nivkh living in the north of Sakhalin see their future threatened by the giant offshore oil extraction projects known as Sakhalin-I and Sakhalin-II, operated by foreign Western firms. Since January 2005, the Nivkh, led by their elected leader Alexey Limanzo, have engaged in non-violent protest actions, demanding an independent ethnological assessment of Shell&#x27;s and Exxon&#x27;s plans. Solidarity actions have been staged in Moscow, New York City and later in Berlin. The monthly Nivkh newspaper, &quot;Nivkh Dif&quot;, established in 1990, is published in the West-Sakhalin dialect and is headquartered in the village of Nekrasovka.

==Society==

===Village life===
The Nivkh were semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers with summer and winter settlements. Nivkh villages consisted of three to four households shared by several families with larger villages rare, and mostly located on the Amur estuary. Households were shared for reasons of community and survival during the harsh cold winters. Villages would last for several decades but were susceptible to floods and sometimes vanished. Many were wiped out during the devastating Amur floods of 1915 and 1968. Often households contained families that were not related. The village was usually composed of people from two to eight different clans, four being standard.

In the late fall, able-bodied Nivkh men would leave the villages to hunt for game in the surrounding hunting grounds whereas women would gather foods from the forests. Nivkh would move to winter settlements near rivers to survive the harsh snows and catch salmon spawning (see list of Nivkh settlements). The Nivkh were very hospitable, such that the Nanai located upstream on the Amur when faced with hard times would often visit or stay in Nivkh villages.

===Clan===
Nivkh clans (&quot;khal&quot;) were a group of people united by marriage ties, a common derived deity, arranging marriages, and responsible for group dispute resolution. The clan is divided into three exogamous sub-clans. A clan would cooperate with other members on hunts and fishing when away from the village. A Nivkh clan believed they had &quot;one (common) &quot;akhmalk&quot; or &quot;imgi&quot;, one fire, one mountain man, one bear, one devil, one tkhusind (ransom, or clan penalty), and one sin.&quot;

===Marriage===
Marriage tended to be exogamic unlike many paleo-Siberian groups. Although within the clan, marriage is endogamic, while sub-clans are exogamic. Nivkh marriage customs were very complicated and controlled by the clan. Cross-cousin marriage seems to be the original custom with the clan, a latter necessity when the clan was unable to marry individuals without breaking taboo. The bride price was probably introduced by the Neo-Siberians. The dowry was shared by the clan. The number of men generally exceeded the number of women. It was hard to gain wives, as they were few and expensive. This led to the wealthier men having more than one wife and poor men being unable to obtain wives.

Nivkh&#x27;s traditional religion was based on animist beliefs, especially via shamanism, before colonial Russians made efforts to convert the population to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Nivkh animists believe the island of Sakhalin is a giant beast lying on its belly with the trees of the island as its hair. When the beast is upset, it awakens and trembles the earth causing earthquakes. Nivkh have a pantheon of vaguely defined gods () that presided over the mountains, rivers, seas and sky. Nivkhs&#x27; have extensive folklore, songs, and mythos of how humans and the universe were created, and of how fantastic heroes, spirits and beasts battled with each other in ancient times. Some Nivkhs have converted to Russian Orthodoxy or other religions, though many still practice traditional beliefs. Fire is especially venerated. It is the symbol of the unity of the clan. Fire is considered a deity of their ancestors, protecting them from evil spirits and guarding their clan from harm. An open flame would be &quot;fed&quot; a leaf of tobacco, spices, or a tipple of vodka in order to please the spirits for protection. Nivkhs would also frequently offer items to the deities by &#x27;feeding&#x27;. The sea would be &quot;fed&quot; an item of importance in order that the sea god protects the travellers.

===Shamanism===
Shamans&#x27; (&quot;ch&#x27;am&quot;) main role was in diagnosing and curing disease for the Nivkh. The rare shamans typically wore an elaborate coats with belts often made of metal. Remedies composed of plant and sometimes animal matter were employed to cure sickness. Talismans were used or offered to patients to prevent sickness. Shamans additionally functioned as a conduit to combat and ward off evil spirits that cause death. A shaman&#x27;s services usually were compensated with goods, quarters and food.

===Bear Festival===
Nivkh Shamans also presided over the Bear Festival, a traditional holiday celebrated between January and February depending on the clan. Bears were captured and raised in a corral for several years by local women, who treated the bear like a child. The bear was considered a sacred earthly manifestation of Nivkh ancestors and the gods in bear form (see Bear worship). During the festival, the bear would be dressed in a specially-made ceremonial costume. It would be offered a banquet to take back to the realm of gods to show benevolence upon the clans. After the banquet, the bear would be sacrificed and eaten in an elaborate religious ceremony. Dogs were often sacrificed as well. The bear&#x27;s spirit returned to the gods of the mountain &#x27;happy&#x27; and would then reward the Nivkh with bountiful forests. The festival typically would be arranged by relatives to honour the death of a kinsman. Generally, the Bear Festival was an inter-clan ceremony where a clan of wife-takers restored ties with a clan of wife-givers upon the broken link of the kinsman&#x27;s death. The Bear Festival was suppressed during Soviet occupation though the festival has had a modest revival since the decline of Soviet Union, albeit as a cultural instead of religious ceremony.

A very similar ceremony, Iomante, is practiced by the Ainu people of Japan.

==Environment==
The Russian Far East has a cold and harsh climate. In the fish-rich Amur River estuary in the districts of Nixhne-Amruskii and Takhtinskii, winters have high winds and heavy snows with mid-winter usually averaging from . Summers are wet and moderately warm ranging between . The area&#x27;s biome is characterized as Taiga and evergreen coniferous forests consisting of larch, yew, birch, maple, lilac, honeysuckle, and extensive low-lying swamp grasses. Higher elevations have spruce, fir, ash, lime, walnut and mountain tops have cedar and lichens. Bears, foxes, sables, hares, Siberian tigers, elks, grouse, and deer typical near the Amur outlet which usually floods during the rainy season.

Northern Sakhalin is harsher ecologically with mostly Taiga. Winters are longer, with a mean temperature of , however, short summers are warmer averaging due to warmer Pacific Ocean currents moving around the island. Heavy snows blanket the island of Sakhalin (&quot;Yh-mif&quot; in Nivkh) during winter, due to monsoon winds blowing from Siberia, drawing humidity as they pass over the Sea of Okhotsk, Sea of Japan, and the Strait of Tartary. Barren tundra dominates the north, with sparse trees such as larch, birch and various grasses, while moving southward, spruce and fir are seen. Bears, foxes, otters, lynx, and reindeer are common wildlife. The Island&#x27;s major rivers are the Tym&#x27; and Poronai, rich in fish, especially salmon. Before Russian colonization, Nivkh villages could be found on these rivers approximately every 5 km.

The Strait of Tartary is currently only wide and is shallow enough that an ice bridge forms during the winter that can be traversed by foot or dog-sledge. At the glacial maximum of the Ice Age, sea levels were lower than they are today. The Eurasia continent was connected to Sakhalin via the Strait of Tatar and Hokkaidō via the Soya Strait of which humans migrated. This connection explains the similarities of trees, plants, and animals including now-extinct mammoths. The receding ice age warmed the area, allowing greater tree cover and wildlife, thus new resources for the Nivkhs to exploit. The opening of the Soya and then the shallower Strait of Tartary allowed warm pacific currents to bathe the island and the lower Amur River.

==Technology==

===Dwellings===
Nivkhs lived in two types of self-built winter dwellings. The most ancient of these was the (or &quot;to&quot;). The dwelling was a round dugout about 7.5 meters (23 feet) in diameter, shored up by wooden poles and covered with packed dirt and grass. The had a fireplace in the centre and a smoke hole for light and smoke escape. The other type of dwelling used for winter is the similar to the Nanai &quot;dio&quot; which was modelled after Manchurian and Chinese dwellings of the Amur. The were one-room structures with a gable roof and a &quot;kang&quot; (Chinese furnace) for heating. A nearby shed held sledges, skis, boats, and dogs.

===Clothing===
Nivkhs traditionally wore robes (&quot;skiy&quot; for men, for women) having three buttons, fastened on the left side of the body. Winter garments were made of skins from fish, seal, sable, and furs from otter, lynx, fox, and dog. Women&#x27;s extended below the knee and were light multicoloured with intricate embroideries and various ornaments sewed on the sleeves, collar and hem. Ornaments were coins, bells, or beads made of wood, glass, or metal mostly originating from Manchurian and Chinese traders. Men&#x27;s &quot;skiy&quot; were darker coloured, shorter, and had pockets built into the sleeves. Men&#x27;s clothing were less elaborate with ornaments on the sleeve and left lapel. Men would also wear a loose kilt called a &quot;kosk&quot; when hunting or travelling on dog-sledge. Boots were made of fish-, seal-, or deerskin, and very watertight. Fur hats (&quot;hak&quot;) were worn in winter, with the furry tails and ears of the animal often adorning the back and crown of the hat. Summer hats (&quot;hiv hak&quot;) were conical and made from birch-bark. Since Soviet collectivization, Nivkh mostly wear mass-produced Western clothing, but traditional clothing is worn for holidays and cultural events.

==Diet==
The Nivkh had a diverse diet, as they were semi-sedentary before colonization. Fish was the main source of food for the Nivkh, including pink, Pacific, and chum salmon as well as trout, red eye, burbot and pike found in rivers and streams. Saltwater fishing provided saffron cod, flatfish, and marine goby caught on the littoral coasts of the Strait of Tartary, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean, though over fishing by Russian and Japanese trawlers has depleted many of these fish stocks. Additionally, industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged the soil of the estuaries. There is a traditional preservation process called &quot;yukola&quot;, involving slicing the fish in a particular way and drying the strips by hanging them in the frigid air, without salt. The preservation process created a lot of dried fish waste, unpalatable for human consumption but utilized for dog food. Pulverizing dried fish and mixing it with fish skins, water, seal fat, and berries until the mixture had a sour cream consistency is a favorite Nivkh dish called &quot;mos&quot;. Nivkhs would hunt seal (larga, ringed, ribbon, sea lions), duck, sable, and otters. They would gather various berries, wild leeks, lily bulbs, and nuts. Contacts with the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese from the 12th century on introduced new foods incorporated in the Nivkhs’ diet, such as salt, sugar, rice, millet, legumes and tea. Russian 19th-century colonisation introduced flour, bread, potatoes, vodka, tobacco, butter, canned vegetables and fruits, and other meats.

==Population genetics==
===Y-chromosomal DNA haplogroups===
Lell &quot;et al.&quot; (2002) tested a sample of seventeen Nivkh males and found that six of them (35%) belonged to Haplogroup C-M48, six of them (35%) belonged to haplogroup P-M45 (xQ-M3, R-M17), two of them (12%) belonged to haplogroup C-M130 (xM48), two of them (12%) belonged to haplogroup K-M9 (xO-M119, O-M122, N-Tat, P-M45), and one of them (6%) belonged to haplogroup O-M119.

Tajima &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) tested a sample of twenty-one Nivkh males and found that eight of them (38%) belonged to haplogroup C-M217, a haplogroup which is also common among Koryaks, Itelmens, Yukaghirs, Tungusic peoples, and Mongols; six (29%) belonged to haplogroup K-M9 (xO-M122, O-M119, P-P27), four of them (19%) belonged to haplogroup P-P27 (xR-SRY10831.2), two of them (9.5%) belonged to R-SRY10831.2, and one of them (4.8%) belonged to Haplogroup BT-SRY10831.1 (xC-RPS4Y711, DE-YAP, K-M9).

According to the abstract for a doctoral dissertation by Vladimir Nikolaevich Kharkov, a sample of 52 Nivkhs from Sakhalin Oblast contained the following Y-DNA haplogroups: 71% (37/52) C-M217 (xC-M77/M86, C-M407), 7.7% (4/52) O-M324 (xO-M134), 7.7% (4/52) Q-M242 (xQ-M346), 5.8% (3/52) D-M174, 3.8% (2/52) O-M175 (xO-P31, O-M122), 1.9% (1/52) O-P31, and 1.9% (1/52) N-M46/M178.

Kharkov et al. (2024) examined the Y-chromosome haplogroups of 37 Nivkh males in the Okhinsky District of Sakhalin Oblast, who were estimated to have no paternal admixture with other ethnic groups. The results showed that 43.2% (16/37) belonged to haplogroup C2a1a2b-B90, 32.4% (12/37) to C2a1a1b1a-F13958, 10.8% (4/37) to C2a1-ACT1942, 8.1% (3/37) to Q1a1a1-M120, and 5.4% (2/37) to O2a1b1a2a-F238.

===Mitochondrial DNA haplogroups===

Torroni &quot;et al.&quot; (1993) reported collecting blood samples from 57 &quot;unrelated and unhybridized Nivkh individuals living in Rybnovsk and Nekrasovka villages in northern Sakhalin Island.&quot; According to Starikovskaya &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) and Bermisheva &quot;et al.&quot; (2005), the members of this sample of Nivkhs belong to haplogroup Y (37/57 = 64.9%), haplogroup D (16/57 = 28.1%), haplogroup G1 (3/57 = 5.3%), and haplogroup M (xC, Z, D, G) (1/57 = 1.8%).

In another sample of Nivkhs, possibly &quot;those living on the continent&quot; (although there appears to be an error in the original text), Bermisheva &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) have found the following mtDNA haplogroups: 67.3% (37/55) haplogroup Y, 25.5% (14/55) haplogroup G, 3.6% (2/55) haplogroup D, 1.8% (1/55) haplogroup M (xC, Z, D, G), and 1.8% (1/55) haplogroup N or R (xA, B, F, Y).

According to Duggan &quot;et al.&quot; (2013), the members of a sample of 38 Nivkhs collected in northern Sakhalin belonged to haplogroup Y1a (25/38 = 65.8%), haplogroup D4m2 (10/38 = 26.3%), and haplogroup G1b (3/38 = 7.9%). One identical Y1a haplotype was shared by eight Nivkh individuals, another Y1a haplotype was shared by six Nivkh individuals, and two other Y1a haplotypes were shared by three Nivkh individuals each, indicating a low genetic diversity of this population. Likewise, one identical D4m2 haplotype was shared by four Nivkh individuals, another D4m2 haplotype was shared by two Nivkh individuals, and a third D4m2 haplotype was shared by two or three Nivkh individuals and a Northeast Yakut individual. The authors also have found Haplogroup Y1a in 13.3% (2/15) of Berezovka Evens, 12.5% (3/24) of Taimyr Evenks, 6.5% (2/31) of Udegeys, 2.6% (1/39) of Kamchatka Evens, and 2.3% (2/88) of Central Yakuts, and they have noted that other studies have reported finding this haplogroup in high frequency in the Ulchi and Negidal, in 9%-10% of Koryaks and eastern Evenks, as well as in low frequency in Central and Vilyuy Yakuts. Besides the Nivkhs, the authors also have found mtDNA that belongs to haplogroup D4m2 in 8.7% (2/23) Sakkyryyr Evens, 3.7% (1/27) Tompo Evens, and 3.1% (1/32) Northeast Yakuts, with the Northeast Yakut individual sharing an identical haplotype with several of the Nivkhs. The authors have noted that mtDNA sequences that belong to the same branch of haplogroup D have been found in Evenks, Evens, Yukaghirs, and South Siberian Buryats and Turkic speakers, and another study has reported one instance of D4m2 in a sample of 154 Dolgans. As for G1b, the other mtDNA haplogroup found among Nivkhs, Duggan &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) also have found it in their samples of Kamchatka Evens (6/39 = 15.4%), Koryaks (2/15 = 13.3%), Yukaghirs (2/20 = 10.0%), Iengra Evenks (2/21 = 9.5%), and Tompo Evens (1/27 = 3.7%), and they have cited Starikovskaya &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) as evidence for their statement that haplogroup G1 is also common in the Negidal. According to YFull and Dryomov &quot;et al.&quot; (2020), two members of haplogroup G1b from the Nivkh sample of Duggan &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) belong to G1b-G16129A!*, whereas the remaining member of haplogroup G1b from that sample belongs to G1b1a-G16244A.

М. А. Gubina &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) examined the mitochondrial DNA of a sample of seventeen Nivkhs from the village of Nogliki, Nogliksky District, Sakhalin Oblast and found that they belonged to haplogroup Y (8/17 = 47.1%, all Y1a+T16189C!), haplogroup D (3/17 = 17.6%, including 2/17 D4e5b and 1/17 D4j4a), haplogroup G (3/17 = 17.6%, including 2/17 G1b1-16207 and 1/17 G1b1a-16244), haplogroup H (2/17 = 11.8%), and haplogroup U5 (1/17 = 5.9%). Besides the Western Eurasian influence apparent in the presence of haplogroups H and U5 among Nivkhs of Nogliki, it is also notable that there is no overlap between the Nivkh samples of Duggan &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) and Gubina &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) in regard to the subclades of haplogroups D4 and G1b to which they belong except for a single member of G1b1a-G16244A in each sample.

<doc id="580888" wikidata="Q2037783" url="?curid=580888" title="World of Tiers">
<text>The World of Tiers is a series of science fiction novels by American writer Philip José Farmer. They are set within a series of artificially constructed universes, created and ruled by decadent beings who are genetically identical to humans, but regard themselves as superior, and are the inheritors of an advanced technology they no longer understand. This technology enables the &quot;Lords&quot; (or &quot;Thoans&quot;, as described by Farmer in his introduction to a role-playing video game) to create novel lifeforms, and also to prevent aging or disease, making them effectively immortal. Their technology also allows them to create small artificial universes (see pocket universe), and the planets and stars within them, and modify the physical laws (e.g., changing the behavior of gravity) to create unusual or interesting phenomena within these universes. Instantaneous travel within and between these universes is achieved by the use of &quot;gates&quot; which seem to function as teleportation devices, or as a means of creating wormholes between different regions of spacetime. 

The overall series title comes from the main &quot;pocket universe&quot; featured in the books. This consists of a single planet with a green sky, shaped in the form of a huge stepped pyramid on five stages, with each stage being a disk or squat cylinder. A small sun and a single moon orbit around this planet (thus, in this universe geocentrism is a correct description of astronomical reality). There are no other stars or astronomical bodies. This world was created by a Lord named Jadawin. 

The overall storyline of the series follows the adventures of two people from Earth who independently discover gates into the World of Tiers. The earlier books focus on the character of Robert Wolff as he explores this world and tries to discover its secrets. From the third book onwards the action shifts to Paul Janus Finnegan (known as &quot;Kickaha&quot;, along with many other aliases), who is drawn into a battle between an ancient enemy of the Lords, and ultimately into the feuds between rival Lords as they try to take over each other&#x27;s universes.

A French-language roleplaying game, &quot;Thoan - Les Faiseurs d&#x27;Univers&quot;, inspired by the World of Tiers, was released in 1995.

==Novels==
The novels in the series are:

* &quot;The Maker of Universes&quot; (1965)
* &quot;The Gates of Creation&quot; (1966)
* &quot;A Private Cosmos&quot; (1968)
* &quot;Behind the Walls of Terra&quot; (1970)
* &quot;The Lavalite World&quot; (1977)
* &quot;More Than Fire&quot; (1993)

The novel &quot;Red Orc&#x27;s Rage&quot; (1991) has marginal connections with the series. Although the main characters from the other books do not appear directly, this novel provides some background material on events and characters in the other novels.

==Setting==
The broad setting of the novels is a series of artificially constructed universes. The majority of the stories take place on the world created by the Lord Jadawin. This planet consists of a series of cylindrical layers stacked one atop the other, to form an enormous, approximately conical tower (albeit much broader than it is tall). The top surfaces (levels or tiers) of each cylindrical monolith are densely inhabited, while the vertical sides of the monoliths act as enormous cliffs (30,000-100,000 feet / 9,000-30,000 metres high) which partially isolate the inhabitants of each tier from each other. These cliffs do provide some purchase for climbing, and many specialized creatures live on the cliff surfaces, so this isolation is not complete.

There is no diminution of atmosphere from one level to the next, due to Jadawin&#x27;s manipulation of the local gravitational fields. The various tiers are populated with plants and animals creating different environments. Some of these were abducted from Earth throughout history, while many were created in Jadawin&#x27;s biolabs. Many creatures have bodies created by Jadawin to replicate mythological creatures (e.g. merpeople, centaurs) implanted with the minds of abducted humans. The various inhabitants are immortal as far as physical aging is concerned, though they can be killed by most other means.

===Structure and scale===
The pocket universe in which the World of Tiers is located contains only three astronomical objects;
* Alofmethbin (the Thoan name for the World of Tiers)
* a single moon orbiting Alofmethbin
* a single tiny star, also orbiting Alofmethbin

====Alofmethbin====
The World of Tiers consists of a stack of cylindrical monoliths. The &quot;tiers&quot; of the title are habitable environments on the upper surface of each cylinder. The tiers are, in order from largest (bottom) to smallest (top):

* Okeanos – watery, Garden of Eden, populated by people abducted from ancient Greece.
* Amerind – prehistoric North America, populated by people abducted from North and Central America.
* Dracheland – medieval/Arthurian, populated by people from medieval Germany.
* Atlantis – was a major civilization, now ruins and jungle.
* Palace of Jadawin

and the monoliths on top of which the tiers are located are:
* Thayaphaeawoed (surmounted by the Amerind tier)
* Abharhploonta (surmounted by the Dracheland tier)
* Doozvillnavava (surmounted by the Atlantis tier)
* Idaquizzoorhruz (surmounted by the Palace of Jadawin)

The exact dimensions of the monoliths are not stated, and so they must be inferred from hints in the novels, such as the quote above. Unfortunately the various statements in the books seem to be inconsistent. For instance, the distance from the
outer edge of the Amerind tier to the base of the monolith Abharhploonta is quoted as being 1500 miles (approximately 2400 km), while the surface area of the Amerind tier is quoted as being equal to that of North and South America combined (approximately 42 million square kilometers). From this information it can be inferred that the outer radius of the Amerind tier (and hence the radius of the monolith Thayaphaeawoed) is approximately 4000 km. The next tier down (Okeanos) consists of a circular ocean girdling the monolith Thayaphaeawoed, approximately 480 kilometers wide, and a circular beach and forest. The edge of the Okeanos tier is easily reached by foot from the beach in less than a day. It follows that the outer radius of the lowest (largest) tier of the planet is approximately 4500 km. This disagrees with the quote above, since, in order to have a surface area equal to that of the water surface of Earth, the world of tiers would require a radius of approximately 10,700 km.

Furthermore, the heights of the various monoliths are not consistent between novels. As one example, in the first novel of the series the monolith Idaquizzoorhruz is quoted as being 30,000 feet (approximately 10 km) tall, while in the third novel it is stated as being 100,000 feet (approximately 33 km) tall. These discrepancies may be explained by saying that the various characters initial estimates of the height of the monoliths are inaccurate, and become more accurate as they learn 
more about Alofmethbin.

In any case, while the overall shape of the planet is a conical stepped pyramid, it is clearly much broader (several thousand kilometers) than it is tall (around 100 km).

====Moon====
The single moon orbiting Alofmethbin is quoted as being approximately the same size as the planet Mars. The moon as seen from Alofmethbin is described as appearing two-and-a-half times bigger than Earth&#x27;s moon. If this refers to the moon&#x27;s angular width, we can infer that the moon orbits Alofmethbin at a distance of approximately 300,000 km.

==Story and characters==
===Major characters===
====Robert Wolff/Lord Jadawin====
Robert Wolff is a retired linguistics professor in his sixties. While inspecting a house to purchase and live in during retirement with his wife, a gate to the World of Tiers opens before him. He passes through this gate, arriving on the Okeanos level. There he regains his youth and health, due to the effects of drugs in the water supply provided by the Lord Jadawin. He meets and falls in love with Chryseis, and when she is kidnapped, he sets out to rescue her, ascending the various levels of the planet. Most of this journey is undertaken in the company of Paul Janus Finnegan, aka Kickaha.
Wolff and Jadawin are the same person.

====Paul Janus Finnegan/Kickaha====
Paul Janus Finnegan was born in Indiana in 1918, and served in the American army during the Second World War, driving a tank. In the ruins of a museum in a small German town, he discovered a metal crescent made of an apparently indestructible metal, and kept it as a souvenir. This crescent proved to be one half of a gate to the World of Tiers, the other half belonging to a displaced Thoan who attempted to buy (and later, steal) the crescent from him. Finnegan interrupted the Thoan in the middle of entering the gate and accidentally activated the completed gate himself, ending up transported to the World of Tiers. 

At the start of the first novel in the series, Finnegan has lived on the World of Tiers for approximately twenty-four years. In that time, he has learned many of the local languages, become extremely skilled at knife-throwing, archery, and other combat and outdoors survival skills, and lived under many assumed names and identities. In Dracheland, his identity is &quot;Baron Horst von Horstman&quot;, whose coat of arms is a red jackass&#x27; head surmounting a fist with the middle finger extended. His favourite identity is that of Kickaha (meaning &quot;trickster&quot;), which he uses on the Amerind level.

Paul Janus Finnegan shares the initials of the author (PJF). This is also true of one of the main characters in the Riverworld series, Peter Jairus Frigate.

In &quot;The Lavalite World&quot;, Philip José Farmer strongly implies that Finnegan is the great grandson of Phileas Fogg, the hero of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

====Chryseis====
Chryseis is a woman abducted from Earth by Jadawin, who has had her mind implanted into a new body 
created in Jadawin&#x27;s biolabs. She claims to be the same Chryseis, daughter of Chryses portrayed in the tale of the Trojan War. The body created for her by Jadawin is essentially human, except that her eyes are exceptionally large in proportion to her face (like a cat&#x27;s eyes), her legs are exceptionally long, and her hair is tiger-striped.

====Anana====
Anana, also known as Anana the Bright, is a Thoan, sister of Jadawin. She is driven out of her own universe by an ancient enemy that threatens to destroy all the Thoans, and takes refuge in the World of Tiers where she meets Kickaha. She is initially arrogant and cruel, as most Thoans are, but is impressed by Kickaha&#x27;s resourcefulness, and gradually becomes more sympathetic and humane as she falls in love with him.

====Podarge====
Podarge, a terrible and extremely dangerous harpy, whose fantastic winged body was created by Wolff during his former life as Lord Jadawin, and who was given the brain of an ancient Greek woman by Wolff/Jadawin, appears periodically as both an ally and foe in the World of Tiers series. Podarge and her huge air armada of giant green eagles (and many of the individuals in it), often play pivotal parts in this story. Podarge&#x27;s face was based on that of Wolff/Jadawin&#x27;s sister, Anana the Bright.

===Storyline===
The first book in the series opens with Robert Wolff finding a gate into the World of Tiers, which Kickaha 
opens in order to escape from creatures sent by the Lord of that world. Wolff enters the World of Tiers, arriving on the Okeanos level, and over the space of a few months regains his youth thanks to chemicals in the water and food. He meets Chryseis and falls in love with her, but she is captured by the same creatures who captured Kickaha. Wolff sets out to pursue them, climbing the monolith towards the second (Amerind) level of the planet. On the way he meets Kickaha again, and the two join forces to rescue Chryseis. Eventually they 
ascend all the levels of the planet and launch an attack on the Lord&#x27;s palace. It is revealed that Wolff was actually the Lord, Jadawin, who created the World of Tiers, but that he was attacked by another Lord and marooned on Earth, where the shock of being in such primitive surroundings caused him to suffer amnesia.

In the second book, Wolff, now reinstalled as the Lord of the World of Tiers (but more humane and compassionate, after his amnesia erased the original Jadawin personality), enters a Universe constructed by his father, Urizen. Urizen has kidnapped Chryseis, and Wolff finds himself reunited with his brothers, sisters and cousins, all of whom must travel from one dangerous planet to another to escape. 

The third book chronicles Kickaha&#x27;s adventures while the events of the second book are occurring. He meets three dispossessed Lords (one of whom is Anana) who are fleeing an army led by the Black Bellers – artificial intelligences capable of taking over the bodies of human hosts. It is revealed that the civilization of the Thoans, including their understanding of the scientific principles behind their advanced technology, was destroyed during the war with the Black Bellers ten thousand years before. Since then the few remaining Black Bellers have been in hiding, waiting for an opportunity to rebuild their ranks and attempt to take over again. Kickaha and Anana are pursued across the Amerind level, as they attempt to escape and simultaneously counterattack the Black Bellers. Eventually they enter the Lord&#x27;s palace and manage to kill all but one of the Bellers, who flees to Earth. 

It is revealed that Earth is itself an artificial world constructed to be an exact replica of the Thoan&#x27;s home world during the stone age, and allowed to develop as a social experiment. Earth&#x27;s &quot;pocket universe&quot; extends only to the edges of the solar system; the rest of the visible universe is effectively a 3-D Trompe-l&#x27;œil on the walls of the pocket universe. It is strongly implied that this is all an exact copy of the Thoans&#x27; homeworld universe and that Thoa is itself artificial, but this question is not explored in the later novels. 

The remaining books in the series follow Kickaha and Anana as they travel to Earth to kill the final Black Beller. The secret Lord of Earth, Red Orc, attempts to kill Kickaha and Anana despite their informing him that they simply want to kill the last Black Beller and will then leave peacefully. Eventually they manage to kill the Black Beller, but wind up in a battle between Red Orc and another Lord called Urthona. They are all gated to the Lavalite world, a planet that changes shape periodically like the wax in a lava lamp, and which was created by Urthona. The only gate out of this world is located in Urthona&#x27;s palace, which floats over the surface of the planet. Finally they manage to return to the World of Tiers and go searching for Wolff and Chryseis who have disappeared. 

The final book of the series takes place fifteen years later, Anana and Kickaha having been directed into a trap universe by Red Orc. They escape, but Kickaha is forced by Red Orc to go in search of an entrance to a universe he found ten thousand years earlier but has been unable to return to. Red Orc wants Kickaha to bring a fresh approach to the problem. This universe contains the last remaining databanks that preserve the technology of the Thoans and Red Orc plans to use this technology to conquer all the artificial universes. The story culminates with Kickaha defeating Red Orc in hand-to-hand combat, and returning to the World of Tiers to resume his adventuring trickster lifestyle.

==Literary references==
The Jadawin family (or at least their names) are taken from William Blake&#x27;s mythology. This mythology is referred to by the characters in the stories (mainly in &quot;The Gates of Creation&quot;, &quot;Red Orc&#x27;s Rage&quot;, and &quot;More than Fire&quot;).

Many features of the world of tiers appear to be drawn from early cosmological ideas and mythologies. The structure of the world of tiers, with a central mountain or tower which the sun passes behind at night is equivalent to early Babylonian and Egyptian cosmological theories. The placement of the Lord&#x27;s palace at the highest level of the world is reminiscent of the home of the gods atop Mount Olympus. The lord Jadawin uses 
intelligent ravens that roam across the world, observing, carrying messages, and reporting back to him, 
much like Odin in Norse mythology (See Hugin and Munin. Notice also the similarity in the names Odin and Jadawin.)
The moon of the world of tiers is modelled after Barsoom, from Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; novels, a homage which Farmer openly admits in the third book of the series.

The novels are at least in part a vehicle to represent mythological character archetypes. Robert Wolff is a heroic character who primarily overcomes obstacles by using strength (physical and mental) to confront the Thoans. By contrast, the character of Kickaha is a trickster, who avoids the affairs of the god-like Thoans wherever possible, and who survives and defeats his enemies by cunning, trickery and skill. 

The central concept of the series is the existence of arrogant beings who possess awesome powers (as a result of technology) and use these powers to play the role of gods. They are able to travel from place to place almost instantaneously by using gates to teleport from one location or universe to another. This is extremely similar to several central concepts in the fictitious &quot;Stargate&quot; universe, although there is currently no suggestion that Stargate copied these ideas from the World of Tiers stories.

The overall setting: a family of feuding dimension hopping immortal lords, as well as the specific plot of the first book: wherein an amnesiac immortal lord must travel from Earth to another dimension to regain his powers, bears striking similarities to Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;Amber&quot; series. Indeed, Zelazny himself has acknowledged that in writing &quot;Nine Princes in Amber&quot; he drew inspiration from the World of Tiers.

<text>The Third Division North of the Football League was a tier in the English football league system from 1921 to 1958. It ran in parallel with the Third Division South with clubs elected to the League or relegated from a higher division allocated to one or the other according to geographical position. Some clubs in the English Midlands shuttled between the Third Division North and the Third Division South according to the composition of the two leagues in any one season.

The Third Division South had been created in 1921 from the Third Division formed the previous year made up of 22 teams drawn mostly from the Southern League. It was decided that this gave the Football League overall too much of a southern bias, so the Third Division North was created in 1921–22 to redress the balance. Stockport County had finished bottom of the Second Division at the end of the 1920–21 season, and they were relegated into this new division, where they joined Grimsby Town who had spent a season in the Third Division after relegation from the Second Division in 1919–20. As there was no northern equivalent of the Southern League, the remaining 18 teams came from several regional leagues: the Midland League, the Central League, the North Eastern League, the Lancashire Combination and the Birmingham &amp; District League.

The original 20 teams were: Stockport County, Darlington, Grimsby Town, Hartlepools United, Accrington Stanley, Crewe Alexandra, Stalybridge Celtic, Walsall, Southport, Ashington, Durham City, Wrexham, Chesterfield, Lincoln City, Barrow, Nelson, Wigan Borough, Tranmere Rovers, Halifax Town and Rochdale. The division was extended by a further two teams in 1923 to take the total to 22, and for the 1950–51 season the division was expanded to 24 clubs, with Scunthorpe &amp; Lindsey United and Shrewsbury Town joining.

Only one promotion place was available each season from the Third Division North to the Second Division, which made it very difficult to win promotion. Eight teams, Accrington Stanley, Barrow, Crewe Alexandra, Halifax Town, Hartlepools United, Rochdale, Southport and Wrexham, were ever-present in the division for the 30 years of its existence. Of the teams that played in Third Division North, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Derby County were later English football champions.

Its final season was 1957–58, after which the North and South sections were merged to form a single Third Division and the Fourth Division. The top 12 clubs in Division Three North, except for the Champions Scunthorpe United, went into the new Third Division, and the bottom 12 clubs went into the Fourth Division.

==Tournaments between Third Division North and South==

From 1934 to the outbreak of World War II there was a short-lived knockout competition Football League Third Division North Cup.

From the 1954–55 season until the 1957–58 season, there was a series of games between teams representing the Third Division North and the Third Division South.

<doc id="580905" wikidata="Q2114925" url="?curid=580905" title="Presence information">
<text>In computer and telecommunications networks, presence information is a status indicator that conveys ability and willingness of a potential communication partner—for example a user—to communicate. A user&#x27;s client provides presence information (presence state) via a network connection to a presence service, which is stored in what constitutes his personal availability record (called a presentity) and can be made available for distribution to other users (called &quot;watchers&quot;) to convey their availability for communication. Presence information has wide application in many communication services and is one of the innovations driving the popularity of instant messaging or recent implementations of voice over IP clients.

==Presence state==
A user client may publish a presence state to indicate its current communication status. This published state informs others that wish to contact the user of his availability and willingness to communicate. The most common use of presence today is to display an indicator icon on instant messaging clients, typically from a choice of graphic symbols with easy-to-convey meanings, and a list of corresponding text descriptions of each of the states. Even when technically not the same, the &quot;on-hook&quot; or &quot;off-hook&quot; state of called telephone is an analogy, as long as the caller receives a distinctive tone indicating unavailability or availability.

Common states on the user&#x27;s availability are &quot;free for chat&quot;, &quot;busy&quot;, &quot;away&quot;, &quot;do not disturb&quot;, &quot;out to lunch&quot;. Such states exist in many variations across different modern instant messaging clients. Current standards support a rich choice of additional presence attributes that can be used for presence information, such as user mood, location, or free text status.

The analogy with free/busy tone on PSTN is inexact, as the &quot;on-hook&quot; telephone status reflects the ability of the network to reach the recipient after the requester has initiated the conversation. The requester must commit to the connection method before discovering the recipient&#x27;s availability state. Conversely, Presence shows the availability state before a conversation is initiated. A similar comparison might be the requester needing to know if the recipient is at work. The most straightforward way of checking if the recipient is available is to walk to the desk, which requires the commitment of the walk regardless of the outcome and usually requires some interaction if the recipient is at the desk. The requester can call first to save the walk, but now must commit to an interaction via phone. Presence gives the state of the recipient to the requester and the requester has the choice to interact with the recipient or use that information for non-interactive purposes (such as taking roll).

==MPOP and presence by observation==
Presence becomes interesting for communication systems when it spans a number of different communication channels. The idea that multiple communication devices can combine state, to provide an aggregated view of a user&#x27;s presence has been termed Multiple Points of Presence (MPOP). MPOP becomes even more powerful when it is automatically inferred from passive observation of a user&#x27;s actions. This idea is already familiar to instant messaging users who have their status set to &quot;Away&quot; (or equivalent) if their computer keyboard is inactive for some time. Extension to other devices could include whether the user&#x27;s cell phone is on, whether they are logged into their computer, or perhaps checking their electronic calendar to see if they are in a meeting or on vacation. For example, if a user&#x27;s calendar was marked as out of office and their cell phone was on, they might be considered in a &quot;Roaming&quot; state.

MPOP status can then be used to automatically direct incoming messages across all contributing devices. For example, &quot;Out of office&quot; might translate to a system directing all messages and calls to the user&#x27;s cell phone. The status &quot;Do not disturb&quot; might automatically save all messages for later and send all phone calls to voicemail.

XMPP, discussed below, allows for MPOP by assigning each client a &quot;resource&quot; (a specific identifier) and a priority number for each resource. A message directed to the user&#x27;s ID would go to the resource with highest priority, although messaging a specific resource is possible by using the form user@domain/resource.

==Privacy concerns==

Presence is highly sensitive information and in non-trivial systems a presentity may define limits to which its presence information may be revealed to different watchers. For example, a worker may only want colleagues to see detailed presence information during office hours. Basic versions of this idea are already common in instant messaging clients as a &quot;Blocking&quot; facility, where users can appear as unavailable to selected watchers.

==Commercial products==
Presence, particularly MPOP, requires collaboration between a number of electronic devices (for example IM client, home phone, cell phone, and electronic calendar) and the presence services each of them are connected with. To date, the most common and wide-scale implementations use closed systems, with a SPOP (Single Point of Presence, where a single device publishes state). Some vendors have upgraded their services to automatically log out connected clients when a new login request reaches the server from a newly connecting different device. For presence to universally work with MPOP support, multiple devices must be able to not only intercommunicate among each other, the status information must also be appropriately handled by all other interoperable, connected presence services and the MPOP scheme for their clients.

2.5G and, even more so, 3G cell phone networks can support management and access of presence information services for mobile users cell phone handsets.

In the workplace, private messaging servers offer the possibility of MPOP within a company or work team.

==In the business community==
Presence information is a growing tool towards more effective and efficient communication within a business setting. Presence information allows you to instantly see who is available in your corporate network, giving more flexibility to set up short-term meetings and conference calls. The result is precise communication that all but eliminates the inefficiency of phone tag or email messaging. An example of the time-saving aspect of presence information is a driver with a GPS; he/she can be tracked and sent messages on upcoming traffic patterns that, in return, save time and money.

According to IDC surveys, employees &quot;often feel that IM gives their workdays the kind of &#x27;flow&#x27; that they feel when sitting directly among their colleagues, being able to ask questions of them, and getting the kind of quick responses that allow them to drive on to the next task&quot;. This phenomenon has been called the &quot;Presence Effect&quot; in contrast to its predecessor the &quot;water cooler&quot; effect, whereby this level of flow was only thought to be achieved in person.

With presence information, privacy of the users can become an issue. For example, when an employee is on his/her day off they are still connected to the network and have greater ability to be tracked down. Therefore, a concern of presence information is to determine how far the companies want to go with staying connected.

==Presence standardization efforts==
There was, and still is, significant work done in several working groups on achieving a standardization for presence-related protocols.

In 1999, a group called the Instant Message and Presence Protocol (IMPP) working group (WG), was formed within the Internet Engineering Task Force organization (IETF) in order to develop protocols and data formats for simple presence and instant messaging services. Unfortunately, IMPP WG was not able to come to consensus on a single protocol for presence. Instead it issued a common profile for presence and instant messaging (CPP) which defined semantics for common services of presence to facilitate the creation of gateways between presence services. Thus any two CPP-compatible presence protocol suites are automatically interoperable.

In 2001, the SIMPLE working group was formed within IETF to develop a suite of CPP-compliant standards for presence and instant messaging applications over the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The SIMPLE activity specifies extensions to the SIP protocol which deal with a publish and subscribe mechanism for presence information and sending instant messages. These extensions include rich presence document formats, privacy control, &quot;partial publications&quot; and notifications, past and future presence, watcher information and more. Despite its name, SIMPLE is far from simple. It is described in about 30 documents on more than 1,000 pages. This is in addition to the complexity of the SIP protocol stack on which SIMPLE is based.

At the end of 2001, Nokia, Motorola, and Ericsson formed the Wireless Village (WV) initiative to define a set of universal specifications for mobile Instant Messaging and Presence Services (IMPS) and presence services for wireless networks. In October 2002, Wireless Village was consolidated into the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) and a month later released the first version of
the XML-based OMA Instant Messaging and Presence Service (IMPS). IMPS defines a system architecture, syntax, and semantics for representation of presence information and a set of protocols for the four primary features: presence, IM, groups, and shared content. Presence is the key, enabling technology for the IMPS.

The XML-based XMPP or Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol was designed and is currently maintained by the XMPP Standards Foundation. This IM protocol, which is a robust and widely extended protocol, is also the protocol used in the commercial implementation of Google Talk and Facebook Chat. In October 2004, the XMPP working group at IETF published the documents RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922 and RFC 3923, to standardize the core XMPP protocol.

<text>The Third Division South of the Football League was a tier in the English football league system from 1921 to 1958. It ran in parallel with the Third Division North with clubs elected to the League or relegated from Division Two allocated to one or the other according to geographical position. Some clubs in the English Midlands shuttled between the Third Division South and the Third Division North according to the composition of the two leagues in any one season.

This division was created in 1921 from the Third Division, formed one year earlier when the Football League absorbed the leading clubs from the Southern League.

In 1921, a Northern section was also created called the Third Division North. The Third Division South was formed from the original 22 teams in the Third Division, with the exceptions of Crystal Palace, who were promoted to the Second Division, Grimsby Town who were transferred to the Third Division North, and Aberdare Athletic and Charlton Athletic who joined The Football League for the first time. Several Midlands-based teams were included in the Third Division South from time to time, although most were geographically closer to their Northern division rivals; Nottingham Forest and Notts County played in the Southern division although nearby Derby County spent time in the Northern division.

For the 1950–51 season the division was expanded to 24 clubs, with Colchester United and Gillingham joining.

Only one promotion place was available each season from the Third Division South to the Second Division, which made it very difficult to win promotion. Six teams, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Exeter City, Northampton Town, Southend United, Swindon Town, and Watford, were ever-present in the division for the 30 years of its existence. Of the teams that played in the Third Division South, Portsmouth, Ipswich Town, and Nottingham Forest were later English football champions.

Its final season was 1957–58, after which the North and South sections were merged to form a single Third Division and a new Fourth Division. The top 12 clubs in Division Three South, except for the Champions Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, went into the new Third Division, and the bottom 12 clubs went into the Fourth Division. 

==Tournaments between Third Division South and North==

From 1934 to the war&#x27;s outbreak, there was a short-lived knockout competition Football League Third Division South Cup.

From the 1954–55 season until the 1957–58 season, there was a series of games between teams representing the Third Division North and the Third Division South.

<text>Orochs (Russian &quot;О́рочи&quot;), Orochons, or Orochis (self-designation: &quot;Nani&quot;) are a people of Russia that speak the Oroch (&quot;Orochon&quot;) language of the Southern group of Tungusic languages. According to the 2002 census there were 686 Orochs in Russia. According to the 2010 census there were 596 Orochs in Russia.

Orochs traditionally settled in the southern part of the Khabarovsk Krai, Russia and on the Amur and Kopp rivers. In the 19th century, some of them migrated to Sakhalin. In the early 1930s, the Orochi National District was created, but was cancelled shortly thereafter &quot;due to lack of native population&quot;.

Because the people never had a written language, they were educated in Russian. Their language, Oroch, is on the verge of extinction; According to the 2021 census there are only about 43 native speakers of the language. They follow Shamanism and Russian Orthodox Church.

== History ==
Between 1963 and 1993, major changes took place in Oroch families:
* Almost all Orochi marriages became inter-ethnic - in 1951-1955, 73% of Orochi marriages were mono-ethnic, and in 1991-1995 only 9%.
* The share of Oroch-Russian marriages increased sharply from 9% in 1951-1955 to 82% in 1991-1995.
* The maximum size of an Oroch family decreased from 10 to 7 people from 1963 to 1993.
* The average family size of the Orochi in 1993 was 2.9 people, compared to 4.8 in 1963.

<doc id="580936" wikidata="Q242715" url="?curid=580936" title="Sulfur trioxide">
<text>Sulfur trioxide (alternative spelling sulphur trioxide) is the chemical compound with the formula SO3. It has been described as &quot;unquestionably the most [economically] important sulfur oxide&quot;. It is prepared on an industrial scale as a precursor to sulfuric acid.

Sulfur trioxide exists in several forms: gaseous monomer, crystalline trimer, and solid polymer. Sulfur trioxide is a solid at just below room temperature with a relatively narrow liquid range. Gaseous SO3 is the primary precursor to acid rain.

==Molecular structure and bonding==
===Monomer===
The molecule SO3 is trigonal planar. As predicted by VSEPR theory, its structure belongs to the D3h point group. The sulfur atom has an oxidation state of +6 and may be assigned a formal charge value as low as 0 (if all three sulfur-oxygen bonds are assumed to be double bonds) or as high as +2 (if the Octet Rule is assumed). When the formal charge is non-zero, the S-O bonding is assumed to be delocalized. In any case the three S-O bond lengths are equal to one another, at 1.42 Å. The electrical dipole moment of gaseous sulfur trioxide is zero.
===Trimer===
Both liquid and gaseous SO3 exists in an equilibrium between the monomer and the cyclic trimer. The nature of solid SO3 is complex and at least 3 polymorphs are known, with conversion between them being dependent on traces of water.

Absolutely pure SO3 freezes at 16.8 °C to give the &quot;γ&quot;-SO3 form, which adopts the cyclic trimer configuration [S(=O)2(&quot;μ&quot;-O)]3.

===Polymer===


If SO3 is condensed above 27 °C, then &quot;α&quot;-SO3 forms, which has a melting point of 62.3 °C. &quot;α&quot;-SO3 is fibrous in appearance. Structurally, it is the polymer [S(=O)2(&quot;μ&quot;-O)]&quot;n&quot;. Each end of the polymer is terminated with OH groups. &quot;β&quot;-SO3, like the alpha form, is fibrous but of different molecular weight, consisting of an hydroxyl-capped polymer, but melts at 32.5 °C. Both the gamma and the beta forms are metastable, eventually converting to the stable alpha form if left standing for sufficient time. This conversion is caused by traces of water.

Relative vapor pressures of solid SO3 are alpha &lt; beta &lt; gamma at identical temperatures, indicative of their relative molecular weights. Liquid sulfur trioxide has a vapor pressure consistent with the gamma form. Thus heating a crystal of &quot;α&quot;-SO3 to its melting point results in a sudden increase in vapor pressure, which can be forceful enough to shatter a glass vessel in which it is heated. This effect is known as the &quot;alpha explosion&quot;.

==Chemical reactions==
Sulfur trioxide undergoes many reactions.
===Hydration and hydrofluorination===
SO3 is the anhydride of H2SO4. Thus, it is susceptible to hydration:
:SO3 + H2O → H2SO4(Δf&quot;H&quot; = −200 kJ/mol)

Gaseous sulfur trioxide fumes profusely even in a relatively dry atmosphere owing to formation of a sulfuric acid mist.
SO3 is aggressively hygroscopic. The heat of hydration is sufficient that mixtures of SO3 and wood or cotton can ignite. In such cases, SO3 dehydrates these carbohydrates.

Akin to the behavior of H2O, hydrogen fluoride adds to give fluorosulfuric acid:
:SO3 + HF → FSO3H

===Deoxygenation===
SO3 reacts with dinitrogen pentoxide to give the nitronium salt of pyrosulfate:
:2 SO3 + N2O5 → [NO2]2S2O7

===Oxidant===
Sulfur trioxide is an oxidant. It oxidizes sulfur dichloride to thionyl chloride.
:SO3 + SCl2 → SOCl2 + SO2

===Lewis acid===
SO3 is a strong Lewis acid readily forming adducts with Lewis bases. With pyridine, it gives the sulfur trioxide pyridine complex. Related adducts form from dioxane and trimethylamine.

===Sulfonating agent===
Sulfur trioxide is a potent sulfonating agent, i.e. it adds SO3 groups to substrates. Often the substrates are organic, as in aromatic sulfonation. For activated substrates, Lewis base adducts of sulfur trioxide are effective sulfonating agents.

==Preparation==
The direct oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide in air proceeds very slowly:

: 2 SO2 + O2 → 2 SO3(Δ&quot;H&quot; = −198.4 kJ/mol)

===Industrial===
Industrially SO3 is made by the contact process. Sulfur dioxide is produced by the burning of sulfur or iron pyrite (a sulfide ore of iron). After being purified by electrostatic precipitation, the SO2 is then oxidised by atmospheric oxygen at between 400 and 600 °C over a catalyst. A typical catalyst consists of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) activated with potassium oxide K2O on kieselguhr or silica support. Platinum also works very well but is too expensive and is poisoned (rendered ineffective) much more easily by impurities.
The majority of sulfur trioxide made in this way is converted into sulfuric acid.

===Laboratory===
Sulfur trioxide can be prepared in the laboratory by the two-stage pyrolysis of sodium bisulfate. Sodium pyrosulfate is an intermediate product:

#Dehydration at 315 °C:
#: 2 NaHSO4 → Na2S2O7 + H2O
#Cracking at 460 °C:
#: Na2S2O7 → Na2SO4 + SO3

The latter occurs at much lower temperatures (45–60 °C) in the presence of catalytic H2SO4. In contrast, KHSO4 undergoes the same reactions at a higher temperature.

Another two step method involving a salt pyrolysis starts with concentrated sulfuric acid and anhydrous tin tetrachloride:

# Reaction between tin tetrachloride and sulfuric acid in a 1:2 molar mixture at near reflux (114 °C):
#: SnCl4 + 2 H2SO4 → Sn(SO4)2 + 4 HCl
# Pyrolysis of anhydrous tin(IV) sulfate at 150 °C - 200 °C:
#:Sn(SO4)2 → SnO2 + 2 SO3

The advantage of this method over the sodium bisulfate one is that it requires much lower temperatures and can be done using normal borosilicate laboratory glassware without the risk of shattering. A disadvantage is that it generates significant quantities of hydrogen chloride gas which needs to be captured as well.

SO3 may also be prepared by dehydrating sulfuric acid with phosphorus pentoxide.

==Applications==
Sulfur trioxide is a reagent in sulfonation reactions. Dimethyl sulfate is produced commercially by the reaction of dimethyl ether with sulfur trioxide:

Sulfate esters are used as detergents, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. Sulfur trioxide is generated in situ from sulfuric acid or is used as a solution in the acid.

B2O3 stabilized sulfur trioxide was traded by Baker &amp; Adamson under the tradename &quot;Sulfan&quot; in the 20th century.

==Safety==
Along with being an oxidizing agent, sulfur trioxide is highly corrosive. It reacts violently with water to produce highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

<doc id="580939" wikidata="Q62310" url="?curid=580939" title="Senta Berger">
<text>Senta Verhoeven (née Berger; , ; born 13 May 1941) is an Austrian-German actress. She received many award nominations for her acting in theatre, film, and television; her awards include three Bambi Awards, two Romys, an Adolf Grimme Award, both a Deutscher and a Bayerischer Fernsehpreis, and a Goldene Kamera.

== Early life ==
Berger was born in Hietzing, Vienna, to musician (1902–1983) and teacher Therese Jany. She first appeared on stage at the age of four, when her father accompanied her singing on the piano. At the age of five, she started ballet lessons.

Berger also took private acting lessons. In 1957, she won her first small role in &quot;The Unexcused Hour&quot;, one of the final films directed by Austrian &quot;auteur&quot; Willi Forst. She applied for the Max Reinhardt Seminar, a famous acting school in Vienna, and was accepted, but she left shortly afterwards after accepting a film role without permission. In 1958, she became the youngest member of the Josefstadt Theatre in Vienna and appeared in productions of &quot;L&#x27;Œuf&quot;, &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;&#x27; and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;.

==Career==
In 1960, Bernhard Wicki and Artur Brauner produced the comedy film &quot;The Good Soldier Schweik&quot; with Berger and German actor Heinz Rühmann. Brauner used Berger in several films, but she soon tired of musicals. In 1962, she went to Hollywood and worked with stars such as Charlton Heston, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Richard Widmark, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, and Yul Brynner. She returned to Germany to accept an offer for a role in a series, which would have included an obligation of several years. Early publicity material compared her to Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren.

In 1963, Berger met Michael Verhoeven, son of German film director Paul Verhoeven (not to be confused with the Netherlands Paul Verhoeven). In November 1964, she guest-starred in an episode of the U.S. television show &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E&quot;, entitled &quot;The Double Affair&quot;. It was later expanded and released in cinemas as the feature film &quot;The Spy with My Face&quot; (1965). Also in 1965, she starred in &quot;The Glory Guys&quot;, a dramatic representation of Custer&#x27;s Little Big Horn disaster, based on the novel &quot;The Dice of God&quot; by Hoffman Birney. Filmed by Levy-Gardner-Laven and released by United Artists, it stars Tom Tryon, Harve Presnell, Senta Berger, James Caan, and Michael Anderson, Jr. Berger and Verhoeven started their own film production company in 1965, and married in 1966. Berger continued to develop her European career in France and Italy.

In 1966, Berger co-starred with Kirk Douglas in the film &quot;Cast a Giant Shadow&quot;. Berger played the role of Magda, a soldier in the Israeli army during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Also in 1966, the British film &quot;Our Man in Marrakesh&quot;, called &quot;Bang, Bang, You&#x27;re Dead&quot; in the U.S., was released, starring Senta Berger opposite Tony Randall. In &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot;, a third film of hers released in 1966, she played opposite Max von Sydow and George Segal in the role of a German schoolteacher involved in neo-Nazi activity. In 1967, Berger acted in the pilot film for the Robert Wagner television series &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, which aired on the U.S. television network ABC on 9 January 1968. She reprised her role in the series in October 1969, in an episode in which her character was killed.

In 1970, Berger starred for the first time in a film produced by her own company and directed by her husband. Other internationally successful films made by their joint production company included, &quot;Die weiße Rose&quot; (1982), &quot;The Nasty Girl&quot; (1990) and &quot;&quot; (1995). In 1971, Berger participated in the media campaign &quot;We&#x27;ve had abortions!&quot; launched by German feminist Alice Schwarzer with a cover story in the &quot;Stern&quot; political magazine. In 1972, she also campaigned for Willy Brandt&#x27;s Social Democratic Party. 

Following the birth of her first son, Berger soon returned to theatre work. She played at the Burgtheater in Vienna, at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg, and at the Schiller Theater in Berlin. Between 1974 and 1982, she played the Buhlschaft in the play &quot;Jedermann&quot; at the Salzburg Festival with Curd Jürgens and Maximilian Schell. She also acted alongside Schell and James Coburn in a supporting role in the acclaimed war film &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1977). In 1977, she was head of the jury at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival. Twenty-one years later, she was part of the jury at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 1985–86, Berger started a comeback in front of German-speaking audiences in the TV serial &quot;Kir Royal&quot;. (In the 1980s, Berger discovered she was admired by Scottish drifter Arthur Richard Jackson, who had attempted to murder American actress Theresa Saldana in 1982.) Further serial hits followed, including &quot;Die schnelle Gerdi&quot; (&quot;The Fast Gerdi&quot;, 1989–2002), wherein she played a taxi driver. In the same year, she also started a career as a singer of chansons. From 2003 to 2010, Berger was president of the German Film Academy, which seeks to support the careers of actors and actresses in Germany and across Europe. Since 2005, the academy assigns the annual German Film Awards, or &quot;Lolas&quot;.

In 2005 she appeared in the film, &quot;Einmal so wie ich will&quot; (&quot;Once According to My Will&quot;), as a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage, who finds love on holiday, but turns her back on the relationship. In 2016, she played one of the leading roles in the film &quot;Welcome to Germany&quot;, written and directed by her son Simon Verhoeven. The film grossed more than US$20 million, making it the most successful German picture of the year. It also won numerous awards, among them the Deutscher Filmpreis, the peace award Friedenspreis des deutschen Films, and was nominated for a European Film Award for Best Comedy.

She played the role of Doctor Eva Maria Prohacek in the popular German crime television series &quot;Unter Verdacht&quot; (&quot;Under Suspicion&quot;) from 2002 till March 2020, when she retired from the role.

In June 2023, her romantic dramedy &quot;&quot; (&quot;Weißt du noch&quot;; screenplay by Martin Rauhaus, directed by Rainer Kaufmann) premiered at the 40th Filmfest München.

==Memoirs==
In the spring of 2006, Berger&#x27;s autobiography was published in Germany: &quot;Ich habe ja gewußt, daß ich fliegen kann&quot; (&quot;I Knew that I Could Fly&quot;). Among her memories of Hollywood are a less-than-subtle attempt by Darryl Zanuck to get her on his casting couch, and of all the shallow people she met in Hollywood.

==Personal life==

Berger was married to German film director Michael Verhoeven from 1966 until his death in 2024; their sons are actor-director Simon Verhoeven (born 1972) and actor/producer Luca Verhoeven (born 1979). She lives in Germany. She is Jewish.

<doc id="580944" wikidata="Q1112748" url="?curid=580944" title="Platte Purchase">
<text>The Platte Purchase was a land acquisition in 1836 by the United States government from American Indian tribes of the region. It comprised lands along the east bank of the Missouri River and added to the northwest corner of the state of Missouri.

This expansion of the slave state of Missouri was in violation of the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which prohibited the extension of slavery in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36°30′ north, except within the boundaries of the state of Missouri, as defined at the time of the adoption of the Missouri Compromise. The area acquired was almost as large as the states of Delaware and Rhode Island combined, and extended Missouri westward along the river. St. Joseph, one of the main river ports of departure for the westward migration of American pioneers, was located in the new acquisition.

The region of the Platte Purchase includes the following modern counties within its bounds: Andrew (435 square miles, 1127 km2), Atchison (545 square miles, 1412 km2), Buchanan (410 square miles, 1062 km2), Holt (462 square miles, 1197 km2), Nodaway (877 square miles, 2271 km2), and Platte (420 square miles, 1088 km2). It also includes what are now the northwest suburbs of Kansas City, a small area of Kansas City proper, the cities of St. Joseph and Maryville, Missouri, as well as Kansas City International Airport and almost all of Missouri&#x27;s portion of Interstate 29, save the small portion which runs concurrently with Interstate 35 in Clay County.

==Purchase==
When Missouri entered the Union, its western border was established as 
&quot;a meridian line passing through the middle of the mouth of the Kansas river, where the same empties into the Missouri river, thence, from the point aforesaid north, along the said meridian line, to the intersection of the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the river Des Moines, making the said line correspond with the Indian boundary line.&quot;The purchase extended Missouri&#x27;s western border north of the Kansas River east along the Missouri River to 95°46′ west longitude.

Less than a year after the Indian Removal Act of 1830, by which the US was authorized to remove the Native American population, the Missouri General Assembly was petitioning Congress to more clearly define the border on the northwest corner of the state. The Legislature noted the boundary was not clear, and that the land was not surveyed, thus leading to settlers encroaching on the lands. The most spectacular example of encroachment was Joseph Robidoux, who had been operating an American Fur Company trading post at St. Joseph, Missouri since 1826.

On January 27, 1835, Senator Lewis F. Linn wrote John Dougherty, an Indian agent, to inquire about acquiring the land. Dougherty agreed, noting that the territory was preventing access to Missouri River shipping by Missouri residents east of the purchase line. According to an early 20th-century historian, Dougherty&#x27;s reputation among the Native Americans was that of the &quot;Controller of Fire-water&quot; from the Missouri River to the Columbia River.

The first tribes to give up their land were the Potawatomi, who ceded their land in the Treaty of Chicago. They agreed to this in 1833 but the treaty wasn&#x27;t finalized until 1835. The Potawatomi (about 1,000 to 2,000) moved north to a reservation in Pottawattamie County, Iowa (Council Bluffs, Iowa). They moved again 1837–1838 in the Potawatomi Trail of Death to Osawatomie, Kansas.

The formal application came in the summer of 1835 at a meeting on the Dawes farm near Liberty, Missouri. Andrew S. Hughes, the US Indian agent for the Sac and Fox tribes, presided over a meeting of Missouri residents who formally asked Congress to acquire the land. Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton introduced a bill to acquire the land and it was approved with little opposition in June 1836.

An agreement was reached on September 17, 1836, with the chiefs Mahaska and No Heart of the Ioway tribe and leaders of the combined Sac and Fox tribes in a ceremony at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. It was presided by William Clark, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, who was based in St. Louis. (He was one of the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.) Noted diplomat Jeffrey Deroine, a formerly enslaved man, served as an interpreter for this treaty.

The Senate approved the treaty on February 15, 1837. On March 28, 1837, President Martin Van Buren issued a proclamation supporting the annexation. In October 1837, the Missouri General Assembly accepted the land and placed it all initially in the newly created Platte County.

This addition increased the land area of what was already the largest state in the Union at the time (about 66,500 square miles (172,000 km2) to Virginia&#x27;s 65,000 square miles, which then included West Virginia). The acquisition challenged the Missouri Compromise of 1820 by expanding slavery into free territory north of the southern Missouri border with Arkansas (Parallel 36°30′ north), and the Indian Removal Act. It required a second relocation of tribes who had just been moved &quot;permanently&quot; west of the Missouri border, as part of the forced Indian removal policy of ethnic cleansing from lands wanted by whites.

The tribes were paid $7,500 for their land. The U.S. government was &quot;to provide agricultural implements, furnish livestock&quot;, and a host of other small items. The tribes agreed to move to reservations west of the Missouri River in what was to become Kansas and Nebraska. Furthermore, the U.S. government was to &quot;build five comfortable houses for each tribe, break up of land, fence of land, furnish a farmer, blacksmith, teacher, interpreter.&quot; The reservations are today known as the Iowa Reservation and the Sac and Fox Reservation. The tribes gave up 3.1 thousand square miles of land for reservations of 29 square miles combined (26 for the Sac and Fox and 3 for the Ioway).

Michigan entered the Union on July 4, 1836. By the time the Platte Purchase was finalized, Missouri remained the second biggest state.

==Settlement==
The U.S. Government set up a United States General Land Office in Plattsburg, Missouri to handle the settlement. Much of the land was dispensed as military land warrants to veterans of the War of 1812 (and later Mexican–American War). Under the terms of the program, which was expanded in 1855, the 160-acre land grants could be given to military descendants and those grants could be sold.

Initial settlement was concentrated in the Town of Barry in south Platte County. Almost overnight, Platte County became the second-largest county in the state, and Weston, Missouri (&quot;West Town&quot;) was second only to St. Louis, Missouri in the state. St. Joseph would subsequently become the second-largest city in the state in the early settlement days. Since the purchase opened up a new slave area, the area was settled primarily by slaveholders from the Upper South: Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky. They brought enslaved African Americans with them or purchased them at slave markets, to work such Southern commodity crops as the labor-intensive hemp and tobacco. These were grown in the southern portion of the purchase, where farms and plantations had access to the Missouri River for shipping to market. The northern portion of the purchase attracted fewer Southerners and slaveholding was rare.

Today the Platte Purchase area is among the most rural areas in Missouri. St. Joseph and Maryville, Missouri are the only communities totally within the purchase area that have populations greater than 10,000. Kansas City, Missouri has influenced the area, expanding its boundaries into southern Platte County.

<doc id="580959" wikidata="Q1535598" url="?curid=580959" title="Write-only memory (joke)">
<text>Write-only memory (WOM), the opposite of read-only memory (ROM), began as a humorous reference to a memory device that could be written to but not read, as there seemed to be no practical use for a memory circuit from which data could not be retrieved. However, it was eventually recognized that write-only memory also describes certain functionalities in microprocessor systems. The concept is still often used as a joke or euphemism for a failed memory device.

The first use of the term is generally attributed to Signetics, whose &quot;write-only memory&quot; literature, created in 1972 as in-house practical joke, is frequently referenced within the electronics industry, a staple of software engineering lexicons, and included in &quot;best hoaxes&quot; collections.

==Signetics==
A &quot;Write-Only Memory&quot; datasheet was created &quot;as a lark&quot; by Signetics engineer John G &quot;Jack&quot; Curtis, inspired by a fictitious and humorous vacuum tube datasheet from the 1940s. Considered &quot;an icebreaker&quot;, it was deliberately included in the Signetics catalog.

Roy L Twitty, a Signetics PR representative, released a tongue-in-cheek press release touting WOM on April 1, 1973. Instead of the more conventional characteristic curves, the 25120 &quot;fully encoded, 9046×N, Random Access, write-only-memory&quot; data sheet included meaningless diagrams of &quot;bit capacity vs. Temp.&quot;, &quot;Iff vs. Vff&quot;, &quot;Number of pins remaining vs. number of socket insertions&quot;, and &quot;AQL vs. selling price&quot;. The fictional device required a 6.3 VAC Vff (vacuum tube filament) supply, a +10 Vcc (double the Vcc of standard TTL logic of the day), and Vdd of 0±2% volt (i.e. ground). It was specified to run between 0 and −70 °C.

==Apple==
In 1982, Apple published their official &quot;Apple IIe Reference Manual&quot; (part number A2L2005), which included two references to write-only memory:

On page 233:
* &quot;bit bucket:&quot; The final resting place of all information; see &quot;write-only memory&quot;.

On page 250:
* &quot;write-only memory:&quot; A form of computer memory into which information can be stored but never, ever retrieved, developed under government contract in 1975 by Professor Homberg T. Farnsfarfle. Farnsfarfle&#x27;s original prototype, approximately one inch on each side, has so far been used to store more than 100 trillion words of surplus federal information. Farnsfarfle&#x27;s critics have denounced his project as a six-million-dollar boondoggle, but his defenders point out that this excess information would have cost more than 250 billion dollars to store in conventional media.

Originally written by Bruce Tognazzini, the write-only memory definition was not without its share of internal controversy. The second sentence originally read, &quot;Approximately one inch on each side, Farnsfarfle&#x27;s original prototype has so far been used...&quot; The editors insisted the original contained a misplaced modifier whereas Tognazzini was equally adamant that Farnsfarfle was a very small man. The editors won.

==Book==
The 1995 &quot;Computer Contradictionary&quot; book discusses EWOM, or Erasable Write-Only Memory (an analogy of EPROM), a memory copyrighted by IBM (Irish Business Machines), which allows the data to be written to and then erased, for memory re-use.

With the explosive growth of the amount of digital video data online and in private use, there emerged a common joke that video tapes and other analog video media were &quot;write only memory&quot;, as very little of it was still viewed.

==Other members of the family==

The 25120 WOM joined a family of equally useless, fictitious devices made before and since, including the dark bulb, dark-emitting diode, WAS gate, and Inoperational Amplifier; and earlier, the Umac 606 Infernal Anode Phantasatron and the Electrovoice Rearaxial Softspeaker. (The Phantastron is a real, if obsolete, circuit for generating precision sawtooth waves.)

<text>Velvet Goldmine is a 1998 musical drama film written and directed by Todd Haynes from a story by Haynes and James Lyons. It is set in Britain during the glam rock days of the early 1970s, and tells the story of fictional bisexual pop star Brian Slade, who faked his own death. The film was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival and won the award for the Best Artistic Contribution. Sandy Powell received a BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design. The film uses non-linear storytelling to achieve exposition while interweaving the vignettes of its various characters.

==Plot==
In 1984, British journalist Arthur Stuart is writing an article about the withdrawal from public life of 1970s glam rock star Brian Slade following a death hoax ten years earlier, and is interviewing those who had a part in the entertainer&#x27;s career. As each person recalls their thoughts, it becomes the introduction of the vignette for that particular segment in Slade&#x27;s personal and professional life.

Part of the story involves Stuart&#x27;s family&#x27;s reaction to his homosexuality, and how the gay and bisexual glam rock stars and music scene gave him the strength to come out. Rock shows, fashion, and rock journalism all play a role in showing the youth culture of 1970s Britain, as well as the gay culture of the time. At the beginning of his career, Slade is married to Mandy. When he comes to the United States, he seeks out American rock star Curt Wild and they become involved in each other&#x27;s lives. The vignettes show Wild and Slade becoming increasingly difficult to work with as they become more famous. They suffer breakdowns in their personal and professional relationships. Eventually, Slade&#x27;s career ends following the critical and fan backlash from his stage publicity stunt where he faked his own murder.

As he gets closer to the truth of where Slade is now, Stuart is suddenly told by his editor that the story is no longer of public interest and Stuart has been assigned to the Tommy Stone tour, which coincidentally is Brian Slade&#x27;s new identity. It is revealed that Stuart was also at the concert where Slade faked his death, and that after seeing Wild perform on another night, Wild and Stuart had a sexual encounter. Eventually, Stuart confronts Tommy Stone and once again encounters Wild, who casually passes on a piece of jewellery from Oscar Wilde.

==Production==
The film centers on Brian Slade, a bisexual and androgynous glam rock icon who was patterned after David Bowie, Bryan Ferry, Jobriath and Marc Bolan. Director Todd Haynes requested access to Bowie&#x27;s song catalogue along with a personal blessing to make the film, but Bowie refused, saying that he intended to make a similar film about the time. Ewan McGregor co-stars in the role of Curt Wild, a genre-defying performer who doesn&#x27;t back down from sex, nudity or drugs on or off stage and whose biographical details are based on Iggy Pop (who grew up in a Michigan trailer park) and Lou Reed (whose parents sent him to electroshock therapy to &#x27;cure&#x27; his homosexual feelings). Also featured are Christian Bale as the young glam rock fan and reporter Arthur Stuart and Toni Collette as Slade&#x27;s wife, Mandy, who is based on Bowie&#x27;s first wife, Angela. Eddie Izzard stars as Slade&#x27;s manager, Jerry Devine.

The tale strongly parallels Bowie&#x27;s relationships with Reed and Pop in the 1970s and 1980s. Brian Slade&#x27;s gradually overwhelming stage persona of &quot;Maxwell Demon&quot; and his backing band, &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;, resemble Bowie&#x27;s Ziggy Stardust persona and backing band the Spiders from Mars. As with Slade and Wild, Bowie produced records for and with, Pop and Reed. The band name &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; is taken from a song by Lou Reed&#x27;s early band, the Velvet Underground, which was taken from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch&#x27;s eponymous novel, which appeared on their first album. Maxwell Demon was the name of an early band of Brian Eno, a long-time Bowie associate, whose music is heard at various points in the film.

Haynes has said that the story is also about the love affair between America and Britain, New York City and London, in the way each music scene feeds off and influences each other. Little Richard is shown as an early influence on Brian Slade. Little Richard inspired the Beatles and Bowie, who in turn inspired many other bands. Little Richard has also been cited by Haynes as the inspiration for Jack Fairy.

The film is strongly influenced by the ideas and life of Oscar Wilde (seen in the film as a progenitor of glam rock), and refers to events in his life and quotes his work on dozens of occasions. Jean Genet (the subject of Haynes&#x27; previous film, &quot;Poison&quot;, and the putative inspiration for the title of Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;The Jean Genie&quot;) is referred to in imagery and also quoted in dialogue.

The film&#x27;s narrative structure is modelled on that of Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, in that the reporter Stuart tries to solve a mystery about Slade, travelling to interview Slade&#x27;s lovers and colleagues, whose recollections are shown in 1950s, 1960s and 1970s flashbacks.

David Bowie was ambivalent about &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; upon release. According to Bowie, &quot;When I saw the film I thought the best thing about it was the gay scenes. They were the only successful part of the film, frankly.&quot;

===Music===

Although the character of Brian Slade is based mainly on David Bowie, Bowie vetoed the proposal that his songs appear in the film. As producer of Lou Reed&#x27;s 1972 &quot;Transformer&quot; album, his backing vocals (mainly consisting of &quot;bum-bum-bum&quot;s and &quot;ooh-ooh&quot;s) can be heard on &quot;Satellite of Love&quot;. The finished soundtrack includes songs by glam rock and glam-influenced bands, past and present.

The English musicians who played under the name The Venus in Furs on the soundtrack were Radiohead&#x27;s Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood, Craig &quot;Clune&quot; McClune of David Gray&#x27;s band, Suede&#x27;s Bernard Butler, and Roxy Music&#x27;s Andy Mackay. The American musicians who played as Curt Wild&#x27;s Wylde Ratttz on the soundtrack were The Stooges&#x27; Ron Asheton, Sonic Youth&#x27;s Thurston Moore and Steve Shelley, Minutemen&#x27;s Mike Watt, Gumball&#x27;s Don Fleming, and Mark Arm of Mudhoney.

The soundtrack features new songs written for the film by Pulp, Shudder to Think and Grant Lee Buffalo, as well as many early glam rock compositions, covers and original versions. The Venus in Furs covers several Roxy Music songs with Thom Yorke channeling Bryan Ferry on vocals, Placebo covers T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Boy,&quot; Wylde Ratttz and Ewan McGregor cover The Stooges&#x27; &quot;T.V. Eye&quot; and &quot;Gimme Danger&quot;; Teenage Fanclub and Donna Matthews cover the New York Dolls&#x27; &quot;Personality Crisis&quot;. Lou Reed, Brian Eno, T. Rex, and Steve Harley songs from the period are also included. The album is rounded out by a piece of Carter Burwell&#x27;s score.

All three members of the band Placebo appeared in the film, with Brian Molko and Steve Hewitt playing members of the Flaming Creatures (Malcolm and Billy respectively) and Stefan Olsdal playing Polly Small&#x27;s bassist. Another member of the Flaming Creatures, Pearl, was played by Xavior (Paul Wilkinson), former lead singer of Romo band DexDexTer and later a keyboard player for Placebo and Rachel Stamp.

==Alternate versions==
The international cut of the film which premiered at Cannes runs 123 minutes, while the US cut released theatrically later that year by Miramax was re-edited and runs 118 minutes.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in the United Kingdom on 23 October 1998 and grossed over $700,000. It was released in the United States on 6 November 1998 in 85 venues, grossing $301,787 in its opening weekend and ranking sixteenth at the box office, and fifth among the week&#x27;s new releases. It would ultimately gross $1,053,788 in the United States and Canada and $4,313,644 worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 63% rating based on 51 reviews, with an average of 6.5/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; takes a visual and narrative approach befitting its larger-than-life subject, although it&#x27;s still disappointingly less than the sum of its parts&quot;. Metacritic reports a 65 out of 100 score based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Janet Maslin, having seen the film at the New York Film Festival, made it a &quot;NYT Critics&#x27; Pick,&quot; calling it a &quot;dazzlingly surreal&quot; rock version of &quot;&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; with an extraterrestrial Rosebud&quot; and saying it &quot;brilliantly reimagines the glam rock ‘70s as a brave new world of electrifying theatricality and sexual possibility, to the point where identifying precise figures in this neo-psychedelic landscape is almost beside the point. &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; tells a story the way operas do: blazing with exquisite yet abstract passions, and with quite a lot to look at on the side.&quot; According to Peter Travers, &quot;Haynes creates &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;...with a masturbatory fervor that demands dead-on details&quot; and &quot;fashions a structure out of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;&quot;; it&#x27;s a film that &quot;works best as a feast of sight and sound...re-creating an era as a gorgeous carnal dream...celebrat[ing] the art of the possible.&quot; In a less enthusiastic review, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two out of four stars and found its plot too discursive and confusingly assorted because of how it &quot;bogs down in the apparatus of the search for Slade&quot; by clumsily using scenes from &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. David Sterritt from &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote &quot;The music and camera work are dazzling, and the story has solid sociological insights into a fascinating pop-culture period.&quot;

In a retrospective review, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Jeremiah Kipp gave &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; four out of four stars and said that, although unsupportive critics may be &quot;terrified of a movie with so many ideas&quot;, the film successfully shows a &quot;melancholic ode to freedom, and those who fight for it through art&quot;, because of Haynes&#x27; detailed imagery and the cast&#x27;s &quot;expressive, soulful performances&quot;. Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that Haynes&#x27; appropriation of structural elements from &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is the film&#x27;s &quot;masterstroke&quot;, as it helps &quot;evoke the glam rock movement without destroying the all-important mystique that sustains it.&quot; Tobias argued that, like Haynes&#x27; Bob Dylan-inspired 2007 film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; deals with a famously enigmatic figure indirectly through allusion and imagery, and consequently succeeds more than a simpler biopic could.

In an interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, Jonathan Rhys Meyers criticized the decision to use a different actor to play Tommy Stone at the end of the film: &quot;... it&#x27;s very hard for the audience to get that, which I think, I&#x27;m not quite sure did we make the right move there. Because I would have preferred to play Tommy Stone myself. You would have got more of the connection.&quot;

==Home media==
Since its 1999 DVD release, the film has become a cult classic and has been described as having &quot;an obsessive following among younger audiences.&quot;
Haynes said in a 2007 interview, &quot;A film that had the hardest time, at least initially, was &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, and it&#x27;s the film that seems to mean the most to a lot of teenagers and young people, who are just obsessed with that movie. They&#x27;re exactly who I was thinking about when I made &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, but it just didn&#x27;t get to them the first time around.&quot;

A Blu-ray was released in Region A on 13 December 2011, and includes a newly recorded commentary track by Haynes and Vachon. In it, Haynes thanks the fansites for helping him compile the notes for the commentary.

The soundtrack to &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; was released on vinyl in 2019.

<text>Salvino D&#x27;Armato degli Armati of Florence is sometimes credited with the invention of eyeglasses in the 13th century, however it has been shown that this claim was a hoax, and that there was no member of the Armati family with that name at the time.
The earliest mention of Salvino degli Armati as the inventor of eyeglasses occurred in 1684. Ferdinando Leopoldo del Migliore (1628–1696) of Florence published a book, &quot;Firenze città noblissima illustrata&quot; (&quot;Florence, Most Noble City, illustrated&quot;). In this book, del Migliore claimed to own a burial register of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, which had recently been renovated. This register supposedly recorded Armati&#x27;s epitaph as follows:

&quot;Original&quot; : &quot;Qui diace Salvino d&#x27;Armato degl&#x27;Armati di Fir., Inventor degl&#x27;occhiali. Dio gli perdoni la peccata. Anno D. MCCCXVII&quot;

&quot;Translation&quot; : &quot;Here lies Salvino, son of Armato degli Armati of Florence, inventor of eyeglasses. May God forgive his sins. A.D. 1317.&quot;

Del Migliore never produced this burial register, and it has never been found. Del Migliore claimed that D&#x27;Armati&#x27;s tomb and its epitaph was obliterated during the church&#x27;s restoration.

In 1920, the Italian scholar Isidoro del Lungo (1841–1927) pointed out (1) that nowhere else had a &quot;Salvino degli Armati&quot; been credited with being the inventor of eyeglasses, (2) that in the 14th century, the epitaph would have read &quot;&quot;le&quot; peccata&quot;, not &quot;&quot;la&quot; peccata&quot;, and most importantly, (3) that the term &quot;inventor&quot; did not exist in the Florentine vernacular during the 14th century. Del Lungo also found that a &quot;Salvino degli Armati&quot; had died in 1340, but he had been a humble artisan who had never dealt with eyeglasses.

Lack of evidence did not discourage the spreading of this claim about Salvino degli Armati. In 1738, Domenico Maria Manni (1690–1788) of Florence published a book on the subject: &quot;Degli occhiali naso inventati da Salvino Armati, gentiluomo fiorentino. Trattato istorico&quot; (Historical Treatise on Eyeglasses, Invented by Salvino Armati, Florentine Gentleman). However, critics pointed out that it was impossible to reconcile a &quot;Salvino Armati&quot; with the known genealogy of the Armati family of Florence around 1286, the period when eyeglasses were invented.

Again, despite the lack of evidence, the historian Pasquale Villari composed and had posted in Florence in 1855 a plaque honoring Salvino degli Armati as the inventor of eyeglasses. (The plaque has since been removed.) Furthermore, between 1850 and 1900, a portrait head of Salvino degli Armati with a plaque containing his epitaph was mounted in the chapel of the Orlandini de Beccuto family of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore.

In the twentieth century, efforts were made to expose as a hoax the claim that Salvino degli Armati invented eyeglasses: The &quot;Dizionario enciclopedico italiano&quot; (1955), vol. 1, lists Salvino degli Armati together with an exposure of del Migliore&#x27;s false claim. Furthermore, Vasco Ronchi, an Italian physicist who specialized in optics, also published an article on the subject as did the American historian of science Edward Rosen and the Italian professor of ophthalmology Giuseppe Albertotti (1851–1936).

<text>α-Carotene (&quot;alpha&quot;-carotene) is a form of carotene with a β-ionone ring at one end and an α-ionone ring at the opposite end. It is the second most common form of carotene.

==Human physiology==
In American and Chinese adults, the mean concentration of serum α-carotene was 4.71 μg/dL. Including 4.22 μg/dL among men and 5.31 μg/dL among women.

==Dietary sources==
The following vegetables are rich in alpha-carotene:
* Yellow-orange vegetables: Carrots (the main source for U.S. adults), sweet potatoes, pumpkin, winter squash
* Dark-green vegetables: Broccoli, green beans, green peas, spinach, turnip greens, collards, leaf lettuce, avocado

==Research==
A 2018 meta-analysis found that both dietary and circulating α-carotene are associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. The highest circulating α-carotene category, compared to the lowest, correlated with a 32% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, while increased dietary α-carotene intake was linked to a 21% decrease in the risk of all-cause mortality.

<text>The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit is a 1956 American drama film starring Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones, with Fredric March, Lee J. Cobb, Keenan Wynn and Marisa Pavan in support. Based on the 1955 novel by Sloan Wilson, it was written and directed by Nunnally Johnson, and focuses on Tom Rath, a young World War II veteran trying to balance the pressures of his marriage to an ambitious wife and growing family with the demands of a career while dealing with ongoing after-effects of his war service and a new high-stress job.

The film was entered at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
Ten years after the end of World War II Tom Rath (Gregory Peck) is living in suburban Connecticut with his wife Betsy (Jennifer Jones) and three children. He is having difficulty supporting his family and his wife’s ambitions on his writer&#x27;s salary at a Manhattan nonprofit foundation. In addition to a troubled marriage, Tom is also dealing with post-traumatic stress syndrome in the form of frequent and disquieting flashbacks from his combat service as an Army captain in the European and Pacific theaters. These include actions where he killed men in combat (including, by accident, his best friend), and a brief affair with a young Italian girl named Maria (Marisa Pavan) while involved with Betsy.

When a hoped-for inheritance from Tom&#x27;s recently deceased grandmother turns out to have been depleted, leaving only her large and unsaleable estate, Betsy pressures Tom to seek a higher-paying job. Acting on a tip from a fellow train commuter, he applies for an opening in public relations at television network United Broadcasting Company (UBC). Asked to write his autobiography as part of the interview process, he defers in favor of a simple declaration that he wants the job, expects he can grow into it, and will be happy to answer any questions directly related to his application. His forthrightness catches the attention of founding network president Ralph Hopkins (Fredric March), who seeks his help in launching a national mental health campaign Hopkins holds dear. Hopkins is powerful and highly respected, but a workaholic whose success has been at the expense of his family life, leaving him estranged from his wife and rebellious daughter, who soon elopes with an unsuitable man. He is drawn to Tom’s frankness and physical traits that remind him of the beloved son he lost in World War II.

Tom is initially supervised by Bill Ogden (Henry Daniell), an oily micromanager and office politician who rejects Tom&#x27;s drafts of an important speech Hopkins intends to launch the campaign with, substituting his own platitude-filled draft of what Ogden thinks Hopkins wants to hear. Aware the impetus for that pitch came from Hopkins himself, and dangerously pressured by Ogden, Tom plans to play along and accept that draft, but, coaxed by Betsy, presents his original ideas to Hopkins instead. Hopkins is both stunned and intrigued by Tom&#x27;s incisive approach and naked candor, but their meeting at Hopkins&#x27; city suite is interrupted by the unwelcome news that his daughter has eloped. Deeply disturbed, Hopkins becomes reflective, and relates to Tom that his son &quot;did the right thing&quot; and refused a commission in World War II and was subsequently killed in action as an enlisted man. Hopkins now regrets having ignored his family and advises Tom not to make the same mistake.

Betsy abruptly sells the family&#x27;s modest suburban home and moves them into Tom&#x27;s late grandmother&#x27;s mansion, which she chides as &quot;Dragonwyck&quot;. Complications immediately ensue when Edward (Joseph Sweeney), the old woman&#x27;s longtime caretaker, claims that Tom&#x27;s grandmother had bequeathed him the estate. Judge Bernstein (Lee J. Cobb) intercedes and presents evidence which suggests that not only did Edward forge the bequest letter, but he also padded his bills, thus depleting the estate and accumulating a large fortune that he could not otherwise explain. The Raths are able to keep the house.

At his new job, Tom runs into elevator operator Caesar (Keenan Wynn), his sergeant in Italy. Caesar is married to the cousin of his Italian flame Maria, and tells Tom that Maria and her son by Tom are desperate for money in their still war-ravaged country. Tom has kept his affair and possible child a secret from Betsy, but, goaded that evening by her admonition to always tell the truth, he now tells her. Betsy reacts angrily and speeds away recklessly in the family car.

The following morning, South Bay police call to tell Tom that they have Betsy, who ran out of gas during her flight. Hopkins then calls to ask Tom to accompany him on a trip to California in support of the new campaign. Tom declines, saying that he just wants to &quot;work 9 to 5 and spend the rest of the time with my family&quot;, a decision Hopkins respectfully but ruefully accepts.

Tom retrieves Betsy and they reconcile. The couple then go to Judge Bernstein to set up a third-person conduit for sending funds to Tom&#x27;s son in Italy. They leave together, embrace, and kiss.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film, like the novel on which it was based, became hugely popular with the public.

Produced on a budget of $2,670,000 it grossed $4,350,000 in U.S. rentals alone in 1956.

===Theatrical reviews===
Contemporary reviews of the film were somewhat mixed. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared it &quot;a mature, fascinating and often quite tender and touching film.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;often seems episodic and it&#x27;s over-long,&quot; finding Johnson&#x27;s direction &quot;uneven&quot; and holding him &quot;responsible for the fact that the picture so determinedly misses the point of the book which made the flannel suit a symbol rather than just a garment.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;one of the most absorbing pictures of the year,&quot; with &quot;exceptionally fine&quot; acting. John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; thought the film was too long and suggested that the flashbacks should have been trimmed, concluding that &quot;if it were an old-fashioned serial, I&#x27;m sure we might have been able to tolerate it. In one massive dose, though, it&#x27;s just too damned much, and I think you&#x27;d be better off taking a tranquilizer pill than going through all this for the sake of escaping the world and its woes.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;As a sociological document, a particular view of the contemporary American middle-class scene, the film is uneasily fascinating. Otherwise, this is a characteristic best-seller adaptation, over-long, over-loaded with &#x27;production values&#x27;, padded out with flashbacks to the war years, and efficiently impersonal in its approach.&quot;

===Social critique===
Historian Robert Schultz argues that the film and the novel are cultural representations of what Adlai Stevenson had described in 1955 as a &quot;crisis in the western world&quot;, &quot;collectivism colliding with individualism,&quot; the collective demands of corporate organizations against traditional roles of spouse and parent. That increased corporate organization of society, Schultz notes, reduced white-collar workers&#x27; (represented by Tom Rath and the other gray-suited &quot;yes men&quot;) control over what they did and how they did it as they adapted to the &quot;organized system&quot; described and critiqued by contemporary social critics such as Paul Goodman, C. Wright Mills, and William H. Whyte.

<doc id="581005" wikidata="Q848375" url="?curid=581005" title="Implicit function theorem">
<text>In multivariable calculus, the implicit function theorem is a tool that allows relations to be converted to functions of several real variables. It does so by representing the relation as the graph of a function. There may not be a single function whose graph can represent the entire relation, but there may be such a function on a restriction of the domain of the relation. The implicit function theorem gives a sufficient condition to ensure that there is such a function.

More precisely, given a system of equations (often abbreviated into ), the theorem states that, under a mild condition on the partial derivatives (with respect to each ) at a point, the variables are differentiable functions of the in some neighborhood of the point. As these functions generally cannot be expressed in closed form, they are &quot;implicitly&quot; defined by the equations, and this motivated the name of the theorem.

In other words, under a mild condition on the partial derivatives, the set of zeros of a system of equations is locally the graph of a function.

== History ==
Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) is credited with the first rigorous form of the implicit function theorem. Ulisse Dini (1845–1918) generalized the real-variable version of the implicit function theorem to the context of functions of any number of real variables.

== First example ==

If we define the function , then the equation cuts out the unit circle as the level set . There is no way to represent the unit circle as the graph of a function of one variable because for each choice of , there are two choices of &quot;y&quot;, namely formula_1.

However, it is possible to represent &quot;part&quot; of the circle as the graph of a function of one variable. If we let formula_2 for , then the graph of provides the upper half of the circle. Similarly, if formula_3, then the graph of gives the lower half of the circle.

The purpose of the implicit function theorem is to tell us that functions like and almost always exist, even in situations where we cannot write down explicit formulas. It guarantees that and are differentiable, and it even works in situations where we do not have a formula for .

== Definitions ==
Let formula_4 be a continuously differentiable function. We think of formula_5 as the Cartesian product formula_6 and we write a point of this product as formula_7 Starting from the given function formula_8, our goal is to construct a function formula_9 whose graph formula_10 is precisely the set of all formula_11 such that formula_12.

As noted above, this may not always be possible. We will therefore fix a point formula_13 which satisfies formula_14, and we will ask for a formula_15 that works near the point formula_16. In other words, we want an open set formula_17 containing formula_18, an open set formula_19 containing formula_20, and a function formula_21 such that the graph of formula_15 satisfies the relation formula_23 on formula_24, and that no other points within formula_25 do so. In symbols,

formula_26

To state the implicit function theorem, we need the Jacobian matrix of formula_8, which is the matrix of the partial derivatives of formula_8. Abbreviating formula_29 to formula_16, the Jacobian matrix is

formula_31

where formula_32 is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables formula_33 and formula_34 is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables formula_35. The implicit function theorem says that if formula_34 is an invertible matrix, then there are formula_37, formula_38, and formula_15 as desired. Writing all the hypotheses together gives the following statement.

== Statement of the theorem ==
Let formula_4 be a continuously differentiable function, and let formula_5 have coordinates formula_11. Fix a point formula_43 with formula_44, where formula_45 is the zero vector. If the Jacobian matrix (this is the right-hand panel of the Jacobian matrix shown in the previous section):
formula_46
is invertible, then there exists an open set formula_17 containing formula_18 such that there exists a unique function formula_49 such that and Moreover, formula_15 is continuously differentiable and, denoting the left-hand panel of the Jacobian matrix shown in the previous section as:
formula_51
the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of formula_15 in formula_37 is given by the matrix product: 
formula_54

===Higher derivatives===
If, moreover, formula_8 is analytic or continuously differentiable formula_56 times in a neighborhood of formula_16, then one may choose formula_37 in order that the same holds true for formula_15 inside formula_37. In the analytic case, this is called the analytic implicit function theorem.

== Proof for 2D case ==
Suppose formula_61 is a continuously differentiable function defining a curve formula_62. Let formula_63 be a point on the curve. The statement of the theorem above can be rewritten for this simple case as follows:
Proof. Since formula_64 is differentiable we write the differential of formula_64 through partial derivatives:
formula_66

Since we are restricted to movement on the curve formula_67 and by assumption formula_68 around the point formula_63 (since formula_70 is continuous at formula_63 and formula_72). Therefore we have a first-order ordinary differential equation:
formula_73

Now we are looking for a solution to this ODE in an open interval around the point formula_63 for which, at every point in it, formula_75. Since formula_64 is continuously differentiable and from the assumption we have
formula_77

From this we know that formula_78 is continuous and bounded on both ends. From here we know that formula_79 is Lipschitz continuous in both formula_80 and formula_81. Therefore, by Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem, there exists unique formula_82 that is the solution to the given ODE with the initial conditions. Q.E.D.

== The circle example ==
Let us go back to the example of the unit circle. In this case &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot; = 1 and formula_83. The matrix of partial derivatives is just a 1 × 2 matrix, given by
formula_84

Thus, here, the in the statement of the theorem is just the number ; the linear map defined by it is invertible if and only if . By the implicit function theorem we see that we can locally write the circle in the form for all points where . For we run into trouble, as noted before. The implicit function theorem may still be applied to these two points, by writing as a function of , that is, formula_85; now the graph of the function will be formula_86, since where we have , and the conditions to locally express the function in this form are satisfied.

The implicit derivative of &quot;y&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot;, and that of &quot;x&quot; with respect to &quot;y&quot;, can be found by totally differentiating the implicit function formula_87 and equating to 0:
formula_88
giving
formula_89
and
formula_90

== Application: change of coordinates ==
Suppose we have an -dimensional space, parametrised by a set of coordinates formula_91. We can introduce a new coordinate system formula_92 by supplying m functions formula_93 each being continuously differentiable. These functions allow us to calculate the new coordinates formula_92 of a point, given the point&#x27;s old coordinates formula_91 using formula_96. One might want to verify if the opposite is possible: given coordinates formula_92, can we &#x27;go back&#x27; and calculate the same point&#x27;s original coordinates formula_91? The implicit function theorem will provide an answer to this question. The (new and old) coordinates formula_99 are related by &quot;f&quot; = 0, with
formula_100
Now the Jacobian matrix of &quot;f&quot; at a certain point (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) [ where formula_101 ] is given by
formula_102
where I&quot;m&quot; denotes the &quot;m&quot; × &quot;m&quot; identity matrix, and is the matrix of partial derivatives, evaluated at (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;). (In the above, these blocks were denoted by X and Y. As it happens, in this particular application of the theorem, neither matrix depends on &quot;a&quot;.) The implicit function theorem now states that we can locally express formula_91 as a function of formula_92 if &quot;J&quot; is invertible. Demanding &quot;J&quot; is invertible is equivalent to det &quot;J&quot; ≠ 0, thus we see that we can go back from the primed to the unprimed coordinates if the determinant of the Jacobian &quot;J&quot; is non-zero. This statement is also known as the inverse function theorem.

=== Example: polar coordinates ===
As a simple application of the above, consider the plane, parametrised by polar coordinates . We can go to a new coordinate system (cartesian coordinates) by defining functions and . This makes it possible given any point to find corresponding Cartesian coordinates . When can we go back and convert Cartesian into polar coordinates? By the previous example, it is sufficient to have , with
formula_105
Since , conversion back to polar coordinates is possible if . So it remains to check the case . It is easy to see that in case , our coordinate transformation is not invertible: at the origin, the value of θ is not well-defined.

== Generalizations ==

=== Banach space version ===
Based on the inverse function theorem in Banach spaces, it is possible to extend the implicit function theorem to Banach space valued mappings.

Let &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; be Banach spaces. Let the mapping be continuously Fréchet differentiable. If formula_106, formula_107, and formula_108 is a Banach space isomorphism from &quot;Y&quot; onto &quot;Z&quot;, then there exist neighbourhoods &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot;0 and &quot;V&quot; of &quot;y&quot;0 and a Fréchet differentiable function &quot;g&quot; : &quot;U&quot; → &quot;V&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) = 0 and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0 if and only if &quot;y&quot; = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), for all formula_109.

=== Implicit functions from non-differentiable functions ===
Various forms of the implicit function theorem exist for the case when the function &quot;f&quot; is not differentiable. It is standard that local strict monotonicity suffices in one dimension. The following more general form was proven by Kumagai based on an observation by Jittorntrum.

Consider a continuous function formula_110 such that formula_111. If there exist open neighbourhoods formula_112 and formula_113 of &quot;x&quot;0 and &quot;y&quot;0, respectively, such that, for all &quot;y&quot; in &quot;B&quot;, formula_114 is locally one-to-one, then there exist open neighbourhoods formula_115 and formula_116 of &quot;x&quot;0 and &quot;y&quot;0, such that, for all formula_117, the equation
&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0 has a unique solution
formula_118
where &quot;g&quot; is a continuous function from &quot;B&quot;0 into &quot;A&quot;0.

=== Collapsing manifolds ===
Perelman’s collapsing theorem for 3-manifolds, the capstone of his proof of Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture, can be understood as an extension of the implicit function theorem.

<text>The Ford GT is a mid-engine two-seater sports car manufactured and marketed by American automobile manufacturer Ford for the 2005 model year in conjunction with the company&#x27;s 2003 centenary. The second generation Ford GT became available for the 2017 model year.

The GT recalls Ford&#x27;s historically significant GT40, a consecutive four-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans (1966–1969), including a 1-2-3 finish in 1966.

==First generation (2005-2006)==
===Development===
The Ford GT began life as a concept car designed in anticipation of the automaker&#x27;s centennial year and as part of its drive to showcase and revive its &quot;heritage&quot; names such as Mustang and Thunderbird. At the 2002 North American International Auto Show, Ford unveiled a new GT40 Concept car. Camilo Pardo, the then head of Ford&#x27;s &quot;Living Legends&quot; studio, is credited as the chief designer of the GT and worked under the guidance of J Mays. Carroll Shelby, the original designer of the Shelby GT 500, was brought in by Ford to help develop the GT; which included performance testing of the prototype car. While under development, the project was called &quot;Petunia&quot;.

The GT is similar in outward appearance to the original GT40, but is bigger, wider, and most importantly taller than the original&#x27;s overall height; as a result, a potential name for the car was the GT44. Although the cars are visually related, structurally, there is no similarity between the modern GT and the 1960s GT40 that inspired it. After six weeks from the unveiling of the GT40 concept, Ford announced a limited production run of the car. Three pre-production cars were shown to the public in 2003 as part of Ford&#x27;s centenary celebrations, and delivery of the production version called simply the Ford GT began in the fall of 2004.

As the Ford GT was built as part of the company&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration, the left headlight cluster was designed to read &quot;100&quot;.

===Naming difficulties===
A British company, Safir Engineering, who built continuation GT40 cars in the 1980s, owned the &quot;GT40&quot; trademark at that time. When production of the continuation cars ended, they sold the excess parts, tooling, design, and trademark to a small Ohio based company called Safir GT40 Spares. This company licensed the use of the &quot;GT40&quot; trademark to Ford for the initial 2002 show car. When Ford decided to put the GT40 concept to production stage, negotiations between the two firms failed as Ford did not pay the US$40 million the owners of the name demanded. Thus, the production cars are simply called the GT.

=== Production ===
The GT was produced for the 2005 and 2006 model years. The car began assembly at Mayflower Vehicle Systems (MVS) in Norwalk, Ohio and was painted and continued assembly at Saleen Special Vehicles (SSV) facility in Troy, Michigan, through contract by Ford. The GT is powered by an engine built at Ford&#x27;s Romeo Engine Plant in Romeo, Michigan. Installation of the engine and transmission along with seats and interior finishing was handled in the SVT building at Ford&#x27;s Wixom, Michigan plant.

Of the 4,500 cars originally planned, approximately 100 were to be exported to Europe, starting in late 2005. An additional 200 cars were destined for sale in Canada. Production ended in September 2006 without reaching the planned production target. Approximately 550 cars were built in 2004, nearly 1,900 in 2005, and just over 1,600 in 2006, for a grand total of 4,038 cars. The final 11 car bodies manufactured by Mayflower Vehicle Systems were disassembled, and the frames and body panels were sold as service parts. The Wixom Assembly Plant has stopped production of all models as of May 31, 2007. Sales of the GT continued into 2007, from cars held in storage and in dealer inventories.

==== Heritage edition ====
Ford produced a total of 346 Heritage editions, recognizable by the Gulf Oil-inspired livery. The livery is in honor of the back to back wins of Ford at the 1968 and 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans by the GT40 Mk I.
=== Sales and marketing ===

When the Ford GT was first announced, the demand outpaced supply, and the cars initially sold for premium prices. The first private sale of Ford&#x27;s new mid-engine sports car was completed on August 4, 2004, when former Microsoft executive Jon Shirley took delivery of his Midnight Blue 2005 Ford GT. Shirley earned the right to purchase the first production Ford GT (chassis #10) at a charity auction at the Pebble Beach &quot;Concours d&#x27;Elegance&quot; Auction after bidding over US$557,000.

A few other early cars sold for as much as a US$100,000 premium over the suggested retail price of US$139,995. Optional equipment available included a McIntosh sound system, racing stripes, painted brake calipers, and BBS forged alloy wheels adding US$13,500 to the MSRP.

=== Performance and engineering ===
The Ford GT features many technologies unique at its time including a superplastic-formed frame, aluminum body panels, roll-bonded floor panels, a friction stir welded center tunnel, covered by a magnesium center console, a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; gas tank, a capless fuel filler system, one-piece panels, and an aluminum engine cover with a one-piece carbon fiber inner panel.

Brakes are four-piston aluminum Brembo calipers with cross-drilled and vented rotors at all four corners. When the rear canopy is opened, the rear suspension components and engine are visible.

The 5.4 L longitudinal rear mounted Modular V8 engine is an all-aluminum alloy engine with an Eaton 2300 Lysholm screw-type supercharger. It features a forged rotating assembly housed in an aluminum block designed specifically for the car. A dry sump oiling system is employed, allowing the engine to sit low in the car&#x27;s frame. The DOHC 4 valves per cylinder heads are a revision of the 2000 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra R cylinder heads (with slightly increased wall casting thickness in the exhaust port). The camshafts have unique specifications, with more lift and duration than those found in the Shelby GT500. Power output is at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm. A Ricardo 6-speed manual transmission is fitted featuring a helical limited-slip differential. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; tested the GT in January 2004 and recorded a 0- acceleration time of 3.3 seconds.
Performance:

*Top speed: 
*: 11.8 seconds
*: 3.8 seconds
*: 12.3 seconds
*: 44.3 seconds
===Fuel consumption===
The United States Environmental Protection Agency mileage estimate for the GT is in city driving, and in highway cruising, for a combined .

=== Standing mile speed record ===
Modified versions of the Ford GT have established several speed records, including the standing mile. One modified version broke the record for fastest street legal vehicle (the vehicle used in the record run is street legal and registered for road use in the U.S.A) achieved by a highly modified twin turbo version of the original 5.4-liter V8 rated at approximately with a top speed of at Space Florida launch and landing facility.

=== Ford GTX1 ===
The Ford GTX1 is an aftermarket roadster iteration of the Ford GT introduced by the company at the 2005 SEMA Show. The car was built by Mark Gerisch, owner of Genaddi Design Group from Green Bay, Wisconsin with assistance from Ford. Kip Ewing, a development engineer who had been involved in the development of the GT and conceived the idea, supervised the project. The resulting chassis is ten percent less stiff than the standard GT.

The design was inspired by the open top GT40 which was conceived in the 1960s. The car had a modified engine cover, modified doors (with roof portions removed) and a central removable roof bar. Two roof pieces could be installed and removed when the roof bar was installed making the car a T-top, a canvas roof panel would be installed when the roof bar was removed. The car had headrests inspired from the Porsche Carrera GT.

The car received a positive response at the show and customers urged Ford to build this version of the GT but the end of the production of the GT in the forthcoming year meant that it would be expensive to produce another limited variant of the car. The GTX1 was offered as a kit by the body shop adding US$38,000 to the price of a standard Ford GT. The involvement of Ford in the process meant that the warranty and other obligations on the car were unaltered.

A total of 100 orders for the GTX1 were received and completed over a two-year planned production period, these including the exact copies of the SEMA show car. Other modifications on the GTX1 included race seats, a customized interior, new Wilwood brakes, a hidden rear bumper and a maximum power increase to . The GTX1 was featured in various automotive publications along with several reviews.

A specialist Sony Xplod audio system was fitted to the GTX1.

==Second generation (2016–2022)==
At the 2015 North American International Auto Show and at the unveiling of the 2015 racing video game &quot;Forza Motorsport 6&quot;, the second-generation Ford GT was shown to the public with plans for production in 2016, after a decade-old hiatus from the first generation. The car marked 50 years since the GT40 won the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans and competed successfully in the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans to better celebrate the anniversary, winning the LM GTE-Pro class, taking 1st and 3rd in class.

=== Development ===
The development of the second generation GT at Ford was a very secretive operation–according to design director Chris Svensson, &quot;a handful of twelve people, including some key engineers, had access to the [design studio]&quot;. This secrecy was maintained inside Ford and to the press until its 2015 unveiling at the North American Auto Show.

The design of the new GT began with its aerodynamics package, which was closely related to the ultimate focus of the design team of creating a successful Le Mans race car. Low drag and aerodynamic efficiency were of primary importance in the development of the exterior of the car, and this drove designers to pursue a &#x27;teardrop profile&#x27; as often seen in LMP1 cars. The powertrain of the new GT, therefore, became a secondary criterion to the external design and aerodynamic performance of the car. Although a V8 and even a V12 engine were both considered, it was ultimately decided to use Ford&#x27;s EcoBoost V6 engine due to the degrees of freedom that the compact engine gave designers.

The intent behind the design was for the overall look of the second generation GT to be recognizable as a part of the GT line, which meant, for example, a cut back front nose piece, circular tail lights, and raised twin exhaust pipes. There was no explicit requirement for luxury or practicality in the design of the road car, which is the reason behind the car&#x27;s negligible cargo space and spartan interior. The interior seating position was fixed to provide additional space for the bodywork and teardrop exterior shape.

=== Overview ===
Like its predecessor, the new Ford GT is only offered as a 2-door coupe with the mid-rear layout, for the purpose of improved stability by keeping the center of gravity near the middle. The new GT&#x27;s weight distribution is 43% front and 57% rear. Unlike the first generation car, the new GT has butterfly doors that no longer include a piece integrated into the roof.

==== Powertrain ====
The car is powered by a twin-turbocharged Ford EcoBoost V6 engine rated at and of torque. For the 2020 model year and beyond, this power output rating was increased to . The engine shares many components with the F-150&#x27;s 3.5 L V6 engine including the cylinder heads, block and dual fuel system. Notable differences include larger turbochargers, an aluminum intake manifold, a custom dry sump lubrication system, unique camshafts and higher strength rotating and timing drive components.

The engine is paired to a Getrag &quot;7DCL750&quot; 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.

==== Chassis for 2020 ====
Underpinning the new GT is a carbon fiber monocoque bolted to aluminum front and rear subframes covered in carbon fiber body panels. The windshield of the vehicle is made of Gorilla Glass manufactured by Corning, which is also used for manufacturing smartphone screens. The Gorilla Glass is used to reduce the weight of the vehicle by allowing for a thinner windscreen with the same strength as a normal glass windscreen. The GT employs a four-stage external dry sump oil pump and has an oil capacity of .

==== Suspension ====
The new GT uses a pushrod suspension system, which move the primary components of the suspension inboard and provide space for the large aerodynamic elements in the bodywork of the car. The suspension is hydraulically adjustable, and the ride height can drop from in comfort mode to in Track or Vmax modes. These drive modes also dynamically adjust the dampening component of the suspension, which consists of two springs stacked in series. In Track and Vmax modes, one of these springs is completely locked to increase the overall spring rate of the system. The car also has a front-axle lifting system for clearing road obstacles and steep entry angles.

==== Wheels ====
The new GT is the second Ford vehicle to feature optional carbon fiber wheels, after the Shelby Mustang GT350R. In addition to improved strength and rigidity, these wheels weigh less than their forged aluminum counterparts. The wheels have a diameter of 20 inches at the front and rear, and come equipped with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires with codes of 245/35 R 20 for the front and 325/30 R 20 for the rear. The brakes are ventilated carbon-ceramic discs made by Brembo, with six-piston calipers at the front and four-piston calipers at the rear.

==== Aerodynamics ====
The most prominent exterior features of the new GT are the open airflow tunnels built into the rear fenders of the car, referred to as the &#x27;flying buttresses&#x27;. These large aerodynamic elements, enabled by the compact V6 engine and pushrod suspension design, channel air around the teardrop-shaped cockpit over the rear spoiler for increased downforce. The front end of the GT features a GT40-inspired cutaway nose and vents in the hood that pass oncoming air over the top of the car. The rear features a large diffuser and hollow circular tail lights that expel air taken in by vents built into the flying buttresses.

The active rear spoiler of the GT can adjust and adapt to different driving conditions and modes depending on how much downforce is needed. In Track mode, a gurney flap will extend from the trailing edge of the wing to further increase downforce, and the wing will flip vertical to help stop the car under heavy braking.

=== Performance ===
The new GT has a claimed top speed of , and has a power to weight ratio of per kilogram. In steady-state cornering on a skidpad, the GT can achieve 1.11 g of lateral acceleration, and the car is capable of braking from to a stop in . Independent acceleration figures are provided below.

At the Willow Springs International Raceway, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; test driver Randy Pobst achieved a hot lap time of 1:23.69 in a 2017 GT, which at the time made it the fourth-fastest road car tested between the 2015 Porsche 918 Spyder (1:23.54) and the 2017 Porsche 911 Turbo S (1:24.26). After suffering from mechanical issues during an earlier test by automotive magazine &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, racing driver Billy Johnson set a lap time around Virginia International Raceway of 2:38.62 in a 2017 GT. This places it third overall in Car and Driver&#x27;s testing history at the circuit, after the 2019 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 (2:37.3) and the 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS Weissach (2:37.8).

=== Production ===
Production began in December 2016 and is scheduled to continue through 2022, with a planned production rate of one car per day at Multimatic&#x27;s low-volume assembly facility in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Approximately two hundred 2017 and 2018 year production cars were recalled to fix potential hydraulic leaking and fire risk. The cars produced for the 2017 and 2018 model years are allocated through Ford Performance&#x27;s vehicle allocation process. The cars produced for the 2019 model year were primarily for buyers unsuccessful in the initial selection process, and the cars produced for the 2020 model year are for new customers.

==== 2020 model year update ====
For the 2020 model year, the Ford GT received an update that introduced several mechanical upgrades and new special editions. The 3.5 L EcoBoost V6 is now rated at due to gallery-cooled pistons and more powerful ignition coils. New engine tuning also results in a &#x27;broader torque band&#x27; according to Ford, although peak torque output remains unchanged. The updated GT also comes standard with a new titanium exhaust system developed by Akrapovič, which saves over the original exhaust. The suspension stiffness in Track mode has also been further increased, and cooling airflow into the flying buttresses has been improved by new vent design in this updated model.

==== Special editions ====

There have been number of special edition series for the new GT, often involving unique liveries, materials, or interior changes. These special editions include:

* Competition Series (2017–2018): The closest one can get to the car that won the 2016 Le Mans, with all optional carbon fiber parts fitted, with interior weight savings from deletion of A/C, radio hardware, and storage bins.
* &#x27;66 Heritage Edition (2017): Matte or metallic black paint with #2 graphics to honor the winning GT40 Mk II at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans.
* &#x27;67 Heritage Edition (2018): Race red paint with #1 graphics to honor the winning GT40 Mk IV at the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans.
* &#x27;68–&#x27;69 Heritage Edition (2019–2020): Blue and orange Gulf Oil livery with #9 (2019) or #6 (2020) graphics to honor the back to back wins at the 1968 and 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans by the GT40 Mk I.
*Liquid Carbon (2020): Exposed carbon fiber body and wheels for the 2020 model year, at an increased price of US$750,000.
*&#x27;66 Heritage Edition (2021): White, red, and carbon exterior with #98 graphics to honor the GT40 Mk II&#x27;s win at the 1966 24 Hours of Daytona.
* &#x27;64 Heritage Edition (2022): White with black accents to mimic the livery of the sole remaining GT40 prototype car, the 1964 GT/105.
* Alan Mann Heritage Edition (2022): Signature Alan Mann Racing livery in red and gold to tribute to Alan Mann Racing&#x27;s 1966 Ford GT lightweight experimental prototypes.
* Holman Moody Heritage Edition (2022): Gold and red livery to honor the podium-placing Holman Moody GT40 Mk II, chassis no. P/1016.
* LM Edition (2022): Painted in Liquid Silver with a choice of either red or blue accents, as tribute to the 2016 Le Mans-winning GT, which wore a red and blue livery.

=== GT Mk II ===
A track-day-only version of the new GT, named the GT Mk II, was launched on 4 July 2019 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. The name pays homage to the original GT40 Mk II race car that won the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans.

The GT Mk II features many substantial changes from the road car that increase its capabilities on the track. The 3.5 L EcoBoost V6 engine has been tuned and is rated at over , which is cooled by a roof-mounted air intake and new outboard-mounted intercoolers. The removal of the adjustable ride height system and the stripped-out interior reduces the overall weight of the Mk II by about over the road car. The active spoiler has been replaced by a much larger fixed wing, which in combination with a larger diffuser and new aerodynamic elements results in a 400% increase in downforce over the road car. The GT Mk II uses smaller 19-inch wheels and Michelin Pilot Sport GT slick racing tires, although it shares the GT&#x27;s carbon ceramic brakes.

As a result of these changes, the GT Mk II is not street legal. Only 45 will be built, and at a unit price of US$1.2 million it is the most expensive new Ford ever sold. The Mk II, however, is not sold by Ford but rather directly to customers by Multimatic, the Canadian manufacturer of all GT cars.

=== GT Mk IV ===
To commemorate Ford&#x27;s victory at the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ford and Multimatic built another track-only Ford GT inspired by the Ford GT40 Mk IV, priced at $1.7 million; the car targets more than 800 horsepower as a performance figure. 67 examples will be built by Ford as a final sendoff to the Ford GT.

==Racing==
===Overview===
The Ford GT has been campaigned in various racing venues. These include:
* A highly modified GT was raced in 2006 and 2007 in Super GT&#x27;s GT300 class in Japan powered by a 3.5 L Ford Zetec-R engine produced by Cosworth in the mid-1990s for Formula One.
* Matech Concepts from Switzerland entered three Ford GTs modified to GT3 class specifications in the FIA GT3 European Championship. Matech won the Teams title in the 2008 Championship. 
* Atlanta-based Robertson Racing entered a Doran-built Ford GT-R in the American Le Mans Series GT class (formerly GT2). The team made its first 24 Hours of Le Mans appearance in 2011, scoring 3rd position overall in the GTE Am Class.
* Black Swan Racing entered a Falken Tires-sponsored Ford GT-R in the GT2 class in the American Le Mans Series during the 2008 season.
* Ford Chip Ganassi Racing formerly ran 4 factory-supported LM-spec Ford GT LM GTE-Pro racecars. Two in the FIA World Endurance Championship under the LM GTE-Pro class during the 2016, 2017, &amp; 2018–19 seasons and two in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship in the GTLM class during the 2016, 2017, 2018, &amp; 2019 seasons. At the end of the 2019 season, Ganassi announced that it would end their factory race program with Ford after four years.

===First generation===

====Ford GT GT1====
The Ford GT GT1 is a racing version of the Ford GT developed by Matech Concepts to comply with FIA GT1 rules. The official race debut of the Ford GT1 coincided with the kick-off of the 2009 FIA GT Championship season in Silverstone. For the 2010 FIA GT1 World Championship season four cars were built and fielded by two teams: Matech Competition and Marc VDS Racing Team. Three cars competed in the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans race, with two (the number 70 car run by the Marc VDS Racing Team and the number 61 car run by Matech Concepts) retiring early on. The third car retired later in the race. For the 2011 FIA GT1 World Championship season, Matech left the series which left Marc VDS running the four cars during the season, two under the Marc VDS Racing Team name and the other two cars under the name of Belgian Racing.

====Ford GT GT3====
The Ford GT was also homologated for the FIA GT3 rules by Matech Concepts. The Ford GT GT3 was involved in numerous championships including the FIA GT3 European Championship, FIA GT1 World Championship, Blancpain Endurance Series, and others. The GT3 version is slower than the GT1 version (rated at around instead of ) and features different bodywork.

===Second generation===
====Ford GT LM GTE-Pro by Ford Chip Ganassi Racing====
On 12 June 2015, at Le Mans, it was announced that Ford will return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2016 with a factory-supported, four-car effort operating as Ford Chip Ganassi Racing with the LM-spec Ford GT LM GTE-Pro. The Ford Chip Ganassi Racing cars campaigned in both the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship and the FIA World Endurance Championship. The car debuted at the 2016 24 Hours of Daytona on January 30–31 finishing seventh and ninth in class.

On June 19, 2016, the #68 Ford GT of Ford Chip Ganassi Racing finished first at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the LM GTE-Pro class; the victory marked fifty years after Ford won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966, where they came first, second, and third with the GT40. In the 2016 6 Hours of Fuji and the 6 Hours of Shanghai, both the Ford GT&#x27;s finished 1–2 at both races, the #67 winning both and the #66 coming second in both.

In the opening WEC race at Silverstone, the #67 Ford GT took victory. Two races later, on June 19, 2017, the #67 Ford GT of Ford Chip Ganassi Racing finished runner up at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the LM GTE-Pro class; this time fifty years after the second Le Mans Race win in 1967.

<doc id="581018" wikidata="Q160152" url="?curid=581018" title="Chełmno extermination camp">
<text>Chełmno or Kulmhof was the first of Nazi Germany&#x27;s extermination camps and was situated north of Łódź, near the village of Chełmno nad Nerem. Following the invasion of Poland in 1939, Germany annexed the area into the new territory of Reichsgau Wartheland. The camp, which was specifically intended for no other purpose than mass murder, operated from , to , parallel to Operation Reinhard during the deadliest phase of the Holocaust, and again from , to , during the Soviet counter-offensive. In 1943, modifications were made to the camp&#x27;s killing methods as the reception building had already been dismantled.

At the very minimum, 152,000 people were murdered in the camp, which would make it the fifth deadliest extermination camp, after Auschwitz, Treblinka, Bełżec, and Sobibór. However, the West German prosecution, citing Nazi figures during the Chełmno trials of 1962–65, laid charges for at least 180,000 victims. The Polish official estimates, in the early postwar period, have suggested much higher numbers, up to a total of 340,000 men, women, and children. The gives the figure of around 200,000, the vast majority of whom were Jews of west-central Poland, along with Romani people from the region, as well as foreign Jews from Hungary, Bohemia and Moravia, Germany, Luxembourg, and Austria transported to Chełmno via the Łódź Ghetto, on top of the Soviet prisoners of war. The victims were murdered using gas vans. Chełmno was a place of early experimentation in the development of the Nazi extermination programme.

Red Army troops captured the town of Chełmno on . By then, the Germans had already destroyed evidence of the camp&#x27;s existence, leaving no prisoners behind. One of the camp survivors, who was fifteen years old at the time, testified that only three Jewish males had escaped successfully. The &quot;Holocaust Encyclopedia&quot; counted seven Jews who escaped; among them was the author of the Grojanowski Report, written under an assumed name by Szlama Ber Winer, a prisoner in the Jewish &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; who escaped only to perish at Bełżec during the liquidation of yet another Jewish ghetto in German-occupied Poland. In June 1945, two survivors testified at the trial of camp personnel in Łódź. The three best-known survivors testified about Chełmno at the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. Two survivors testified also at the camp personnel trials conducted in 1962–65 by West Germany.

== Background ==
Chełmno nad Nerem is a village in Poland, annexed to Nazi Germany in 1939 and renamed &quot;Kulmhof&quot; during German occupation. As the Nazis themselves exclusively referred to the camp as &quot;Kulmhof&quot;, the name &quot;Chełmno extermination camp&quot; is not historically accurate, with its use perhaps deriving from the Main Commission for Investigation of German Crimes in Poland shortly after the war.

Chełmno (Kulmhof) camp was set up by &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Herbert Lange, following his gas van experiments in the murder of 1,558 Polish prisoners of the Soldau concentration camp northeast of Chełmno nad Nerem. In October 1941, Lange toured the area looking for a suitable site for an extermination centre, and chose Chełmno on the Ner, because of the estate, with a large manor house similar to Sonnenstein, which could be used for mass admissions of prisoners with only minor modifications. Staff for the facility was selected personally by Ernst Damzog, Commander of Security Police and SD from headquarters in occupied Poznań (Posen). Damzog formed the &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Lange&quot; (special detachment), and appointed Herbert Lange the first camp commandant because of his experience in the mass-murder of Poles from &quot;Wartheland&quot; (Wielkopolska). Lange served with &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; VI during Operation Tannenberg. Already by mid-1940, Lange and his men were responsible for the murder of about 1,100 patients in Owińska, 2,750 patients at Kościan, 1,558 patients and 300 Poles at Działdowo, and hundreds of Poles at Fort VII where the mobile gas-chamber (&quot;Einsatzwagen&quot;) was invented. Their earlier hospital victims were usually shot out of town in the back of the neck. The two so-called &quot;Kaisers-Kaffe&quot; vans, manufactured by the Gaubschat factory in Berlin, were delivered in November. Chełmno began mass gassing operations on using vehicles approved by &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Reinhard Heydrich from RSHA. Two months later, on , Heydrich, who had already confirmed the effectiveness of industrial-scale murder by exhaust fumes, called a secret meeting of German officials to undertake the European-wide Final Solution to the Jewish Question under the pretext of &quot;resettlement&quot;. 
The use of the killing centre at Chełmno for the mass murder of rapidly growing number of Jews deported to the Łódź Ghetto (&quot;Special Handling&quot;, the &quot;Sonderbehandlung&quot;) was initiated by Arthur Greiser, the Governor of &quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot;. In a letter to Himmler dated , Greiser referred to an authorization he had received from him and Reinhard Heydrich, stating that the clandestine program of murdering 100,000 Polish Jews, about one-third of the total Jewish population of &quot;Wartheland&quot;, was expected to be carried out soon. Greiser&#x27;s plan was based on the German government&#x27;s decision of October 1941 to deport German Jews to the Łódź Ghetto. Greiser and the SS decided to create space for the incoming Jews by annihilating the existing Polish-Jewish population in his district.

According to post-war testimony of Wilhelm Koppe, Higher SS and Police Leader for &quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot;, Koppe received an order from Himmler to liaise with Greiser regarding the &quot;Sonderbehandlung&quot; requested by the latter. Koppe entrusted the extermination operation to &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Ernst Damzog from Security Police in Poznań. Damzog supervised the camp&#x27;s daily operations thereafter.

== Architecture ==
The killing center consisted of a vacated manorial estate in the village of Chełmno on the Ner river, and a large forest clearing about northwest of Chełmno, off the road to Koło town with a sizable Jewish population which had been previously ghettoized. The two sites were known respectively as the &quot;Schlosslager&quot; (manor-house camp) and the &quot;Waldlager&quot; (forest camp). On the grounds of the estate was a large two-story brick country house called &quot;the palace&quot;. Its rooms were adapted to use as the reception offices, including space for the victims to undress and to give up their valuables. The &quot;SS&quot; and police staff and guards were housed in other buildings in the town. The Germans had a high wooden fence built around the manor house and the grounds. The clearing in the forest camp, which contained large mass graves, was likewise fenced off. The camp consisted of separate zones: an administration section with nearby barracks and storage for plundered goods; and the more distant burial and cremation site to which victims were delivered in hermetically proofed &quot;superstructures&quot;.

=== Operations ===
The &quot;SS-Sonderkommando &quot;Lange&quot;&quot; was supplied with two vans initially, each carrying about 50 Jews gassed en route to the forest. Later on, Lange was given three gas vans by the RSHA in Berlin for the murder of greater numbers of victims. The vehicles had been converted to mobile gas-chambers by the Gaubschat company (de) in Berlin which, by June 1942, produced twenty of them in accordance with the SS purchase order. The sealed compartments (also called superstructures) installed on the chassis had floor openings – about in diameter – with metal pipes welded below, into which the engine exhaust was directed. Victims generally suffocated to death, with their &quot;bodies thrown out blue, wet with sweat and urine, the legs covered with excrement and menstrual blood&quot;. Drivers of gas vans also heard victims screaming and knocking on the walls.

The SS had first used pure carbon monoxide from steel cylinders to murder mental patients in extermination hospitals of Action T4, and therefore had considerable knowledge of its efficacy. For all practical purposes, the extermination by mobile gas vans proved equally efficient following Operation Barbarossa of 1941. In the newly occupied territories, the gas vans were used to murder mental patients as well as Jews in the extermination ghettos. By employing just three vans on the Eastern Front (the &quot;Opel-Blitz&quot; and the larger &quot;Saurerwagen&quot;), without any faults occurring in the vehicles, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were able to murder 97,000 captives in less than six months between December 1941 and June 1942. The SS relayed urgent requests to Berlin for more vans.

The rank and file of the so-called &quot;SS Special Detachment Lange&quot; was made up of Gestapo, Criminal Police, and Order Police personnel, under the leadership of Security Police and SD officers. Herbert Lange was replaced as camp commandant in March (or April) 1942 by Schultze. He was succeeded by SS-Captain Hans Bothmann, who formed and led the &quot;Special Detachment Bothmann&quot;. The maximum strength of each Special Detachment was just under 100 men, of whom around 80 belonged to the Order Police. The local &quot;SS&quot; also maintained a &quot;paper command&quot; of the camps &quot;Allgemeine-SS&quot; inspectorate, to which most of the Chełmno camp staff were attached for administrative purposes. Historians do not believe members of the 120th SS-Standarte office established in Chełmno performed any duties at the camp.

== Deportations begin ==

The &quot;SS&quot; and police began murdering victims at Chełmno on . The first people transported to the camp were the Jewish and Romani populations of Koło, Dąbie, Sompolno, Kłodawa, Babiak, Izbica Kujawska, Bugaj, Nowiny Brdowskie and Kowale Pańskie. A total of 3,830 Jews and around 4,000 Romani were murdered by gas before February 1942. The victims were brought from all over Koło County () to Koło by rail with the last stop in Powiercie. Using whips, the Orpo police marched them toward the Warta river near Zawadka, where they were locked overnight in a mill, without food or water. The next morning, they were loaded onto lorries and taken to Chełmno. At &quot;the palace&quot;, they were stripped of possessions, transferred to vans, and murdered with exhaust fumes on the way to burial pits in the forest. The daily average for the camp was about six to nine van-loads of the dead. The drivers used gas-masks. From January 1942, the transports included hundreds of Poles and Soviet prisoners of war. In addition, they included over 10,000 Jews from Germany, Austria, Bohemia, Moravia and Luxembourg, who had first been deported to the ghetto in Łódź and subsisted there already for weeks.

In late February 1942, the secretary of the local Polish council in Chełmno, Stanisław Kaszyński (b. 1903), was arrested for trying to bring public attention to what was being perpetrated at the camp. He was interrogated and executed three days later on February 28, 1942, near a church along with his wife. His secret communiqué was intercepted by the &quot;SS-Sonderkommando&quot;. Today, there is an obelisk to his memory erected at Chełmno on . Over 4,500, Czech Jews from Prague were sent to the Łódź Ghetto before May 1942. One of the sisters of author Franz Kafka, Valli Kafka (born 1890), was murdered with them before mid-September.

=== Killing process ===
During the first five weeks, the murder victims came only from the nearby areas. On reaching their final destination before &quot;transport&quot; to Germany and Austria, the Jews disembarked in the courtyard of the &quot;Schlosslager&quot; manor where the &quot;SS&quot; men wearing white coats and pretending to be medics waited for them with a translator released earlier from the Gestapo prison in Poznań. The victims were led to a large empty room and ordered to undress; their clothing stacked for disinfection. They were told that all hidden banknotes would be destroyed during steaming and needed to be taken out and handed over for safe-keeping. Occasionally they were met by a German officer dressed as a local squire with a Tyrolean hat, announcing that some of them would remain there.

Wearing just underwear, with the women allowed to keep slips on, the victims were taken to the cellar and across the ramp into the back of a gas van holding from 50–70 people each (&quot;Opel Blitz&quot;) and up to 150 (&quot;Magirus&quot;). When the van was full, the doors were shut and the engine started. Surviving witnesses heard their screams as they were dying of asphyxiation. After about 5–10 minutes, the vans full of corpses were driven to the forest &quot;Waldlager&quot; camp. The vans were unloaded to excavated mass graves, and cleaned by the &quot;Waldkommando&quot; before returning to the manor house. &quot;Scharführer&quot; Walter Burmeister, a gas-van driver, made sure his own vehicle &quot;would be cleaned of the excretions of the people that had died in it. Afterwards, it would once again be used for gassing&quot; at the loading dock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klee-Dressen-Riess/Jewish Virtual Library&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Murder of Jews from the Łódź ghetto ===

On January 16, 1942, the &quot;SS&quot; and police began deportations from the Łódź Ghetto lasting for two weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishgen/timeline&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; German officials with the aid of &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; rounded up 10,000 Polish Jews based on selection by the ghetto &quot;Judenrat&quot;. The victims were transported from the Radegast train station in Łódź, to Koło railway station, northwest of Chełmno. There, the &quot;SS&quot; and police personnel supervised transfer of prisoners from the freight as well as passenger trains, to smaller-size cargo trains running on narrow gauge tracks, which took them from Koło to a much smaller Powiercie station, just outside Chełmno.

As round-ups in Łódź normally took place in the morning, it was usually late afternoon by the time Jews disembarked from the Holocaust trains in Powiercie. Therefore, they were marched to a disused mill at Zawadki some two kilometres distance where they spent the night. The mill building continued to be used after the railway repairs, if transports arrived late. The following morning the Jews were transported from Zawadki by truck, in numbers which could be easily controlled at their destination. The victims were &quot;processed&quot; immediately upon arrival at the manor-house. Beginning in late July 1942, the victims were brought to the camp directly from Powiercie after the regular railway line linking Koło with Dąbie was restored; and the bridge over the Rgilewka River had been repaired.

== &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; ==
The German SS staff selected young Jewish prisoners from incoming transports to join the camp &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;, a special unit of 50 to 60 men deployed at the forest burial camp. They removed corpses from the gas-vans and placed them in mass graves. The large trenches were quickly filled, but the smell of decomposing bodies began to permeate the surrounding countryside including nearby villages. In the spring of 1942, the &quot;SS&quot; ordered burning of the bodies in the forest. The bodies were cremated on open air grids constructed of concrete slabs and rail tracks; pipes were used for air ducts, and long ash pans were built below the grid. Later, the Jewish Sonderkommando had to exhume the mass graves and burn the previously interred bodies. In addition, they sorted the clothing of the victims, and cleaned the excrement and blood from the vans.

A small detachment of about 15 Jews worked at the manor house, sorting and packing the belongings of the victims. Between eight and ten skilled craftsmen worked there to produce or repair goods for the &quot;SS&quot; Special Detachment. 

Periodically, the &quot;SS&quot; executed the members of the Jewish special detachment and replaced them with workers selected from recent transports. The &quot;SS&quot; held jumping contests and races among the prisoners, who were shackled with chains on their ankles, to deem who was fit to continue working. The losers of such contests were shot.

== Stages of camp operation ==
The early killing process carried out by the SS from December 8, 1941, until mid-January 1942, was intended to murder Jews from all nearby towns and villages, which were slated for German colonization (&quot;Lebensraum&quot;). From mid-January 1942, the SS and Order Police began transporting Jews in crowded freight and passenger trains from Łódź. By then, Jews had also been deported to Łódź from Germany, Bohemia-Moravia, and Luxembourg, and were included in the transports at that time. The transports included most of the 5,000 Roma (Gypsies) who had been deported from Austria. Throughout 1942, the Jews from &quot;Wartheland&quot; were still being processed; in March 1943 the SS declared the district &quot;judenfrei&quot;. Other victims murdered at the killing center included several hundred Poles, and Soviet prisoners of war.

During the summer of 1942, the new commandant Bothmann made substantial changes to the camp&#x27;s murder techniques. The change was prompted by two incidents in March and April of that year. First, the gas-van broke down on the highway while full of living victims. Many passers-by heard their loud cries. Soon after that, the Saurer van exploded while the driver was revving its engine at the loading ramp; the gassing compartment was full of living Jews. The explosion blew off the locked back door, and badly burned the victims inside. Drivers were replaced. Bothmann&#x27;s modifications included adding poison to gasoline. There is evidence that some red powder and a fluid were delivered from Germany by Maks Sado freight company, in order to murder the victims more quickly. Another major change involved parking the gas vans while prisoners were murdered. They were no longer driven en route to the forest cremation area with living victims inside.

After having annihilated almost all Jews of &quot;Wartheland&quot; District, in March 1943 the Germans closed the Chełmno killing centre, while Operation Reinhard was still underway elsewhere. Other death camps had faster methods of murdering and incinerating people. Chełmno was not a part of Reinhard. The &quot;SS&quot; ordered complete demolition of &quot;Schlosslager,&quot; along with the manor house, which was levelled. To hide the evidence of the &quot;SS&quot;-committed war crimes, from 1943 onward, the Germans ordered the exhumation of all remains and burning of bodies in open-air cremation pits by a unit of &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; 1005. The bones were crushed on cement with mallets and added to the ashes. These were transported every night in sacks made of blankets to river Warta (or to the Ner River) on the other side of Zawadka, where they were dumped into the water from a bridge and from a flat-bottomed boat. Eventually, the camp authorities bought a bone-crushing machine (&quot;Knochenmühle&quot;) from Schriever and Co. in Hamburg to speed up the process.

=== The final extermination phase ===

On , in spite of earlier demolition of &quot;the palace&quot;, the &quot;SS&quot; renewed gassing operations at Chełmno in order to complete the annihilation of the remaining 70,000 Jewish prisoners of the ghetto in Łódź,&lt;ref name=&quot;ghetto/history&quot;&gt;Jewish Virtual Library, Łódź. Overview of the Litzmannstadt Ghetto History. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Online Exhibition: &quot;Give Me Your Children.&quot; Voices from the Lodz Ghetto. Retrieved June 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the last ghetto in occupied Poland to produce war supplies for the Germans. The Special Detachment &quot;Bothmann&quot; returned to the forest and resumed murdering victims at a smaller camp, consisting of brand new wooden barracks along with new crematory pyres.

First, the victims were taken to the desecrated church in Chełmno where they spent the night if necessary, and left their bundles behind on the way to the reception area. They were driven to the forest, where the camp authorities had constructed two fenced-out barracks for undressing before &quot;shower&quot;, and two new open-air cremation pits, further up. The &quot;SS&quot; and police guarded the victims as they took off their clothes and gave up valuables before entering gas-vans. In this final phase of the camp operation, some 25,000 Jews were murdered. Their bodies were burned immediately after death. From mid-July 1944, the &quot;SS&quot; and police began deporting the remaining inhabitants of the Łódź ghetto to Auschwitz-Birkenau.

In September 1944, the &quot;SS&quot; brought in a new Commando 1005 of Jewish prisoners from outside the &quot;Wartheland&quot; District to exhume and cremate remaining corpses and to remove evidence of the mass murder operations. A month later, the &quot;SS&quot; executed about half of the 80-man detachment after most of the work was done. The gas vans were sent back to Berlin. The remaining Jewish workers were executed just before the German retreat from the Chełmno killing center on January 18, 1945, as the Soviet army approached (it reached the camp two days later). The 15-year-old Jewish prisoner Simon Srebnik was the only one to survive the last executions with a gunshot wound to the head. Historians estimate that the &quot;SS&quot; murdered at least 152,000–180,000 people at Chełmno between December 1941 and March 1943, and from , until the Soviet advance. Note: a 1946–47 report by the placed the number closer to 340,000 based on a statistical approach, as the camp authorities had destroyed all waybills in an effort to hide their actions.

== Chełmno trials ==

After the war, some Chełmno extermination camp personnel were tried in Poland as well as in other court cases spanning a period of about 20 years. The first judicial trial of three former members of the &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Kulmhof&quot;, including camp&#x27;s deputy commandant &quot;Oberscharführer&quot; Walter Piller, took place in 1945 at the District Court in Łódź. The examination of evidence during the investigation was carried out by Judge Władysław Bednarz. The subsequent four trials, held in Bonn, began in 1962 and concluded three years later in 1965 in Cologne.

Adolf Eichmann testified about the camp during his 1961 war-crimes trial in Jerusalem. He visited it once in late 1942. Simon Srebnik, from the burial &quot;Sonderkommando,&quot; testified in both the Chelmno Guard and Eichmann trials. Nicknamed &quot;Spinnefix&quot; at the camp, Srebnik was recognised by the Chelmno Guards only by this moniker. Walter Burmeister, a gas-van driver (not to be confused with the camp&#x27;s &quot;SS-Unterscharfuehrer&quot; Walter Burmeister), testified in Bonn in 1967.

== Survivors ==

According to the &quot;Holocaust Encyclopedia&quot;, a total of seven Jews from the burial &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; escaped from the &quot;Waldlager&quot;. Determining the identities of the few survivors of Chełmno had presented ambiguity because records use different versions of their names. One survivor may not have been recorded in the early postwar years because he did not testify at trials of camp personnel. Five escaped during the winter of 1942, including Mordechaï Podchlebnik, Milnak Meyer, Abraham Tauber, Abram Roj and Szlama Ber Winer (Szlamek Bajler) whose identity was recognized also as Yakov or Jacob Grojanowski. Mordechaï Zurawski and Simon Srebnik escaped later. Srebnik was among Jews shot by the Germans two days before the Russians entered Chełmno, but he survived. Winer wrote under pseudonym Grojanowski about the operations of the camp in his &quot;Grojanowski Report&quot;, but he was rounded up with thousands of others and murdered in the gas chamber of Bełżec extermination camp.
In June 1945, both Podchlebnik and Srebnik (then age fifteen), testified at the Chełmno trials of camp personnel in Łódź, Poland. In addition to being included in the &quot;Holocaust Encyclopedia&quot;, Mordechaï Zurawski is included as survivor in three other sources, each of which documents his testifying, along with Srebnik and Podchlebnik about his experience at Chełmno, at the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. In addition, Srebnik testified in the Chelmno Guard Trials of 1962–63. The French director Claude Lanzmann included interviews with Srebnik and Podchlebnik in his documentary &quot;Shoah&quot;, referring to them as the only two Jewish survivors of Chełmno, but this was mistaken. Some sources repeat that only Simon Srebnik and Mordechaï Podchlebnik survived the war but these are also in error. Podchlebnik is sometimes referred to as Michał (or Michael), in Polish and English versions of his name.

Not all escapees have been identified in the postwar period. In 2002 Dr. Sara Roy of Harvard University wrote that her father, Abraham Roy, belonged to the aforementioned survivors. She said that her father was the escapee recognized by the &quot;Holocaust Encyclopedia&quot; as Abram Roj, although she was mistaken about their total number. Two other survivors of Chełmno include Yitzhak Justman and Yerachmiel Yisrael Widawski who escaped together from the forest burial commando in the winter of 1942. They arrived at Piotrków Trybunalski Ghetto in March 1942 and deposited their testimonies with Rabbi Moshe Chaim Lau. Widawski spoke with Rabbi Lau as well as some members of the prewar Communal Council before he left the ghetto, robbing them of their peace of mind with earth-shattering facts about the extermination process. Widawski saw the bodies of thirteen relatives murdered in gas vans including his own fiancée. Both fugitives, Justman and Widawski, arrived also at the Częstochowa Ghetto and met with Rabbi Chanoch Gad Justman. They headed in various directions, making a great effort to inform and warn the Jewish communities about the fate that awaited them. However, many people refused to believe their stories.

<doc id="581020" wikidata="Q1198484" url="?curid=581020" title="Pikmin (video game)">
<text>is a 2001 real-time strategy puzzle video game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. The game was created and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, and is the first entry in the &quot;Pikmin&quot; series. The game&#x27;s story focuses on an alien pilot, Captain Olimar, who crash lands on a mysterious planet and must make use of a native species called &quot;Pikmin&quot; to find his ship&#x27;s missing parts in order to escape within 30 days. Players take control of Olimar and direct the different varieties of Pikmin to explore the game&#x27;s various levels, overcoming obstacles and hostile creatures, in order to find and recover the missing ship parts.

&quot;Pikmin&quot; was well-received by critics and was commercially successful, selling over one million copies worldwide. It spawned a series of sequels, starting with &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;, which was released in 2004. The game was ported to Wii in 2008 in Japan and 2009 for the rest of the world as part of the &quot;New Play Control!&quot; series, while a high-definition remaster was released for Nintendo Switch in 2023.

== Gameplay ==
The main goal in the game is to retrieve ship parts by using the three varieties of Pikmin available in different combinations. Captain Olimar discovers multi-colored plant-animal hybrids that willingly follow his orders and help him recover the parts. All three of the Pikmin colors that Olimar discovers must be used in order to overcome various obstacles and complete the game. The Pikmin creatures come in three colors: red, yellow and blue. Red Pikmin are the first type found in the game, resistant to fire and the strongest type of Pikmin with respect to combat. Yellow Pikmin can be thrown higher than the other two and can carry explosives called &quot;bomb rocks&quot; . They are utilized in various tasks, including carrying objects and enemies, breaking down walls, and defeating enemies. Blue Pikmin are the only ones that are able to survive in water and throw Pikmin of other colors across it. Objects that can be carried vary between ship parts, enemy carcasses and pellets, which are brought back to a base camp established in the current zone, containing Olimar&#x27;s ship and apparati representative of each kind of Pikmin called Onions, the latter which can convert carcasses and pellets to Pikmin seeds. Only one hundred Pikmin, whether planted or plucked, can be on the ground at a time.

The time limit is divided into thirty days. With the exception of the first day, which lasts until the player finds the first ship part, all days in the game are about thirteen minutes in length, which can prematurely end at the player&#x27;s request or if Olimar&#x27;s health, replenished at his spacecraft, is depleted from attacks by native creatures. The day also ends prematurely if all Pikmin in the zone go extinct, and the next day will begin with one new seed of every discovered kind of Pikmin. By the end of each day, Olimar needs to stop all work and bring as many Pikmin as possible back to the base camp so that they can flee the planet&#x27;s nocturnal predators in the safety of their Onions, as they also provide Pikmin shelter and transportation between zones; any Pikmin who do not make it back to base are eaten by said predators on each night prior to Olimar&#x27;s last day on the planet. At such time, Olimar will write a daily update to his ship log, which may be affected by events on that particular day, reflect on his efforts to escape, or provide useful gameplay hints. As more parts are recovered, the ship regains functionality and can bring Olimar to up to four new zones on the planet to find the remaining parts. The game has three different endings, depending on Olimar&#x27;s progress in collecting ship parts. Collecting all thirty grants the best ending, while collecting at least the twenty-five mandatory parts within the 30-day time limit grants the normal ending. Failing to do so results in Olimar&#x27;s ship&#x27;s life support system failing and Olimar dying from oxygen poisoning.

Apart from the main gameplay, &quot;Pikmin&quot; also contains a Challenge Mode that is unlocked once Olimar gets all three types of Pikmin. Each of the five zones in the main game are available for play. The object of Challenge Mode is to grow the greatest number of Pikmin in one day as is possible.

== Plot ==
In &quot;Pikmin&quot;, the main protagonist is Captain Olimar, a tiny, one-inch tall humanoid extraterrestrial from the planet Hocotate. The story starts when Olimar is taking an intergalactic vacation in outer space. However, during his flight, a comet hits his spacecraft, the S.S. &quot;Dolphin&quot; (a reference to the GameCube&#x27;s codename, &quot;Project Dolphin&quot;), which is then pulled into the gravity field of an uncharted planet. Parts of the spaceship fall off as it plummets to the ground and crashes.

When he regains consciousness, Olimar finds out that the planet&#x27;s atmosphere contains high levels of poisonous oxygen and he can stay on the planet for only thirty days before his life support system stops functioning. Olimar must retrieve all 30 of his lost spaceship parts so he can rebuild his spaceship and return to Hocotate. Although Olimar initially states in his journal entries that he needs all thirty parts, as the game progresses, it is hinted that some parts might not be needed to actually lift off and, indeed, one can successfully complete the game with only 25 parts rather than all 30.

To help Olimar are indigenous creatures called Pikmin, which are nearly extinct and unable to survive in the environment without direct leadership. Olimar helps the Pikmin reproduce by leading them into battle with the dangerous wildlife of the planet and carrying them back to their flying nests called Onions to produce seeds to grow more Pikmin. As this element of symbiosis develops, Olimar discovers parts of the &quot;Dolphin&quot; and travels across the Pikmin Planet, which is assumed to be Earth, albeit with fictional fauna and far after the extinction of humans. The game has three endings depending upon how many ship parts the player successfully reacquires. Two good endings occur should the player retrieve all thirty parts or twenty-five necessary parts, and a bad ending occurs should the player fail to find twenty-five parts.

In the best ending, Olimar successfully retrieves the final ship part from an Emperor Bulblax. That night, Olimar bids the Pikmin farewell before blasting off the planet. The Pikmin then fight off a large predator, having learned to survive on their own thanks to Olimar&#x27;s guidance. As Olimar escapes the planet&#x27;s atmosphere and flies home to Hocotate, many more Onions of differing colors rise above the planet&#x27;s surface, suggesting many types of Pikmin yet undiscovered. &quot;Pikmin&quot; &quot;2&quot; establishes this as the canon ending.

If thirty days pass with all 25 required ship parts collected but not the 5 optional parts, Olimar is forced to hastily escape the planet before his life support system ceases function, leaving the Pikmin to fend for themselves, but Olimar nonetheless successfully escapes the planet. If Olimar is unable to collect all 25 required ship parts before thirty days pass, Olimar attempts to blast off the planet, only for the Dolphin to fail and crash back onto the surface. The Pikmin carry his body to the Onion and turn him into a cross between a Hocotatian and a Pikmin.

== Development ==
&quot;Pikmin&quot; was developed by Nintendo EAD and directed by Shigefumi Hino and Masamichi Abe (who had directed &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot;) and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Hiroyuki Kimura as one of the first GameCube games.

The artstyle of the game was inspired by the works of Tim Burton, and the theming was inspired by &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot;, and &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; by Richard Dawkins. 

Colin Reed, who had programmed 1080° Snowboarding, programmed Pikmin. The foundation of &quot;Pikmin&quot; technology is in the animation and agency of a multitude of interacting characters. A technical demonstration called &quot;Super Mario 128&quot; was shown at Nintendo Space World 2000, showing the performance of the prototype GameCube hardware by animating up to 128 copies of Mario at once. Miyamoto stated in 2007 that &quot;most of you have already played [&quot;Super Mario 128&quot;] - but you played it in a game called &quot;Pikmin&quot;.&quot;

The name &quot;Pikmin&quot; derives from the Japanese word used during development to count the small creatures, , which became &quot;Piki&quot;, then &quot;Picky&quot; and finally &quot;Pikmin&quot;.

The development team of &quot;Pikmin&quot; expressed their initial trouble finding the game&#x27;s direction. Hino explains:
 The score was composed by Hajime Wakai, who was one of two composers for &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;.

&quot;Pikmin&quot; was developed on Microsoft Windows. A Windows version of the game with debugging features is hidden on the GameCube version&#x27;s disc.

== Reception ==

Upon being revealed at E3 2001, &quot;Pikmin&quot; garnered positive reception. &quot;IGN&quot; praised it for its uniqueness and its stunning graphics, with only a few negative points such as a poor camera. It was awarded the title of &quot;Best Puzzle/Trivia/Parlor Game&quot; from the Game Critics Awards, beating out &quot;ChuChu Rocket!&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. It was also runner-up for &quot;Most Original Game&quot;, losing out to &quot;Majestic&quot;. It was a nominee for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best GameCube Game&quot; and, among console games, &quot;Most Innovative&quot; awards. These went respectively to &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;.

Since its release for the GameCube, &quot;Pikmin&quot; has received positive reception. It holds an average score of 89/100 from Metacritic. It was given the award for interactivity from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. &quot;Pikmin&quot; has received significant praise for its graphics, in particular the design of the surrounding environment. Gaming Age editor Craig Majaski described &quot;Pikmin&quot; as both stunning and having a detailed environment. Brian McTaggart of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; praised it for its graphics, gameplay, and originality, but criticized it for being short. As of March 31, 2002, &quot;Pikmin&quot; has sold over one million copies.

Chris Slate reviewed the GameCube version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;A charming, addictive game that backs up Nintendo&#x27;s promise to innovate on GameCube. If you like puzzles, then get your thinking cap on and put those Pikmin to work.&quot;

During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences honored &quot;Pikmin&quot; with the &quot;Innovation in Console Gaming&quot; award, along with receiving nominations for &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot;. 

===Re-releases===
The Wii re-release of &quot;Pikmin&quot; was not as well-received as the GameCube version, though it still had mostly positive reception; it holds an average score of 77/100 from Metacritic.

In his review of the Nintendo Switch version, PJ O&#x27;Reilly of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; described the remaster as &quot;bare-bones&quot;. He compared it to &quot;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&quot;, where many of the graphical updates consist of upscaling as opposed to a more detailed reworking of the game&#x27;s textures. He nonetheless praised the core game, calling it a &quot;must-play&quot; and giving the remaster a score of 8/10.

===Sales===
In its first week, &quot;Pikmin&quot; sold more than 101,000 copies. However, sales fell to only between 10,000 and 15,000 copies in the weeks following. Following the release of &quot;Ai no Uta&quot; by Strawberry Flower, an image song related to &quot;Pikmin&quot;, its sales recovered slightly to about 22,000 copies in a week. The song appeared in the Japanese commercials for the game, but soon became an unexpected hit song, eventually eclipsing &quot;Pikmin&quot;″s sales. In the weeks of December 24, 2001, and January 6, 2002, &quot;Pikmin&quot; sold approximately 53,000 copies and 102,000 copies respectively. To date, &quot;Pikmin&quot; has sold at least 1.19 million copies worldwide; 680,000 in the United States and 507,011 in Japan. By January 3, 2010, the Wii version of &quot;Pikmin&quot; had sold 169,036 copies in Japan. Since its release, &quot;Pikmin&quot; has developed a vocal and devoted fanbase. 

== Re-releases ==
&quot;Pikmin&quot; and its sequel &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; are part of the &quot;New Play Control&quot; series, a selection of GameCube video game remakes with additional support for features of the Wii. It was released on December 25, 2008, in Japan, February 6, 2009, in Europe and March 9, 2009, in North America (original version only). &quot;New Play Control! Pikmin&quot; uses the Wii Remote, and requires the player to point and click on the screen to do various tasks instead of manually moving a cursor with a control stick. It was also announced that the game saves day-by-day records of the player&#x27;s playthrough, allowing the player to restart from any recorded day of their choice. In an interview, director Shigefumi Hino stated that besides adding motion controls, they wanted to include the ability to go back to saves they have made in the past, allowing players to replay all 30 days one by one in order to improve. HD remasters of &quot;Pikmin&quot; and &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; for Nintendo Switch were announced and released digitally on June 21, 2023, and was released physically on September 22, 2023.

<text>Kirat Karō (Gurmukhi: ਕਿਰਤ ਕਰੋ) is one of the three pillars of Sikhism, the others being Naam Japo and Vaṇḍ chakkō. The term means to earn an honest, pure and dedicated living by exercising one&#x27;s God-given skills, abilities, talents and hard labour for the benefit and improvement of the individual, their family and society at large. This means to work with determination and focus by the sweat of one&#x27;s brow and not to be lazy and to waste one&#x27;s life to time. Meanwhile, &quot;Simran&quot; and dedication to the work of God, not personal gain, should be one&#x27;s main motivation.

No new members were added to the House after 1919, due to the creation of the Irish Free State, however, the already sitting members continued to remain part of the House, with the last member dying in 1961.

Once elected, peers held their seats for life. Some of these peers were granted a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom which gave them a hereditary seat in the House of Lords. These peers also remained as representative peers and were not replaced until their deaths.

<text>Caleb Carr (August 2, 1955 – May 23, 2024) was an American military historian and author. Carr was the second of three sons born to Lucien Carr and Francesca Von Hartz.

Carr authored &quot;The Alienist&quot;, &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;, &quot;Casing the Promised Land&quot;, &quot;The Lessons of Terror&quot;, &quot;Killing Time&quot;, &quot;The Devil Soldier&quot;, &quot;The Italian Secretary&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Broken&quot;, as well as &#x27;My Beloved Monster&#x27;, a memoir about his relationship with Masha, his half-wild Siberian Forest Cat. He previously taught military history at Bard College, and worked extensively in film, television, and the theater. His military and political writings appeared in numerous magazines and periodicals, among them &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He lived in upstate New York.

== Early years and education==
Carr was born on August 2, 1955, in Manhattan, one of three sons born to Beat Generation figure Lucien Carr and Francesca von Hartz. Lucien&#x27;s close circle of friends included William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, and Allen Ginsberg, whom Lucien had known since his college days. Their frequent presence in the Carr household affected Carr&#x27;s future career: &quot;They were noisy drunks that were a disruption. They made me determined never to be a fiction writer&quot;. This reaffirmed an earlier sentiment in a 1997 interview, where he stated that, as a child, he &quot;wanted nothing less than to be a fiction writer&quot;.

Carr received his primary education from St. Luke&#x27;s School in Greenwich Village and his secondary education from Friends Seminary, also in downtown New York City. Carr&#x27;s interest in military history did not help him fit in at Friends Seminary, a Quaker school. He was an excellent student, but he was guilty of pranks like setting off cherry bombs in the school lavatories. When he discovered that his school transcript was marked &quot;Socially Undesirable&quot;, he was &quot;stunned&quot;. &quot;We had guys in our school who dealt opium and cocaine out of their lockers, and the teacher would take them aside and have conversations&quot;. The designation was enough to keep him out of Harvard. He attended Kenyon College, in Gambier, Ohio, from 1973 to 1975 and returned to New York City in 1975 to complete his education at New York University, where, in 1977, he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in military and diplomatic history.

Much of Carr&#x27;s fiction deals with violence perpetrated by people whose behavior has its origins in childhood abuse. His father, whose famously turbulent childhood ended in a conviction for manslaughter, inflicted physical and emotional abuse upon his wife and children. Caleb remembered being singled out for his father&#x27;s beatings: &quot;He was enormously threatened by me, from the time I was a child—threatened by my tendency to speak what I perceived. Alcoholics don&#x27;t tend to like children like that.&quot; The physical and verbal abuse fueled by alcohol and rage didn&#x27;t stop even after Caleb&#x27;s parents divorced when he was eight. Carr did not learn about his father&#x27;s crime until he was 18. He recalls being shocked, &quot;but not exactly surprised&quot;.

The frequent presence of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs in the Carr home was a &quot;little unnerving&quot;. &quot;They could be perfectly nice people one-to-one&quot;, Carr told &quot;Salon&quot; in a 1997 interview. &quot;Kerouac was a very nice man. Allen could be a very nice guy. Burroughs was a little strange for a child. But they weren&#x27;t children people. You needed to be grown up to be around them if you wanted to not be terrified. What they were up to was not gonna make any child reassured.&quot;

After the Carrs&#x27; divorce, Kerouac proposed marriage to Caleb&#x27;s mother, but she turned him down and afterwards married writer John Speicher. Carr&#x27;s new stepfather was another heavy drinker, and Carr made weekly visits to Lucien. &quot;There was a lot of craziness in the family,&quot; Carr remembered, &quot;and a lot of alcoholism among the adults.&quot; Speicher had three daughters from a previous marriage, and they and the three Carr brothers bonded, a group that Caleb would label &quot;the dark Brady Bunch&quot;. They spent most summers at a house in upstate New York, originally bought by Carr&#x27;s maternal grandparents, then owned by his mother. &quot;When the adults weren&#x27;t around it was a place of great solace. When they were, it was a place of great exploration because being in the house too much wasn&#x27;t an option.&quot;

Likewise, when the family was back in New York City, Caleb spent as much time as possible away from their apartment. Among his favorite havens, other than the streets of Manhattan themselves, were the city&#x27;s movie theaters. He at first preferred classic and then war movies, and became increasingly interested in military history. &quot;Part of it was a desire to find violence that was, in the first place, directed toward some sort of purposeful end, and second, governed by a definable ethical code. And I think it&#x27;s fairly obvious why I would want to do that&quot;, he told &quot;New York&quot; magazine in 1994.

==Career==

===Early career===
Carr first went to work for the Council on Foreign Relations after high school as a library assistant, and rose during his college year summers (and a semester off) to research assistant. He also wrote freelance articles on global issues. During this period, he published his first nationally noticed broadside: a long indictment, published on the letters page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, of Henry Kissinger&#x27;s foreign policy. This assisted noted historian and expert on U.S. foreign policy James Chace in helping Carr, after he left New York University, to get a job as a researcher and editorial assistant for the &quot;Foreign Affairs Quarterly&quot;, where Chace was managing editor.

In 1980, Carr left &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; to fine-tune and publish his first novel, &quot;Casing the Promised Land&quot;, a coming of age story about three young men in New York City. It was dedicated to &quot;Everyone who fed me and to: James Chace&quot;. Nearly 20 years after &quot;Casing the Promised Land&quot; was published, the extreme prices that book dealers were offering for the volume forced Carr to post this &quot;self-criticism&quot; on the book&#x27;s Amazon.com page: &quot;I am the author of this book. It has a few good scenes, but is essentially &#x27;roman à clef&#x27; nonsense that every writer has to get out of his system early on. Do yourself a favor and read &quot;anything&quot; else I&#x27;ve written (you&#x27;ll be doing me a favor, too). Forgive the follies of youth&quot; (emphasis in the original).

James Chace brought Carr on to organize and edit his acclaimed book, &quot;Endless War&quot;, dealing with the crisis in Central America, which Carr then covered as a freelance journalist for the &quot;Berkshire Eagle&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 1988 Carr and Chace co-authored &quot;America Invulnerable: The Quest for Absolute Security from 1812 to Star Wars&quot;, an unprecedented and highly acclaimed study of United States of America&#x27;s traditional and unequivocal approach to national security, beginning with the nation&#x27;s founders. From the book: &quot;For more than two centuries, the United States has aspired to a condition of perfect safety from foreign threats. Alarmed by even potential dangers to the nation&#x27;s security, Americans have forcefully responded to both real and imagined assaults against our own borders as well as against those of foreign nations and provinces whose security we have seen as either strategically or politically linked to our own ... Yet the goal of absolute security has constantly eluded us.&quot;

In 1989 he became a contributing editor to &quot;MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History&quot;, a position he still held in 1994.

In 1991 Carr published &quot;The Devil Soldier: The Story of Frederick Townsend Ward, the American Soldier of Fortune Who Became a God in China&quot;, a biography, and the first of his books to receive wide recognition. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;by marshaling his scholarship well and setting it out as an adventure story, Mr. Carr gives a good picture of the buccaneering milieu of the time, and makes a plausible case for the devil soldier being on the side of the angels.&quot;

Carr was also active in Hollywood in the 1980s and &#x27;90s as a screenwriter and producer. He wrote one movie for television, &quot;Bad Attitudes&quot; (1991), but the revision and execution of his script deeply disappointed him.

===1990s===

Carr returned to New York to begin researching and writing what would prove his breakthrough novel, &quot;The Alienist&quot;, published in 1994. The book became an international bestseller and has been translated into more than 24 languages. Winner of the 1995 Anthony Award for best first novel (although technically it was his second), the book, set in 1896 New York City follows the exploits of a small band of individuals determined to catch a serial killer. The book was also nominated for the 1995 Bram Stoker award.

Carr&#x27;s lifelong interest in violence, which initially fed his study of military history, expanded into a study of serial killers with the advent of the Son of Sam murders of 1976–1977. (Once again, this was not a mere fascination with brutality, but with the underlying causes of violence and with people—especially military leaders—who seek to limit killing.) Later, as &quot;The Alienist&quot; began taking shape in his imagination, Carr immersed himself in the history of the New York City neighborhoods in which he had grown up and biographies of its notable figures of the Nineteenth century. He also sought the counsel, during a series of meetings, with Dr. David Abrahamsen, the psychiatrist who examined David Berkowitz after his capture and &quot;unraveled the mind&quot; of the Son of Sam killer. Carr sold the movie rights for &quot;The Alienist&quot; to Paramount based on an early draft of the book.

Returning to Hollywood, Carr wrote the pilot for a dystopian vision of the far future, &quot;The Osiris Chronicles&quot;, for Paramount Television. After a vigorous auction, sale of the broadcast rights went to CBS. Once again, however, the execution of the production was deeply disappointing to Carr, and the show was not picked up. Consulted by Paramount TV as to what could be done to salvage the pilot, Carr told Paramount that, if left to work on his own with the assistant editor, he could produce a new cut of the show for a television movie that would at least be moderately successful, especially abroad. Paramount agreed, and the movie, titled &quot;The Warlord: Battle for the Galaxy&quot; (1998), did indeed prove a modest success, particularly in foreign markets.

At the same time, he appeared on the History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Jack the Ripper: Phantom of Death&quot; (1995) as an expert commentator; additionally he was a guest commentator on PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Experience: New York Underground&quot;. He was also a featured commentator in Ric Burns&#x27; 1999 documentary New York: A Documentary History. Back in Los Angeles, he performed a page-one rewrite of William Wisher Jr.&#x27;s script for a prequel to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; for Morgan Creek Productions, resulting in a screenplay that attracted the legendary John Frankenheimer to direct, Liam Neeson to star, and the famed cinematographer Vittorio Storaro to shoot. But when Frankenheimer suddenly died and was replaced by Paul Schrader, who insisted on his own version of the script, Neeson abandoned the project and Carr, deeply disillusioned, returned to New York for the last time. He was given partial story credit for the two films eventually produced from the script, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, although, in a subsequent interview with the &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, Carr emphasized that the movies bore little to no relation to his story.

For his next novel, Carr brought back the principals from &quot;The Alienist&quot; to solve another serial murder case in &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;, published in 1997. The sequel not only sold more copies than its predecessor, it received more critical acclaim. This time, the killer at the center of the hunt is a female murdering infants. The narrator for this adventure is Stevie Taggart, the street urchin Dr. Laszlo Kreizler saved from jail years earlier. When asked about the subject matter, Carr stated, &quot;You want to believe that there&#x27;s one relationship in life that&#x27;s beyond betrayal—a relationship that&#x27;s beyond that kind of hurt—and there isn&#x27;t. The simple fact is, if the mothers that we see in the press are doing this kind of stuff, then the numbers who are actually doing it are probably much higher.&quot;

In 1996 he wrote a piece in the &quot;World Policy Journal&quot; titled &quot;Terrorism as Warfare: the Lessons of Military History&quot;. He also published widely recognized essays on the Somalia intervention (&quot;The Consequences of Somalia&quot;) on the corruption and what he saw as the immorality of the CIA (&quot;Aldrich Ames and the Conduct of American Intelligence&quot;), and the pointlessness of trying to pursue purely &quot;humanitarian&quot; military interventions, which the Clinton administration was trying to establish as a doctrine (&quot;The Humanitarian Illusion&quot;), along with numerous other security and military policy pieces. In recognition of these efforts, Random House appointed Carr editor for the Modern Library War series. Carr was also a member of their Modern Library Board. As such, in 1998 and 1999, he participated in the &quot;100 best&quot; project, voting on the 100 best novels and 100 best non-fiction works of the 20th century.

===Later career===

In 2000, Carr published his next novel, &quot;Killing Time&quot;, another dystopian tale of the future, this time the near future: 2023. First serialized in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1999. The book finds a world with an abundance of information too easily manipulated, thus frequently obscuring reality. The characters travel from New York to the jungles of Africa in their quest to use such manipulation for the benefit of mankind, only to find themselves enmeshed in the central tragic paradox of their efforts, summed up best in a line from the book that is now a commonplace: &quot;Information is not knowledge&quot;. Although some agreed with &quot;USA Today&quot; that &quot;Killing Time&quot; was &quot;a techno-terrifying tale of the information age run amok&quot; and &quot;a daring departure from the successful Alienist formula, but Carr is still a master of the cliffhanger, serving up a non-stop thrill ride as the story builds to a surprising finish&quot;, many found its stark view of information manipulation and its consequences too pessimistic, and the book was only briefly a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, which were along the lines that Carr had warned of in his writings on terrorism, he returned to the subject, using his &quot;Terrorism as Warfare&quot; piece as the basis for his best-selling, highly acclaimed but controversial book, &quot;The Lessons of Terror: A History of Warfare Against Civilians&quot;. Published in 2002, this study of the history of terrorism from ancient Rome to the present was among the first to provide a precise definition of terrorism, one that has endured and made the book a landmark book in the field: Once again, reviews were extreme but mixed: some did not share the opinion of the Christian Science Monitor, which foretold correctly that, &quot;After the deadly attacks against the United States, many Americans may now find Carr&#x27;s earlier arguments prescient and his approach the only one that has a chance of working;&quot; instead, many critics agreed with &quot;Newsweek&quot; opinion that, &quot;&quot;The Lessons of Terror&quot; is so earnest, so well informed and so outrageous ... that almost any reader will find something to love and something that will make you want to throw the book across the room. It is, in short, pure Carr.&quot; But the work achieved the influence among military historians, one of the most eminent of whom, John Lynn, subsequently declared, in his own ensuing volume, &quot;Battle: a History of Combat and Culture&quot;, that Carr&#x27;s &quot;insistence that Terrorism [sic] can be traced back to the ancient world and that great armies and great states have engaged in attacks on civilians designed to intimidate and terrorize them is important in both obvious and subtle ways&quot;, as well as among terrorism experts, and the military and defense communities that Carr had sought; and it formed the basis of his deeper involvement in an advisory capacity for members of the government. Shortly after its publication, he testified before the House Subcommittee on National Security, met privately with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to discuss the future of the war on terrorism, and served as a guest speaker on every major network and many cable news outlets during the American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Carr was scheduled to appear on February 6, 2002, at the Council on Foreign Relations to discuss his book, &quot;The Lessons of Terror&quot;. On February 4, 2002, the appearance was cancelled. Various reasons for the halting of the engagement were put forth in the media. One council member was told there was a scheduling conflict; others alleged not enough members signed up; yet Carr believed the real reason was due to his criticisms of Henry Kissinger, who was a member of the council.

Bard College had asked Carr, in 2003, to speak on the topic of Imperial America. He furthered his relationship with Bard as a visiting professor of history from 2004 to 2005 teaching courses ranging from World Military History to the History of American Intelligence to the History of Insurgencies and Counter Insurgencies. He also taught a course in Criminal Profiling at John Jay College in Manhattan. In 2007, he again participated in the Bard Globalization and International Affairs Program&#x27;s Speakers Series speaking on the topic of anticipating counter insurgency in Iraq. On September 10, 2002, Carr participated in the Bard&#x27;s Globalization and International Affairs Program panel discussions to mark the events of September 11, 2001, discussing the repercussions of the attacks on the World Trade Center, Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and the Pentagon. In 2013, Bard hosted a six-week academic exchange program on foreign policy with the U.S. State Department, titled, &quot;Grand Strategy in Context: Institutions, People, and the Making of U.S. Foreign Policy&quot;.

In 2005 Carr published &quot;The Italian Secretary&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Further Adventure of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The project was initially to be part of an anthology of new Sherlock Holmes stories by modern mystery writers. When asked why he took on this project, Carr responded, &quot;I think my interest in Holmes is probably like a lot of authors&#x27;. There are authors for whom the Holmes stories are part of the beginning of their decision to become writers, especially writers who aspire to popular fiction that has a bit more to it.&quot;

Carr&#x27;s next fiction endeavor, an ambitious volume he had been tinkering with since the 1980s, was published under the title &quot;The Legend of Broken&quot; in 2012. This work of speculative history set during a time period we know little about—the Dark Ages—imagines a multilayered tale where cultures collide in their bid to rule a kingdom where the borders of the natural world seem to almost bleed over into the unnatural, at times, although Carr was adamant in his declaration that the book was &quot;not&quot; a work of fantasy. The fictional kingdom of Broken occupies the part of modern Germany known as the Harz Mountains, in particular the mountain peak known as Brocken, which for centuries had been considered the seat of supernatural doings, because, Carr demonstrates, of the ignorance and superstition of man. As the book progresses we see how the word &quot;broken&quot; pertains, not only to the city, but also to the characters. The book is an allegory, a cautionary tale for our own time that &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared, &quot;an excellent and old-fashioned entertainment ... &quot;The Legend of Broken&quot; seamlessly blends epic adventure with serious research and asks questions that men and women grappled with in the Dark Ages and still do today.&quot;

Carr spent several years researching and writing his final novel, &quot;Surrender, New York&quot;, published August 23, 2016, by Penguin Random House. He stated, &quot;This book is essentially a modern application of the principles and theories of Dr. Laszlo Kreizler to criminal behavior especially that directed at children.&quot;

After many failed attempts at adapting &quot;The Alienist&quot; to film, Paramount announced, in the summer of 2015, that it had partnered with TNT to produce a TV series adaptation helmed by Cary Fukunaga, Emmy-winning director of &quot;True Detective&quot;. Carr, tentatively hired on (pending his approval of the final scripts produced) as a consulting producer, commented, &quot;After twenty years of tough struggle and countless failed attempts, I&#x27;m delighted that Paramount Television, Anonymous Content and TNT have decided to join forces and bring &#x27;The Alienist&#x27; to life in what, based on the material I&#x27;ve read, has the potential to be a faithful and exciting TV series.&quot; Hossein Amini, Gina Gionfriddo, E. Max Frye and John Sayles also joined the Paramount Television and Anonymous Content project as writers.

Carr consistently kept up his nonfiction writing, on terrorism, especially. In response to the continued threats from ISIS near the end of 2015 and early in 2016, for example, Carr published a quartet of essays embodying once again his roots as a noted military scholar. The first article, published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was &quot;If France Wants to Succeed against Islamic State, it should Study the U. S. Invasion of Afghanistan&quot;. That was followed by &quot;Let Europe Lead the War in Syria: History Counsels Caution for American Troops&quot;, published in the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;. Next, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published, &quot;The Frantic Media Response to San Bernardino is Making Us Less Safe;&quot; and most recently, the &quot;Daily News&quot; published another essay of Carr&#x27;s called, &quot;Strangling Isis, Slowly but Surely&quot; The last warned what Carr saw as an American public that has never fully recovered psychologically from the attacks of 9/11 that the Global War on Terrorism will never have &quot;a Hiroshima moment&quot;, and should not attempt one; instead, victory will only be gained patiently and over a span of decades..

=== Other work ===
While Carr&#x27;s early years at home were fraught with chaos and abuse, author James Chace, a childhood friend, stated the house was also &quot;full of learning ... The thing is, most people tend to be narrow. But all the Carrs know music incredibly well, history, literature—they&#x27;re extraordinarily remarkable.&quot; In the 1980s Carr pursued his career as a scholar and journalist; he spent his nights working in the theater directing both repertory works as well as productions of his own plays. Additionally, he played guitar in a band called Hell and High Water.

The late 1990s found Carr expanding his literary repertoire while working as librettist for the opera &quot;Merlin&quot;, a reinterpretation of the Arthurian legends, with his friend and composer, Ezequiel Vinao. A staged recital of the first scene was performed with a full orchestra at the Paris Opera House in 1999. The work is unfinished.

== Personal life and death ==
Carr lived most of his life on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, spending his summers and many weekends at his family&#x27;s home in Cherry Plain, New York. In 2000, he bought his own property, known as Misery Mountain, in Cherry Plain; and in 2006 he moved there permanently. He shared his home with his Siberian rescue cat, Masha, for 17 years. Masha died in April 2022. Caleb Carr revealed he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2024. He died at his home in Cherry Plain on May 23, at the age of 68.

<text>Hed PE (standing for &quot;Higher Education Planet Earth/Planetary Evolution&quot;, typeset as (həd)p.e., (hed) Planet Earth, (Hed)pe or (Hed)PE) is an American nu metal band from Huntington Beach, California. Formed in 1994, the band is known for its eclectic genre-crossing style, predominately in the fusion of gangsta rap and punk rock it has termed &quot;G-punk&quot;, but also for its reggae-fused music.

After releasing three albums on Jive Records, Hed PE left the label to record independently. Hed PE was signed with Suburban Noize Records from 2006 until 2010. Since 2006, the band has become known for its involvement in the 9/11 Truth movement, referencing it in many of their song lyrics and concerts, as well as the concept of the album &quot;New World Orphans&quot;. Since 2014, the band has been signed with Pavement Music.

To date, Hed PE has released fourteen studio albums, one live album and three compilation albums, and has sold over 700,000 albums worldwide.

==History==

===Formation and major-label debut (1994–1999)===
The band was formed by vocalist Jared Gomes, also known as &quot;M.C.U.D.&quot; (MC Underdog), and guitarist Wes Geer, who became friends amidst the Orange County hardcore punk scene. Gomes and Geer recruited guitarist Chizad, bassist Mawk, drummer B.C. Vaught and DJ Product © 1969. They named the group &quot;Hed&quot;, which was based on a song written by Gomes called &quot;Heavy Head&quot;. The band built a following with their energetic performances at local venues, and released the self-financed extended play, &quot;Church of Realities&quot;. Legal issues forced Hed to change their name, adding &quot;PE&quot;, which stood for &quot;Planetary Evolution (later changed to planet earth) &quot;.

Hed PE signed with Jive Records, releasing their self-titled debut album in 1997. In his review of the album, AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey wrote &quot;There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well with late-&#x27;90s metal and punk fans.&quot; Due to the label&#x27;s contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes is quoted as saying &quot;We had these romantic visions of the music industry, and we thought it would be cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also probably the worst thing that could have happened. [...] We&#x27;ve had offers from Sony and others that we can&#x27;t take because we owe Jive so much money.&quot;

===&quot;Broke&quot; and &quot;Blackout&quot; (2000–2004)===
On June 6, 2000, Hed PE appeared on the tribute album &quot;Nativity in Black II&quot;, covering Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot;. Hed PE released their second studio album, &quot;Broke&quot; on August 22, 2000. It peaked at No. 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while its first single, &quot;Bartender&quot;, peaked at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at No. 27 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason D. Taylor wrote: &quot;&quot;Broke&quot; may have not found as much success in the competitive mainstream market as some would have liked, and even despite its distinct departure from the group&#x27;s debut, it is an album that shows more vision than other rap-tinged rock albums to come out in 2000.&quot; The most negative response to the album came from critics who viewed its lyrics as misogynistic. Jared Gomes denied that he was sexist in a 2001 &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine feature about sexism in rock music, saying that some of his lyrics were deliberately controversial in order to provoke a reaction from people. He also noted that his lyrics offended other members in Hed PE, but they &quot;live[d] with it&quot;.

On October 27, 2000, Gomes was arrested for possession of marijuana while the band was performing in Waterbury, Connecticut. He was released on a US$1,500 bond. In 2001, Hed PE performed on the Ozzfest tour alongside bands such as Korn, Static-X, and System of a Down. A music video for &quot;Killing Time&quot;, the second single from &quot;Broke&quot;, was produced in promotion of the film &quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot;, which featured the song on its soundtrack.

Hed PE released their third studio album, &quot;Blackout&quot;, on March 18, 2003. It peaked at No. 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while its title track peaked at No. 21 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at No. 32 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Allmusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus wrote that &quot;While it expands on melodic elements that had previously played a supporting role in the band&#x27;s sound, &quot;Blackout&quot; also delivers truckloads of crushing guitar and pounding rhythm. And whether or not it is the presence of a top-line producer, (hed) pe have figured out a way to imbue their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip-hop with some serious hooks.&quot; Guitarist Jaxon joined the band in early 2004. He is the fourth person to fill this position.

===&quot;Only in Amerika&quot; (2004)===
Hed PE left Jive Records, releasing their fourth studio album, &quot;Only in Amerika&quot;, on Koch Records on October 19, 2004. It peaked at No. 20 on the Top Independent Albums chart and at No. 186 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In his review of the album, Johnny Loftus wrote &quot;It wants to be a confrontational megaphone in the ear of conservatives, but Jahred&#x27;s torrential rhetoric is too messy and blatantly offensive to incite anything but superficial anger, and the music – though occasionally explosive – takes a backseat to the ranting.&quot;

===Suburban Noize Records (2006–2010)===

In 2006, Hed PE signed with Suburban Noize Records, recording their fifth studio album, &quot;Back 2 Base X&quot;. The album was intended as a return to the basics of rock music, and did not rely as heavily on studio enhancement as previous releases. The album was released on June 6, 2006, the same day as &quot;The Best of (həd) Planet Earth&quot;, a compilation album produced by Jive Records without the band&#x27;s authorization or consent. &quot;Back 2 Base X&quot; peaked at No. 12 on the Independent Albums chart, and at No. 154 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Allmusic&#x27;s Rob Theakston wrote that &quot;&quot;Back 2 Base X&quot; suffers from the same problems as &quot;Amerika&quot;: it tries to be conceptual in thought à la Tool and vicious in its political commentary à la Fugazi or System of a Down, but somehow falls short by sounding like an angry stoner on a soapbox. It won&#x27;t win any new fans, but existing fans of (hed) pe&#x27;s work won&#x27;t be turning their backs away from the band in anger anytime soon, either.&quot;

On June 26, 2007, the band released their sixth studio album, &quot;Insomnia&quot;. It peaked at No. 16 on the Independent Albums chart, and at No. 138 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Suffa&quot;, became one of the most requested tracks at Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s Hard Attack, while the song&#x27;s music video was voted one of the Top 10 of 2007 on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. Hed PE released their first live album, &quot;The D.I.Y. Guys&quot;, in 2008. On December 20, 2008, Hed PE released their new single &quot;Renegade&quot; with the drummer Christopher Hendrich who appeared in the music video as well. On January 13, 2009, they released their seventh studio album, &quot;New World Orphans&quot;. It was released in three different versions; each contains a different set of bonus tracks. In 2009, drummer Trauma joined the band. He is the sixth person to fill this position. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Truth Rising&quot;, was released on October 26, 2010, to mixed reviews. It would be the last album the band recorded for Suburban Noize, which Gomes described as having &quot;imploded on itself&quot; approximately around 2010, leaving the band without a label for the next four years.

===&quot;Evolution&quot; and &quot;Forever!&quot; (2014–2019)===
Hed PE subsequently signed with Pavement Music. In a 2012 interview, frontman Jared Gomes stated that their album for 2013 titled &quot;Ascension&quot; would be released within the first half of 2014. Towards the end of 2013, DJ Product mysteriously left the band with no explanation and no comment from the other members. On January 1, 2014, Gomes stated on the band&#x27;s official Facebook that the new upcoming (hed) PE album will be named &quot;Evolution&quot; and to be released within the year.

On May 13, 2014, On the band&#x27;s official Facebook page, they released the official announcement of when the band&#x27;s new album Evolution will hit stores. The album is set for release July 22, 2014. They also released a teaser of the tone of the new album on their Facebook page and soon after, the track &quot;One More Body&quot;.

In 2015, it was confirmed that 12-year guitarist Jaxon Benge and original bassist Mark Young had left the band. They were replaced by guitarist Greg &quot;Gregzilla&quot; Harrison and bassist Kurt &quot;Kid Bass&quot; Blankenship, leaving vocalist Jared Gomes as the group&#x27;s only remaining original member.

=== &quot;Stampede!&quot;, &quot;Class of 2020&quot;, &quot;Sandmine&quot;, &quot;Califas Worldwide&quot; and &quot;Detox&quot; (2019–present) ===
On June 21, 2019, the band released a new 10-track album titled &quot;Stampede!&quot;, which was noted for taking a departure from the style of their previous albums through the inclusion of auto-tune on many of the tracks. In August 2020, Hed PE released the album &quot;Class of 2020&quot; which was described as a return to the original G-punk sound of the band. The record saw a reunion with original guitarist Chad &quot;Chizad&quot; Benekos for the first time in nearly two decades, who performed in the song &quot;Greedy Girl&quot;. Original member DJ Product © 1969 also returned to play on the album as well as create the artwork for the record which was a throwback to their album &quot;Broke&quot; to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its release. On May 7, 2021, the band announced the extended play &quot;Sandmine&quot;, which was released on July 23, 2021. On October 22 of the same year, the band announced the studio album &quot;Califas Worldwide&quot;, which was released on December 17, 2021. For the 20th anniversary of Broke, on April 8, 2022, the band released &quot;Bartenders&quot;, a remake of &quot;Bartender&quot; featuring Dropout Kings and DJ Lethal. On October 14, 2022, the band released a rerecorded version of their song &quot;Let&#x27;s Ride&quot; with Madchild for a deluxe edition of their album &quot;Back 2 Base X&quot;. On February 5, 2023, the band released a cover of the Ramones song &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot;. During that same year, Hed PE released three singles, &quot;Detox&quot;, &quot;Too Late&quot; and &quot;Waiting&quot;, from their next studio album &quot;Detox&quot;, due on December 15, 2023.

==Style==

===Music and lyrics===
Hed PE performs a style of music which they have referred to as &quot;G-punk&quot;, a phrase inspired by the term &quot;G-funk&quot;. Hed PE has also described its music as &quot;schizophrenic&quot;. Hed PE&#x27;s music is a fusion of styles ranging from hip hop, reggae, and ska to hard rock, punk, and heavy metal. Jared Gomes&#x27; vocal style ranges from melodic singing to rapping, screaming, and death growls. The band&#x27;s lyrics draw on a number of subjects, including social justice, the existence of extraterrestrial life, criticism of organized religion, the 9/11 Truth movement, cannabis use and sexual intercourse.

Gomes, in addition to the 9/11 Truth movement, has expressed support for social liberal politicians such as Nancy Pelosi and president Barack Obama. However, Gomes&#x27; 2004 lyrics for &quot;Only in Amerika&quot; supported American nationalism, and called for brutal retaliation against Al Qaeda for the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

===Influences===
The band&#x27;s influences include Beastie Boys, Black Sabbath, Bob Marley, Led Zeppelin, Nine Inch Nails, Notorious B.I.G. and Rage Against the Machine.

Hed PE&#x27;s second album, &quot;Broke&quot;, incorporated classic rock and world music influences, while &quot;Back 2 Base X&quot; was influenced by classic punk bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Clash, &quot;Insomnia&quot; was influenced by thrash metal bands such as Slayer, and &quot;New World Orphans&quot; was influenced by Suicidal Tendencies and Minor Threat. Guitarist Jaxon has been credited for encouraging a heavier, hardcore punk-influenced musical style.

<doc id="581035" wikidata="Q544981" url="?curid=581035" title="Saint Marinus">
<text>Marinus (; ) was an Early Christian and the founder of a chapel and monastery in 301 from whose initial community the state of San Marino later grew.

==Life==
Tradition holds that he was a stonemason by trade who came from the island of Arba (today Rab), on the other side of the Adriatic Sea (in what is now part of modern-day Croatia, then part of the Roman Empire), fleeing persecution for his Christian beliefs in the Diocletianic Persecution. 
Known only by the single name &quot;Marinus&quot; (lit. of the sea), he was ordained a deacon by Gaudentius of Rimini; later, he was recognised and accused by an insane woman of being her estranged husband, so he quickly fled to Monte Titano to build a chapel-monastery and live as a hermit. 

Another version of the story says that hearing that the town of Rimini (Italy) was being rebuilt, he travelled there and was astonished to find among the workmen many Christians of formerly high position who had been sentenced to hard labour because of their refusal to sacrifice to the gods. He sought to comfort them and to alleviate their sufferings, so far as was in his power.

In his old age Marinus withdrew to a hermitage and decided to seclude himself on Mount Titano, living the life of a hermit in holy contemplation. As his reputation for his sanctity grew, others started to follow him there, until finally a lady from Rimini and the owner of Mount Titano decided to gift him the mountain.

Marinus was canonised as a saint, and later, the State of San Marino grew up from the centre created by the monastery. His feast day/memorial day is 3 September, commemorating the day, in 301, when he founded what became known as San Marino, which is also the state&#x27;s national holiday. He is venerated in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox faiths.

According to legend, he died in the winter of 366 and his last words were: &quot;&quot; (&quot;I leave you free from both men&quot;). This somewhat mysterious phrase is most likely to refer to the two &quot;men&quot; from whose oppressive power Marinus had decided to separate himself, becoming a hermit on Mount Titano: respectively the Emperor and the Pope. This affirmation of freedom (first and foremost fiscal franchise) from both the Empire and the Papal States, however legendary, has always been the inspiration of the tiny republic.

==Sources==

The earliest manuscripts mentioning Marinus and his life date to the 10th century. Another principal source of the events of Marinus&#x27;s life were compiled in the Acta Sanctorum.

<doc id="581037" wikidata="Q7307410" url="?curid=581037" title="Reform Party of British Columbia">
<text>The Reform Party of British Columbia (Reform BC) is an unregistered right-wing populist political party in British Columbia, Canada. Although its name is similar to the defunct Reform Party of Canada, the provincial party was founded before the federal party was and it did not have any formal association with it. Their peak of support came in 1996 when they elected two members to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.

== Founding ==
The party was founded in 1982 as the Referendum Party and then registered as Reform BC with the B.C. Corporations Branch in 1983. The party&#x27;s first candidates ran in the 1991 provincial election, when four candidates stood in the 75 ridings, receiving 2,673 votes, or 0.18% of the popular vote. That election saw the collapse of the British Columbia Social Credit Party, which was reduced to seven Members of the Legislative Assembly, four of these seven defected to Reform BC. This was done in part to capitalize on the popularity of the Reform Party of Canada. Despite attempts to take over Social Credit, Reform BC was unable to absorb it and lay claim to the right of the political spectrum.

In the May 28, 1996 election, the party nominated candidates in all of the province’s 75 ridings, and collected 146,734 votes (9.27% of the popular vote). Two party members were elected to office, but they won no further seats in subsequent elections.

== Decline ==
Many blamed Reform for splitting the right-wing vote and helping the New Democratic Party of British Columbia under Glen Clark get re-elected. The leader, Jack Weisgerber decided to step down as leader. At the August 30, 1997 leadership convention in Surrey, Wilf Hanni was elected leader over John Motiuk and Adrian Wade. Hanni, an oil industry worker, alienated both of the MLAs and drove them out of the party. Richard Neufeld crossed to the BC Liberals, and became a provincial cabinet minister before being appointed to the Canadian Senate on the recommendation of Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2008. Jack Weisgerber would later become a director for BC Hydro, the power utility owned by the provincial government. The loss of the two MLAs was the effective end of the party.

== Failed merger into BC Unity ==
Following Hanni&#x27;s resignation, at the November 12–13, 1999 leadership convention, former Social Credit premier Bill Vander Zalm was acclaimed as leader of the party. Vander Zalm attempted to orchestrate a merger of Reform with other right-wing parties, but ran into stiff opposition from a centrist old guard. Following some controversy over paperwork submission deadlines, the Reform Party was de-registered as a BC political party in February 2001. At the time, they were in second place in the polls, with a one percentage point lead over the NDP, and had been in second place for the previous year.

The Vander Zalm wing of the party later joined form the BC Unity Party, with members of four other right-wing parties (the British Columbia Social Credit Party, the British Columbia Conservative Party, the British Columbia Party, and the Family Coalition Party of British Columbia) to while other members re-registered &quot;Reform BC&quot; and swung back to the political centre.

In the 2001 provincial election, the Reform Party nominated eight candidates, receiving a total of 3,008 votes (0.22% of the total vote). In five ridings, Reform received over 2% of the vote, its best result being in Surrey-Green Timbers, where the party won 3.5% of the vote.

== Failed merger into Democratic Reform BC ==
In 2004, Reform BC became involved in efforts to create a new centrist coalition. On January 16, 2005, the Democratic Reform British Columbia (DRBC) party was created, taking much of Reform&#x27;s executive with it. Other members of the party, however, have decided to continue Reform BC.

The difference of opinion between the group that left for DRBC and those continuing Reform BC appears to revolve around three issues:

* Reform BC rejects the current referendum on Electoral Reform, whereas DRBC supports it.
* Reform BC rejects guaranteeing four seats in the Legislature exclusively for First Nations (aboriginal) people.
* Reform BC rejects the Kyoto Accord.

The party nominated one candidate to contest the 2005 election: Ron Gamble won 344 votes (1.76% of the total) in North Vancouver-Lonsdale. Under the leadership of David Charles Hawkins, BC Reform nominated four candidates in the 2009 election. None was elected. They won a total of 1,106 votes.

* Jack Weisgerber (January 1995 – February 1997)
* Wilf Hanni (August 1997 – June 1998)
