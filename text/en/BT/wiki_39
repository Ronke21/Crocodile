<text>Mossley Association Football Club is a football club in Mossley, Greater Manchester, England. Nicknamed &quot;the Lilywhites&quot; after the white shirts adopted in 1912, they are currently members of the and play at Seel Park.

==History==
The club was established as Park Villa. After a season of playing friendlies and cup matches, they were renamed Mossley Juniors in 1904 and joined the Stalybridge &amp; District League. In their first competitive league match the club lost 9–1 to Dunham Villa, but they recovered to beat Mossley Volunteers 2–1 the following week. The club transferred to the Ashton, Dunkinfield &amp; District League in 1907, and then the Oldham &amp; District League in 1907 and the West End Amateur League in 1908. In 1909 they were renamed Mossley Association Football Club and joined Division Two of the Ashton &amp; District League. They finished joint top of the table in 1909–10 before losing a championship play-off match 3–2 to Ashton St Peter&#x27;s reserves. However, they did win the Ashton Junior Cup. The league was reduced to a single division the following season, with Mossley continuing as members. They won the league in 1911–12 and were runners-up in the next two seasons, also winning the Lady Aitken League Cup in 1913–14, beating Droylsden in a second replay.

Mossley were Ashton &amp; District League champions again in 1914–15, also winning the League Cup and the Manchester Junior Cup. In 1915 they joined the South East Lancashire League. However, despite leading the league in January, club officials decided to disband due to the war. They reformed for the 1916–17 and joined the Manchester Amateur League, but disbanded again in January 1917. The club was resurrected again in December 1918 and joined the Manchester Section of the Lancashire Combination for the truncated 1919 season, going on to finish as runners-up. Later in 1919 Mossley were founder members of the Cheshire County League, finishing as runners-up in the league and losing the League Cup final in the 1919–20 season. They won the League Cup the following season. In 1933–34 the club won the Manchester Junior Cup for a second time. They subsequently won Manchester Shield in 1937–38.

Following World War II Mossley finished bottom of the league in 1945–46. The 1949–50 season saw the club reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. After beating Witton Albion 1–0, they lost 3–0 to Nuneaton Borough in a second round replay. In 1960–61 the club won the League Cup and the Manchester Intermediate Cup, winning the latter trophy again in 1966–67 and 1967–68. They reached the first round of the FA Cup again in 1969–70, losing 1–0 to Stockport County in a replay, before going on to finish as runners-up in the league. After winning the Manchester Senior Cup in 1971–72, they moved up to the Northern Premier League. The club won the Senior Cup for a second time in 1976–77. Another appearance in the FA Cup first round in 1977–78 saw them lose 3–0 to Rotherham United. However, the season ended with the club winning the Northern Premier League title and the League Cup. However, they were unable to be promoted to the Alliance Premier League as their ground did not meet the requirements. The club were subsequently invited to play in a Non League Champion of Champions Cup match at the start of the following season, but were beaten by Southern League champions Worcester City over two legs.

Mossley retained their league title in 1979–80. They also reached the FA Cup first round again, losing 5–2 to York City, as well as reaching the final of the FA Trophy, in which they were beaten 2–1 by Dagenham at Wembley Stadium. The club defeated Football League opposition in the FA Cup for the first time the following season, beating Crewe Alexandra 1–0 before losing 3–1 at home to Mansfield Town in the second round. They went on to finish as runners-up in the league, which they repeated in each of the next two seasons, as well as making further FA Cup first round appearances which ended in defeat by Stockport and Huddersfield Town. Although the club reached the FA Cup first round again in 1983–84 (losing to 5–0 Darlington), they also finished bottom of the Northern Premier League, marking the end of their period of success.

The Northern Premier League gained a second division in 1987, with Mossley becoming members of the Premier Division. They won the League Cup and the Manchester Premier Cup in 1988–89, before winning the league&#x27;s Challenge Shield in 1989–90 and the Manchester Premier Cup in 1990–91. However, the club were relegated to Division One at the end of the 1992–93 season, and then finished bottom of Division One in 1994–95, resulting in relegation to Division One of the North West Counties League (which had been formed by merger of the Cheshire County League and the Lancashire Combination in 1982). They were Division One runners-up in 1998–99 and won the League Cup in 2002–03, before finishing as runners-up in Division One again the following season, earning promotion back to Division One of the Northern Premier League.

Mossley were Division One champions in 2005–06 and were promoted to the Premier Division. However, they were relegated at the end of the following season, at which point the club were placed in Division One North. The club won the Manchester Premier Cup in 2011–12, and retained it the following season, which also saw the club finish fifth in the league, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, they were beaten 1–0 by Cammell Laird in the semi-finals. The club won the Premier Cup again in 2014–15 and 2015–16.

==Ground==
The club initially played at a former rugby ground in Luzley, earning the nickname the &#x27;Luzleyites&#x27;. Seats were installed on the eastern side of the pitch and some at the southern end. In 1912 they moved to Seel Fold, which had previously been used as a rubbish tip and then a cricket field, using the adjacent Highland Laddie Hotel as their headquarters. The opening match was played on 23 September, a 4–0 win for Mossley against Stalybridge St Peters in the Ashton &amp; District League. A record attendance of over 3,000 was set for a local derby against Mossley Celtic in the 1913–14 season. A 430-capacity stand was built on the Popular Side in 1920, with terracing installed on the same side in 1922. The stand was expanded to a capacity of 1,000 in 1927, with the ground becoming known as Seel Park in 1931. A new stand was built at the Mossley Park end in 1932 and a 300-seat stand erected on the Market Street side of the pitch four years later. The club&#x27;s record attendance of 6,640 was set in 1946 for a Cheshire County League match against local rivals Stalybridge Celtic.

Mossley purchased the ground from Stamford Estates in 1948 for £1,200. The Popular Side stand was demolished in 1969 and replaced in 1971 when the club sold Gary Pierce to Huddersfield Town. Floodlights were installed the following year. A stand was built at the Park End in 1980. In 1987 the main stand had to be demolished due to storm damage, and was replaced with a 220-seat stand which was named for club president James Anderson. The ground was sold in 1988 to clear the club&#x27;s debts, with Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council becoming owners in 1990. The installation of new terracing began in 1996 and finished in 2008 when the Hanover Street side was completed.

==Early life and education==
Hendricks was raised in a small conservative town in Western Michigan. He remarked that he spent much of his early life in a state of &quot;quasi-shame&quot; and in &quot;a stealth existence&quot; due to being gay. Hendricks attended Michigan State University as a pre-med student before switching from medicine to a degree in social psychology. He later found that while the majority of social scientists worked in academia, he preferred clinical work under the Boulder model. He completed a master&#x27;s thesis focused on HIV. Hendricks earned a doctorate in clinical psychology from American University. His dissertation, published in 1993, is titled &quot;The occurrence of suicidal ideation over the course of HIV infection in gay men: A cross-sectional study&quot;. His doctoral advisor was Alan Berman.

==Career==
At the beginning of his career in the early 1990s, the HIV/AIDS crisis influenced Hendricks to address LGBTQ issues. He is a clinician and researcher and has investigated depression, suicide, substance abuse, compulsive behaviors, HIV, and gender diversity issues at the National Cancer Institute, Georgetown University Medical Center, and Virginia Commonwealth University. Since 1999, he has worked as a partner at the Washington Psychological Center, P.C. He has worked in various facilities including Spring Grove Hospital Center and Whitman-Walker Health. He was a Chief Psychologist at Umoja Methadone treatment Center and was Chief of Outpatient Mental Health Services at the Washington, D.C. He is board certified in clinical psychology from by the American Board of Professional Psychology.

Hendricks is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (APA), the Society for the Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity, the Society of Clinical Psychology, and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. He was the chair of the Research Committee of the Virginia HIV Community Planning Committee for 11 years. Hendricks is an APA Council representative and past president of Division 44, which is the APA&#x27;s Society for the Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity. He has held positions as adjunct professor in at Argosy University, Howard University, and Catholic University of America., where he has taught graduate-level Clinical Psychopharmacology. He is the lead author, with co-author Rylan Testa on the seminal paper that applied Ilan Meyer&#x27;s minority stress model to transgender people, published in 2012. He was awarded an APA Presidential Citation.

Hendricks is a member of and is a certified healthcare provider of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, American Psychology-Law Society, and the American Association of Suicidology.

==Personal life==
Hendricks had a &quot;stealth&quot; lifestyle as a gay man while living in a small town in Michigan. He is currently &quot;very out&quot;.

<doc id="569796" wikidata="Q541460" url="?curid=569796" title="John Smith (Ohio politician, died 1824)">
<text>John Smith (July 30, 1824) was one of the first two U.S. senators from the state of Ohio. He reluctantly resigned from the Senate under charges of alleged complicity in the Burr conspiracy.

Little is known of his early life. There are conflicting reports on the location of his birth, with some sources saying he was born in the Province of Virginia, and others saying Hamilton County, Ohio (which did not exist until 1790); the identity of his parents are unknown. He prepared for the ministry, and was pastor of the Baptist Church at Columbia, Miami Purchase, Northwest Territory, during the 1790s which some sources credit as the first Baptist Church in modern Ohio. He then began a profitable business supplying military posts near Cincinnati, Ohio. He also ran multiple grain mills. In 1799 Smith along with his agent Reuben Kemper were the first US-based merchants to ship to Baton Rouge, taking nearly $10,000 worth of goods, primarily fine clothing and house furnishings.

He was a member of the Northwest Territorial legislature 1799–1803 and a delegate to the Ohio state constitutional convention in 1802. He was a leader of a group that supported statehood in opposition to the Territorial Governor Arthur St. Clair. Upon the admission of Ohio as a State into the Union, he was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States Senate and served in the 8th, 9th and 10th Congresses (1803–1808).

While in the Senate, Smith continued his profitable trading ventures in Louisiana and West Florida and pursued numerous land investment ventures. In 1805, former Vice President Aaron Burr sought his support in organizing a military expedition against Spanish Florida. Although Smith claimed he had no interest in Burr&#x27;s plot to force secession of Spanish territories, he agreed to provide supplies for the proposed expedition. When President Thomas Jefferson later issued an alert, charging that Burr&#x27;s actual purpose was an invasion of Mexico, Smith responded patriotically by financing weapons to defend against the Burr expedition and delivering those weapons to New Orleans. These travels caused him to miss weeks of Senate sessions and led the Ohio legislature to charge him with dereliction of duty and to demand his resignation.

Although Smith ignored that demand, he found his troubles increasing as a court in Richmond, Virginia, indicted him in mid-1807 for participating in Burr&#x27;s conspiracy. As he traveled to Richmond, he learned that the charges against him were dropped after the court acquitted Burr on a technicality.

But on December 31, 1807, a Senate committee chaired by John Quincy Adams recommended that Smith be expelled from the Senate. A trial was held in 1808, with Adams leading the attack. Smith was defended by Francis Scott Key and Robert Goodloe Harper, who argued that Smith may have been naive, but was not a traitor. The expulsion resolution fell one vote short of the required two-thirds majority. Smith resigned on April 25, the last day that Congress was in session for the year.

Smith had enjoyed a close friendship with President Thomas Jefferson early in his Senate career, though that relationship was ruined, along with Smith&#x27;s political career, by his implication in the Burr treason. Smith was forced into bankruptcy and later moved to St. Francisville, Louisiana, where he served as a Methodist preacher.

The &quot;History of Cincinnati and Hamilton County Ohio&quot;, published in 1894, indicates that Smith died in Hamilton County, Ohio on June 10, 1816, although this is apparently incorrect, since an obituary and later sources agree on his death in 1824 in St. Francisville, Louisiana.

<text>BBC Radio Leeds is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of West Yorkshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at St Peter&#x27;s Square in Leeds.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 178,000 listeners and a 2.8% share as of December 2023.

==History==

The station began broadcasting at the Merrion Centre at 5.30 pm on 24 June 1968, becoming the seventh BBC local radio station to go on air. Initially a two-year experiment and co-funded by Leeds City Council, the station was only available in Leeds on a low powered 50 watt VHF transmitter in Meanwood Park, on 94.6 MHz. Listening figures were very low as at that time, the majority of listeners still listened to radio via AM. In 1970, the station was made permanent and began broadcasting to all of West Yorkshire from the Holme Moss transmitting station and in 1972 the station started broadcasting on medium wave and branded itself as &quot;the voice of West Yorkshire&quot;.

In 1974, BBC Radio Leeds, along with &quot;BBC Look North&quot;, moved to new studios in Woodhouse Lane, where it remained for thirty years until the studios were demolished in 2004.

Until the mid 1980s, the station was generally on air from breakfast until teatime, with any programming after 6 pm devoted to specialist music and magazines aimed at specialist interests and at ethnic minority communities. These programmes did not broadcast all year round, and outside of its broadcast hours, as with all BBC Local Radio stations, Radio Leeds carried BBC Radio 2.

In August 1986, evening programmes began on a permanent basis when the station joined with the other three BBC stations in Yorkshire to provide an early evening service of specialist music programmes on weeknights from 6 pm to 7:30 pm, although since autumn 1984, BBC Radio Leeds&#x27; Saturday evening organ music programme, &quot;At the Console&quot;, had also been carried by BBC Radio York and BBC Radio Humberside. The regional specialist music service was expanded in September 1987, running six days a week (Wednesday to Monday) between 7 pm and 9 pm, with Tuesdays reserved for local sports coverage.

On 29 May 1989, the BBC Night Network launched which saw the six BBC Local Radio stations in Yorkshire and the north east broadcasting networked programming every evening from 6:05 pm (6 pm at the weekend) and midnight, with the majority of the programmes broadcast from the Leeds studios. Any local programming broadcast after 6 pm, such as sport and ethnic minority output, was transmitted only on medium wave with &quot;Night Network&quot; continuing uninterrupted on FM. The network expanded in May 1991 to include the four BBC North West stations and &quot;Night Network&quot;&#x27;s hours were changed, starting an hour later, resulting in an additional hour of local output. Programming was overhauled with specialist music programmes airing from 7:05 pm to 10 pm (the exception being made for midweek sports coverage) followed, on weeknights, by a late show from Lancaster. The late show was extended to 12:30 am a year later and eventually to 1 am. Local programming would now fully opt-out of the network with any local evening programming replacing the scheduled Night Network programme on both FM and AM.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the station was branded as &quot;West Yorkshire&#x27;s FM BBC Radio Leeds&quot;
In 2002, the Yorkshire stations left the network to introduce a regional phone-in show with Alex Hall, who had hosted a similar show on Pulse.

In 2012, the station closed its offices and studios at the National Media Museum in Bradford, where the public was able to see programmes being broadcast. Radio Leeds also ran district newsrooms and contribution studios in Wakefield Town Hall, at Dean Clough in Halifax and at Huddersfield Town Hall. Four years later, the station reinstated an office and studio in Bradford, located in the Horton building at The University of Bradford.

As a cost saving measure, all local early evening programmes were scrapped at the start of 2013 and they were replaced by a new evening programme which was broadcast on all local stations (the only time that stations were not able to broadcast the programme was to provide local sports coverage). BBC Radio Leeds was the location of the national programme. The late show was a regional programme. The programme continued until summer 2018, almost a year after the then Director-General of the BBC, Tony Hall, announced in a speech to mark BBC Local Radio&#x27;s 50th anniversary that the national evening show would be axed, resulting in local programming returning to weeknight evenings.

===BBC Radio Bradford===
On 7 December 2020, BBC Radio Bradford began broadcasting as a temporary service on the MW frequency each weekday between 6 am and 2 pm. The service provided eight hours of opt-out programming for listeners in Bradford and the surrounding area each weekday until March 2021.

==Technical==
The main VHF / FM transmitter is located at the Holme Moss transmitting station on 92.4 MHz, covering most of West Yorkshire.

Radio Leeds is also carried on the Halifax, Wharfedale and Luddenden relay transmitters on 95.3 MHz, from Keighley on 102.7 MHz and from Beecroft Hill (West Leeds) on 103.9 MHz to fill in areas which are screened from Holme Moss by the topology of the area.

Since 2001, BBC Radio Leeds has been carried on the Bauer Leeds DAB multiplex, and since October 2002, on the Bradford &amp; Huddersfield multiplex.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 711 in the BBC Yorkshire region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

BBC Radio Leeds was also broadcast on 774 kHz medium wave from a transmitter located at Farnley. It used to simulcast the BBC Asian Network every evening. MW transmissions ended on 1 June 2021.

==Programming==

Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Leeds studios from 6 am to 2 pm each day and for sports coverage. The late show, airing from 10 pm to 1 am, is broadcast from Manchester or London.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Leeds simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

===Sports coverage===
BBC Radio Leeds broadcasts live sport under the &quot;West Yorkshire Sport&quot; banner. Football coverage includes Leeds United, Huddersfield Town and Bradford City. Rugby league coverage includes Leeds Rhinos, Bradford Bulls, Huddersfield Giants, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats and Castleford Tigers. The station covers Yorkshire Carnegie in rugby union and Yorkshire County Cricket Club in cricket.

<doc id="569803" wikidata="Q2240567" url="?curid=569803" title="Moss Side">
<text>Moss Side is an inner-city area of Manchester, England, south of the city centre, It had a population of 20,745 at the 2021 census. Moss Side is bounded by Hulme to the north, Chorlton-on-Medlock, Rusholme and Fallowfield to the east, Whalley Range to the south, and Old Trafford to the west.

As well as Whitworth Park and Alexandra Park, Moss Side is close to Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan universities. Manchester City played at Maine Road in Moss Side between 1923 and 2003.

==History==
Historically part of Lancashire, Moss Side was a rural township and chapelry within the parish of Manchester and hundred of Salford. Thought to be named after a great moss which stretched from Rusholme to Chorlton-cum-Hardy, the earliest mention of the area is in 1533 when it contained part of the estates of Trafford. Moss Side is described in the opening chapter of Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;Mary Barton&quot; as a rural idyll with a &#x27;deep clear pool&#x27; and an old black and white timber-framed farmhouse, later identified as Pepperhill Farm. Following the Industrial Revolution there was a process of unplanned urbanisation and a rapid increase in population size. In 1866 Moss Side became a separate civil parish, from 1894 to 1904 Moss Side was an urban district, on 1 October 1910 the parish was abolished and merged with South Manchester. The population in 1801 was 151 but by 1901 he parish population had increased to 26,677. The industrial growth of the area resulted in a densely populated area, so much so, that a part of the township of Moss Side was amalgamated into the expanding city of Manchester in 1885, with the rest joining in 1904.

Mass development in Moss Side occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when large numbers of red brick terraced houses were built, and soon attracted numerous Irish immigrants and other working people.

Manchester City F.C. moved to a new stadium on Maine Road on 25 August 1923, having moved from Hyde Road, Ardwick; on its opening it was one of the most capacious sports stadiums in the United Kingdom, capable of holding up to 85,000 spectators. The club would play there for the next 80 years.

During the Manchester Blitz in the Second World War many of the terraced houses were damaged by German bombing on the night of 22/23 December 1940. Migrants from the Indian subcontinent and Caribbean settled in the locality during the 1950s and 1960s, and by the 1980s Moss Side was the hub of Manchester&#x27;s Afro-Caribbean community. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Manchester City Council demolished many of the Victorian and terraced houses to the west of Moss Side and replaced these with new council houses and flats. Most of the newer properties, built around the turn of the 20th century, were refurbished instead of demolished during the final two decades of the century.

In 1981, the Moss Side area was one of England&#x27;s inner city areas affected by a series of riots. Analysts trace the 1970s origins of Manchester&#x27;s gang crime to social deprivation in the south-central part of the city – Hulme, Longsight and Moss Side – where the activity of the underground economy encouraged a trade in illegal narcotics and firearms contributing to Manchester&#x27;s later nickname of &quot;Gunchester&quot;. &quot;Turf wars&quot; between rival drugs &#x27;gangs&#x27;, resulted in a high number of fatal shootings. During what has been termed the Madchester phase of the history of Manchester, narcotic trade in the city became &quot;extremely lucrative&quot; and in the early 1990s a gang war started between two groups vying for control of the market in Manchester city centre – the &#x27;Cheetham Hill Gang&#x27; and &#x27;The Gooch Close Gang&#x27;, in Cheetham Hill and Moss Side, respectively. There were several high-profile shootings associated with gangs and drugs in this area during the 1990s and into the 21st century. Aided by the work of Xcalibre, the Greater Manchester Police&#x27;s task force, founded in 2004, and the multiagency Integrated Gang Management Unit, gang related shootings in the area have fallen by about 90% in recent years.

Many of the flats in neighbouring Hulme were demolished in the early 1990s to make way for new low rise homes. Housing on the Alexandra Park Estate in the west of Moss Side has been renovated and the streets redesigned to reduce the fear of crime.

The majority of Moss Side is part of the Manchester Central constituency, represented by the Labour Party MP Lucy Powell. Following boundary changes in 2018 a portion of the ward is a part of the Manchester Gorton constituency, represented by the Labour Party MP Afzal Khan.

;Councillors 
Moss Side is a ward within the local authority of Manchester City Council. The ward is represented by Labour Councillors: Mahadi Hussein Sharif Mahamed (Lab), Emily Rowles (Lab), and Erinma Bell (Lab).
 indicates seat up for re-election.

==Geography==

Moss Side lies either side of the A5103 (Princess Road), the main road out of Manchester towards Northenden, Manchester Airport, the M56 motorway and Chester. Parallel to this is Alexandra Road, which continues as Alexandra Road South past Alexandra Park (Alexandra Road was formerly one of two main shopping streets in Moss Side). Landmarks on Princess Road are the Royal Brewery and the Princess Road Bus Depot, built originally for the tramways in 1909 and used by Stagecoach Manchester until 2010.

The western border of the Moss Side Ward is bounded in part by Withington Road. Parts of the eastern border are bounded by Wilmslow Road, where it meets Whitworth Park, and Parkfield Street. To the south, the border includes Alexandra Park, Horton Road and part of Platt Lane. To the north, the ward border mainly runs along Moss Lane East.

The built environment of Moss Side is broadly characterised as a high-density residential area. This includes mainly Victorian and Edwardian terraces to the east and centre, with more recent developments, primarily the Alexandra Park Estate, built in the 1970s to the west of Princess Road.

The Moss Side Sports and Leisure Complex (north of Moss Lane West) was upgraded for the 2002 Commonwealth Games and has a gym and a variety of other sporting facilities.

==Redevelopment and regeneration==
Moss Side has benefited from very substantial redevelopment and regeneration since the mid-1990s including improvement of the existing housing and residential environment along with several major housing projects currently in process or nearing completion. There has been considerable renovation of existing housing stock, such as local terrace housing and the Alexandra Park Estate.

A large site on Great Western Street has been developed by Moss Care Housing Ltd. to provide a mix of 2, 3 and 4-bedroom properties, with different tenures, some rental and others offered as shared ownership or for sale.

The former Manchester City F.C. Maine Road site is in the process of redevelopment, marketed as Maine Place, primarily as 2, 3 and 4-bedroom houses but including a limited number of flats, for sale or shared ownership, with many homes completed and occupied, along with a primary school, now open, and a health centre planned.

The Bowes Street area, adjoining Princess Road, has been redeveloped, at the cost of £17 million, including the renovation or transformation, with some new build, of 155 properties in five streets. Reported as being &#x27;built or converted to a very high standard of eco-friendliness, with solar panels, water butts, thermal &quot;skin&quot; insulation and sun pipes being used&#x27; and aiming to offer 2, 3 and 4-bedroom homes with &#x27;low running costs&#x27;, the development plan states its aim, along with that at Maine Road, as being to provide mixed type &quot;higher specification&quot; housing, &quot;diversify tenure&quot; and promote the area as a &quot;neighbourhood of choice&quot;.

Marketed as &quot;Infusion Homes&quot;, the properties were launched on the market on 26 February 2011. On 9 May, sales demand was reported as strong, with 60% of the properties having been sold. On 11 May the development was awarded the UK&#x27;s &quot;Best Affordable Housing Scheme&quot; at the national Housing Excellence Awards 2011

Land adjacent to the development, formerly occupied by Bilsborrow primary school and the Stagecoach bus depot, both demolished as part of regeneration, remains vacant with no clear future use at present, though local community groups have short term plans to use the space for a gardening/food growing project.

The impact of regeneration and redevelopment in changing perceptions of the area was demonstrated in &quot;The Guardian&quot; Saturday magazine, dated 8 September 2012, when Moss Side appeared in the long running &quot;Let&#x27;s Move To&quot; series.

==Industry==

===Brewing===
Moss Side has a long history of brewing, dating from the 19th century.
The Royal Brewery has had several owners, previously brewing brands such as Kestrel, McEwan&#x27;s and Harp Lager and is now owned by Heineken for the production of Foster&#x27;s Lager. There has been a brewery on this site since 1875. Originally built as the Albert Brewery, by 1915 it had become known as the Moss Side Brewery. A report in the 1880s commented:

&quot;The water at the brewery is of exceptionally good quality, containing all the necessary elements for producing the finest ales, which cannot be surpassed in the district for their brightness, purity and flavour&quot;.

The brewery was later acquired by Walker and Homfrays and merged into Wilsons in 1949. The brewery again merged with Websters brewery in 1985, was sold to Courage in 1990, before takeover by Heineken in 2008. Prior to its expansion, part of the site of the Royal Brewery, where Moss Lane East meets Princess Road, was occupied by a library, fire station and police station.

Hydes Brewery on Moss Lane West was built in 1861, established by the Graetorix Brothers and originally known as the Queen&#x27;s Brewery. It was sold to Hydes in 1898 and became known as Hydes Anvil Brewery. Beer was brewed at the site until 2012, when Hydes moved production to a new building in Salford. The brewery building itself is grade II listed and is awaiting redevelopment.

Established in 2010, the Moss Cider Project is a local community enterprise which takes donations of apples from trees in Moss Side and the surrounding area and makes them into cider and apple juice. Those who donate the apples get a share of what is produced.

===Other industry===

The northern England office of Aquatech Pressmain, which specialises in the &#x27;supply of fluid pumping equipment to the Building Services, Process and Water Industries&#x27;, is located in Moss Side.

Bridgewater Hospital, on Princess Road, is a private hospital that provides a range of healthcare treatments.

==Demography==

In 2007, the Moss Side ward was estimated to have a total population of 17,537, of which 8,785 were male and 8,752 were female. Moss Side is noted as an area with a greater population density and a faster population growth than other areas of the city of Manchester, with an increase of 17.4% between 2001 and 2007. The &quot;Moss Side ward profile: Version 2010/1&quot;, produced by Manchester City Council, points to a significant shift in the demography of Moss Side, in terms of age structure, from the middle of the last decade and projected into the middle of this decade, with more in the under 10 and 25–35 age groups, suggesting an increase in families with younger children. Other sources indicate an accompanying change in Moss Side&#x27;s ethnic population, with an estimated marked percentage increase in the Afro-Caribbean, Indian, Somali, Chinese and Eastern European communities between 2007 and 2015.

== Crime ==
Moss Side has a high crime rate. In April 1994, &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper highlighted Moss Side as one of the most deprived areas in Britain, and as having some of the highest crime rates. Drug abuse was described as one of the area&#x27;s biggest problems, with gun crime rates being so high that there had recently been 400 armed incidents reported within a 12-month period. Ambulance crews had resorted to wearing body armour after having to deal with a string of mostly drug-related shootings. Several doctors had been robbed of medical bags at knife point after being called out to local patients. A number of police vehicles had been fire-bombed and there had been reports of attempted ambushes on police patrols. Unemployment stood at nearly 30% – up to three times the national average in the early 1990s.

The following stabbings and shootings happened in the area:
* 2018 Moss Side mass shooting
* 2020 Moss Side shooting
* 2020 Moss Side stabbing

==Community==

Moss Side has longstanding Afro-Caribbean and South Asian populations. There has also been a recent increase in residents from other communities, including those from Somalia and Eastern Europe.

A number of local community and voluntary groups provide social support, as well as cultural and leisure opportunities to each of these communities. These organisations and institutions include The West Indian Sports and Social Club, the African and Caribbean Mental Health Service, and the African-Caribbean Care Group, which serve the Afro-Caribbean community. The Caribbean Carnival of Manchester is also held in the area every August, usually in Alexandra Park. The Indian Senior Citizens group provides support for the elderly within the Indian community. Additionally, the Somali Bravanese Sisters and the Polish School Manchester cater to the Somali and Polish communities, respectively.

The Reno was a late night club at the junction of Princess Road and Moss Lane East in Moss Side. The Reno and the Nile (upstairs from the Reno) were Manchester&#x27;s most famous drinking clubs for the city&#x27;s West Indian community and played a key role in the development of black culture in the city.

Moss Side is also home to a population with a keen interest in green politics and sustainable living, with initiatives such as the Moss Cider Project and Carbon Co-op. Moss Side Community Allotment states its aim as involving volunteers in growing and making available locally produced organic food. A local disused space, known as &#x27;The Triangle&#x27;, involved a community group in regenerating wasteground into a communal garden. Other groups, such as Bowes Street Residents Association have sought to &#x27;green&#x27; the area through the use of &#x27;alley gating&#x27; and planting in contained alleys. The &#x27;meanwhile garden&#x27; on the site of the former bus depot is currently being turned into an apple orchard. With the aim of changing perceptions of the area, a group of local residents acting as &#x27;community ambassadors&#x27; was also formed in January 2012.

The Millennium Powerhouse youth service caters for 8- to 25-year-olds and includes a music studio, fitness studio, dance studio, sports hall and offers information and advice to young people, including a library, along with recreational and sport groups. Windrush Millennium Centre, which provides adult education and other community facilities, is situated on Alexandra Road. Additionally, the area features a number of Polish and Indian restaurants and eateries. It has also in recent years seen the opening of several Somali cafes.

==Education==

In 2003, Ducie Central High School was replaced by the independently run Manchester Academy, with the aim of overcoming barriers to education and achievement faced by young people in the community. In April 2009, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported the Academy has met with success in raising educational standards in the area and, by 2010, 81% of pupils achieved A*–C grades at GCSE, compared with 13% at the former Ducie High School. In November 2009, it won the Academy Partnership Award, at the UK Education Business Awards, whilst, in July 2010, Academy pupils were named as national debating finalists at the Debate Mate competition at the House of Lords. In December 2010, it was reported that this &#x27;once failing school&#x27; was &#x27;now named as one of [the] UK&#x27;s best&#x27;.

The area has five primary schools: Claremont Primary School, Devine Mercy RC Primary School, Holy Name RC Primary School, St Mary&#x27;s CE Junior and Infant School and Webster Primary School. In July 2014, St Mary&#x27;s CE Junior and Infant School won the Times Educational Supplement national &quot;Primary School of the Year&quot; award.

The Windrush Millennium Centre on Alexandra Road provides facilities for courses of college and adult education, including some run by the City College Manchester and Manchester College of Arts and Technology. Manchester City Council runs the Greenheys Adult Learning Centre on Upper Lloyd Street.

There are nearest secondary schools, including St Peter&#x27;s RC High School.

==Religion==

The original St James&#x27;s Church (Church of England), Princess Road, was built in 1887–88 (architect John Lowe): of red brick in the Perpendicular revival style. This has now been replaced by a modern brick building which also contains offices used by local community groups.

Christ Church, Lloyd Street North, is an Anglican church of 1899–1904 by W. Cecil Hardisty and is a Grade II* listed building as of 24 April 1987.

Several evangelical churches congregate in Moss Side, including Revelation Church Manchester, which meets in the Moss Side Millennium Power House, Grace Church Manchester, which meets in the Manchester Academy building, Church of God of Prophecy on Raby Street and South Manchester Family Church, which meets at Manchester High School for Girls.

There are two Roman Catholic churches, the Church of Divine Mercy, a Polish church founded in 1961, which is on Moss Lane East; and the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour (founded 1949). The Polish church occupies a former Methodist chapel built about 1875 in the Neo-Gothic style and contains stained glass windows commemorating victims of the Holocaust. It is a few yards south of Christ Church.

The former Swedenborgian Church also dates from 1888 and is Neo-Gothic in style. It was built to replace the previous Swedenborgian church in Peter Street, Manchester. On an adjacent site was the Church of the New Age (founded 1923) and there was also in Raby Street the Wesleyan Methodist Church.
==Sports==
From 1923, Moss Side was the location of Manchester City F.C.&#x27;s stadium at Maine Road which on several occasions in its early years drew crowds of more than 80,000. However its capacity was gradually reduced over the years and by the mid-1990s it held just under 35,000 spectators all seated. Plans to rebuild the stadium to seat 45,000 were abandoned in favour of moving to the City of Manchester Stadium. Maine Road has since been demolished and a mixed development of two-, three-, and four-bedroom houses, flats, and a primary school has been built on the site.

<doc id="569809" wikidata="Q987305" url="?curid=569809" title="Frank Herbert's Dune">
<text>Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune is a 2000 science fiction television miniseries, based on the 1965 novel of the same title by Frank Herbert. It is written for the screen and directed by John Harrison, and stars Alec Newman as Paul Atreides, William Hurt as Duke Leto Atreides, and Saskia Reeves as Lady Jessica, along with Ian McNeice, Julie Cox, and Giancarlo Giannini. It was an international co-production between the American cable network Syfy, and companies in Germany, Canada, and Italy. This is the second overall filmed adaptation of Herbert’s novel, following the 1984 film directed by David Lynch, and preceding Denis Villeneuve’s two-part film adaptation (2021 and ). 

The series was first broadcast in three installments, beginning on December 3, 2000. It was released on DVD in 2001 by Artisan Entertainment, with an extended director&#x27;s cut appearing in 2002. It received generally positive reviews, and was praised by both critics and audiences for its faithfulness to Herbert’s novel. The series was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards and won two, for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited Series or Movie and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects.

A 2003 sequel miniseries titled &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot; continues the story, adapting the second and third novels in the series (1969&#x27;s &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and its 1976 sequel &quot;Children of Dune&quot;). Both miniseries are among the highest-rated programs ever to be broadcast on the Syfy Channel.

==Production==

=== Development ===
Acquiring the television rights to Frank Herbert&#x27;s original six &quot;Dune&quot; novels, executive producer Richard P. Rubinstein envisioned the complex material adapted in a miniseries format, as he had done previously with Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot; and &quot;The Langoliers&quot;. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2003, &quot;I have found there&#x27;s a wonderful marriage to be had between long, complicated books and the television miniseries. There are some books that just can&#x27;t be squeezed into a two-hour movie.&quot; Around the same time Rubenstein was first developing the material, the Sci Fi Channel&#x27;s president, Bonnie Hammer, was spearheading a campaign for the channel to produce &quot;blockbuster miniseries on a regular basis&quot;. The &quot;Dune&quot; miniseries was greenlit in November 1999. 

Released in 2000, &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; was the first of the Sci Fi Channel&#x27;s miniseries, followed by Steven Spielberg&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Taken&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; in 2003. Rubenstein called his two &quot;Dune&quot; miniseries &quot;science fiction for people who don&#x27;t ordinarily like science fiction&quot; and suggested that &quot;the &quot;Dune&quot; saga tends to appeal to women in part because it features powerful female characters&quot;.

=== Filming ===
Though the production initially scouted filming locations in Morocco, these proved unfeasible. &quot;Dune&quot; was shot entirely in the Czech Republic at Barrandov Studios in Prague, with post-production taking place at Cinecittà Studios in Rome, Italy. The miniseries was shot by Oscar-winning cinematographer Vittorio Storaro in his proprietary Univisium (2.00:1) aspect ratio, although it was broadcast in 1.78:1. The sets were designed by production designer Miljen Kljaković, and the costumes by Theodor Pištěk. 

=== Comparisons to source material ===
Director John Harrison has described his adaptation as a &quot;faithful interpretation&quot; in which any changes he made served to suggest what Herbert had explained subtly or not at all. The miniseries introduces elements not found in Herbert&#x27;s novel, but according to the director, these serve to elaborate rather than to edit. Hurt was the first to be cast in the 2000 adaptation. A fan of the novel, he told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I was a science fiction junkie ... [Harrison] captured Herbert&#x27;s prophetic reflection of our own age, where nation-states are competing with the new global economy and its corporate elements.&quot;

Herbert&#x27;s novel begins with lead character Paul Atreides being 15 years old and aging to 18 over the course of the story. Harrison aged the character to adulthood in order to draw upon an adult acting pool for this crucial role.

The miniseries invents an extensive subplot for Princess Irulan, a character who plays little part in the plot of the first novel. Harrison felt the need to expand Irulan&#x27;s role because she played such an important part in later books, and epigraphs from her later writings opened each chapter of &quot;Dune&quot;. Additionally, the character gave him a window into House Corrino. Besides the final scene, the only one of Irulan&#x27;s appearances based on an actual excerpt from the novel is her visit to Feyd-Rautha. However, in the book it is a different Bene Gesserit, Margot Fenring, who visits the Harkonnen heir, on assignment from the Bene Gesserit to &quot;preserve the bloodline&quot; by retrieving his genetic material (through conception) for their breeding program. The miniseries does not suggest this as Irulan&#x27;s motive.

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack album for the miniseries was released by GNP Crescendo Records on December 3, 2000. It contains 27 tracks composed by Graeme Revell and Tim Simonec and performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.

== Reception ==

=== Ratings ===
&quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; aired in three parts, starting Sunday, December 3, 2000. The first installment achieved a 4.6 rating with 3 million homes, and the miniseries averaged a 4.4/2.9 million households over all three nights. This doubled all viewership records for Sci Fi, placing &quot;Dune&quot; among the top ten of basic cable&#x27;s original miniseries in the five years previous. Two of the three installments also rated among the year&#x27;s top 10 original cable movies. As of 2007, the 2000 &quot;Dune&quot; miniseries and its 2003 sequel were two of the three highest-rated programs ever to be broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel.

=== Critical response ===
Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; deemed the miniseries a better adaptation than the 1984 Lynch film, but wrote that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t reach spectacular heights due to the desire to be as close to the written text as possible.&quot; She wrote that &quot;the story naturally drags at certain points in the book that work in prose but not on screen&quot;, and added that &quot;the narrative gets over-explained in an effort to be sure that no one watching is left behind.&quot; Asher-Perrin suggested that Harrison&#x27;s choice to cast adult actor Newman as Paul is problematic because the character is written in the script as less mature and observant than he is in the source novel, but she praised many members of the cast, in particular McNeice (Baron Harkonnen) and Cox (Irulan). Asher-Perrin also complimented the special effects, set design, and costuming.

The series was also praised by several critics, including Kim Newman.

===Awards and nominations===

== Alternate versions ==
A director&#x27;s cut special edition was released on DVD featuring expanded footage and dialogue.

==Video game==
The 2001 3D video game &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot; by Cryo Interactive/DreamCatcher Interactive is styled after the 2000 miniseries.

==Sequel series==
A 2003 sequel miniseries titled &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Children of Dune&quot; continues the story, adapting the second and third novels in the series (1969&#x27;s &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; and its 1976 sequel &quot;Children of Dune&quot;).

==Relation to other adaptations==
John Harrison and Richard P. Rubinstein are credited as executive producers of the &quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2024), the two-part theatrical film adaptations of the novel released by Warner Bros.

<text>The Dolomitenmann is an extreme sports relay race held in September in the East Tyrolean, or so-called Dolomite Mountains of Austria, near the city of Lienz. The founder and organiser is Werner Grissmann, a former World Cup skier.

The Dolomitenmann relay race has been run annually since 1988. In recent years the race has been sponsored by the manufacturers of Red Bull energy drink and is now known as &quot;Red Bull Dolomitenmann&quot;. The race is billed by its organizers as &quot;the world&#x27;s toughest team relay race&quot;.

The competition is only open to male athletes. Race organizer Werner Grissmann justifies this with the statement that he wishes to protect women, since the competition is only meant for the &quot;hardest athletes&quot;, he does not want &quot;to see women suffer&quot; and that it would be &quot;incompatible with their aesthetics&quot;. In 2017 for the first time there was a side competition that was also open to female athletes.

== Disciplines ==
* mountain running
* paragliding
* mountainbiking
* whitewater kayaking

== Course ==
The race is started by the &quot;mountain runner&quot; on the town square of Lienz at above sea level. who then runs a distance of around up to &quot;Kühbodentörl&quot; at .

When the runner makes the hand-off to the team&#x27;s &quot;paraglider&quot;, he must also run, this time with his whole equipment to the first take-off point. After descending by air to Moosalm, the paraglider runs to a second take-off point, descending to Leisach where the &quot;mountain biker&quot; is ready and waiting.

The &quot;mountain biker&quot; typically climbs or more, over a distance of about . After the climb, the mountain biker must ride a downhill track to the finish.

The teams &quot;kayaker&quot; swims across the river Drau where his boat is stationed. His first maneuver is an &quot;alpine-start&quot;, or a drop off a ramp into the river. After the jump the &quot;kayaker&quot; must navigate a difficult white water track on the river Isel before a last sprint back to the main square of Lienz.

== Winning teams and tracks ==
The fastest athlete of each discipline receives a trophy and the title &quot;Dolomitenmann&quot;. Until 2019 the trophies were designed by Jos Pirkner.

== Dolomitenmen ==
As of September 2020, there are 58 Dolomitenmen from 10 nations.

<doc id="569820" wikidata="Q901333" url="?curid=569820" title="Losing My Religion">
<text>&quot;Losing My Religion&quot; is a song by American alternative rock band R.E.M., released in February 1991 by Warner Bros. as the first single from their seventh album, &quot;Out of Time&quot; (1991). It developed from a mandolin riff improvised by the guitarist, Peter Buck, with lyrics about unrequited love.

&quot;Losing My Religion&quot; is R.E.M.&#x27;s highest-charting hit in the United States, reaching No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and expanding their popularity. Its music video, directed by Tarsem Singh, features religious imagery. 

At the 1992 Grammy Awards, &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; won Best Short Form Music Video and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Its video won awards for Video of the Year, Best Group Video, Breakthrough Video, Best Art Direction, Best Direction, and Best Editing at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2020, &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; became the first R.E.M. video to reach one billion views on YouTube. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; at No. 169 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Recording==
The R.E.M. guitarist, Peter Buck, wrote the main riff and chorus for &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; on a mandolin. He had recently bought it and was learning how to play, recording as he practiced while watching television. Buck said that &quot;when I listened back to it the next day, there was a bunch of stuff that was really just me learning how to play mandolin, and then there&#x27;s what became &#x27;Losing My Religion&#x27;, and then a whole bunch more of me learning to play the mandolin&quot;.

In July 1990, R.E.M. recorded a demo version with the working title &quot;Sugar Cane&quot; in a studio in Athens, Georgia, featuring banjo and Hammond organ. Mike Mills wrote a bassline inspired by the Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie, saying he could not compose a bassline that was not derivative. The final version was recorded in September at Bearsville Studio A in Woodstock, New York. 

Finding the song lacked midrange between the bass and mandolin, R.E.M. enlisted the touring guitarist Peter Holsapple on acoustic guitar. Buck said, &quot;It was really cool: Peter and I would be in our little booth, sweating away, and Bill and Mike would be out there in the other room going at it. It just had a really magical feel.&quot; Michael Stipe recorded his vocals in a single take. The strings, arranged by Mark Bingham, were performed by members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at Soundscape Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, in October 1990.
==Composition and lyrics==
&quot;Losing My Religion&quot; is based on Buck&#x27;s mandolin part. Buck said, &quot;The verses are the kinds of things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [of] like those &#x27;Driver 8&#x27; chords. You can&#x27;t really say anything bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G ... We are trying to get away from those kind of songs, but like I said before, those are some good chords.&quot; He felt &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; was the most &quot;typical&quot; R.E.M. song on the album. The song is in natural minor.

The title phrase is an expression from the Southern United States that means &quot;losing one&#x27;s temper or civility&quot; or &quot;feeling frustrated and desperate&quot;. Stipe said the song was about romantic expression and unrequited love. The lines &quot;That&#x27;s me in the corner / That&#x27;s me in the spotlight&quot; were originally &quot;That&#x27;s me in the corner / That&#x27;s me in the kitchen&quot;, describing a person at a social event too shy to approach the person they like. Stipe compared the theme to &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; (1983) by the Police, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s just a classic obsession pop song. I&#x27;ve always felt the best kinds of songs are the ones where anybody can listen to it, put themselves in it and say, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s me.&#x27;&quot;

==Music video==

The music video for &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; was directed by the Indian filmmaker Tarsem Singh. Unlike previous R.E.M. videos, Stipe agreed to lip-sync the lyrics. The video begins inside a dark room where water drips from an open window. Recreating a scene from the Andrei Tarkovsky film &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;, Buck, Berry, and Mills run across the room while Stipe remains seated as a pitcher of milk drops from the windowsill and shatters.

The video originated as a combination of ideas envisioned by Stipe and Singh. Stipe wanted a straightforward performance video, akin to Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;. Singh wanted to create a video in the style of a certain type of Indian filmmaking, where everything would be &quot;melodramatic and very dreamlike&quot;, according to Stipe. Singh said the video was modeled after the Gabriel García Márquez short story &quot;A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings&quot;, in which an angel crashes into a town and the villagers have varied reactions to him. He also drew inspiration from the Italian painter Caravaggio, and the video uses religious imagery such as Saint Sebastian, the Biblical episode of the Incredulity of Thomas, and Hindu deities, portrayed in a series of tableaux. The actor Wade Dominguez appears in the video.

The &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; video was nominated in nine categories at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards and won for Video of the Year, Best Group Video, Breakthrough Video, Best Art Direction, Best Direction, and Best Editing. It ranked second in the music video category of the 1991 Pazz &amp; Jop poll. In September 2020, &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; became the first R.E.M. video to reach one billion views on YouTube.

==Release and promotion==

&quot;Losing My Religion&quot; was released on February 19, 1991, in the United States as the lead single from R.E.M.&#x27;s album &quot;Out of Time&quot;. Their record label, Warner Bros., was wary of the choice of lead single. Steven Baker, then the vice president of product management., said there were &quot;long, drawn-out discussions&quot; about releasing such an &quot;unconventional track&quot; as the single until the label agreed.

R.E.M. did not tour to promote &quot;Out of Time&quot;, but visited radio stations, gave press interviews and made television appearances. On November 10, 1991, R.E.M. performed &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; with members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra to celebrate the tenth anniversary of MTV. It was recorded at the Madison Morgan Cultural Centre in Madison, Georgia, about 20 miles south of Athens. 

Warner Bros. worked to establish &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; at campus, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations before promoting it to American Top 40 stations, where it became a success. According to one program director, &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; was &quot;a hard record to program; you can&#x27;t play L.L. Cool J behind it. But it&#x27;s a real pop record—you can dance to it.&quot; He said it &quot;crosses the boundaries of just being an alternative record&quot;.

&quot;Losing My Religion&quot; became R.E.M.&#x27;s biggest hit in the US, reaching No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It stayed on the chart for 21 weeks. It topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart for three weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks chart for eight weeks, the best performance of any R.E.M. song on either chart. It reached number 19 on the UK singles chart, No. 16 in Canada and No. 11 in Australia.

With &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;, R.E.M. crossed over into mainstream pop culture. Asked if he was worried the success might alienate older fans, Buck told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The people that changed their minds because of &#x27;Losing My Religion&#x27; can just kiss my ass.&quot; Mills said R.E.M. understood they had a worldwide hit when they heard it on local radio in the jungle of Paraguay. Years later, Mills said: &quot;Without &#x27;Losing My Religion&#x27;, &quot;Out of Time&quot; would have sold two or three million [copies], instead of the ten [million copies] or so it did. But the phenomenon that is a worldwide hit is an odd thing to behold. Basically that record was a hit in almost every civilised country in the world.&quot; 

==Reception==
Caren Myers from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named the song &quot;Single of the Week&quot;, writing that it &quot;occupies a smaller, more intimate space, delicately picking a path with mandolins and acoustic guitars, soothed by the mournful sweep of a string section. Deceptive echoes of &#x27;World Leader Pretend&#x27; dissolve on second listen as the song wraps itself around the impossibility of communication with glancing but painful accuracy. Stipe&#x27;s writing is getting sparser and more intense, riddled with oblique insights but unwilling to point out where. This is R.E.M. at their most tender and unsettling, Stipe&#x27;s careworn voice filled with inexplicable sadness, but as warm and familiar as ever.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; wrote: &quot;Hearing such a beautiful song with a striking mandolin arrangement, provides an ample religious substitute.&quot; Terry Staunton from &quot;NME&quot; found that it &quot;is likely to be read as self-reflection on R.E.M.&#x27;s position in the worldwide musical scheme of things, doubt and discomfort at the prospect of unwanted disciples&quot;. 

Parry Gettelman from &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; wrote that R.E.M. had returned to its &quot;trademark jangle&quot;, and that &quot;Stipe touches again on what seems to be ambivalence about his role as a pop star, and about the need to communicate with an audience&quot;. David Fricke from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that &quot;there is melancholy in the air: in the doleful strings and teardrop mandolin&quot;. Celia Farber from &quot;Spin&quot; praised it as &quot;a gorgeous, gorgeous song&quot; and said &quot;I actually get a hot/cold flash and have to play the song about 30 more times&quot; when she hears the opening lyrics.

&quot;Losing My Religion&quot; placed second in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop annual critics&#x27; poll, behind Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. At the 1992 Grammy Awards, it earned several nominations, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year, and won for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best Short Form Music Video. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; at No. 169 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, writing that &quot;never before had Michael Stipe sounded so vulnerable, yearning, and articulate&quot;. In 2007, VH1 named it the ninth-best song of the 90s, and in 2009, &quot;Blender&quot; ranked it No. 79 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born&quot;. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it in its 2004 list of &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.

<doc id="569822" wikidata="Q1074236" url="?curid=569822" title="Infield fly rule">
<text>The infield fly rule is a rule of baseball and softball that treats certain fly balls as though caught, before the ball is caught, even if the infielder fails to catch it or drops it on purpose. The umpire&#x27;s declaration of an infield fly means that the batter is out (and all force plays are removed) regardless of whether the ball is caught. The rule exists solely to prevent the defense from executing a double play or triple play by deliberately failing to catch a ball that an infielder could catch with ordinary effort.

==Reasoning==
A ball batted into the air subjects baserunners to a dilemma. If the ball is caught, they must return to their original base; if it is not caught, the batter becomes a runner and existing runners are forced to advance to the next base if all bases between them and the (now running) batter are occupied. Baserunners study the fielder and advance only far enough from the base to ensure that they can return safely if the ball is caught. If a presumed catch becomes a non-catch, forced runners must run forward instead of back. This creates an advantage for the defense in intentionally failing to execute an easy catch, which the infield fly rule exists to remove. The officiating rationale that ultimately led to the rule began in the 1860s, due to the requirement to tag up on a base, and was formalized in 1874.

==Rule==
The infield fly rule is explained in the Official Baseball Rules in two places:
*Definitions of terms: Infield Fly
*Rule 5.09 (Batter is out)

The rule applies only when there are fewer than two outs, and there is a force play at third base (which means there are runners at first and second base, or the bases are loaded). The rule does not apply on line drives nor on bunt attempts. (See History, below.)

When the rule is in effect, if a fair fly ball is in play, and in the umpire&#x27;s judgment is catchable by an infielder with ordinary effort, the umpire shall call &quot;infield fly&quot; (or more often, &quot;infield fly, batter&#x27;s out&quot; or &quot;infield fly if fair&quot; when there is a chance of the ball drifting foul). The batter will be out regardless of whether the ball is actually caught. Umpires typically raise the right arm straight up, index finger pointing up and call to signal the rule is in effect.

If &quot;infield fly&quot; is called and the fly ball is caught, it is treated exactly as an ordinary caught fly ball; the batter is out, there is no force, and the runners must tag up. On the other hand, if &quot;infield fly&quot; is called and the ball lands fair without being caught, the batter is still out, there is still no force, but the runners &quot;are not&quot; required to tag up. In either case, the ball is live, and the runners may advance on the play, at their own risk.

An infield fly may be declared by any umpire on the field.

===&quot;Umpire&#x27;s judgment&quot;===
The infield fly rule is a judgment call, as the rule states that &quot;The judgment of the umpire must govern&quot;. The rule directs the umpire to declare an infield fly immediately on determining that the play meets the criteria described above, solely based on the umpire&#x27;s discretion. Since different umpires may have different definitions of what constitutes &quot;ordinary effort,&quot; the rule may be applied differently depending on the umpire and game conditions.

===&quot;Catchable by an infielder&quot;===
A fair fly ball that could be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort is covered by the rule, whether or not it is in the infield, and whether or not an infielder catches it, or even attempts to catch it. For example, if an infielder retreats to the outfield in an effort to catch a fly ball, the infield fly rule may be invoked because the ball could have been caught by the infielder. Similarly, infield fly may also be called if an outfielder runs into the infield to catch a fly ball, if it could have been caught by an infielder with ordinary effort. It may be helpful to think of it as the &quot;infielder fly rule&quot;. Specifically, the rule states an infield fly call should be determined by &quot;whether the ball could ordinarily have been handled by an infielder, not by some arbitrary limitation such as the grass, or the base lines. The umpire must rule also that a ball is an infield fly, even if handled by an outfielder, if, in the umpire&#x27;s judgment, the ball could have been as easily handled by an infielder.&quot;

===&quot;Ordinary effort&quot;===
The term &quot;ordinary effort&quot; considers all circumstances, including weather, lighting, positioning of the defense, and the abilities of the players involved in the play. A fly ball catchable with ordinary effort in Major League Baseball might not be in a junior high school game, due to the ability of the players involved.

===Foul balls===
If the fly ball is near the foul lines, the umpire is to declare &quot;infield fly, if fair&quot;. If the ball is not caught and ends up foul (including if it lands fair and then rolls foul before passing first or third base without being touched by a fielder), the infield fly call is canceled, and the play is treated as an ordinary foul ball. In contrast, if the ball lands foul and then rolls fair before passing first or third base without being touched, the infield fly takes effect and the batter is out.

===Statistics===
Declarations of the infield fly rule are not included in the statistical summary of a baseball game and are not a separate category in player statistics.

A fielder who misplays an infield fly is not charged with an error because the batter is out through the infield fly rule. In fact, the fielder who should have caught an infield fly earns a putout. But a fielder who fails to touch an infield fly that then rolls foul may be charged with an error for letting the ball roll foul; the batter is not out, and the misplay prolongs the batter&#x27;s time at bat.

==History==
The rule was introduced in 1895 by the National League in response to infielders intentionally dropping pop-ups to get multiple outs by forcing out the runners on base, who were pinned near their bases while the ball was in the air. At that time, the rule only applied with one man out.

The existing rule came into effect in 1901. It was amended in 1904 to exclude line drives, and in 1920 to also exclude bunt attempts.

===2008 World Series===
In the fifth game of the 2008 World Series between the Tampa Bay Rays and Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pedro Feliz of the Phillies hit a pop-up to the right side of the infield with runners on first and second and one out, in strong rain and swirling winds, and the infield fly rule was not invoked. Umpiring crew chief Tim Tschida explained that &quot;The infield fly rule requires the umpires&#x27; judgment to determine whether or not a ball can be caught with ordinary effort, and that includes wind&quot; and that the umpires&#x27; determination was that in this case there was no infielder who could make the play with &quot;ordinary effort&quot;. The ball was caught for the second out of the inning, and the runners did not stray far from their bases. 

===2012 National League Wild Card Game===
In the eighth inning of the 2012 National League Wild Card Game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Atlanta Braves, Andrelton Simmons of the Braves hit a pop-up into shallow left field with one out and men on first and second bases. Cardinals shortstop Pete Kozma, who was playing in normal position, ran out to left field to catch the ball while left fielder Matt Holliday, who was playing very deep in left, ran in to catch it as well. Although Kozma initially called to catch the ball, as the ball came down, he suddenly moved out of the way and the ball fell between him and Holliday. While it initially appeared that Simmons (the batter) had safely reached first base and the Braves had the bases loaded with one out, Simmons was called out because left field umpire Sam Holbrook had called &quot;infield fly&quot; just before the ball hit the ground, and the Braves now had runners at second and third with two outs, instead of bases loaded with one out. The Braves did not score in the inning, and the Cardinals went on to win the game, 6–3, eliminating the Braves from the postseason.

After the call, angry Braves fans began throwing plastic bottles and other debris onto the field, causing the game to be delayed for nearly 20 minutes. The Braves continued playing under an official protest from their manager, but shortly after the game, Joe Torre, MLB executive vice president for baseball operations, denied the protest, citing umpire&#x27;s judgment. Torre made the ruling immediately following the game (waiving the normal 24-hour review period) due to the importance of the game and the quick turnaround time before the next playoff game. The ball landed from home plate. Between 2009 and 2012, there were six infield-fly rulings on balls that weren&#x27;t caught, and the longest was measured at , less than the ball Simmons hit.

==Additional details==
===Umpires&#x27; signals===
As the infield fly rule is a special case, umpires signal one another at the start of an at-bat to remind one another that the game situation puts the rule into effect. A typical signal is to touch the brim of the cap so as to show the number of outs. Another signal often used by high school baseball umpires is to hold their right hand out flat and either tap or hold it over the shirt pocket on the left side of their chest.

===Second base unoccupied===
The infield fly rule is not in effect if there is no runner on second base. Provided the batter-runner runs to first base, the greatest benefit the defense could achieve by intentionally letting the fly ball drop untouched is to force out the runner at second rather than the batter, resulting in a runner on first base either way. However, if the batter is significantly slower than the runner, the defense may elect to let the ball drop untouched and achieve the force play, replacing the runner at first base with the batter.

Risks for the defense are that the uncaught ball may roll away from the fielder, and any runner on third base can try to score but has the option of remaining on his base.

If the batter-runner gives up on the play, the defense can achieve outs at second base and first base by deliberately letting the ball drop untouched.

===Intentional drop rule===
A related rule called the intentional drop rule applies even when second base is unoccupied (so long as first-base is occupied), and applies even when the batted ball is a line drive or a bunt that could be caught on the fly. This rule likewise prevents a fielder from deliberately dropping a ball and thereby achieving a double or triple play. If an umpire invokes this rule, the drop is ruled a catch, the ball is dead, and no baserunner may advance. The rule is not invoked when a fielder plays a ball on a bounce that might have been caught on the fly, or a fielder lets the ball fall to the ground without catching the palm of the mitt, or, in the judgment of the umpire, the ball was mishandled and not cleanly caught.

===Runner advancement===
For the runners, an infield fly is little different from an ordinary fly ball. If an infield fly is caught, the runners must retouch their original bases (&quot;tag up&quot;) after the catch before attempting to advance. If an infield fly is not caught, no tag up is required and the runners may advance at their own risk. The only difference is that the umpire&#x27;s declaration that the batter is out removes force plays and gives runners the option of staying on the base.

The infield fly rule states that runners may advance &quot;after the ball is touched&quot;. This rule governs the tag up if the infield fly is caught. The runner does not need to wait on base until the fielder achieves full control of the ball. There is no need to tag up at any time if the ball is dropped. There is no concept of tagging up under the intentional drop rule, as base advances are not allowed.

===Hit runners===
A runner hit by an infield fly while standing on a base is also protected from being declared out due to interference, unless this interference is deemed intentional (which appeared in the rules in 1940).

===Rule not declared===
The rulebook definition of Infield Fly says the umpire &quot;shall immediately declare &#x27;Infield Fly&#x27; for the benefit of the runners.&quot; However, sometimes they do not. As in the 2008 World Series game, there may be doubt as to whether the ball was catchable by an infielder with ordinary effort. If not called, the infield fly rule is not in effect. The same definition includes a comment that &quot;The infield fly is in no sense to be considered an appeal play.&quot; This suggests that the batter cannot be ruled out retroactively to settle a debate that occurs after the play ends. However, in Major League Baseball, the umpires are likely to correct their mistake if it leads to an unfair double or triple play.

==Batter passing another runner==
In adult baseball, a fly ball usually reaches the fielder before the batter can run the 90 feet to first base. However, in youth baseball, the distance between bases is shorter, and in some youth leagues, the infield fly rule is not in effect.

In this case, a baserunning gambit can be used to avoid a double or triple play. A fast batter may reach first base before the pop fly reaches the fielder. If the fielder fails to catch the ball, then the batter runs toward second base while the runner originally on first base remains there. Under Rule 7.08(h), the batter is out for passing a preceding runner, and under Rule 7.08(c), this out removes the force so that other runners are able to remain on their bases.

==Legal theory==
The infield fly rule was the subject of an article in a U.S. law journal. William S. Stevens was a law student in 1975 when he anonymously published &quot;The Common Law Origins of the Infield Fly Rule&quot; in the &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot;. The article was humorous but also insightful on how common law related to codified regulation of behavior. It has been cited in numerous legal decisions and in subsequent literature.

<text>St. John&#x27;s Northwestern Military Academy (SJNMA) was founded in 1884 as St. John&#x27;s Military Academy (SJMA) in Delafield, Wisconsin, by the Rev. Sidney T. Smythe as a private, college preparatory school. In 1995, Northwestern Military and Naval Academy (NMNA) in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, merged with St. John&#x27;s Military Academy to become St. John&#x27;s Northwestern Military Academy on the Delafield campus. In 2020, a Leadership Academy was added and the combined schools became St. John&#x27;s Northwestern Academies. SJNA (St. John&#x27;s Northwestern Academies) is a coed independent boarding and day school for boys and girls in grades 6–12. St. John&#x27;s Northwestern Summer Academy offers Little Lancers Day Camp, Summer Academy Plus, and ESL courses.

==Historic buildings==
St. John&#x27;s Northwestern campus consists of a collection of historic buildings, many with towers and battlements in a style that suggests a medieval castle, with most of them arranged in a U around the drill field.
* The school&#x27;s oldest surviving building is the 1857 rectory of St. John Chrysostom Church, a small Picturesque-style house which was repurposed in 1884 as the academy&#x27;s first dormitory, infirmary and dining hall.
* Next is the odd Shingle style Memorial Hall, designed by John A. Moller with its two caps and built in 1893 as a recreational building/gymnasium.
* Next among the surviving buildings is the Dr. Sidney Thomas Smythe house, designed by John A. Moller and built in 1901, an unusual agglomeration of Shingle style (the massing) and Classical Revival (the Doric columns) styles. Smythe, the founder of the school, lived here, calling the house &quot;Rosslyn.&quot;
* Knight Hall classroom building was added in 1902.

* Next was DeKoven Hall, designed in Collegiate Gothic style by Thomas Van Alyea and built in 1906, a four-story barracks/administration building with octagonal towers at the corners and battlements topping the walls.
* The dining hall and barracks Welles Hall was also added in 1906, designed by Van Alyea in a style similar to DeKoven Hall, but with a large square clock tower.
* The Beacon is a fieldstone monument built in 1923. It holds an eternal light and displays quotes from St. John&#x27;s founder.
* Victory Memorial Chapel was built from 1921 to 1926, modeled by Van Alyea on the chapel at West Point, and clad in lannonstone.
* In 1927 the school added the two-story Hazelwood Hall designed by Van Alyea, housing barracks and classrooms, and it was expanded with Scott Johnston Hall in 1930, with a corner turret.
* Smythe Hall was added in 1929, a classroom designed by Van Alyea in a &quot;castle&quot; style like the previous buildings.
In 1977 these historic campus buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places for the complementary design of many of them and since the school is the oldest military academy in Wisconsin.

<text>Flat chain is a form of chain used chiefly in agricultural machinery. Early machinery made extensive use of flat chain. It has been gradually replaced in most applications by roller chain, which is quieter, lasts longer, and requires less frequent retensioning.

Modern flat chain is made from stamped steel. Individual links can be put together or taken apart using simple tools, unlike roller chain which requires a master link or special splicing equipment.

Today, flat chain is used most often for conveyor belts, because it lends itself well to the attachment of slats, flights, buckets, and prongs used to move material. Such attachments can be welded on in the field, or can be purchased ready-made on a single link (or pair of links where the conveyor uses two chains) and then spliced into a loop of chain.

Older forms of flat chain were made of iron. Though the sprockets are compatible with modern chain, the two types cannot be spliced together.

<text>The Veneralia was an ancient Roman festival celebrated April 1 (the Kalends of &quot;Aprilis&quot;) in honor of Venus Verticordia (&quot;Venus the changer of hearts&quot;) and Fortuna Virilis (&quot;Manly&quot; or &quot;Virile Fortune&quot;).

The cult of Venus Verticordia was established in 220 BC, just before the beginning of the Second Punic War, in response to advice from a Sibylline oracle, when a series of prodigies was taken to signify divine displeasure at sexual offenses among Romans of every category and class, including several men and three Vestal Virgins. Her statue was dedicated by a young woman, chosen as the most &quot;pudica&quot; (sexually pure) in Rome by a committee of Roman matrons. At first, the statue was probably housed within the temple to Fortuna Virilis. This cult, older than that to Venus Verticordia but possibly perceived as weak or gone to seed, may have benefited from the moral and religious support of Venus as a relatively new but senior deity; for Ovid, Venus&#x27;s acceptance of the epithet and its responsibilities represented the goddess&#x27;s own change of heart. In 114 BC Venus Verticordia was given her own temple. She was meant to persuade Romans of both sexes and every class, whether married or unmarried, to cherish the traditional sexual proprieties and morality known to please the gods and benefit the State. During the Veneralia, her cult image was taken from her temple to the men&#x27;s baths, where it was undressed and washed in warm water by her female attendants, then garlanded with myrtle. At the Veneralia, women and men asked Venus Verticordia for her help in affairs of the heart, sex, betrothal and marriage. Fortuna Virilis was given cult on the same day.

<text>A mechanoreceptor, also called mechanoceptor, is a sensory receptor that responds to mechanical pressure or distortion. Mechanoreceptors are located on sensory neurons that convert mechanical pressure into electrical signals that, in animals, are sent to the central nervous system.

== Vertebrate mechanoreceptors ==

=== Cutaneous mechanoreceptors ===
Cutaneous mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stimuli that result from physical interaction, including pressure and vibration. They are located in the skin, like other cutaneous receptors. They are all innervated by Aβ fibers, except the mechanorecepting free nerve endings, which are innervated by Aδ fibers. Cutaneous mechanoreceptors can be categorized by what kind of sensation they perceive, by the rate of adaptation, and by morphology. Furthermore, each has a different receptive field.

==== By sensation ====
* The Slowly Adapting type 1 (SA1) mechanoreceptor, with the Merkel corpuscle end-organ (also known as Merkel discs) detect sustained pressure and underlies the perception of form and roughness on the skin. They have small receptive fields and produce sustained responses to static stimulation.
* The Slowly Adapting type 2 (SA2) mechanoreceptors, with the Ruffini corpuscle end-organ (also known as the bulbous corpuscles), detect tension deep in the skin and fascia and respond to skin stretch, but have not been closely linked to either proprioceptive or mechanoreceptive roles in perception. They also produce sustained responses to static stimulation, but have large receptive fields.
* The Rapidly Adapting (RA) or Meissner corpuscle end-organ mechanoreceptor (also known as the tactile corpuscles) underlies the perception of light touch such as flutter and slip on the skin. It adapts rapidly to changes in texture (vibrations around 50 Hz). They have small receptive fields and produce transient responses to the onset and offset of stimulation.
* The Pacinian corpuscle or Vater-Pacinian corpuscles or Lamellar corpuscles in the skin and fascia detect rapid vibrations of about 200–300 Hz. They also produce transient responses, but have large receptive fields.
* Free nerve endings detect touch, pressure, stretching, as well as the tickle and itch sensations. Itch sensations are caused by stimulation of free nerve ending from chemicals.
* Hair follicle receptors called hair root plexuses sense when a hair changes position. Indeed, the most sensitive mechanoreceptors in humans are the hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear (no relation to the follicular receptors – they are named for the hair-like mechanosensory stereocilia they possess); these receptors transduce sound for the brain.

==== By rate of adaptation ====
Cutaneous mechanoreceptors can also be separated into categories based on their rates of adaptation. When a mechanoreceptor receives a stimulus, it begins to fire impulses or action potentials at an elevated frequency (the stronger the stimulus, the higher the frequency). The cell, however, will soon &quot;adapt&quot; to a constant or static stimulus, and the pulses will subside to a normal rate. Receptors that adapt quickly (i.e., quickly return to a normal pulse rate) are referred to as &quot;phasic&quot;. Those receptors that are slow to return to their normal firing rate are called tonic. Phasic mechanoreceptors are useful in sensing such things as texture or vibrations, whereas tonic receptors are useful for temperature and proprioception among others.
* Slowly adapting: Slowly adapting mechanoreceptors include Merkel and Ruffini corpuscle end-organs, and some free nerve endings.
** Slowly adapting type I mechanoreceptors have multiple Merkel corpuscle end-organs.
** Slowly adapting type II mechanoreceptors have single Ruffini corpuscle end-organs.
* Intermediate adapting: Some free nerve endings are intermediate adapting.
* Rapidly adapting: Rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors include Meissner corpuscle end-organs, Pacinian corpuscle end-organs, hair follicle receptors and some free nerve endings.
** Rapidly adapting type I mechanoreceptors have multiple Meissner corpuscle end-organs.
** Rapidly adapting type II mechanoreceptors (usually called Pacinian) have single Pacinian corpuscle end-organs.

==== By receptive field ====
Cutaneous mechanoreceptors with small, accurate receptive fields are found in areas needing accurate taction (e.g. the fingertips). In the fingertips and lips, innervation density of slowly adapting type I and rapidly adapting type I mechanoreceptors are greatly increased. These two types of mechanoreceptors have small discrete receptive fields and are thought to underlie most low-threshold use of the fingers in assessing texture, surface slip, and flutter. Mechanoreceptors found in areas of the body with less tactile acuity tend to have larger receptive fields.

=== Lamellar corpuscles ===
Lamellar corpuscles, or Pacinian corpuscles or Vater-Pacini corpuscle, are deformation or pressure receptors located in the skin and also in various internal organs. Each is connected to a sensory neuron. Because of its relatively large size, a single lamellar corpuscle can be isolated and its properties studied. Mechanical pressure of varying strength and frequency can be applied to the corpuscle by stylus, and the resulting electrical activity detected by electrodes attached to the preparation.

Deforming the corpuscle creates a generator potential in the sensory neuron arising within it. This is a graded response: the greater the deformation, the greater the generator potential. If the generator potential reaches threshold, a volley of action potentials (nerve impulses) are triggered at the first node of Ranvier of the sensory neuron.

Once threshold is reached, the magnitude of the stimulus is encoded in the frequency of impulses generated in the neuron. So the more massive or rapid the deformation of a single corpuscle, the higher the frequency of nerve impulses generated in its neuron.

The optimal sensitivity of a lamellar corpuscle is 250 Hz, the frequency range generated upon finger tips by textures made of features smaller than 200 micrometres.

=== Ligamentous mechanoreceptors ===
There are four types of mechanoreceptors embedded in ligaments. As all these types of mechanoreceptors are myelinated, they can rapidly transmit sensory information regarding joint positions to the central nervous system.
* Type I: (small) Low threshold, slow adapting in both static and dynamic settings
* Type II: (medium) Low threshold, rapidly adapting in dynamic settings
* Type III: (large) High threshold, slowly adapting in dynamic settings
* Type IV: (very small) High threshold pain receptors that communicate injury
Type II and Type III mechanoreceptors in particular are believed to be linked to one&#x27;s sense of proprioception.

=== Other mechanoreceptors ===
Other mechanoreceptors than cutaneous ones include the hair cells, which are sensory receptors in the vestibular system of the inner ear, where they contribute to the auditory system and equilibrioception. Baroreceptors are a type of mechanoreceptor sensory neuron that is excited by stretch of the blood vessel. There are also juxtacapillary (J) receptors, which respond to events such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary emboli, pneumonia, and barotrauma.

=== Muscle spindles and the stretch reflex ===
The knee jerk is the popularly known stretch reflex (involuntary kick of the lower leg) induced by tapping the knee with a rubber-headed hammer. The hammer strikes a tendon that inserts an extensor muscle in the front of the thigh into the lower leg. Tapping the tendon stretches the thigh muscle, which activates stretch receptors within the muscle called muscle spindles. Each muscle spindle consists of sensory nerve endings wrapped around special muscle fibers called intrafusal muscle fibers. Stretching an intrafusal fiber initiates a volley of impulses in the sensory neuron (a I-a neuron) attached to it. The impulses travel along the sensory axon to the spinal cord where they form several kinds of synapses:

# Some of the branches of the I-a axons synapse directly with alpha motor neurons. These carry impulses back to the same muscle causing it to contract. The leg straightens.
# Some of the branches of the I-a axons synapse with inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord. These, in turn, synapse with motor neurons leading back to the antagonistic muscle, a flexor in the back of the thigh. By inhibiting the flexor, these interneurons aid contraction of the extensor.
# Still other branches of the I-a axons synapse with interneurons leading to brain centers, e.g., the cerebellum, that coordinate body movements.

=== Mechanism of sensation ===
In somatosensory transduction, the afferent neurons transmit messages through synapses in the dorsal column nuclei, where second-order neurons send the signal to the thalamus and synapse with third-order neurons in the ventrobasal complex. The third-order neurons then send the signal to the somatosensory cortex.

More recent work has expanded the role of the cutaneous mechanoreceptors for feedback in fine motor control. Single action potentials from Meissner&#x27;s corpuscle, Pacinian corpuscle and Ruffini ending afferents are directly linked to muscle activation, whereas Merkel cell-neurite complex activation does not trigger muscle activity.

== Invertebrate mechanoreceptors ==
Insect and arthropod mechanoreceptors include:
* Campaniform sensilla: Small domes in the exoskeleton that are distributed all along the insect&#x27;s body. These cells are thought to detect mechanical load as resistance to muscle contraction, similar to the mammalian Golgi tendon organs.
* Hair plates: Sensory neurons that innervate hairs that are found in the folds of insect joints. These hairs are deflected when one body segment moves relative to an adjoining segment, they have proprioceptive function, and are thought to act as limit detectors encoding the extreme ranges of motion for each joint.
* Chordotonal organs: Internal stretch receptors at the joints, can have both extero- and proprioceptive functions. The neurons in the chordotonal organ in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; can be organized into club, claw, and hook neurons. Club neurons are thought to encode vibrational signals while claw and hook neurons can be subdivided into extension and flexion populations that encode joint angle and movement respectively.
* Slit sensilla: Slits in the exoskeleton that detect physical deformation of the animal&#x27;s exoskeleton, have proprioceptive function.
* Bristle sensilla: Bristle neurons are mechanoreceptors that innervate hairs all along the body. Each neuron extends a dendritic process to innervate a single hair and projects its axon to the ventral nerve cord. These neurons are thought to mediate touch sensation by responding to physical deflections of the hair. In line with the fact that many insects exhibit different sized hairs, commonly referred to as macrochaetes (thicker longer hairs) and microchaetes (thinner shorter hairs), previous studies suggest that bristle neurons to these different hairs may have different firing properties such as resting membrane potential and firing threshold.

== Plant mechanoreceptors ==
Mechanoreceptors are also present in plant cells where they play an important role in normal growth, development and the sensing of their environment. Mechanoreceptors aid the Venus flytrap (&quot;Dionaea muscipula Ellis)&quot; in capturing large prey.

== Molecular biology ==
Mechanoreceptor proteins are ion channels whose ion flow is induced by touch. Early research showed that touch transduction in the nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; was found to require a two transmembrane, amiloride-sensitive ion channel protein related to epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). This protein, called MEC-4, forms a heteromeric Na+-selective channel together with MEC-10. Related genes in mammals are expressed in sensory neurons and were shown to be gated by low pH. The first of such receptor was ASIC1a, named so because it is an acid sensing ion channel (ASIC).

<text>Bajram Curri (), formerly known as Kolgecaj until 1952, is a town and administrative unit in the municipality of Tropojë, northeastern Albania, within the historical ethnographic region of the Gjakova Highlands. The town is located in a remote and mountainous region of the Albanian Alps, within the Valbonë Valley, and close to the border with Kosovo. It is named after Bajram Curri, a national hero who fought for ethnic Albanians, first against the Ottoman Empire and later against the Albanian government.

== History ==
Bajram Curri was founded in the year 1957 to serve as the center of the Tropoja district. The village was previously known as Kolgecaj. The newly formed city was built based on socialist principles. Historic Tropojë region was inhabited by the Berisha tribe and due to it geographic location had trading routes to the east (Kosovo vilayet) and to the west (Scutari vilayet) enabling the import of products from the Adriatic Sea region. One of the main trade goods was salt, which was exchanged for agricultural products. The center of Tropojë was an old city of Gjakova in the high mountains. The mountain pass &quot;Tropojë e Vjetër&quot; was used to relocate herds of cattle to graze in the green fields during summer and to return in autumn. People from all over the region went through this pass during the summer to enjoy fresh and cool air in high mountains. In modern times, these highlands also attract foreign tourists, especially from Europe and Israel.

== Geography ==
Bajram Curri is located down the valley of the river Valbonë. It is the main access point by road to the villages of Valbona and Rrogam. Water from the mountains flow into the waters of the Valbonë, the latter being famous for having the clearest river water in Albania. It is an administrative unit and the seat of the municipality of Tropojë.

=== Climate ===
Bajram Curri has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;).

Seeing silent lightning is very common in the summer nights of Bajram Curri.

== Economy ==

The municipality of Tropojë has many agricultural products and is famous for its chestnuts, apples, nuts, grapes, and especially blueberries.

Large reserves of platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, palladium, iridium, and osmium have been discovered in Tropojë. Albanian, Italian, and Chinese engineers, working for Albanian Minerals and Bytyci Sh.p.k in Tropojë, suggest the area may have more than 500 million tons of chrome ore and more than two billion tons of olivine.

== Demography ==
As of the 2023 census, the administrative unit of Bajram Curri had an estimated population of 4,113 of whom 2,026 were men and 2,087 women.

== Notable people ==

* Sheh Ali Nimani – founded the first school in Tropoja in village called Tpla
* Sali Berisha – President of Albania from 1992 to 1997 and its Prime Minister from 2005 to 2013
* Zhaneta Byberi – Miss Universe Albania 2014
* Azem Hajdari – anti-Communist activist
* Besnik Mustafaj – 62nd Minister of Foreign Affairs of Albania
* Gerhard Progni – footballer
* Fatime Sokoli – folk singer
* Fatmira Breçani – folk singer 
* Ibrahim Kadri Malaj – intellectual

<text>A thermoreceptor is a non-specialised sense receptor, or more accurately the receptive portion of a sensory neuron, that codes absolute and relative changes in temperature, primarily within the innocuous range. In the mammalian peripheral nervous system, warmth receptors are thought to be unmyelinated C-fibres (low conduction velocity), while those responding to cold have both C-fibers and thinly myelinated A delta fibers (faster conduction velocity). The adequate stimulus for a warm receptor is warming, which results in an increase in their action potential discharge rate. Cooling results in a decrease in warm receptor discharge rate. For cold receptors their firing rate increases during cooling and decreases during warming. Some cold receptors also respond with a brief action potential discharge to high temperatures, i.e. typically above 45 °C, and this is known as a paradoxical response to heat . The mechanism responsible for this behavior has not been determined.

==Location==
In humans, along the axons of Lissauer&#x27;s tract temperature or pressure sensations enter the spinal cord. The Lissauer&#x27;s tract will synapse on first-order neurons in grey matter of the dorsal horn, one or two vertebral levels up. The axons of these second-order neurons then decussate, joining the spinothalamic tract as they ascend to neurons in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus.

In mammals, temperature receptors innervate various tissues including the skin (as cutaneous receptors), cornea and urinary bladder. Neurons from the pre-optic and hypothalamic regions of the brain that respond to small changes in temperature have also been described, providing information on core temperature. The hypothalamus is involved in thermoregulation, the thermoreceptors allowing feed-forward responses to a predicted change in core body temperature in response to changing environmental conditions.

==Structure==
Thermoreceptors have been classically described as having free –non-specialized– endings. The mechanism of activation in response to temperature changes is not completely understood.

==Function==

Cold-sensitive thermoreceptors give rise to the sensations of cooling, cold and freshness.
In the cornea cold receptors are thought to respond with an increase in firing rate to cooling produced by evaporation of lacrimal fluid &#x27;tears&#x27; and thereby to elicit a blink reflex .
Other thermoreceptors will react to opposite triggers and give rise to heat and in some cases even burning sensations. This is often experienced when coming in contact with capsaicin, an active chemical commonly found in chili peppers. When coming in contact with your tongue (or any internal surface), the capsaicin de-polarizes the nerve fibers, allowing sodium and calcium into the fibers. In order for fibers to do so, they must have a specific thermoreceptor. The thermoreceptor reacting to capsaicin and other heat producing chemicals is known as TRPV1 . In response to heat, the TRPV1 receptor opens up passages that allow ions to pass through, causing the sensation of heat or burning.
TRPV1 also has a molecular cousin, TRPM8. Unlike TRPV1, TRPM8 produces cooling sensations as mentioned previously . Similar to TRPV1, TRPM8 responds to a certain chemical trigger by opening its ion pathways. In this case, the chemical trigger is often menthol or other cooling agents. Studies performed on mice determined that the presence of both these receptors allows for a gradient of temperature sensing. Mice lacking the TRPV1 receptor were still capable of determining areas significantly colder than on a heated platform. Mice lacking the TRPM8 receptor however, were not able to determine the difference between a warm platform and a cold platform, suggesting we rely on TRPM8 to determine cold feelings and sensations.

==Distribution==
Warm and cold receptors play a part in sensing innocuous environmental temperature. Temperatures likely to damage an organism are sensed by sub-categories of nociceptors that may respond to noxious cold, noxious heat or more than one noxious stimulus modality (i.e., they are polymodal) . The nerve endings of sensory neurons that respond preferentially to cooling are found in moderate density in the skin but also occur in relatively high spatial density in the cornea, tongue, bladder, and facial skin . The speculation is that lingual cold receptors deliver information that modulates the sense of taste; i.e. some foods taste good when cold, while others do not.

==Mechanism of transduction==
This area of research has recently received considerable attention with the identification and cloning of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family of proteins. The transduction of temperature in cold receptors is mediated in part by the TRPM8 channel . This channel passes a mixed inward cationic (predominantly carried by Na+ ions although the channel is also permeable to Ca2+) current of a magnitude that is inversely proportional to temperature . The channel is sensitive over a temperature range spanning about 10-35 °C . TRPM8 can also be activated by the binding of an extracellular ligand. Menthol can activate the TRPM8 channel in this way. Since the TRPM8 is expressed in neurons whose physiological role is to signal cooling, menthol applied to various bodily surfaces evokes a sensation of cooling . The feeling of freshness associated with the activation of cold receptors by menthol, particularly those in facial areas with axons in the trigeminal (V) nerve, accounts for its use in numerous toiletries including toothpaste, shaving lotions, facial creams and the like.

Another molecular component of cold transduction is the temperature dependence of so-called leak channels which pass an outward current carried by potassium ions. Some leak channels derive from the family of two-pore (2P) domain potassium channels . Amongst the various members of the 2P-domain channels, some close quite promptly at temperatures less than about 28 °C (e.g. KCNK4(TRAAK), TREK) . Temperature also modulates the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase . The Na+/K+-ATPase is a P-type pump that extrudes 3Na+ ions in exchange for 2K+ ions for each hydrolytic cleavage of ATP. This results in a net movement of positive charge out of the cell, i.e. a hyperpolarizing current. The magnitude of this current is proportional to the rate of pump activity.

It has been suggested that it is the constellation of various thermally sensitive proteins together in a neuron that gives rise to a cold receptor. This emergent property of the neuron is thought to comprise, the expression of the aforementioned proteins as well as various voltage-sensitive channels including the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel and the rapidly activating and inactivating transient potassium channel (IKA).

<text>Co-sleeping or bed sharing is a practice in which babies and young children sleep close to one or both parents, as opposed to in a separate room. Co-sleeping individuals sleep in sensory proximity to one another, where the individual senses the presence of others. This sensory proximity can either be triggered by touch, smell, taste, or noise. Therefore, the individuals can be a few centimeters away or on the other side of the room and still have an effect on the other. It is standard practice in many parts of the world, and is practiced by a significant minority in countries where cribs are also used.

Bed-sharing, a practice in which babies and young children sleep in the same bed with one or both parents, is a subset of co-sleeping. Co-bedding refers to infants (typically twins or higher-order multiples) sharing the same bed.

Whether cosleeping or using another sleep surface, it is considered important for the baby to be in the same room as an adult, committed caregiver for all sleeps — day and night — in early life. This is known to reduce the risk of SIDS by 50 per cent. Some organizations such as Red Nose Australia recommend this for the first 12 months of life and others such as the NHS recommend it for the first 6 months.

==Introduction==

Bed-sharing among married couples is standard practice in many parts of the world outside of North America, Europe and Australia, and even in the latter areas a significant minority of children have shared a bed with their parents at some point in childhood. One 2006 study of children age 3–10 in India reported 93% of children bed-sharing while a 2006 study of children in Kentucky in the United States reported 15% of infants and toddlers 2 weeks to 2 years engage in bed-sharing.

Bed-sharing was widely practiced in all areas up to the 19th century, until the advent of giving the child his or her own room and the crib. In many parts of the world, bed-sharing simply has the practical benefit of keeping the child warm at night. Bed-sharing has been relatively recently re-introduced into Western culture by practitioners of attachment parenting. Proponents hold that bed-sharing saves babies&#x27; lives (especially in conjunction with nursing), promotes bonding, enables the parents to get more sleep and facilitates breastfeeding. Older babies can breastfeed during the night without waking their mother. Opponents argue that co-sleeping is stressful for the child when they are not co-sleeping. They also cite concerns that a parent may smother the child or promote an unhealthy dependence of the child on the parent(s).

Because children become accustomed to behaviors learned in early experiences, bed-sharing in infancy will also increase the likelihood of these children to crawl into their parent&#x27;s bed in ages past infancy.

==Health and safety==
Health care professionals disagree about bed-sharing techniques, effectiveness, and ethics. However, safe cosleeping and bedsharing guidelines can be found on Lullaby Trust, where as organisations such as UNICEF outline the primary factors leading to hazardous cosleeping.

Traditional and cultural bedsharing and caregiving practices have also been found to reduce risk of SIDS for certain populations. But this is found to be opposite in others, increasing deaths categorised within SUDI.

===Known risks===
There are certain dangerous behaviors that increase SIDS and should be avoided whether placing a baby in a crib or co-sleeping: infants should always sleep on their backs on a firm surface (not waterbeds, pillows, recliners, or couches), mattresses should intersect the bedframe tightly, there should be no stuffed animals or soft toys near the baby, blankets should be light, a baby&#x27;s head should never be covered, and other SIDS risk factors should be avoided. In addition some parents pose threats to infants due to their behaviors and conditions, such as smoking or drinking heavily, taking drugs, a history of skin infections, obesity, or any other specific risk-increasing traits.

Co-sleeping also increases the risks of suffocation and strangulation. The soft quality of the mattresses, comforters, and pillows may suffocate the infants. Some experts, then, recommend that the bed should be firm, and should not be a waterbed or couch; and that heavy quilts, comforters, and pillows should not be used. Another common advice given to prevent suffocation is to keep a baby on its back, not its stomach. Parents who roll over during their sleep could inadvertently crush and/or suffocate their child, especially if they are heavy sleepers, over-tired or over-exhausted and/or obese. There is also the risk of the baby falling to a hard floor, or getting wedged between the bed and the wall or headboard. A proposed solution to these problems is the bedside bassinet, in which, rather than bed-sharing, the baby&#x27;s bed is placed next to the parent&#x27;s bed.

Another precaution recommended by experts is that young children should never sleep next to babies under nine months of age.

A 2008 report explored the relationship between ad hoc parental behaviors similar to traditional co-sleeping methodology, though the study&#x27;s subjects typically utilized cribs and other paraphernalia counter to co-sleeping models. While babies who had been exposed to behaviors reminiscent of co-sleeping had significant problems with sleep later in life, the study concluded that the parental behaviors were a reaction to already-present sleep difficulties. Most relationships between parental behavior and sleeping trouble were not statistically significant when controlled for those preexisting conditions. Further, typical co-sleeping parental behavior, like maternal presence at onset of sleep, were found to be protective factors against sleep problems.

===Association with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)===
Co-sleeping can often be regarded as an unnecessary practice that can be associated with issues such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However, research shows that opinions vary in the association between SIDS and co-sleeping. The most controversial issue regarding SIDS is whether bed sharing is a main cause, and whether it should be avoided or encouraged.

Some research indicates that SIDS risk increases with co-sleeping, particularly bed-sharing; other research indicates that co-sleeping done in an &quot;appropriate and safe&quot; manner reduces SIDS risk. As an example of the latter, the Pacific Islands Families study, conducted in New Zealand, indicated that the adoption of safe bed-sharing and room-sharing practices were saving infant lives, and found no examples of an infant dying from SIDS.

===Arguments in favor===
One study reported mothers getting more sleep and breast-feeding by co-sleeping than other arrangements. Parents also experience less exhaustion with such ease in feeding and comforting their child by simply reaching over to the child. As a result, co-sleeping also increases the responsiveness of parents to their child&#x27;s needs.

It has been argued that co-sleeping evolved over five million years, that it alters the infant&#x27;s sleep experience and the number of maternal inspections of the infant, and that it provides a beginning point for considering possibly unconventional ways of helping reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Stress hormones are lower in mothers and babies who co-sleep, specifically the balance of the stress hormone cortisol, the control of which is essential for a baby&#x27;s healthy growth. In studies with animals, infants who stayed close to their mothers had higher levels of growth hormones and enzymes necessary for brain and heart growth. Also, the physiology of co-sleeping babies is more stable, including more stable temperatures, more regular heart rhythms, and fewer long pauses in breathing than babies who sleep alone.

Besides physical developmental advantages, co-sleeping may also promote long-term emotional health. In long-term follow-up studies of infants who slept with their parents and those who slept alone, the children who co-slept were happier, less anxious, had higher self-esteem, were less likely to be afraid of sleep, had fewer behavioral problems, tended to be more comfortable with intimacy, and were generally more independent as adults.

===Products for infants===
There are several products that claim they can be used to facilitate safe co-sleeping with an infant however these claims are not evidence based:
* special-purpose bedside bassinets, sidecar sleepers and bedside sleepers, which attach directly to the side of an adult bed and are open to the parent&#x27;s side, but have barriers on the other three sides.
* bed top co-sleeping products designed to prevent the baby from rolling off the adult bed and to absorb breastmilk and other nighttime leaks.
* side rails to prevent the child from rolling off the adult bed.
* co-sleeping infant enclosures which are placed directly in the adult bed.
* specially designed separate sleeping bags for parents and infants which prevent covers being inadvertently pulled over the baby&#x27;s head.
* wahakura : A simple woven basket that allows babies to safely sleep in the same bed as parents.

==Prevalence==
A study of a small population in Northeast England showed a variety of nighttime parenting strategies and that 65% of the sample had bed-shared, 95% of them having done so with both parents. The study reported that some of the parents found bedsharing effective, yet were covert in their practices, fearing disapproval of health professionals and relatives. A National Center for Health Statistics survey from 1991 to 1999 found that 25% of American families always, or almost always, slept with their baby in bed, 42% slept with their baby sometimes, and 32% never bed-shared with their baby.

==Factors==
===Socioeconomic factors===
Initial assumptions on co-sleeping may place it in a context of income and socioeconomic status. Generally, families of low socioeconomic status will be unable to afford a separate room for a child while those of high socioeconomic status can more easily afford a home with a sufficient number of rooms. However, statistical data shows the prevalence of co-sleeping in wealthy Japanese families and the ability of poor Western families to still find a separate space for their child, suggests that the acceptance of co-sleeping is a result of culture.

===Cultural factors===
Several studies show that the prevalence of co-sleeping is a result of cultural preference. In a study of 19 nations, a trend emerged, depicting a widely accepted practice of co-sleeping in Asian, African, and Latin American countries, while European and North American countries rarely practiced it. This trend resulted mostly from the respective fears of parents: Asian, African, and Latin American parents worried about the separation between the parents and the child, while European and North American parents feared a lack of privacy for both the parents and the child.

<text>A studio apartment, or studio [[Condominium|condo]] also known as a studio flat (UK), self-contained apartment (Nigeria), efficiency apartment, bed-sitter (Kenya), or bachelor apartment, is a small dwelling in which the normal functions of a number of rooms – often the living room, bedroom, and kitchen – are combined into a single room.

Some studio apartments still include a private washroom, which may or may not include a bath or shower. Otherwise, washrooms and bathing facilities are often part of a common area accessible by the residents of multiple units, with various arrangements to ensure privacy. Some studio apartments also offer extra storage space which may or may not be attached to the main unit.

For their occupants, studio apartments offer the advantage of being considerably cheaper to rent or buy compared to multi-room dwellings, the resident only having to give up living space as opposed to the level of privacy that is the case when living as a roommate. Studio apartments have historically been offered mainly for rent, however in recent years the units have been increasingly sold as condominiums in response to rising housing costs making larger dwellings unaffordable to many would-be home buyers.

== Design ==

The studio apartment is an apartment with a single room. They are also known as single-room dwelling places or studio flats. A studio apartment typically consists of one large room that serves as the combined living, dining, and bedroom. A variation, sometimes called an &quot;alcove studio&quot;, may have a very small separate area; this wing or nook is off the main area, and can be used for dining or sleeping. The apartment&#x27;s kitchen facilities may be located either in the central room or in a small separate area. The bathroom is usually in its own smaller room, while the toilet can be separated.

Studio apartment sizes vary considerably by country.

A studio apartment differs from a bedsitter in the United Kingdom or single room occupancy (SRO) unit in the United States, in that an SRO does not usually contain a kitchen or bathroom. Bathroom facilities are shared with multiple units on the hall.

== Global variations ==
; Argentina: In Argentina, a studio apartment is called &quot;monoambiente&quot; (in Spanish, &quot;mono-&quot; is a prefix for one, and &quot;ambiente&quot; means room).
;Australia
: In Australia, a studio apartment is usually between 20 and 40 square meters. Features can vary. Studios will have a lounge area, and some will also have kitchenette, and a study nook. The main difference to other types of Australian apartments is, in a studio, instead of being in separate rooms, the living spaces are in the same room as the sleeping arrangements.

; Austria: In Austria, a studio apartment is traditionally called Garçonnière (derived from French &quot;garçon&quot;, meaning boy, young man, or bachelor) (commonly spelled Garconniere); the term &quot;Einzimmerwohnung&quot; (literally one-room apartment) is also widely used. Garconnieres are usually between 20 and 40 square meters (215 – 430 ft2), and consist of a combined bathroom and toilet, the main room with a kitchenette, and a small antechamber (&quot;Vorzimmer&quot;) connecting the two and leading to the corridor and stairwell outside the apartment. Garconnieres in large tenements were the typical homes of workers, and often their families, during and after the &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; (&quot;founders&#x27; period&quot;), the time of industrialization in the 19th century in Austria in Germany. Many pre-WWII Garconnieres even today don&#x27;t provide bathroom facilities of their own but facilities that are shared by all residents on the floor, whereas more modern Garconnieres are fully equipped.
; Brazil: In Brazil, a studio apartment is called &quot;quitinete&quot; (from kitchenette) or &quot;quarto-e-sala&quot; (literally, bedroom and [living] room). It is basically composed of one room, one bathroom, and a kitchen, which is often in the same space as the room. Lately, newly built quitinetes are starting to be called &quot;studios&quot;, for the modern appeal English as a foreign language has.

; Canada: In Canada, a bachelor apartment, or simply &quot;bachelor,&quot; is the common term in Canadian English for any single room dwelling unit which is not a shared accommodation. A shared room, or particularly small bachelor, is sometimes referred to as a &quot;bachelorette.&quot; Residents of the province of Quebec (most in French) widely use the term &quot;studio&quot; or &quot;one and a half&quot;.
; Czech Republic: In the Czech Republic, garsoniéra, often referred to as garsonka, (from French &quot;garçon&quot;, meaning boy, young man, bachelor) is a one-room apartment with separate bathroom and WC, abbreviated as 1+0, sometimes it is 1 room with separate bathroom and WC and kitchenette, abbreviated 1+KK.
;Denmark: In Denmark, they refer to a studio apartment as a &quot;one room apartment&quot; (1 &quot;værelses lejlighed&quot;). A studio apartment is not to be confused with a study apartment in Danish, which is accommodations that you are only allowed to rent if you are a student. These are often very cheap but in a rather good condition, close to a higher education facility and very small. Rarely larger than 40 square meters.
; Finland: In Finland, a studio apartment is called &quot;yksiö&quot; (from the word &quot;yksi&quot; meaning &quot;one&quot;), and are advertised as one-room apartments (a one-bedroom apartment is referred to as &quot;two rooms&quot;). The building of such apartments is a growing trend throughout Finland; 55% of new homes in the city of Turku are studio apartments with total areas of under 37 square metres. Between 1970 and 2020, the percentage of one-person households in Finland has almost tripled, from 15.7% to 45.3%.

; Germany: In Germany, studio apartments are called Einzimmerwohnungen (&quot;Ein&quot; means one, &quot;Zimmer&quot; means room, and &quot;Wohnung&quot; means apartment).
; Greece: In Greece, studio apartments were traditionally called γκαρσονιέρα (from the French &quot;garçonnière&quot;), alternatively the usage of the loanword στούντιο (studio) can be attested as well. Whilst there&#x27;s no clear difference at the etymological level (in dictionary entries) some distinguish the term γκαρσονιέρα as an apartment with a separate bedroom.
; Hong Kong: In Hong Kong, studio apartment is a mini apartment around in addition of bathroom and kitchen can cost up to US$20 thousand. The living area could be just around the size of a parking space.
; India: In India, studio apartments in general are called one room kitchen (1RK) apartment featuring a hallway with a bedroom with a bathroom and attached kitchenette to the hall mostly used by one or two people or a small family ranging from .
; Italy: In Italy, Italians call them &quot;monolocale&quot;, meaning &quot;one room&quot;. There is only one room with a kitchenette, and a separate bathroom.
; Jamaica: In Jamaica, studio apartments are commonly referred to as &quot;quads&quot;, and are a common feature in Eastern Kingston. They generally consist of one main room, acting as the living room, dining room and bedroom. The kitchen exists within the same room, with partitioning wall. The bathroom is in a smaller room, by itself. These studio apartments generally come with adequate yard space and washing facilities (on the outdoors). They have a bed, a stove and a TV too.
; Japan: Japan has an even smaller variation of the studio apartment known as the one room mansion.
; Kenya: In Kenya, they are commonly known as a bed-sitter. Rent varies from KSh.5,000 – 10,000/=, the equivalent of US$48.61 – 97.22. They are common places for young people to live when they start working.
; New Zealand: In New Zealand, studio apartments are known as studio rooms, and they frequently feature a bedroom with study area and an en-suite bathroom. Spaces such as kitchen, lounge and dining area are communal between other people staying in that apartment.
; Nigeria: In Nigeria, Studio apartments are known as &quot;room self-contain apartments&quot;. These apartments typically have a single room, which serves as the living room and bedroom, a kitchen, a bathroom and a toilet (which is often merged with the bathroom). This form of housing is quite different from Face to Face housing, which are normally built facing each other, and with shared toilet(s), bathroom(s) and kitchen space.
; North Macedonia: In North Macedonia, garsonjera (Гарсоњера) derived from the French &quot;garçonnière&quot;. Normally a one-room plus separate bathroom, sometimes with a very small, separate kitchen.
; Norway: In Norway, studio apartments in are called &quot;1-romsleilighet&quot;, &quot;one-room-apartment&quot; in English, because they count both the living room and the bedrooms. Hence an apartment with one bedroom is called a &quot;two-room-apartment&quot; (2-romsleilighet).
; Portugal: In Portugal, studio apartments are designated T0 (T-Zero). This designation follows the Portuguese house classification system, where apartments are classified by their typology as Tx, with the &quot;x&quot; representing the number of independent bedrooms. In the case of the T0, the &quot;0&quot; means that the apartment has no independent bedrooms.
; Poland: In Poland, studio apartments are called &quot;kawalerka&quot; (from the word &quot;kawaler&quot; – a bachelor).
; Romania: In Romania, studio apartment is known as &quot;garsonieră&quot;, a word derived from the French &quot;garçonnière&quot;. They are usually one room plus a separate bathroom, often with a small, separate kitchen.
; Russia: In the building codes and regulations and standards of the Russian Federation, the concept of &quot;studio apartment&quot; is not defined, therefore it is not possible to give an exact definition of this concept. In colloquial Russian, there is a word &quot;studiya&quot;, which means apartments with a combined bedroom and kitchen area. Russian studio apartments are represented in different segments of real estate. In economy class, these are flats of small square footage. But studio apartments also exist on a large area, and even in elite flats. In the secondary housing market, there are studios obtained by redevelopment of apartments such as Khrushchyovka and Brezhnevkas, in which the partitions between the living room and the small kitchen and hallway are removed.
; Singapore: In Singapore, studio apartments, in the context of Singapore&#x27;s public housing, are flats that are specifically built by the Housing and Development Board to cater to the growing senior citizen population. One must be at least 55 years old to purchase these studio apartments. Since August 2015, the scheme was replaced by 2-room Flexi flats, which gives seniors the flexibility to select a lease period that suits them best.
; Slovakia:In Slovakia, studio apartments are called garsoniéra, often referred to as garzónka or sometimes garzónka, a word from French &quot;garçon&quot;, meaning boy. This type of studio apartment is usually a one-room apartment where living room and kitchenette is combined into one room. Bathroom and toilet are usually separated. If the kitchen is separated by a wall or doors, it&#x27;s called 1+1. Studio apartments in Slovakia can usually be found in Slovak housing estates (sídlisko), but they might also be in other places.
; South Korea: In South Korea, studio apartments are called officetels or one rooms.
; Sweden: In Sweden, studio apartments are called an &quot;etta&quot;, &quot;a one&quot;. Usually between 20 and 40 m2

;Turkey
: In Turkey, studio apartments are called an &quot;stüdyo daıre&quot;. Usually between 30 and 50 m2.

; United Kingdom: In the United Kingdom (British), a studio flat is usually a single room with cooking facilities which has its own bathroom attached. Traditionally, if a dwelling has a shared bathroom, it is known as a bedsit. This distinction is encountered less frequently, as are bedsits themselves (especially in large cities) due to the consequences of the Housing Act 1989 discouraging landlords from offering this once widespread type of accommodation.
; United States: In the United States, the average size is 500 to 600 sq ft (46–56 square meters). In general in the US, the term &quot;studio apartment&quot; denotes a slightly larger apartment, typically with a separate kitchen, dining area, bathroom, and often an alcove and/or walk-in closet(s), whereas &quot;efficiency apartment&quot; indicates a one-room apartment with a kitchenette built into one of the walls, but typically still with a private bathroom (as opposed to one shared with other tenants, which would be an SRO). A variation common in New York City is the &quot;L-shaped&quot; or &quot;alcove&quot; studio, in which the central room branches off into a small alcove that can be used for sleeping or dining.

<text>Roller chain or bush roller chain is the type of chain drive most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on many kinds of domestic, industrial and agricultural machinery, including conveyors, wire- and tube-drawing machines, printing presses, cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. It consists of a series of short cylindrical rollers held together by side links. It is driven by a toothed wheel called a sprocket. It is a simple, reliable, and efficient means of power transmission.

Sketches by Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th century show a chain with a roller bearing. In 1800, James Fussell patented a roller chain on development of his balance lock and in 1880 Hans Renold patented a bush roller chain. 

==Construction==
There are two types of links alternating in the bush roller chain. The first type is inner links, having two inner plates held together by two sleeves or bushings upon which rotate two rollers. Inner links alternate with the second type, the outer links, consisting of two outer plates held together by pins passing through the bushings of the inner links. The &quot;bushingless&quot; roller chain is similar in operation though not in construction; instead of separate bushings or sleeves holding the inner plates together, the plate has a tube stamped into it protruding from the hole which serves the same purpose. This has the advantage of removing one step in assembly of the chain.

The roller chain design reduces friction compared to simpler designs, resulting in higher efficiency and less wear. The original power transmission chain varieties lacked rollers and bushings, with both the inner and outer plates held by pins which directly contacted the sprocket teeth; however this configuration exhibited extremely rapid wear of both the sprocket teeth and the plates where they pivoted on the pins. This problem was partially solved by the development of bushed chains, with the pins holding the outer plates passing through bushings or sleeves connecting the inner plates. This distributed the wear over a greater area; however the teeth of the sprockets still wore more rapidly than is desirable, from the sliding friction against the bushings. The addition of rollers surrounding the bushing sleeves of the chain and provided rolling contact with the teeth of the sprockets resulting in excellent resistance to wear of both sprockets and chain as well. There is even very low friction, as long as the chain is sufficiently lubricated. Continuous, clean, lubrication of roller chains is of primary importance for efficient operation, as is correct tensioning.

==Lubrication==
Many driving chains (for example, in factory equipment, or driving a camshaft inside an internal combustion engine) operate in clean environments, and thus the wearing surfaces (that is, the pins and bushings) are safe from precipitation and airborne grit, many even in a sealed environment such as an oil bath. Some roller chains are designed to have o-rings built into the space between the outside link plate and the inside roller link plates. Chain manufacturers began to include this feature in 1971 after the application was invented by Joseph Montano while working for Whitney Chain of Hartford, Connecticut. O-rings were included as a way to improve lubrication to the links of power transmission chains, a service that is vitally important to extending their working life. These rubber fixtures form a barrier that holds factory applied lubricating grease inside the pin and bushing wear areas. Further, the rubber o-rings prevent dirt and other contaminants from entering inside the chain linkages, where such particles would otherwise cause significant wear. 

There are also many chains that have to operate in dirty conditions, and for size or operational reasons cannot be sealed. Examples include chains on farm equipment, bicycles, and chain saws. These chains will necessarily have relatively high rates of wear.

Many oil-based lubricants attract dirt and other particles, eventually forming an abrasive paste that will compound wear on chains. This problem can be reduced by use of a &quot;dry&quot; PTFE spray, which forms a solid film after application and repels both particles and moisture.

===Motorcycle chain lubrication===
Chains operating at high speeds comparable to those on motorcycles should be used in conjunction with an oil bath. For modern motorcycles this is not possible, and most motorcycle chains run unprotected. Thus, motorcycle chains tend to wear very quickly relative to other applications. They are subject to extreme forces and are exposed to rain, dirt, sand and road salt.

Motorcycle chains are part of the drive train to transmit the motor power to the back wheel. Properly lubricated chains can reach an efficiency of 98% or greater in the transmission. Unlubricated chains will significantly decrease performance and increase chain and sprocket wear.

Two types of aftermarket lubricants are available for motorcycle chains: spray on lubricants and oil drip feed systems.
*Spray lubricants may contain wax or PTFE. While these lubricants use tack additives to stay on the chain they can also attract dirt and sand from the road and over time produce a grinding paste that accelerates component wear.
*Oil drip feed systems continuously lubricate the chain and use light oil that does not stick to the chain. Research has shown that oil drip feed systems provide the greatest wear protection and greatest power saving.

==Variants==

If the chain is not being used for a high wear application (for instance if it is just transmitting motion from a hand-operated lever to a control shaft on a machine, or a sliding door on an oven), then one of the simpler types of chain may still be used. Conversely, where extra strength but the smooth drive of a smaller pitch is required, the chain may be &quot;siamesed&quot;; instead of just two rows of plates on the outer sides of the chain, there may be three (&quot;duplex&quot;), four (&quot;triplex&quot;), or more rows of plates running parallel, with bushings and rollers between each adjacent pair, and the same number of rows of teeth running in parallel on the sprockets to match. Timing chains on automotive engines, for example, typically have multiple rows of plates called strands.

Roller chain is made in several sizes, the most common American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards being 40, 50, 60, and 80. The first digits indicate the pitch of the chain in eighths of an inch, with the last digit being 0 for standard chain, 1 for lightweight chain, and 5 for bushed chain with no rollers. Thus, a chain with half-inch pitch is a No. 40 while a No. 160 sprocket has teeth spaced 2 inches apart, etc. Metric pitches are expressed in sixteenths of an inch; thus a metric No. 8 chain (08B-1) is equivalent to an ANSI No. 40. Most roller chain is made from plain carbon or alloy steel, but stainless steel is used in food processing machinery or other places where lubrication is a problem, and nylon or brass are occasionally seen for the same reason.

Roller chain is ordinarily hooked up using a master link (also known as a &quot;connecting link&quot;), which typically has one pin held by a horseshoe clip rather than friction fit, allowing it to be inserted or removed with simple tools. Chain with a removable link or pin is also known as &quot;cottered chain&quot;, which allows the length of the chain to be adjusted. Half links (also known as &quot;offsets&quot;) are available and are used to increase the length of the chain by a single roller. Riveted roller chain has the master link (also known as a &quot;connecting link&quot;) &quot;riveted&quot; or mashed on the ends. These pins are made to be durable and are not removable.

===Horseshoe clip===
A &quot;horseshoe clip&quot; is the U-shaped spring steel fitting that holds the side-plate of the joining (or &quot;master&quot;) link formerly essential to complete the loop of a roller chain. The clip method is losing popularity as more and more chains are manufactured as endless loops not intended for maintenance. Modern motorcycles are often fitted with an endless chain but in the increasingly rare circumstances of the chain wearing out and needing to be replaced, a length of chain and a joining link (with horseshoe clip) will be provided as a spare. Changes in motorcycle suspension are tending to make this use less prevalent.

Common on older motorcycles and older bicycles (e.g. those with hub gears) this clip method cannot be used on bicycles fitted with derailleur gears, as the clip will tend to catch on the gear-changers. 

In many cases, an endless chain cannot be replaced easily since it is linked into the frame of the machine (this is the case on the traditional bicycle, amongst other places). However, in some cases, a joining link with horseshoe clip cannot be used or is not preferred in the application either. In this case, a &quot;soft link&quot; is used, placed with a chain riveter and relying solely on friction. With modern materials and tools and skilled application this is a permanent repair having almost the same strength and life of the unbroken chain.

==Use==
* Roller chains are used in low- to mid-speed drives at around 600 to 800 feet per minute; however, at higher speeds, around 2,000 to 3,000 feet per minute, V-belts are normally used due to wear and noise issues.
* A bicycle chain is a form of roller chain. Bicycle chains may have a master link, or may require a chain tool for removal and installation. A similar but larger and thus stronger chain is used on most motorcycles although it is sometimes replaced by either a toothed belt or a shaft drive, which offer lower noise level and fewer maintenance requirements.
* Some automobile engines use roller chains to drive the camshafts. Very high performance engines often use gear drive, and starting in the early 1960s toothed belts were used by some manufacturers. 
* Chains are also used in forklifts using hydraulic rams as a pulley to raise and lower the carriage; however, these chains are not considered roller chains, but are classified as lift or leaf chains.
* Chainsaw cutting chains superficially resemble roller chains but are more closely related to leaf chains. They are driven by projecting drive links which also serve to locate the chain onto the bar.

*A perhaps unusual use of a pair of motorcycle chains is in the Harrier jump jet, where a chain drive from an air motor is used to rotate the movable engine nozzles, allowing them to be pointed downwards for hovering flight, or to the rear for normal forward flight, a system known as &quot;thrust vectoring&quot;.

==Wear==
The effect of wear on a roller chain is to increase the pitch (spacing of the links), causing the chain to grow longer. Note that this is due to wear at the pivoting pins and bushes, not from actual stretching of the metal (as does happen to some flexible steel components such as the hand-brake cable of a motor vehicle).

With modern chains it is unusual for a chain (other than that of a bicycle) to wear until it breaks, since a worn chain leads to the rapid onset of wear on the teeth of the sprockets, with ultimate failure being the loss of all the teeth on the sprocket. The sprockets (in particular the smaller of the two) suffer a grinding motion that puts a characteristic hook shape into the driven face of the teeth. (This effect is made worse by a chain improperly tensioned, but is unavoidable no matter what care is taken). The worn teeth (and chain) no longer provides smooth transmission of power and this may become evident from the noise, the vibration or (in car engines using a timing chain) the variation in ignition timing seen with a timing light. Both sprockets and chain should be replaced in these cases, since a new chain on worn sprockets will not last long. However, in less severe cases it may be possible to save the larger of the two sprockets, since it is always the smaller one that suffers the most wear. Only in very light-weight applications such as a bicycle, or in extreme cases of improper tension, will the chain normally jump off the sprockets.

The lengthening due to wear of a chain is calculated by the following formula:

formula_1

M = the length of a number of links measured

S = the number of links measured

P = Pitch

In industry, it is usual to monitor the movement of the chain tensioner (whether manual or automatic) or the exact length of a drive chain (one rule of thumb is to replace a roller chain which has elongated 3% on an adjustable drive or 1.5% on a fixed-center drive). A simpler method, particularly suitable for the cycle or motorcycle user, is to attempt to pull the chain away from the larger of the two sprockets, whilst ensuring the chain is taut. Any significant movement (e.g. making it possible to see through a gap) probably indicates a chain worn up to and beyond the limit. Sprocket damage will result if the problem is ignored. Sprocket wear cancels this effect, and may mask chain wear.

===Bicycle chain wear===

The lightweight chain of a bicycle with derailleur gears can snap (or rather, come apart at the side-plates, since it is normal for the &quot;riveting&quot; to fail first) because the pins inside are not cylindrical, they are barrel-shaped. Contact between the pin and the bushing is not the regular line, but a point which allows the chain&#x27;s pins to work its way through the bushing, and finally the roller, ultimately causing the chain to snap. This form of construction is necessary because the gear-changing action of this form of transmission requires the chain to both bend sideways and to twist, but this can occur with the flexibility of such a narrow chain and relatively large free lengths on a bicycle.

Chain failure is much less of a problem on hub-geared systems since the chainline does not bend, so the parallel pins have a much bigger wearing surface in contact with the bush. The hub-gear system also allows complete enclosure, a great aid to lubrication and protection from grit.

== Chain strength ==
The most common measure of roller chain&#x27;s strength is tensile strength. Tensile strength represents how much load a chain can withstand under a one-time load before breaking. Just as important as tensile strength is a chain&#x27;s fatigue strength. The critical factors in a chain&#x27;s fatigue strength is the quality of steel used to manufacture the chain, the heat treatment of the chain components, the quality of the pitch hole fabrication of the linkplates, and the type of shot plus the intensity of shot peen coverage on the linkplates. Other factors can include the thickness of the linkplates and the design (contour) of the linkplates. The rule of thumb for roller chain operating on a continuous drive is for the chain load to not exceed a mere 1/6 or 1/9 of the chain&#x27;s tensile strength, depending on the type of master links used (press-fit vs. slip-fit). Roller chains operating on a continuous drive beyond these thresholds can and typically do fail prematurely via linkplate fatigue failure.

The standard minimum ultimate strength of the ANSI 29.1 steel chain is 12,500 x (pitch, in inches)2. 
X-ring and O-Ring chains greatly decrease wear by means of internal lubricants, increasing chain life. The internal lubrication is inserted by means of a vacuum when riveting the chain together.

==Chain standards==
Standards organizations (such as ANSI and ISO) maintain standards for design, dimensions, and interchangeability of transmission chains. For example, the following table shows data from ANSI standard B29.1-2011 (precision power transmission roller chains, attachments, and sprockets) developed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). See the references for additional information.
For mnemonic purposes, below is another presentation of key dimensions from the same standard, expressed in fractions of an inch (which was part of the thinking behind the choice of preferred numbers in the ANSI standard):

A typical bicycle chain (for derailleur gears) uses narrow -inch-pitch chain. The width of the chain is variable, and does not affect the load capacity. The more sprockets at the rear wheel (historically 3–6, nowadays 7–12 sprockets), the narrower the chain. Chains are sold according to the number of speeds they are designed to work with, for example, &quot;10 speed chain&quot;. Hub gear or single speed bicycles use 1/2 x 1/8 inch chains, where 1/8 inch refers to the maximum thickness of a sprocket that can be used with the chain.

Typically chains with parallel shaped links have an even number of links, with each narrow link followed by a broad one. Chains built up with a uniform type of link, narrow at one and broad at the other end, can be made with an odd number of links, which can be an advantage to adapt to a special chainwheel-distance; on the other side such a chain tends to be not so strong.

Roller chains made using ISO standard are sometimes called &quot;isochains&quot;.

<text>Pierre Commoy and Gilles Blanchard, also known as Pierre et Gilles, are French artists and romantic partners. They have been producing works together since 1976, creating a world where painting and photography meet. Their art is peopled by their friends and family, anonymous and famous, who appear in sophisticated life-size sets the artists build in their studio. They meticulously apply paint to the photographs once printed on canvas. Accomplished image creators, Pierre and Gilles have built up an extraordinary contemporary iconography on the frontier between art history and popular culture.

Pierre et Gilles have sometimes attracted controversy. For example, in 2012 there was a public outcry in Austria when their work entitled &quot;Vive la France&quot; was displayed on large street posters to advertise the &quot;Nackte Männer&quot; (English: &quot;Naked Men&quot;) exhibition created by Ilse Haider at the Leopold Museum in Vienna. It depicts three naked French footballers with their genitals fully revealed: the first black, the second Arab and the third white, to represent the multi-ethnic composition of modern French society. The ensuing controversy led to an act of self-censorship by the artists, who decided that the largest street posters should be changed, and instead use coloured ribbons to hide the players&#x27; genitals.

==Biography==

Pierre Commoy, the photographer, was born in 1950 in La Roche-sur-Yon. Gilles Blanchard, the painter, was born in 1953 in Le Havre. In the early 1970s, Blanchard took a degree at the &quot;École des Beaux-Arts&quot; in Le Havre, while Commoy studied photography in Geneva.

In 1974, Blanchard moved to Paris to paint and make illustrations for magazines and advertisements. Commoy started working as a photographer for the magazines &quot;Rock &amp; Folk&quot;, &quot;Dépèche Mode&quot; and &quot;Interview&quot;.

In autumn 1976, Commoy and Blanchard met at the inauguration of a Kenzo boutique in Paris, and started living together in an apartment in Rue des Blancs-Manteaux that they also use as a studio. Next year they started working together; Blanchard would do the painting and Commoy took the photos. Their public breakthrough came with their images for the magazine &quot;Façade&quot;, with portraits of Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger and Iggy Pop.

In 1979, Pierre et Gilles moved to the Bastille quarter, made their first works for Thierry Mugler, designed record sleeves for artist friends, and shot fashion ads and portraits for magazines. They also made their first trip to India, a country which has inspired much of their work.

In 1983, Pierre et Gilles had their first personal show at Galerie Texbraun in Paris.

In 1984, Pierre et Gilles worked extensively for musical artists like Mikado (for whom they directed their first video), Sandii, Etienne Daho, Sheila and Krootchey.

In 1987, Pierre et Gilles again travelled to India, and started working on religious and mythological themes.

In 1989, Pierre et Gilles became friends with Marc Almond, with whom they would work for many years.

In 1993, Pierre et Gilles were awarded the &quot;Grand Prix de Photographie&quot; by the City of Paris; and produced art work for Absolut Vodka.

Pierre et Gilles&#x27; first retrospective exhibition was in 1996, at the &quot;Maison Européenne de la Photographie&quot; in Paris.

In 1997 Pierre et Gilles notably participated in Mike Aho&#x27;s documentary on them titled &quot;Pierre and Gilles, Love Stories&quot;.

In 2000, Pierre et Gilles had a major retrospective at the New Museum in New York.

In 2007, Pierre et Gilles had a major retrospective at the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris.

In 2012, Pierre et Gilles exhibited a work entitled &quot;Vive la France&quot; in several art galleries across Europe. It depicts three naked French footballers with their genitals fully revealed: the first black, the second Arab/Muslim and the third white, to represent the multi-ethnic composition of modern French society. It attracted controversy across Austria when it was displayed on large street posters to advertise the &quot;Naked Men&quot; exhibition created by Ilse Haider at the Leopold Museum in Vienna, with the result that coloured ribbons were used on the largest posters to hide the players&#x27; genitals.

In 2014, Pierre et Gilles unveiled a major new exhibition, &quot;Héros,&quot; at Galerie Daniel Templon in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/look/gallery/2279/pierre-gilles&quot;&gt;Pierre et Gilles&#x27; heroes.

<doc id="569867" wikidata="Q1752790" url="?curid=569867" title="Romance (1999 film)">
<text>Romance (Romance X) is a 1999 French arthouse film written and directed by Catherine Breillat. It stars Caroline Ducey, Rocco Siffredi, Sagamore Stévenin and François Berléand. According to Breillat, her other movie &quot;Anatomy of Hell&quot; is a &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;Romance&quot;.

==Plot==
Marie, a school teacher, is in a romantic relationship with Paul, but she is disappointed in his comparative lack of interest in sexual activity. One morning, Marie drives to a bar, where she meets Paolo; the two later have sex.

One day, Roberto, the headmaster, brings Marie to her house. The two begin engaging in BDSM until Marie asks him to stop, though she confesses to have imagined what it&#x27;s like to be bound and implies that she enjoyed being gagged. On the way home, a man rapes Marie in the stairway; he leaves right as Paul returns, but the latter does not see her.

Upon returning home after a session with Roberto, Paul demonstrates interest in sex and manages to accidentally impregnate Marie. After one checkup during which the doctor reveals the baby&#x27;s gender, the couple have sex for the first time in months – but also the last.

After an unhappy night out in a bar, Marie wakes up about to go into labor but Paul is out cold. Frustrated, she turns on the gas and leaves, with Roberto driving her to the hospital. She successfully delivers the child and as expected, Paul dies in the gas explosion. As his coffin is being lowered into the ground, Marie watches from a distance, the baby in her arms.

==Cast==
* Caroline Ducey as Marie
* Sagamore Stévenin as Paul
* François Berléand as Robert
* Rocco Siffredi as Paolo
* Ashley Wanninger as Ashley
* Emma Colberti as Charlotte
* Fabien de Jomaron as Claude

==Production==
In an interview with The Post, Catherine Breillat appeared to confirm the rumors of actual on-set sex. &quot;An actor never pretends,&quot; she said. &quot;At the same time, I&#x27;m not perverse. I don&#x27;t impose on my actors or actresses any more than is absolutely necessary. But I don&#x27;t pretend. I don&#x27;t simulate. The deal was, we&#x27;d go as far as we had to, as far as the film required.&quot; Caroline Ducey accepted the part of Marie knowing that &#x27;going all the way&#x27; was written into her contract. Apparently, Ducey began the film thinking that it would also be an exit from the sexual relationship she was in, but then decided while it was being made that she wanted to stay with her boyfriend. By the end, she was in a state of considerable distress.

The film features explicit copulation scenes, especially one showing Ducey&#x27;s coitus with Siffredi.

==Release and classification==
In Europe, &quot;Romance&quot; was released mainstream; in the United States, it was reduced to a mainstream-acceptable R rating, and the European original version is unrated. In the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Classification passed the film uncut for cinemas, though home releases suffered a brief cut to an ejaculation shot.

In March 2004, the original version was broadcast on late-night German public television. In Australia, the original version was broadcast uncut on cable television network World Movies. Although initially refused classification, it was eventually awarded an R18+ on appeal. It singlehandedly paved the way for actual sex to be accommodated in the R18+ classification in Australia.

In Canada, particularly in Alberta and the Maritimes, the film&#x27;s explicit sexual content was seen as gratuitous and it was given an A rating and XXX rating in those regions. In June 2008, in the Netherlands, the original version was broadcast on Dutch public TV by VPRO as one of a series of &quot;Erotica&quot; arthouse cinema.

==Controversy==
In 2024, Ducey published the autobiographical book &quot;La Prédation (nom féminin&quot;, translatable to &quot;The Predation (Feminine Noun)&quot;. In it, she recounts the traumatizing sexual assault she endured during the filming, notably the staircase sexual assault scene, for which she holds Breillat responsible. 

Before getting to the filming, Ducey had addressed her concerns over explicit sexual assault scenes involving simulated cunnilingus and sodomy in the script to Breillat, who brushed them off as simple context clues and plot devices to help her study the character and advance the story, and reassured the actress, that not everything on script was to be pictured on-screen. On the day of the shooting, however, Ducey was confronted by a different reality, as she learnt that the scene of the simulated act was to be shot explicitly. Breillat even asked her to take off her pantyhose and pull down her underwear to make the scene more realistic. 

Ducey, trusting of Breillat, complied, and as everyone on set proceeded with the filming, the actor portraying the predator took the liberty of performing an unsimulated act of cunnilingus on her, without her consent of former notice by anyone involved with the film, including Breillat. Ducey says she felt paralyzed in her movements and speech, while she still kept a modicum of consciousness, and that she jolted back to her senses because of the sound of tape running out, before threatening the actor to stop. Ducey writes about seeing director Breillat masturbate the male actor so he could maintain an erection throughout the second take, which started right after, and was fully simulated, this time around.

Ducey claims that a clause in her contract explicity stated that the film would under no condition be classified as pornography, and that she would not participate in any unsimulated sex scenes during the filming. Breillat, responding to these accusations, however, says while such scenes were not in her contract, the actress agreed on filming them regardless, a statement that the actress doubled down on refuting in a sit-down interview for the French short-format media and cultural news outlet Konbini.

<doc id="569869" wikidata="Q2317866" url="?curid=569869" title="Artist trading cards">
<text>Artist trading cards (ATCs) is a conceptual art project initiated by the Swiss artist M. Vänçi Stirnemann in 1997. He called it a &quot;Collaborative Cultural Performance&quot;. Artist trading cards are 2.5 by 3.5 inches in size, the same format as modern trading cards (such as hockey cards or baseball cards) or playing cards. They are self-made unique works or small series, signed and dated on the reverse by the artist/producer, exchanged and collected by the people who participate in the collaboration.

==The project==
In 1996, Stirnemann began making small artworks the size of commercial trading cards. An exhibition of 1200 of Stirnemann&#x27;s cards ran at his second-hand bookshop and gallery INK.art&amp;text in Zürich, Switzerland between 23 April and 31 May 1997. The exhibition ended with a trading session. The ATC project was intended to allow people from different backgrounds to participate in an ongoing art project, which was not part of the art market. Selling or buying ATCs clearly contradicts the initial idea. Instead, people would meet at trading sessions and exchange their art work in a democratic face to face situation. Anybody can participate in the project and all techniques are allowed. ATCs are produced in various media, including dry media (pencils, pens, markers, etc.), wet media (watercolor, acrylic paints, etc.), paper media (in the form of collage, papercuts, found objects, etc.), or even metals, fiber, wax and other materials.

A few weeks after the first ATC exhibition and trading session in Zürich, the Canadian artist Don Mabie adopted the idea and showed artist trading cards at the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary, Canada. In September 1997, a trading session was organized at the New Gallery in Calgary. Today, there are regular trading sessions in more than 30 cities in Europe, Canada, the US and Australia. The Zürich and Calgary trading sessions are still held on a monthly basis.

==Exhibitions and editions==
In April 1998, editions were shown at the Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart, Germany, and in June and July 1998 shows and trading sessions were organized in Arnhem and Nijmegen, the Netherlands. In July 1998, the New Gallery in Calgary showed &quot;Hot Town: Artist Trading Cards in the Summer&quot; (curated by Don Mabie). From 15 October until 27 December 1998, an exhibition of artist trading cards (copy-left editions) took place at the Kunsthaus Zürich in Switzerland, and in May 1999, the Kunsthaus Aarau (also in Switzerland) organized a show and trading event as part of the &quot;Salon 99&quot; exhibition. In September 2000, a first &quot;Artist Trading Cards Biennial&quot; (curated by Don Mabie and M. Vänçi Stirnemann) was taking place in the New Gallery in Calgary, Canada, and in 2003, there was a large exhibition at the Kunstverein Stuttgart in Stuttgart, Germany. In May 2002, the fifth anniversary of the project was celebrated with a trading session at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zürich. In subsequent years, shows and exhibitions took place in many places in Europe, Canada, the US and Australia. ATCs were published in different catalogues, mostly performance catalogues or small press magazines.

Between 1997 and 2004, Stirnemann published 333 ATC editions (copy-left edition). For each edition of 20 copies 15 people contributed 20 ATCs. Altogether, more than 800 people from 40 countries participated in the edition project. In 2002, Cat Schick started publishing editions of &quot;Sister Trading Cards&quot; (STCs) with ATCs from women only.

==Historical context==

The artist trading card project builds on different traditions. Miniature art has been in existence for centuries tracing its heritage back to the illustrated manuscripts of scribes in the Far East and Europe prior to the 15th century. The origin of modern trading cards is associated with cigarette cards first issued by the US-based Allen and Ginter tobacco company in 1875. They were the precursors of the sport cards and other trading cards. An important influence for the ATC concept were art movements of the 20th century which advocated a more popular art: Art not for museums or auctions but from and within everyday life. In this respect, the ATC project has affinity with the Fluxus movement and with Robert Filliou&#x27;s notions of a &quot;fête permanente&quot;, a &quot;création permanente&quot;, or an &quot;eternal network&quot;. The &quot;art of participation&quot; as an interactive process can be traced back to the 1950s, and it developed within different genres like performance art and happenings, action art, mail art, or later computer art.

==Commercialization==
The core purpose of the ATC concept was a free exchange between the participants to establish a rapport (&quot;collaborative performance&quot;). In order to allow for profit gain and non artist collection, both the concept of a mutual exchange and the name of the cards were altered (while the size was kept). In 2004, a first ATCs offshoot was organized on eBay by Lisa Luree (eBay name bone*diva). To circumvent intellectual property rights, she called it &quot;Art Cards, Editions and Originals&quot; (ACEOs). It was the beginning of what an eBay staff member two years later called &quot;eBay&#x27;s home grown art movement&quot;. In 2005, Jillian Crider started the &quot;Small Format Art Group&quot; on eBay, which allowed for works &quot;no more than 14 inches in any one direction&quot;. Whereas ATCs are rather shown in museums and special exhibitions (usually accompanied by a trading session), ACEOs are sold on auction sites, collected privately and reproduced in craft tutorials or other publications.

<text>BBC Radio Sheffield is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving South Yorkshire, north Derbyshire and North Nottinghamshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital television and via BBC Sounds from studios on Shoreham Street in Sheffield.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 147,000 listeners and a 3.7% share as of December 2023.

==History==

BBC Radio Sheffield was the second BBC local radio station, launching on 15 November 1967 and broadcasting from a large Victorian house in Westbourne Road in the Broomhill area of the city.

Until the mid-1980s, the station was generally on air from the morning until the early evening, with any programming after 6 pm devoted to specialist music and magazines aimed at minority interests and ethnic communities. These programmes did not broadcast all year round. In August 1986, evening programmes began on a permanent basis when the station joined with the other three BBC stations in Yorkshire to provide an early evening service of specialist music programmes on weeknights from 6 pm to 7:30 pm, extending a year later to six days a week (Wednesday to Monday) between 7 pm and 9 pm with Tuesdays reserved for local sports coverage. Just under two years later, on 29 May 1989, the BBC Night Network launched, which saw the BBC local radio stations in the North East and Yorkshire broadcasting networked programming every evening from 6:05 pm (6 pm at the weekend) until midnight, extending to 12:30 am in the early 1990s, and to 1 am by the end of that decade.

Spring 1989 also saw BBC Radio Sheffield launch &quot;Ten-35&quot;. This was a weekend service of programmes for the county&#x27;s ethnic minority communities and was broadcast on the station&#x27;s MW frequency, hence the name of the strand. Radio Sheffield had provided programmes for the Asian and black communities for many years, but the new service saw the launch of programmes for many other communities. The service was broadcast on Saturday and Sunday evenings between 6 pm and midnight, although the Sunday programming was brought forward to 2:45 pm to 8:30 pm in around 1991 and was called &quot;Ten-35 Sunday&quot;. Over time, the service was dismantled and eventually programming for minority communities was again focused on the county&#x27;s black and Asian communities.

===Archives===
In March 1982, archiving began of the station&#x27;s early material, by cataloguing and transferring it to audio cassette. The first items archived were news reports of the steel strike of 1980. The cassettes and listings, which include news stories and local music, are held at Sheffield City Archives in Sheffield. This archiving followed a scheme by Radio Carlisle which covered the October 1957 Windscale nuclear accident.

==Technical==

The 104.1 FM signal is broadcast from the Holme Moss transmitter in West Yorkshire, near the border with Derbyshire, enabling the signal to be clearly heard in north Sheffield, Barnsley, north Rotherham, Doncaster and parts of Nottinghamshire.

The 88.6 FM signal is broadcast from the Crosspool transmitter on Tapton Hill to serve Sheffield and parts of Rotherham. It also broadcasts DAB on 11C multiplex for Sheffield and surrounding areas and it broadcasts DTR for South Yorkshire and surrounding areas for Freeview TV channel 716 on UHF 27-522 MHz the BBCA multiplex.

The 94.7 FM signal is broadcast from the Chesterfield transmitter and serves Derbyshire, parts of Nottinghamshire and the East of South Yorkshire. It broadcasts DAB on 11C multiplex (same as Crosspool transmitter) for the Chesterfield and North Derbyshire area. It also broadcasts DTR for Chesterfield for Freeview TV channel 716 on UHF 26-514 MHz on the BBCA multiplex.

A DAB signal is broadcast from the Clifton transmitter (next to the M18 east of Rotherham) to serve Rotherham, Doncaster, Worksop and surrounding areas. Another DAB signal is broadcast from Ardsley transmitter east of Barnsley to serve Barnsley, Dearne Valley and parts of West Yorkshire. Plus, its DAB signals are also broadcast from the Clarborough transmitter near Retford to cover parts of North Nottinghamshire and strengthen signals from the Clifton transmitter. The three transmitters use the Bauer South Yorkshire 11C multiplex (same as Crosspool and Chesterfield transmitters).

The Emley Moor transmitter broadcasts DTR for Freeview TV channel 716 for Yorkshire, Derbyshire and parts of Lincolnshire on UHF 47-682 MHz the BBCA multiplex. Other local TV transmitters such as Crosspool relay their signal from Emley Moor.

The station also streams online via BBC Sounds.

While the FM, DAB and Freeview transmissions of BBC Radio Sheffield officially cover North Nottinghamshire, including the district of Bassetlaw which includes the towns of Retford and Worksop, editorially, news output is covered by BBC Radio Nottingham via its radio and internet news and social media channels, despite the area being officially outside the coverage area of BBC Radio Nottingham.

In its early years, Radio Sheffield transmitted from Rotherham (Boston Castle) on 95.0 MHz FM. This was discontinued when a powerful transmitter opened at Holme Moss serving much of South Yorkshire on 97.4 MHz, later changing to its current 104.1 MHz (97.4 MHz was then passed to Radio Hallam).

The ownership of FM radios was low when Radio Sheffield began broadcasting on FM only in 1967. However, most people could receive AM (medium wave (MW) and long wave (LW)) and, in response to the impending competition of commercial radio which would also broadcast on MW (Radio Hallam started in 1974), Radio Sheffield began transmitting in late 1973 on 1034 kHz (290 metres) MW – this changed to 1035 kHz in 1978. This was broadcast from the Broadfield Road transmitter in Sheffield (behind Heeley swimming baths) and served South Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and parts of Lincolnshire and West Yorkshire. The MW broadcasts were discontinued on 27 May 2021.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Sheffield studios from 6 am to 2 pm each day and for sports coverage.

The station usually broadcasts the whole of the Late Night programme, a programme carried by all BBC local radio stations (except in the case of sports coverage), which is broadcast between 10pm and 1am.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Sheffield simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio London.

<doc id="569879" wikidata="Q412542" url="?curid=569879" title="Nociceptor">
<text>A nociceptor (; ) is a sensory neuron that responds to damaging or potentially damaging stimuli by sending &quot;possible threat&quot; signals to the spinal cord and the brain. The brain creates the sensation of pain to direct attention to the body part, so the threat can be mitigated; this process is called nociception.

==Terminology==
Nociception and pain are usually evoked only by pressures and temperatures that are potentially damaging to tissues. This barrier or threshold contrasts with the more sensitive visual, auditory, olfactory, taste, and somatosensory responses to stimuli. The experience of pain is individualistic and can be suppressed by stress or exacerbated by anticipation. Simple activation of a nociceptor does not always lead to perceived pain, because the latter also depends on the frequency of the action potentials, integration of pre- and postsynaptic signals, and influences from higher or central processes.

==Scientific investigation==
Nociceptors were discovered by Charles Scott Sherrington in 1906. In earlier centuries, scientists believed that animals were like mechanical devices that transformed the energy of sensory stimuli into motor responses. Sherrington used many different experiments to demonstrate that different types of stimulation to an afferent nerve fiber&#x27;s receptive field led to different responses. Some intense stimuli trigger reflex withdrawal, certain autonomic responses, and pain. The specific receptors for these intense stimuli were called nociceptors.

Studies of nociceptors have been conducted on conscious humans as well as surrogate animal models. The process is difficult due to invasive methods that could change the cellular activity of nociceptors being studied, the inability to record from small neuronal structures, and uncertainties in animal model systems as to whether a response should be attributed to pain or some other factor.

==Location==
In mammals, nociceptors are found in any area of the body that can sense noxious stimuli. External nociceptors are found in tissue such as the skin (cutaneous nociceptors), the corneas, and the mucosa. Internal nociceptors are found in a variety of organs, such as the muscles, the joints, the bladder, the visceral organs, and the digestive tract. The cell bodies of these neurons are located in either the dorsal root ganglia or the trigeminal ganglia. The trigeminal ganglia are specialized nerves for the face, whereas the dorsal root ganglia are associated with the rest of the body. The axons extend into the peripheral nervous system and terminate in branches to form receptive fields.

==Types and functions==
Nociceptors are usually electrically silent when not stimulated. The peripheral terminal of the mature nociceptor is where the noxious stimuli are detected and transduced into electrical energy. When the electrical energy reaches a threshold value, an action potential is induced and driven towards the central nervous system (CNS). This leads to the train of events that allows for the conscious awareness of pain. The sensory specificity of nociceptors is established by the high threshold only to particular features of stimuli. Only when the high threshold has been reached by either chemical, thermal, or mechanical environments are the nociceptors triggered.

In terms of their conduction velocity, nociceptors come in two groups. The Aδ fiber axons are myelinated and can allow an action potential to travel towards the CNS at speeds from 5 to 30 meters/second. The C fiber axons conduct more slowly at speeds from 0.4 to 2 meters/second due to their smaller diameters and little or no myelination of their axon. As a result, pain comes in two phases: an initial extremely sharp pain associated with the Aδ fibers and a second, more prolonged and slightly less intense feeling of pain from the C fibers. Massive or prolonged input to a C fiber results in a progressive build up in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord; this phenomenon called wind-up is similar to tetanus in muscles. Wind-up increases the probability of greater sensitivity to pain.

===Thermal===
Thermal nociceptors are activated by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures. There are specific nociceptor transducers that are responsible for how and if the specific nerve ending responds to the thermal stimulus. The first to be discovered was TRPV1, and it has a threshold that coincides with the heat pain temperature of 43 °C. Other temperature in the warm–hot range is mediated by more than one TRP channel. Each of these channels express a particular C-terminal domain that corresponds to the warm–hot sensitivity. The interactions between all these channels and how the temperature level is determined to be above the pain threshold are unknown at this time. The cool stimuli are sensed by TRPM8 channels. Its C-terminal domain differs from the heat sensitive TRPs. Although this channel corresponds to cool stimuli, it is still unknown whether it also contributes in the detection of intense cold. An interesting finding related to cold stimuli is that tactile sensibility and motor function deteriorate while pain perception persists.

===Mechanical===
Mechanical nociceptors respond to excess pressure or mechanical deformation. They also respond to incisions that break the skin surface. The reaction to the stimulus is processed as pain by the cortex, just like chemical and thermal responses. These mechanical nociceptors frequently have polymodal characteristics. So it is possible that some of the transducers for thermal stimuli are the same for mechanical stimuli. The same is true for chemical stimuli, since TRPA1 appears to detect both mechanical and chemical changes. Some mechanical stimuli can cause release of intermediate chemicals, such as ATP, which can be detected by P2 purinergic receptors, or nerve growth factor, which can be detected by tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA).

===Chemical===
Chemical nociceptors have TRP channels that respond to a wide variety of spices. The one that sees the most response and is very widely tested is capsaicin. Other chemical stimulants are environmental irritants like acrolein, a World War I chemical weapon and a component of cigarette smoke. Apart from these external stimulants, chemical nociceptors have the capacity to detect endogenous ligands, and certain fatty acid amines that arise from changes in internal tissues. Like in thermal nociceptors, TRPV1 can detect chemicals like capsaicin and spider toxins and acids. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC) also detect acidity.

===Sleeping/silent===
Although each nociceptor can have a variety of possible threshold levels, some do not respond at all to chemical, thermal or mechanical stimuli unless injury actually has occurred. These are typically referred to as silent or sleeping nociceptors since their response comes only on the onset of inflammation to the surrounding tissue. They were identified using electrical stimulation of their receptive field.

===Polymodal===
Nociceptors that respond to more than one type of stimuli are called &quot;polymodal&quot;. They are the most common type of C-fiber nociceptors and express a rich repertoire of neurotransmitters.

Afferent nociceptive fibers (those that send information &quot;to&quot;, rather than &quot;from&quot; the brain) travel back to the spinal cord where they form synapses in its dorsal horn. This nociceptive fiber (located in the periphery) is a first order neuron. The cells in the dorsal horn are divided into physiologically distinct layers called laminae. Different fiber types form synapses in different layers, and use either glutamate or substance P as the neurotransmitter. Aδ fibers form synapses in laminae I and V, C fibers connect with neurons in lamina II, Aβ fibers connect with lamina I, III, &amp; V. After reaching the specific lamina within the spinal cord, the first order nociceptive project to second order neurons that cross the midline at the anterior white commissure. The second order neurons then send their information via two pathways to the thalamus: the dorsal column medial-lemniscal system and the anterolateral system. The former is reserved more for regular non-painful sensation, while the latter is reserved for pain sensation. Upon reaching the thalamus, the information is processed in the ventral posterior nucleus and sent to the cerebral cortex in the brain via fibers in the posterior limb of the internal capsule.

===Descending===
As there is an ascending pathway to the brain that initiates the conscious realization of pain, there also is a descending pathway which modulates pain sensation. The brain can request the release of specific hormones or chemicals that can have analgesic effects which can reduce or inhibit pain sensation. The area of the brain that stimulates the release of these hormones is the hypothalamus. This effect of descending inhibition can be shown by electrically stimulating the periaqueductal grey area of the midbrain or the periventricular nucleus. They both in turn project to other areas involved in pain regulation, such as the nucleus raphe magnus which also receives similar afferents from the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis (NPG). In turn the nucleus raphe magnus projects to the substantia gelatinosa region of the dorsal horn and mediates the sensation of spinothalamic inputs. This is done first by the nucleus raphe magnus sending serotoninergic neurons to neurons in the dorsal cord, that in turn secrete enkephalin to the interneurons that carry pain perception. Enkephalin functions by binding opioid receptors to cause inhibition of the post-synaptic neuron, thus inhibiting pain. The periaqueductal grey also contains opioid receptors which explains one of the mechanisms by which opioids such as morphine and diacetylmorphine exhibit an analgesic effect.

==Sensitivity==
Nociceptor sensitivity is modulated by a large variety of mediators in the extracellular space, such as toxic and inflammatory molecules. Peripheral sensitization represents a form of functional plasticity of the nociceptor. The nociceptor can change from being simply a noxious stimulus detector to a detector of non-noxious stimuli. The result is that low intensity stimuli from regular activity, initiates a painful sensation. This is commonly known as hyperalgesia. Inflammation is one common cause that results in the sensitization of nociceptors. Normally hyperalgesia ceases when inflammation goes down, however, sometimes genetic defects and/or repeated injury can result in allodynia: a completely non-noxious stimulus like light touch causes extreme pain. Allodynia can also be caused when a nociceptor is damaged in the peripheral nerves. This can result in deafferentation, which means the development of different central processes from the surviving afferent nerve. With this situation, surviving dorsal root axons of the nociceptors can make contact with the spinal cord, thus changing the normal input.

==Neural development==
Nociceptors develop from neural-crest stem cells during embryogenesis. The neural crest is responsible for a large part of early development in vertebrates. It is specifically responsible for development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The neural-crest stem cells split from the neural tube as it closes, and nociceptors grow from the dorsal part of this neural-crest tissue. They form late during neurogenesis. Earlier forming cells from this region can become non-pain sensing receptors, either proprioceptors or low-threshold mechanoreceptors. All neurons derived from the neural crest, including embryonic nociceptors, express the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), which is a receptor to nerve growth factor (NGF). However, transcription factors that determine the type of nociceptor remain unclear.

Following sensory neurogenesis, differentiation occurs, and two types of nociceptors are formed. They are classified as either peptidergic or nonpeptidergic nociceptors, each of which express a distinct repertoire of ion channels and receptors. Their specializations allow the receptors to innervate different central and peripheral targets. This differentiation occurs in both perinatal and postnatal periods. The nonpeptidergic nociceptors switch off the TrkA and begin expressing RET proto-oncogene, which is a transmembrane signaling component that allows the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). This transition is assisted by runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) which is vital in the development of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. On the contrary, the peptidergic nociceptors continue to use TrkA, and they express a completely different type of growth factor. There currently is a lot of research about the differences between nociceptors.

== In other animals==

Nociception has been documented in non-mammalian animals, including fish and a wide range of invertebrates, including leeches, nematode worms, sea slugs, and larval fruit flies. Although these neurons may have pathways and relationships to the central nervous system that are different from those of mammalian nociceptors, nociceptive neurons in non-mammals often fire in response to similar stimuli as mammals, such as high temperature (40 degrees C or more), low pH, capsaicin, and tissue damage.

For example, in fruit flies, specific multidendritic sensory neurons play a role in nociception. In mollusks, nociceptive responses are mediated by pedal sensory neurons. Crustaceans, on the other hand, utilize a variety of sensory cell types, including chordotonal organs and mechanoreceptors, to detect potentially damaging stimuli (see also Pain in crustaceans).

<text>A semi-arid climate, semi-desert climate, or steppe climate is a dry climate sub-type. It is located on regions that receive precipitation below potential evapotranspiration, but not as low as a desert climate. There are different kinds of semi-arid climates, depending on variables such as temperature, and they give rise to different biomes.

==Defining attributes of semi-arid climates==
A more precise definition is given by the Köppen climate classification, which treats steppe climates (&quot;BSh&quot; and &quot;BSk&quot;) as intermediates between desert climates (BW) and humid climates (A, C, D) in ecological characteristics and agricultural potential. Semi-arid climates tend to support short, thorny or scrubby vegetation and are usually dominated by either grasses or shrubs as they usually cannot support forests.
To determine if a location has a semi-arid climate, the precipitation threshold must first be determined. The method used to find the precipitation threshold (in millimeters):
* multiply by 20 the average annual temperature in degrees Celsius and then
** add 280 if at least 70% of the total precipitation falls in the summer half of the year (April–September in the northern hemisphere, October–March in the southern hemisphere)
** add 140 if 30–70% of the total precipitation falls in the summer half of the year
** add nothing if less than 30% of the total precipitation falls in the summer half of the year

If the area&#x27;s annual precipitation in millimeters is less than the threshold but more than half or 50% the threshold, it is classified as a &quot;BS&quot; (steppe, semi-desert, or semi-arid climate).

Furthermore, to delineate hot semi-arid climates from cold semi-arid climates, a mean annual temperature of is used as an isotherm. A location with a &quot;BS&quot;-type climate is classified as hot semi-arid (&quot;BSh&quot;) if its mean temperature is above this isotherm, and cold semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;) if not.

==Hot semi-arid climates==


Hot semi-arid climates (type &quot;BSh&quot;) tend to be located from the high teens to mid-30s latitudes of the tropics and subtropics, typically in proximity to regions with a tropical savanna climate or a humid subtropical climate. These climates tend to have hot, or sometimes extremely hot, summers and warm to cool winters, with some to minimal precipitation. Hot semi-arid climates are most commonly found around the fringes of subtropical deserts.

Hot semi-arid climates are most commonly found in Africa, Australia, and South Asia. In Australia, a large portion of the Outback surrounding the central desert regions lies within the hot semi-arid climate region. In South Asia, both India and parts of Pakistan experience the seasonal effects of monsoons and feature short but well-defined wet seasons, but are not sufficiently wet overall to qualify as either a tropical savanna or a humid subtropical climate.

Hot semi-arid climates can be also found in parts of North America, such as most of northern Mexico, the ABC Islands, the rain shadows of Hispaniola&#x27;s mountain ranges in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, parts of the Southwestern United States including California&#x27;s Central Valley, and sections of South America such as the &quot;sertão&quot;, the Gran Chaco, and the poleward side of the arid deserts, where they typically feature a Mediterranean precipitation pattern, with generally rainless summers and wetter winters. They are also found in few areas of Europe surrounding the Mediterranean Basin. In Europe, BSh climates are predominantly found in southeastern Spain. It can also be found primarily in parts of south Greece but also in marginal areas of Thessaloniki and Chalkidiki in north Greece, most of Formentera, marginal areas of Ibiza and marginal areas of Italy in Sicily, Sardinia and Lampedusa.

==Cold semi-arid climates==


Cold semi-arid climates (type &quot;BSk&quot;) tend to be located in elevated portions of temperate zones generally from the mid-30s to low 50s latitudes, typically bordering a humid continental climate or a Mediterranean climate. They are also typically found in continental interiors some distance from large bodies of water. Cold semi-arid climates usually feature warm to hot dry summers, though their summers are typically not quite as hot as those of hot semi-arid climates. Unlike hot semi-arid climates, areas with cold semi-arid climates tend to have cold and possibly freezing winters. These areas usually see some snowfall during the winter, though snowfall is much lower than at locations at similar latitudes with more humid climates.

Areas featuring cold semi-arid climates tend to have higher elevations than areas with hot semi-arid climates, and tend to feature major temperature swings between day and night, sometimes by as much as 20 °C (36 °F) or more. These large diurnal temperature variations are seldom seen in hot semi-arid climates. Cold semi-arid climates at higher latitudes tend to have dry winters and wetter summers, while cold semi-arid climates at lower latitudes tend to have precipitation patterns more akin to Mediterranean climates, with dry summers, relatively wet winters, and even wetter springs and autumns.

Cold semi-arid climates are most commonly found in central Asia and the western US, as well as the Middle East and other parts of Asia. However, they can also be found in Northern Africa, South Africa, sections of South America, sections of interior southern Australia (e.g. Kalgoorlie and Mildura) and inland Spain.

<doc id="569885" wikidata="Q957718" url="?curid=569885" title="Wheatus">
<text>Wheatus is an American rock band from Northport, New York, formed in 1995. They are known principally for their 2000 single, &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot;. They also experienced success with their 2001 cover version of Erasure&#x27;s &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, and their self-titled album was certified platinum in the United Kingdom.

==History==
===1995–2002: Formation and &quot;Wheatus&quot;===
Wheatus was formed by Brendan Bernard Brown in 1995, who plays guitar and sings, on the Lower East Side of New York City. Brown began by writing a few songs and subsequently enlisted the help of his brother Peter on drums, Rich Liegey on bass and backing vocals, and Philip A. Jimenez on various percussion instruments, keyboards, harmonica, samples, and special effects. The band derives its name from the nickname &quot;wedus&quot; given to the Brown brothers by their father when they were children. In 1999, they hired New York entertainment executive and producer Ray Maiello, who booked them at New York&#x27;s Luna Lounge for regular appearances. Maiello distributed the group&#x27;s self-produced debut album to major record labels, including A&amp;R executive Kevin Patrick from Columbia Records. Maiello then arranged for Patrick to see the band play at the Mercury Lounge, and Patrick subsequently signed Wheatus to a multi-album deal, with Maiello as the band&#x27;s manager. Their self-titled debut album was released on August 15, 2000, and spawned their first and largest hit, &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot;, a song that charted at No. 1 in Australia and No. 2 in the United Kingdom. Their second single, a cover of Erasure&#x27;s &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, peaked at No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. The third single from the album, a double A-side of &quot;Leroy&quot; and &quot;Wannabe Gangstar&quot;, was less successful, only reaching No. 23 on the UK Singles Chart. Another song from the album, &quot;Punk Ass Bitch&quot;, was bought by the creators of &quot;Jackie Chan Adventures&quot; and reworked as &quot;Chan&#x27;s the Man&quot;, the end credits theme for the program&#x27;s first season.

===2002–2005: &quot;Hand Over Your Loved Ones&quot; and &quot;Suck Fony&quot;===
Wheatus began work on their second album in 2002, with Brendan enlisting the help of his sister, Liz Brown, and the band&#x27;s merchandiser, Kathryn Froggatt, as backing vocalists. Shannon Harris of Relish, a group who had supported Wheatus on their earlier tours, was also added to the band as keyboardist. When the album, &quot;Hand Over Your Loved Ones&quot;, was released in 2003, it received little promotion in the UK and was not issued in the US. In October 2004, the band made the decision to part with their record label and to form their own, Montauk Mantis. During this time, they also enlisted Michael Bellar as a replacement for Harris. In February 2005, Wheatus re-released &quot;Hand Over Your Loved Ones&quot; under the new title &quot;Suck Fony&quot;. It included the new tracks &quot;William McGovern&quot; and a cover of Pat Benatar&#x27;s &quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot;.

===2005–2007: Lineup changes and &quot;Too Soon Monsoon&quot;===
Bassist Mike McCabe left the band in March 2005, shortly after the release of &quot;Suck Fony&quot;; he was replaced by Nicolas diPierro. The band subsequently began recording a new album in April 2005, and three months later, the first single, &quot;BMX Bandits&quot;, was released. In October 2005, the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Too Soon Monsoon&quot;, was issued. Since early 2010, it has been made available via a &quot;pay what you want&quot; donation scheme via the band&#x27;s official website. Days after the release, Michael Bellar decided to leave the band and was replaced by Gerard Hoffmann. A second single, &quot;The London Sun&quot;, was released in February 2006. diPierro departed the band and was replaced by 19-year-old rookie bassist Matt Milligan. A further lineup change occurred in May 2006, when drummer Pete Brown decided to give up being a musician to get married. He was replaced by Kevin Garcia, leaving Brendan Brown as the only remaining member from the original lineup. The next member change occurred only five days later, when Kathryn Froggatt left the band due to pregnancy. She was replaced by Connie Renda, who in turn traded places with Missy Heselton. In February 2007, Wheatus joined the UK leg of the Get Happy Tour, along with founders Bowling for Soup and Army of Freshmen and British pop-punk outfit Son of Dork, for a sold-out 13-show tour. Liz Brown and Missy Heselton both left the group around this time.

===2008–2012: &quot;Pop, Songs &amp; Death&quot;===
Wheatus began recording new material in October 2007. Its release was carried over until February 2008, when a video for the song &quot;Real Girl&quot; was uploaded to YouTube. In March, the band performed several shows in the US and also announced dates for an acoustic performance in the UK, In October, they completed a tour of the UK, during which some of the new material was showcased in acoustic form. In November, the band returned to the recording studio and set a release date for a six-track EP, entitled &quot;Pop, Songs &amp; Death, Vol 1: The Lightning EP&quot;. In early 2009, Brown composed music for &quot;April Showers&quot;, a film that deals with the Columbine High School massacre. On June 1, 2009, &quot;The Lightning EP&quot; was expected for release; however, it was not available until June 2 due to a series of technical difficulties, including a server crash on the band&#x27;s website. In January 2010, Wheatus began a worldwide theater tour, with dates spanning the US, UK, and Austria. They were supported by nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot. In April 2010, Brown announced via his Twitter page that &quot;Pop, Songs &amp; Death, Vol. 2: The Jupiter EP&quot; was scheduled for release in May 2010. However, this was pushed back to December 23, 2010.

In November 2012, the EPs were released together as the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Pop, Songs and Death&quot;.

===2012–2014: &quot;The Valentine LP&quot;===
Following a re-release of the single &quot;Lemonade&quot;, supported by the first of three Lego videos created by Oliver Broadbent, Wheatus released their fifth studio album, &quot;The Valentine LP&quot;, in 2013. Brown described it as a set of &quot;post-apocalyptic love songs&quot;, adding that he delved into the concept of &quot;reconstituting society, fighting zombies, and trying to maintain some kind of romantic relationship at the same time&quot;.

An album sampler was released on YouTube on July 27, 2013, while full tracks from the record were uploaded between August 14 and September 9. &quot;The Valentine LP&quot; was released on August 2, 2013, through the band&#x27;s website, with a vinyl version shipping in late 2013. The digital version of the album includes a PDF entitled &quot;Valentine Comic&quot;, with concept art depicting a zombie apocalypse love story, designed by graphic artist Ecol (Eric Collins). In September and October 2013, the band toured the UK. Prior to the tour, long-term drummer Kevin Garcia left and was replaced by William Tully.

Following the album&#x27;s release, Wheatus recorded a new single, &quot;Only You&quot;, a collaboration with two members of One Direction&#x27;s band, bassist Sandy Beales and drummer Josh Devine. The single was released on July 6, 2014. The collaboration came about as a result of One Direction covering &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; on their &quot;Where We Are Tour&quot;. &quot;The Valentine LP&quot; was released on CD through Blacktop Records in the UK in 2014, with three bonus tracks: &quot;Only You&quot;, a single mix of &quot;Holiday&quot;, and an acoustic version of &quot;Only You&quot;.

===2014–present: Sixth studio album, classic lineup reunion===
Since 2014, Wheatus has been in the process of recording a sixth studio album. Tentatively titled &quot;Beasts of the Unknown&quot;, Brown has stated that the direction of the record will be &quot;80&#x27;s metal&quot;, inspired by the bands that he grew up listening to as a teenager. The first track from the album, &quot;Zelda&quot;, first appeared in the band&#x27;s live setlist in late 2014. Recording was due to take place in late 2015, until plans for a tour celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of their debut album were announced. During this time, drummer William Tully left and was replaced by Leo Freire. Joey Slater also replaced Karlie Bruce after she left for a second time. Wheatus then toured with Busted on their &quot;Pigs Can Fly&quot; arena tour.

In late 2016, Brown stated in an interview, &quot;Album [seven] is almost ready to be recorded, and we&#x27;ll be working on that over the winter and hope to have that done by 2017&quot;. He also mentioned that twenty songs had been written for the release, and the band were aiming to record them all before the start of the year. &quot;Tipsy&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on December 22, 2016. After announcing a further UK tour for April and May 2017, Brown stated that recording had once again halted. During this time, keyboardist Mark Palmer left the band, with Brandon Ticer brought in as his replacement. Karlie Bruce returned on backing vocals after a three-year absence, joining Gabrielle Sterbenz and Joey Slater. On June 8, 2018, &quot;Lullaby&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. A further new song, &quot;Michelle&quot;, was first performed live in September 2018.

In November 2018, Wheatus returned to the UK to tour as a support act for A. In early 2019, the band provided direct support to Mike Doughty on the first leg of his twenty-fifth anniversary tour of Soul Coughing&#x27;s &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot;, their first full US tour in many years. For these shows, Leo Freire was replaced by drummer Madden Klass. Brown, Milligan, and Klass also sat in as members of Doughty&#x27;s band for the duration of the tour.

In early 2019, Wheatus announced plans for their first world tour since 2000, playing in the US and South Africa as well as 48 dates across Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. On April 5, 2019, they played a special show at the Mercury Lounge in New York, which featured two sets: one with the current lineup and one from the &quot;classic&quot; lineup, with Peter Brown, Mike McCabe, Phil Jimenez, Liz Brown, Kathryn Froggatt performing together for the first time since 2003. During the Welsh dates of the band&#x27;s world tour, Brown expressed support for Scottish and Welsh independence from the UK, showing up at a &quot;Yes&quot; rally march.

As well as continuing to record their sixth album, Brown has stated that the band are in the midst of preparing a 20th-anniversary expanded-edition of their self-titled debut album, due out in 2020 alongside a 20th-anniversary tour.

Brown was featured on the title track of the Math the Band album &quot;Flange Factory Five&quot;, released on October 2, 2020.

In October 2023, Wheatus returned to Sony to release a five-track EP titled &quot;Just a Dirtbag Christmas&quot;.

In February 2024, Brown played guitar on the Late Cambrian single &quot;Late Bloomer.&quot;

<text>was a medieval Japanese blacksmith widely acclaimed as Japan&#x27;s greatest swordsmith. He created swords and daggers, known in Japanese as &quot;tachi&quot; and &quot;tantō&quot;, in the &quot;Sōshū&quot; school. However, many of his forged &quot;tachi&quot; were made into &quot;katana&quot; by cutting the tang (&quot;nakago&quot;) in later times (&quot;suriage&quot;). For this reason, his only existing works are &quot;katana&quot;, &quot;tantō&quot;, and &quot;wakizashi&quot;. No exact dates are known for Masamune&#x27;s life. It is generally agreed that he made most of his swords between 1288 and 1328. Some stories list his family name as Okazaki, but some experts believe this is a fabrication to enhance the standing of the Tokugawa family.

Masamune is believed to have worked in Sagami Province during the last part of the Kamakura period (1288–1328), and it is thought that he was trained by swordsmiths from Bizen and Yamashiro provinces, such as Saburo Kunimune, Awataguchi Kunitsuna and Shintōgo Kunimitsu. He was the father of Hikoshiro Sadamune, also a famous Sōshū master.

An award for swordsmiths called the Masamune Prize is awarded at the Japanese Sword Making Competition. Although not awarded every year, it is presented to a swordsmith who has created an exceptional work.

== Style ==

The swords of Masamune possess a reputation for superior beauty and quality, remarkable in a period where the steel necessary for swords was often impure. He is considered to have brought to perfection the art of .

Masamune studied under Shintōgo Kunimitsu and made blades in &quot;suguha&quot; (straight temper line), but he made &quot;notare hamon&quot;, where the finish on the leading edge of blade slowly undulates where it was quenched. There are also some blades with &quot;ko-midare&quot; (small irregularities), a style which appears to have been copied from the Old Bizen and Hōki Province styles. His works are well-characterized by striking &quot;chikei&quot; (dark lines following the grain pattern in the steel above the hamon), &quot;kinsuji&quot; (lightning shaped lines of nie), and &quot;nie&quot; (crystals of martensite embedded in a pearlite matrix).

Swords created by Masamune often are referred to with the smith&#x27;s name (as with other pieces of artwork) and often with a name for the individual sword as well. The &quot;Honjo Masamune&quot;, a symbol of the Tokugawa shogunate and passed down from shōgun to shōgun, is perhaps the best known Masamune sword.

Signed works of Masamune are rare. The examples &quot;Fudo Masamune&quot;, &quot;Kyōgoku Masamune&quot;, and &quot;Daikoku Masamune&quot; are accepted as his genuine works. Judging from his style, he was active from the late Kamakura period to the Nanboku-chō period.

His swords are the most frequently cited among those listed in the &quot;Kyōho Meibutsu Cho&quot;, a catalogue of excellent swords in the collections of daimyō edited during the Kyōhō era by the Hon&#x27;ami family of sword appraisers and polishers. The catalogue was created on the orders of the Tokugawa Yoshimune of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1714 and consists of three books. The first book, known as the &quot;Nihon Sansaku&quot;, is a list of the three greatest swordsmiths in the eyes of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, including Etchu Matsukura Go Umanosuke Yoshihiro, Awataguchi Toshiro Yoshimitsu, and lists forty-one blades by Masamune. The three books together list sixty-one blades by Masamune. There are far more blades listed for Masamune than the next two swordsmiths combined. It is known that Hideyoshi had a passion for Soshu swordsmiths which may explain this. A third of all swords listed are Soshu blades by many of the greatest Soshu masters, including Masamune&#x27;s students.

==Legends of Masamune and Muramasa==
A legend tells of a test where Muramasa challenged his master, Masamune, to see who could make a finer sword. They both worked tirelessly, and when both swords were finished, they decided to test the results. The contest was for each to suspend the blades in a small creek with the cutting edge facing against the current. Muramasa&#x27;s sword cut everything that passed its way; fish, leaves floating down the river, the very air which blew on it. Highly impressed with his pupil&#x27;s work, Masamune lowered his sword into the current and waited patiently. Only leaves were cut. However, the fish swam right up to it, and the air hissed as it gently blew by the blade. After a while, Muramasa began to scoff at his master for his apparent lack of skill in the making of his sword. Smiling to himself, Masamune pulled up his sword, dried it, and sheathed it. All the while, Muramasa was heckling him for his sword&#x27;s inability to cut anything. A monk, who had been watching the whole ordeal, walked over and bowed low to the two swordmasters. He then began to explain what he had seen.

In another account of the story, both blades cut the leaves that went down on the river&#x27;s current equally well, but the leaves would stick to the blade of Muramasa whereas they would slip on past Masamune&#x27;s after being sliced. Alternatively, both leaves were cut, but those cut by Masamune&#x27;s blade would reform as it traveled down the stream. Yet another version has leaves being sliced by Muramasa&#x27;s blade while the leaves were repelled by Masamune&#x27;s, and another again has leaves being sliced by Muramasa&#x27;s blade and healed by Masamune&#x27;s.

In yet another story Muramasa and Masamune were summoned to make swords for the &quot;shōgun&quot; or emperor, and the finished swords were held in a waterfall. The result is the same as the other stories, and Masamune&#x27;s swords are deemed holy swords. In one version of the story, Muramasa is killed for creating evil swords.

While all known legends of the two ever having met are historically impossible, both smiths are widely regarded as symbols for their respective eras.

== Students ==

Masamune is believed to have trained a great number of sword smiths; 15 are known, 10 of whom are considered to be the &quot;Juttetsu&quot; or &quot;Ten Famous Students&quot; or &quot;10 Great Disciples of Masamune&quot;.

=== Great Juttetsu ===

==== Chogi ====
(備州長船住長義作—Bishu Osafune Ju Nagayoshi Saku) (備州國長船住長義—Bizen Kuni Osafune Ju Nagayoshi)
Although probably not a direct student of Masamune because of the dates when he was forging, his works are greatly influenced by Masamune&#x27;s work and the Soshu tradition as well as the work of the Soden Bizen swordsmiths. Though the kanji characters are pronounced in Japanese as &#x27;Nagayoshi&#x27;, by convention the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; (Sino-Japanese reading) pronunciation of &#x27;Chogi&#x27; is used for this smith and a handful of others (less commonly for his student Kanenaga, pronounced in &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; as &#x27;Kencho&#x27;).

==== Kanemitsu ====
(備前國長船住兼光—Bizen Kuni Osafune Ju Kanemitsu) (備前長船住兼光—Bishu Osafune ju Kanemitsu) (備前國長船住左衛門尉藤原兼光—Bizen no Kuni Osafune ju Saemonjo Fujiwara Kanemitsu)
Considered to have created some of the sharpest swords ever known, he is one of a handful of smiths rated at &quot;Sai-jo O-wazamono&quot; (grandmaster of great sharpness) with famous swords named &quot;Kabutowari&quot; (Helmet Cutter), &quot;Ishikiri&quot; (Stone Cutter), and &quot;Teppokiri&quot; (Gun Cutter) as relayed in Fujishiro&#x27;s writings. Kanemitsu produced swords used by renowned men and generals. He likely was not taught directly by Masamune, however, but was influenced by the Soshu, crafting swords in addition to serving himself as a leader in the Soden Bizen revolution.

==== Shizu Saburo Kaneuji ====
(兼氏—Kaneuji)
Lived in Yamato province before going to Mino to study under Masamune where his style radically changed. His swords are most like those of Masamune and quite often confused with his. The Mishina school can trace its history back to Kaneuji and Masamune.

==== Kinju ====
(金重) 
Kinju, like Chogi, by convention is pronounced in &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;. He is also known as Kaneshige using the Japanese pronunciation of his name. He and Kaneuji are founders of the Mino style. He was a monk at the Seisen-ji in Tsuruga and led to the creation of Echizen swordmaking like Kuniyuki, moving to Mino around the time of Ryakuo (1338–1342) creating the Seki tradition.

==== Kunishige ====
(長谷部国重—Hasebe Kunishige)
Created the Hasebe school producing swords in the style of the second period of Soshu and Yamashiro. His swords are considered by some to be equal to Akihiro and Hiromitsu. He created the &quot;Heshikiri Hasebe&quot; (The Forceful Cutter) listed in the Kyoho Meibutsu Cho, owned by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and then by Oda Nobunaga. It bears a gold appraisal inlay of Honami Kotoku called a Kinzogan (金象嵌). Today the sword is a family heirloom of the Kuroda Daimyō Ke. The sword takes its name from the story of Oda Nobunaga drawing it to cut through a table to kill Kannai, a tea master who betrayed him.

==== Kunitsugu ====
(来源国次—Rai Minamoto Kunitsugu)
Also goes by the name Kamakura Rai as he is the grandson of Rai Kuniyuki. The influence of the Soshu and Yamashiro traditions can be observed in his works.

==== Saemonzaburo ====
(左—Sa) (筑州左—Chikushu Sa) (筑前國住左—Chikuzen no Kuni ju Sa)
Believed to go by the name Yasuyoshi but signed his work using the first two letters of his given name. Considered by some to be one of the greatest of Masamune&#x27;s students. As well as being a Soshu swordsmith he also created the Chikuzen tradition.

==== Saeki Norishige ====
(則重—Norishige, 佐伯—Saeki)
Historically considered one of the best of Masamune&#x27;s students, he is numbered among the Juttetsu. However, current research indicates that he was a senior student to Masamune, junior to Yukimitsu, under the great teacher Shintōgo Kunimitsu. He, like Go, hailed from Etchu province and is well known as the only smith to have mastered the style of matsukawa-hada (pine tree bark pattern steel), making his work unique.

==== Go Yoshihiro ====
(郷(江)—Go, 義弘—Yoshihiro)
Very few works exist by this swordsmith because of his death at age 27. No known signed works exist. He is believed to have gone by the name of Go Yoshihiro or simply Go, the name of the town from which he came. As well as being a Soshu swordsmith he is a member of the Etchu tradition. He is considered to have the highest skill in forging swords among the Masamune Juttetsu .

==== Naotsuna ====
(石州出羽直綱作—Sekishu Izuwa Naotsuna Saku) (直綱作—Naotsuna Saku)
Many theories exist that he may in fact have been a student of Saemonzaburo among others. His work is considered by many to have been influenced by Soshu(相州) even if not taught by Masamune directly, he is also influenced by the Soden Bizen(備前) and Iwami province (石州) style.

=== Other students ===

* Hiromitsu (相模國住人廣光—Sagami Kuni Junin Hiromitsu): Along with Akihiro brought about the second period of the Soshu style.
* Hikoshiro Sadamune: A student and the son or adopted son of Masamune. Like his father he left no signed work but is considered peerless in the Soshu tradition after Masamune. Sadamune was slightly less skilled than his great father.
* Akihiro (相州住秋廣—Soshu Ju Akihiro) (相模國住人秋廣—Sagami Kuni Junin Akihiro): A direct student of Masamune, along with Hiromitsu was responsible for refining the Soshu style to create the Soshu second period.

==Swords==
Many of his forged &quot;tachi&quot; were later made into &quot;katana&quot; by cutting the tang (&quot;nakago&quot;). For this reason, his only existing works are &quot;katana&quot;, &quot;tantō&quot;, and &quot;wakizashi&quot;. Thus, cutting the tang of an old &quot;tachi&quot; and making it into a &quot;katana&quot; according to the popularity of the &quot;katana&quot; was called &quot;suriage&quot;, which was common in Japanese history. Of the existing Masamune swords, four &quot;katana&quot; and five &quot;tantō&quot; are designated as National Treasures, while six &quot;katana&quot;, three &quot;tantō&quot;, and one &quot;wakizashi&quot; are designated as Important Cultural Properties. Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties, the basis for the current designation of cultural properties as National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties, was enacted in 1950, so the Honjō Masamune, which was a National Treasure under the old system and whose whereabouts were unknown before that time, is not included in the number of National Treasures.

===Honjō Masamune===
The &quot;Honjō Masamune&quot; represented the Tokugawa shogunate during most of the Edo period and was passed down from one &quot;shōgun&quot; to another. It is one of the best known of the swords created by Masamune and is believed to be among the finest Japanese swords ever made. It was made a Japanese National Treasure (&quot;Kokuhō&quot;) in 1939.

The name Honjō probably came about by the sword&#x27;s connection to General Honjō Shigenaga (1540–1614) who gained the sword after a battle in 1561. Shigenaga was attacked by Umanosuke who already possessed a number of trophy heads. Umanosuke struck Shigenaga with the Honjō Masamune which split his helmet, but he survived and took the sword as a prize. The blade had a number of chips from the great battle but was still usable. It was kept by Shigenaga until he was sent to Fushimi Castle around 1592.

Shigenaga was later forced to sell the sword to Toyotomi Hidetsugu, Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s nephew and retainer. It was bought for 13 Mai, 13 ōban, which was 13 large gold coins. The blade was later valued in the Kyoho Meibutsu Cho at 1,000 Mai. It then went to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Shimazu Yoshihiro, again to Hideyoshi, Tokugawa Ieyasu, Tokugawa Yorinobu, and finally Tokugawa Ietsuna. It remained in the Kii (紀伊) branch of the Tokugawa family, and this ownership continued after the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate (1868). The last known owner was Tokugawa Iemasa at the end of World War II.

Under the United States occupation at the end of World War II, all production of nihontō with edges was banned except under police or government permit. The Americans required that all swords be surrendered to the Foreign Liquidation Commission. Tokugawa Iemasa turned in the Honjō Masamune and 13 other &quot;prized heirloom&quot; swords to a police station at Mejiro in December 1945.

In January 1946, the Mejiro police gave the swords to a man identified as &quot;Sgt. Coldy Bimore&quot; (possibly a garbled phonetic spelling of the man&#x27;s name) of the Foreign Liquidations Commission of AFWESPAC (Army Forces, Western Pacific). In an episode of &quot;Expedition Unknown&quot;, Josh Gates traveled to Japan in search of the Honjō Masamune and learned that there were no records of a &quot;Sgt. Coldy Bimore&quot; listed to have received the sword. The Honjō Masamune is the most important of the missing Japanese swords, and its current location remains unknown. Only vague theories exist as to the location of the sword.

===Fudo Masamune===
This is one of the few blades signed by Masamune that is not in question as to the signature. It is designated as an Important Cultural Property. It was bought by Toyotomi Hidetsugu in 1601 for 500 Kan and was passed to Shōgun Ieyasu and from him to Maeda Toshiie. Maeda Toshitsune presented it again to the shōgun, possibly on his retirement. Later, the sword was handed down among the Owari Tokugawa. This blade is a tantō (dagger) approximately 25 cm (8 sun 6.5 bun) with a carving of roots on the &quot;omote&quot; (front, outer edge) side. It also has chopstick-like grooves (g&quot;omabashi&quot; 護摩箸) on the back and a dragon at the &quot;ura&quot; part of blade (&quot;kurikara&quot; 倶利伽羅). The blade features an engraving of Fudō Myō-ō, the Buddhist deity which gives this blade its name.

The Fudo Masamune is one of the few surviving blades that is known for sure to have been made and signed by the swordsmith and from the early 1600s, it was in the possession of the Owari branch of the Tokugawa clan. It is a made primarily for stabbing but with a sharp edge allowing it to be useful for slashing also.

===Musashi Masamune===
A peculiar work of Masamune, once in the possession of the Tokugawa Shogunate through the Kii Domain and gifted to the main Tokugawa family line in Edo in its prime. It is designated as an Important Art Object. Upon the end of the Tokugawa Era marked by the Bakumatsu, the Musashi Masamune was presented as a gift by Tokugawa Iesato in honor of Yamaoka Tesshū&#x27;s efforts to facilitate peaceful negotiation with Katsu Kaishū to Saigō Takamori, sparing Edo from war and needless destruction; however, Yamaoka was humbled upon being given such a masterpiece, and had passed it down to statesman Iwakura Tomomi. Soon after seeing it passed from hand to hand throughout the 20th Century, the Musashi Masamune finally made its way to the Nihon Bijutsu Token Hozon Kyokai in the year 2000 by Motoo Otsuyasu. The Musashi Masamune is a tachi, measuring 74 cm (2 korai-shaku, 1 sun, 4.2 bun) and noted to have nearly all of the characteristics of Masamune&#x27;s signature features; though it is debated that its &quot;o-kissaki&quot; is not that of his style, it is compared to blades made in his later career, which shows the transition of the Kamakura styles into the Nanbokucho era. It is rumored that, while the blade is named after Musashi Province, where Edo and current day Tokyo stands, its origin stems from being once in the possession of Miyamoto Musashi, who is considered Japan&#x27;s most famous swordsman. The sword is classified as a &quot;meibutsu&quot;.

In 2000, this sword was acquired by the Society for the Preservation of Japanese Art Swords with the assistance of Motoo Otsuyasu.


===Hōchō Masamune===
The &quot;Hōchō&quot; Masamune refers to any one of three particular and unusual &quot;tantō&quot; attributed to Masamune. These &quot;tantō&quot; have a wide body, unlike his normal slim and elegant work, making them appear quite similar to a Japanese cooking knife. One of the three blades has a &quot;gomabashi&quot; in cutout (&quot;sukashi&quot;). It was restored around 1919 and sold for approximately 10 &quot;hiki&quot; (a certain number of &quot;mon&quot;); this was worth roughly 14¢ US at the time, meaning that the price was remarkably low.

All three have been displayed within the Tokugawa Art Museum. All three have been designated National Treasures.

===Kotegiri Masamune===
Kotegiri means &quot;Kote cutter&quot;. In this case &quot;kote&quot; is a contraction of &quot;yugote&quot; (弓籠手), an archer&#x27;s arm-guard. This name comes from when Asakura Ujikage cut an opposing samurai&#x27;s &quot;yugote&quot; in the battle of Toji in Kyôto. Oda Nobunaga gained possession of this sword and had it shortened to its present length. In 1615, it passed down to the Maeda clan who in 1882 presented it as a gift to Emperor Meiji, a known sword collector.

===Masamune in Harry S. Truman Library===
A Masamune was given to President Harry S. Truman shortly after World War II. It is kept in the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum.

<text>Aviogenex () was a Serbian and Yugoslav charter airline based at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. It operated regular and ad hoc charter flights as well as wet-lease services.

==History==
Aviogenex had more than 40 years of experience in flying under charter, sub charter and wet lease agreements. Aviogenex was founded on 21 May 1968 as an air transport division of Generalexport, an enterprise for foreign and domestic trade, tourism and air transport. On 30 April 1969, Aviogenex operated its first flight from Belgrade to Düsseldorf Airport using a Tupolev Tu-134. Prior to the break-up of Yugoslavia, Aviogenex was the busiest charter airline in the country, handling over half a million passengers per year in the late 1980s. Aviogenex brought their first two Boeing 727-200 from Yugoslav Air Force in 1983.

The last Tu-134&#x27;s in the fleet were retired in the early 90s. 

In 1990, the airline flew 633,932 passengers, with 10 aircraft (5 Boeing 727 and 5 Boeing 737) reaching 17,000 flight hours per year. Since 1991, Aviogenex has oriented to leasing of aircraft and crews, and achieved more than 40,000 flight hours. In this period Aviogenex operated in Europe, Africa, the Middle and Far East, and South America. In 2010, they restarted flights under their own name using a Boeing 737-200 Advanced.

In February 2015, it was announced that Aviogenex will cease operations to be liquidated as the government failed to attract investors for the airline.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 23 May 1971, an Aviogenex Tupolev Tu-134A (tail number YU-AHZ) crashed on approach to Rijeka Airport located on the island of Krk, because of rough landing in bad weather conditions, killing 78 people and leaving five survivors.

The aircraft was used for rejected takeoff training, with four rejected takeoffs in 12 minutes (in the conditions at the time at Kaduna, a single exercise of a rejected take off would have required a cooling period of at least ten minutes). A wheel caught fire due to overheating, and the aircraft burned completely. There were no fatalities.

<text>BBC Radio York is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of North Yorkshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios in the Bootham area of York.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 60,000 listeners and a 4.6% share as of December 2023.

==History==
In May 1982, just over a year before the station was due to launch, a temporary service was provided to cover Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to York. The service, which ran for just over 24 hours, operated on what was to be the station&#x27;s primary medium wave frequency and was also broadcast on the other local stations in the Yorkshire region.

The station was launched at 6:30 am on 4 July 1983, and featured on the cover of the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. John Jefferson was the first station manager with the late Tony Fish as Programme Organiser. The original team included David Farwig, Derm Tanner, Andy Joynson, David Thomas, Will Hanrahan, Graham Pass, Nik Wood (Scarborough Producer), Diane Myers (Harrogate Producer), Andy Hitchcock, Chris Loveder, Chris Choi, Charlotte Counsel, Shirley Lewis and Sandy Barton.

Initially, the station was only on air for a few hours a day (6:30 am to 1 pm and 4 pm to 6 pm during the week with weekend programming restricted to 8 am until 2 pm) and carried BBC Radio 2 the rest of the time although during the football and rugby league seasons, the station simulcasted BBC Radio Leeds, whose output also featured matches played by the senior North Yorkshire clubs. Later in the decade, the station started to produce its own sports programming as broadcast hours slowly expanded. Weekday afternoon broadcasting was introduced in autumn 1984 and programming also began to start earlier in the day and by the time regional evening programme was introduced by the end of the decade, the station was producing its own programming all day from 6am on weekdays and from 7am at the weekend.

Evening programming on BBC Radio York has always been of a regional nature. The very first was a Saturday evening 45-minute programme consisting of organ music which aired during the winter sports period at 6:45 pm on BBC Radios Leeds, York and Humberside. Then in August 1986 Radio York joined with the other BBC local stations in Yorkshire in broadcasting an early evening service of specialist music programmes. This was expanded on 29 May 1989 with the launch of the BBC Night Network – an all-evening networked service which broadcast nightly on all six Yorkshire and north-east stations from 6.05 pm (6 pm at the weekend) until midnight. In May 1991, local programming was expanded by an hour, until 7 pm. This co-insided with the &quot;Night Network&quot;s expansion to include the BBC&#x27;s north-west stations and the following year, Night Network programming was extended on weeknights until 12:30 am, and to 1 am by the end of that decade. Initially, BBC Radio York did not provide any programming for the network but later on, &quot;Late Night North with David Dunning&quot; often aired from the York studios and in 2002 the BBC&#x27;s Yorkshire stations, including Radio York, parted from the network to bring back a phone-in with Alex Hall, who had presented a similar show on Pulse. Other programming included Martin Kelner&#x27;s Late Thing. &quot;The Early Show&quot; from BBC Radio Humberside (within the BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire region) was also carried.

BBC Radio York was not the first radio station broadcasting in York. University Radio York, the oldest independent legal radio station, is the University of York&#x27;s student radio station and before the BBC, URY was named Radio York. The independent commercial rival, Minster FM, began broadcasting on 4 July 1992. Stray FM, the independent station covering the Harrogate and Ripon areas, made its first transmission exactly two years to the day after Minster&#x27;s launch and eleven years to the day after Radio York&#x27;s launch.

==Technical==
BBC Radio York broadcasts from its studios in York and uses three FM transmitters. The station broadcasts on 95.5 (Oliver&#x27;s Mount, Scarborough), 103.7 (Acklam Wold transmitter near Leavening, midway between York and Malton) and 104.3 FM (Woolmoor, near Upsall four miles north of Thirsk close to the A19 – for Ripon, Harrogate, Northallerton and the Yorkshire Dales).

The 140 ft Acklam Wold transmitter broadcasts the strongest frequency on 103.7 which is for Ryedale and the Vale of York. In the early days, Radio York&#x27;s FM frequencies were 90.2 and 97.2.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 712 in the BBC Yorkshire and BBC North East and Cumbria regions and streams online via BBC Sounds.

Until 24 February 2020, BBC Radio York was also broadcast on medium wave – 666 (Fulford) and 1260 (Row Brow, Scarborough) AM. The transmitters were closed as a cost-cutting measure.

Much of BBC York&#x27;s studio infrastructure was the original Mk3 installation, dating from the station&#x27;s inception in 1983. This ageing equipment had become unreliable, causing the station to &quot;fall off air&quot; regularly. Because the refurbishment required was significant, it would not be possible to continue to broadcast from the existing premises during the refurbishment, and no suitable alternative premises could be identified. Therefore, plans were drawn up for BBC York to move in with BBC Leeds temporarily and to retain a presence in North Yorkshire through the BBC Bus, and through increased contributions from district studios in Harrogate and Scarborough. BBC York has since completed refurbishment of studio equipment and news room.

===DAB licence===
The DAB licence that BBC Radio York uses covers North Yorkshire from transmitters at Acklam Wold, Oliver&#x27;s Mount, Harrogate, Hilderbrand, and Bilsdale. The licence was advertised in June 2007 and was awarded to MuxCo in September 2007. It was supposed be ready in June 2009, then revised to December 2009. Finally, the North Yorkshire DAB multiplex launched on 17 December 2014.

Listeners in Whitby cannot get signals that broadcast BBC Radio York. However, the town is officially served by BBC Radio Tees that broadcasts from its studios in Middlesbrough. 

Areas west of Craven such as Settle, Ingleton and Bentham is officially served by BBC Radio Lancashire. Although editorially, news for those areas is covered by BBC Radio York, but FM reception and DAB isn&#x27;t possible in those areas.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s York studios from 6 am to 10 pm each day. The station&#x27;s Sunday evening output also airs on BBC Radio Humberside and BBC Radio Lincolnshire.

The current weekday daytime presenters are Georgey Spanswick from 6 am to 10 am, Joanita Musisi (Jenkinson) from 10 am to 2 pm. Toby Foster&#x27;s afternoon show is also carried on BBC Radio Leeds and BBC Radio Sheffield.

Off-peak programming, including the regional late show (10 pm to 1 am), originates from BBC Radio Leeds.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio York simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio London.

<doc id="569909" wikidata="Q1928051" url="?curid=569909" title="Michael Johnson (singer)">
<text>Michael Jay Johnson (August 8, 1944 – July 25, 2017) was an American pop, country, and folk singer-songwriter and guitarist. He is best remembered for his 1978 hit song &quot;Bluer Than Blue&quot;. He charted four hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and nine more on Hot Country Songs, including two number one country hits in 1986&#x27;s &quot;Give Me Wings&quot; and &quot;The Moon Is Still Over Her Shoulder&quot;. He also co-wrote &quot;Cain&#x27;s Blood&quot;, the debut single of 1990s country group 4 Runner.

==Career==

Johnson was born in the small town of Alamosa, Colorado and grew up in Denver. He started playing the guitar at 13. In 1963, he began attending Colorado State College (now the University of Northern Colorado) in Greeley to study music but his college career was truncated when he won an international talent contest two years later. First prize included a deal with Epic Records.

Wishing to hone his instrumental skills, in 1966 he set off for Barcelona, Spain, to the Liceu Conservatory, studying with the eminent classical guitarists, Graciano Tarragó and Renata Tarragó. Upon his return to the States, he joined Randy Sparks in a group called the New Society and did a tour of the Orient.

When the band dissolved in 1967, he signed on with the Chad Mitchell Trio for a year, spending some of that time co-writing with another member, John Denver. The group was renamed Denver, Boise &amp; Johnson. When the trio came to an end, Johnson made a radical departure from everything he had done previously by taking on a major supporting role in the off-Broadway production of &quot;Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris.&quot;

In 1971, Johnson signed with Atco Records to record his first album, &quot;There Is A Breeze&quot;, which was released in 1973 and produced by Johnson, Chris Dedrick, Peter Yarrow and Phil Ramone in New York and Toronto, Canada. Feeling this first effort was not a true reflection of his music (despite being a best seller in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area), Johnson self-produced his next LP in 1975, &quot;For All You Mad Musicians&quot;, relying more on his voice and guitar for a folk feel. He followed this up with &quot;Ain&#x27;t Dis Da Life&quot;, where he added a rhythm section. With each new recording and his continued touring, his popularity was increasing.

Teaming up with Brent Maher and Steve Gibson in Nashville, Tennessee, Johnson created a two-song demo consisting of &quot;Bluer Than Blue&quot; and &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot; (the latter song from the Broadway musical &quot;Brigadoon&quot;). EMI America took one listen and wasted no time in signing him, quickly getting &quot;The Michael Johnson Album&quot; out in 1978. &quot;Bluer Than Blue&quot; was written by Randy Goodrum. The first single, &quot;Bluer Than Blue&quot;, became Johnson&#x27;s first Top 40 hit, peaking at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the summer of 1978; the song became a chart-topping single on the Adult Contemporary chart. &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot; went to No. 91 on the R&amp;B chart while hitting the Top 5 on the AC chart and the Top 40 on the pop chart. 

Johnson recorded five albums in all for EMI and in 1985 moved over to RCA Records, where he adopted a contemporary country style that stayed compatible with his soft, mellow leanings. He scored five Top Ten country hits from 1986 to 1989, including the chart-toppers &quot;Give Me Wings&quot; and &quot;The Moon Is Still Over Her Shoulder.&quot; After two country albums on RCA (plus two greatest hits collections), Johnson moved over to Atlantic Records in 1991.

In 1995, the country music group 4 Runner scored a minor hit with the single &quot;Cain&#x27;s Blood&quot;, for which Johnson co-wrote an updated version with Jack Sundrud of Poco.

==Death==
Johnson died at his home in Minneapolis, Minnesota on July 25, 2017, two weeks before what would have been his 73rd birthday.

<text>The British Mountaineering Council (BMC) is the national representative body for England and Wales that exists to protect the freedoms and promote the interests of climbers, hill walkers and mountaineers, including ski-mountaineers. The BMC are also recognised by government as the national governing body for competition climbing.

==History==
The organisation was originally formed in 1944, following a proposal from the president of the Alpine Club, Geoffrey Winthrop Young. It aimed to represent the interests of climbing clubs and primarily maintain access for climbers to climb on a mountain, a crag, or even a sea cliff in England and Wales. When the council was created the following aims were set out:

* Protection of climbing areas from planned development.
* Provision of huts and hostels.
* Reviewing and investigating climbing equipment.
* Assisting mountain rescue.
* Provision of climbing and hillwalking instructors.
* Establishing regional committees.
* Publication of a mountaineering journal.

In 1972 as a result of the Cairngorm Plateau disaster where five school children and one teacher died of hypothermia the BMC began working closely with the Mountain Leader Training Board. To this day membership of the BMC or Mountaineering Scotland is required to begin mountain leader training.

In 1997, the BMC was one of the organisations which formed the Mountain Training Trust which took control of managing Plas y Brenin on behalf of Sport England.

As of 2017 its headquarters are on Burton Road in West Didsbury, an area of Manchester, England.

In 2018, members voted for the first female president of the organisation, Lynn Robinson.

===Founding members===
The BMC began with 25 member climbing and outdoor organisations including:
*Alpine Club
*The Rucksack Club
*The Wayfarers&#x27; Club
*Ladies&#x27; Alpine Club
*Pinnacle Club
*The Yorkshire Ramblers&#x27; Club
==Member benefits==
The British Mountaineering Council works for its members to provide services and representation for: access and conservation, climbing walls, clubs and huts, competition climbing, equipment advice, guidebooks and maps, heritage, international, safety and skills, youth and equity. The organisation now has two types of membership; those that are affiliated via a club and those that are individual members.

The BMC currently has over 75,000 members: 51,000 individual members, 24,000 club members, and 280 affiliated clubs. Membership benefits include access to the BMC travel insurance scheme, civil liability insurance, discounts on equipment, technical and training advice, and four copies of &quot;Summit&quot; magazine each year.

&quot;Summit&quot; magazine aims to cover articles of interest to all climbers, hill walkers, and mountaineers. It frequently covers topics outside the remit of the mainstream magazines. Editions of the magazine are produced four times per year (Feb, May, Sep, Nov) and are sent direct to all British Mountaineering Council (BMC) individual members. People who are members of the BMC through an affiliated club only receive one copy – the February issue. The circulation therefore varies from 40,000 (May, Sep, Nov) to 75,000 (Feb). This makes it the climbing magazine with the largest circulation in the UK. It is also available to purchase in the BMC online shop and available from selected mountain centres throughout the UK, such as Plas y Brenin in Capel Curig.

The BMC produces rock climbing guidebooks to parts of the UK, primarily the Peak District and Lancashire. It also administers a &#x27;reciprocal rights card&#x27; service, giving BMC affiliate members reduced rates in alpine huts owned by other national mountaineering organisations.

==Rebranding proposal==
On 25 July 2016 the British Mountaineering Council announced its intention to re-brand itself as &quot;Climb Britain&quot;, following consultant advice funded by Sport England. However, following a strong backlash from its membership and subsequent consultations and heated online debates, it announced two months later that the renaming would not go ahead. Because of the way the rebranding issue had been handled, the BMC executive committee subsequently found itself facing a motion of no confidence from some of its members at its April 2017 AGM.

Interest was expressed in using the &quot;Climb Britain&quot; brand for another purpose within the BMC.

<doc id="569915" wikidata="Q7991982" url="?curid=569915" title="Wheatus (album)">
<text>Wheatus is the debut studio album by American rock band Wheatus, released by Columbia Records on August 15, 2000. Written mostly by guitarist and vocalist Brendan B. Brown, it was recorded in the basement of Brown&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house, and self-produced by the band with the help of multiple mixing engineers and George Marino as mastering engineer.

In July 2000, &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single, and peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Alternative Airplay Chart and number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, an Erasure cover, was released as the second single in July 2001. &quot;Wannabe Gangstar&quot;/&quot;Leroy&quot;, a double A-side single, was released in January 2002 as the final single.

==Background==
Wheatus formed in 1995 after guitarist and vocalist Brendan B. Brown left the skate-pop band Mr. Jones to write his own material. Brown brought in his younger brother, Peter, to play drums and Rich Liegey to play bass. Peter enjoyed the songs Brendan had written. Multi-instrumentalist and engineer Phil A. Jimenez wanted to work with Brown after hearing &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot;. The following week, Jimenez was at band rehearsal, appreciating every song. The energy &quot;of the pop elements&quot; in addition to &quot;the story-telling and the social commentary&quot; made Jimenez feel like he &quot;really wanted to be a part of [the band].&quot;

==Composition==
All of the material on &quot;Wheatus&quot; was written by Brendan B. Brown, except for &quot;Punk Ass Bitch&quot;, which was written by bassist Rich Liegey, and their cover of Erasure&#x27;s &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, which was written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell. The song titles came to Brown first with the subject matter following as he considered the name &quot;an emotional blueprint&quot;. Brown mentioned that the beat in &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; was &quot;sort of a hip-hop thing&quot; and that the guitars &quot;are definitely heavy metal&quot;. Brown had the chorus melody and the &quot;oh yeah&quot; section before finishing the song&#x27;s lyrics, it was &quot;one of those once-in-a-lifetime melodies that works for every reason.&quot; Brown claimed the song was autobiographical, however, none of the band members &quot;wound up getting the girl in the end. So I guess that&#x27;s the inspiration—the hope that that happens to someone someday.&quot;

Talking about &quot;Truffles&quot; and &quot;Wannabe Gangstar&quot;, Brown explained that when you&#x27;re younger &quot;You can&#x27;t do anything [...]. You have no power; you have no resources. You&#x27;re subject to everyone else&#x27;s crap&quot;. &quot;Sunshine&quot;, the first song written for the album, was Brown realizing he was working for the wrong kind of people. &quot;Hump&#x27;Em N&#x27; Dump&#x27;Em&quot; was written when the Senate was thinking of impeaching the president. &quot;Hey, Mr. Brown&quot; was written after Brown was not being paid for something he had done. &quot;Love Is a Mutt from Hell&quot; was about a dysfunctional romance. &quot;Wannabe Gangster&quot; was inspired by &quot;white, middle class glorification of inner city problems&quot;, according to Brown.

==Recording==
Using the knowledge he gained from being in his former band, &quot;Wheatus&quot; was recorded in the basement of Brown&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house. A control room was set up in the dining room, with a one hundred-foot cable leading down to the basement. &quot;Wheatus&quot; was produced and engineered by Wheatus and Philip A. Jimenez. One of the reasons the band self-produced the album was their idea to take specific sounds from different genres and include them into songs. Brown explained that &quot;When you&#x27;re a small band and nothing&#x27;s going on for you, you can&#x27;t explain to somebody bigger than you [...] what you want to do. They just won&#x27;t care.&quot; New York-based band Soul Coughing had a big influence on the production of the album.

Despite the multitude of electric guitar tones, no electric guitars were used in the recording process. The tones originate from Brown&#x27;s acoustic Martin guitar, which is set up through two preamplifiers which are connected to their own power amplifiers. Brown can swap between the preamplifiers with the aid of an expression pedal so that he is able to &quot;swell into a distortion sound while fading out the clean tone&quot;. Brown claimed he does not know &quot;[that] many guitar players&quot;, thus he took three different guitar sounds that he enjoyed and merged them into his sound. Jimenez provided percussion, harmonica and banjo. David Thoener mixed almost all of the tracks apart from &quot;Wannabe Gangstar&quot;, which was mixed by Brown, and &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, which was mixed by Richard A. LaSalvia. The album was mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York.

==Release==
Wheatus was named artist of week at billboardtalentnet.com in February 2000. In March, Wheatus signed to Columbia. Liegey left the band prior to the release of &quot;Wheatus&quot; and was replaced by Mike McCabe in July, who left his job as a flight attendant to join the band. &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; was released as a single on July 18. The music video, directed by Jeff Gordon, was nominated for Best Video at the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Awards. The song was given extra promotion due to its inclusion on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Loser&quot; (2000). According to an issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; dated July 2000 Wheatus was the most-download artist at billboardtalentnet.com. In the same issue, it mentioned that the band&#x27;s debut album was planned to be called &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; and was set for release on August 1. Instead, &quot;Wheatus&quot; was released through Columbia on August 15. In September, the band toured the US.

Wheatus toured the UK in April 2001. &quot;A Little Respect&quot; was released as a single on July 2. The music video, directed by Brendan Malloy, is about how a boyfriend fails to impress his girlfriend until Wheatus stages a private concert for the pair. It features Shawn Hatosy and Brittany Murphy. Wheatus tour the UK again in November and December 2001. A double A-side single of &quot;Wannabe Gangstar&quot; and &quot;Leroy&quot; was released on January 22, 2002. The music video for &quot;Wannabe Gangstar&quot; was directed by Gordon, while the video for &quot;Leroy&quot; was directed by Mark Hartley. A remixed version of &quot;Wannabe Ganstar&quot; featuring Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson was released earlier on January 7. In March, Brown asked Shannon Harris to join the band as a keyboardist. Tired of being a session musician, Harris accepted. Harris moved to New York and lived with Brown. The band toured the UK in June.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number seven on the US Alternative Songs chart. &quot;Wheatus&quot; charted at number 76 in the US and number seven in the UK. In February 2001, the &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; single was certified silver in the UK and in the following month it was certified gold. The album was certified silver in the UK in April 2001. The following month, it was certified gold in the UK. &quot;A Little Respect&quot; peaked at number 3 in the UK. By August, the album had sold one million copies worldwide. &quot;Wannabe Gangstar&quot;/&quot;Leroy&quot; peaked at number 22 in the UK.

In July 2013, the album was certified platinum in the UK, as was the &quot;Teenage Dirtbag&quot; single. The single is also certified three times platinum in Australia. In July 2014, the &quot;A Little Respect&quot; single was certified silver. By August 2015, the album had sold over five million copies worldwide. Discussing the album&#x27;s legacy, Brown revealed that the recognition &quot;did not initially happen in America. At home we were a bit under the radar. Most people at the label didn&#x27;t really understand how we fitted, or didn&#x27;t fit, into what was happening in music at the time.&quot; The band played the album in full in the UK in September and October with support from Mike Doughty and The Hipstones.

<doc id="569916" wikidata="Q11344830" url="?curid=569916" title="Boat racing">
<text>Boat racing is a sport in which boats, or other types of watercraft, race on water. Boat racing powered by oars is recorded as having occurred in ancient Egypt, and it is likely that people have engaged in races involving boats and other water-borne craft for as long as such watercraft have existed.

A regatta is a series of boat races. The term comes from the Venetian language, with &quot;regata&quot; meaning &quot;contest, contention for mastery&quot;(from &quot;regatare&quot; (&quot;compete, haggle, sell at retail&quot;), possibly from &quot;recatare&quot;) and typically describes racing events of rowed or sailed water craft, although some powerboat race series are also called regattas. A regatta often includes social and promotional activities which surround the racing event, and except in the case of boat type (or &quot;class&quot;) championships, is usually named for the town or venue where the event takes place; for example “valley field”.

Although regattas are typically amateur competitions, they are usually formally structured events, with comprehensive rules describing the schedule and procedures of the event. Regattas may be organized as championships for a particular area or boat type, but are often held just for the joy of competition, camaraderie, and general promotion of the sport.

One of the largest and most popular rowing regattas is the Henley Royal Regatta held on the River Thames, England. One of the largest and oldest yachting regattas in the world is Cowes Week, which is held annually by the Royal Yacht Squadron in Cowes, England, and usually attracts over 900 sailing boats. Cowes Week is predated by the Cumberland Cup (1775), Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta (1822) and Port of Plymouth Regatta (1823). North America&#x27;s oldest regatta is the Royal St. John&#x27;s Regatta held on Quidi Vidi Lake in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland every year since 1818.

There exist other traditional and centuries old boat races like Vallam kali of Kerala, India and Dragon Boat Race from China.

<text>BBC Radio Tees is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the Tees Valley, southern parts of County Durham including Hartlepool and Darlington and northern parts of North Yorkshire, including Whitby. It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on Newport Road in Middlesbrough.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 100,000 listeners and a 4.4% share as of December 2023.

==History==

===BBC Radio Teesside===
The station was originally launched as Radio Teesside at 6 p.m. on 31 December 1970 with a local news programme entitled &quot;Teesside Tonight&quot;, presented by George Lambelle.

===BBC Radio Cleveland===
On 1 April 1974, the station became known as Radio Cleveland when the county of Cleveland was formed. The station moved to new studios in 1983. On 1 April 1996, the county of Cleveland was abolished and the boroughs of Stockton-on-Tees, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, and Redcar and Cleveland were returned to County Durham and North Yorkshire. These four boroughs, along with nearby Darlington, now form the governmental sub-region of Tees Valley. Also included in the main coverage area is the Army&#x27;s main garrison at Catterick Garrison, which is also included in the transmission area of Radio York on 104.3 FM.

===BBC Tees===

On Saturday 11 August 2007, the station was renamed BBC Tees. The BBC Tees brand was already associated with its &quot;Where I Live&quot; website and &quot;BBC Bus&quot;, which have both since been discontinued.

===BBC Radio Tees===
On 27 January 2020, the station was renamed BBC Radio Tees. The addition of &quot;radio&quot; to the names of most BBC local radio stations was to avoid confusion with its similarly named TV news regions.

Colin Bunyan is currently the longest-serving presenter at BBC Radio Tees, hosting the Sunday afternoon Vintage Vinyl programme. He has been a presenter for over 47 years.

==Technical==

Before moving to Eston Nab, the signal on 95 FM originally was relatively strong and originated from the 900-foot Bilsdale transmitter on the North York Moors. A relay transmitter covering the town of Whitby broadcasts on 95.8 FM.

The DAB signals come from the Bauer 11B multiplex at Eston Nab (near the A174 road) and Brusselton (near Shildon between the A68 and A6072).

On 10 August 2021, FM transmission was knocked off air indefinitely following a fire at the Bilsdale site. It is feared that the structural integrity of the transmitter mast may have been compromised. As at 11 August 2021, the 95 FM service is available again, using the Eston Nab transmitter, but it does not reach all areas of the station&#x27;s transmission area. A temporary transmitter on 104.0 FM has also been instated for Darlington and the surrounding areas.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 714 in the BBC North East and Cumbria region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

The station was also broadcast on medium wave until 1992.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Middlesbrough studios from 6 am to 10 pm each day.

From 10 pm each night, BBC Radio Tees carries the England-wide late show and from 1 am, it simulcasts BBC Radio 5 Live.

<text>Hand Over Your Loved Ones (re-released as Suck Fony) is the second studio album released by American rock band Wheatus.

==Background==
&quot;Hand Over Your Loved Ones&quot;, according to frontman Brendan B. Brown, is &quot;a really glossy pop record that had a lot of radio friendly singles on it.&quot;

==Release==
The album was released on 8 September 2003 by Columbia Records. Due to conflicts between the band and their record label, the album was poorly promoted, failed to sell well and only one single, &quot;American In Amsterdam&quot;, was released from it. Free from their contract with Sony, Wheatus released five songs from the album on iTunes as &quot;The Lemonade EP&quot; in 2004.

The album was re-released on 14 February 2005 under the name &quot;Suck Fony&quot;, on the band&#x27;s own record label Montauk Mantis Productions, after they decided to leave Sony BMG. The re-released version includes two new tracks, including the original composition &quot;William McGovern&quot;, and the Pat Benatar cover &quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot;. The album is currently available directly from the band&#x27;s official website for $10, and is available to download in various formats using a &#x27;pay what you want&#x27; donation system where the customer can donate any amount to purchase the album. The album&#x27;s title is a spoonerism of the phrase &quot;Fuck Sony&quot;. A T-shirt was available for a period of time from the band&#x27;s website with the album logo on the front.

<text>BBC Radio Cumbria is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Cumbria.

It broadcasts on FM, AM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios in Carlisle.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 85,000 listeners and a 8.4% share as of December 2023.

==History==
The county of Cumbria, from which the station takes its current name, was not created until 1974. Radio Cumbria began service on 24 November 1973 as BBC Radio Carlisle and could be received across most of the former county of Cumberland.

The station adopted its current name shortly before its tenth anniversary in May 1982, when its service was expanded to cover the whole of the administrative county of Cumbria, namely:
* The former counties of Cumberland and Westmorland
* The former exclave of Lancashire &quot;North of the Sands&quot;
* The small area of the former West Riding of Yorkshire, around Sedbergh and Dent, that had been moved from Yorkshire into Cumbria.

==BBC Radio Furness opt-out==
From the launch of the renamed station, between 25 May 1982 and 1991, an opt-out service, BBC Radio Furness operated in the south of the county at peak times – originally breakfast and lunchtimes on weekdays, and Saturday mornings. Programmes were produced in Barrow-in-Furness and used 96.1 MHz and 837 kHz. This meant that, in addition to the Furness area, Radio Furness could be received along the south coast of Cumbria, in parts of the Lake District, and the west coast as far as Millom.

&quot;Radio Furness&quot; lost its separate branding in 1991 but breakfast and afternoon opt-outs for the South Lakes and Furness continued until 1994. As a result of BBC cutbacks in the 1990s, programme opt-outs were curtailed, although the Barrow studios remained staffed. The former studio in Hartington Street is now the local headquarters for the Labour Party.

==Background==
Radio Cumbria claims to be listened to by one-third of the county&#x27;s population, despite having to face the challenge of an area that is sparsely populated and predominantly rural, with the biggest urban areas around its perimeter. Most programming has a similar format to that of other BBC local radio stations, although one unique feature is the seasonal &quot;Lamb Bank&quot; – a short daily segment which carries announcements from farmers wishing to exchange livestock.

==Technical==
On FM, Radio Cumbria broadcasts to northern Cumbria on 95.6 MHz (Sandale) – suitable for drivers on the M6 north of Penrith – and to the south of the county on 96.1 MHz (Morecambe Bay), with lower-powered relays on 95.2 MHz (Kendal), 104.1 MHz (Whitehaven) and 104.2 MHz (Windermere).

On medium wave, the station broadcasts on 756 kHz (Brisco – Carlisle) and 837 kHz (Barrow-in-Furness). Until 2020, it was also broadcast on 1458 kHz (Whitehaven).

The station also broadcasts on DAB+. DAB+ transmissions began for the station on 1 December 2021, which was the day that the Cumbria multiplex was switched on. Until then, BBC Radio Cumbria had been the only BBC local radio station that wasn&#x27;t broadcasting on DAB.

The station is also available on Freeview TV channel 713 in the BBC North East and Cumbria and BBC North West regions and streams online via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==

Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Carlisle studios from 6 am to 2 pm weekdays and for sports coverage in the evenings. The Saturday Breakfast show also broadcasts locally.

From 10 pm each night, BBC Radio Cumbria carries the England-wide late show; from 1 am, it simulcasts BBC Radio 5 Live. Previously, the station&#x27;s late show had originated from BBC Radio Lancashire on Monday to Thursday nights and BBC Radio Newcastle on Friday to Sunday nights.

==BBC Radio Cumbria Sport / BBC Sport Cumbria==
The station&#x27;s sport service provides exclusive commentary on Cumbria&#x27;s two professional English Football League clubs, Carlisle United and Barrow, along with exclusive commentaries on the county&#x27;s three semi-professional rugby league clubs, Barrow Raiders, Workington Town and Whitehaven.

BBC Cumbria Sport can also be found on Twitter and on BBC Sounds.

The station&#x27;s sport department won a Radio Academy Award in 2003 for its Saturday Sport show, a Carlisle United. debate, facing competition in the Sport category from BBC World Service, Capital Gold and BBC Radio 5 Live.

<text>Trident Ploughshares (originally named Trident Ploughshares 2000) is an activist anti-nuclear weapons group, founded in 1998 with the aim of &quot;beating swords into ploughshares&quot; (taken from the Book of Isaiah). This is specifically by attempting to disarm the UK Trident nuclear weapons system, in a non-violent manner. The original group consisted of six core activists, including Angie Zelter, founder of the non-violent Snowball Campaign.

Based in Edinburgh, Scotland, the group is a partner in the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. It has attracted media attention for both its non-violent &quot;disarmament&quot; direct actions, and mass civil disobedience at the gates of Royal Navy establishments with connections to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Trident weapons systems.

It was the recipient of the Right Livelihood Award in 2001 &quot;for providing a practical model of principled, transparent and non-violent direct action dedicated to ridding the world of nuclear weapons.&quot;

==Trident nuclear missile system and international law==
The foundation of Trident Ploughshare&#x27;s various disarmament actions is the 1996 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice, &quot;Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons&quot;, in which it found that &#x27;the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict&#x27;.

In addition to this, Trident Ploughshares also argues that, since the British government is not actively negotiating nuclear disarmament and is actively considering upgrading the UK Trident programme, it is in violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968.

Trident Ploughshares activists argue that since the British government has not responded to their various communications regarding the legal status of the Trident nuclear missile system, they must take individual responsibility for disarmament.

== Previous Ploughshares actions==
Prior to the setting up of Trident Ploughshare there were other actions carried out by members of the Ploughshares Movement, a Christian peace group.

On 29 January 1996, Andrea Needham, Joanna Wilson and Lotta Kronlid - known as the &#x27;Ploughshares Four&#x27; - broke into the British Aerospace factory in Lancashire and caused £1.7m worth of damage to BAe Hawk number ZH955, a training aircraft that was to have been supplied along with 23 other jets to the New Order regime of Indonesia. Angie Zelter was later arrested as she announced her intention to further damage the planes.

Accused of causing, and conspiring to cause, criminal damage, with a maximum ten-year sentence, they argued that what they did was not a crime but that they &quot;were acting to prevent British Aerospace and the British Government from aiding and abetting genocide&quot;. They were acquitted by the jury.

==Protests and criminal trials==

The second major disturbance was on 27 April 2001, when three female members of the campaign boarded the barge &quot;Maytime&quot; in Loch Goil and destroyed and took equipment. After being charged with maliciously damaging the vessel, stealing two inflatable life rafts and damaging equipment in an on-board laboratory, they were acquitted at the subsequent trial in Greenock, which was later appealed to the Scottish High Court with the Lord Advocate&#x27;s Reference 2001. Although under Scottish Law the High Court did not have the power to overturn the acquittals, their judgement was that the basis of the defence case should not have been admissible.

In May 2005 the group squatted on Drake&#x27;s Island, a privately owned island in Plymouth Sound declaring it a &quot;nuclear free state&quot; in order to &quot;highlight Britain&#x27;s hypocrisy over the non-proliferation treaty talks being held in New York&quot;.

<doc id="569946" wikidata="Q981659" url="?curid=569946" title="New Mexico State Road 1">
<text>State Road 1 (NM 1) is a state highway in New Mexico, that runs north from Mitchell Point to Socorro. Mostly paralleling Interstate 25 (I-25) throughout its entire length, it has a total length of , and is maintained by the New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT).

After an intersection with NM 107, NM 1 passes dirt roads leading to Fort Craig and San Marcial. It then goes through the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, as well as the communities of San Antonio, where it intersects U.S. Route 380 (US 380), and Luis Lopez, before ending in Socorro.

==Route description==
State Road 1 begins at an interchange with Interstate 25, in Mitchell Point. It then quickly turns to parallel I-25, and travels alongside the freeway through barren terrain. The route begins to turn away from I-25 near the Sierra–Socorro county line, and connects to I-25 Exit 100 via a spur.

In Socorro County, State Road 1 continues to parallel I-25, though at a greater distance. NM 1 crosses under the larger highway as they near a rest area, serving I-25 traffic. Shortly thereafter, State Road 1 intersects State Road 107, providing a connection to Magdalena. Past NM 107, NM 1 passes a dirt road, allowing access to the former Fort Craig. The road begins traveling in a more easterly direction, coming close to the Rio Grande. NM 1 intersects another dirt road, which provides access to San Marcial, and passes through the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, on the way to San Antonio.

Known as Main Street in San Antonio, State Road 1 intersects U.S. Route 380. NM 1 also goes through Luis Lopez, before crossing over I-25 again, turning again to parallel the successor route. The older road travels north, passing by the Socorro Municipal Airport before ending at I-25 Bus. in Socorro.

==History==
State Road 1 generally follows the route of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, which was a colonial trade route between Mexico City and San Juan Pueblo (present day Ohkay Owingeh). This became the original State Road 1 upon the initial definition of highways.

In the initial plans for the U.S. Highway System, the portion of State Road 1 south of Raton was designated as U.S. Route 466 (US 466; not to be confused with the later, signed route of the same number, now decommissioned). However, by the time the plan was finalized, US 466 had been merged into U.S. Route 85. Also, US 66 ran on the part of State Road 1 from south of Las Vegas to Los Lunas.

In the 1960s, US 85 was almost entirely supplanted by Interstate 25. The U.S. Route 85 designation has since been completely deleted from the NMDOT route logs, (although AASHTO retains the US-85 designation, following I-25 and I-10 through New Mexico to maintain continuity between signed segments in Texas and Colorado). The State Road 1 designation was then resurrected for use on the portion of old US 85 from Truth or Consequences to Socorro.

<text>Darkstone: Evil Reigns (Darkstone in North America) is an action role-playing video game developed by Delphine Software International for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation. In 2014, the French publisher Anuman Interactive launched a remake available on iPad, iPhone and Android, with the cooperation of the original game&#x27;s author Paul Cuisset.

==Plot==
In the distant past a corrupt monk, Draak, turned against the goddess of light, Kaliba, and turned himself into a dragon. However, he was eventually thwarted from destroying the world via the Time Orb, created from seven of Kaliba&#x27;s tears. To protect the Time Orb from Draak&#x27;s followers, it was split apart again by Kaliba&#x27;s monks and the seven crystals hidden across the four lands of Uma.

The game begins when Draak has recovered from his earlier defeat and returned with his minions to the world of Uma. As part of his return he has created the Darkstone, which drains life energy from Uma, bringing death and mayhem. Players take on the role of an adventurer who has to recreate the Time Orb and use this to slay Draak in his lair.

Beginning in an unnamed village, the player can choose from a range of characters (warrior/Amazon, wizard/sorceress, assassin/thief and monk/priestess) and from here they quest across the four lands of Uma - Ardyl, Marghor, Omar and Serkesh - to solve quests, kill the evil creatures roaming the lands and delve into dungeons to locate the seven crystals to form the Time Orb. At some point in the gameplay the Darkstone itself erupts out of the ground in the village, switching the game from the previous colour scheme of a sunny day to more oppressive purples.

There are seven crystals to be found after completing quests in the dungeons: the purple Crystal of Wisdom, the red Crystal of Virtue, the blue Crystal of Bravery, the yellow Crystal of Nobility, the turquoise Crystal of Compassion, the green Crystal of Integrity and the grey Crystal of Strength. These are magically reassembled by the hermit Sebastian to form the crystal Time Orb.

Villagers will ask the player to do optional quests in return for money, either retrieving artifacts or killing an infamous monster, and are randomly selected for each new game. The artifacts are the Holy Grail, the Royal Diadem, the Shield of Light, the Unicorn&#x27;s Horn, the Horn of Plenty, the Dragon&#x27;s Scale, the Magic Anvil, the Path Book, the Medallion of Melchior, the Sacred Scroll, the Stone of Souls, the Cursed Sword, the Storm Flower, the Claw of Sargon, the Celestial Harp, the Bard&#x27;s Music Score and the Broken Vase. The monsters are the ratman Buzbal the Furious, the vampire Nosferatu and the skeletal Evil Garth.

The crystal quests are found by exploring the lands of Uma to find NPCs who send you into nearby dungeons.

== Gameplay ==
A typical medieval RPG, Darkstone is similar to Baldur&#x27;s Gate and Diablo in gameplay style and themes.

Gameplay revolves around improving the character stats of strength, magic, dexterity and vitality as well as the character&#x27;s gear, weapons, magical knowledge, etc. The four lands of Uma increase in difficulty and are accessed sequentially, with different enemies patrolling the lands and dungeons beneath.

The village acts as an initial training area with firing ranges and example weapons, then subsequently as a trade base for adventurers to sell their loot, bank their cash, buy upgrades, repair armour and weaponry, buy new spellbooks and stock up on health and mana potions as well as food (characters can die from hunger). It is possible to pick up cursed items, such as a cloak that makes the player randomly drop items from their inventory, so a shopkeeper can remove these for you. Finally, if the player wants to hear a song about the Darkstone, they can toss a coin to the singer Audren.

Magic can be learnt by all characters, via finding or buying spellbooks, with 32 potential spells of varying difficulty. A variety of skills can also be learnt, such as thieving from other characters, repairing your own gear, disarming traps, etc. Spells and skills can be acquired by all character types apart from lycanthropy, which can only be learnt by the sorceress. This allows her to change into a werewolf and converts all magic stat points to strength points.

Quests for each new game are randomly selected from 20 options, with different dungeon placement and land layouts, improving the game&#x27;s replayability. The PC version allows the player to control two characters, switching between them at will, though the Playstation version only allowed for a single character.

==Development==
&quot;Darkstone&quot; was developed under the working title &quot;Dragon Blade&quot; and went through several iterations, initially being designed as a fully 3D game akin to &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. After the game&#x27;s original publisher, BMG Interactive, closed its doors, work on &quot;Dragon Blade&quot; went into a suspended state, with Delphine putting most of its resources towards developing &quot;Moto Racer 2&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Darkstone&quot; was released in 1999 for the PC. Although Delphine self-published the game in Europe, it was instead published by Gathering of Developers in the US. In March 2000, Delphine released an editor for custom quests via their website. Simultaneously, Delphine also released Darkstone: Journey in Uma online, a free expansion for &quot;Darkstone&quot; which contained additional quests.

A PlayStation version was made available in 2001. Versions for iOS and Android was later released on 19 March 2014. The game was eventually released on Steam for modern operating systems.

==Reception==
===Reviews===
The PlayStation version received mixed reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

&quot;IGN&quot; said of the PC version that, despite playing &#x27;very similarly to Diablo&#x27;, it &#x27;is an incredibly fun and addictive game&#x27; and that the &#x27;voice-overs are clean and crisp, and surprisingly well acted&#x27;. For the PlayStation version, however, the website later stated, &#x27;anybody who liked Diablo or anything else in the realm of dungeon-hack RPGs should be able to get their pocket-change&#x27;s worth out of it&#x27;, but that the 3D presentation means there is a loss of graphical detail and the lack of story means that it is a basic hack n slash dungeon crawler. Jeff Lundrigan of &quot;NextGen&quot;″s November 1999 issue called the former &quot;An addictive little title that is, in some ways, even better than the trendsetter it closely resembles.&quot; Eighteen issues later, however, Emmett Schkloven called the latter &quot;an addictive action RPG port, and the graphics are impressive. But if its generic elements prevent it from being a classic, the cheap entry fee still makes it worthwhile.&quot;

Michael L. House of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave the PC version four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that it &quot;contains a veritable treasure-trove of other features such as generously creepy sound effects, heart-rending cries for help when your co-companion needs help, a haunting and effective music track (be sure to give the balladeers in town a few gold pieces, then just sit back, close you eyes and enjoy), supremely enjoyable multi-player action, incredibly deep quests and integrated puzzle-solving (such as stringing events and knowledge together to complete a sub-quest). I don&#x27;t throw recommendations around lightly -- but if you&#x27;re a big RPG fan like me, you owe it to yourself to grab this one.&quot; John Thompson gave the PlayStation version three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, &quot;In the end, &quot;Darkstone&quot; plays well, even if it is a bit repetitive and clichéd. For ten dollars, fans of the genre can&#x27;t do any better, and even weekend hack-n-slashers just might get a kick out of this game without feeling like they paid 30 bucks too much.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; gave the former version six out of ten, saying, &quot;The particle effects and realtime lighting generated by the multitude of magic spells are fantastic, and it is certainly one of the most cleanly presented PC games you&#x27;re ever likely to see. But &quot;Darkstone&quot; lacks passion, and that&#x27;s a fatal flaw in any roleplaying game, no matter how innovative and easy it is to play.&quot;

Barry Brenesal of &quot;GamePro&quot; called the PC version &quot;a &quot;Diablo&quot; clone: a real-time action game complete with spells, swords, dozens of quests, and thousands of monsters-and a few interesting ideas of its own.&quot; However, Uncle Dust said of the PlayStation version, &quot;Even at its low price, &quot;Darkstone&quot; isn&#x27;t worth the money. It&#x27;s far better to spend a few more bucks for a used copy of any of the terrific RPGs that have come out for the PlayStation over the years.&quot;

===Sales===
The PC version debuted at #13 on PC Data&#x27;s computer game sales rankings for August 1999. The firm tracked 63,553 domestic sales of the game through the end of 1999. This number rose to roughly 75,000 units by March 2000, which led &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s writer P. Stephan &quot;Desslock&quot; Janicki to remark that the game &quot;sold quite poorly&quot;. As of October 2001, the PC version had sold around 130,000 units in the US.

===Awards===
The PC version was a nominee for &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot;″s 1999 &quot;RPG&quot; award, which went to &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot;. It was also nominated for the &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; award at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 1999 Awards, which went to &quot;&quot;.

<text>BBC Radio Lancashire is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Lancashire.

Originally launched as BBC Radio Blackburn, in 1981 it expanded to cover the whole county and was renamed BBC Radio Lancashire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on Darwen Street in Blackburn.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 150,000 listeners and a 5.8% share as of December 2023.

==Technical==

BBC Radio Lancashire broadcasts on three FM transmitters. The 103.9 FM signal, which covers the central and western parts of the area, comes high on the Winter Hill transmitter, and its height gives it the greatest coverage over Lancashire. The signal can also be picked up nearby in North Manchester. The station&#x27;s other FM transmitters cover the eastern part of the county with an additional FM transmitter covering the Morecambe Bay area.

Beginning on 1 October 2001, the DAB signals have come from the EMAP Digital Central Lancashire 12A multiplex located at Winter Hill and Pendle Forest (near Nelson).

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 712 in the BBC North West region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

Until 17 May 2021, BBC Radio Lancashire was also broadcasting on medium wave.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Blackburn studios from 6 am to 2 pm on Mondays to Fridays and for sports coverage.

The station usually broadcasts the whole of the Late Night programme, a programme carried by all BBC Local Radio stations (except in the case of sports coverage), which is broadcast between 10pm and 1am.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Lancashire simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live

<text>BBC Radio Merseyside is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving Merseyside, North and West Cheshire and West Lancashire. It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds, from studios on Hanover Street in Liverpool. According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 169,000 listeners and a 3.8% share as of September 2024.

==History==

BBC Radio Merseyside was the third BBC Local Radio station to start broadcasting, launching on 22 November 1967 and broadcasting from the sixth floor of council-owned offices in Commerce House, Liverpool. In late 1981, Radio Merseyside moved to a new purpose-built studios on Paradise Street, Liverpool. Broadcasts began from the new studios on 7 December 1981. On 15 July 2006, Radio Merseyside moved from its former home to a new purpose-built studio building on the corner of Hanover Street and College Lane in Liverpool. This building has two ground-floor studios next to a public performance space. An open learning centre was previously located on the first floor and the main office is on the second floor.

In October 2006, the studio building was nominated and made the Building Design shortlist for the inaugural Carbuncle Cup, which was ultimately awarded to Drake Circus Shopping Centre in Plymouth.

Until the late 1980s the station was generally on air from breakfast until teatime, with any local programming after 6 pm being specialist music and magazines aimed at specialist interests and ethnic minority programming, such as &quot;Orient Express&quot; with June Yee. with BBC Radio 2 being carried during the evening and overnight. In early 1989, the four BBC stations in North West England launched an evening service called &quot;Network North West&quot;. This replaced the Radio 2 simulcast with regional programming. The strand was broadcast each night from 7:30 pm until midnight. In May 1991, the four north-west stations joined the BBC Night Network, which had previously provided evening programming for the BBC&#x27;s six North East and Yorkshire stations. At this point, local broadcasts ended at 7:05 pm (7 pm at weekends) until midnight, extending to 12:30 am in the early 1990s, and to 1 am by the end of that decade.

==Technical==

BBC Radio Merseyside broadcasts on 95.8 MHz (Allerton Park) and DAB from the Allerton Park site and DAB signals come from the Bauer Liverpool 10C Multiplex from Billinge Hill (between St Helens and Wigan), Hope Mountain (between Buckley and Wrexham) and St Johns Beacon. 

In 2018, BBC Radio Merseyside launched on BBC Sounds. Local sports commentaries are not broadcast on this service, due to licensing agreements.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 714 in the BBC North West region.

In March 2020, BBC Radio Merseyside&#x27;s 1485 AM license was handed back to Ofcom.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Liverpool studios from 6 am to 6 pm on weekdays and for sports coverage. Until October 2023, the station&#x27;s late show was simulcast with BBC Radio Lancashire on Friday nights and originated from BBC Radio Manchester on Saturday and Sunday nights. It was replaced by an England-wide late show which is broadcast seven days a week.

During the station&#x27;s overnight downtime, BBC Radio Merseyside simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

<doc id="569976" wikidata="Q2669169" url="?curid=569976" title="Kristang language">
<text> or  is a creole language spoken by the Kristang, a community of people of mixed Portuguese and indigenous Malay ancestry, chiefly in Malaysia (Malacca), Singapore and Perth, Australia.

In Malacca, the language is also called ,  (&quot;Malacca Portuguese&quot;),  (&quot;Mother Tongue&quot;) or simply  (&quot;speak&quot;). In Singapore, it is generally known as Kristang, where it is undergoing sustained revitalisation.

In &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot; (2010; formerly the &quot;Red Book of Endangered Languages&quot;) published by UNESCO, Kristang is classified as a &quot;severely endangered&quot; language, with only about 2,000 speakers. Up to 2014, linguists concerned with Kristang have generally accepted a combined speaker population of about 1,000 individuals or less. The language has about 750 speakers in Malacca. A small number of speakers also live in other Portuguese Eurasian communities in Kuala Lumpur and Penang in Malaysia, and in other diaspora communities in Canada, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere.

==Etymology==
Its endonym &quot;Papia Kristang&quot; is taken from Portuguese &quot;papear cristão&quot; (&quot;to chat Christian&quot;). The &quot;papia&quot; element of the name is cognate with Papiamento, another Portuguese-based creole spoken in the Dutch West Indies.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The Kristang language originated after the conquest of Malacca (Malaysia) in 1511 by the Portuguese Empire. Until a takeover by the Dutch in 1642, Malacca served as one of the key ports in the trade and administration network of Portuguese establishments along with Goa and Hormuz, allowing Portugal control over main Asiatic trade routes. The lingua franca of Malacca then was a pidginised form of Malay known as Bazaar Malay or &quot;Melayu Pasar&quot;, used amongst the resident foreign population which then consisted mainly of Javanese, Tamils and Hokkien Chinese. The constant traffic of Portuguese and traders of other origins such as India eventually gave birth to Papia Kristang, one of many Portuguese-derived contact languages which resulted from Portuguese colonial expansion during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. A pidgin Portuguese preceding the Kristang creole has also been proposed, whereby a reduced system based on Portuguese converges with other languages present in the contact situation.

The community of Kristang speakers descends mainly from interracial relationships between Portuguese men and local women, as well as a number of migrants from Portuguese India, themselves of mixed Indo-Portuguese ancestry. This was supported by Portuguese officials who advocated mixed marriages in the face of a labour shortage in the colonies, leading to the very first native speakers of Kristang as well as the development of the creole.

Even after Portugal lost Malacca and almost all contact in 1641, the Kristang community largely preserved its language. The demographics of Malacca in the mid-17th century was still predominantly made up of the Portuguese even under Dutch control. The &quot;Irmang di Greza&quot; (Brothers of the Church), a manifestation of the bond between language and religion in the Kristang culture, acted as an intermediary between the priest and the remnants of the Portuguese population despite prohibition by the Dutch. Liturgy and pastoral sessions were conducted in Kristang in Malacca, which contributed to the longevity of the language into a period as late as the 20th century.

Kristang also had a substantial influence on Macanese, the creole language spoken in Macau, due to substantial migration from Malacca after its conquest by the Dutch.

=== Attrition of Kristang ===
The ceding of Malacca by the Dutch to the British via the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 directly caused the decline of the Kristang language. By the mid 19th century, many Kristangs flocked towards clerical and auxiliary positions provided by their new colonial masters. As such, the Kristang language saw a decline in use compared to English. In addition, the rising affluence of the region meant more job opportunities, resulting in many Kristangs moving away from Malacca. Moreover, the language is not taught at school, although there are still some Church services in Kristang.

In the context of Singapore, Kristang arrived in the 1820s due to the large influx of Eurasian immigrants from Malacca. However, there was little exposure and recognition of Kristang in Singapore, especially when English became entrenched as the sole language of education and the major language used in most spheres of society after the country gained independence in 1965. As a result, the intergenerational transmission of Kristang ceased almost completely.

The upkeep of Kristang can largely be attributed to its connection with the dominant religion of the Portuguese and their relative social standing in their communities between the 1600s to the late 1800s. The core Kristang-speaking communities gradually eroded due to better socioeconomic opportunities elsewhere. Post-World War Two, the new generation of Catholic priests that arrived to replace the pre-war priests who had been executed demonstrated little sensitivity towards the Kristang language and culture. Eventually, the bond between Kristang and religion was severed due to the association of the Portuguese Mission with the St Xavier&#x27;s Church.

Migration overseas and intermarriage with other nationalities have also led to Kristang speakers leaving the Portuguese Settlement in order to live and work in other parts of Malaysia. Furthermore, the dominantly Kristang-speaking middle-class gradually began to speak English for practical reasons, altering the prestige of English with regards to Kristang. To many in the community, they grew to accept that speaking English was a key to employment instead of Kristang, facilitating a breakdown in the transmission of Kristang.

===Revitalisation efforts===
Papia Kristang is facing a steep decline in language use within the community. There has been an apparent language shift to English and Bahasa Malaysia due to the reduced prestige and accessibility of Kristang. However, revitalization efforts have begun in recent years in both the Portuguese Settlement in Singapore and Malacca. Such efforts have seen some success, nearly tripling the number of Kristang speakers of varying fluency.

====Malacca====
The Kristang-speaking community located at the Portuguese Settlement, or Padri sa Chang (“The Priest’s Land”) was able to undertake more sustained revitalisation efforts and publicise itself to non-Eurasian Malaysians, and the language. Notably with texts, stories and phrasebooks in Kristang produced by Joan Margaret Marbeck and through investments and interest from individuals and organisations outside the community. Joan Marbeck has produced three publications: &quot;Ungu Adanza&quot; (An Inheritance), &quot;Linggu Mai&quot; (Mother Tongue) and the Kristang Phrasebook. She is also credited with writing probably the only play in Kristang, called &quot;Seng Marianne&quot; (Without Marianne) and was also instrumental in staging a musical in Kristang - &quot;Kazamintu no Praiya&quot; which translates to &#x27;Wedding on the beach&#x27;.

Within the community, there were efforts made together with the help of academics to promote their culture and the Kristang language. In 1988, Alan Baxter published &quot;A grammar of Kristang&quot; based on his fieldwork within the community. This was the first book which focused on the descriptive grammar of Kristang and established many core concept on Kristang linguistics. It also had a significant impact on many later studies on Kristang.

Support was also received from the Lisbon-based Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, which funded and published Marbeck&#x27;s Kristang text.
Along with Malacca Portuguese-Eurasian Association (MPEA) president Michael Gerald Singho, they published a textbook, &quot;Beng Prende Portugues Malaká (Papiá Cristang)&quot;, also known as Come, Let&#x27;s Learn Portugues Malaká (Papiá Cristang) for people who want to learn Kristang. The association also maintains an active Facebook page aimed at sharing and promoting information related to the Kristang language the Kristang way of life.

==Vocabulary==
The Kristang lexicon borrows heavily from Portuguese, but often with drastic truncation. Due to its largely Portuguese vocabulary, the Kristang lexicon has much in common with other Portuguese-based creoles, including the near-extinct creoles of Indonesia and East Timor. As it is primarily a creole, much of its vocabulary is also derived from Chinese, Indian and Malay languages to varying degrees.

Metathesis was common in the derivation of the Kristang lexicon from Portuguese root words.
e.g.
*Portuguese &quot;gordo&quot; → Kristang &quot;godru&quot; &quot;fat&quot;

== Orthography ==
===Polynomy===
Kristang is a polynomic language, where standardisation of the language&#x27;s spoken and written forms is dispreferred and the natural morphophonological and orthographic variation that Kristang developed as a result of its history and sociocultural context is preferred. This variation is usually concentrated around &quot;famililects&quot; spoken by families rather than geographical dialects, with Kristang famililects generally being categorisable into three distinct forms:

;1. A system based on Portuguese orthography
:The 19th and 20th centuries saw a rise in the use of Modern Portuguese-based orthography (for example, Rego (1942)) due to the perception of Kristang as a variety of Portuguese instead of a distinct creole language partially based on Old Portuguese. This is characterized by the use of diacritics such as acute accents (á, é, í, ó, ú). The system has been adopted by some native Kristang speakers as well.

;2. A system based on a mixture of Portuguese, English and Malay
:Other speakers have used a system influenced by Portuguese, English and Malay orthography. This creates an issue as the system is inconsistent in the representation of Kristang sounds and are unintelligible immediately to both speakers and non-speakers of Kristang.

;3. A system based on Malay orthography
:There are many observable parallels between the phonology of Malay and Kristang which has led to inherent similarities in the orthographic representations of the two languages as well. The first proposal for a standard Kristang orthography was made in 1973 by Ian F. Hancock (1973:25) who recognised this quality and advocated the Malay-based system due to the speakers&#x27; familiarity with it. This would, therefore, lead to a swift acquisition of literacy in the reading and writing of the Kristang language. 
:This system to spell Kristang was further expanded on in &quot;A Grammar of Kristang&quot; by Alan N. Baxter, in which he agreed on and emphasized the use of the Malay orthography. Published in 1995, Joan Margaret Marbeck&#x27;s book &quot;Ungua Andanza&quot; also followed this approach, with the orthography written in a Luso-Malay context.

== Phonology ==
The acoustic and articulatory properties of Kristang have not been extensively studied. However, Hancock (1969, 1973), Batalha (1981), and most recently, Baxter (1988) have outlined brief descriptions of its sound system. In general, Kristang&#x27;s inventory of consonant and vowel phonemes shows a significant parallel to that of Standard Malay.

===Consonants===
Orthographic note:&lt;br&gt;
Using a Malay-based orthography, the sounds are represented orthographically by their symbols as above, except:
* is written as 
* is written as 
* is written as (or , a pre-1972 Malay letter)
* is written as 

Portuguese words which begin with , pronounced (&quot;sh&quot;) in modern Portuguese, are often pronounced as (&quot;ch&quot;) in Kristang, e.g.: 
*Portuguese → Kristang &quot;to arrive&quot;
*Portuguese → Kristang &quot;rain&quot;
This may be due to Malay influence, or the preservation of an Old Portuguese pronunciation in Kristang. It is also worth noting that Northern Portugal also retains the Portuguese pronunciation.

====Phonological contrasts====

Baxter (1988), in particular, established various phonemic contrasts in the Kristang consonant system.

Stops and affricates contrast in the initial and medial positions.

Fricatives contrast in the medial positions. No clear distinctions between voiced-voiceless pairs and all fricative counterparts can be drawn as is highly infrequent and restricted in distribution and initial has fallen into disuse.

Nasals contrast do not contrast before a consonant, and no contrasts have been found in identical environments in the final position. In the initial position, only , and contrast, while all nasals contrast in the medial position. Tap, as well as lateral liquid consonants, contrast in all positions.

===Vowels===


The inventory of vowel phonemes in Kristang is also highly similar to Standard Malay vowel phonemes, which can be seen in the table above.

====Diphthongs and vowel sequences====
Diphthongs in Kristang are formed when either the vowel , or the vowel , occurs in the same syllable as another vowel. The vowel and are pronounced as the semivowels (or glides) and respectively in such cases.

There are 10 word-internal diphthongs in Kristang as outlined by Baxter (1988). Of all 10, 3 ( as in ‘queen’, as in ‘rain’ and as in ‘day’) may also constitute hiatus, i.e. the vowels in would be pronounced as two distinct syllables in certain environments.

The relatively large number of diphthongs is also in contrast to Malay, whereby only three native diphthong phonemes are described:
# : (&#x27;shop&#x27;)
# : (&#x27;buffalo&#x27;)
# : (&#x27;lullaby&#x27;)
These diphthongs also display visible parallels to certain Kristang vowel sequences , and .

The Portuguese diphthong (or archaic ) are often reduced to in Kristang in Portuguese loan words, e.g.: 
*Portuguese / → Kristang &#x27;two&#x27;
*Portuguese / → Kristang / &#x27;tonight&#x27;
Kristang diphthongs are monosyllabic and the vowel sequences are differentiated according to its stress position. For example, the stress in is on the first vowel whereas in , the second vowel is stressed.

===Stress and rhythm===
Kristang is a syllable-timed language (not unlike Malay which also displays syllable-based rhythm).

According to Baxter (2004), most polysyllabic words in Kristang can be classified into two large groups based on the stress position in the word.
;Stress Rule A
Most words which end in a vowel have tonic stress on the penultimate syllable.

;Stress Rule B
Most words which end in a consonant have tonic stress on the final syllable.

However, stress pattern is not completely predictable in Kristang, as there are also certain words which are exceptions to the above two rules. 
:Exception to Rule A
:Verbs which end in a stressed vowel (e.g. &quot;kumi &#x27;to eat&#x27;). Attention should be paid to the lexical stress in such instances as it brings about a difference in meaning (e.g. kaza&quot; &#x27;house&#x27; vs &quot;kaza&quot; &#x27;to marry&quot;).
:Some vowel-ending words are also stressed on the antepenultimate syllable instead. (such as &quot;familia&quot; &#x27;family&#x27;, &quot;animu&quot; &#x27;valour&#x27;)
:Exception to Rule B
:Some consonant-ending words are stressed on the penultimate syllable (such as okel&quot; &#x27;spectacles&#x27;, nobas&quot; &#x27;news&#x27;)

Kristang also displays stress shifting in that many verbs display a tendency to shift their stress from the final syllable to penultimate syllable when followed by a stressed syllable in the next word, especially in rapid speech.

== Grammar ==
The grammatical structure of Kristang is similar to that of the Malay language. The usage of verbs is one of the grammatical features of Kristang that displays this quality. While Portuguese verbs mainly use morphology, or suffixes, to change a verb&#x27;s tense or for it to match with the person and number of its subject, Malay does not change the form of the verb itself. Instead, it makes use of pre-verbal words to convey tense and does not indicate the person or number of the subject in the form of the verb. Kristang&#x27;s structure is practically identical to Malay, although the choice of words comes from Portuguese.

===Syntax===

Papiá Kristang has Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in simple sentences. The direct human objects are case-marked by the preposition &quot;ku&quot;. The same preposition also marks indirect objects. Intransitive clauses, the case-marked indirect object may precede the direct object, especially when the former is pronominal. Noncore arguments are generally located either at the beginning or at the end of the sentence as shown in example (1).

Adversity Passive, which is used to talk about situations where a negative action happens to something, but the person or originator of the negative action is not mentioned something, is also present both in Kristang and Malay. The Adversity Passive is signalled by &quot;kena&quot; (Malay), and by &quot;tokah&quot; (Kristang).

For complex sentences, the phrases and clauses are joined by coordinating conjunctions &quot;ku&quot; &quot;with, and&quot;, &quot;kě&quot; &quot;or&quot;, and &quot;mas&quot; &quot;but&quot;. There are also instances where object clauses may be headed by &quot;ki&quot;; however, this is rare and is only found in traditional formal registers, as in a wedding speech. The most frequent means of expressing nominal subordination is parataxis as shown in example (2) and (3).

Adverbial clauses are headed by &quot;antis di&quot; &quot;before&quot;, &quot;kiora&quot; &quot;when&quot;, &quot;chuma&quot; &quot;as&quot;, &quot;kantu&quot; &quot;if&quot;, &quot;padi&quot; &quot;in order to&quot;, &quot;kauzu ki&quot; &quot;because&quot;, &quot;kifoi&quot; &quot;because&quot;, etc., yet may also be indicated by parataxis without conjunctions.

Relative clauses are headed by &quot;ki&quot; &quot;what, who’&quot;(and very rarely by &quot;keng&quot; &quot;who&quot;), yet also commonly occur with a pronoun head or may occur without it. This can be seen in example (4) and (5).


In Kristang, The noun phrase (NP) is a structure which can occur as subject of a verb,
object of a verb, object of a relator or as a predicate.

There are five types of prenominal determiners in Kristang:

Quantifier:
Numeral:
Interrogative determiner:
Demonstrative article:

The demonstratives &quot;isi&quot; and &quot;ake(li)&quot; ‘that’ precede the noun and indicate a distance contrast.

Possessive NP + &quot;sa&quot; :
Adnominal possessives precede the noun and consist of possessor (noun or pronoun) + genitive marker &quot;sa&quot; (or &quot;sě&quot;).

In comparative constructions of equality, the adjective is marked by &quot;iguál&quot; ‘equal’ and standard is marked by &quot;ku&quot; ‘with’:

In the comparative construction of inequality, the adjective is marked by &quot;más&quot; ‘more’ and the standard by &quot;di&quot; ‘of’:

The superlative comparison consists of the comparative of inequality plus a universal standard:

There is only one set of personal pronouns that occurs in all pronominal functions. The 3SG and 3PL pronouns only refer to animates, principally to humans.

===Morphology===
Pluralisation is also the same in Malay as in Kristang. For example, in English and Portuguese, an ‘’ is added to make cats or gatos, whereas in Kristang and Malay, the entire word is duplicated, such as in Kristang, and in Malay. Reduplication is not only a
feature of the noun class but also a feature of the adjective, adverb and verb classes. Adjectives and adverbs reduplicate to signify intensity: , “quite small, very small”, “quite old”, “quite/very early”. On the other hand, the interrogative pronouns reduplicate to signify indefiniteness: (who who) “whoever”, (what what “whatever”. As for the reduplication of the numerals, “two” and “three”, it gave the respective readings “in pairs” and “in threes”.

With nouns, reduplication can signal plurality, often involving partial reduplication: (= + ) ‘children’, (= + ) ‘women’. However, the reduplication of nouns with non-specific reference in object position may yield the meaning ‘all kinds of’ or ‘lots of’:

Without reduplication, the above sentence would simply express plural: ‘birds’.

To indicate verb tenses, the following appositions are used: (i.e. from the Portuguese , meaning &quot;already&quot;, or controversially a corruption of Malay , shortened version of , also &quot;already&quot;) for past tenses; (from , which means &quot;is&quot;) for present continuous tenses and or (from , which means &quot;soon&quot;) for the future tense. These simplified forms correspond with their equivalents in Malay , , and , respectively.

Papiá Kristang has two overt markers of aspect ( ‘perfective’ and ‘imperfective’), an overt marker of future tense (), and a zero marker.

This table summarised the functions of these markers:

Example (15) shows the zero marker (Ø) with a dynamic verb of past or present habitual representation:

Example (16) shows the marker &quot;ja&quot; with a dynamic verb, with perfective aspect representation:

The marker occurs with dynamic verbs in past or present contexts, with either a progressive reading, as in (17), or an iterative reading, as in (18):

The marker &quot;lo(go)&quot; conveys a future or conditional reading, as in examples (19) and (20), respectively where it occurs with a dynamic verb:

The Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM) markers do not normally co-occur. Combinations of markers are very rare and when they do occur they appear to involve an adverbial reading of the initial marker. Thus, when is seen to combine with the imperfective marker , &quot;ja&quot; has the adverbial reading ‘already’ of its Portuguese source:

== Kristang examples ==

===Numbers===
Much of the lexicon for Kristang numbers draws influence from Portuguese, a Romance language. However, unlike Portuguese, which distinguishes between the masculine and feminine forms of “one” (&quot;um/uma&quot;) and “two” (&quot;dois/duas&quot;), numbers in Kristang do not inflect for gender.

===Pronouns===
A peculiarity of the language is the pronoun &quot;yo&quot; (meaning &quot;I&quot;) which is used in Northern Portuguese (pronounced as &quot;yeu&quot;), as well as Spanish and Italian/Sicilian.
===Common phrases===
===Poem of Malacca===
:&quot;Keng teng fortuna fikah na Malaka,&quot;
:&quot;Nang kereh partih bai otru tera.&quot;
:&quot;Pra ki tudu jenti teng amizadi,&quot;
:&quot;Kontu partih logu fikah saudadi.&quot;

:&quot;Oh Malaka, tera di San Francisku,&quot;
:&quot;Nteh otru tera ki yo kereh.&quot;
:&quot;Oh Malaka undi teng sempri fresku,&quot;
:&quot;Yo kereh fikah ateh mureh.&quot;

Portuguese translation:
:&quot;Quem tem fortuna fica em Malaca,&quot;
:&quot;Não quer partir para outra terra.&quot;
:&quot;Por aqui toda a gente tem amizade,&quot;
:&quot;Quando tu partes logo fica a saudade.&quot;

:&quot;Ó Malaca, terra de São Francisco,&quot;
:&quot;Não tem outra terra que eu queira.&quot;
:&quot;Ó Malaca, onde tem sempre frescura,&quot;
:&quot;Eu quero ficar até morrer.&quot;

English translation:
:Who is lucky stays in Malacca,
:Doesn&#x27;t want to go to another land.
:In here everyone has friendship,
:When one leaves soon has &quot;saudade&quot;.

:Oh Malacca, land of Saint Francis,
:There is no other land that I want.
:Oh Malacca, where there&#x27;s always freshness,
:I want to stay here until I die.

Malay translation:

:Siapa beruntung tinggal di Melaka,
:Tidak mahu ke tanah berbeza.
:Di sini semua bersahabat,
:Bila seorang pergi terasa rindu.

:Oh Melaka, tanah Saint Francis,
:Tiada tanah lain yang ku mahu.
:Oh Melaka, dimana adanya kesegaran,
:Aku mahu tinggal di sini hingga ke akhir nyawa.

<text>BBC Radio Bristol is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the cities of Bristol and Bath and the unitary authorities of Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at Broadcasting House in Bristol.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 55000 listeners and a 0.5% share as of May 2024. The worst performer of all BBC local stations.

==Technical==
BBC Radio Bristol broadcasts on FM frequencies 94.9 MHz (Dundry), 104.6 MHz (Bath), 103.6 MHz (Weston-super-Mare), and on DAB.

The Mendip transmitter, near Wells, used to broadcast BBC Radio Bristol on 95.5 MHz over a very large area but, from 3 December 2007, this was transferred to the new BBC Somerset service. Since the BBC relaunched BBC Somerset on FM, BBC Radio Bristol has been left free to concentrate editorially on Bristol, Bath and the rest of the former Avon area.

On 11 December 2014, the station launched on Freeview channel 711, on the PSB 1 multiplex from the Mendip transmitter and its TV relays. The station also streams online via BBC Sounds.

The AM transmitter at Mangotsfield on 1548 kHz was closed in February 2016.

==Programming==
Weekday programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Bristol studios from 6 am to 2 pm each day. The afternoon programme is shared with BBC Radio Somerset.

Weekday evening programmes are all shared across the BBC West region. 

At weekends, all programmes except Saturday sport are either regional or national.

The late show, airing every day from 10 pm to 1 am, is a national programme originating in either Manchester or London.

BBC Radio Bristol simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live between 1am and 6am.

==Presenters==
===Notable past presenters===
Kate Adie and Michael Buerk produced and presented programmes for BBC Radio Bristol as part of the station&#x27;s launch team in the 1970s. Buerk&#x27;s voice was the first to be heard on the station.

Kenny Everett was a presenter during the early 1970s. He pre-recorded his shows from his farmhouse in Sussex.

Comedian Chris Morris worked for the station in the late 1980s, presenting and producing his own weekend show, &quot;No Known Cure&quot;. He was dismissed from the station after &quot;talking over the news bulletins and making silly noises&quot;.

One of the station&#x27;s longest serving presenters was veteran local journalist Roger Bennett, who joined at launch as a reporter, before going onto present its flagship breakfast programme, &quot;Morning West&quot;, from 1974 to 2003. He continued to freelance at Radio Bristol until his death in July 2005.

Other past presenters include Susan Osman, who also co-presented &quot;Points West&quot; for 14 years, and John Turner, who worked on the station between 1978 and 2007.

Jenni Murray, presenter of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, started her BBC career at Radio Bristol, as well as Susanna Reid, a presenter on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;. 

John Howard, who produced and co-wrote the station&#x27;s 1979 comedy programme &quot;That Was The West That Was&quot;, was a regular presenter on the station in the late 1970s and went on to be one of the main presenters of &quot;You and Yours&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

Steve Le Fevre presented the breakfast programme until 2015 and was the last incumbent to increase listening at that time of day.

Doctor and comedian Dr Phil Hammond presented a Saturday morning show called &quot;Saturday Surgery&quot; for 12 years, but was taken off air in August 2018 after announcing his intention to stand for Parliament.

==Controversy==

In November 2008, BBC Radio Bristol presenter Sam Mason was dismissed following an incident in which it was alleged that she had made racist remarks in an off-air phone conversation during a weekday afternoon show. Whilst phoning a taxi firm in order to send her 14-year-old daughter from Mason&#x27;s Clifton home to her grandparents&#x27; home, she was said to have asked the company not to send an Asian driver.

Presenter James Hanson was eventually found to have breached BBC editorial guidelines by broadcasting a “comedy” song called 
“Hartcliffe Lass”. The lyric, to the tune of Blondie’s “ Heart Of Glass” depicted the story of a woman from the Bristol suburb of Hartcliffe engaging in the practice of “ dogging” with a man who later turned out to be her nephew. Complaints from listeners were dismissed by local managers as without foundation. Hanson himself reportedly advised complainants to, “get a life” on a show subsequent to the broadcast. However, the BBC central editorial complaints decision was upheld as inappropriate for the time of broadcast, Saturday afternoon.

<doc id="569994" wikidata="Q1053032" url="?curid=569994" title="The Great Escape (Blur album)">
<text>The Great Escape is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Blur. It was released on 11 September 1995 on Food and Virgin Records. The album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and charted in the top 10 in more than ten countries around the world. Less than a year after the album was released, it was certified triple platinum in the UK. The album received near-universal acclaim on release.

The album continued the band&#x27;s run of hit singles, with &quot;Country House&quot;, &quot;The Universal&quot;, &quot;Stereotypes&quot; and &quot;Charmless Man&quot; all reaching the top 10 of the UK singles chart. &quot;Country House&quot; was Blur&#x27;s first number one hit in the UK, beating Oasis&#x27; &quot;Roll with It&quot;, in a chart rivalry dubbed &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;.

&quot;The Great Escape&quot; is often considered to be the final album of a trio of Britpop albums released by Blur in the mid-1990s, after &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; (1993) and &quot;Parklife&quot; (1994). With Blur&#x27;s 1997 self-titled album, the band would change direction and move away from Britpop in favour of a more lo-fi and alternative rock sound.

==Background and recording==

===Concept===
On 17 June 1995, lead singer Damon Albarn and bassist Alex James spoke on BBC Radio 1 about coming up with a title for the album; &quot;We&#x27;ve got until this Wednesday, our record company inform us, to come up with it&quot;, said Albarn. &quot;We&#x27;ve been trying to get &quot;life&quot; into it, but nothing was very good – &quot;Wifelife&quot;, &quot;Darklife&quot;, &quot;Nextlife&quot;&quot;, added James.

The album is in the style of a concept album, that is, most of the songs are linked by a similar theme—loneliness and detachment. Albarn subsequently revealed that much of &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is about himself (e.g. &quot;Dan Abnormal&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Damon Albarn&quot;).

===Songs===
&quot;Mr. Robinson&#x27;s Quango&quot; was the first song recorded for the album and &quot;It Could Be You&quot; was the last, in May 1995. The title of the latter was taken from the original advertising slogan of the United Kingdom&#x27;s multimillion-pound-prize National Lottery, which had drawn much public interest after its inception the previous year.

&quot;Yuko and Hiro&quot; was originally titled &quot;Japanese Workers&quot;, and &quot;The Universal&quot; was first attempted during the &quot;Parklife&quot; sessions as a ska number. During the making of &quot;The Great Escape&quot; the song was resurrected by James, who notes in his autobiography, &quot;Bit of a Blur&quot;, that the band had almost given up on getting it to work when Albarn came up with the string section.

One song on the album, &quot;Ernold Same&quot;, features then-MP Ken Livingstone. He is credited in the sleevenotes as &quot;The Right-On&quot; Ken Livingstone. Producer Stephen Street commented, &quot;It was my idea to get him in because I’m not a huge fan of his. We needed somebody with a really nasal, boring voice doing the commentary and I suggested him. He came in thinking he was the bee’s knees and we were fans – we weren’t at all! (&quot;Laughs&quot;) I couldn’t stand him and my preconceptions were confirmed when he insulted the pastel jumper I was wearing that day! But his voice suited the song.&quot;

As with Blur&#x27;s previous two albums, the liner notes also contain guitar chords for each of the songs along with the lyrics.

==Singles==
The album spawned four hit singles for the band with &quot;Country House&quot;, &quot;The Universal&quot;, &quot;Stereotypes&quot; and &quot;Charmless Man&quot;. &quot;Stereotypes&quot; made its debut at a secret gig at the Dublin Castle in London and was considered as the album&#x27;s lead single, but &quot;Country House&quot; got a bigger reaction from fans. &quot;Country House&quot; gave the band their first number one single, beating Oasis to the top spot. &quot;The Universal&quot; and &quot;Charmless Man&quot; both reached the top 5, whilst &quot;Stereotypes&quot; peaked at number 7. In Japan, &quot;It Could Be You&quot; was released as a four-track single, featuring B-sides recorded live at the Budokan.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;The Great Escape&quot; was met with widespread acclaim from critics. David Cavanagh in &quot;Select&quot; called it &quot;a funny, brave and heartbroken record&quot; that &quot;has everything you could want&quot;, while &quot;NME&quot; reporter Johnny Cigarettes wrote: &quot;&quot;The Great Escape&quot; is so rammed with tunes, ideas, emotions, humour, tragedy, farce, and edgy beauty that it&#x27;s utterly beyond contemporary compare.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Paul Lester awarded the album an unconventional 12/10 and deemed it superior to celebrated predecessor &quot;Parklife&quot;, while noting that &quot;Blur understand the geometry of the song, and the basic principles of pop, better than anyone today&quot;. In response to &quot;album of the decade&quot; claims from &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, J. D. Considine of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said: &quot;&quot;The Great Escape&quot; may not be the defining work of the &#x27;90s, but it is the best Brit-rock release this year.&quot; Less enthused was &quot;Spin&quot; journalist Chuck Eddy, who felt the LP ranged from &quot;wonderful&quot; to &quot;detached and emotionally stiff&quot;. &quot;The Great Escape&quot; was named as one of the 10 best records of 1995 in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;Select&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; readers voted it the third-best album of the year.

Support from the music press soon tapered off, however, and &quot;The Great Escape&quot; gained many detractors. The greater commercial success of rival band Oasis is seen to have played a role in this revaluation; BBC Music writer James McMahon recalled how the &quot;critical euphoria&quot; surrounding the album lasted &quot;about as long as it took publishers to realise Oasis would probably shift more magazines for them&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; would issue an apologia for its five-star review of the record, while Graeme McMillan in &quot;Time&quot; remarked that it lacks the &quot;breadth and heart&quot; of &quot;Parklife&quot;, feeling &quot;cynical and uninspired in comparison&quot;. Drowned in Sound reporter Marc Burrows felt the LP had been overrated and then underrated, writing: &quot;Reality is somewhere in between... &quot;The Great Escape&quot; reveals itself as flawed, melancholy, occasionally stunning and utterly bonkers.&quot; Other journalists retained an unapologetically favourable stance: the album was described by AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine as &quot;a vibrant, invigorating record&quot; that &quot;bristles with invention&quot;, while Brian Doan of PopMatters dubbed it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; whose content examines the costs of &quot;trusting in stasis&quot;.

Damon Albarn has expressed distaste for the album in later interviews, describing it as &quot;messy&quot; and one of the two &quot;bad records&quot; he has made in his career (the other being Blur&#x27;s debut album &quot;Leisure&quot;).

&quot;Select&quot; named the record the 34th-best of the 1990s, while &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it 70th. It was ranked by BuzzFeed as the sixth-best album of the Britpop era. &quot;The Great Escape&quot; also placed at number 725 in the 2000 edition of the book, &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In October 2023, the Official Charts Company revealed that &quot;The Great Escape&quot; was the twenty-first most streamed album from the 1990s in the United Kingdom.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Great Escape&quot; continued the commercial success of previous album &quot;Parklife&quot;. While the latter was more of a sleeper hit, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; registered strong first-week sales of 188,000. In its first year, the album sold 68,000 copies in the US. By late 1996 the album had sold approximately 600,000 units in continental Europe. According to Food managing director Andy Ross, it &quot;comfortably outsold &quot;Parklife&quot; everywhere except the UK. The total figure was up 400,000 and the balance came mainly from Europe and Southeast Asia.&quot; Sales in France up to late November 1996 were 125,000 units, compared with 69,000 for &quot;Parklife&quot;. In Italy, sales were 83,000 compared with 16,000 for &quot;Parklife&quot;.

<text>BBC Radio Gloucestershire is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Gloucestershire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, AM, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at Portland Court in Gloucester.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 49,000 listeners and a 3.4% share as of December 2023.

==Technical==
The main FM transmitter is at Churchdown Hill near to jct 11 on the M5 which broadcasts on 104.7 FM to Gloucester, Cheltenham and Tewkesbury. The FM output is relayed from the Stroud transmitter on 95 FM and from the Cirencester transmitter on 95.8 FM.

The station commenced broadcasting on DAB digital radio on 18 October 2013 as part of the Gloucestershire local multiplex. The DAB transmitters are located at Churchdown Hill (for the Severn Vale, including the Cheltenham/Gloucester conurbation), Stockend Wood (for south of Gloucester, parts of Stroud Valleys and shores of the River Severn), Icomb Hill, near Bourton-on-the-Water (for the north Cotswolds) and Cirencester (for the south Cotswolds).

The AM transmitter is at Berkeley Heath and broadcasts on 1413 kHz to the Forest of Dean, Dursley and Stroud valleys. AM transmissions from Stow-on-the-Wold to the north Cotswolds ceased on 7 June 2021.

The station is also available on Freeview TV channel 716 in the BBC West, BBC West Midlands and BBC South regions. Audio heard on Freeview is the same as the FM output.

The station is available to stream online around the world via BBC Sounds. Audio heard on BBC Sounds is the same as FM output. Most football commentaries cannot be heard online due to rights restrictions, but FA Cup football games can be heard online in the UK. Most Gloucester Rugby games can be heard worldwide with the exception of European Champions Cup games which can only be heard in the UK.

Listeners in South Gloucestershire cannot get FM signals that broadcast BBC Radio Gloucestershire. The area is officially served by BBC Radio Bristol which broadcasts on 94.9 FM from the Dundry East transmitter. 

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Gloucester studios from 6 am to 2 pm on Mondays to Fridays. The afternoon programme is shared with BBC Radio Wiltshire and the weekday evening shows (6 pm to 10 pm) are all broadcast across the BBC West area with the exception of sport programmes. Manny Masih&#x27;s Monday evening programme originates in Gloucester.

Weekend programmes from 6am to 2pm are shared regionally across the BBC West area. The breakfast show is presented from Gloucester. The Saturday afternoon sport programme (2pm to 6pm) broadcasts only to Gloucestershire and splits frequencies when multiple commentaries are broadcast. The Sunday afternoon programme (2pm to 6pm) is currently shared with BBC Radio Wiltshire although the BBC intends to make this a national programme in the autumn of 2024.

The weekend 1800 to 2200 programmes on a Saturday are both broadcast across the BBC West area with the Sunday evening programme in that time slot being a national programme from London.

The late show, airing from 10 pm to 1 am, is a national programme originating in either Manchester or London.

BBC Radio Gloucestershire simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live from 1am to 6am.

Tomorrow when the newest update goes live, a bug in the system will lead thousands of players to their deaths.

However the Teachers discover that Tom Harris is alive and that Freddy had lied to them forcing Alex and Freddy to have a Shootout at El Dorado the next morning. Ben Daniels got Alex&#x27; information and tries to have the CIA help Alex but instead their new boss wants to kill Nightshade in one fell stroke and destroy El Dorado. To that end he is ordering an air strike on the town. In the evening Alex gives William a picture of him and his mother trying to trigger childhood memories.

<doc id="570023" wikidata="Q165916" url="?curid=570023" title="USS Montpelier (SSN-765)">
<text>USS &quot;Montpelier&quot; (SSN-765), a , is the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Montpelier, Vermont. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 6 February 1987 and her keel was laid down on 19 May 1989. She was christened 6 April 1991, launched on 23 August 1991 sponsored by Mrs. Nancy Hayes Sununu, and commissioned on 13 March 1993 with Commander Victor Fiebig in command.

==Service history==
USS &quot;Montpelier&quot; was the first submarine to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles in Operation Iraqi Freedom. She would go on to fire all 20 missiles earning her a &quot;clean sweep&quot; under the command of CDR William J. Frake.

On 27 May 2004 &quot;Montpelier&quot; went through an 18-month Depot Modernization Period (DMP) at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. The ship and crew completed this period three months ahead of schedule and, after successfully completing sea trials returned to their home port in Virginia. The boat entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 5 February 2010 for modernization, maintenance, and upgrades, expected to cost around $35 million for 640,000-man hours, and included changing the submarine&#x27;s buoyancy characteristics and upgrading its sonar capabilities. The work was completed and the sub returned to the fleet on 26 July 2010, eight days earlier than scheduled.

===Accident===
On 13 October 2012, USS &quot;Montpelier&quot; collided with the cruiser off the east coast of the United States near Florida. Both ships were conducting a training exercise at the time of the incident. No one on board either ship was injured. The sub&#x27;s captain, Commander Thomas Winter, was relieved and the sub has since undergone $70 million in repairs.

<doc id="570026" wikidata="Q5985813" url="?curid=570026" title="Icelandic nationalism">
<text>is the Icelandic term for nationalism; &quot;nationmindedness&quot; is a rough translation of the term. Its use was instrumental in the Icelandic movement for independence from Denmark, led by Jón Sigurðsson.

Icelandic nationalism or is based upon the idea of resurrection of the Icelandic Free State, and its values (or what was believed to be its values): democracy, freedom of the individual, the need for the country to be independent, and respect for the cultural and religious traditions, especially the long preserved language. These ideas are often encoded in the popular phrase (&#x27;land, people, and language&#x27;). Historically, Icelanders have seen their current republic to be the reincarnation of the old Free State, and thus Icelandic nationalism today is based upon preserving what was gained by the independence movement. Thus Icelandic nationalist sentiment, having some aspects of civic and ethnic nationalism, is highly respectful of democratic parliamentary powers (see resurrected Althing) and skeptical of foreign control over Iceland, which is partly responsible for there being little will in Iceland for joining the European Union.

Icelandic nationalism primarily arose in the 19th century, during a time when it was under Danish hegemony. It arose not only due to pride in Iceland&#x27;s achievements in the Middle Ages and a desire to embrace Icelandic cultural peculiarities, but also in reaction towards the increasing economic liberalism of the Danish government and thus a defense of Icelandic peasant life. One towering figure was Jón Sigurðsson, who was the preeminent figure of Icelandic nationalism in the 19th century and on whose birthday, 17 June 1944, the modern Icelandic republic intentionally declared independence.

<doc id="570028" wikidata="Q354873" url="?curid=570028" title="Peter Coyote">
<text>Peter Coyote (born Robert Peter Cohon; October 10, 1941) is an American actor, director, screenwriter, author, and narrator of films, theater, television, and audiobooks. He worked on films, such as &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), &quot;Cross Creek&quot; (1983), &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; (1985), &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; (1992), &quot;Kika&quot; (1993), &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (1998), &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000), &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; (2002), and &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (2002).

His voice work includes his narration for the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics. He narrated the PBS series &quot;The Pacific Century&quot; (1992), winning an Emmy. He won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator in 2015 for his work on Ken Burns″s documentary miniseries &quot;The Roosevelts: An Intimate History&quot;.

Coyote was one of the founders of the Diggers, an anarchist improv group active in Haight-Ashbury during the mid-1960s, including the Summer of Love.

==Early life==
Coyote was born Robert Peter Cohon on October 10, 1941, in New York City, the son of Ruth (née Fidler) and Morris Cohon, an investment banker. His father was of Sephardic Jewish descent and his mother came from a working-class Ashkenazi Jewish family. Her father, trained as a rabbi in Russia, escaped being drafted into the Imperial Russian Army, and eventually ran a small candy store in the Bronx. Coyote &quot;was raised in a highly intellectual, cultural but unreligious family&quot;, involved in left-wing politics. He grew up in Englewood, New Jersey, and graduated from Dwight Morrow High School there in 1960. Coyote later said that he was &quot;half black and half white inside&quot; due to the strong influence of Susie Nelson, his family&#x27;s African-American housekeeper. Coyote is the maternal uncle of librarian Jessamyn West.

While a student at Grinnell College, Iowa, in 1961, Coyote was one of the organizers of a group of twelve students who traveled to Washington, D.C. during the Cuban Missile Crisis supporting President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;peace race&quot;. Kennedy invited the group into the White House, the first time protesters had ever been so recognized, and they met for several hours with McGeorge Bundy. The group received wide press coverage. They mimeographed the resulting headlines and sent them to every college in the United States. He was also in a band called the Kittatinny Mountain Boys.

Upon graduation from Grinnell with a Bachelor of Arts in English literature in 1964, he moved to the West Coast, despite having been accepted at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, and commenced working toward a master&#x27;s degree in creative writing at San Francisco State University.

===Name change===
While still at Grinnell, Coyote ingested peyote and had a profound experience with something he recognized as an animal spirit. At the next dawn he came to in a cornfield dotted with paw-prints. A few years later, he came across &quot;Coyote&#x27;s Journal&quot;, a poetry magazine, and recognized its logo as the same paw-prints he had seen during his peyote experience. After meeting Rolling Thunder (John Pope), a purported Paiute-Shoshone shaman, who informed him that there were two ways to regard what he had experienced. &quot;You could consider it a hallucination&quot;, he said, &quot;and you&#x27;ll just remain a white man and be ok. Or, you could consider that the Universe opened itself to you, and if you consider it deeply enough, you might become a human being.&quot; Peter considered what he had been saying for several months, and then changed his last name to Coyote, the first step toward understanding its significance. The immediate, unanticipated consequence, was that no one, not even Peter knew who Peter Coyote was, and he was liberated from his personal history. From that point on, he never knew &quot;where the rabbit would break from the brush&quot;.

==Countercultural activities==
After a short apprenticeship at the San Francisco Actor&#x27;s Workshop, he joined the San Francisco Mime Troupe, a radical political street theater whose members were arrested for performing in parks without permits. Coyote acted, wrote scripts, and directed in the Mime Troupe. Coyote directed the first cross-country tour of &quot;The Minstrel Show, Civil Rights in a Cracker Barrel,&quot; a controversial play closed by authorities in several cities.

From 1967 to 1975, Coyote was a prominent member of the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury counterculture community and a founding member, along with Emmett Grogan, Peter Berg, Judy Goldhaft, Kent Minault, Nina Blasenheim, David Simpson, Jane Lapiner, and Billy Murcott, of the Diggers, an anarchist group known for operating anonymously and without money. They created provocative &quot;theater&quot; events designed to heighten awareness of problems associated with the notion of private property, consumerism, and identification with one&#x27;s work. They fed nearly 600 people a day for &quot;free&quot;, asking only that people pass through a six-foot by six-foot square known as The Free Frame of Reference. They ran a Free Store, (where not only the goods, but the management roles were free), a Free Medical Clinic, and even a short-lived Free Bank. The Diggers evolved into a group known as the Free Family, which established chains of communes around the Pacific Northwest and Southwest. Coyote was the best known resident of the Black Bear Ranch commune in Siskiyou County, California.

==Discovering Zen==
Coyote had first discovered Zen in his teens via the works of Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, and other Beats. Coyote met Snyder with the Diggers and was impressed with Snyder&#x27;s &quot;gravitas and elegance, his care and deliberation&quot;.

In 1975, Coyote undertook meditation practice and eventually became a dedicated practitioner of American Zen Buddhism, moving into the San Francisco Zen Center. He was later ordained a lay priest in the Sōtō tradition and was ordained as a Zen Priest in 2015.

Coyote performed audiobook recordings of Shunryu Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot; and Paul Reps&#x27;s &quot;Zen Flesh, Zen Bones&quot; as well as narrating the documentary &quot;Inquiry into the Great Matter: A History of Zen Buddhism&quot;.

==Film and television acting==
In 1978, Coyote began acting again (&quot;to shake the rust out&quot;) appearing in plays at San Francisco&#x27;s award-winning Magic Theatre. While he was playing the lead in the world premiere of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;True West&quot;, a Hollywood agent approached him, and his film career began with &quot;Die Laughing&quot; (1980). He gave supporting performances in &quot;Tell Me a Riddle&quot; (1980), &quot;Southern Comfort&quot; (1981), and as the mysterious scientist &quot;Keys&quot; in &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982). He was seriously considered for the role of Indiana Jones in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), and auditioned for the part. Coyote&#x27;s first starring role was in the science fiction adventure &quot;&quot; (1982). He also starred in &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; (1985) and &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1987). Since then, he has made more than 120 films for theaters and television and has played starring roles for many directors, including Roman Polanski (&quot;Bitter Moon&quot;), Pedro Almodóvar (&quot;Kika&quot;), Martin Ritt (&quot;Cross Creek&quot;), Jean-Paul Rappeneau (&quot;Bon Voyage&quot;), Diane Kurys (&quot;A Man in Love&quot;), and Walter Salles (&quot;Exposure&quot;). For his 1990 guest appearance on the television series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;, he received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

In addition to his movie work in more recent films such as &quot;Sphere&quot;, &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;, and &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, Coyote has also appeared in many made-for-television movies and miniseries, and he does commercial voice-overs. Coyote was cast in lead roles on several television series: &quot;The 4400&quot; in 2004 and &quot;The Inside&quot; in 2005. After &quot;The Inside&quot; was canceled, Coyote returned to &quot;The 4400&quot; as a special guest star for their two-part season finale, then joined the cast of ABC&#x27;s series &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; as the Vice President of the United States, and the next year did a four-episode turn as Sally Field&#x27;s disreputable boyfriend in &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;.

==Narration==
In 2005, Coyote served as the narrator for several prominent projects including the documentary film &quot;&quot; and the &quot;National Geographic&quot;-produced PBS documentary based on Jared Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;.

==Writing==
Coyote&#x27;s left-wing politics are evident in his articles for &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine, some of which he wrote as a delegate to the 1996 Democratic National Convention; in his disagreements with David Horowitz; and in his autobiography &quot;Sleeping Where I Fall&quot;. In 2006, Coyote developed a political television show for Link TV called &quot;The Active Opposition&quot; and in 2007 created &quot;Outside the Box with Peter Coyote&quot; starting on Link TV&#x27;s special, Special: &quot;The End of Oil – Part 2&quot;.

Many of Coyote&#x27;s stories from the 1967 to 1975 counter-culture period are included in his memoir, &quot;Sleeping Where I Fall,&quot; published by Counterpoint Press in April 1998. One of the stories incorporated into his book is &quot;Carla&#x27;s Story,&quot; about a 16-year-old mother who lived communally with Coyote, and who, after learning of her husband&#x27;s murder, became a drug addict, then a prostitute, had her children stolen, and continued to spiral downhill until she turned her life around. This story was published in &quot;Zyzzyva&quot;, and awarded the 1993–1994 Pushcart Prize. He also states he was a close friend of singer Janis Joplin. Coyote has a website, which features the titles of all his movies and extended samples of much of his writing. He is a member at RedRoom.com, a website for authors.

In April 2015, his memoir &quot;The Rainman&#x27;s Third Cure: An Irregular Education&quot; was released, where he &quot;provides portraits of mentors that shaped him—including his violent, intimidating father, a bass player, a Mafia Consiglieri, and beat poet Gary Snyder, who introduced him to the practice of Zen.&quot;

In September 2021, Four Way Books released a collection of Coyote&#x27;s poetry entitled &quot;Tongue of a Crow&quot;. The poems span five decades and cover his life as &quot;an activist, actor and Zen Buddhist priest.&quot;

<text>The Siberian crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus), also known as the Siberian white crane or the snow crane, is a bird of the family Gruidae, the cranes. They are distinctive among the cranes: adults are nearly all snowy white, except for their black primary feathers that are visible in flight, and with two breeding populations in the Arctic tundra of western and eastern Russia. The eastern populations migrate during winter to China, while the western population winters in Iran and (formerly) in Bharatpur, India.

Among the cranes, they make the longest distance migrations. Their populations, particularly those in the western range, have declined drastically in the 20th century due to hunting along their migration routes and habitat degradation. The world population was estimated in 2010 at about 3,200 birds, mostly belonging to the eastern population with about 93% of them wintering in the Poyang Lake basin in China, a habitat that may be altered by the Three Gorges Dam.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The Siberian crane was formally described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1773 and given the binomial name &quot;Grus leucogeranus&quot;. The specific epithet is derived from the classical Greek words &quot;&quot; for &quot;white&quot; and &quot;geranos&quot; for a &quot;crane&quot;. Ustad Mansur, a 17th-century court artist and singer of Jahangir, had illustrated a Siberian crane about 100 years earlier. The genus &quot;Megalornis&quot; was used for the cranes by George Robert Gray and this species was included in it, while Richard Bowdler Sharpe suggested a separation from &quot;Grus&quot; and used the genus &quot;Sarcogeranus&quot;. The Siberian crane lacks the complex tracheal coils found in most other cranes but shares this feature with the wattled crane. The unison call differed from that of most cranes and some authors suggested that the Siberian crane belonged in the genus &quot;Bugeranus&quot; along with the wattled crane. Comparisons of the DNA sequences of cytochrome-b however suggest that the Siberian crane is basal among the Gruinae and the wattled crane is retained as the sole species in the genus &quot;Bugeranus&quot; and placed as a sister to the &quot;Anthropoides&quot; cranes.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus &quot;Grus&quot;, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, the Siberian crane was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Leucogeranus&quot;. The genus &quot;Leucogeranus&quot; had been introduced by the French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855.

==Description==

Adults of both sexes have a pure white plumage except for the black primaries, alula and primary coverts. The fore-crown, face and side of head is bare and brick red, the bill is dark and the legs are pinkish. The iris is yellowish. Juveniles are feathered on the face and the plumage is dingy brown. There are no elongated tertial feathers as in some other crane species. During breeding season, both the male and female cranes are often seen with mud streaking their feathers; they may intentionally smear mud on their feathers, which has been hypothesized to aid camouflage on the nest. The call is very different from the of most cranes and is a goose-like high pitched whistling &quot;toyoya&quot;. This is a fairly large species of crane, typically weighing and standing about tall. The wingspan is reportedly from and length is . Males are on average larger than females. The average weight of adults in one study was while juvenile birds were slightly heavier on average at . There is a single record of an outsized male of this species weighing . Usually, this crane is usually slightly smaller in weight and height than some other cranes, particularly the sarus crane, wattled crane and red-crowned crane.

==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding area of the Siberian crane formerly extended between the Urals and Ob river south to the Ishim and Tobol rivers and east to the Kolyma region. The populations declined with changes in landuse, the draining of wetlands for agricultural expansion and hunting on their migration routes. The breeding areas in modern times are restricted to two widely disjunct regions. The western area in the river basins of the Ob, Konda and Sossva and to the east a much larger population in Yakutia between the Yana and the Alazeya rivers. Like most cranes, the Siberian crane inhabits shallow marshlands and wetlands and will often forage in deeper water than other cranes. They show very high site fidelity for both their wintering and breeding areas, making use of the same sites year after year. The western population winters in Iran and some individuals formerly wintered in India south to Nagpur and east to Bihar. The eastern populations winter mainly in the Poyang Lake area in China.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Siberian cranes are widely dispersed in their breeding areas and are highly territorial. They maintain feeding territories in winter but may form small and loose flocks, and gather closer at their winter roosts. They are very diurnal, feeding almost all throughout the day. When feeding on submerged vegetation, they often immerse their heads entirely underwater. When calling, the birds stretch their neck forward. The contexts of several calls have been identified and several of these vary with sex. Individual variation is very slight and most calls have a dominant frequency of about 1.4 kHz. The unison calls, duets between paired males and female however are more distinctive with marked differences across pairs. The female produces a higher pitched call which is the &quot;loo&quot; in the duetted &quot;doodle-loo&quot; call. Pairs will walk around other pairs to threaten them and drive them away from their territory. In captivity, one individual was recorded to have lived for nearly 62 years while another lived for 83 years.

===Feeding===
These cranes are omnivorous with a tendency to plant matter. In the summer grounds they feed on a range of plants including the roots of hellebore (&quot;Veratrum misae&quot;), seeds of &quot;Empetrum nigrum&quot; as well as small rodents like lemmings and voles, earthworms, and fish. They were earlier thought to be predominantly fish eating on the basis of the serrated edge of their bill, but later studies suggest that they take animal prey mainly when the vegetation is covered by snow. They also swallow pebbles and grit to aid in crushing food in their crop. In their wintering grounds in China, they have been noted to feed to a large extent on the submerged leaves of &quot;Vallisneria spiralis&quot;. Specimens wintering in India have been found to have mainly aquatic plants in their stomachs. They are however noted to pick up beetles and bird&#x27;s eggs in captivity.

===Breeding===
Siberian cranes return to the Arctic tundra around the end of April and beginning of May. The nest is usually on the edge of lake in boggy ground and is usually surrounded by water. Most eggs are laid in the first week of June when the tundra is snow free. The usual clutch is two eggs, which are incubated by the female after the second egg is laid, with the male standing guard nearby. The eggs hatch in about 27 to 29 days. The young birds fledge in about 80 days. Usually only a single chick survives due to aggression between young birds. The population increase per year is less than 10%, the lowest recruitment rate among cranes. Their success in breeding may further be hampered by disturbance from reindeer and sometimes dogs that accompany reindeer herders. Captive breeding was achieved by the International Crane Foundation at Baraboo after numerous failed attempts. Males often killed their mates and captive breeding was achieved by artificial insemination and the hatching of eggs by other crane species such as the sandhill and using floodlights to simulate the longer daylengths of the Arctic summer.
===Migration===
This species breeds in two regions in the arctic tundra of Russia; the western population along the Ob, Yakutia, and western Siberia. It is a long distance migrant and among the cranes, makes one of the longest migrations. The eastern population winters on the Yangtze River and Lake Poyang in China, and the western population in Fereydoon Kenar in Iran. The central population, which once wintered in Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur, is extinct.

==Status and conservation==

The conservation status of the Siberian crane is very serious. In 2008, the decreasing world population was estimated to be around 3500–4000 individuals, nearly all of them belonging to the eastern breeding population. Of the 15 crane species, this is the only regarded as critically endangered, the highest threatened category by the IUCN (the whooping crane of North America has a smaller but rising population that is better protected, giving the species a status of endangered.) The western population of the Siberian crane had dwindled to four in 2002 and subsequently it was thought to be extirpated, but a single individual, named &quot;Omid&quot;, has wintered in Iran since 2006–2007. The wintering site at Poyang in China holds an estimated 98% of the population and is threatened by hydrological changes caused by the Three Gorges Dam and other water development projects.

Historical records from India suggest a wider winter distribution in the past including records from Gujarat, near New Delhi and even as far east as Bihar. In the 19th century, larger numbers of birds were noted to visit India. They were sought after by hunters and specimen collectors. In 1974, as many as 75 birds wintered in Bharatpur, but this population declined to a single pair in 1992 and the last bird was seen in 2002. An individual that escaped from a private menagerie was shot in the Outer Hebrides in 1891. The western population may even have wintered as far west as Egypt along the Nile.

Satellite telemetry was used to track the migration of a flock that wintered in Iran. They were noted to rest on the eastern end of the Volga Delta. Satellite telemetry was also used to track the migration of the eastern population in the mid-1990s, leading to the discovery of new resting areas along the species&#x27; flyway in eastern Russia and China. The Siberian crane is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies and is subject of the Memorandum of Understanding concerning Conservation Measures for the Siberian Crane concluded under the Bonn Convention.

==Significance in human culture==
For the Yakuts and Yukaghirs, the white crane is a sacred bird associated with sun, spring and kind celestial spirits &quot;ajyy&quot;. In yakut epics Olonkho shamans and shamanesses transform into white cranes.

<text>Dasmariñas (), officially the City of Dasmariñas (), is a component city in the province of Cavite, Philippines. With a land area of and a population of 703,141 people according to the 2020 census, it is the largest city both in terms of area and population in Cavite and the wealthiest Local Government Unit in the province.

Being located just from Imus and south of Manila, the growing congestion and conurbation of the Manila Metropolitan area has led to its rapid development in the late 1900s. This growth is manifested by the influx of major shopping malls, hospitals, universities, banks, industrial parks, and the growing number of residential subdivisions accommodating its growing population.

==Etymology==
Dasmariñas was named after Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, the 7th Spanish governor-general of the Philippines who served from 1590 to 1593. After his death, his son Luis Pérez Dasmariñas became the governor-general from 1593 to 1596. Pérez Dasmariñas came from San Miguel das Negradas of Viveiro, in Galicia, Spain.

Dasmariñas literally means &quot;from &quot;As Mariñas&quot;&quot; (coastal region of Lugo combining the comarcas of A Mariña Occidental, A Mariña Central and A Mariña Oriental), coming itself from &quot;mariño&quot; (&quot;of the coast, seaside or shore&quot; in the Galician language, the native tongue from Viveiro Galicia, Spain), and this from &quot;mar&quot; (&quot;sea&quot;).

==History==

===Foundation and Spanish Ruling===
In the 19th century, during the Spanish colonial period, Dasmariñas was originally called &quot;Tampus&quot;, meaning &quot;end of the forest&quot; in the local Tagalog language. It was formerly a barrio of Imus and part of a vast Recollect hacienda that supported the various missionary activities of the Recollects in the Philippines and Spain.

On April 9, 1864, a council composed of the Archbishop of Manila, the politico-military governor of Cavite, the Prior Provincial of the Augustinian Recollect Order, and the parish priest of Imus met to discuss the creation of a new town and parish to separate from Imus. At that time, there were only 643 inhabitants in Tampus. After thorough discussions, Rafaél de Echagüe, the Governor-General of the Philippines, approved the creation of the new town on May 12, 1864, with Don Juan Ramirez elected as the first town head, or &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot;. The creation of the town was unique among other towns in Cavite. For the first time, a town was established not through a petition from the local populace and its officials, as was customary and legally required, but instead through the initiative of high-ranking church officials and the Cavite politico-military governor.

An ensemble of nipa houses from other barrios of the hacienda, such as Malinta, Nancaan, Salacay, Paliparan, Malagasang, and Salitran, was grouped and migrated into a &quot;reducción&quot; (reduction) in Tampus in 1866. &quot;Reducción&quot; originally referred to the religious and civic aspects of missionary activities but later came to mean the process of resettling and unifying a community, thus creating a newly organized town. For the Spanish missionaries and friars, this process was advantageous for evangelization and consolidating Spanish rule. The new town could be accessed through a well-constructed network of roads and bridges built by the Recollect Order&#x27;s architects and engineers.

In the same year, it was renamed &quot;Perez-Dasmariñas&quot; in honor of the seventh Governor-General of the Philippines, Don Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas (1590–1593). Governor Dasmariñas, a Knight of Santiago, was a native of Galicia, Spain and a former magistrate of Murcia and Cartagena, Spain, who introduced significant economic improvements during the early days of colonization.

By the end of 1866, Perez-Dasmariñas had met the requirements of a typical Philippine town. A spacious town plaza at the center was surrounded by a church and a convent made of stone and bricks, a courthouse constructed from wood and nipa, a primary school for children, and various houses made of nipa. A cemetery was situated approximately 200 yards away from the church and enclosed by a wooden fence.

Due to the growing population, the Recollects sent a petition to Madrid for the establishment of a new parish in Dasmariñas, independent from Imus. Queen Isabella II signed the Royal Order creating the new parish of Perez-Dasmariñas on October 21, 1866. The following year, the construction of the stone parish church of Dasmariñas, dedicated to the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, began.

===The First Barangays===
Dasmariñas was originally composed of several barangays or barrios (neighborhoods). Among these, Salitran was considered the most important and notable during the Spanish regime due to its role as the site of the Recollect estate house. The name Salitran is derived from the Tagalog word &quot;sal-it,&quot; meaning &quot;people from another town.&quot; Being part of the Recollect Hacienda in the town of Imus, Salitran attracted many workers from various provinces who labored as farmhands. Within Salitran, a place called Layong Iloko was named for the Ilocanos who settled there, while Pasong Santol earned its name from the abundance of santol trees in the area.

Tampus, the center of the newly established town, was situated at the end of a deep forest. This contrasts with a sitio in Paliparan called Pintong Gubat, which translates to &quot;gate of the forest.&quot; Barangay names were often inspired by their geographical features, as seen in Barrio Burol, whose name reflects its elevated location. Similarly, Sabang means &quot;crossroads.&quot; Barrio Salawag is believed to have been the old Barrio Salacay, with &quot;salawag&quot; referring to long bamboo poles used for securing nipa roofing.

Nancaan, now known as Langkaan, derived its name from the Tagalog word &quot;langka,&quot; meaning &quot;jackfruit.&quot; The jackfruit, the largest fruit tree in the Philippines, was reportedly introduced from India to Malaysia and later planted in the country by Arabs and Indians. The prevalence of jackfruit trees in the area likely inspired the name Nancaan.

Malinta, or Malintaan, comes from the Tagalog word &quot;linta,&quot; meaning &quot;leech,&quot; due to the abundance of leeches in the area.

On July 18, 1899, three sitios in Perez-Dasmariñas were elevated to the status of barrios: Barrio Sampaloc, named for the abundance of tamarind trees; Barrio Tamban, later renamed San Jose; and Barrio Lucsuhin, renamed San Agustin.

===The Philippine Revolution===

By June 1896, the Spanish authorities in Cavite province had become suspicious of the local elite&#x27;s activities. There were alleged top hierarchy meetings of the Recollects in the hacienda houses of Salitran and San Nicolas. Included in the meeting were General Bernardo Echaluce and other top military officials. The purpose of the meeting was to determine whether it was just to apprehend the notable elites who were Freemasons. Fortunately for the elites, no decision was made during the meeting. Thus, the local leaders freely but quietly continued their subversive activities.

As soon as the revolution of 1896 broke out, leaders of Perez-Dasmariñas took up arms against the Spanish rule. Don Placido Campos, the town head at the time and Don Francisco Barzaga, the municipal secretary, gathered the people to liberate their town from Spanish control at the beginning of September 1896. They captured the courthouse and the hacienda house in Salitran, killing the religious clergy who lived there.

As towns in Cavite fell to Filipino revolutionaries, the Spanish government in Madrid felt that Governor-General Ramon Blanco&#x27;s offensive against the natives was ineffective. Thus, Camilo de Polavieja took over the command of the islands, with General José de Lachambre as the head of the campaign. Gradually, the Spaniards regained the control of the province. After the fall of Silang, the Spaniards focused on Perez-Dasmariñas. Knowing the strength of resistance he might encounter, General Lechambre decided to surround the whole town. He sent to advance units headed by Brigadier General José Molina who went to take the left. The troop under Colonel Arutos who had taken Paliparan, moved westward to cut the escape of the Filipinos to Imus and Carmona. General Lechambre sent the main force towards the south.

The locals suffered terrible defeat because of lack of arms and ammunition. As the Spaniards approached the Poblacion, the revolutionaries retreated the stone building of the town. On February 25, 1897, the Spaniards decided to encircle the Poblacion rather than go directly to the interior. They started burning all buildings except the church. Seeing they were surrounded by fire, some of the rebels went out of hiding but were immediately met by open fire. Those who took refuge at the courthouse refused to come out and were all burned alive. Even those who took refuge in the church did eventually yield to the advancing Spanish forces. By March, Perez-Dasmariñas had fallen back to the Spanish.

Then, General Lachambre returned to Salitran. He expected heavy resistance from the revolutionaries who occupied the hacienda house but to his great surprise, they were able to take the place without any resistance. They hoisted the flag of Spain and converted it to their headquarters.

There were large Filipino casualties according to Lachambre. There were 150 men inside the courthouse when Spaniards set fire to the building and all 150 inside were killed. Others took refuge in the convent, but was also set on fire and the men were shot as they emerged. Others had shut themselves up in the church. With the church surrounded, the mountain artillery was brought up into position and from a distance of 35 meters, the strong doors of the church were bombarded and the troops went in through the breach. At the height of the Battle of Perez Dasmariñas, General Flaviano Yengko, General Crispulo Aguinaldo, Lucas Camerino, Arturo Reyes and many more revolutionaries lost their lives in the battle.

===An American Plan===

With the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898, the Philippines was ceded to America by Spain. The American regime brought to Dasmariñas, as it did to other parts of the country, several fundamental changes in the system of government, in language, and in educational system.

In the month of February 1899, the Philippine–American War began. General Henry Ware Lawton&#x27;s brigade operated south of Manila including the province of Cavite in the middle of June 1899. The Americans could not land directly at Bacoor because Zapote river was defended by the Filipino revolutionists who built trenches as tactical defenses forming three sides of an angle which made the Filipinos hardly visible. The American&#x27;s 14th Infantry Battalion swam across the during the Battle of Zapote River and under the cover of military artillery, charged against the Filipinos who then retreated to the woods.

Moving southward, the Americans encountered more Filipino revolutionaries in the towns of Bacoor, Imus, and Perez-Dasmariñas, and an infantry battalion narrowly escaped annihilation. News had been brought to the American camp that the Filipino soldiers had evacuated the town and that the native mayor was disposed to surrender it formally to the Americans. The battalion thus went there to take possession, but before reaching the place, the Filipino revolutionists closed in on all sides, and a heavy firefight went on for hours. The Americans were saved from destruction by a desperate bayonet charge when they were rescued by General Weaton&#x27;s brigade.

Placido Campos, who sided with General Emilio Aguinaldo since the beginning of the Philippine-American War in 1899, was captured together with his nephew Guillermo Campos. They were imprisoned at the Provost Political Prison in Intramuros where they were kept for six months.

The Americans established military rule in 1900. By order of the colonel of the American troops stationed in Perez-Dasmariñas, the residents of the town nominated a president and a vice-president. Elected through the raising of hands were Francisco Barzaga as president and Conrado Malihan as vice-president. They served their office until the civil government was established by the Americans in 1901.

On January 31, 1901, in accordance with President William McKinley&#x27;s instructions that the Filipinos be allowed to manage their own municipal governments, the Second Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 82, the new Municipal Code, placing each municipal government under the following officials: the municipal president, the vice-president, and the municipal council, who were elected by qualified voters every two years. In line with this, Placido Campos was again elected as the head of the municipality of Perez-Dasmariñas in October 1901. Francisco Barzaga then became the municipal treasurer. The two were re-elected in 1903.

In 1903, the Americans conducted the first census in the Philippines. Francisco Barzaga and the secretary, Esteban Quique, were made census enumerators for Perez-Dasmariñas under the leadership of Placido Campos. When the census was finished, the total population of the town was only 3,500. Before the revolution of 1898, the population was estimated to be 12,000. Comparing the population prior to the revolution with that of 1948, there has been a decrease in the population of Perez-Dasmariñas.

On October 15, 1903, the municipalities of Bacoor and Perez-Dasmariñas were merged with Imus.

In 1917, under Governor-General Francis Burton Harrison, Perez-Dasmariñas was again declared a separate municipality. The provincial governor of Cavite, Antero S. Soriano, convened the local leaders, including Placido Campos, Francisco Barzaga, and Felipe Tirona. Together, they agreed to remove the word &quot;Perez&quot; and retain only &quot;Dasmariñas&quot; as the new name of the town. For the second time, Placido Campos was appointed mayor.

Development slowly came in the 1930s when the Aguinaldo Highway was constructed.

===World War II===

During the Japanese occupation in World War II, the Japanese conducted zonifications in the town. The barrios of Paliparan and Salawag suffered the most number of deaths. Being remote places and thinking that guerrillas were hiding there, these two barrios were zonified two times giving up several lives. The Japanese Imperial Army made the schools as their garrison.

Meanwhile, after surviving in the Bataan Death March and released from Camp O&#x27;Donnell concentration camp in Capas, Tarlac, General Mariano Castañeda returned to Cavite and helped organized the resistance movement in Dasmariñas headed by Colonel Estanislao Mangubat-Carungcong of the 4th Infantry Regiment of Camp Neneng Dasmariñas and Colonel Emiliano de la Cruz of the 14th Infantry Regiment of Camp Paliparan. This unit provided guerilla warfare and was prepared to attack, sabotage missions, cut off enemy communications and logistics, perform recoinnaissance missions, provide protection to civilians against aggression by the Imperial Japanese Army, provide evacuation plans for them, and intensify intelligence reports to the U.S. 11th Airborne Division headed by General Joseph Swing and 187th Glider Infantry Regiment under Colonel Harry B. Hildebrand .

In May 1943, The Imperial Japanese Army have received intelligence reports of the guerilla camp of the 4th Infantry Regiment in the west side of the town. They then positioned two long range cannons and fired 30 rounds, damaging rice plantations and crops, killing a large amount of cattle, and terrorized the Poblacion. Nevertheless, vigilant about the situation, the guerillas have narrowly escaped complete annihilation. After the assault, the town became too hot to the Japanese because of the active guerilla operations and the existence of the headquarters of the guerillas in Neneng Dasmariñas, and because of the Sakdalistas and Makapili (Japanese collaborators) denouncing and reporting all guerilla activities of Colonel Estanislao M. Carungcong to the notorious &quot;Kempeitai&quot;, the Japanese military police, in exchange for payments and privileges, because of it the Kempeitai made another zonification on July 25, 1943, in the town proper until guerilla regimental staff Lt. Colonel Jose M. Carungcong, Major Dominador I. Mangubat, Captain Elpidio Mangubat-Barzaga Sr., and Captain Jovito Evangelista were captured and imprisoned for two months in a prison camp in Muntinlupa until they were released, except for Lt. Colonel Jose M. Carungcong, who was sentenced to six years in prison.

On June 24, 1944, the Hunters ROTC guerillas headed by Colonel Emmanuel de Ocampo, Lieutenant Colonel Vic Estacio, and Colonel Eleuterio Terry Adevoso raided the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa and rescued many prisoners of war and a good haul of firearms and ammunition. Among the prisoners rescued was Lt. Colonel Jose Carungcong, who managed a jailbreak during the raids of the prison camp. Thereafter, the Japanese Military authorities immediately issued a 50,000 peso reward in exchange for his capture.

On August 25, 1944, with the help of the guerilla soldiers of the 4th Infantry Regiment, 114 Filipino military prisoners, 4 American senior officers, Volckmann&#x27;s guerilla, and 70 more prisoners of war made a jailbreak at the prison camp in Muntinlupa. They were in poor health condition, deprived of proper meals, and were too skinny. They were kept in Camp Neneng Dasmariñas and given aid and sustenance and were treated by Major Dominador I. Mangubat, who was also a medical doctor, for two months until they recovered from malnutrition.

On December 17, 1944, from 0100 hours until 1800 hours, around 1,000 &quot;Kempeitai&quot; from Fort Santiago conducted another zonification in the poblacion and adjacent barrios. The Immaculate Conception Parish Church was used as their garrison and all suspected male residents involved or coordinating with the guerrilla operations of Colonel Estanislao M. Carungcong, with the advice of the &quot;Makapili&quot; collaborators, 15 active guerilleros of the Cobra unit 4th Infantry Regiment were tortured inside the church and some others that were brought to the back of the Dasmariñas Elementary School were tortured and bayonetted to death. Some were hanged at the old mango tree near the school canteen, whipped, beaten, tortured to forcefully expose and divulge the guerillas. Women were abducted and raped by the Japanese soldier. There were those who experienced the so-called &quot;tinutubig&quot; wherein the head is immersed in a drum of water.

On January 15, 1945, the day before the FACGF General Castañeda - US 11th Airborne Major Jay Vanderpool conference in Camp Neneng Dasmariñas, local guerrillas ambushed nine Japanese soldiers inside a jitney in Anabu Road in Salitran. The next day, on January 16, Japanese soldiers retaliated by firing indiscriminately on the civilian population.

On January 30, 1945, as Allied forces began to land in Nasugbu, Batangas, the guerilla force of the 4th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Estanislao Mangubat Carungcong, a battalion under Major Zacarias Santiaguel of the 1st Infantry Regiment protected the National Highway 17 (Aguinaldo Highway) and attacked enemy positions at the national Highway 17 from Palapala Road extending 3000 yards east and west of the National Highway 17 up to Salitran Road. The 14th Infantry Regiment headed by Colonel Emiliano de la Cruz protected the highway between Dasmariñas and Carmona to prevent the enemy to rally a counterattack and to clear the path of the U.S. 11th Airborne Division under General 
Joseph Swing which were being dropped via parachute in Tagaytay. Japanese military vehicles approaching from the north, east, and south sides of the town were ambushed.

FACGF Division Commander General Mariano Castañeda issued the command to liberate Dasmariñas to Colonel Estanislao Mangubat-Carungcong. The combined contingent of the FACGF&#x27;s 4th Regiment, together with Colonel Lorenzo Saulog&#x27;s 1st Infantry Regiment and Colonel Maximo Reyes&#x27; 11th Infantry Regiment killed 56 Japanese soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army garrisoned in Dasmarinas and the nearby town of Imus leading to the total liberation of Dasmariñas.

===Post-War===

After the war, the Philippines became independent and Dasmariñas started to develop. The population increased because of the mass exodus of families from Metro Manila and nearby provinces.

The Dasmariñas Bagong Bayan (DBB), also known as Dasmariñas Resettlement Area, was established in 1975 by Letter of Instruction No. 19 issued by the then President Ferdinand Marcos.

From 1983 onwards Dasmariñas had an economic boom. Different factories and establishments sprouted in the town which gave way for the growth in population. From a sixth-class municipality, the town became a first-class municipality.

====Cityhood====

There have been several attempts to convert Dasmariñas into a city. The first attempt was in 1997, when HB08931 was filed by Congressman Renato P. Dragon with other cityhood bills of Imus (HB 08960) and Bacoor (HB 08959). It was filed last February 11, 1997, and read last February 13, 1997. Committee Report N0. 01361 was submitted on December 17, 1997. It was approved on the third reading by the House last January 10, 1998. It did not push through as a Republic Act and no plebiscite happened.

The second attempt was in 2000, when HB099883 was filed by Congressman Erineo Maliksi last March 13, 2000. It was first read last March 13, 2000. It was approved on the Second and Third reading of House last March 15, 2000, and March 27, 2000. It was transmitted to the senate on March 28, 2000, and received on March 31, 2009. It did not push through as a Republic Act and no plebiscite happened.

The idea of converting Dasmariñas into a component city was again proposed for the third time after failure in 1997 and 2000. House Bill no. 5258 converting the municipality of Dasmariñas into a component city was filed by Cavite 2nd District Congressman Elpidio F. Barzaga Jr. on October 3, 2008. It was later signed by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as Republic Act No. 9723 on October 15, 2009.

COMELEC Resolution No. 8682 in connection with the November 25, 2009, plebiscite to ratify the conversion of the municipality of Dasmariñas province of Cavite into a component city pursuant to Republic Act 9723 dated October 15, 2009.

Republic Act No. 9723 was ratified by the registered voters of Dasmariñas through a plebiscite conducted last November 25, 2009, converted the municipality of Dasmariñas in the province of Cavite into a component city to be known as the City of Dasmariñas. There were about 44,000 voters who cast the plebiscite ballot in the town&#x27;s 1,508 polling precincts. The yes votes won overwhelmingly. The yes votes got 36,559 while the no votes got 8,141.

Mayor Jennifer Austria-Barzaga, elected in 2007, is both the first female mayor and first city mayor of Dasmariñas since its achieving city status.

In 2011, the Paro-Paro Festival was first celebrated. It is celebrated every November 26 to commemorate the incorporation of the city of Dasmariñas with people dancing and parading in the streets in butterfly costumes. In November 2013, the Paru-Paro Festival was cancelled as allocated funds would be donated to the Typhoon Yolanda victims.

As of the 2020 census, the city recorded a population of more than 700,000. The city serves as a catalyst for major economic development and sustained growth for the Greater Manila Area since the 1990s. The influx of industries, educational and health institutions, shopping malls, and real estate developments is significant.

==Geography==

Dasmariñas is about . It is bounded by Imus and Bacoor to the north, Silang to the south, Muntinlupa and Las Piñas in Metro Manila to the northeast, General Mariano Alvarez, San Pedro in Laguna to the east, and General Trias to the west.

The city center, or the &quot;poblacion&quot;, is on the westernmost part of the city, Sabang, San Jose, Salawag and Salitran are in the north, San Agustin, Langkaan, and Sampaloc are in the south, Paliparan is on the easternmost part, while Burol and Bagong Bayan are in the middle, sandwiched between the Poblacion and Paliparan.

The city of Dasmariñas is landlocked. However, it is not too far from the coastal towns of Rosario, Kawit, Bacoor, Noveleta and Cavite City whose average distance from Poblacion is less than . It is about the same distance from Laguna de Bay and from the resort city of Tagaytay and the famous Taal Lake.

At present, Dasmariñas is served by corridors traversing the central areas which provide linkages to the Metropolitan Manila area core in the north and the developing nodes of Laguna and Batangas.

===Topography===

Dasmariñas is partly lowland and partly hilly. The Poblacion itself is elevated. From an elevation of at the Poblacion, the land rises to towards Silang. Generally, land near rivers and creeks are rugged. Dasmariñas is outside the typhoon belt and has no fault line constraints. Further, it is served by natural drainage system since it is traversed by several rivers and water tributaries draining to the Manila Bay. The city has not yet to experience floods.

Strongly sloping to elevated areas cover approximately or 18.61% of the total area. These are dispersed among Burol, Langkaan, Paliparan, Salawag, Sampaloc and San Agustin. Areas with slopes 10.1 to 18% cover about of land in portions of Salawag, Salitran, Burol, and other parts.

On the other hand, gently sloping or undulating areas comprise merely or 8.62% of the total land area while undulating areas with a slope of 2.6 to 5% account for the biggest percentage of 50.59% of the total land area equivalent to of land which are dispersed over the municipality except Sabang and San Jose.

===Climate===

Dasmariñas has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Aw&quot;) with two pronounced seasons: wet season and dry season. Wet season covers the period from May to December of each year and dry season covers the period from January to April.

==Demographics==
In the 2020 census, the population of Dasmariñas, was 703,141 people, with a density of .

From the original 643 inhabitants of the old Perez-Dasmariñas, the population grew and so did the town. By 1888, there were already more than 4,576 people living in Perez Dasmariñas. Gradually, the economic life of the people improved. The inquilinos (lessees) of the hacienda rose to become the middle class. Dasmariñas, 8,664 hectares were all farmed in 1890 except for 3,770 hectares (including parcels at Gatdula and Balimbing). Lessees paid the usual land rent base on the measurement of lowland and upland riceland set up by the &quot;uldog&quot; (friar administrator) of casa hacienda de Salitran. In the 1880s, there were 200 quinones of dry and 50 quinones of wet ricelands yielding some 2,300 cavanas of palay, 5,000 piculs of mucavado sugar, 50 cavans of corn and camote, 60 piculs of tao and 25 piculs of peanuts. Dasmariñas was a highly advanced town where not only textiles from Batangas and Bulacan looms, but also imported European cloth from Manila reached the town elites. Fish and other staple food however still came from nearby towns. Surprisingly until 1880, there was no public market in the town. There was a principal public dirt road in Perez-Dasmariñas that went to Silang which was passable to all kinds of vehicle only during dry season, but reachable only by foot and horseback during wet season. By 1870, mails from Manila were received at a central station in Cavite Puerto where it was sorted. Mails were brought via Kawit, then Imus then Dasmariñas.

Culturally, Perez-Dasmariñas was not too behind for by 1874 there were already two competing brass bands in the town. Don Valeriano Campos, an inquilino and a former gobernadorcillo of the town (1879 to 1881) organized one of the brass bands. He was popularly known as Capitang Vale. He was the highest taxpayer and owned a house made of cogon and wood on Calle Real with an appraised value of P300. His son Placido Campos learned his trade and also considered a man of means. Manuela Monzon, another well to do woman owned a house at the town&#x27;s main street. The house made of nipa and wood was valued at P200 and was rented as a boys&#x27; school for P72.

Nonetheless, in 1892, there was a noticeable decrease of the male population. As conflict between the friar-hacenderos, the inquilinos and casamas multiplied more people went into hiding in the deep forest of Perez-Dasmariñas. The rise of tulisanismo in Cavite was often connected with agrarian problems in the hacienda town owned by the friars.

The city has 75 barangays, has more than 180 subdivisions and the biggest resettlement area in the Philippines, the Dasmariñas Bagong Bayan (DBB).

Most affluent families from Metro Manila and nearby towns and provinces have chosen Dasmariñas to be their home due to its proximity to the National Capital Region. The mass exodus of people here in Dasmariñas is also brought about by the industrial boom which brought about more jobs. There are also a big number of foreign residents such as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Americans, Hindus, Britons and Eurasians. Because of this, Dasmariñas can be also considered as the &quot;Melting Pot&quot; of Cavite.

===Religion===

Christianity is the predominant faith, composed of Roman Catholics, Protestants, and other independent Christian groups.

The City of Dasmariñas is divided into eleven unofficially-defined administrative districts and is subdivided into 75 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

====Poblacion====

====San Agustin====

Kasuyan is its first name of this place, during the Spanish period, because of the presence of many cashew trees on the area. After many years, its name became Luksuhin and on July 18, 1889, it was renamed again by the petition passed by Don Juan Bautista requesting the place be named after San Agustin. The place is lying between the Poblacion and Sampaloc in the north. Here, vast lands with big mango trees can be found. There was a continuous flow of water coming from Bucal to the Poblacion during the Spanish period which they call Simbro. On December 17, 1944, three persons living here were killed at the sona (zonification) in the Poblacion. They were Conrado Aledia, Primitivo Sango and Matiaga Ramirez. 
Farming was the chief source of income of people living here. San Agustin is blessed with rich soil that can be planted with rice, fruits, sugarcane and vegetables. However, most lands are now being converted into subdivisions and other commercial establishments.

Today, the place is on development. The business establishments located here are the Vista Mall Dasmariñas, Kia Motors Dasmariñas, JAC Motors Dasmariñas and Nissan Dasmariñas.

====San Jose====

This barangay is situated between the Poblacion and Sabang. On April 13, 1889, a petition was passed appealing the sitio, once known Sitio Tamban, to be transformed into a barangay. The place was renamed on July 18, 1889, and was given the name San Jose in commemoration of their patron saint, St. Joseph. Cumpuerta is the name of the hide-out of the Filipino revolucionarios during the revolution against Spain. This is a deep canal of flowing water which still exists until now. The families of Cantada, Villena, Reyes, Mendoza, Camañag, Ramos, and Pastor are the first ones who settled here.

Today there&#x27;s a lot of subdivisions and Schools situated in this area.

Only one barangay is located in this district, its namesake, Barangay San Jose.

====Salitran====

This place is known for the name &quot;Salitran&quot; even during the Spanish period. There are no exact historical accounts for the origin of the name. Some says that such name was given because the early settlers of this place were from Pampanga, Visayas, Tagalog region and some Chinese that served the Spanish friars. However, according to the original settlers here, the place was originally called &quot;Bayanan&quot;. They said that this has numerous big Spanish houses which is like in a small town. An old house in the eastern part of Salitran was used by the Spanish friars as the storage place for the rice and was called &quot;Makina&quot;. It was also used as a headquarters by the Guardia Civil. When the revolution ignited, the &quot;Makina&quot; became the center of attack by the revolucionarios from the Poblacion and this barrio. The friars weren&#x27;t aware of the said assault. On March 7, 1897, the Spanish went to Salitran where the Magdalo soldiers led by Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo hid. General Emilio Aguinaldo received help from one thousand men and formed a greater force and even the Spanish troops led by General Lechambre didn&#x27;t penetrate Salitran. Because of the rebelry, the Spanish burned all the houses and establishments in the barrio. There were only left three houses unburned. During the World War II, Simplicio Lara and Teodorico Timbang were killed by the Japanese soldiers.
Now, Salitran is on vast development due to the presence of numerous subdivisions and villages. Schools located here are West Hill Academy, Colegio De Salitran, St. Jude College, The Immaculate Conception Academy-North Campus, and many others. There are also many business establishments here such as Central Mall Dasmariñas, Toyota Dasmariñas, Mitsubishi Dasmariñas, Hyundai Dasmariñas, Suzuki Dasmariñas, Honda Dasmariñas and Easy Shop.

====Sabang====

On the northern part of Dasmariñas is where this barangay can be traveled and found. The word &quot;Sabang&quot; means &quot;to overflow&quot;, wherein the creeks running from Malagasang, Imus tend to inundate in this place. This were made by the Spanish friars to irrigate the vast rice fields of the barangay. The diversion in the direction of the water flow had vastly made changes in the agriculture during the Spanish period, for there was a rich production of rice corps. Because of this, a bodega was made here for the storage of rice and was called the &quot;Kamalig ng Pare&quot; (Silo of the Priest). This place is considered to be the richest land in Dasmariñas. Residents here were known to be industrious. Agriculture is still a source of income in this barangay, though it has diminished due to the development of its agrarian lands into subdivisions and schools for children. More than 85% of the population are professionals and have a high standard of living. In this place, the Madona Charity Clinic is located, owned by Mrs. Bracia Tengko. This clinic provides aid and relief to the less fortunate residents seeking medical help. At the back of the Madona Clinic was a Rock with a Spring of Water (Bucal ng Tubig) at the Ylang-Ylang River. It was believed to have healing properties or miracles. In 2007 LTO District Office Dasmariñas were established to accommodate the growing number of cars &amp; motors in the city.

====Burol====

On the eastern part of Dasmariñas, we can find Barangay Burol which is away from the city center. The complete name of barrio Burol is Pansol-Burol. Pansol is a Tagalog word meaning aqueduct, while Burol, also a native word, means mound. Even though there are no historical records about its establishment, it is safe to say that it was formed during the Spanish period due to the presence of ruins of old Spanish houses and sugarmills. The families of Quillao and Beltran are the first ones to settle in this place. This barangay became the hide-out of the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, there are some Dasmarineños who were killed in this place. They were Alfredo Purificacion, Pedro Calupad, Jose Yñota, Victor de Jesus and Angel Olaes.

====Langkaan====

This place is located on the south-western part of Dasmariñas. The name &quot;Langkaan&quot; came from the word &quot;langka&quot; meaning jackfruit; which is believed to be planted in many parts of this barangay during the 1900, the year of its foundation. Barangay Langkaan was a part of a vast hacienda during the Spanich period that&#x27;s why there are numerous water systems for ricefields that can be found here. The San Agustin Dam was constructed in 1855. On the last part of the 19th century, the Spaniards erected an indigo plantation here. The stone-made grinder of indigo still exists until now and it is the mark of the Spanish influence in the place. The Spaniards are the first ones who planted sugar canes and became the primary source of income during the 18th century. During those times, tarapiche and carabaos are used to make panucha and paldo. Don Placido Campos and Andres Medina are the ones who owned these tarapiche. When the Americans arrived, this place attracted residents from the Poblacion. The families Quillao, Bautista, Sarabusab, Reyes, Remulla, Sango, Laudato, Empeño, Satsatin, Medina, de Lima and others transferred here during those times. During the Second World War, the Japanese had a big plantation of cotton trees in Langkaan. Dasmarineños were forced to work here. A Japanese concentration camp was also established in this area.

<text>The International Genealogical Index (IGI) is a database of genealogical records, compiled from several sources, and maintained by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Originally created in 1969, the index was intended to help track the performance of temple ordinances for the deceased. 

The IGI contains free genealogical information, submitted from various sources including names and data for vicarious ordinances by Latter-day Saints (LDS) researchers, records obtained from contributors who are not members of the church, and data extracted from microfilmed birth or marriage records. The index contains millions of records of individuals who lived between 1500 and 1900, primarily in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe. Ongoing efforts are made to compile genealogical data from other regions and peoples.

The IGI contains many duplicate names, accumulated over time from many sources, and no real effort is made to validate the information. Many IGI records contain information on the submitter and date of submission (but only with the submitter&#x27;s consent). The IGI is available at FamilySearch, the LDS genealogy website. 

In 1995, after a major controversy, a deal was struck between the Jewish and LDS communities to &quot;Remove from the International Genealogical Index in the future the names of all deceased Jews who are so identified if they are known to be improperly included counter to Church policy.&quot; 

In 2008 The Vatican issued a statement directing its dioceses to block access to parish records from Mormons performing genealogical research.

<doc id="570045" wikidata="Q1143407" url="?curid=570045" title="Mini Marcos">
<text>The Mini Marcos is an automobile produced in limited numbers between 1965 and 1970 by Marcos, from 1974 to 1981 by D &amp; H Fibreglass Techniques Limited and again between 1991 and 1996 by Marcos. It was based on the DART design by Dizzy Addicott who finally sold the project to Jeremy Delmar-Morgan. Jeremy marketed the Mini DART as the Mini Jem. Jem Marsh of Marcos cars separately developed the project into the Mk I Mini Marcos and despite the similarity of the name, had nothing to do with the Mini Jem. In Sweden the Mini Marcos was sold by Elmhorn-Troberg Racing Service.

==Development==
The Marcos was sold as a kit car using a fibreglass/GRP Monocoque with running gear &amp; subframes from a Mini. During its life it went through five versions with changes including sliding windows (Mark II), which also had a modified front number plate holder. An optional rear hatch appeared with the Mark III and a standard rear hatch and wind-up windows for the Mark IV which also received somewhat longer and taller bodywork.

The Midas succeeded the Mk IV Mini Marcos which at that time was being made by D&amp;H Fibreglass Techniques Limited in Oldham, but the latter marque was subsequently revived by Marcos with the Mark V.

Following the closure of the Marcos company, the Mini Marcos moulds were acquired by Rory McMath of Marcos Heritage Spares who has re-launched the car as the Heritage Mk. VI and GT, the latter being a racing version.
==Motorsport==
The Mini Marcos was the only British car to finish (in 15th place) in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans: the drivers were Jean-Louis Marnat and Claude Ballot-Léna. The 1966 Le Mans car was used for several more races, then sold and finally stolen in Paris in October 1975. Many people searched for it, but it took until December 2016 to be found. Marcos entered a works car for the 24 Hours race of 1967 but the car fell out after just 13 laps.

It also set four British land speed class records. These are the flying mile, half mile, half kilometre and kilometre for cars up to 1600 cc.

==Australian production==
There were a few copies of the Mini Jem/Marcos built in Australia. John Taylor of Taylorspeed, in Adelaide, introduced the Taylorspeed Jem at a local show in 1968. The car was only sold as a kit and was made to accept any Mini internals. Most were heavily modified by their builders, and no two are alike. All in all only ten were built of the Mark I (with an oval bottomed rear window) and Mark II series (with a square rear window), of which one was sold in Singapore.

<doc id="570062" wikidata="Q8029906" url="?curid=570062" title="Wolf Szmuness">
<text>Wolf Szmuness (March 12, 1919 – June 6, 1982) was a Polish-born epidemiologist who immigrated to and worked in the United States. He conducted research at the New York Blood Center and, from 1973, he was director of the Center&#x27;s epidemiology laboratory. He designed and conducted the trials for the first vaccine to prove effective against hepatitis B.

==European beginnings==

Szmuness was born in Warsaw, Poland on 12 March 1919. He studied medicine in Italy, but he returned to be with his family around the Nazi German invasion of Poland in 1939. As the Germans and Soviets occupied Poland, Szmuness was separated from his family, who were later killed by the Germans. Trapped in the Communist-occupied part of Poland, Szmuness traveled eastward to escape the advancing Nazis. He asked the Soviets to let him fight the Germans but was sent to Siberia as a prisoner.

Following a year of hard labour in the prison camp, Szmuness was appointed head of sanitary conditions. He later became the head epidemiologist in the local district. After release from detention in 1946, Szmuness completed his medical education at the University of Tomsk in Siberia, and earned a degree in epidemiology from the University of Kharkiv.

Szmuness married a Russian woman, Maya, and in 1959 was allowed to return to Poland. There, he continued his education at the University of Lublin and worked as an epidemiologist in municipal and regional health departments.

Szmuness&#x27;s colleague Aaron Kellner reports that the Polish authorities granted Szmuness a vacation at a rest home, where he shared a room with a Catholic priest, Karol Wojtyła, and began a longtime correspondence with him. Karol Wojtyła would later become Pope John Paul II.

==Emigration and life in the United States==

In 1969, Szmuness, his wife and their daughter Helena were permitted to attend a scientific meeting in Italy. Upon arriving, Szmuness defected and immigrated to New York City in the United States for religious and political reasons. Through the intervention of Walsh McDermott, a professor of public health at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Szmuness was hired by the New York City Blood Center. Because doctors from abroad are not usually accredited in the United States, Szmuness began as a laboratory technician, but his skills were quickly recognized, and, within two years, Szmuness headed his own lab. A separate department of epidemiology at the Center was created for him, and he also became a full professor at the Columbia University School of Public Health. According to Aaron Kellner, President of the Center, within five years of arriving in New York, Szmuness became &quot;an international figure in epidemiology and the field of hepatitis&quot;.

Szmuness died of lung cancer in 1982.

== Hepatitis B ==

Szmuness first became interested in the hepatitis B virus when his wife, Maya, was nearly killed by the liver disease caused by the virus, which she contracted through a blood transfusion. In New York, Szmuness investigated the natural history of hepatitis B. A vaccine was produced in the late 1970s, and Szmuness designed and conducted vaccine trials to determine its efficacy. Over 1000 male homosexuals participated in the trials; they were chosen as participants because they &quot;had been found to have a risk of developing hepatitis B that is 10 times greater than that for the population in general&quot;.

==AIDS Theory==
A highly controversial theory suggested that HIV-contaminated Hepatitis B vaccine trials in 1978 were responsible for the original spread of AIDS in the United States by infecting gay men in New York City with HIV. Evidence as to the presence of HIV in Szmuness&#x27;s lab, or a mechanism for this introduction have not been offered, and scientific data strongly suggests that HIV instead first came to the United States with Haitian immigrants around 1969, many years prior to trials conducted on the Hepatitis B vaccine.

<doc id="570074" wikidata="Q548770" url="?curid=570074" title="Blur (Blur album)">
<text>Blur is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Blur, released on 10 February 1997 by Food Records. Blur had previously been broadly critical of American popular culture and their previous albums had become associated with the Britpop movement, particularly &quot;Parklife&quot;, which had helped them become one of Britain&#x27;s leading pop acts. After their previous album, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, the band faced media backlash and relationships between the members became strained.

Under the suggestion of the band&#x27;s guitarist, Graham Coxon, the band underwent a stylistic change, becoming influenced by American indie rock bands such as Pavement. Recording took place in London as well as in Reykjavík, Iceland. Drummer Dave Rowntree described the music on the album as being more aggressive and emotional than their previous work. Producer Stephen Street claimed that lead singer-songwriter Damon Albarn had started writing about more personal experiences while Coxon revealed that listening to his lyrics it was clear to him that &quot;he&#x27;d obviously gone off his head a bit more&quot;.

Despite worries from Blur&#x27;s label, EMI, and the music press that the change in style would alienate the band&#x27;s predominantly teenage fanbase and that the album would flop as a result, &quot;Blur&quot;, as well as lead single, &quot;Beetlebum&quot;, reached the top of the UK charts and the album was certified platinum. The album also reached the top 20 in six other countries. The success of &quot;Song 2&quot; led to &quot;Blur&quot; becoming the band&#x27;s most successful album in the US where the Britpop scene had been largely unsuccessful. The album received positive reviews from most music critics, many praising the stylistic change as well as Albarn&#x27;s songwriting. This is the last album to feature longtime producer Stephen Street, until his return for &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; (2015).

==Background==

Despite Blur&#x27;s previous album, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; being released to positive reviews, and entering the UK charts at number one, the album&#x27;s success was left in the shadows compared to &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; by Britpop rivals Oasis which went quadruple platinum in the US. Blur became perceived as an &quot;inauthentic middle class pop band&quot; in comparison to the &quot;working class heroes&quot; Oasis, which made lead singer-songwriter, Damon Albarn feel &quot;stupid and confused&quot;. Bassist Alex James later summarised, &quot;After being the People&#x27;s Hero, Damon was the People&#x27;s Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser—very publicly.&quot;

An early 1996 &quot;Q&quot; magazine interview revealed that relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them &quot;on the verge of a nervous breakup&quot;. Guitarist Graham Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates; James for his playboy lifestyle and Albarn for his control over Blur&#x27;s musical direction and public image. In February 1996, when Coxon and James were absent for a lip-synced Blur performance broadcast on Italian television, they were replaced by a cardboard cutout and a roadie, respectively. Blur biographer Stuart Maconie later wrote that, at the time, &quot;Blur were sewn together very awkwardly.&quot;

Coxon struggled with drinking problems and, in a rejection of the group&#x27;s former Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. In the 2010 documentary on the band, &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot;, Coxon stated that he was getting more influenced by American guitarists as &quot;a lot of them were doing very interesting stuff with guitars and I needed to be nourished. I suppose as a guitar player and there was none of that happening in English music although English music was now more popular [so] I started listening to more stuff from the States from smaller labels.&quot;

Although he had previously dismissed it, Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon&#x27;s tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur&#x27;s musical direction once again. &quot;I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you&#x27;ve got to move on&quot;, he said. He subsequently approached Street, and argued for a more stripped-down sound on the band&#x27;s next record. Coxon, recognising his own personal need to, as drummer Dave Rowntree put it, &quot;work this band&quot;, wrote a letter to Albarn, describing his desire for their music &quot;to scare people again&quot;.

==Recording==

Recording sessions for the album started in June 1996 at Mayfair studios in London. After the initial sessions, the band left to record the rest of the album in Reykjavík, Iceland, away from the Britpop scene. It was in Iceland that the vocals to &quot;Strange News from Another Star&quot;, &quot;Essex Dogs&quot;, &quot;Beetlebum&quot;, and &quot;On Your Own&quot; were recorded. &quot;We just recorded some vocals there,&quot; Albarn revealed in an &quot;Addicted to Noise&quot; interview. &quot;I have a house there and it&#x27;s the perfect place to write because of the light [The sun doesn&#x27;t rise until midday]. Not good during the summer because it&#x27;s sunshine all the time, 24 hours a day.&quot;

Apart from a change in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. &quot;It was the first time we sort of jammed,&quot; Coxon revealed. &quot;We&#x27;ve never really jammed before. We&#x27;ve been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did actually feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting.&quot; &quot;We just played together for two weeks in a way we hadn&#x27;t done since 1991,&quot; Dave recalls. &quot;We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output.&quot; According to producer Stephen Street, &quot;Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn&#x27;t going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I&#x27;d first worked with them.&quot; &quot;In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn&#x27;t want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together.&quot; Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as &quot;muso-ish to talk about but really useful&quot; that enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band&#x27;s jam sessions.

==Music==

Rowntree stated that the band decided to give Coxon a much freer hand on &quot;Blur&quot;. Street also observed a change of Albarn&#x27;s writing style, as he &quot;was much more prepared to write in the first person, rather than about interesting characters. I think [Albarn had] grown a bit and was prepared to start writing about his own experiences rather than transposing them on to a character like Tracy Jacks or Dan Abnormal.&quot; Coxon agreed, and felt &quot;Damon&#x27;s songs were revealing more to me than to him&quot; and said that when he heard some of his home demos he realised &quot;he&#x27;d obviously gone off his head a bit more&quot;. The album features the first song to appear on a studio album in which Coxon not only wrote the lyrics, but also sang lead vocal—&quot;You&#x27;re So Great&quot;.

According to Mark Redfern of &quot;Under the Radar&quot;, &quot;Blur&quot; eschewed Britpop in favour of American indie rock. &quot;NME&quot; magazine similarly argued that it favoured lo-fi and alternative rock over Britpop. By contrast, Margaret Moser of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; characterised its music as &quot;a punchy brand of muscular Brit-pop&quot;, while AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it &quot;may superficially appear to be a break from tradition&quot; but is a &quot;logical progression&quot; from Britpop rather than an abandonment of it. In congruence, music critic Jim DeRogatis assessed that the album &quot;introduced elements of American indie rock to the band’s veddy English sound.&quot;

Album opener &quot;Beetlebum&quot; has been described as a &quot;Beatles tribute&quot; by several publications; Erlewine wrote that the song &quot;[runs] through the &quot;White Album&quot; in the space of five minutes.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s Andrew Collins compared the song to The Auteurs as well as a &quot;slightly menacing Free as a Bird&quot;, due to &quot;a slight drone undulating in the foreground&quot; and a &quot;sweet, elongated coda busied by what sounds like an invasion of turkeys.&quot; Albarn admitted that &quot;Beetlebum&quot; was about heroin and the drug experiences he had with his then-girlfriend, Justine Frischmann of Elastica. Albarn also stated that the song describes a complicated emotion, sort of &quot;sleepy&quot; and sort of &quot;sexy&quot;. The song&#x27;s title alludes to the phrase &quot;chasing the beetle&quot;, a variation of the phrase, &quot;chasing the dragon&quot;, which refers to inhaling the smoke from heated heroin, morphine, or opium that has been placed on a piece of tin-foil. &quot;Song 2&quot; is notable for its hook which features Albarn yelling &quot;woo-hoo!&quot; The song&#x27;s intro has been called Coxon&#x27;s &quot;finest moment&quot;.


Erlewine described &quot;Country Sad Ballad Man&quot; as &quot;bizarrely affecting, strangled lo-fi psychedelia&quot;, whilst Collins claimed that &quot;the seated intro is a rustic mess from which arises a simply beautiful, lazy riff.&quot; &quot;M.O.R.&quot; was described by James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a homage to Mott the Hoople. The song borrows the chord progression from David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, the latter of which was co-written by Brian Eno. &quot;On Your Own&quot; is notable for its usage of a Roland TR-606 Drumatix, a 1980s drum machine. Erlewine described the song as &quot;an incredible slice of singalong pop spiked with winding, fluid guitar and synth eruptions.&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s a terrace singalong in here somewhere&quot;, Collins claimed, &quot;undermined by its indistinct drum sound&quot;.
&quot;Theme from Retro&quot; was described as &quot;obligatory space-rock trip-hop&quot; by &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, whilst Collins claimed that it &quot;presents Blur in dub&quot;, referring to it as &quot;an unyielding, lovely row. Like, say, a Blur B-side.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re So Great&quot;, performed only by Coxon, was described by Collins as &quot;the most American of all&quot; as &quot;[Coxon&#x27;s] voice – faraway badly recorded, wavering but heartfelt – belongs to anyone but Old Blur.&quot; Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the song as recalling the &quot;whacked-out plangency of Midwestern lo-fi heroes Guided By Voices&quot;.

Lindsay Zoladz&#x27;s review of the album (as part of &quot;Blur 21&quot;) for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; claimed that &quot;Death of a Party&quot; is the album&#x27;s highlight, speculating that it influenced Gorillaz – another musical project that features Albarn as the chief songwriter. Collins claimed that it sounded like Blur&#x27;s &quot;second homage&quot; to The Specials&#x27; &quot;Ghost Town&quot;, speculating that the lyrics, &quot;Why did we bother?/ Should&#x27;ve stayed away&quot; reflected Blur&#x27;s recent withdrawal from the public eye despite the song being written years before, and summarised the track as &quot;a genuinely creepy piece&quot;. Sinclair described &quot;Chinese Bombs&quot; as sounding like a &quot;Lower East Side mosh-pit den&quot;, while Zoladz felt that &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Killer for Your Love&quot; was &quot;exquisitely bleary-eyed&quot;. In &quot;Look Inside America&quot;, Albarn recalls the band waking up from a previous night&#x27;s show, swigging Pepsi to find the energy to do a local TV show. Hunter called the song a &quot;classic &#x27;90s road ballad&quot;. The song contains the refrain &quot;Look inside America, she&#x27;s all right; she&#x27;s all right,&quot; which was said by Erlewine to &quot;cleverly subvert the traditional Blur song, complete with strings.&quot; Collins described &quot;Strange News from Another Star&quot; as &quot;Blur&#x27;s Space Oddity&quot;, stating that the &quot;acoustic guitar, quiet intro, nutty mood-change into a darker passage [and] a melancholy report whose central thrust (&quot;I don&#x27;t believe in me&quot;) [express] further doubt from the troubled Albarn.&quot; Originally performed as a poem at the Albert Hall in July 1996, the studio version of &quot;Essex Dogs&quot; was described by Erlewine as a &quot;six-minute slab of free verse and rattling guitar noise.&quot; Collins revealed that &quot;here it&#x27;s set to a starter-motor riff so berserk even its author, Coxon, confesses to find it hard to listen to.&quot; Collins also described it as &quot;a fitting ending (all eight exploratory minutes of it) to a challenging, barbed masterwork.&quot; The song is followed by &quot;Interlude&quot;, a hidden track which was described by Collins as &quot;a distressed instrumental sign-oft that goes nowhere&quot;.

In a November 1996 video interview, Rowntree claimed, &quot;It&#x27;s a much more aggressive record in many ways as well as a more emotional record. I think the music we&#x27;re making now is the music that we&#x27;ve always wanted to make but got distracted from in a way.&quot;

==Artwork and packaging==
The artwork for &quot;Blur&quot;, as well the album&#x27;s associated singles, was designed by design company Yacht Associates, which consists of Chris Thomson and Richard Bull. The pair had also been involved in the design process for Blur&#x27;s previous album covers as part of Stylorouge. The cover art depicts a patient being rushed into an emergency ward. Searching for an image that conveyed &quot;both optimism and scariness&quot;, Yacht Associates chose the stock photo from Tony Stone Images, describing it as &quot;an anaesthetic dream&quot;. In &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, reviewer Mark Bennett speculates that the cover art represented the band&#x27;s critical status prior to the album.

The back cover and inside sleeve by Paul Postle depict sulphur fields in Iceland, where much of the album was recorded. Postle also took photos of the band rehearsing for the gatefold. &quot;Blur&quot; is also the group&#x27;s first album not to have lyrics printed in the liner notes, instead having a composite photo of the band in the studio spread out over three panels. When questioned on this decision, Albarn revealed they &quot;didn&#x27;t wanna have to go through explaining what the lyrics are about because they&#x27;re quite odd to explain,&quot; although he stated that &quot;&#x27;Death of a Party&#x27; and &#x27;Strange News From Another Star&#x27; are [both] pretty clear.&quot;

==Release and promotion==
The music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur&#x27;s fanbase. These fears were also shared by James who revealed that the front rows of the gigs that the band were performing at during the Britpop years were primarily attracting 15-year-old girls and that he thought the change in style was a &quot;fucking big balls move&quot;. Andy Ross, who was running Food Records at the time, admitted that when he first heard it he was &quot;taken aback. We&#x27;d won Brits, we&#x27;d won two consecutive Q magazine Albums of the Year and my initial reaction was it&#x27;s awkward and difficult. My immediate reaction was will you sell as many records? Where&#x27;s my royalties? Everyone&#x27;s first reaction to it was that it was a departure: that&#x27;s clear from the artwork onwards.&quot; Albarn dismissed EMI&#x27;s concerns, calling them &quot;The usual thing—&#x27;It&#x27;s got no singles on it&#x27;. Meanwhile, they&#x27;re giving Radiohead the full marketing works. That hurt for a while because we&#x27;ve done so well for them. We were trying to be really brave. But it was all made up pretty quickly.&quot; Parlophone MD Tony Wadsworth was enthusiastic however as Coxon recalls, &quot;We played him &quot;Song 2&quot; as a bit of a test of whether he was on our wavelength. We told him this was the second single. Course, we had no idea that it would be. He sat there, grinning—&#x27;Definitely! Definitely a single!&#x27;&quot;

Worries of &quot;commercial suicide&quot; were eased when the lead single, &quot;Beetlebum&quot;, debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Blur&quot; topped the UK Albums Chart when it was released in February, knocking &quot;White on Blonde&quot; by Texas off the top spot. &quot;Blur&quot; eventually went on to be certified Platinum. Although the album could not match the sales of their previous albums in the UK, &quot;Blur&quot; became the band&#x27;s most successful internationally, reaching the top twenty in Switzerland, France, and Norway. In the US, the album peaked at number sixty-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Blur&#x27;s highest-charting album at the time, and was certified gold. The album&#x27;s US success has been attributed partially to the popularity of &quot;Song 2&quot;, which peaked at number six on the Modern Rock chart. After &quot;Song 2&quot; was licensed for use in soundtracks, advertisements and television shows—it became the most-recognisable Blur song in the US. After the success of &quot;Blur&quot;, the band embarked on a nine-month world tour.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Blur&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics in the United States, but reviews were mixed in the UK press. &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised it, whereas &quot;The Times&quot; was more ambivalent and &quot;The Independent&quot; was negative. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the album highlights &quot;the band&#x27;s rich eclecticism and sense of songcraft. Certainly, they are trying for new sonic territory, bringing in shards of white noise, gurgling electronics, raw guitars, and druggy psychedelia, but these are just extensions of previously hidden elements of Blur&#x27;s music.&quot; Margaret Moser of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; praised the album for &quot;unveiling a punchy brand of muscular Brit-pop that dances around raucous, Kinks-like garage-pop (&quot;Movin&#x27; On,&quot; &quot;M.O.R.&quot;), tender, Beatles-like harmonies (&quot;Beetlebum,&quot; &quot;Look Inside America&quot;), punky quirk (&quot;Chinese Bombs&quot;), soulful balladry (&quot;Country Sad Ballad Man&quot;), obligatory space-rock trip-hop (&quot;Theme from Retro,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Killer for Your Love&quot;), and a raise-yer-mug singalong (&quot;On Your Own&quot;).&quot; Jonathan Bernstein of &quot;Spin&quot; also felt that, &quot;despite their traitorous pronouncements, Blur&#x27;s highlights are consistently British-bred.&quot; James Hunter, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, claimed that &quot;what still makes [Blur] great is their deep grasp of style and genre. What they haven&#x27;t done on &quot;Blur&quot; is roll out of bed, strum a few chords and loudly free-associate about the first thing that pops into their heads. This is a record that inhabits current American rock biases as cogently and intelligently as Parklife corralled the last few decades of British rock.&quot;

Many praised lyrics such as the ones in &quot;Look inside America/She&#x27;s alright&quot;, and noting Albarn&#x27;s &quot;obligatory nod to Beck, [and promotion of] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so&quot;, reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time—an about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years. Erlewine wrote that &quot;Blur might be self-consciously eclectic, but Blur are at their best when they are trying to live up to their own pretensions, because of Damon Albarn&#x27;s exceptional sense of songcraft and the band&#x27;s knack for detailed arrangements that flesh out the songs to their fullest.&quot; &quot;Alternative Press&quot; called it &quot;a whirl of weird esotericism, precious, precocious and impressively&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; was less enthusiastic and cited only &quot;Song 2&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;, indicating &quot;a good song on an album that isn&#x27;t worth your time or money&quot;. However, there was strong praise from the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, who awarded the album four out of four stars. Ed Masley wrote that &quot;you can hear the new infatuation with indie rock stylings all over the latest release, with its clattering sonic collages and transistor radio vocals. At times, it&#x27;s as though they&#x27;ve forgot that they&#x27;re British. They are British though. It&#x27;s what makes this eponymous record their greatest.&quot;

At the 1998 NME Awards, &quot;Blur&quot; received a nomination for Best Album. However, it lost to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 137 in its list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; writer Tom Doyle reflected that, with &quot;Blur&quot;, &quot;it appeared to have dawned on [the band] that as long as they had three or four decent singles, the remainder of an album could become a playground for their art rock imaginations&quot;, a development he said paved the way for &quot;13&quot; (1999).

Unlike some of Blur&#x27;s previous albums, praise from the band members has remained. &quot;I&#x27;m really fond of that record,&quot; Coxon said in 2009. &quot;I think it&#x27;s one of our best.&quot;

<text>BBC Radio Wiltshire is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the English county of Wiltshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at Prospect Place in Swindon.

According to RAJAR, the station had a weekly audience of 89,000 and a 6.2% share as of December 2023.

==History==
===BBC Wiltshire Sound (1989–2002)===
The station was launched as BBC Wiltshire Sound on 4 April 1989, with its main studios and headquarters in Prospect Place, Swindon. The station was not initially titled &#x27;BBC Radio Wiltshire&#x27; because at that time its competitor GWR owned the trademark of &#x27;Wiltshire&#x27; and &#x27;Radio&#x27; in whatever combination.

The first presenter heard on air was Paul Chantler. The early logo of the station featured the Westbury White Horse. BBC Wiltshire Sound had a reputation for solid local programming focusing on news and information.

From 1991 to 1994, the station&#x27;s Programme Editor was Mike Gray, who left to found the successful Kiss 102 and Kiss 105 radio stations in Manchester and Yorkshire. Amongst Gray&#x27;s innovations was giving 17-year-old Swindon student Mark Franklin his own programmes, which led to him being spotted and hired as a presenter on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Other specialist music presenters at the time included jazz singer Rosemary Squires.

One of BBC Wiltshire Sound&#x27;s best-known features was the long-running soap opera &quot;Acrebury&quot;, in which all the characters were voiced by presenter and actor Gerry Hughes, for which he was awarded a Guinness World Record. The city of Salisbury was given its own breakfast show for a time, due to its distance from Swindon. Both the Salisbury breakfast show and &quot;Acrebury&quot; were discontinued as part of a virtual relaunch of the station in 2000. Along with a number of presenter departures, the changes led to listener protests at the station&#x27;s headquarters and unflattering headlines in the local newspaper.

The 2000 relaunch gave listeners in Swindon separate programmes from the rest of the county, introduced in response to the rapid growth of the town and its new unitary authority status. New presenters brought in for the Swindon programmes included Dan Chisholm and Peter Heaton-Jones.

===BBC Radio Wiltshire and BBC Radio Swindon (2002–2008)===
On 11 November 2002, the separation was enhanced when the station was effectively split into two services: BBC Radio Swindon, covering the town and surrounding areas, and BBC Radio Wiltshire for the rest of the county. Originally the two stations had their own programmes for most of the day, but by 2007, following a number of schedule changes and presenter departures, only the breakfast shows remained separate, with all other programmes simulcast on both stations.

===BBC Wiltshire (2008–2020)===
On 21 April 2008, 19 years after the original launch, the two stations effectively merged again and became a single entity branded as BBC Wiltshire. This became the umbrella name for the radio station and online service, in common with branding policy across most of the BBC local radio network. Swindon initially retained its own breakfast show, for which the branding &quot;Swindon&#x27;s BBC Wiltshire&quot; was used. Currently all programmes across the week are broadcast on all BBC Wiltshire frequencies with no separate opt-outs.

===BBC Radio Wiltshire (2020–present)===
On 9 March 2020, the station reverted to BBC Radio Wiltshire again, in order to fit the station name in to the new jingle package. In the autumn of 2023, a series of schedule changes reduced local programming to just 8 hours a day on weekdays and a 4 hour afternoon sport show on Saturday.

==Technical==
BBC Radio Wiltshire broadcasts from its studios in Swindon on FM frequencies 103.5 (Newton Barrow, near A360, 5 miles northwest of Salisbury), 103.6 (Blunsdon, next to the A419, north of Swindon), 104.3 (Naish Hill, near A342, 4 miles west of Calne, for west Wiltshire), 104.9 (Marlborough, for east Wiltshire); on DAB; Freeview TV channel 713 in the BBC West and BBC South regions; and via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Swindon studios from 6am to 2pm on Mondays to Fridays. The afternoon programme is shared with BBC Radio Gloucestershire and the weekday evening shows (6pm to 10pm) are all broadcast across the BBC West area with the exception of sport programmes.

Weekend programmes from 6am to 2pm are shared regionally across the BBC West area. The breakfast show is presented from Gloucester with the brunch (10am to 2pm) show presented from Bristol. The Saturday afternoon sport programme (2pm to 6pm) broadcasts only to Wiltshire.

The Sunday afternoon programme (2pm to 6pm) is currently shared with, and broadcast from, BBC Radio Gloucestershire. The BBC intends to make this a national programme in the autumn of 2024.

The weekend 6pm to 10pm programmes on Saturdays are both broadcast across the BBC West area, with the Sunday evening programme in that timeslot being a national programme from London.

The late show, airing from 10pm to 1am, is a national programme originating in either Manchester or London.

BBC Radio Wiltshire simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live from 1am to 6am.

<text>BBC Radio Somerset is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the county of Somerset, England.

It broadcasts on FM, AM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios in the Blackbrook area of Taunton.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 55,000 listeners and a 7.2% share as of December 2023.

==History==
The first BBC service for the county of Somerset was established in 1978, as an emergency measure following storms in the county.

===BBC Somerset Sound (1988–2007)===
The station proper was launched as BBC Somerset Sound on 11 April 1988, broadcasting on BBC Radio Bristol&#x27;s former frequency of 1323 medium wave. It was based in studios above a café on Paul St, Taunton, run by producer-in-charge, Clinton Rogers and news 
producer Anne Ashworth, with a smaller satellite studio in Yeovil run by district producer, Steve Haigh. The signal on 1323 MW was for many years interfered with by a radio station in Russia.

In August 2002, BBC Somerset Sound moved to new premises in Park Street, Taunton, and acquired a more robust frequency of 1566 MW.

===BBC Somerset (2007–2020)===
In 2007, the station relaunched as BBC Somerset, with the launch of the BBC Somerset bus in May. On 3 December of that year, the station was given BBC Radio Bristol&#x27;s former frequency of 95.5 FM, and broadcasts to the whole county of Somerset (including the unitary districts of North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset) and beyond. Listeners from as far afield as Finland have reported hearing the station clearly. BBC Somerset sometimes uses its AM frequency for cricket commentary while regular programming continues on FM. BBC Somerset began broadcasting on DAB in September 2014.

BBC Somerset was for many years an &#x27;opt-out&#x27; from BBC Radio Bristol, but in May 2012, the BBC established it as a station in its own right. The BBC&#x27;s Annual Report and Accounts for 2005/2006 stated: &quot;The BBC is committed to extending its network of local radio stations to a limited number of under served areas, and BBC management is carrying out preparatory work for new stations in Somerset, Dorset and Cheshire&quot;.

On 6 October 2011, the BBC announced that it intended to close BBC Somerset&#x27;s 1566 MW frequency as part of its &quot;Delivering Quality First&quot; (DQF) programme of cutbacks. No decision on the timing of the medium wave switch-off has yet been made.

In November 2017, BBC Somerset moved from the Park Street premises to a new building on the edge of Taunton in Blackbrook.

The current editor of BBC Radio Somerset is Dean Poolman, with Andrew Enever as news editor.

===BBC Radio Somerset (2020–present)===
On 27 April 2020, the station changed its name to BBC Radio Somerset in order to fit the station name into the new jingle package.

On 5 July 2020, the station switched from the BBC West feed to join BBC South West.

In September 2023, the station joined again with BBC Radio Bristol sharing some programmes.

==Programming==
Local weekday programmes are produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Taunton studios from 6am to 2pm. The weekday afternoon programme is shared with BBC Radio Bristol. Evening weekday programmes are shared across the BBC West region. The 10pm to 1am Late Show is a programme broadcast across England and the Channel Islands from either London or Manchester.

Weekend 6am to 2pm programmes are broadcast across the BBC West region. Saturday sport (2pm to 6pm) is a shared programme with BBC Radio Bristol with the option to broadcast local commentaries. Saturday evenings are region wide shared programmes,

Sunday afternoons are shared with BBC Radio Bristol. After 6pm all programmes are national.

Overnight, BBC Radio Somerset simulcasts BBC Radio 5 Live between 1am and 6am.

==Technical==
The service is broadcast across Somerset on 95.5FM from the Mendip transmitting station located on the summit of Pen Hill, part of the Mendip Hills. The station also broadcasts on 1566kHz medium wave. 

BBC Radio Somerset broadcasts DAB from different transmitters, including Mendip, Taunton, Coker Hill, and Hutton. 

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 714 in the BBC South West and BBC West regions and streams online via BBC Sounds.

==The Challenge==
In 2007, BBC Somerset took part in an initiative to create the first carbon-zero radio station in the UK known as The Challenge.

Carbon auditors CO2balance analysed every aspect of the operation – from the mileage of the transport fleet down to what happens to the office tea bags.

At the time of the audit, the station generated more than 64 tonnes of CO2 each year. On hearing the results the staff voluntarily dipped into their pockets to fund the three main accredited methods of carbon offsetting – tree planting, sustainable projects and carbon trading. On average the cost to each member of staff was between £25 and £50, depending on their salary. Staff also looked at all areas where pollution is generated to reduce the station&#x27;s carbon footprint and make it more environmentally friendly. These included:

* The fleet of cars for reporters were swapped for fuel-efficient vans.
* Lighting systems were replaced with more energy-efficient ones.
* Loft insulation was improved and double glazing was considered.
* The electricity and paper supplies were checked to make sure they are eco-friendly.
* Water coolers were removed in favour of tap water.
* New recycling measures were introduced.
* Eco-friendly cleaning products were introduced.

*Claire Carter (Afternoons Mon-Thurs)
*Andy Bennett (Friday Afternoon and Weekend Daytimes)

Some of BBC Gàidhlig&#x27;s more notable programming includes the international issues magazine (&quot;Europe&quot;), children&#x27;s programme (&quot;What Now?&quot;) and comedy sketch show (&quot;Back on the Ran Dan&quot;). &quot;Dè a-nis?&quot; won the department an award at the Celtic Media Festival in 2009.

BBC Gàidhlig also produces programming to cover the Royal National Mòd. For instance, during the National Mòd in Caithness in 2010, BBC Gàidhlig produced daily programmes to cover the event, which were aired and repeated on BBC Alba, as well as being repeated on BBC Two Scotland.

==Radio==
BBC Gàidhlig is also responsible for the national Scottish Gaelic radio station BBC Radio nan Gàidheal. The station broadcasts across Scotland on FM, DAB digital radio, digital television and online. When it is not broadcasting Gaelic programming, it simulcasts BBC Radio Scotland.

==Online==
In July 2008, the BBC Alba website launched an extended news service to tie in with the launch of the digital television channel. Programmes from BBC Alba and Radio nan Gàidheal are also available online on BBC iPlayer.

<text>BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving the counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire, which were one county from 1974 to 1998.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and online via BBC Sounds from studios on Hylton Road in Worcester.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 90,000 listeners and a 7.8% share as of December 2023.

==History==

The concept for siting a local BBC Radio station within the, soon to be combined county of Hereford and Worcester, emerged as early as 1973 as part of the BBC&#x27;s evidence to the Crawford Committee on Broadcasting Coverage and reinforced in the BBC&#x27;s response to the Annan Report of 1977. However due to concerns about competition, and in particular a smaller than expected rise in the BBC&#x27;s license fee following the report, further local radio station ambitions were halted.

The station began broadcasting on 14 February 1989 (Valentine&#x27;s Day), and to mark the unusual, two-centre set-up for the radio station, the first record played was the song &quot;Two Hearts&quot; by Phil Collins. The original team of presenters included Graham Day (mid-morning), Gill Capewell (afternoons) and Allan Lee (drive). Other staff included Robert Piggott (now BBC Religious Affairs correspondent), TV journalist Liz MacKean and former LBC presenter Jeremy Dry.

When the station first began, Jane Garvey (of BBC Radio 5 Live) was one of the team of journalists. A few months later, she took over the Breakfast Show and went on to win a Sony Award with it.

It serves the rural communities across Herefordshire as well as the more populous Worcestershire with a range of programmes from news, sport, consumer, arts, religion, gardening, jazz, funk, northern soul and local music. Notable guests on the station have included the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in October 2016.

The station&#x27;s original studio based in Hereford (which supplemented the primary Worcester base) was used from the station&#x27;s launch in 1989, until the studio closed in December 2016, with the station occupying a temporary location in the city as they sought a more permanent home. This studio had been used for key programmes within the schedule, including the breakfast show during the early 2000s. The solution emerged in December 2020 when the station entered a collaboration with the Hereford College of Arts to base their Hereford studio within their College Road campus.

As a result of license fee freezes and associated budget cuts arising from the &quot;Delivering Quality First&quot; plan in 2011, programmes on BBC Local Radio stations began to be shared across regions in periods of lower demand such as evenings and medium wave transmitters began to be closed down where coverage matched FM and DAB transmissions. Following a further freeze in the license fee by the government in January 2022, the BBC announced further cuts to BBC Local Radio in October that same year, which will see weekday afternoon programmes shared with a neighbouring station and programming in the evenings, Saturdays and on Sunday mornings shared regionally with several stations.

==Technical==

BBC Hereford and Worcester transmits on FM. The original, and two strongest FM transmitters are on 104 FM (Great Malvern, serving Worcestershire) and 94.7 FM (Ridge Hill, between Ross On Wye and Ledbury near Much Marcle, serving Herefordshire). These signals are not particularly powerful, and have limited coverage outside the two counties, unlike stations such as BBC Radio WM. An additional FM transmitter on 104.6 FM improved coverage in the Kidderminster area and in February 2006, a new transmitter was turned on for Redditch (Headless Cross) on 104.4FM, as reception in the town had been unreliable.

From launch until 13 May 2021, BBC Hereford and Worcester broadcast on medium wave with the main AM transmitter on 738 kHz on the western edge of Worcester and covered most of the two counties. Originally, there was another AM transmitter for Hereford on 819 kHz; that frequency was given up to accommodate a new commercial station for south Shropshire. In 2003, a small transmitter on 1584 kHz at Woofferton, just south of Ludlow, was added to the station transferring from BBC Radio Shropshire.

The station started broadcasting on DAB in December 2013 with the new MuxCo Herefordshire and Worcestershire multiplex at the Bromsgrove, Ridge Hill and Malvern transmitter sites. This was extended in August 2016 with a further transmitter at Hereford and in September with another at Kidderminster.

On Freeview, the station is carried by the main transmitters at Ridge Hill, Sutton Coldfield and The Wrekin, and by their associated relays, covering a much larger area than FM or DAB. The station also streams online via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==
Until 2023, local programming was produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Worcester studios from 6 am to 10 pm each day, comprising a 6 am to 10 am breakfast show, 10 am to 2 pm morning show, 2 pm to 6 pm afternoon show and 6 pm to 10 pm evening show. The station&#x27;s programming which is exclusive to the station is now mainly broadcast between 6am and 2pm on weekdays. Programming outside of these times is mainly shared with some other stations or with one other station. These shows must contain at least 60% speech content within the core broadcast hours of 6 am to 7 pm, with full speech content during the breakfast peak of 7 am to 8:30 am. The station must also contain at least 95 hours of locally-made programming per week, that provides news, information and content relevant to the areas and communities it serves.

The station&#x27;s Saturday afternoon show is occupied by sports coverage under the &quot;BBC Hereford and Worcester Sport&quot; banner with &quot;The Sunday Gardening Show&quot; occupying the Sunday afternoon slot. On both weekend days, the evening slot is occupied by the BBC Music Introducing programme which features music from new and up and coming artists from the local area. The show helped discover and launch the careers of Ellie Goulding (whose first air-play was on the station), Becky Hill and 220 Kid.

The station&#x27;s late shows, airing from 10 pm to 1 am, originates from BBC Radio WM in Birmingham and is broadcast additionally to other BBC Local Radio stations in the West Midlands (BBC CWR, BBC Radio Stoke, BBC Radio Shropshire) and some nights of the week to stations in the East Midlands (BBC Radio Derby, BBC Radio Leicester and BBC Radio Nottingham).

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live between 1 am and 5 am and an early morning breakfast programme broadcast across the Local Radio network from BBC Radio London.

<doc id="570100" wikidata="Q372161" url="?curid=570100" title="Bajram Curri">
<text>Bajram Curri (16 January 1862 – 29 March 1925) was an Albanian chieftain, politician and activist who struggled for the independence of Albania, later struggling for Kosovo&#x27;s incorporation into it following the 1913 Treaty of London. He was posthumously given the title Hero of Albania.

== Early life ==
Bajram Curri was born in 1862 while his family was being sent to prison from Gjakova to Prizeren, pricesely in the village Krushë e Madhe. Most of the sources place year of birth as 1862, while more recent sources based on his recently discovered passport state 1866. His family originated in Krasniqi (present Tropojë), in the Highlands of Gjakova. At his birth, the Curri family was led to the Ottoman prison in Krushë e Madhe, Rahovec; his father Shaqir Aga had led a rebellion in Krasniq against the Ottomans due to heavy taxes and military recruitment, and had been interned by them. Shaqir Aga Curri was a trusted man of Abdullah Pasha Dreni of Gjakova, and apparently had become instrumental in tax-collection procedures and punishing expeditions of Pasha Dreni in the area. He aided Pasha Dreni during the Attack against Mehmed Ali Pasha, and was killed in the skirmish by the forces of the League of Prizren.

==Career==
Whilst the present-day regions of Albania were under Ottoman control, Curri represented the interests of the Albanians.

Between 1885 and 1886, he got into a feud with Riza Bey Gjakova that lasted for a decade and was only ended through an envoy sent by the sultan who conferred upon each man a military command and rank with Curri becoming a captain of the gendarmerie in Pristina. To govern, Sultan Abdulhamid II used patronage networks by awarding privileges and government positions to co opt local leaders such as Curri into the Ottoman system. In 1893 he participated in a revolt in Kosovo led by Haxhi Zeka, which was quickly suppressed by the Ottoman army. During 1899 he became a founding member of Zeka&#x27;s League of Peja. In 1906 he became one of the founders of the Gjakovë branch of the Secret Committee for the Liberation of Albania (Bashkimi Society) and an influential member.

Like some educated Albanians with nationalist sentiments of the time, Curri supported the unity of Albanians from different religions under the banner of Skanderbeg and was in favour of government reforms that benefited Albanians. During the Young Turk Revolution, Galib Bey managed to get Albanian leaders Curri, Nexhip Draga and Ferhat Draga to attend a meeting at Firzovik (modern Ferizaj) and use their influence to sway the crowd through fears of &quot;foreign intervention&quot; to support constitutional restoration. During the 31 March Incident, among the 15,000 volunteers assisting the larger Ottoman army, Curri, along with Çerçiz Topulli, mobilized 8,000 Albanians to put down the revolt in Istanbul. The repressive activities and broken promises of the Young Turks, however, led Curri to resume militant activities against the Ottoman authorities. In 1912, due to the deteriorating situation between Albanians and Ottoman authorities, Curri alongside other Albanian leaders were present at a meeting in Junik on 20 May where a besa (pledge) was given to wage war on the Young Turk government. He had an active role in the Albanian Revolt of 1912, fighting alongside Hasan Prishtina, Isa Boletini, Themistokli Gërmenji and others against the Turks. He was also one of the leaders in the Battle of Lumë against the Serbian military, which delayed their expansion to Albania and secured the Albanian independence. On August 18, the moderate faction led by Prishtina managed to convince Curri, and other leaders Idriz Seferi, Riza Bey Gjakova and Isa Boletini of the conservative group to accept the agreement with the Ottomans for Albanian sociopolitical and cultural rights. He successfully fought in 1912 against the Young Turks. During the 1912 uprising, while waiting for an Ottoman response to the demands of the rebels, Curri and other leaders of the rebellion ordered their forces to advance toward Üsküb (modern Skopje) which was captured during August 12–15.

During World War I, he organized a guerrilla unit as part of the Kachak movement through the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo which he was a member. On 20 October 1914, 1,000 Albanians, led by Bajram Curri, Isa Boletini, Bulgarian &quot;komitadjis&quot; and Austro-Hungarian officers, attacked a Montenegrin base near Gjakova, and took two hill artillery pieces with them. The Montenegrin army then surrounded and defeated them, and pushed them into Albanian territory.

In 1915 he became a founding member of the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo. This organization later established relations with the Comintern (which gave support for the self-determination of nations), with Curri later saying in December 1921 to the Soviet minister in Vienna that, &quot;The Albanian people await impatiently the determination of their frontiers not on the basis of brutal and bloody historical considerations, but rather on the basis of the situation which actually exists today. With the firm conviction that Soviet Russia will be able in the near future to determine the boundaries of Europe, especially in the Balkans, in a just manner, I pray that the great Soviet government will grant our just requests at that time.&quot;

Following the Congress of Lushnja in 1920 he became a minister without portfolio in the Albanian cabinet. In Albania&#x27;s politics he identified himself with the left-wing forces of Fan Noli against Ahmet Zogu. In December 1921 he became Minister of War in the unstable government of Hasan Prishtina, replacing Zogu. Within days, however, Zogu assembled his fellow Mati tribesmen and overthrew the government, forcing Prishtina, Curri and others to flee northwards. In March 1922 Curri and Prishtina began a revolt against Zogu which failed. The revolt was crushed, 8 March 1922, by the captain Prenk Pervizi, owing to the efforts of the British ambassador to Albania, Harry Eyres, who convinced one of the rebel commanders to surrender. Two years later, having stayed in the meantime in the mountains in order to evade Zogist forces, he issued the call to arms which began the Bourgeois-Democratic Revolution of June 1924 against Zogu.

Following the defeat of the revolution Curri continued his opposition to Zogu. On March 29, 1925, he was surrounded by Zogist troops while hiding in a cave near Dragobia. He was killed by his own friends so their lives could be spared by the zogist troops.

Years later in honor of Bajram Curri the town of Kolgecaj was renamed after him in 1952.

<doc id="570101" wikidata="Q186689" url="?curid=570101" title="13 (Blur album)">
<text>13 is the sixth studio album by the English alternative rock band Blur, released on 15 March 1999. Continuing the stylistic shift away from the Britpop sound of the band&#x27;s early career, &quot;13&quot; explores experimental, psychedelic and electronic music.

Recording took place from June to October 1998 in London and Reykjavík. The album marks a departure of the band&#x27;s longtime producer, Stephen Street, with his role being filled by William Orbit, who they had chosen after the release of the remix album, &quot;Bustin&#x27; + Dronin&#x27;&quot; (1998). Relationships between the band members were reported to be strained, with members frequently missing from the sessions. Lyrically, the album is significantly darker and more innovative than Blur&#x27;s previous efforts, being heavily inspired by Damon Albarn&#x27;s breakup with long-term girlfriend, Justine Frischmann, which followed an increasingly strained relationship. This album was the last for over a decade to feature the original line-up as Coxon left the band during the 2002 sessions of their next album &quot;Think Tank&quot; (2003), before returning for &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; (2015).

&quot;13&quot; was released on 15 March 1999 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, making it Blur&#x27;s fourth consecutive studio album to reach the top spot. The album was later certified Platinum. &quot;13&quot; also reached number one in Norway and charted within the top 20 in many other countries. The album produced three singles – &quot;Tender&quot;, &quot;Coffee &amp; TV&quot; and &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot; – which charted at number 2, number 11 and number 14 respectively on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;13&quot; met with favourable reviews and received a nomination for the Mercury Prize, as well as for Best Album at the 2000 NME Awards.

==Background==
Blur&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;Blur&quot; (1997), had seen the band move away from the Britpop movement and take on a more alternative rock-influenced direction, primarily under the suggestion of guitarist Graham Coxon. The press and the industry had feared that the change in style would not be taken well with the public, and therefore the album would be commercially unsuccessful as a result. Despite these concerns, &quot;Blur&quot; was an unexpected success, particularly in America, where the album was certified gold. However, the band still wanted to innovate, so they decided to embrace a different sound. Bassist Alex James stated, &quot;I think you just have to keep changing. That sort of thinking was, sort of, key.&quot;

The band&#x27;s leader Damon Albarn had been in a long-term relationship with Justine Frischmann, of the Britpop band Elastica. Their relationship was highly publicised, the couple being described by John Harris as &quot;proto-Posh and Becks for the indie-rock constituency.&quot; However, their relationship became strained over time, stated reasons including Albarn&#x27;s desire to have children as well as Frischmann&#x27;s continued friendship with ex-boyfriend Brett Anderson of Suede, who had shared a musical rivalry with Albarn. Albarn&#x27;s lyrics and attitude had reflected this in the eyes of the other band members, with Coxon pointing out, &quot;I didn&#x27;t have much of a clue that things were going wrong between Damon and Justine but it was probably easy to guess.&quot; After one last holiday together in Bali in late 1997 in an attempt to rekindle their relationship, the couple finally split. Albarn later commented, &quot;That relationship just absolutely crashed. I mean, it really was a spectacularly sad end.&quot;

After his breakup, Albarn started sharing a flat with artist Jamie Hewlett whom he had met through Coxon. Around this time, Albarn had started to broaden his musical output. Whilst he was working on &quot;13&quot;, there were various reports that he and Hewlett were working on a secret project, which turned out to be Gorillaz, a virtual band. Albarn also started working on film soundtracks, including &quot;Ravenous&quot;, &quot;Ordinary Decent Criminal&quot; and &quot;101 Reykjavík&quot;.

==Recording==
&quot;13&quot; is Blur&#x27;s first album without longtime producer Stephen Street. Instead the band &quot;unanimously&quot; decided that they wanted electronic music artist William Orbit to produce the album after being impressed by his remix of their track, &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;, included on the remix compilation, &quot;Bustin&#x27; + Dronin&#x27;&quot; (1998). Albarn commented that &quot;it was such a personal thing going on, we needed to have someone who didn&#x27;t really know us&quot;. He also described Orbit as being &quot;like a psychiatrist&quot;. When asked if his replacement had come as a shock, Street stated, &quot;I just think they wanted to stretch out a bit more and, having made five albums with me, the best way to do that was to work with someone different who would approach the project in a different way. I understand that perfectly and certainly wasn&#x27;t offended. I did five albums with the band and I must admit I thought each one would be the last because they were bound to want to try something new.&quot; Albarn described the decision to not work with Street as &quot;difficult&quot;, going on to say &quot;he&#x27;ll be forever part of what we are, and ironically, he gave us the tools we needed to go it alone.&quot;

Tension in the studio ran high during the recording sessions. In Orbit&#x27;s words, &quot;There was a battle between Damon&#x27;s more experimental direction, and Graham&#x27;s punk one, and Graham prevailed. If that tension had been growing on previous LPs, it came to a head here.&quot; &quot;Things were starting to fall apart between the four of us,&quot; drummer Dave Rowntree later revealed. &quot;It was quite a sad process making it. People were not turning up to the sessions, or turning up drunk, being abusive and storming off.&quot; &quot;I had songs,&quot; Alex James remarked. &quot;I played them to William. He liked them. But I was sulking. I didn&#x27;t play them to the others... Now I know how George Harrison felt.&quot; Coxon admitted, &quot;I was really out there around &quot;13&quot;, which made for some pretty great noise but I was probably a bit of a crap to be around.&quot;

&quot;1992&quot; had originally been recorded as a demo in 1992 and was lost until Albarn found it again on a tape six years later. &quot;Mellow Song&quot; was demoed as a jam session known as &quot;Mellow Jam&quot; that was later included as the B-side of &quot;Tender&quot;.

==Musical style and composition==
&quot;13&quot; sees the band moving further away from their Britpop past into more cerebral and denser musical territory. Some of the songs, however, are evocative of songs from their previous efforts, such as &quot;Bugman&quot;, &quot;Coffee &amp; TV&quot; and &quot;1992&quot;. &quot;Bugman&quot; has an industrial rock sound. The instrumental closer &quot;Optigan 1&quot; was created using an Optigan optical organ. The album is in the style of a loose concept album, much like other Blur albums, in this case about life and relationships. Much of the album was inspired by Albarn&#x27;s breakup with Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. Two of the singles, &quot;Tender&quot; and &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot;, describe Albarn&#x27;s love for Frischmann and his struggle to move on. The album features several short hidden tracks at the end of songs, stretching the playing time out; examples of this are &quot;Coffee &amp; TV&quot;, &quot;B.L.U.R.E.M.I.&quot;, &quot;Battle&quot; and &quot;Caramel&quot;, the latter of which features two hidden tracks. The album is named after the band&#x27;s recording studio as well as the number of tracks on the album (bar the hidden tracks).

==Artwork==
The cover is a portion of an oil painting by Graham Coxon called &quot;Apprentice&quot;. The album&#x27;s singles also have cover art by Coxon. The numbers 1 and 3 have been painted so they also form the letter &quot;B&quot; – revealed on the back cover to be for &quot;Blur&quot;. This was not present on the original &quot;Apprentice&quot;, nor was the &quot;shine&quot; on the figure&#x27;s head, which appears on &quot;13&quot;. These additions were made long after the original &quot;Apprentice&quot;, which was painted in 1996. The band&#x27;s logo does not appear on the album in any form, aside from a sticker on the CD packaging. The logo is also absent from the single covers.

==Release and reception==

&quot;13&quot; holds an overall approval rating of 79 out of 100 on online review aggregator Metacritic based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Tom Doyle of &quot;Q&quot; called &quot;13&quot; &quot;a dense, fascinating, idiosyncratic and accomplished art rock album&quot;, while an enthusiastic Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; stated that &quot;Blur have finally found a sound to match their name.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Sarah Zupko praised Blur&#x27;s new musical approach and wrote that &quot;proving they have the goods of a truly exceptional band, Blur has done what the greats have done before them—evolved.&quot; Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;their sloppiest, most playful set, spiking the mix with church organ, electric piano and shambling drum loops.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot;″s Jason Draper described &quot;13&quot; as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; that stands as arguably the band&#x27;s &quot;greatest work&quot;.

In a more mixed assessment, Heather Phares of AllMusic felt that &quot;the group&#x27;s ambitions to expand their musical and emotional horizons result in a half-baked baker&#x27;s dozen of songs, featuring some of their most creative peaks and self-indulgent valleys.&quot; Keith Cameron of &quot;NME&quot; concluded that &quot;13&quot; was &quot;Blur&#x27;s most inconsistent and infuriating statement thus far. Infuriating, because divested of four solid-gone clunkers &quot;13&quot; could pass muster as the best of Blur.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honourable mention rating, indicating &quot;an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure&quot;, and remarked that &quot;halfway there, it sits down in the middle of the road and won&#x27;t budge.&quot;

The music video for the hit single &quot;Coffee &amp; TV&quot; cemented Blur&#x27;s reputation as a cult band in the US with its protagonist Milky. The video gained heavy airplay on many modern rock channels in America.

==Accolades==
&quot;13&quot; was nominated in the Album of the Year category at the 2000 NME Awards, losing to &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; by The Flaming Lips. &quot;13&quot; was also nominated for the 1999 Mercury Prize, being Blur&#x27;s second album to receive a nomination. The award was eventually given to Talvin Singh for &quot;OK&quot;.

The album is ranked number 773 in &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (3rd edition, 2000).
