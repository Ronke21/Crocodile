<text>Monique Andrée Serf (9 June 1930 – 24 November 1997), known as Barbara, was a French singer. She took her stage name from her grandmother, Varvara Brodsky, a native of Odesa, Ukraine. Barbara became a famous cabaretière in the late 1950s in Paris, known as (&#x27;the midnight singer&#x27;), before she started composing her own tracks, which brought her to fame. Her most famous songs include &quot;Dis, quand reviendras-tu ?&quot; (1962), &quot;Ma plus belle histoire d&#x27;amour&quot; (1966) and &quot;L&#x27;Aigle noir&quot; (1970), the latter of which is said to have sold over 1 million copies in just twelve hours.

==Childhood==
Born on Rue Brochant in Paris to a Jewish family, Barbara lived in northwestern Paris as a child. She then lived in Roanne from 1938 and Tarbes from 1941. Barbara was 13 years old when she had to go into hiding during the German occupation of France in World War II. Her family was hidden by the family of conductor Jean-Paul Penin from 1943 to 1945, first in Préaux and then in Saint-Marcellin.

After the war ended, Barbara&#x27;s family came back to Paris in 1946, on Rue Vitruve in the 20th arrondissement. Her childhood dream was to become a pianist, but a problem with her hand made such a career impossible. To console her, her parents agreed to pay for singing lessons. A neighbourhood music professor, who heard her sing, took an interest in helping her develop her talents. She was given vocal lessons and taught to minimally play the piano; eventually she enrolled at the École Supérieure de Musique in 1947. Money was a problem and she gave up her musical studies in 1948. She was first recruited at the Théâtre Mogador, before a stint in Belgium, where she performed under the stage name Barbara Brodi. Late 1951, she returned to Paris to audition at La Fontaine des Quatre Saisons, a popular cabaret in the 7th arrondissement. However, as she failed to become a permanent cast member, she returned to Brussels. In 1955, she returned to Paris; with more luck, she began to sing at various cabarets throughout the capital, with a growing audience.

She was deeply scarred by the war and her family&#x27;s plight. The feelings of emptiness experienced during childhood showed in her songs, particularly &quot;Mon Enfance&quot;. She said in her uncompleted autobiography, (assembled from notes found after her death), that her father sexually abused her when she was 10 and she hated him for that. He later abandoned the family.

==Musical development==

A tall person, Barbara dressed in black as she sang melancholy songs of lost love. From 1950 to 1951, after her father&#x27;s desertion of her family, she lived in Brussels, where she became part of an active artistic community, before visiting Charleroi, where she befriended many artists. Her painter and writer friends took over an old house, converting it into workshops and a concert hall with a piano where she performed the songs of Édith Piaf, Juliette Gréco and Germaine Montero. However, her career evolved slowly and she struggled constantly to eke out a living.

Returning to Paris, she met Jacques Brel and became a lifelong friend, singing many of his songs. Later she met Georges Brassens, whose songs she began to use in her act and to record on her first album. In the 1950s, she sang at some of the smaller clubs and began building a fan base, particularly with the young students from the Latin Quarter. In 1957, she went back to Brussels to record her first single, but it was not until 1961 that she got a real break when she sang at the Bobino Music-Hall in Montparnasse. Dressed in a long black robe, she gave a haunting performance, but the Parisian critics said she lacked naturalness and was stiff and formal in her presentation. She continued to perform at small clubs, and two years later at the Théâtre des Capucines she succeeded with the audience and critics alike, singing new material she had written herself. From that point on, her career blossomed and she signed a major recording contract in 1964 with Philips Records.

==Musical influences==
Influenced originally by songwriters Mireille and Pierre MacOrlan, she developed her own style and the writing of her own songs transformed her image into that of a unique singer-songwriter. In the 1960s, she wrote her landmark song, &quot;Ma plus belle histoire d&#x27;amour c&#x27;est vous&quot; (&quot;My Most Beautiful Love Story Is You&quot;), and others for which she remains famous such as &quot;&quot;L&#x27;aigle noir&quot;, &quot;Nantes&quot;, &quot;La solitude&quot;, &quot;Göttingen&quot; and &quot;Une petite cantate&quot;.&quot; These five songs plus &quot;&quot;Dis, quand reviendras-tu&quot;?&quot; were translated into German by Belgian-German singer-songwriter Didier Caesar. The song &quot;Göttingen&quot; (named after the German city of Göttingen) is said to have contributed more to post-war German–French reconciliation than any speech by a politician. On the 40th anniversary of the Elysée agreement, ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder quoted from the song in his official speech in the Château de Versailles.

==Middle years==
She returned to Bobino in 1964 for several sold-out performances. She performed at the Paris Olympia and other important venues in France, becoming one of her country&#x27;s most beloved stars. In 1964, she released the album &quot;Barbara chante Barbara&quot;, which became a critical and financial success, winning in 1965 the Grand Prix du Disque of the Charles Cros Academy. At the award ceremony, Barbara tore her award into several pieces, giving a piece to each of her technicians as a sign of her gratitude.

==Acting career==
In 1969, Moustaki wrote the theme song &quot;Moi, je me balance&quot; for the film &quot;La fiancée du pirate&quot; that Barbara sings. She announced that she would limit her concert singing, and in 1970 she made her acting début in the stage play &quot;Madame&quot; that proved to be a commercial flop. In 1971, she co-starred with Jacques Brel in a film he directed titled &quot;Franz&quot;. Two years later she starred in &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau rare&quot; directed by Jean-Claude Brialy. Her final film role came in 1975 in &quot;Je suis né à Venise&quot; by choreographer Maurice Béjart. 

==Later years and death==
In the 1970s, Barbara made appearances on television variety shows with stars such as Johnny Hallyday and a tour of Japan, Canada, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Through the 1980s, she continued to tour and to write songs; her album &quot;Seule&quot; was one of France&#x27;s top grossing releases of 1981. The next year she was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque in recognition of her contribution to French culture. She developed a close working relationship with rising film star Gérard Depardieu and his wife Élisabeth, collaborating on songs for film and records. In 1986, she went to New York City to perform on piano at the Metropolitan Opera with Mikhail Baryshnikov in a song and dance ballet presentation. She co-wrote the music for the stage play &quot;Lily Passion&quot; with Luc Plamondon, in which she co-starred with Depardieu. It told the story of a killer who murders someone each time he hears her sing.

In the latter part of the 1980s, she became active in the fight against AIDS. She recorded &quot;SID&#x27;Amour à mort&quot; and gave out condoms at performances. In 1988 the government of France awarded her the Legion of Honour. Health problems impeded her performing and she began to devote time to the writing of her memoirs. However, she recorded another successful album in 1996—which sold over a million copies in twelve hours—before she died of respiratory problems in Neuilly-sur-Seine (a suburb of Paris), on 24 November 1997. She was interred in the family grave at the Cimetière de Bagneux in southwest Paris.

The Paris Métro station &quot;Barbara&quot;, named in her honour and situated near her gravesite, was opened 13 January 2022, on a southern extension of Line 4.

==Personal life==
In October 1953, she married Claude John Luc Sluys, a Belgian law student, but they separated in 1956. She wrote many very personal songs, including &quot;Nantes&quot; about her father and &quot;Une petite cantate&quot;, which was dedicated to her friend , who had died in a car accident earlier in 1965. Later in life, she wrote a song to her public – &quot;Ma plus belle histoire d&#x27;amour&quot; – and another about her musicians – &quot;Mes hommes&quot;.

==Musical legacy==
Barbara&#x27;s musical legacy is revealed in the writing of a number of singers, French-speaking and otherwise. A style referred to as &quot;Nouvelle Chanson&quot;, or &quot;New Chanson&quot;, artists such as Keren Ann, Benjamin Biolay, Coralie Clement, Emilie Simon, Daphné, Vincent Delerm and Tancrède are often cited as exponents of the updated style. One of the few English-speaking artists to cover her work is Marc Almond, whose version of &quot;Amours Incestueuses&quot; (&quot;Incestuous Loves&quot;) was released on his 1993 album &quot;Absinthe&quot;. The Anglo-French biographer David Bret, a close friend of Barbara, wrote at her behest &quot;Les Hommes Bafoués&quot;, a song about AIDS prejudice. Bret also adapted three of her songs, &quot;Ma Plus Belle Histoire D&#x27;Amour&quot;, &quot;La Solitude&quot;, and &quot;Précy Jardin&quot; into English for Barbara. These were taped in 1992, but so far have never been released. In 1971, the Spanish singer Maria del Mar Bonet recorded a cover of L&#x27;Aigle Noir in Catalan which was a success in Spanish-language countries. L&#x27;Aigle Noir has also been adapted and sung in Spanish, and Swedish (Rikard Wolff), and many times in Japanese, also with great success.

Well-known contemporary artists such as New York-based Martha Wainwright and Spanish singer-songwriter Conchita Mendivil (who both recently reprised &quot;Dis, Quand Reviendras-tu?&quot;,), and London-based singer-songwriter Ana Silvera have reprised songs sung by Barbara.

<doc id="562629" wikidata="Q730045" url="?curid=562629" title="Sanjay Gandhi">
<text>Sanjay Gandhi (14 December 1946 – 23 June 1980) was an Indian politician. He was a member of the Lok Sabha and was the younger son of Indira Gandhi and Feroze Gandhi.

During his lifetime, he was widely expected to succeed his mother as head of the Indian National Congress and Prime Minister of India, but following his death in a plane crash, his elder brother Rajiv became their mother&#x27;s political heir and succeeded her as Prime Minister of India and President of the party after her assassination. His wife Maneka Gandhi and son Varun Gandhi are politicians in the Bharatiya Janata Party.

==Early life and education==

Gandhi was born in New Delhi, on 14 December 1946, as the younger son of Indira Gandhi and Feroze Gandhi. Like his elder brother Rajiv, Gandhi was educated at St. Columba&#x27;s School, Delhi, Welham Boys&#x27; School, Dehra Dun and then at the Doon School, Dehra Dun. Gandhi was also educated at the Ecole D&#x27;Humanité, an international boarding school in Switzerland. Gandhi did not attend university, but took up automotive engineering as a career and underwent an apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce in Crewe, England for three years. He was very interested in sports cars. In 1976, he obtained a pilot&#x27;s licence and won several prizes in aerobatics. 

==Maruti Limited controversy==
In 1971, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s cabinet proposed producing an affordable, locally made car for India&#x27;s middle class. In June 1971, a company known as Maruti Motors Limited (now Maruti Suzuki) was incorporated under the Companies Act, and Sanjay Gandhi became its managing director despite having no previous experience, design proposals, or links with any corporation. Indira Gandhi faced criticism, but the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War shifted public focus. The company did not produce any vehicles during his lifetime. A test model put out as a showpiece to demonstrate progress was criticised. Public perception turned against Gandhi, and many began to speculate about growing corruption. Gandhi then contacted Volkswagen AG from West Germany for a possible collaboration, transfer of technology and joint production of the Indian version of the &quot;People&#x27;s Car&quot;, to emulate Volkswagen&#x27;s worldwide success with the Beetle. During the emergency, Gandhi became active in politics and the Maruti project went on the back burner. There were accusations of nepotism and corruption. Finally, the Janata Government came to power in 1977 and &quot;Maruti Limited&quot; was liquidated. A commission was set up by the new government headed by Justice Alak Chandra Gupta which gave very critical report of the Maruti affair. A year after his death in 1980, and at the behest of Indira, the Union government salvaged Maruti Limited and started looking for an active collaborator for a new company. Maruti Udyog Ltd. was incorporated in the same year through the efforts of Nehru Gandhi family friend and industrial doyen V. Krishnamurthy. The Japanese company Suzuki was also contacted to present the design and feasibility of their car to be manufactured in India. When Suzuki learned that the Government of India had contacted Volkswagen as well, it did everything to pip the German company in the race to produce India&#x27;s first People&#x27;s Car (Maruti 800). It provided the government a feasible Design of their &#x27;Model 796&#x27;, which was also successful in Japan and East Asian countries.

==Role during Emergency==
In 1974, the opposition-led protests and strikes had caused a widespread disturbance in many parts of the country and badly affected the government and the economy. On 25 June 1975 following an adverse court decision against her, Indira Gandhi declared a national emergency, decorated elections, censored the press and suspended some constitutional freedoms for national security purpose. Non-Congress governments throughout the country were dismissed. Thousands of people, including several freedom fighters like Jaya Prakash Narayan and Jivatram Kripalani who were against the Emergency were arrested.

In the extremely hostile political environment just before and soon after the Emergency, Gandhi rose in importance as Indira&#x27;s adviser. With the defections of former loyalists, Gandhi&#x27;s influence with Indira and the government increased dramatically, although he was never in an official or elected position. According to Mark Tully, &quot;His inexperience did not stop him from using the power his mother, Indira, had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state.&quot;

It was said that during the Emergency, he virtually ran India along with his friends, especially Bansi Lal. It was also quipped that Gandhi had total control over his mother and that the government was run by the PMH (Prime Minister House) rather than the PMO (Prime Minister Office). He &quot;recruited into the party thousands of younger people, who used threats and force to intimidate rivals and those who opposed Mrs Gandhi&#x27;s authority or his own.&quot;

During the emergency, Indira declared a 20-point economic programme for development. Sanjay also declared his own much shorter five points programme promoting:
* Literacy
* Family planning
*Tree Planting
* Eradication of Casteism 
* Abolition of dowry 
Later during the emergency Sanjay&#x27;s programme was merged with Indira&#x27;s 20-point programme to make a combined twenty-five point programme.

Out of the five points, Sanjay is now chiefly remembered for the family planning initiative that attracted much notoriety and caused longterm harm to population control in India.

===Involvement in politics and government===
Although he had not been elected and held no office, Sanjay began exercising his newfound influence with Cabinet ministers, high-level government officials and police officers. While many Cabinet ministers and officials resigned in protest, Sanjay reportedly appointed their successors.

In one famous example, Inder Kumar Gujral resigned from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting when Sanjay attempted to direct the affairs of his ministry and give him orders. Gujral is reported to have angrily rebuked Sanjay and refused to take orders from an unelected person. Gujral was replaced by Vidya Charan Shukla, a Sanjay Gandhi acolyte. In another incident, after popular Bollywood singer Kishore Kumar refused to sing at a function of the Indian Youth Congress, his songs were banned on All India Radio upon Gandhi&#x27;s insistence.

Sanjay stood for his first election to the Indian parliament following the lifting of the Emergency in March 1977. This election saw the crushing defeat of not only Sanjay in his constituency of Amethi but also the wiping out of Indira&#x27;s Congress party throughout Northern India. However, Sanjay won Amethi for the Congress(I) in the next general election held in January 1980.

Just one month before his death, he was appointed secretary general of the Congress Party in May 1980.

===Jama Masjid beautification and slum demolition===
Sanjay Gandhi and Brij Vardhan, accompanied by Jagmohan the vice-chairman of Delhi Development Authority (DDA), was reportedly irked during his visit to Turkman Gate in old Delhi area that he couldn&#x27;t see the grand old Jama Masjid because of the maze of tenements. On 13 April 1976, the DDA team bulldozed the tenements. Police resorted to firing to quell the demonstrations opposing the destruction. The firing resulted in at least 150 deaths. Over 70,000 people were displaced during this episode. The displaced inhabitants were moved to a new undeveloped housing site across the Yamuna river.

===Compulsory sterilisation programme===
In September 1976, Sanjay Gandhi initiated a widespread compulsory sterilisation programme to limit population growth. The exact extent of Sanjay Gandhi&#x27;s role in the implementation of the programme is somewhat disputed, with some writers holding Gandhi directly responsible for his authoritarianism, and other writers blaming the officials who implemented the programme rather than Gandhi himself.

David Frum and Vinod Mehta state that the sterilisation programmes were initiated at the behest of the IMF and the World Bank: 

===Attempted assassination===
Sanjay Gandhi escaped an assassination attempt in March 1977. Unknown gunmen fired at his car about 300 metres south-east of New Delhi during his election campaign.

==Opposition years (1977–1980)==
After losing the 1977 general election, the Congress party split again with Indira Gandhi floating her own Congress(I) faction. She won a by-election from the Chikmagalur Constituency to the Lok Sabha in November 1978. However, the Janata government&#x27;s Home Minister, Charan Singh, ordered her and Sanjay arrested on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court. The arrest meant that Indira Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament. However, this strategy backfired disastrously. Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people.

===&quot;Kissa Kursi Ka&quot; Case===
&quot;Kissa Kursi Ka&quot; is a satirical film directed by Amrit Nahata that lampooned Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi. The film was submitted to the Censor Board for certification in April 1975. The film had lampooned Sanjay Gandhi&#x27;s car manufacturing plans, besides Congress supporters like Swami Dhirendra Brahmachari, private secretary to Indira Gandhi R.K. Dhawan, and Rukhsana Sultana. The board sent the film to a seven-member revising committee, which further sent it to the Government. Subsequently, a show-cause notice raising 51 objections was sent to the producer by the Information and Broadcasting ministry. In his reply submitted on 11 July 1975, Nahata stated that the characters were &quot;imaginary and do not refer to any political party or persons&quot;. By the time, the Emergency had already been declared.

Subsequently, all the prints and the master-print of the film at Censor Board office were picked up and brought to Maruti factory in Gurgaon where they were burned. The subsequent Shah Commission, established in 1977 by the Janata party led Government of India, to enquire into excesses committed in the Indian Emergency found Sanjay guilty of burning the negative, along with V. C. Shukla, Information and Broadcasting minister during the emergency. The legal case ran for 11 months, and the court gave its judgment on 27 February 1979. Both Sanjay Gandhi and Shukla were sentenced to a two-year plus a month prison sentence. Sanjay Gandhi was denied bail. In his judgment, District Judge, O. N. Vohra at Tis Hazari in Delhi, found the accused guilty of &quot;criminal conspiracy, breach of trust, mischief by fire, dishonestly receiving criminal property, concealing stolen property and disappearance of evidence&quot;. The verdict was later overturned.

===Support for Charan Singh===
The Janata coalition under prime minister Morarji Desai was only united by its disdain for Indira Gandhi&#x27;s authoritarianism. The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the RSS. The ambitious Union Finance minister, Charan Singh, who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting different Congress factions including Congress (I). After a significant exodus from Janata party to Charan Singh faction, Morarji Desai resigned as prime minister in July 1979. Charan Singh was appointed prime minister, by President Reddy, after Indira and Sanjay promised Singh that Congress(I) would support his government from outside on certain conditions. The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay. Since Charan Singh refused to drop the charges, Congress withdrew its support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979.

Before the 1980 elections Gandhi approached the then Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, Syed Abdullah Bukhari and entered into an agreement with him on the basis of 10-point programme to secure the support of the Muslim votes. In the elections held in January, Congress returned to power with a landslide majority.

==1980 Indian elections==
The Congress(I) under Gandhi swept to power in January 1980. Elections soon after to legislative assemblies in States ruled by opposition parties brought back Congress ministries to those states. Sanjay Gandhi at that time selected his own loyalists to head the governments in these states.

==Personal life==
Gandhi married Maneka Anand, who was 10 years his junior, in New Delhi on 24 September 1974. Their son, Varun, was born shortly before Gandhi&#x27;s death. According to Maneka, Sanjay wanted to raise his children in the Zoroastrian faith of his paternal family.

==Death==
At 8:10 a.m. on 23 June 1980, Gandhi lost control of his aeroplane while performing an aerobatic manoeuvre and crashed. Captain Subhash Saxena, the only other passenger, also died. Gandhi&#x27;s body was recovered and cremated as per Hindu rituals.

<text>Peel Slowly and See is a five-disc box set of material by the Velvet Underground. It was released in September 1995 by Polydor.

==Compilation==
The name of this box set comes from the instruction presented on vinyl copies of the band&#x27;s debut album to peel back the banana sticker featured on the cover. The set includes all four studio albums by the Lou Reed-era line-ups of the Velvet Underground, alongside demo recordings and live performances, some of which had been previously bootlegged, and some of which had never before been released. &quot;Squeeze&quot;, recorded after Reed&#x27;s departure from the band, is not included. &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot;, the band&#x27;s self-titled third album, uses the &quot;closet mix&quot;, Lou Reed&#x27;s mix of the album that gives more emphasis to the vocals, and was the mix used on the original release. The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Loaded&quot;, is presented with &quot;full-length versions&quot; of three of its tracks, &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and &quot;New Age&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist David Fricke wrote extensive liner notes in an accompanying booklet, which also pictured many items of Velvet Underground memorabilia from the collection of guitarist Sterling Morrison.

<text>ABC Kids (originally titled Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning until 2002) was an American Saturday morning children&#x27;s programming block that aired on ABC from September 13, 1997 to August 27, 2011. It featured a mixture of animated and live-action series from Walt Disney Television Animation and Disney Channel, aimed at children between the ages of 6 and 14. This was the only time that Disney Channel content aired on over-the-air television in the United States, but first being Nickelodeon on CBS (owned by Viacom [now Paramount]) two years earlier.

The block regularly aired on Saturday mornings, though certain programs within the lineup aired on Sundays in some parts nationwide due to station preferences for non-educational programming or scheduling issues with regional or network sports broadcasts.

After five years of mainly reruns of programs introduced onto the block prior to the 2007–08 season, ABC decided it would cease to provide children&#x27;s programming during the Saturday morning timeslot, and entered into an agreement with Litton Entertainment to program that period; the block that resulted from this deal – Litton&#x27;s Weekend Adventure, which is structured as a syndication package distributed with virtual exclusivity to ABC&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations and affiliates – replaced ABC Kids on September 3, 2011.

==History==

===Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning===

After The Walt Disney Company purchased ABC corporate parent Capital Cities/ABC Inc. in 1995, the network&#x27;s children&#x27;s program block ABC Saturday Morning, aired such Disney-produced series as &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot;, &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; and &quot;Gargoyles&quot;; it was one of two networks at the time that prominently carried Disney programming on Saturday mornings, as CBS also carried Disney cartoons (CBS&#x27; were mostly television spin-offs of Disney Renaissance films, whereas ABC&#x27;s were mostly other Disney properties). After Disney formally took over ABC&#x27;s operations, Disney head Michael Eisner sought to create a Saturday morning block that was different from those carried by its competitors at the time.

In February 1997, Peter Hastings left Warner Bros. Animation and joined Disney, where he was tasked with overhauling ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup in order to compete against Fox Kids and Kids&#x27; WB. He pitched an idea around the concept that Saturday is different from every other day of the week, and the representation of weekdays as buildings. Hastings also proposed the use of virtual set technology; although he knew a bit about it at the time and the technology used was just starting to be developed, Disney and ABC liked the idea. He hired Prudence Fenton as consultant manager and co-executive producer. Together, they sampled virtual set technology at the 1997 NAB Show and chose technology developed by Accom and ELSET. Rutherford Bench Productions, which had previously worked with Disney on other projects, hired Pacific Ocean Post (now POP Sound) to produce the virtual set. The building was initially a drawing of Grand Central Terminal with a roller coaster added but evolved into a towering mechanical structure. Even the interior has similarities such as a central high raised room, with two wings on the left and right sides and another on the south side.

On September 13, 1997, Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning premiered as a two-hour sub-block within the ABC Saturday Morning lineup. It was originally scheduled to premiere the Saturday prior on September 6, but coverage by all U.S. networks of the funeral of Princess Diana pushed back the premiere by one week to September 13. Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning featured two parts: three hours of regularly scheduled cartoons and a two-hour flagship show that included feature segments, comedy skits, and the virtual world which Hastings had proposed, along with newer episodes of three animated series: &quot;Doug&quot; (which had been acquired from Nickelodeon in 1996), &quot;Recess&quot; and &quot;Pepper Ann&quot;.

&quot;Doug&quot;, &quot;Recess&quot; and &quot;Pepper Ann&quot; were each nominally given 40-minute timeslots. The extended 10 minutes during each show&#x27;s slot were for One Saturday Morning&#x27;s interstitial segments and educational features. The live-action wraparound segments were originally hosted by Charlie (portrayed by Jessica Prunell) for the block&#x27;s first season in 1997, and later by MeMe (Valarie Rae Miller) starting in September 1998 until 2000; the segments also featured an elephant named Jelly Roll (voiced by stand-up comedian and actor Brad Garrett), who served as a sidekick to the human host, while the eccentric Manny the Uncanny (Paul Rugg), host of his own standalone segment where he visited and observed different jobs, made occasional appearances outside that segment.

&quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot;, a longtime essential of ABC&#x27;s Saturday morning block since 1973, also aired as an interstitial segment during &quot;The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show&quot; (along shorts airing on Nickelodeon until 1999), likewise a carryover from the pre-Disney era (it would continue until ABC&#x27;s contract with then-AOL Time Warner expired in 2000).

Disney’s One Saturday Morning was initially a massive success, beating Fox Kids during its first season to be the most-watched Saturday morning block on broadcast television. It remained competitive in its second season, beating all of Fox Kids&#x27; shows except &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. The third season remained competitive with its broadcast peers on Fox and Kids WB, with &quot;The Weekenders&quot; being a bright spot for the block; the new series dethroned anime show &quot;Pokémon&quot; to become broadcast television&#x27;s most-watched Saturday morning cartoon, though all of the broadcast networks had fallen behind Nickelodeon.

The block received a new brand identity in the fall of 2000; this was followed by the shorts and hosted segments being discontinued on December 16 in a reformatting of the ABC block. By this time, the interstitials within the block were relegated to bumpers and program promotions. The change proved to be disastrous; by February 2001, ratings had fallen to less than half of its competitors&#x27; on Fox, The WB and Nickelodeon. In Fall 2001, live-action series were added to the One Saturday Morning lineup with the addition of the &quot;Zoog Hour,&quot; an hour-long sub-block featuring the Disney Channel original series &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and &quot;Even Stevens&quot; (the sub-block, advertised in promos for Disney’s One Saturday Morning promoting the two programs as &quot;powered by Zoog,&quot; was named after Disney Channel&#x27;s weekend programming block at the time, Zoog Disney).

A spin-off of Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning, Disney&#x27;s One Too, premiered on UPN on September 6, 1999; produced through a time-lease agreement between Disney and UPN, the block aired each weekday (either in the morning or afternoon, depending on the station&#x27;s preference) and on Sunday mornings, and featured many of the programs shown on One Saturday Morning (including &quot;Recess&quot;, &quot;Pepper Ann&quot; and &quot;&quot;).

===ABC Kids===
On July 23, 2001, the Walt Disney Company purchased Fox Family Worldwide, primarily for its Fox Family Channel, which was included in the sale as well as Saban Entertainment, a company in which Fox purchased a 50% interest in 1994. On September 14, 2002, ABC rebranded its Saturday morning block, as a subtle nod to the Fox Kids brand acquired by Disney through its purchase of Fox Family Worldwide, to ABC Kids (as a result of the sale, Fox Kids ceased to exist; Fox&#x27;s children&#x27;s program lineups would be handled from that point onward by 4Kids Entertainment until 2008).

The renamed block originally contained a mix of first-run programs exclusive to the block, as well as reruns of several original series from both Disney Channel and Toon Disney. &quot;NBA Inside Stuff&quot; also began airing on the block as a result of ABC&#x27;s acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the NBA from NBC (where the series originally premiered in 1990), starting with the 2002–03 season&#x27;s Christmas Day game; &quot;Inside Stuff&quot; continued to air on ABC Kids until 2004. The series premiere of Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot; was also held on ABC Kids on September 20, 2003, with a delayed premiere on Disney Channel on October 12, 2003. The new block ditched the imagery of the &quot;One Saturday Morning&quot; era in favor of a sports stadium motif, which, in 2006, was changed to a rock concert design that remained throughout the last five years of ABC Kids.

Through Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Saban Entertainment, the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series moved from Fox Kids to the ABC Kids block. All first-run episodes from the franchise premiered on ABC Kids starting with the second half of the show&#x27;s &quot;Wild Force&quot; season (starting with the episode &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;), with the entirety of the &quot;Wild Force&quot; and &quot;Ninja Storm&quot; seasons subsequently airing in reruns on ABC Family (the former season aired in part both before the introduction of and during the ABC Family Action Block). However, when Toon Disney and ABC Family jointly launched the action-oriented Jetix block in 2004, Jetix handled all first-run episode debuts of subsequent seasons from &quot;Dino Thunder&quot; to &quot;Jungle Fury&quot;, while ABC Kids aired these seasons in reruns. Due to the low ratings of the &quot;Jungle Fury&quot; season, as well as the merger between Jetix and Toon Disney to form Disney XD in 2009, the &quot;RPM&quot; season aired exclusively on ABC Kids. After production on &quot;RPM&quot; had concluded, instead of producing a new season, Disney produced a re-version of the first 32 episodes of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, which included a new logo, an updated title sequence, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative visual effects. The re-version aired from January 2 to August 28, 2010 (the 17th anniversary of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;), after which Haim Saban bought the franchise back and Nickelodeon acquired broadcast rights to the series.

In the 2004–05 season, ABC Kids dropped its two remaining original series, &quot;Fillmore!&quot; and &quot;Recess&quot; (the latter of which was airing in reruns on the block since it ended in 2001). With the transfer of Walt Disney Television Animation to Disney Channels Worldwide, ABC fulfilled the FCC&#x27;s three-hour quota by carrying select episodes of Disney Channel live-action comedies and animated series (anywhere between 9 and 13 episodes from a given season) featuring moral lessons and/or educational anecdotes. The episodes were selected by both the &quot;Standards and Practices&quot; division of the network and any educational consultants who were attached to the shows. &quot;The Replacements&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; were the last two Disney Channel series to be added to the block in Fall 2006. Beginning with the 2007–08 season, ABC Kids programming (with the exception of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;) became fully automated, putting the same handful of episodes of each show (&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New School&quot;, &quot;The Replacements&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;, &quot;Hannah Montana&quot; and &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;) on a permanent rotation for the block&#x27;s remaining four years.

===Closure===
In March 2010, ABC made the decision to cease providing a three-hour block of E/I-compliant, repurposed Disney Channel programming sent to its own stations and ABC affiliates. The network chose to lease out the three-hour timeslot and seek other programmers for an agreement to produce a syndicated block, not for the network, but for each ABC station as the network was turning the E/I responsibility back to local ABC stations.

A month later, ABC&#x27;s affiliate board announced that it had reached a deal with Litton Entertainment, a production company which produced syndicated programming (including educational programs aimed at youth), to produce six, all-new, original half-hour E/I series exclusively for ABC stations for the 2011–12 season.

The block aired for the last time on August 27, 2011 without any announcement of its closure, and was quietly replaced by Litton&#x27;s Weekend Adventure the following week on September 3.

<text>Rogan josh (English: ); ), also spelled roghan josh or roghan ghosht, is an aromatic curried meat dish originating from Kashmir.

It is made with red meat—traditionally lamb, mutton, or goat—and coloured and flavoured primarily by alkanet flower (or root) and Kashmiri chilies. It is one of the signature recipes of Kashmiri cuisine.

==Etymology==

A number of origins of the name have been suggested. &quot;Rawghan&quot; means &quot;clarified butter&quot; or &quot;oil&quot; in Persian, while &quot;jōš&quot; means to &quot;stew&quot; or &quot;braise&quot; and ultimately derives from the verb &quot;jōšīdan&quot; meaning &quot;to boil&quot;. Rogan josh, by this definition, may mean &quot;stewed in ghee&quot;. An alternative etymology is that the name derives from either the word &quot;roghan&quot; (, ), &quot;brown&quot; or &quot;red&quot;, or the Koshur &quot;roghan&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, along with the word either for &quot;meat&quot;, (&quot;gošt&quot;) often romanized as &quot;rogan ghosht&quot; or &quot;gosht&quot;, or a word meaning &quot;juice&quot;, giving possible meanings of &quot;red meat&quot; or &quot;red juice&quot;. The exact etymology remains uncertain as both &quot;rogan josh&quot; and &quot;rogan ghosht&quot; are used to refer to the dish and it is unclear which of the names is the original.

==Origin==
Rogan josh is a staple of Kashmiri cuisine and is one of the main dishes of the Kashmiri multi-course meal, the &quot;wazwan&quot;. The dish was originally brought to Kashmir by the Mughals, whose cuisine was, in turn, influenced by Persian cuisine. The unrelenting summer heat of the central Indian plains took the Mughals frequently to the country&#x27;s northern region, Kashmir, which has a cooler climate because of its elevation and latitude.

==Preparation==
Rogan josh consists of pieces of lamb or mutton braised with a gravy flavoured with garlic, ginger and aromatic spices (clove, bay leaves, cardamom, and cinnamon), and in some versions incorporating onions or yoghurt. After initial braising, the dish may be finished using the dampokhtak slow-cooking technique. Its characteristic deep red colour traditionally comes from dried flowers or root of &quot;Alkanna tinctoria&quot; (&quot;ratan jot&quot;) and from liberal amounts of dried, deseeded Kashmiri red chilli (&quot;lal mirch&quot;).

There are different approaches in preparation: Some use &quot;praan&quot;, a local form of shallot, and petals of &quot;maval&quot;, the cockscomb flower, for colouring (and for its supposed &quot;cooling&quot; effect); others may add yoghurt and asafoetida to give additional body and flavor.

==Adaptations==
While the traditional preparation uses whole dried chilies that are de-seeded, soaked in water, and ground to a paste, non-traditional shortcuts use either Kashmiri chili powder (available in Indian stores) or a mixture of paprika (predominantly) and cayenne pepper, adjusted to taste. (Madhur Jaffrey&#x27;s recipe calls for a 4:1 ratio of paprika to cayenne.) An updated version served in Sanjeev Kapoor&#x27;s restaurants uses white and black cardamom, anise, and bay leaves.

Many western interpretations of the dish add tomatoes to the sauce. This is especially common with ready-made pour-over cooking sauces to the point where the dish may be considered tomato-based. The authenticity of including tomatoes is disputed: some authors state that tomatoes are not part of the traditional dish or of traditional Indian cuisine and should not be included. However, other authors have specifically referred to rogan josh as a dish based around meat and tomatoes, while others have identified tomatoes with a Punjabi version of the dish as opposed to a Kashmiri one.

==With other meats==
There is a variety with beef as well, brisket being preferred.

<text>Marie-France Gaite (; born 17 July 1941 in Lyon, France – died 18 January 1968), better known as Gribouille () was a singer, musician, and songwriter.

As a teenager, she suffered from a mental disorder, and for a time was confined against her will to a psychiatric hospital in Lyon. With medication, she was able to function well enough to leave her hometown and she made her way to Paris. Gribouille, as she was called since her school days, is French for naive and foolishly happy people. Likely to throw themselves into a river to keep from getting wet in the rain.

In Paris she met Jean Cocteau while she was drawing art on the sidewalk with chalk. He drew a portrait of her and added &quot;To my friend Gribouille.&quot; She carefully added an &#x27;e&#x27; to &quot;ami&quot; (feminine gender for &quot;friend&quot; is &quot;amie&quot;), embarrassed that Cocteau thought she was a boy. She had a very androgynous appearance, and a deep voice, and Cocteau got her work singing in a cabaret. Since she was at the bottom, even these sleazy cabaret acts were a step up for her. In 1963, through sheer talent and her intense persona, she joined the roster of Pathé Records. She was hailed (as many were) as the new Édith Piaf, and also compared with Barbara. Charles Dumont, who wrote many of Piaf&#x27;s hits, also began writing songs for her. Composer Michel Breuzard also wrote music for her, and in 1966 she recorded several EP&#x27;s and her first album. She appeared many times on television to sing her songs.

She died in Paris, France, at the age of 26 from an excess of alcohol and drugs. She joined many famous and historical figures buried in the Jewish Cimetière de Bagneux in Montrouge, southwest of Paris.

<text>Hal Kanter (December 18, 1918 – November 6, 2011) was an American writer, producer and director, principally for comedy actors such as Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis, and Elvis Presley (in &quot;Loving You&quot; and &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;), for both feature films and television. Kanter helped Tennessee Williams turn the play by Williams into the film version of &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;. He was regularly credited as a writer for the Academy Award broadcasts. Kanter was also the creator and executive producer of the television series &quot;Julia&quot;.

== Biography ==
Kanter was born to a Jewish family in Savannah, Georgia. He started his career peddling jokes to Eddie Cantor for his radio program. Kanter recalls, &quot;I&#x27;d listen to his show and say, &#x27;I can write jokes as funny as that,&#x27; so I walked from my rooming house to his show, and told the guard, &#x27;Mr. Kanter is here to see Mr. Cantor, figuring he&#x27;d see me because of our names, although his real name was Iskowitch. I was seventeen years old and had the nerve of a burglar.&quot; Although Kanter was not hired by Cantor, one of his writers, Hugh Wedlock Jr., paid Kanter $10 per week to write jokes. Wedlock would then resell Kanter&#x27;s jokes to Cantor. Kanter stated, &quot;So I became a ghostwriter to a ghostwriter.&quot;

March 1941 joined the United States Army serving till the end of World War II in 1945. Kanter wrote, produced, and acted in Armed Forces Radio Service shows aired over stations KOA (AM), KLZ, and other local stations in Colorado. He built and ran radio stations in Naval Base Eniwetok and Naval Base Guam; and served as a combat correspondent on Iwo Jima.

Kanter&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;So Far, So Funny: My Life in Show Business&quot;, was published in 1999 by McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., of Jefferson, North Carolina. The book chronicles his early life, his struggles in Hollywood during his early years, and his eventual success in show business in general and as a comedy writer in particular.

Kanter died at his home in Encino, California on November 6, 2011, at the age of 92.

<doc id="562650" wikidata="Q381800" url="?curid=562650" title="Paul Adam (French novelist)">
<text>Paul Auguste Marie Adam (7 December 1862 – 1 January 1920) was a French novelist who became an early proponent of Symbolism in France, and one of the founders of the Symbolist review &quot;Le Symboliste&quot;. He was a prominent writer in Montmartre&#x27;s anarchist movement.

==Career==
Adam&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Chair molle&quot; (&quot;Soft Flesh&quot;), was the story of a prostitute in the Naturalist manner, which led to him being prosecuted for immorality before the Cour d&#x27;assises and sentenced to a fortnight in prison and a 500-franc fine. Together with Jean Moréas, he co-wrote &quot;Les Demoiselles Goubert&quot;, a novel that marked the transition to Symbolism in French literature. His &quot;Lettres de Malaisie&quot; (1897) was speculative fiction about politics in the future. He also wrote a series of historical novels that dealt with the period of the Napoleonic Wars and their aftermath; the first installment in the series, &quot;La Force&quot;, was published in 1899. It was followed by &quot;L&#x27;enfant d&#x27;Austerlitz&quot; (1901), &quot;La ruse&quot; (1902) and &quot;Au soleil de Juillet&quot; (1903). His work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

He was born and died in Paris.

<text>C. Sheldon Roberts (October 27, 1926 – June 6, 2014) was an American semiconductor pioneer, and member of the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; who founded Silicon Valley.

==Biography==
Roberts earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in metallurgical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1948, and a Master&#x27;s degree in 1949 and Ph.D. in 1952, from MIT.

Roberts then worked in research at the Naval Research Lab and the Dow Chemical Company. He joined the seminal Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments in Mountain View, California, but left the company along with other members of the traitorous eight with the backing of Sherman Fairchild to form the influential Fairchild Semiconductor corporation.

Roberts later founded Amelco (known now as Teledyne) with traitorous eight alumni Jean Hoerni and Jay Last.

<text>A war economy or wartime economy is the set of preparations undertaken by a modern state to mobilize its economy for war production. Philippe Le Billon describes a war economy as a &quot;system of producing, mobilizing and allocating resources to sustain the violence.&quot; Some measures taken include the increasing of interest rates as well as the introduction of resource allocation programs. Approaches to the reconfiguration of the economy differ from country to country.

Many states increase the degree of planning in their economies during wars. That in many cases extends to rationing and in some cases to conscription for civil defense, such as the Women&#x27;s Land Army and Bevin Boys in the United Kingdom during World War II. During total war situations, certain buildings and positions are often seen as important targets by combatants. The Union blockade, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea during the American Civil War, and the strategic bombing of enemy cities and factories during World War II are all examples of total war.

Concerning the side of aggregate demand, the concept of a war economy has been linked to the concept of &quot;military Keynesianism&quot;, in which the government&#x27;s military budget stabilizes business cycles and fluctuations and/or is used to fight recessions. On the supply side, it has been observed that wars sometimes have the effect of accelerating technological progress to such an extent that an economy is greatly strengthened after the war, especially if it has avoided the war-related destruction. That was the case, for example, with the United States during World War I and World War II. Some economists such as Seymour Melman argue, however, that the wasteful nature of much of military spending eventually can hurt technological progress.

War is often used as a last-ditch effort to prevent deteriorating economic conditions or currency crises, particularly by expanding services and employment in the military and by simultaneously depopulating segments of the population to free up resources and restore the economic and social order. A temporary war economy can also be seen as a means to avoid the need for more permanent militarization. During World War II, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt stated that if the Axis powers won, &quot;we would have to convert ourselves permanently into a militaristic power on the basis of war economy.&quot;

== United States ==
The United States has a very complex history with wartime economies. Many notable instances came during the 20th century during which the country&#x27;s main conflicts were World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.

=== World War I ===

In mobilizing for World War I, the United States expanded its governmental powers by creating institutions such as the War Industries Board (WIB) to help with military production. Others, such as the Fuel Administration, introduced daylight saving time in an effort to save coal and oil while the Food Administration encouraged higher grain production and &quot;mobilized a spirit of self-sacrifice rather than mandatory rationing.&quot;

Propaganda also played a large part in garnering support for topics ranging from tax initiatives to food conservation. Speaking on Four Minute Men, volunteers who rallied the public through short speeches, investigative journalist George Creel stated that the idea was extremely popular and the program saw thousands of volunteers throughout the states.

===World War II===

In the case of World War II, the U.S. government took similar measures in increasing its control over the economy. The Fall of France and the Dunkirk evacuation across the English Channel before the Battle of Britain provided the sparks that were needed to begin the country&#x27;s conversion to a wartime economy and the July 1940 passing of the Two-Ocean Navy Act. The 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor prolonged and expanded those measures.

Washington felt that a greater bureaucracy was needed to help with mobilization. The government raised taxes which paid for half of the costs of the war and borrowed money in the form of war bonds to cover the rest of the bill. &quot;Commercial institutions like banks also bought billions of dollars of bonds and other treasury paper, holding more than $24 billion at the war&#x27;s end.&quot; The creation of a handful of agencies helped funnel resources towards the war effort. One prominent agency was the War Production Board (WPB), which &quot;awarded defense contracts, allocated scarce resources – such as rubber, copper, and oil – for military uses, and persuaded businesses to convert to military production.&quot;

The United States mass-produced many vehicles, such as ships (i.e. Liberty ships), aircraft (i.e. North American P-51 Mustang), jeeps (i.e. Willys MB), and tanks (i.e. M4 Sherman).

Two thirds of the American economy had been integrated into the war effort by the end of 1943. Because of the massive cooperation between government and private entities, it could be argued that the economic measures enacted prior to and during the Second World War helped lead the Allies to victory.

===Today===
The United States has been involved in numerous military endeavours within the Middle East and Latin America since the 1960s and has been in a continuous state of war since the September 11 attacks. The country has an annual military budget that is larger than those of India, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and France combined.

== Germany ==
=== World War I ===
Germany experienced economic devastation during both World Wars. That was not a result of faulty economic planning, but it is important to understand the ways that Germany approached reconstruction. During World War I, the German agricultural sector was hit hard by the demands of the war effort. Many of the workers conscripted, and much of the food itself was allocated for the troops, which led to a shortage. &quot;German authorities were not able to solve the food scarcity [problem], but implemented a food rationing system and several price ceilings to prevent speculation and profiteering. Unfortunately, these measures did not have the desired success.&quot;

=== World War II ===

Heading into World War II, the Nazis introduced new policies that not only caused the unemployment rate to drop but also created a competent war machine in clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The Third Reich implemented a draft and built factories to supply its quickly expanding military. Both actions created jobs for many Germans who had been struggling from the economic collapse after World War I. However, while unemployment rates plummeted, &quot;by 1939, government debt stood at over 40 billion Reichsmarks (equivalent to billion euros).&quot; During the war, Germany heavily exploited the economies of the countries that it conquered.

The most important one, according to the historians Boldorf and Scherner, was France and &quot;her highly developed economy... [being] one of the biggest in Europe.&quot; That is further supported when the authors later reveal how the French economy provided for 11 percent of Germany&#x27;s national income during the occupation, which covered five months of Germany&#x27;s total income during the war. Using extortion and forced labor, the Nazis siphoned off much of France&#x27;s economic output. For example, during the early months of the German occupation, Vichy France was forced to pay a &quot;quartering&quot; fee of twenty million Reichsmarks per day. Supposedly, the fee was payment for the Nazi occupation forces. In reality, the money was used to fuel the war economy. Germany employed numerous methods to support its war effort. However, the German surrender to the Allies makes it difficult to tell what the Nazis&#x27; economic policies would have yielded in the long term.

== Other examples ==
Armenia is another example that followed war economy principles, especially during the 2020 Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. The small country, which is in the Caucasus, was blockaded but still increased its military budget after 2018, when it reached $640 million. In 2019, its military cost 18.8% of the country&#x27;s total budget. Besides mobilizing financial resources, Armenia also declared mobilization and concentrated human capital (volunteers, doctors, and soldiers).

<text>Igor Mitoraj (: ; 26 March 1944 – 6 October 2014), born Jerzy Manika, was a Polish artist and monumental sculptor. Known for his fragmented sculptures of the human body often created as large-scale installations in public places. His work is internationally exhibited, mainly in Europe.

==Biography==
Mitoraj was born on 26 March 1944 in Oederan, Germany. His Polish mother, Zofia Manika, was a forced labourer, while his father was a French Foreign Legion officer of Polish extraction held as a POW. His parents&#x27; relationship was only fleeting and he returned with his mother to Poland after the end of World War II. He spent his childhood years in his grandparents&#x27; village of Grojec. When his mother married, both she and her son adopted the family name of the husband, Czesław Mitoraj. The surname in Polish happens to be a concatenation of the words for &#x27;myth&#x27; and &#x27;paradise&#x27;. He would later change his birth forename, &#x27;Jerzy&#x27; (George) to &quot;Igor&quot; when he moved to France. He graduated from secondary art school in Bielsko-Biała and in 1963 entered the Kraków Academy of Art to study painting under Tadeusz Kantor. While a student he had several joint exhibitions, and held his first solo show in 1967 at the Krzysztofory Gallery in Poland. It seems doubtful that he graduated after only two years since in 1968, despite travel restrictions placed on ordinary people by the then Communist regime, he was somehow able to move to Paris, partly to seek out his biological father whom he failed to meet, and to continue his art studies at the École Supérieur des Beaux-Arts.

In the early 1970s he became fascinated by Aztec art and culture, spending a year painting and travelling around Mexico. The experience led him to take up sculpture. He returned to Paris in 1974 and two years later he had another solo exhibition at the &quot;La Hune&quot; gallery, when he exhibited his first sculptural work. The success of the show persuaded him to develop as a sculptor.

Having previously worked with terracotta and bronze, a trip to Carrara, Italy in 1979, inspired him to use marble as his primary medium and in 1983 he set up a studio in Pietrasanta near Carrara in Italy. In 2006, he was commissioned to create new bronze doors and a statue of John the Baptist for the basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Rome.

In 2003, he returned to Poland. In 2005, he received the Golden Medal of Medal for Merit to Culture - Gloria Artis In 2012, he was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.
Mitoraj died in a Paris hospital and was buried in Pietrasanta where he had kept a studio for many years.

In 2016, Mitoraj&#x27;s works were exhibited in Pompei, Italy. The Italian culture minister Stefano Contini announced that the artist&#x27;s sculpture entitled &quot;Daedalus&quot; would remain in Pompeii permanently as a gift to Italy.

==Style==
Mitoraj&#x27;s sculptural style is based on the classical tradition with its focus on the well modelled torso. However, Mitoraj introduced a post-modern twist with ostentatiously truncated limbs, emphasising the damage sustained by many authentic classical sculptures. Often his works aim to address the attributes of the human body, its beauty and fragility, its suffering as well as deeper aspects of human nature, which with the passing of time undergo degeneration. Some art critics have likened his work to Kitsch.

<text>The Cimetière des Gonards () is the largest cemetery in Versailles on the outskirts of Paris. It began operations in 1879. The cemetery covers an area of and contains more than 12,000 graves.

==Description==
This is a rurally landscaped cemetery, the upper part of which is laid out with walks and planted with trees. The Devos-Logie and Mirand-Devos Chapels were designed by the architect Hector Guimard in 1894.

There is a section for military graves, including 534 German military graves from the two World Wars, marked by a monument and stelae of pink granite, and a war graves section containing the graves of 181 British Commonwealth service personnel of both World Wars. In the highest part is a monument to those French service personnel who are buried in the graveyards of North Africa.

The cemetery also contains a Jewish area (sections &quot;L sud&quot; and &quot;L ouest&quot;), and many English and American Protestant burials.

The notorious executed murderers Henri Désiré Landru and Eugène Weidmann are buried here, in unmarked graves.

<doc id="562679" wikidata="Q733506" url="?curid=562679" title="Leander-class cruiser (1931)">
<text>The &quot;Leander&quot; class was a class of eight light cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s that saw service in World War II. They were named after mythological figures, and all ships were commissioned between 1933 and 1936. The three ships of the second group were sold to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) before World War II and renamed after Australian cities.

==Design==
The &quot;Leander&quot; class was influenced by the &quot;York&quot;-class heavy cruiser and was an attempt to better provide for the role of commerce protection. The 7,000-7,200 ton &quot;Leander&quot;s were armed with eight BL 6 inch Mk XXIII naval guns in twin turrets, two forward and two aft. Their secondary armament consisted of four high-angle QF 4 inch Mk V naval guns, which were later replaced by twin mountings for eight guns (the later high angle QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun). Their close-range anti-aircraft weaponry consisted of twelve Vickers machine guns in three quadruple mounts. They also shipped a bank of four torpedo tubes on each beam and provision was made in the design for the carriage of two catapult-launched Fairey Seafox aircraft.

Speed was , and 845 tons of armour was provided. During trials in December 1932 &quot;Leander&quot; made with at 7265 tons displacement and with at 9010 tons deep displacement. The first five vessels did not contain dispersed machinery; the boiler rooms were arranged together and exhausted into a single funnel, a unique feature amongst British cruisers. This meant that damage amidships was more liable to disable all the boiler rooms. In service their machinery proved to be highly reliable and exceeded trials output by a wide margin as evidenced by &quot;Achilles&quot; on 13 December 1939 during The Battle of the River Plate:
===Wartime modifications===
During the war, significant modifications were made to the vessels. Various additional anti-aircraft armament was added, and the two New Zealand vessels removed a turret to carry heavier 20 mm and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns in its place. Changes to the aircraft launching capability were reported, although use is unclear.

==Ships in class==


===&quot;Leander&quot; group===
* &quot;Leander&quot;
Loaned to New Zealand, commissioned as HMNZS &quot;Leander&quot; in September 1941. At the Battle of Kolombangara, &quot;Leander&quot; was heavily damaged by a Long Lance torpedo, causing many casualties, and sending the ship to repairs for two years.

* &quot;Achilles&quot;, later HMIS/INS &quot;Delhi&quot;.
&quot;Achilles&quot; was the second vessel loaned to New Zealand, commissioned as HMNZS &quot;Achilles&quot; in September 1941. She had earlier participated in the Battle of the River Plate. &quot;Achilles&quot; was sold to India in 1948, and was known as HMIS &quot;Delhi&quot; for a few years, then served as INS &quot;Delhi&quot;, until 1978.
&quot;Ajax&quot; participated in the Battle of the River Plate. The town of Ajax, Ontario was named after the ship, with street names in the town named after members of the crew. &quot;Ajax&quot; also participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan and took part in shelling the mainland of Normandy during the beach landings. Chile wanted to buy HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; in 1948-9, but the opposition leader in the UK, Winston Churchill thought the ship should be retained for the RN and it became a political issue. The Leander class cruisers were very well built in the early 1930s and in the case of &quot;Achilles&quot; proved capable of more than 40 years service. After the rest of the class, including HMS &quot;Ajax,&quot; were scrapped, there was regret in the RN, because in many ways with their long 12,000-mile range and generous hull they were ideal for use as ocean radar pickets.
Manned by New Zealand crew, although not part of the Royal New Zealand Navy. &quot;Neptune&quot; was sunk by an Italian mine off the coast of Tripoli.
&quot;Orion&quot; spent much of the early war in the Mediterranean providing escort to convoys and was also at the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. She participated in the evacuation of Crete in 1941 and was heavily damaged. Orion&#x27;s repairs were completed in March 1942, after which she was widely employed, in home waters and on convoy escort duties to Africa and the Indian Ocean. Orion returned to the Mediterranean in October 1942 and was involved in convoy escort duties and supported the army in the invasion of Sicily. She also took part in the Normandy Landings in June 1944, where she fired the first shell. Orion received 13 battle honours, a record only exceeded by and matched by two others.

===Modified &quot;Leander&quot; group===
The last three ships of the class, referred to as the &quot;Modified &quot;Leander&quot;, &quot;Amphion&quot;, or &quot;Perth&quot;&quot; class, had their machinery and propulsion equipment organised in two self-contained units (separated fore and aft), allowing the ship to continue operating if one set was damaged. The two exhaust funnels, one for each machinery space, gave the modified ships a different profile from the early &quot;Leander&quot;s, which had a single funnel. To cover the separate machinery spaces, the side armour was extended from , negating the weight reduction created by the separation. During design, it was planned to modify the forward-most and aft-most 6-inch turrets to be fitted with three guns instead of two, but the plan was cancelled when it was determined that the required alterations would cause several negative side effects, including reducing the ship&#x27;s top speed and causing problems with effective fire control. All three ships were sold to the RAN, &quot;Sydney&quot; while under construction and &quot;Perth&quot; and &quot;Hobart&quot; after a few years of British service.

*&quot;Perth&quot; (ex-&quot;Amphion&quot;)
Completed 1936 as HMS &quot;Amphion&quot; and transferred to the RAN as HMAS &quot;Perth&quot; in 1939. She operated with British ships in the Battle of the Mediterranean, participating in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. Lost in the Battle of Sunda Strait in early 1942.

*&quot;Hobart&quot; (ex-&quot;Apollo&quot;)
Completed 1936 as HMS &quot;Apollo&quot; and transferred to the RAN in 1938 as HMAS &quot;Hobart&quot;, she took part in the East African Campaign, the Battle of the Coral Sea and provided fire support at Guadalcanal. After being badly damaged by a torpedo strike in 1943, she returned to action in the Philippines landings (1944), followed by the Borneo and Aitape-Wewak campaigns. She was put into reserve after the war and was not decommissioned until 1962.

*&quot;Sydney&quot; (ex-&quot;Phaeton&quot;)
Laid down as HMS &quot;Phaeton&quot;, the ship was acquired by the RAN, launched as HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; and was commissioned in 1935. Also involved in the Mediterranean campaign. &quot;Sydney&quot; sank the Italian cruiser &quot;Bartolomeo Colleoni&quot; at the Battle of Cape Spada in 1940. Later that year, &quot;Sydney&quot; took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan and Battle of Calabria, sinking two Italian destroyers, the and . In 1941, off Western Australia, &quot;Sydney&quot; encountered the German auxiliary cruiser &quot;Kormoran&quot;; the two ships destroyed each other and &quot;Sydney&quot; was lost with all hands; the wrecks of both ships were located in 2008.

==In fiction==
Warren Tute&#x27;s novel &quot;The Cruiser&quot; features HMS &quot;Antigone&quot;, a &quot;Leander&quot;-class cruiser with a striking similarity to &quot;Ajax&quot;.

Douglas Reeman&#x27;s novel &quot;A Ship Must Die&quot; is set aboard the titular fictional &quot;Leander&quot;-class cruiser &quot;Andromeda&quot; pitted against a German surface raider operating in the Indian Ocean.

<text>The Czechoslovak Legion (Czech: &quot;Československé legie&quot;; Slovak: &quot;Československé légie&quot;) were volunteer armed forces consisting predominantly of Czechs and Slovaks fighting on the side of the Entente powers during World War I and the White Army during the Russian Civil War until November 1919. Their goal was to win the support of the Allied Powers for the independence of Lands of the Bohemian Crown from the Austrian Empire and of Slovak territories from the Kingdom of Hungary, which were then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With the help of émigré intellectuals and politicians such as the Czech Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and the Slovak Milan Rastislav Štefánik, they grew into a force over 100,000 strong.

In Russia, they took part in several victorious battles of the war, including the Zborov and Bakhmach against the Central Powers, and were heavily involved in the Russian Civil War fighting Bolsheviks, at times controlling the entire Trans-Siberian railway and several major cities in Siberia.

After three years of existence as a small unit in the Imperial Russian Army, the Legion in Russia was established in 1917, with other troops fighting in France since the beginning of the war as the &quot;Nazdar&quot; company, and similar units later emerging in Italy and Serbia. Originally an all-volunteer force, these formations were later strengthened by Czech and Slovak prisoners of war or deserters from the Austro-Hungarian Army. The majority of the legionaries were Czechs, with Slovaks making up 7% of the force in Russia, 3% in Italy and 16% in France.

The name &quot;Czechoslovak Legion&quot; preceded and anticipated the creation of 
&quot;Czechoslovakia&quot;.

==Involvement in World War I==

===In Russia===

In the first months of World War I, the response of the Czech soldiers and civilians to the war and mobilization efforts were highly enthusiastic; however, it turned into apathy later. As World War I broke out, national societies representing ethnic Czechs and Slovaks residing in the Russian Empire petitioned the Russian government to support the independence of their homelands. To prove their loyalty to the Entente cause, these groups advocated the establishment of a unit of Czech and Slovak volunteers to fight alongside the Russian Army.


On 5 August 1914, the Russian Stavka authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. This unit, called the &quot;Companions&quot; (&quot;Družina&quot;), went to the front in October 1914, where it was attached to the Russian Third Army. There the &quot;Družina&quot; soldiers served in scattered patrols performing a number of specialized duties, including reconnaissance, prisoner interrogation and subversion of enemy troops in the opposite trenches.

From its start, Czech and Slovak political émigrés in Russia and Western Europe desired to expand the &quot;Družina&quot; from a battalion into a formidable military formation. To achieve this goal, they recognized that they would need to recruit from Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the &quot;Družina&quot; to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian Army, but this order was rescinded after only a few weeks due to opposition from other branches of the Russian government. Despite continuous efforts of émigré leaders to persuade the Russian authorities to change their mind, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917. Still, some Czechs and Slovaks were able to sidestep this ban by enlisting POWs through local agreements with Russian military authorities.
Under these conditions, the Czechoslovak unit in Russia grew very slowly from 1914 to 1917. In early 1916, the &quot;Družina&quot; was reorganized as the 1st Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. During that year, two more infantry regiments were added, creating the Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade (&quot;Československá střelecká brigáda&quot;). This unit distinguished itself during the Kerensky Offensive in July 1917, when the Czecho-Slovak troops overran Austrian trenches during the Battle of Zborov.

Following the soldiers&#x27; stellar performance at Zborov, the Russian Provisional Government finally granted their émigré leaders on the Czechoslovak National Council permission to mobilize Czech, Moravian and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer, a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (&quot;Československý sbor na Rusi&quot;), also known as the Czechoslovak Legion (&quot;Československá legie&quot;) in Russia. A second division, consisting of four regiments, was added to the Legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 troops by 1918.

===In France===
In France, the Czechs and the Slovaks who wanted to fight Austria-Hungary were allowed to join the Foreign Legion, hence originated the term &quot;Legion&quot; for units of Czechoslovak volunteers. On 31 August 1914, the 1st Company of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the Foreign Legion in Bayonne was created mostly of the Czechs and was nicknamed &quot;rota Nazdar&quot; (&quot;Nazdar!&quot; Company). The company distinguished itself in heavy combat during assaults near Arras on May 9 and June 16, 1915. Because of heavy casualties, the company was disbanded, and volunteers continued to fight in various French units.

New autonomous Czechoslovak units were established by the decree of the French government on 19 December 1917. In January 1918, the 21st Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment was formed in the town of Cognac; it mixed prisoners of war with volunteers living in America. The 22nd Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment was created later in May.
===In Italy===
The creation of Czechoslovak units in Italy took place much later than in France or Russia. In January 1918, the commander of 6th Italian Army decided to form small reconnaissance groups from Czech, Moravian Slovak and Southern Slav volunteers from prisoner-of-war camps. They also served in propaganda actions against the Austrian army. In September 1918 the first fighting unit, the 39th Regiment of the Czechoslovak Italian Legion, was formed from those volunteer reconnaissance squadrons.

Czechoslovak legionaries in Italy were the first to return to newly created Czechoslovakia in 1918 and were immediately drafted into fights for new state borders, most notably in the war against the Hungarian Soviet Republic.

===Table of units involved in World War I===

===Flags used by the Legion===
Flags of legions’ regiments were white and red with embroidered symbols of the Czech countries and Slovakia, linden twigs, St. Wenceslas’ crown, letters “ S”, and Hussite themes.

The reverse side of the Russian legion&#x27;s flag showed national colors for the Russian command, and Czech and Slovak colors for the Czechs and Slovaks.
The National Council of Czechoslovakia in exile, which led the anti-Austrian resistance, became the interim government on 26 September 1918 with the consent of France, Great Britain, and the US.
The first ceremonial hoisting of the Czechoslovak flag on the house inhabited by T. G. Masaryk, the head of the interim government, took place on 18 October 1918. Based on the historical flag of Bohemia, the Czechoslovak flag was defined as the connection of two stripes, i.e. a white one above a red one.

==Russian Civil War==

===Evacuation from Bolshevik Russia===

In November 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power throughout Russia and soon began peace negotiations with the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk. The chairman of the Czechoslovak National Council, Tomáš Masaryk, who had arrived in Russia earlier that year, began planning for the Legion&#x27;s departure from Russia and transfer to France so the Czechoslovaks could continue to fight against the Central Powers. Since most of Russia&#x27;s main ports were blockaded, Masaryk decided that the Legion should travel from Ukraine to the Pacific port of Vladivostok, where the men would embark on transport vessels that would carry them to Western Europe.

In February 1918, Bolshevik authorities in Ukraine granted Masaryk and his troops permission to begin the journey to Vladivostok. On 18 February, before the Czechoslovaks had left Ukraine, the German Army launched Operation Faustschlag (fist strike) on the Eastern Front to force the Soviet government to accept its terms for peace. From 5 to 13 March, the Czechoslovak legionaries successfully fought off German attempts to prevent their evacuation in the Battle of Bakhmach.

After leaving Ukraine and entering Soviet Russia, representatives of the Czechoslovak National Council continued to negotiate with Bolshevik authorities in Moscow and Penza to iron out the details of the corps&#x27; evacuation. On 25 March, the two sides signed the Penza Agreement, in which the legionaries were to surrender most of their weapons in exchange for unmolested passage to Vladivostok. Tensions continued to mount, as each side distrusted the other. The Bolsheviks, despite Masaryk&#x27;s order for the legionaries to remain neutral in Russia&#x27;s affairs, suspected that the Czechoslovaks might join their counterrevolutionary enemies in the borderlands. Meanwhile, the legionaries were wary of Czechoslovak Communists who were trying to subvert the corps. They also suspected that the Bolsheviks were being pressured by the Central Powers to stall their movement towards Vladivostok.

By May 1918, the Czechoslovak Legion was strung out along the Trans-Siberian Railway from Penza to Vladivostok. Their evacuation was proving much slower than expected due to dilapidated railway conditions, a shortage of locomotives and the recurring need to negotiate with local soviets along the route. On 14 May, a dispute at the Chelyabinsk station between legionaries heading east and Magyar POWs heading west to be repatriated caused the People&#x27;s Commissar for War, Leon Trotsky, to order the complete disarmament and arrest of the legionaries. At an army congress that convened in Chelyabinsk a few days later, the Czechoslovaks – against the wishes of the National Council – refused to disarm and began issuing ultimatums for their passage to Vladivostok. This incident sparked the Revolt of the Legions.

Fighting between the Czechoslovak Legion and the Bolsheviks erupted at several points along the Trans-Siberian Railway in the last days of May 1918. By June, the two sides were fighting along the railway route from Penza to Krasnoyarsk. By the end of the month, legionaries under General Mikhail Diterikhs had taken control of Vladivostok, overthrowing the local Bolshevik administration. On July 6, the Legion declared the city to be an Allied protectorate, and legionnaires began returning across the Trans-Siberian Railway to support their comrades fighting to their west. Generally, the Czechoslovaks were the victors in their early engagements against the fledgling Red Army.

By mid-July, the legionaries had seized control of the railway from Samara to Irkutsk, and by the beginning of September they had cleared Bolshevik forces from the entire length of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Legionnaires conquered all the large cities of Siberia, including Yekaterinburg, but Tsar Nicholas II and his family were executed on the direct orders of Yakov Sverdlov less than a week before the arrival of the Legion.

===Involvement in the Russian Civil War, 1918–1919===
News of the Czechoslovak Legion&#x27;s campaign in Siberia during the summer of 1918 was welcomed by Allied statesmen in Great Britain and France, who saw the operation as a means to reconstitute an eastern front against Germany. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who had resisted earlier Allied proposals to intervene in Russia, gave in to domestic and foreign pressure to support the legionaries&#x27; evacuation from Siberia. In early July 1918, he published an aide-mémoire calling for a limited intervention in Siberia by the U.S. and Japan to rescue the Czechoslovak troops, who were then blocked by Bolshevik forces in Transbaikal. But by the time most American and Japanese units landed in Vladivostok, the Czechoslovaks were already there to welcome them.

The Czechoslovak Legion&#x27;s campaign in Siberia impressed Allied statesmen and attracted them to the idea of an independent Czechoslovak state. As the legionaries cruised from one victory to another that summer, the Czechoslovak National Council began receiving official statements of recognition from various Allied governments.

====Capture of Imperial gold reserve====

Shortly after they entered into hostilities against the Bolsheviks, the legionaries began making common cause with anti-Bolshevik Russians who began forming their own governments behind the Czechoslovaks&#x27; lines. The most important of these governments were the Komuch, led by the Social Revolutionaries, in Samara and the Provisional Siberian Government in Omsk. With substantial Czechoslovak help, the People&#x27;s Army of Komuch won several important victories, including the capture of Kazan and an Imperial state gold reserve on 6–7 August 1918. Czechoslovak pressure was also crucial in convincing the anti-Bolshevik forces in Siberia to nominally unify behind the All-Russian Provisional Government, formed at a conference in Ufa during September 1918.

During the autumn of 1918, the legionaries&#x27; enthusiasm for the fighting in Russia, then mostly confined along the Volga and Urals, dropped precipitously. The professor T. G. Masaryk supported them from the United States of America. The rapidly growing Red Army was getting stronger by the day, retaking Kazan on 10 September, followed by Samara a month later. The legionaries, whose strength had peaked at around 61,000 earlier that year, were lacking reliable reinforcements from POW camps and were disappointed by the failure of Allied soldiers from other countries to join them on the front lines.

On 28 October, Czechoslovak statehood was declared in Prague, arousing the troops with a desire to return to their homeland. The final blow to Czechoslovak morale arrived on 18 November 1918, when a coup in Omsk overthrew the All-Russian Provisional Government and installed a dictatorship under Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in control of White Siberia. 

During the winter of 1918–1919, the Czechoslovak troops were redeployed from the front to guard the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway between Novonikolaevsk and Irkutsk from partisan attacks. Alongside other legions formed from Polish, Romanian and Yugoslav POWs in Siberia, the Czechoslovaks defended the Kolchak government&#x27;s only supply route for the duration of 1919.

====Betrayal of the White Russians====

During the summer and autumn of 1919, Kolchak&#x27;s armies were in a steady retreat from the Red Eastern Army Group. On 14 November, the Reds took Omsk, Kolchak&#x27;s capital, initiating a desperate eastward flight by the White army and refugees along the Trans-Siberian Railway. In the following weeks, the Whites&#x27; rear was further disorganized by widespread outbreaks of uprisings and partisan activity. The homesick legionaries, who simply wanted to leave Siberia without incurring any more casualties than necessary, declared their neutrality amid the unrest and did nothing to suppress the rebellions.

Meanwhile, Kolchak&#x27;s trains, which included the gold bullion captured from Kazan, were stranded along the railway near Nizhneudinsk. After his bodyguard deserted him there, the legionaries were ordered by Allied representatives in Siberia to convey him to the British military mission in Irkutsk. This plan was resisted by insurgents along the Czechoslovaks&#x27; route, and as a result the legionaries, after consulting their commanders, Generals Janin and Jan Syrový, made the controversial decision to turn Kolchak over to the Political Center, a government formed by Socialists-Revolutionaries in Irkutsk.

On 7 February 1920, the legionaries had signed an armistice with the Fifth Red Army at Kutin, whereby the latter allowed the Czechoslovaks unmolested passage to Vladivostok. In exchange, the legionaries agreed not to try to rescue Kolchak, and to leave the remaining gold bullion with the authorities in Irkutsk. Earlier that day, Kolchak had been executed by a Cheka firing squad to prevent his rescue by a small White army then on the outskirts of the city. His body was dumped under the ice of the frozen Angara River and never recovered.

When the White Army learned about the execution, its remaining leadership decided to withdraw farther east. The Great Siberian Ice March followed. The Red Army did not enter Irkutsk until 7 March, and only then was the news of Kolchak&#x27;s death officially released. Because of this, and also because of an attempted rebellion against the Whites, organized by Radola Gajda in Vladivostok on 17 November 1919, the Whites accused the Czechoslovaks of treason, but were too weak to act against them.
===Evacuation from Vladivostok, 1920===

When the armistice with the Bolsheviks was concluded, dozens of Czechoslovak trains were still west of Irkutsk. On 1 March 1920, the last Czechoslovak train passed through that city. The legionaries&#x27; progress was still hampered at times by the Japanese Expeditionary Force and the troops of Ataman Grigori Semenov, who stalled the Czechoslovak trains to delay the arrival of the Red Army in Eastern Siberia. By then the evacuation of Czechoslovak troops from Vladivostok was well underway, and the last legionaries left the port in September 1920.

The total number of people evacuated with the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia was 67,739; including 56,455 soldiers, 3,004 officers, 6,714 civilians, 1,716 wives, 717 children, 1,935 foreigners and 198 others. After their return to Czechoslovakia, many formed the core of the new Czechoslovak Army.

The number of legionaries killed in Russia during World War I and the Russian Civil War was 4,112. An unknown number went missing or deserted the legion, either to make an arduous journey to return home or to join the Czechoslovak Communists. Among the latter was Jaroslav Hašek, later the author of the satirical novel &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;.

====Evacuation====
A total of 36 transports were dispatched from Vladivostok.

* The Allies provided 21 shipsUnited States 12, Britain 9. Two ships were provided by the American Red Cross. The ships &quot;President Grant&quot; and &quot;Heffron&quot; made all or part of the journey twice.
* 12 ships were chartered by the Centrocommission; 9683 people were taken away. Two Japanese ships and one Russian were chartered for cargo. For the transport of people, boats were bought or rented mainly in Japan (7), China (1) and Russia (1). The first ship dispatched by the Centro-Commission was the Japanese &quot;Liverpool-Maru&quot;, sailing on July 8, 1919. The regular transport of legionnaires and partially disabled people began on December 9, 1919, with the transport of the 1st Regiment on the &quot;Jonan-Maru&quot;. The last ship with people was the &quot;Nizhny Novgorod&quot;, which sailed on February 13, 1920. The last ship with cargo was the &quot;Shunko-Maru&quot;, which sailed from Vladivostok on May 14, 1920.
* The first ship to take the first Siberian legionnaires from Vladivostok was the Italian &quot;Roma&quot; on January 15, 1919, and the last was the &quot;Heffron&quot; on September 2, 1920. The first ships sailed to Naples and Marseille. Others passed through the Panama Canal, others to North America, others to Canada with the final port of Hamburg. The whole evacuation took 1 year and 8 months.

==Postwar==

Czechoslovakia declared its independence from the disintegrating Austria-Hungary on 28 October 1918 with now President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk of the Czechoslovak Republic. Members of the Legions formed a significant part of the new Czechoslovak Army. A French military mission began in Czech territories after January 1919, led by General Maurice Pellé. After some disagreements with the Italian-led Czechs in Slovakia, President Masaryk eventually replaced Piccione with Pellé on July 4, 1919, and essentially ended the Italian connection to the Legion.

The French military mission&#x27;s role was to integrate the existing Czechoslovak Foreign Legions with the home units of the Army and develop a professional command structure. On October 15, 1919, the main staff of the Czechoslovak Army was officially formed. French officers were installed as territorial commanders and commanders of some divisions. Over the course of time, there were 200 French non-commissioned officers, over 100 commissioned officers and 19 Generals. General Pellé and his immediate replacement, General Eugène Mittelhauser (also French), were the first chiefs staff of the Czechoslovak Army.

The Legion took part in the Hungarian–Czechoslovak War. On January 1, 1919, Legion troops took control of the city of Bratislava and Italian Colonel Riccardo Barreca was appointed military commander of the city. Several clashes (which killed at least nine Hungarian demonstrators) took place and Barreca himself was injured. The Italian officers continued to assist in the operations against the Hungarians during the war. Many veterans of the legion also fought in the Polish–Czechoslovak War.

Legion veterans formed organizations such as the Association of Czechoslovak Legionnaires (&quot;Československá obec legionářská&quot;) and Legiobanka (&quot;Legionářská banka&quot;, a bank formed with the capital they had gathered during their long service).
These and other organizations were known as the &quot;Hrad&quot; (&quot;The [Prague] Castle&quot;) for their support of the President of Czechoslovakia.

===In literature===
The 2005 novel &quot;The People&#x27;s Act of Love&quot;, by the British writer James Meek, describes the occupation of a small Siberian town by a company of the Czechoslovak Legion in 1919. The original inhabitants of the town are members of the Christian sect of Skoptsy, or castrates.

A memoir &quot;Přál jsem si míti křídla&quot; by Jozef Dufka was published in magazine &quot;Zvuk&quot; during 1996-1999 and as a book in 2002 ().

Gustav Becvar (August Wenzel Engelbert (Gustav) Bečvář) published his memoir &quot;The Lost Legion&quot; in English in 1939.

===In art===

Two postage stamps, issued in 1919, were printed for use by Czechoslovak Legion in Siberia.
The flag of the Czechoslovak Legion can be seen in the Allies in the monumental painting Pantheon de la Guerre.

The Mounted Patrol (Jízdní hlídka in Czech) is a 1936 Czechoslovak movie and drama about a skirmish of the Czechoslovak Legion with bolsheviks in Siberia.

&quot;Last Train Home&quot; is a real-time tactics video game developed by Ashborne Games, in which the player controls a train carrying Czechoslovak Legion troops along the Trans-Siberian Railway during their withdrawal. The game was released on 28 November 2023.

The river flows generally west from a source in the Appalachian Mountains to its confluence with the Ohio River near Paducah, Kentucky, and the mouth of the Tennessee River. Major tributaries include the Obey, Caney Fork, Stones, and Red Rivers.

Although the Cumberland River basin is predominantly rural, there are also some large cities on the river, including Nashville and Clarksville, both in Tennessee. 

The river system has been extensively altered for flood control. Major dams impound areas of both the main stem and many of its important tributaries.

==Geography==
Its headwaters are three separate forks that begin in Kentucky and converge in Baxter, KY, located in Harlan County. Martin&#x27;s Fork starts near Hensley Settlement on Brush Mountain in Bell County and snakes its way north through the mountains to Baxter. Clover Fork starts on Black Mountain in Holmes Mill, near the Virginia border, and flows west in parallel with Kentucky Route 38 until it reaches Harlan. 

Clover Fork once flowed through downtown Harlan and merged with Martins Fork at what is now the intersection of Kentucky Route 38 and US Route 421. A flood control project begun in 1992 diverted it through a tunnel under Little Black Mountain, from which it emerges in Baxter and converges with Martins Fork. Poor Fork begins as a small stream on Pine Mountain in Letcher County near Flat Gap, Virginia. It flows southwest in parallel with Pine Mountain until it merges with the other two forks in Baxter.
From there, the wider river, now named Cumberland, continues flowing west through the mountains of Kentucky before turning northward toward Cumberland Falls. The falls is one of the largest waterfalls in the southeastern United States and is one of the few places in the Western Hemisphere where a moonbow can be seen.

Beyond Cumberland Falls, the river turns abruptly west once again and continues to expand as other creeks and streams feed into it. It receives the Laurel and Rockcastle rivers from the northeast, followed by the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River from the south. From here it flows into the man-made Lake Cumberland, formed by Wolf Creek Dam. The more than reservoir is one of the largest artificial lakes in the eastern US.

Near Celina, Tennessee, the river crosses south into that state, where it is joined by the Obey River and Caney Fork. Northeast of Nashville, the river is dammed twice more, forming Cordell Hull Lake and Old Hickory Lake. After flowing through Nashville and picking up the Stones River, the river is dammed to form Cheatham Lake. The river turns northwest toward Clarksville, where it is joined by the Red River. 

It flows back into Kentucky at the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, a section of land nestled between Lake Barkley, which is fed by the Cumberland River, and Kentucky Lake. Finally, the river flows north and merges with the Ohio River at Smithland, northeast of Paducah.

==History==
The explorer Thomas Walker of Virginia in 1758 named the river, but whether for the Duke of Cumberland or the English county of Cumberland is not known.

The Cumberland River was called &quot;Wasioto&quot; by the Shawnee Native Americans, who lived in this area. French traders called it the &quot;Riviere des Chaouanons&quot;, or &quot;River of the Shawnee&quot; for this association. The river was also known as the &quot;Shawnee River&quot; (or &quot;Shawanoe River&quot;) for years after Walker&#x27;s trip.

Important first as a passage for hunters and settlers, the Cumberland River also supported later riverboat trade, which traveled to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Villages, towns, and cities were located at landing points along its banks. Through the middle of the 19th century, settlers depended on rivers as the primary transportation routes for trading and travel.

=== Floods ===
In more recent history, a number of severe floods have struck various regions that the river flows through. In April 1977, Harlan, Kentucky, and many surrounding communities were inundated with floodwaters, destroying most of the homes and businesses within the floodplain of the river. This event led to the building of the Martins Fork Dam for flood control and the diversion of the Clover Fork around the city of Harlan. In addition, the river was diverted through a mountain cut in Loyall, Kentucky.

In late April and early May 2010, due to the 2010 Tennessee floods, the river overflowed its banks and flooded Nashville and Clarksville, Tennessee. The downtown area was ordered to evacuate.

Major flooding occurred along the Cumberland River at Pineville, Barbourville, and Williamsburg in early February 2020.

<text>Laurence Gardner (17 May 1943 – 12 August 2010) was a British author and lecturer. He wrote on various topics including historical-religious speculation such as the Jesus bloodline.

==Biography==
Laurence Gardner was born Barry Laurence Gardner in Hackney, London. He was married to Angela and they had one child together and two children from a previous marriage. He was a stockbroker before becoming an author. Gardner was also an artistic painter, working alone and with Canadian artist Peter Robson, and was also known in the United States for his radio telephone-ins.
He was involved with the AngloAmerican Lorna Doone Society, Dulverton, UK, along with Dr.Whitman Pearson USA and both were instrumental in commissioning the Lorna Doone statue that stands at the Exmoor NP entrance, Dulverton. His first books, authored as Barry Gardner, were &quot;Who Was Lorna Doone&quot; 1989 Brendon Arts Limited and &quot;Lorna Doone&#x27;s Exmoor&quot; 1990 B.A.L. (Ref.Lorna&#x27;s Author: A Statue and a Stone 2019 David Blackmore, Blackmore Books, Chester,UK) It is notable that Gardner&#x27;s later work,Bloodline, is dedicated to Pearson.
Gardner&#x27;s book &quot;Bloodline of the Holy Grail&quot; was published during 1996. The book was serialized in &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; and was a best seller. He used his books to propose several theories, including a belief that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had married and had children, whose descendants included King Arthur and the House of Stuart. In &quot;Lost Secrets of the Sacred Ark&quot; he claimed that the Ark of the Covenant was a machine for manufacturing &quot;monatomic gold&quot; – a supposed elixir which could be used to extend life. His books also included theories about Freemasonry, the Knights Templar, the Holy Grail, and proposed connections between Atenism and Judaism.

Gardner referred to himself as &quot;Chevalier Labhran de Saint Germain&quot;, and &quot;Presidential Attaché to the European Council of Princes&quot; (the existence of which cannot be verified) also &quot;Prior of the Celtic Churches Sacred Kindred of Saint Columba&quot;. He also claimed to be Jacobite Historiographer Royal of the Royal House of Stewart. He was an endorser of Michel Roger Lafosse, in particular his claims to be descended from the House of Stuart, which Gardner claimed was descended from Jesus Christ. Some historians and scholars regard him as a conspiracy theorist, and treat his work as pseudohistory. Lafosse&#x27;s claims have been dismissed.

Gardner was interviewed for the Killing Joke music documentary film later released in 2013, &quot;The Death and Resurrection Show&quot;, in which he stated that, &quot;The Christian God is an Extraterrestrial&quot;.

Gardner died on 12 August 2010 after a prolonged illness. His book, &quot;The Origin of God&quot;, was published in 2010 as a print on demand book from the Dash House Publishing Company, established by his widow. It is described as &quot;a biographical exploration of the deiform character variously known as Yahweh, Allah, or simply The Lord. It seeks to uncover and evaluate his original identity...&quot;. His final book &quot;Revelation of the Devil&quot;, a companion to &quot;The Origin of God&quot;, was published by Dash in 2012.

<text>Simulink is a MATLAB-based graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain dynamical systems. Its primary interface is a graphical block diagramming tool and a customizable set of block libraries. It offers tight integration with the rest of the MATLAB environment and can either drive MATLAB or be scripted from it. Simulink is widely used in automatic control and digital signal processing for multidomain simulation and model-based design.

== Add-on products ==
MathWorks and other third-party hardware and software products can be used with Simulink. For example, Stateflow extends Simulink with a design environment for developing state machines and flow charts.

Coupled with another of their products, Simulink can automatically generate C source code for real-time implementation of systems. As the efficiency and flexibility of the code improves, this is becoming more widely adopted for production systems, in addition to being a tool for embedded system design work because of its flexibility and capacity for quick iteration. Embedded Coder creates code efficient enough for use in embedded systems.

Simulink Real-Time (formerly known as xPC Target), together with x86-based real-time systems, is an environment for simulating and testing Simulink and Stateflow models in real-time on the physical system. Another MathWorks product also supports specific embedded targets. When used with other generic products, Simulink and Stateflow can automatically generate synthesizable VHDL and Verilog.
Simulink Verification and Validation enables systematic verification and validation of models through modeling style checking, requirements traceability and model coverage analysis. Simulink Design Verifier uses formal methods to identify design errors like integer overflow, division by zero and dead logic, and generates test case scenarios for model checking within the Simulink environment.

SimEvents is used to add a library of graphical building blocks for modeling queuing systems to the Simulink environment, and to add an event-based simulation engine to the time-based simulation engine in Simulink.

<text>The MathWorks, Inc. is an American privately held corporation that specializes in mathematical computing software. Its major products include MATLAB and Simulink, which support data analysis and simulation.

==History==
MATLAB was created in the 1970s by Cleve Moler, who was chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico at the time. It was a free tool for academics. Jack Little, who would eventually set up the company, came across the tool while he was a graduate student in electrical engineering at Stanford University.

Little and Steve Bangert rewrote the code for MATLAB in C while they were colleagues at an engineering firm. They founded MathWorks along with Moler in 1984, with Little running it out of his house in Portola Valley, California. Little would mail diskettes in baggies (food storage bags) to the first customers. The company sold its first order, 10 copies of MATLAB, for $500 to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in February 1985. A few years later, Little and the company moved to Massachusetts. There, Little hired Jeanne O&#x27;Keefe, an experienced computer executive, to help formalize the business. By 1997, MathWorks was profitable, claiming revenue of around $50 million, and had around 380 employees. 
In 1999, MathWorks relocated to the Apple Hill office complex in Natick, Massachusetts, purchasing additional buildings in the complex in 2008 and 2009, ultimately occupying the entire campus. MathWorks expanded further in 2013 by buying Boston Scientific&#x27;s old headquarters campus, which is near to MathWorks&#x27; headquarters in Natick.

By 2018, the company had around 3,000 employees in Natick and said it had revenues of around $900 million.

==Products==
The company&#x27;s two lead products are MATLAB, which provides an environment for scientists, engineers and programmers to analyze and visualize data and develop algorithms, and Simulink, a graphical and simulation environment for model-based design of dynamic systems. MATLAB and Simulink are used in aerospace, automotive, software and other fields. The company&#x27;s other products include Polyspace, SimEvents, Stateflow, and ThingSpeak.

==Corporate affairs==
===Intellectual property and competition===
In 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against MathWorks and Wind River Systems alleging that an agreement between them violated antitrust laws. The agreement in question stipulated that the two companies agreed to stop competing in the field of dynamic control system design software, with MathWorks alone selling Wind River&#x27;s MATRIXx Software and that Wind River would stop all research and development and sales in that field. Both companies eventually settled with the Department of Justice and agreed to sell the MATRIXx software to a third party. MathWorks had total sales of $200 million in 2001, with dynamic control system design software accounting for half of those sales.

MathWorks&#x27;s Simulink software was found to have infringed 3 patents from National Instruments related to data flow diagrams in 2003, a decision which was confirmed by a court of appeal in 2004.

In 2011, MathWorks sued AccelerEyes for copyright infringement in one court, and patent and trademark infringement in another. AccelerEyes accepted consent decrees in both cases before the trials began.

In 2012, the European Commission opened an antitrust investigation into MathWorks after competitors alleged that MathWorks refused to grant licenses to its intellectual property that would allow people to create software with interoperability with its products. The case was closed in 2014 without filing any charge.

===Logo===
The logo represents the first vibrational mode of a thin L-shaped membrane, clamped at the edges, and governed by the wave equation, which was the subject of Moler&#x27;s thesis.

===Community===
The company annually sponsors a number of student engineering competitions, including EcoCAR, an advanced vehicle technology competition created by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and General Motors (GM). MathWorks sponsored the mathematics exhibit at London&#x27;s Science Museum.

In the coding community, MathWorks hosts MATLAB Central, an online exchange where users ask and answer questions and share code. MATLAB Central currently houses around than 145,000 questions in its MATLAB Answers database. The company actively supports numerous academic institutions to advance STEM education (primarily through the use of MathWorks products), including giving funding to MIT Open Courseware and MITx.

<text>Cleve Barry Moler (born August 17, 1939) is an American mathematician and computer programmer specializing in numerical analysis. In the mid to late 1970s, he was one of the authors of LINPACK and EISPACK, Fortran libraries for numerical computing. He created MATLAB, a numerical computing package, to give his students at the University of New Mexico easy access to these libraries without writing Fortran. In 1984, he co-founded MathWorks with Jack Little to commercialize this program.

==Biography==
He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from California Institute of Technology in 1961, and a Ph.D. in 1965 from Stanford University, both in mathematics. He worked for Charles Lawson at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1961 and 1962.

He was a professor of mathematics and computer science for almost 20 years at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the University of New Mexico. Before joining MathWorks full-time in 1989, he also worked for Intel Hypercube, where he coined the term &quot;embarrassingly parallel&quot;, and Ardent Computer Corporation. He is also co-author of four textbooks on numerical methods and is a member of the Association for Computing Machinery. He was president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics 2007–2008.

He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering on February 14, 1997, for conceiving and developing widely used mathematical software. He received an honorary degree from Linköping University, Sweden. He received an honorary degree of Doctor of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo in 2001. On April 30, 2004, he was appointed Honorary Doctor () at the Technical University of Denmark. In 2009, he was recognized by Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics as a SIAM Fellow for his outstanding contributions to numerical analysis and software, including the invention of MATLAB. In April 2012, the IEEE Computer Society named Cleve the recipient of the 2012 Computer Pioneer Award. In February 2014, IEEE named Cleve the recipient of the 2014 IEEE John von Neumann Medal. In April 2017, he was made Fellow of the Computer History Museum.

<text>François Auguste Ferdinand Mariette (11 February 182118 January 1881) was a French scholar, archaeologist and Egyptologist, and the founder of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities, the forerunner of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.

==Early career==
Auguste Mariette was born in Boulogne-sur-Mer, where his father was town clerk. Educated at the Boulogne municipal college, where he distinguished himself and showed much artistic talent, he went to England in 1839 when eighteen as professor of French and drawing at a boys&#x27; school at Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1840 he became pattern-designer to a ribbon manufacturer in Coventry, but he returned the same year to Boulogne, and in 1841 took a degree at the University of Douai. Mariette proved to be a talented draftsman and designer, and he supplemented his salary as a teacher at Douai by giving private lessons and writing on historical and archaeological subjects for local periodicals.

Meanwhile, his cousin Nestor L&#x27;Hôte, the friend and fellow-traveller of Champollion, died, and the task of sorting his papers filled Mariette with a passion for Egyptology. Largely self-taught, he devoted himself to the study of hieroglyphs and Coptic. His 1847 analytic catalogue of the Egyptian Gallery of the Boulogne Museum got him a minor appointment at the Louvre Museum in 1849.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1869.

==First trip to Egypt==

Entrusted with a government mission for the purpose of seeking and purchasing the best Coptic, Syriac, Arabic and Ethiopic manuscripts for the Louvre collection so that it retained its then-supremacy over other national collections, he set out for Egypt in 1850.

After little success in acquiring manuscripts due to inexperience, to avoid an embarrassing return empty-handed to France and wasting what might be his only trip to Egypt, he visited temples and befriended a Bedouin tribe, who led him to Saqqara. The site initially looked &quot;a spectacle of desolation...[and] mounds of sand&quot; (his words), but on noticing one sphinx from the reputed avenue of sphinxes, that led to the ruins of the Serapeum of Saqqara near the step-pyramid, with its head above the sands, he gathered 30 workmen. Thus, in 1851, he made his celebrated discovery of this avenue and eventually the subterranean tomb-temple complex of catacombs with their spectacular sarcophagi of the Apis bulls. Breaking through the rubble at the tomb entrance on November 12, he entered the complex, finding thousands of statues, bronze tablets and other treasures, but only one intact sarcophagus. He also found the virtually intact tomb of Prince Khaemweset, Ramesses II&#x27;s son.

Accused of theft and destruction by rival diggers and by the Egyptian authorities, Mariette began to rebury his finds in the desert to keep them from these competitors. Instead of manuscripts, official French funds were now advanced for the prosecution of his researches, and he remained in Egypt for four years, excavating, discovering and despatching archaeological treasures to the Louvre, following the accepted Eurocentric convention. However, the French government and the Louvre set up an arrangement to divide the finds 50:50 with Egypt, so that upon his return to Paris 230 crates went to the Louvre (and he was raised to an assistant conservator), but an equal amount remained in Egypt.

==Director of Antiquities==

After his discoveries at Saqqara, Mariette could not be content with a purely academic role. He said: &quot;I knew I would die or go mad if I did not return to Egypt immediately&quot; and, after less than a year, he returned to Egypt at the insistence of the Egyptian government under Sa&#x27;id of Egypt, who created the position of Conservator of Egyptian monuments for him, in 1858.

Moving with his family to Cairo, Mariette&#x27;s career blossomed into a chronicle of unwearying exploration and brilliant successes: 
*gaining government funds open the museum in Cairo at Bulaq in 1863 in order to take the pressure off the sites and stop the trade in illicit antiquities.
*the pyramid-fields of Memphis and (exploiting his previous success to find a cache of ca. 2000BC painted wooden statues such as the Seated Scribe) the tombs of Saqqara
*the necropolis of Meidum, and those of Abydos and Thebes
*the great temples of Dendera and Edfu were disinterred
*important excavations were carried out at Karnak (marking the first full Egyptian use of the stratigraphic methods first developed by Karl Richard Lepsius and of photographing every object prior to its excavation), Medinet-Habu and Deir el-Bahri
*Tanis (the Egyptian capital in the Late Period) was partially explored in the Delta
*even Gebel Barkal in Sudan was explored
*He cleared the sands around the Sphinx down to the bare rock, and in the process discovered the famous granite and alabaster monument, the &quot;Temple of the Sphinx&quot;.

In 1860 alone, Mariette set up 35 new dig sites, whilst attempting to conserve already-dug sites. His success was aided by the fact that no rivals were permitted to dig in Egypt, a fact that the British (who had previously had the majority of Egyptologists active in the country) and Germans (who were politically allied with the country&#x27;s Ottoman rulers) protested at as a &#x27;sweetheart deal&#x27; between Egypt and France. Nor were Mariette&#x27;s relations with the Khedive always stable. The Khedive, like many potentates, assumed all discoveries ranked as treasure and that what went to the museum in Cairo went only at his pleasure. Even early on, in February 1859, Mariette dashed to Thebes to confiscate a boatload of antiquities from the nearby tomb of Queen Ahhotep I that were to have been sent to the Khedive.

In his position as Director of the Antiquities Service, Mariette made concerted efforts to stifle the careers of Egyptians such as Ahmad Kamal within the Service. Heinrich Brugsch, a German philologist documented how Mariette was suspicious of Egyptians and forbade Egyptians from copying hieroglyphs in the Cairo Museum. Mariette was concerned, Brugsch states, that Egyptians might be appointed into official positions within the Museum and was dedicated to stopping that from occurring.

In 1867, he returned to oversee the ancient Egyptian stand at the Exposition Universelle, to a hero&#x27;s welcome for keeping France pre-eminent in Egyptology. In 1869, at the request of the Khedive, he wrote a brief plot for an opera. The following year this concept, worked into a scenario by Camille du Locle, was proposed to Giuseppe Verdi, who accepted it as a subject for &quot;Aida&quot;. For &quot;Aida,&quot; Mariette and Du Locle oversaw the scenery and costumes, which were inspired by the art of Ancient Egypt. The premiere of &quot;Aida&quot; was originally scheduled for February 1871, but was delayed until 24 December 1871, due to the siege of Paris at the height of the Franco-Prussian War (which trapped Mariette with the costumes and scenery in Paris). The opera met with great acclaim.

Mariette was raised successively to the rank of bey and pasha, and European honors and orders were bestowed on him.

In 1878, his museum was ravaged by floods, which destroyed most of his notes and drawings. By the spring of 1881, prematurely aged and nearly blind, Mariette arranged for the appointment of the Frenchman Gaston Maspero (a linguist rather than an archaeologist, who he had met at the Exposition in 1867), to ensure that France retained its supremacy in Egyptology in Egypt, rather than an Englishman.

==Death==

He died in Cairo and was interred in a sarcophagus which is on display in the Garden of the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.

The bust of other famous Egyptologists, including Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, have been placed on a semi-circular memorial around the sarcophagus.

Though not all his discoveries were thoroughly published, the list of his publications is a long one.

<text>Stateflow (developed by MathWorks) is a control logic tool used to model reactive systems via state machines and flow charts within a Simulink model. Stateflow uses a variant of the finite-state machine notation established by David Harel, enabling the representation of hierarchy, parallelism and history within a state chart. Stateflow also provides state transition tables and truth tables.

==Common uses==
Stateflow is generally used to specify the discrete controller in the model of a hybrid system where the continuous dynamics (i.e., the behavior of the plant and environment) are specified using Simulink.

Specific applications for Stateflow include:
* Mode logic, where each discrete mode of a system is represented by a state
* Fault management, where the Stateflow chart is used to control how the system responds to faults and failures within a system
* Task scheduling, where the Stateflow chart is used to schedule when specific tasks occur, either within the Stateflow chart or within the overall Simulink model

==Extensions==
A number of MathWorks and third-party tools can be used with Stateflow to validate the design and generate code. For example, Simulink Verification and Validation, a MathWorks tool, can be used to check for requirements traceability and model coverage analysis. Other add-on code generation tools can be used to automatically generate C, C++, HDL, and PLC code for implementation on embedded systems.

<doc id="562720" wikidata="Q548754" url="?curid=562720" title="Greeneye">
<text>Greeneyes are deep-sea aulopiform marine fishes in the small family Chlorophthalmidae. Thought to have a circumglobal distribution in tropical and temperate waters, the family contains just 18 species in two genera. The family name Chlorophthalmidae derives from the Greek words &quot;chloros&quot; meaning &quot;green&quot; and &quot;ophthalmos&quot; meaning &quot;eye&quot;.

Some species are of interest to commercial and subsistence fisheries; the fish are made into fish meal or sold fresh.

The earliest known member of the group is &quot;Acrognathus&quot; from the Cenomanian. Another potential fossil genus, &quot;Iniomus&quot;, is known from the Late Eocene of California.

== Description ==
Aptly named after their disproportionately large, iridescent (as well as fluorescent) eyes, greeneyes are slender fish with slightly compressed bodies. The largest species, the Shortnose greeneye (&quot;Chlorophthalmus agassizi&quot;) reaches a length of , but most other species are much smaller. Their heads are small with large jaws. Their coloration ranges from a yellowish to blackish brown, and some species have cryptic blotches.

Their fins are simple and spineless; aside from their eyes, some species also have iridescent patches covering their heads.

== Behaviour and reproduction ==
Greeneyes are generally deepwater fish, found from . They seem to prefer the continental slopes and shelves, possibly forming schools. Greeneyes are known to primarily feed on benthic invertebrates, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as decapods and mysids.

Like many aulopiform fish, greeneyes are hermaphroditic; this is thought to be a great advantage in deep-sea habitats, where the chances of running into a compatible mate are uncertain. Young and larval greeneyes are pelagic rather than benthic, staying within the upper levels of the water column. Hake are known predators of greeneyes.

== Classification ==
The genus &quot;Bathysauroides&quot; is sometimes classified with the greeneyes, but this article follows FishBase in placing it in its own family, Bathysauroididae.

<text>The State of Georgia Building (also known as 2 Peachtree Street and previously known as the First National Bank Building) is a 44-story, skyscraper located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. Built in 1966, the building was the tallest building in the Southeast at the time. It was Atlanta&#x27;s tallest until 1976, when the Westin Peachtree Plaza surpassed it. It was built on the site of the Peachtree Arcade, A. Ten Eyck Brown&#x27;s 1917 covered shopping arcade which connected Peachtree and Broad streets. 2 Peachtree Street was originally constructed as the new headquarters building for First National Bank of Atlanta, also known as First Atlanta, replacing its older (1905) headquarters building next door (the lower half of which remains today as Georgia State&#x27;s Andrew Young School of Policy Studies). It was designed by a partnership of Atlanta architectural firm FABRAP and New York firm Emery Roth &amp; Sons. First Atlanta was acquired by the holding company for Wachovia Bank in 1985, but continued to operate under its own charter until 1991. In 1991, under new liberalized banking laws, First Atlanta was merged into the charter of Wachovia Bank of Georgia. Shortly thereafter, Wachovia moved its Georgia offices to 191 Peachtree and 2 Peachtree Street was acquired by the state of Georgia for government offices.

<doc id="562737" wikidata="Q1032005" url="?curid=562737" title="HMS Ajax (22)">
<text>HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; was a &quot;Leander&quot;-class light cruiser which served with the Royal Navy during World War II. She became famous for her part in the Battle of the River Plate, the Battle of Crete, the Battle of Malta and as a supply escort in the siege of Tobruk. This ship was the eighth in the Royal Navy to bear the name. In February 1942, she was adopted by the civil community of Halifax, West Yorkshire.

==Prewar and first actions==
&quot;Ajax&quot; was built at Vickers&#x27; shipyard, in Barrow-in-Furness, England. She was laid down on 7 February 1933, launched on 1 March 1934 and completed on 12 April 1935. She was commissioned for service with the 8th Cruiser Squadron on the America and West Indies Station, but after working up in May 1935, she was deployed instead to the Mediterranean on detached service after the Abyssinian crisis. This lasted until November when she finally joined her squadron at its base at the Royal Naval Dockyard in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda. Until 1937 she undertook exercises and visits to ports in the Americas as part of the station&#x27;s &quot;South America Division&quot;. South American waters, as well as the geographic extent of the former Pacific Station, had been added to the expanse controlled from Bermuda after the First World War (as the Jamaica Station had been absorbed into the &quot;North America Station&quot; in 1830), requiring the augmentation of the 8th Cruiser Squadron (beginning with the transfer to the station of HMS &quot;Dauntless&quot; from the Mediterranean in May, 1928). Although Ajax and HMS Exeter operated from Bermuda, in the North Atlantic, they spent much of the year cruising South American waters before returning to Bermuda for maintenance and to exercise with the squadron. &quot;Ajax&quot; took part in the December, 1936 reburials at Punta Arenas of the dead of HMS Doterel (killed in the explosion of a magazine in 1881). At the end of her America and West Indies deployment, &quot;Ajax&quot; returned to Britain for refit. At this time, her 4&quot; battery was upgraded by exchanging single for double mountings.

On the 2nd and 3 June 1937, &quot;Ajax&quot; and other ships of the squadron took part in combined exercises with the Bermuda Garrison, to practice raiding a hostile shore. &quot;Blue Land Force&quot; (Headquarters, &quot;B&quot; Company, 1st. Sherwood Foresters, a company of Royal Marines, a Royal Navy howitzer battery and a naval demolition party), commanded by Major J. R. Chidlaw-Roberts, M.C, Sherwood Foresters (with its boats guided by members of the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club), was landed from &quot;Ajax&quot; before sunrise at Spanish Point, with the objective of moving overland to attack an imaginary fuel dump at Admiralty House, supported by fire from &quot;Ajax&quot;, &quot;Exeter&quot; and other vessels of the naval flotilla, as well as by naval aircraft. The defending force included patrol boats manned by the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and &quot;Red Land Force&quot; (three battalions, represented by a platoon of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps).

The Governor of Trinidad signalled the Commander-in-Chief in Bermuda on the 20th June 1937 for a cruiser to be sent to that colony due to riots that had broken out among strikers in the oil fields of Apex and Fyzabad, which had included the killings of two police officers. Workers in other industries had also staged sympathy strikes. HMS Ajax, which was at Nassau at the time, was ordered to Trinidad. &quot;Exeter&quot;, which was about to depart Bermuda for the Panama Canal, was also ordered to Trinidad on the 21st. Ajax landed platoons of seamen and marines from her crew to support the civil police in re-establishing order. On 2 July 1937, the marines of &quot;Ajax&quot; joined with those of &quot;Exeter&quot; and two-hundred police constables to assault the village of Fyzabad. By 5 July, the situation in Trinidad had returned largely to normal.

She rejoined her squadron in America and the West Indies in February 1938 and remained in the Atlantic until 1939, when she was redeployed to the Pacific, off South America. On 27 January, &quot;Ajax&quot; went to assist the rescue of earthquake victims at Talcahuano, in Chile. She then returned to Bermuda and was redeployed to the South Atlantic Division in March.

When war was declared in September 1939, &quot;Ajax&quot; took up her appropriate station and patrolled off the River Plate. There she sank the German merchant ship &quot;Olinda&quot; on 3 September. She intercepted the German merchantman &quot;Carl Fritzen&quot; and the passenger ship (with the cruiser ) on 4 and 5 September, respectively. Both ships were scuttled by their crews to avoid being taken as prizes.

After a brief deployment in and around the Falkland Islands, &quot;Ajax&quot; returned to her station off the Plate on 21 September.

== The hunt for &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; ==
When the German raider, , became a threat, Force G was formed from &quot;Ajax&quot; (flagship, Commodore Henry Harwood), and , all cruisers.(&quot;Cumberland&quot;, also part of this force, was undergoing a refit at Port Stanley). Force G located and engaged &quot;Graf Spee&quot; on 13 December, despite the German warship&#x27;s greater firepower. &quot;Ajax&quot; was hit seven times by the Germans: X and Y turrets were disabled, structural damage was sustained and there were 12 casualties including 7 killed. &quot;Exeter&quot;, more severely damaged, retired, leaving the two light cruisers to maintain contact with &quot;Graf Spee&quot; when she withdrew to Montevideo. The reasons for the German ship&#x27;s withdrawal and her failure to exploit her advantage are unclear, but there was damage to her bow, that affected her sea-worthiness, and to her fuel systems. &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot;, joined by &quot;Cumberland&quot;, awaited events and successfully bluffed the Germans into believing that a superior force was on hand. &quot;Graf Spee&quot; was scuttled by her own crew. &quot;Ajax&quot; refuelled at Port Stanley and resumed her patrol.

In January 1940, she returned to Britain for refit, via Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro and Freetown, Sierra Leone. She was joined &quot;en route&quot; by the aircraft carrier , the battlecruiser and the destroyers , , and . &quot;Ajax&quot; arrived at Plymouth at the end of January; the following month, she was handed over to Chatham Dockyard for refit.

== Mediterranean, Crete and North Africa ==
Once refitted and worked up, &quot;Ajax&quot; became ready for service in August 1940. Her refit had included the addition of a Type 279 Radar, a tripod mast and zarebas for the 4&quot; batteries.

In August 1940, &quot;Ajax&quot; was allocated to the 7th Cruiser Squadron for Mediterranean service (France had fallen and Italy was now a belligerent with a significant navy). She sailed from Britain on 21 August as part of the escort (with ), to a convoy for Egypt routed via the Mediterranean (Operation Hats), but she remained with a portion that was diverted via Durban. In late September, she escorted a troop convoy (, and ) from Aden to Suez. &quot;Ajax&quot; joined at Alexandria on 30 September.

From 2 to 16 October, &quot;Ajax&quot; was engaged in major fleet manoeuvres to interdict Italian convoys to Libya and to protect British convoys to Malta. Firstly, she sailed with the fleet to search for Italian convoys, possibly with their own fleet escorts. On 8 October, &quot;Ajax&quot; again deployed with a major naval force to cover the passage to Malta of convoy MF3 (Operation MB6). &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Orion&quot; patrolled south-east of Malta before covering the return of Convoy MF4 to Alexandria on 12 October. (The main fleet was deployed to the west of the convoy).

During the night of 11–12 October, &quot;Ajax&quot; intercepted a small Italian force. In a close-range night action (sometimes called the Battle of Cape Passero), two s, and , were sunk and the destroyer was disabled (later sunk by HMS &quot;York&quot;). Two more warships escaped into a smoke screen. &quot;Ajax&quot; herself was hit by seven shells that destroyed one of her whalers, caused severe damage to the bridge and radar installation and 35 casualties, including 13 killed. She returned to Alexandria on 16 October.

At the end of October, &quot;Ajax&quot; set out on the first of two operations to carry troop reinforcements to Suda Bay, on Crete in Operation Barbarity; she suffered near misses from air attacks. On her return to the fleet on 6 November, she helped to provide cover for a Malta convoy, MW3. This was a large operation, involving most of the Mediterranean Fleet and part of a wider set of ship movements, Operation Coat. She was part of Force X which was detached from the main fleet on 11 November to sortie into the Straits of Otranto, between Italy and Albania, to provide a diversion and give cover for the successful naval air attack on Taranto.

On 12 November, after turning to return to the main fleet, they intercepted a small convoy of four Italian merchant ships escorted by naval auxiliary and the obsolete torpedo-boat . &quot;Ramb III&quot; fired 19 salvos in its own defense and succeeded in breaking away without suffering any damage. &quot;Nicola Fabrizi&quot; stayed with the merchant ships and attacked the British forces. As a result, &quot;Nicola Fabrizi&quot; was hit immediately and suffered serious damage. The Italian torpedo boat continued to fight until it was unable to fight any more and retired badly damaged. After &quot;Nicola Fabrizi&quot; was neutralized, the British force divided up the targets and sank all four of the Italian merchant ships. This action took place near the Strait of Otranto (see Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1940)).

Force X also bombarded the port of Durazzo (now Durres) and set the oil refinery on fire. before it rejoined the fleet. &quot;Ajax&quot; and other vessels were detached from the fleet and refuelled at Suda Bay before they returned to Alexandria.

From 15 to 20 November, &quot;Ajax&quot; and four other cruisers transported troops from Alexandria to Piraeus, the port of Athens, and returned to Alexandria. On 23 November, she was deployed with Force B to cover a convoy to Crete and to support air attacks on Tripoli from &quot;Eagle&quot;.

&quot;Ajax&quot; participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan and was hit by bombs from Ju 87s on 21 May 1941. She evacuated many troops from Crete up until 29 May. She then covered Syrian operations in June and joined Force K at Malta in November, being withdrawn in February 1942 for refit.

==Two years out of action (1942 and 1943)==
On 6 February Ajax departed Suez for the United Kingdom via the Cape of Good Hope, calling at Mombasa (9 March) and Freetown (9 April), arriving in the Clyde on 14 April. On 6 June, she was taken in hand for refit at Chatham Dockyard, which lasted until September. Her anti-aircraft (AA) gunnery was augmented by eleven Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Various radar sets were also installed; fire control radars for her main guns (Type 284), AA armament (Type 285) and barrage control (Type 283); an improved aircraft warning radar (the Type 281, replaced the Type 279), surface warning radar was also fitted, (the Type 272). Her aircraft facilities were removed. &quot;Ajax&quot; underwent post refit trials in October and after being recommissioned on 24 October, she worked-up at Scapa Flow with the Home Fleet during November. On 31 December, she joined Force Q at Bône, in Algeria for the interdiction of enemy convoys and convoy defence.

&quot;Ajax&quot; was disabled by a bomb—dropped by an aircraft from II./SKG 10 or II./StG 3— hitting &quot;B&quot; boiler room on 1 January 1943 while at Bône, after convoy escort duty; she was towed on 7 January to Gibraltar for temporary repairs, which continued into February. Permanent repairs were arranged to take place in the United States and she was taken in hand at Norfolk Navy Yard, Virginia; these lasted until September. During repair work, &quot;Ajax&quot; was equipped with US quadruple 40mm anti-aircraft mountings with provision for a British fire control radar Type 282, IFF Type 242 fitted and a US fire control radar replaced her existing Type 284. After post refit trials in October, she returned to Britain, via Bermuda, in November and the fitting of British equipment was completed. &quot;Ajax&quot; was recommissioned at Portsmouth on 25 December and joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow once more for work-up before returning to the Mediterranean in February 1944 after nearly two years out of action – apart from just a couple of days in January 1943.

== D-Day and post war ==
As part of Force K, &quot;Ajax&quot; bombarded Gold Beach during the D-Day invasion; the battery at Longues gave some trouble but was silenced by 6-inch shells through the embrasures of two of the four casemates. She later supported the landings in southern France. &quot;Ajax&quot; also operated in the Aegean during the reoccupation of Athens and the communist uprising in Greece.

After the war, &quot;Ajax&quot; was used to repatriate German sailors from the crew of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; from Uruguay back to Germany – a historic irony since &quot;Ajax&quot; had been a member of the squadron that battled the German ship in 1939 and ultimately caused her to be scuttled. &quot;Ajax&quot; was then assigned to the Royal Navy Palestine Patrol and took part in the efforts to halt illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine. In July 1947 it took part in the &quot;Exodus 1947&quot; incident, in which she formed part of the Royal Navy task force which subdued the illegal immigrant ship and later escorted it back to Germany.

== Final disposition ==

&quot;Ajax&quot; was decommissioned in February 1948. Sales to the Chilean Navy or Indian Navy were mooted, but this latter deal did not materialize due to Winston Churchill&#x27;s apparent disapproval of the sale; he felt that such an important vessel would be better off broken up to preserve her history. After running aground at Newport, Monmouthshire, on 9 November 1949 while under tow to the scrapyard, she was refloated and duly arrived at Cashmore&#x27;s, in Newport, South Wales, for breaking up on 18 November 1949.

== &quot;Ajax&quot; remembered ==
The town of Ajax, in Ontario, Canada, was named after the cruiser following the Battle of the River Plate. The town also has streets named after every member of the ship&#x27;s company, such as Hobson Avenue, and Harwood Avenue, which is the town&#x27;s main north-south street. Many street signs in the town bear the silhouette of the ship. The silhouette signifies the street being named after part of the ship&#x27;s company, and the ship&#x27;s anchor rests in front of the local branch of the Royal Canadian Legion.

Calle Exeter was named in honor of the ship, after HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; and HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; provided assistance to the citizens of Concepción, following the 1939 Chillán earthquake.

&quot;Ajax&quot;″s bell is on a monument in Montevideo, just outside the port customs house, and was donated by Admiral Sir Henry Harwood and Sir Eugen Millington-Drake in 1949.

Ajax Icefall at the head of Visca Anchorage, King George Island, in the South Shetland Islands is named for HMS &quot;Ajax&quot;, which assisted in the search for a boat crew from the &quot;Discovery II&quot;, missing on King George Island in January 1937.
== In popular culture ==
The author Warren Tute&#x27;s service on HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; during the 1930s formed the background for his novel &quot;The Cruiser&quot;. Like&quot; Ajax&quot;, the novel&#x27;s fictional HMS &quot;Antigone&quot; was a &quot;Leander&quot;-class light cruiser which was based on the North America and West Indies Station before World War II and saw action in the Mediterranean. The novel paints a realistic picture of life on a cruiser.

<text>Jorge Manrique (c. 1440 – 24 April 1479) was a major Castilian poet, whose main work, the &quot;Coplas por la muerte de su padre (Verses on the death of Don Rodrigo Manrique, his Father)&quot;, is still read today. He was a supporter of the queen Isabel I of Castile, and actively participated on her side in the civil war that broke out against her half-brother, Enrique IV, when the latter attempted to make his daughter, Juana, crown princess. Jorge died in 1479 during an attempt to take the castle of Garcimuñoz, defended by the Marquis of Villena (a staunch enemy of Isabel), after Isabel gained the crown.

Manrique was a great-nephew of Iñigo López de Mendoza (marquis of Santillana), a descendant of Pero López de Ayala, chancellor of Castile, and a nephew of Gómez Manrique, &quot;corregidor&quot; of Toledo, all important poets of the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. He was, therefore, a member of a noble family of great literary consequence. The topic of his work was the &quot;tempus fugit&quot;.

==The Minor Lyrics==
Jorge Manrique wrote love lyrics in the courtly-love tradition and two satires. These called &quot;canciones&quot; (songs), &quot;esparsas&quot; (short poems, generally of a single stanza), &quot;preguntas y respuestas&quot; (questions and answers), and &quot;glosas de mote&quot; (literally, &quot;interpretations of refrains&quot;; see villancico). The first edition of the &quot;Cancionero general&quot; of Hernando del Castillo (1511) has the most complete selection of Manrique&#x27;s poems, but some of the lyrics appear in other early editions and manuscripts.

==Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre ==

&quot;Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre&quot; (English: &quot;Stanzas about the Death of his Father&quot;) is Jorge Manrique&#x27;s best composition. In fact, Lope de Vega pronounced it in humbled admiration to its superior craftmanship, &quot;worthy to be printed in letters of gold&quot;. It is a funeral eulogy dedicated to the memory of Rodrigo Manrique (his father), who died on 11 November 1476 in Ocaña. Jorge thought that his father led a life worth living. He makes a reference to three lives:
* the terrestrial life that ends in death
* the life of the fame, that lasts longer (Kleos Greek)
* the eternal life after death, that has no end.

Stanzas 1-24 talk about an excessive devotion to earthly life from a general point of view, but features some of the most memorable metaphors in the poem. Among other things, life is compared to a road filled with dangers and opportunities and to a river that ends in the sea:

I&lt;br&gt; 

&quot;Recuerde el alma dormida&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;avive el seso e despierte&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;contemplando&quot; &lt;br&gt; 
&quot;cómo se pasa la vida,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;cómo se viene la muerte&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;tan callando;&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;cuán presto se va el placer,&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;cómo, después de acordado,&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;da dolor;&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;cómo, a nuestro parecer,&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;cualquiera tiempo pasado&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;fue mejor.&quot; 

O let the soul her slumbers break, &lt;br&gt;
Let thought be quickened, and awake; &lt;br&gt;
Awake to see &lt;br&gt;
How soon this life is past and gone, &lt;br&gt;
And death comes softly stealing on, &lt;br&gt;
How silently! &lt;br&gt;
Swiftly our pleasures glide away, &lt;br&gt;
Our hearts recall the distant day &lt;br&gt;
the pain &lt;br&gt;
The moments that are speeding fast &lt;br&gt;
We heed not, but the past,—the past, &lt;br&gt;
More highly prize.

III&lt;br&gt;

&quot;Nuestras vidas son los ríos&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;que van a dar en la mar,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;que es el morir.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Allí van los señoríos&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;derechos a se acabar&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;e consumir.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;allí los ríos caudales,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;allí los otros medianos&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;e más chicos,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;allegados, son iguales&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;los que viven por sus manos&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;e los ricos.&quot;

Our lives are rivers, gliding free&lt;br&gt;
To that unfathomed, boundless sea,&lt;br&gt;
The silent grave!&lt;br&gt;
Thither all earthly pomp and boast&lt;br&gt;
Roll, to be swallowed up and lost&lt;br&gt;
In one dark wave. &lt;br&gt;
Thither the mighty torrents stray,&lt;br&gt;
Thither the brook pursues its way,&lt;br&gt;
And tinkling rill,&lt;br&gt;
There all are equal; side by side&lt;br&gt;
The poor man and the son of pride&lt;br&gt;
Lie calm and still.

The section invokes general examples of human waywardness that one may encounter along the road leading to heaven or hell, but then gives some examples of infamous deaths drawn from contemporary Spanish history. These examples are introduced by the rhetorical questions called &quot;ubi sunt&quot; (Where are they?) in stanzas 15-24:&lt;br&gt;
XVI&lt;br&gt;

&quot;¿Qué se hizo el rey don Joan?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Los infantes d&#x27;Aragón&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;¿qué se hizieron?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;¿Qué fue de tanto galán,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;qué de tanta invinción&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;como truxeron?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;¿Que fueron sino devaneos,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;qué fueron sino verduras&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;de las eras,&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;las justas e los torneos,&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;paramentos, bordaduras&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;e çimeras?&quot;

Where is the King, Don Juan? Where&lt;br&gt;
Each royal prince and noble heir&lt;br&gt;
of Aragon?&lt;br&gt;
Where are the courtly gallantries?&lt;br&gt;
The deeds of love and high emprise, &lt;br&gt; 
In battle done? &lt;br&gt;
Tourney and joust, that charmed the eye, &lt;br&gt;
And scarf, and gorgeous panoply,&lt;br&gt;
And nodding plume,&lt;br&gt;
What were they but a pageant scene?&lt;br&gt;
What but the garlands, gay and green,&lt;br&gt;
That deck the tomb?

The last part of the poem is devoted to his father and talks about the life of fame and the possibility of continuing to live in the memories of the living, when one is great and has accomplished great deeds while living (stanzas 25-32). The poem ends with a small dramatic dialogue in which don Rodrigo confronts a personified Death, who deferentially takes his soul to Heaven (stanzas 33-39). A final stanza (40) gives consolation to the family.

The language Manrique uses is precise, exact, without decoration or difficult metaphors. It appears to focus on the content of what is said and not on how it is said. The poem has forty stanzas, each composed of twelve eight- and four-syllable lines that rhyme ABc ABc DEf DEf. Every third line is a &quot;quebrado&quot; (half line). The verse form is now known as the &quot;copla manriqueña&quot; (Manriquean stanza), because his poem was so widely read and glossed that he popularized the meter. Its alternation of long and short lines, and their punctuation, made the verses flexible enough to sound somber or light and quick.

&quot;Coplas por la muerte de su padre&quot; has been translated at least twice, once by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The translations of stanzas I, III, and XVI provided above are by Longfellow. However, the Longfellow translation has been criticized as not being faithful to the original. Longfellow&#x27;s translation is considerably more florid than the original. For example, the famous lines &quot;Nuestras vidas son los ríos/ que van a dar en la mar,/ que es el morir,&quot; which reads in Longfellow as &quot;Our lives are rivers, gliding free/ To that unfathomed, boundless sea,/ The silent grave!&quot; literally translates as &quot;Our lives are rivers/ That will lead to the sea/ Which is death.&quot;

<text>Canada Square is a square at Canary Wharf in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, located in London. Canada Square is surrounded by three of the tallest buildings in the United Kingdom, including One Canada Square, which was the tallest building in the United Kingdom from 1990 until late 2010, when it was surpassed by The Shard in the London Borough of Southwark.

The complex is named for Canada by Olympia and York, the original developers of the site owned by the Reichmann family of Toronto.

The complex and the square is served by Canary Wharf Underground station on the Jubilee line and Canary Wharf DLR station on the Docklands Light Railway.

<text>Ataman (variants: &quot;otaman&quot;, &quot;wataman&quot;, &quot;vataman&quot;; ; ) was a title of Cossack and haidamak leaders of various kinds. In the Russian Empire, the term was the official title of the supreme military commanders of the Cossack armies. The Ukrainian version of the same word is &quot;hetman&quot;. &quot;Otaman&quot; in Ukrainian Cossack forces was a position of a lower rank.

==Etymology==
The etymologies of the words &quot;ataman&quot; and &quot;hetman&quot; are disputed. There may be several independent Germanic and Turkic origins for seemingly cognate forms of the words, all referring to the same concept. The &quot;hetman&quot; form cognates with German &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (&#x27;captain&#x27;, literally &#x27;head-man&#x27;) by the way of Czech or Polish, like several other titles. The Russian term &quot;ataman&quot; is probably connected to Old East Slavic &quot;vatamanŭ,&quot; and cognates with Turkic &quot;odoman&quot; (Ottoman Turks). The term &quot;ataman&quot; may had also a lingual interaction with Polish &quot;hetman&quot; and German &quot;hauptmann&quot;.

Suggestions have been made that the word might be of Turkic origin, literally meaning &#x27;father of horsemen&#x27; or &#x27;father of men&#x27;, &#x27;pure blooded father&#x27; or &#x27;eldest man&#x27;. Considering the &#x27;-man&#x27; suffix in turkic languages means men, person, pure blooded or most. Dictionaries assert that the word comes from the German word &#x27;&quot;Hauptmann&#x27;&quot; which means &#x27;head man&#x27;, &#x27;headman&#x27; or &#x27;chieftain&#x27; which entered the Russian language through Polish &quot;&#x27;hetman&quot;&#x27;. 

==Otaman in Ukraine==
&quot;Otamans&quot; were usually elected by the Host Council or could have been appointed, especially during the military campaigns. The appointed otamans were called acting otaman (, ).

In the Cossack Hetmanate, leaders of non-Cossack military units (artillery, etc.) were also called &quot;otamans&quot;. In the Cossack Hetmanate, the title was used for the administrative purposes, such as the head of the city, City Otaman (городовий отаман). Later such administrative uses were adopted by the Kuban Cossacks and were common in Kuban Oblast with different variations.

There were various types of otaman:
*Army otaman (), an executive officer in the Zaporizhian Host
*Campaign otaman ()
*Kish otaman ()
*Kurin otaman (), a commander of a ;
*&quot;Sotennyi otoman&quot; () and city otaman () were the &#x27;s lieutenants. Those titles were introduced during the Hetmanate in the 17th century. Together with the (, &#x27;aide-de-camp&#x27;) and (, &#x27;flag-bearer&#x27;), this otoman helped the in administrative affairs.
*Village otoman (), an administrative rank in the 17th to 18th centuries
*Okruh otaman (), a territorial leader
*Stanytsia otaman (), a territorial leader
*Khutir otaman (), a territorial leader

Otamans were also in charge of general- and regimental-size artillery units, as well as any volunteer military formations and the Zholdak cavalry.

== 20th century to present ==
&quot;Atamans&quot; were the titles of supreme leaders of various Cossack armies during the Russian Civil War.

When Ukraine acquired its independence in 1918, the rank took on different value. Among the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen and the Ukrainian Galician Army, it was equivalent to a major, as is the battalion executive officer today. In the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, the title was of a general rank. &quot;Chief Otoman&quot; (головний отаман) was the general of the Ukrainian Army who was assisted by his deputies, Acting Otomans.

The head of the army of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, in particular, Symon Petliura, was called &quot;Supreme Otaman&quot; (головний отаман).

Russian-Azerbaijani MMA fighter Rafael Fiziev fights with the nickname &quot;Ataman&quot; as a homage to his mixed Central Asian heritage.

<text>Ubertino of Casale (1259 – c. 1329) was an Italian Franciscan and one of the leaders (together with Michael of Cesena) of the Spirituals, the stricter branch of the Franciscan order.

==Life==
Ubertino was born in Casale Monferrato. He assumed the Franciscan habit in a convent of the province of Genoa in 1273, and was sent to Paris to continue his studies, where he remained for nine years, after which he returned to Italy. In 1285 he visited the sanctuaries of Rome, and thence proceeded to Greccio, near Rieti, to see John of Parma, who was considered as the patriarch of the Spiritual Friars. Afterwards, he settled in Tuscany and in 1287, at Florence, where he came under the influence of Pierre-Jean Olivi. He held a lectorship at Santa Croce, Florence, but abandoned it after a few years to dedicate himself to preaching, especially at Florence. Being a man of genius, but of an eccentric and restless character, he soon became the leader of the Spirituals in Tuscany.

The Spirituals espoused poverty as obligatory and insisted on a stricter interpretation of the Rule of Saint Francis. They publicly criticized the government of the order and Popes Gregory IX and Nicholas III, who had favoured a moderate interpretation of the rule, and Pope Innocent III, who had disapproved of the teaching of Joachim of Fiore, as heretics. Therefore, Ubertino was summoned before Pope Benedict XI, forbidden to preach at Perugia, and banished to the convent of Monte Alverna. During his banishment, Ubertino wrote the &quot;Arbor Vitae Crucifixae Jesu Christi&quot; (&quot;The Tree of the Crucified Life of Jesus&quot;), exalting a literal interpretation of the Rule of St. Francis and the poverty of Christ. He mentions having met the mystic Angela of Foligno, who helped him resolve some unspecified inner difficulties.

In the book, Ubertino identified Pope Boniface VIII, another opponent of the Spirituals, and Benedict XI as the first and second beasts of the Apocalypse. The text circulated widely amongst the Canons Regular of the Windesheim Congregation, and was an important influence on John of Schoonhoven&#x27;s &quot;De passione Domini&quot;.

Ubertino had many protectors and admirers. In 1307, he was chosen chaplain and familiar to Cardinal Napoleone Orsini Frangipani, cardinal-protector of the Spirituals of the Marches of Ancona, but which protectorate soon ceased by the election of Boniface VIII in December 1294. In 1308, when Orsini went to Germany, Ubertino moved to France.

In 1312-13, he was called to Avignon with other chiefs of the Spirituals to discuss before the pope the questions at issue between the two parties in the order. During discussions, he attacked the moderate majority of his order and demanded separate convents and provinces for his party. But this was absolutely denied, whilst on the other hand the question of the practical observance of poverty was settled by the famous Bull &quot;Exivi de paradiso&quot;, 6 May 1312, partly called forth by the polemical writings of Ubertino.

Ubertino stayed with Cardinal Giacomo Colonna until 1317, when Pope John XXII allowed him to leave the Franciscan order and enter the Benedictine Abbey of Gembloux, in the Diocese of Liège. Since Ubertino did not stop involving himself in the conflicts among Franciscans, he was excommunicated in 1318. In 1322, Ubertino was called back to Avignon by the Pope to give his opinion on a controversy between Dominicans and Franciscans concerning the poverty of Jesus Christ and the Apostles. Ubertino asserted that Christ and the Apostles, though they had rejected all property of private persons, made use of goods and money for necessities and alms as ministers of religion. This response was well received by Pope John XXII.

Ubertino remained in Avignon, in the service of Cardinal Orsini, until 1325, when he was accused of heresy for having defended the condemned opinions of his teacher Peter Olivi. While the Pope commanded the general of the Franciscans to have him arrested as a heretic, Ubertino probably went to Germany to seek the protection of Louis the Bavarian, whom he is said to have accompanied on his way to Rome in 1328.

Afterwards, Ubertino disappeared from the historical record. Some suppose that he left the Benedictines in 1332 to join the Carthusians, while the 15th century Fraticelli venerated him as a saint and a martyr. Dante mentioned him in his &quot;Comedy&quot;, as a supporter of stricter Franciscan rules.

== References in popular culture ==

Ubertino appears as a minor, yet important character in Umberto Eco&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1980), and its film adaptation, where Ubertino is played by William Hickey.

<text>In graph theory, a vertex cover (sometimes node cover) of a graph is a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of every edge of the graph. 

In computer science, the problem of finding a minimum vertex cover is a classical optimization problem. It is NP-hard, so it cannot be solved by a polynomial-time algorithm if P ≠ NP. Moreover, it is hard to approximate – it cannot be approximated up to a factor smaller than 2 if the unique games conjecture is true. On the other hand, it has several simple 2-factor approximations. It is a typical example of an NP-hard optimization problem that has an approximation algorithm. Its decision version, the vertex cover problem, was one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems and is therefore a classical NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory. Furthermore, the vertex cover problem is fixed-parameter tractable and a central problem in parameterized complexity theory.

The minimum vertex cover problem can be formulated as a half-integral, linear program whose dual linear program is the maximum matching problem.

Vertex cover problems have been generalized to hypergraphs, see &quot;Vertex cover in hypergraphs&quot;.

== Definition ==

Formally, a vertex cover formula_1 of an undirected graph formula_2 is a subset of formula_3 such that formula_4, that is to say it is a set of vertices formula_1 where every edge has at least one endpoint in the vertex cover formula_1. Such a set is said to &quot;cover&quot; the edges of formula_7. The upper figure shows two examples of vertex covers, with some vertex cover formula_1 marked in red.

A &quot;minimum vertex cover&quot; is a vertex cover of smallest possible size. The vertex cover number formula_9 is the size of a minimum vertex cover, i.e. formula_10. The lower figure shows examples of minimum vertex covers in the previous graphs.

=== Examples ===

* The set of all vertices is a vertex cover.
* The endpoints of any maximal matching form a vertex cover.
* The complete bipartite graph formula_11 has a minimum vertex cover of size formula_12.

=== Properties ===

* A set of vertices is a vertex cover if and only if its complement is an independent set.
* Consequently, the number of vertices of a graph is equal to its minimum vertex cover number plus the size of a maximum independent set.

==Computational problem==

The minimum vertex cover problem is the optimization problem of finding a smallest vertex cover in a given graph.
:INSTANCE: Graph formula_7
:OUTPUT: Smallest number formula_14 such that formula_7 has a vertex cover of size formula_14.
If the problem is stated as a decision problem, it is called the vertex cover problem:
:INSTANCE: Graph formula_7 and positive integer formula_14.
:QUESTION: Does formula_7 have a vertex cover of size at most formula_14?

The vertex cover problem is an NP-complete problem: it was one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems. It is often used in computational complexity theory as a starting point for NP-hardness proofs.

===ILP formulation===
Assume that every vertex has an associated cost of formula_21.
The (weighted) minimum vertex cover problem can be formulated as the following integer linear program (ILP).
This ILP belongs to the more general class of ILPs for covering problems.
The integrality gap of this ILP is formula_22, so its relaxation (allowing each variable to be in the interval from 0 to 1, rather than requiring the variables to be only 0 or 1) gives a factor-formula_22 approximation algorithm for the minimum vertex cover problem.
Furthermore, the linear programming relaxation of that ILP is &quot;half-integral&quot;, that is, there exists an optimal solution for which each entry formula_24 is either 0, 1/2, or 1. A 2-approximate vertex cover can be obtained from this fractional solution by selecting the subset of vertices whose variables are nonzero.

=== Exact evaluation ===

The decision variant of the vertex cover problem is NP-complete, which means it is unlikely that there is an efficient algorithm to solve it exactly for arbitrary graphs. NP-completeness can be proven by reduction from 3-satisfiability or, as Karp did, by reduction from the clique problem. Vertex cover remains NP-complete even in cubic graphs and even in planar graphs of degree at most 3.

For bipartite graphs, the equivalence between vertex cover and maximum matching described by Kőnig&#x27;s theorem allows the bipartite vertex cover problem to be solved in polynomial time.

For tree graphs, an algorithm finds a minimal vertex cover in polynomial time by finding the first leaf in the tree and adding its parent to the minimal vertex cover, then deleting the leaf and parent and all associated edges and continuing repeatedly until no edges remain in the tree.

==== Fixed-parameter tractability ====

An exhaustive search algorithm can solve the problem in time 2&quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;O&quot;(1), where &quot;k&quot; is the size of the vertex cover. Vertex cover is therefore fixed-parameter tractable, and if we are only interested in small &quot;k&quot;, we can solve the problem in polynomial time. One algorithmic technique that works here is called &quot;bounded search tree algorithm&quot;, and its idea is to repeatedly choose some vertex and recursively branch, with two cases at each step: place either the current vertex or all its neighbours into the vertex cover.
The algorithm for solving vertex cover that achieves the best asymptotic dependence on the parameter runs in time formula_25. The klam value of this time bound (an estimate for the largest parameter value that could be solved in a reasonable amount of time) is approximately 190. That is, unless additional algorithmic improvements can be found, this algorithm is suitable only for instances whose vertex cover number is 190 or less. Under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions, namely the exponential time hypothesis, the running time cannot be improved to 2&quot;o&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), even when formula_26 is formula_27.

However, for planar graphs, and more generally, for graphs excluding some fixed graph as a minor, a vertex cover of size &quot;k&quot; can be found in time &quot;formula_28&quot;, i.e., the problem is subexponential fixed-parameter tractable. This algorithm is again optimal, in the sense that, under the exponential time hypothesis, no algorithm can solve vertex cover on planar graphs in time &quot;formula_29&quot;.

=== Approximate evaluation ===

One can find a factor-2 approximation by repeatedly taking &quot;both&quot; endpoints of an edge into the vertex cover, then removing them from the graph. Put otherwise, we find a maximal matching &quot;M&quot; with a greedy algorithm and construct a vertex cover &quot;C&quot; that consists of all endpoints of the edges in &quot;M&quot;. In the following figure, a maximal matching &quot;M&quot; is marked with red, and the vertex cover &quot;C&quot; is marked with blue.

The set &quot;C&quot; constructed this way is a vertex cover: suppose that an edge &quot;e&quot; is not covered by &quot;C&quot;; then &quot;M&quot; ∪ {&quot;e&quot;} is a matching and &quot;e&quot; ∉ &quot;M&quot;, which is a contradiction with the assumption that &quot;M&quot; is maximal. Furthermore, if &quot;e&quot; = {&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;} ∈ &quot;M&quot;, then any vertex cover – including an optimal vertex cover – must contain &quot;u&quot; or &quot;v&quot; (or both); otherwise the edge &quot;e&quot; is not covered. That is, an optimal cover contains at least &quot;one&quot; endpoint of each edge in &quot;M&quot;; in total, the set &quot;C&quot; is at most 2 times as large as the optimal vertex cover.

This simple algorithm was discovered independently by Fanica Gavril and Mihalis Yannakakis.

More involved techniques show that there are approximation algorithms with a slightly better approximation factor. For example, an approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of formula_30 is known. The problem can be approximated with an approximation factor formula_31 in formula_32 - dense graphs.

==== Inapproximability ====
No better constant-factor approximation algorithm than the above one is known.
The minimum vertex cover problem is APX-complete, that is, it cannot be approximated arbitrarily well unless P = NP.
Using techniques from the PCP theorem, Dinur and Safra proved in 2005 that minimum vertex cover cannot be approximated within a factor of 1.3606 for any sufficiently large vertex degree unless P = NP. 
Later, the factor was improved to formula_33 for any formula_34.
Moreover, if the unique games conjecture is true then minimum vertex cover cannot be approximated within any constant factor better than 2.

Although finding the minimum-size vertex cover is equivalent to finding the maximum-size independent set, as described above, the two problems are not equivalent in an approximation-preserving way: The Independent Set problem has &quot;no&quot; constant-factor approximation unless P = NP.

====Pseudocode====
Approximation algorithm:
APPROXIMATION-VERTEX-COVER(G)
C = ∅
E&#x27;= G.E

while E&#x27; ≠ ∅:
 let (u, v) be an arbitrary edge of E&#x27;
 C = C ∪ {u, v}
 remove from E&#x27; every edge incident on either u or v

return C
== Applications ==
Vertex cover optimization serves as a model for many real-world and theoretical problems. For example, a commercial establishment interested in installing the fewest possible closed circuit cameras covering all hallways (edges) connecting all rooms (nodes) on a floor might model the objective as a vertex cover minimization problem. The problem has also been used to model the elimination of repetitive DNA sequences for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications.

<text>Alejandro Eloy Carrasquel Aparicio (July 24, 1912 – August 19, 1969) was a Venezuelan pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Washington Senators and the Chicago White Sox over a span of eight seasons from 1939 to 1949. Nicknamed &quot;Patón&quot; (&quot;Bigfoot&quot;) in Venezuela, he was listed at 6&#x27; 1&quot; (1.85 mt), 182 lb. (82 kg), and batted and threw right handed.

Carrasquel became the first Venezuelan-born player to ever appear in the majors when he joined the Senators in its 1939 season. He is also known as one of the handful of major leaguers who jumped from their organized baseball teams to play in the Mexican League in .

==Baseball career==
Born in Caracas, Carrasquel had a fine fastball, which he complemented with an effective knuckleball and a decent curve. He started his major league career with the Senators of the American League on April 23, 1939. Carrasquel became the second player to go straight into the major leagues, following Ted Lyons, who did it in 1923.

Carrasquel made his first appearance against the New York Yankees at Griffith Stadium. He relieved starter Ken Chase with two outs in the fourth inning and a runner on first base. The first three batters Carrasquel faced were future Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig and Bill Dickey. He retired them all, striking out DiMaggio while retiring Gehrig on a ground ball and Dickey on a pop fly. Carrasquel threw solid innings of relief, surrendering only one run over that span, though the Yankees won, 7–4.

In his second game, on April 30, Carrasquel earned his first save at Yankee Stadium. He was called in to relieve in the eighth inning, with two outs and the bases loaded, and Washington trying to preserve a 3–2 lead. Carrasquel got the third out by retiring Yankees second baseman Joe Gordon, then retired Red Ruffing, Frankie Crosetti and Red Rolfe in order in the ninth to preserve the Senators victory.

A month later, on May 30, Carrasquel hit his only career home run, a solo blast off pitcher Nels Potter in a 3–1 loss to the Philadelphia Athletics, which was the first home run hit by a Venezuelan player in a major league game.

In the 1940s, Carrasquel posted positive win–loss records in six consecutive seasons for lousy Senators teams that usually finished below .500. He had a 6–2 record (.750) in both 1940 and 1941, while the Senators went 64-90 and 70–84, respectively. In 1942 he went 7–7 (.500); Washington, 60–91.

His most productive season came in 1943, when he had a 11–7 record and 3.43 ERA in 39 games (13 starts), including four complete games, one shutout and five saves. His shutout was also a career highlight on April 25, as he pitched a two-hitter, 5–0 victory against the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. The Senators actually finished over .500 at 84–69.

Three days later, on May 3, Carrasquel made his third relief appearance and picked up his first win as well as the first by a Venezuelan pitcher in Major League Baseball history when the Senators defeated the St. Louis Browns at Sportsman’s Park. Washington rallied from a six-run deficit in the sixth, scoring seven runs over the final three innings of the game, en route to an 11–10 road victory. Carrasquel pitched scoreless eighth and ninth innings to secure the historic win.

Carrasquel made his first big league start on May 14 against the visiting Boston Red Sox at Griffith Stadium. Carrasquel engaged in an 11-inning pitching duel with Lefty Grove and the score tied at 2–2, until the Red Sox chased him with three runs in the top of the 12th, while the Senators’ rally in the bottom of the inning against Grove and two relievers fell one run short, as the Sox prevailed, 5–4. Besides, in the 7th inning Carrasquel recorded the first hit by a Venezuelan player in the major leagues when he singled off Grove. Incidentally, Carrasquel faced a Red Sox starting lineup that had other future Hall of Famers: Joe Cronin, Bobby Doerr, Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams, and the aforementioned Grove. On August 13, he won a rematch with the Red Sox at Fenway Park, earning his sixth win of the season in a 6–3, complete game effort.

Although World War II was officially over and baseball&#x27;s finest players were back in their familiar ranks, tranquility no longer had a place in the majors. The new Mexican League, headed by millionaire Jorge Pasquel, had lured a cluster of big leaguers. On January 2, 1946, the Chicago White Sox bought Carrasquel&#x27;s contract from the Senators. He rejected the deal and fled to play in Mexico, signing a three-year contract – the first shot in the cross-border disputes that would dominate baseball even more than the return of the war veterans. “Pasquel paid me $3,000 cash [bonus], to sign a three-year contract calling for $10,000 a year,” Carrasquel said, in an interview three years later. “I took it, for in addition to the $33,000 I was to receive in Mexico, I also was free to pitch winter baseball”, he added, according to historian Lou Hernandez. There were several other players who fled to Mexico, including outfielder Danny Gardella, pitchers Sal Maglie and Max Lanier and catcher Mickey Owen. As a result, Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler sought a lifetime suspension for them, but his penalty was later reduced.

In 1949, Carrasquel returned to the majors and made three appearances for the White Sox before being farmed out. When Chicago acquired his nephew Chico Carrasquel in that season, GM Frank Lane swapped Alex to the Detroit Tigers for Cuban reliever Witto Aloma, who acted strictly as an interpreter for the young Venezuelan shortstop.

==Career statistics==
In an eight-season major league career, Carrasquel posted a 50–39 record with 252 strikeouts, a 3.73 ERA, 30 complete games, four shutouts, 16 saves, and 861 innings pitched in 258 games (64 as a starter).

Carrasquel was married to Virginia Johnson. They had two sons, Thomas and William. He died in Caracas, Venezuela, at the age of 57 in 1969. In his native country, Carrasquel was affectionately nicknamed &#x27;Patón&#x27; (Bigfoot) due to his shoe size 14.

<doc id="562788" wikidata="Q623293" url="?curid=562788" title="Basal metabolic rate">
<text>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the rate of energy expenditure per unit time by endothermic animals at rest. It is reported in energy units per unit time ranging from watt (joule/second) to ml O2/min or joule per hour per kg body mass J/(h·kg). Proper measurement requires a strict set of criteria to be met. These criteria include being in a physically and psychologically undisturbed state and being in a thermally neutral environment while in the post-absorptive state (i.e., not actively digesting food). In bradymetabolic animals, such as fish and reptiles, the equivalent term standard metabolic rate (SMR) applies. It follows the same criteria as BMR, but requires the documentation of the temperature at which the metabolic rate was measured. This makes BMR a variant of standard metabolic rate measurement that excludes the temperature data, a practice that has led to problems in defining &quot;standard&quot; rates of metabolism for many mammals.

Metabolism comprises the processes that the body needs to function. Basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy per unit of time that a person needs to keep the body functioning at rest. Some of those processes are breathing, blood circulation, controlling body temperature, cell growth, brain and nerve function, and contraction of muscles. Basal metabolic rate affects the rate that a person burns calories and ultimately whether that individual maintains, gains, or loses weight. The basal metabolic rate accounts for about 70% of the daily calorie expenditure by individuals. It is influenced by several factors. In humans, BMR typically declines by 1–2% per decade after age 20, mostly due to loss of fat-free mass, although the variability between individuals is high.

==Description==
The body&#x27;s generation of heat is known as thermogenesis and it can be measured to determine the amount of energy expended. BMR generally decreases with age, and with the decrease in lean body mass (as may happen with aging). Increasing muscle mass has the effect of increasing BMR. Aerobic (resistance) fitness level, a product of cardiovascular exercise, while previously thought to have effect on BMR, has been shown in the 1990s not to correlate with BMR when adjusted for fat-free body mass. But anaerobic exercise does increase resting energy consumption (see &quot;aerobic vs. anaerobic exercise&quot;). Illness, previously consumed food and beverages, environmental temperature, and stress levels can affect one&#x27;s overall energy expenditure as well as one&#x27;s BMR.

BMR is measured under very restrictive circumstances when a person is awake. An accurate BMR measurement requires that the person&#x27;s sympathetic nervous system not be stimulated, a condition which requires complete rest. A more common measurement, which uses less strict criteria, is resting metabolic rate (RMR).

BMR may be measured by gas analysis through either direct or indirect calorimetry, though a rough estimation can be acquired through an equation using age, sex, height, and weight. Studies of energy metabolism using both methods provide convincing evidence for the validity of the respiratory quotient (RQ), which measures the inherent composition and utilization of carbohydrates, fats and proteins as they are converted to energy substrate units that can be used by the body as energy.

==Phenotypic flexibility==
BMR is a flexible trait (it can be reversibly adjusted within individuals), with, for example, lower temperatures generally resulting in higher basal metabolic rates for both birds and rodents. There are two models to explain how BMR changes in response to temperature: the variable maximum model (VMM) and variable fraction model (VFM). The VMM states that the summit metabolism (or the maximum metabolic rate in response to the cold) increases during the winter, and that the sustained metabolism (or the metabolic rate that can be indefinitely sustained) remains a constant fraction of the former. The VFM says that the summit metabolism does not change, but that the sustained metabolism is a larger fraction of it. The VMM is supported in mammals, and, when using whole-body rates, passerine birds. The VFM is supported in studies of passerine birds using mass-specific metabolic rates (or metabolic rates per unit of mass). This latter measurement has been criticized by Eric Liknes, Sarah Scott, and David Swanson, who say that mass-specific metabolic rates are inconsistent seasonally.

In addition to adjusting to temperature, BMR also may adjust before annual migration cycles. The red knot (ssp. &quot;islandica&quot;) increases its BMR by about 40% before migrating northward. This is because of the energetic demand of long-distance flights. The increase is likely primarily due to increased mass in organs related to flight. The end destination of migrants affects their BMR: yellow-rumped warblers migrating northward were found to have a 31% higher BMR than those migrating southward.

In humans, BMR is directly proportional to a person&#x27;s lean body mass. In other words, the more lean body mass a person has, the higher their BMR; but BMR is also affected by acute illnesses and increases with conditions like burns, fractures, infections, fevers, etc. In menstruating females, BMR varies to some extent with the phases of their menstrual cycle. Due to the increase in progesterone, BMR rises at the start of the luteal phase and stays at its highest until this phase ends. There are different findings in research how much of an increase usually occurs. Small sample, early studies, found various figures, such as; a 6% higher postovulatory sleep metabolism, a 7% to 15% higher 24 hour expenditure following ovulation, and an increase and a luteal phase BMR increase by up to 12%. A study by the American Society of Clinical Nutrition found that an experimental group of female volunteers had an 11.5% average increase in 24 hour energy expenditure in the two weeks following ovulation, with a range of 8% to 16%. This group was measured via simultaneously direct and indirect calorimetry and had standardized daily meals and sedentary schedule in order to prevent the increase from being manipulated by change in food intake or activity level. A 2011 study conducted by the Mandya Institute of Medical Sciences found that during a woman&#x27;s follicular phase and menstrual cycle is no significant difference in BMR, however the calories burned per hour is significantly higher, up to 18%, during the luteal phase. Increased state anxiety (stress level) also temporarily increased BMR.

==Physiology==
The early work of the scientists J. Arthur Harris and Francis G. Benedict showed that approximate values for BMR could be derived using body surface area (computed from height and weight), age, and sex, along with the oxygen and carbon dioxide measures taken from calorimetry. Studies also showed that by eliminating the sex differences that occur with the accumulation of adipose tissue by expressing metabolic rate per unit of &quot;fat-free&quot; or lean body mass, the values between sexes for basal metabolism are essentially the same. Exercise physiology textbooks have tables to show the conversion of height and body surface area as they relate to weight and basal metabolic values.

The primary organ responsible for regulating metabolism is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is located on the diencephalon and forms the floor and part of the lateral walls of the third ventricle of the cerebrum. The chief functions of the hypothalamus are:
# control and integration of activities of the autonomic nervous system (ANS)
#* The ANS regulates contraction of smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, along with secretions of many endocrine organs such as the thyroid gland (associated with many metabolic disorders).
#* Through the ANS, the hypothalamus is the main regulator of visceral activities, such as heart rate, movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract, and contraction of the urinary bladder.
# production and regulation of feelings of rage and aggression
# regulation of body temperature
# regulation of food intake, through two centers:
#* The feeding center or hunger center is responsible for the sensations that cause us to seek food. When sufficient food or substrates have been received and leptin is high, then the satiety center is stimulated and sends impulses that inhibit the feeding center. When insufficient food is present in the stomach and ghrelin levels are high, receptors in the hypothalamus initiate the sense of hunger.
#* The thirst center operates similarly when certain cells in the hypothalamus are stimulated by the rising osmotic pressure of the extracellular fluid. If thirst is satisfied, osmotic pressure decreases.

All of these functions taken together form a survival mechanism that causes us to sustain the body processes that BMR measures.

===BMR estimation formulas===
Several equations to predict the number of calories required by humans have been published from the early 20th–21st centuries. In each of the formulas below:
: P is total heat production at complete rest,
: m is mass (kg),
: h is height (cm),
: a is age (years).

;The original Harris–Benedict equation
Historically, the most notable formula was the Harris–Benedict equation, which was published in 1919:
: for men, formula_1
: for women, formula_2

The difference in BMR for men and women is mainly due to differences in body mass. For example, a 55-year-old woman weighing and tall would have a BMR of per day.

;The revised Harris–Benedict equation
In 1984, the original Harris–Benedict equations were revised using new data. In comparisons with actual expenditure, the revised equations were found to be more accurate:
: for men, formula_3
: for women, formula_4
It was the best prediction equation until 1990, when Mifflin &quot;et al.&quot; introduced the equation:

;The Mifflin St Jeor equation
: formula_5
where &quot;s&quot; is +5 for males and −161 for females.

According to this formula, the woman in the example above has a BMR of per day.
During the last 100 years, lifestyles have changed, and Frankenfield &quot;et al.&quot; showed it to be about 5% more accurate.

These formulas are based on body mass, which does not take into account the difference in metabolic activity between lean body mass and body fat. Other formulas exist which take into account lean body mass, two of which are the Katch–McArdle formula and Cunningham formula.

;The Katch–McArdle formula (resting daily energy expenditure)
The Katch–McArdle formula is used to predict resting daily energy expenditure (RDEE).
The Cunningham formula is commonly cited to predict RMR instead of BMR; however, the formulas provided by Katch–McArdle and Cunningham are the same.
: formula_6
where ℓ is the lean body mass (&quot;LBM&quot; in kg):
: formula_7
where f is the body fat percentage.

According to this formula, if the woman in the example has a body fat percentage of 30%, her resting daily energy expenditure (the authors use the term of basal and resting metabolism interchangeably) would be 1262 kcal per day.

===Research on individual differences in BMR===
The basic metabolic rate varies between individuals. One study of 150 adults representative of the population in Scotland reported basal metabolic rates from as low as per day to as high as , with a mean BMR of per day. Statistically, the researchers calculated that 62% of this variation was explained by differences in fat free mass. Other factors explaining the variation included fat mass (7%), age (2%), and experimental error including within-subject difference (2%). The rest of the variation (27%) was unexplained. This remaining difference was not explained by sex nor by differing tissue size of highly energetic organs such as the brain.

A cross-sectional study of more than 1400 subjects in Europe and the US showed that once adjusted for differences in body composition (lean and fat mass) and age, BMR has fallen over the past 35 years. The decline was also observed in a meta-analysis of more than 150 studies dating back to the early 1920s, translating into a decline in total energy expenditure of about 6%.

==Biochemistry==

About 70% of a human&#x27;s total energy expenditure is due to the basal life processes taking place in the organs of the body (see table). About 20% of one&#x27;s energy expenditure comes from physical activity and another 10% from thermogenesis, or digestion of food (&quot;postprandial thermogenesis&quot;). All of these processes require an intake of oxygen along with coenzymes to provide energy for survival (usually from macronutrients like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) and expel carbon dioxide, due to processing by the Krebs cycle.

For the BMR, most of the energy is consumed in maintaining fluid levels in tissues through osmoregulation, and only about one-tenth is consumed for mechanical work, such as digestion, heartbeat, and breathing.

What enables the Krebs cycle to perform metabolic changes to fats, carbohydrates, and proteins is energy, which can be defined as the ability or capacity to do work. The breakdown of large molecules into smaller molecules—associated with release of energy—is catabolism. The building up process is termed anabolism. The breakdown of proteins into amino acids is an example of catabolism, while the formation of proteins from amino acids is an anabolic process.

Exergonic reactions are energy-releasing reactions and are generally catabolic. Endergonic reactions require energy and include anabolic reactions and the contraction of muscle. Metabolism is the total of all catabolic, exergonic, anabolic, and endergonic reactions.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the intermediate molecule that drives the exergonic transfer of energy to switch to endergonic anabolic reactions used in muscle contraction. This is what causes muscles to work which can require a breakdown, and also to build in the rest period, which occurs during the strengthening phase associated with muscular contraction. ATP is composed of adenine, a nitrogen containing base, ribose, a five carbon sugar (collectively called adenosine), and three phosphate groups. ATP is a high energy molecule because it stores large amounts of energy in the chemical bonds of the two terminal phosphate groups. The breaking of these chemical bonds in the Krebs Cycle provides the energy needed for muscular contraction.

===Glucose===
Because the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms in all carbohydrates is always the same as that in water—that is, 2 to 1—all of the oxygen consumed by the cells is used to oxidize the carbon in the carbohydrate molecule to form carbon dioxide. Consequently, during the complete oxidation of a glucose molecule, six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water are produced and six molecules of oxygen are consumed.

The overall equation for this reaction is

: &lt;chem&gt;C6H12O6 + 6 O2 -&gt; 6 CO2 + 6 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

(30–32 ATP molecules produced depending on type of mitochondrial shuttle, 5–5.33 ATP molecules per molecule of oxygen.)

Because the gas exchange in this reaction is equal, the respiratory quotient (R.Q.) for carbohydrate is unity or 1.0:

: formula_8

===Fats===
The chemical composition for fats differs from that of carbohydrates in that fats contain considerably fewer oxygen atoms in proportion to atoms of carbon and hydrogen. When listed on nutritional information tables, fats are generally divided into six categories: total fats, saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid, dietary cholesterol, and trans fatty acid. From a basal metabolic or resting metabolic perspective, more energy is needed to burn a saturated fatty acid than an unsaturated fatty acid. The fatty acid molecule is broken down and categorized based on the number of carbon atoms in its molecular structure. The chemical equation for metabolism of the twelve to sixteen carbon atoms in a saturated fatty acid molecule shows the difference between metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids. Palmitic acid is a commonly studied example of the saturated fatty acid molecule.

The overall equation for the substrate utilization of palmitic acid is

: &lt;chem&gt;C16H32O2 + 23 O2 -&gt; 16 CO2 + 16 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

(106 ATP molecules produced, 4.61 ATP molecules per molecule of oxygen.)

Thus the R.Q. for palmitic acid is 0.696:

: formula_9

===Proteins===
Proteins are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen arranged in a variety of ways to form a large combination of amino acids. Unlike fat the body has no storage deposits of protein. All of it is contained in the body as important parts of tissues, blood hormones, and enzymes. The structural components of the body that contain these amino acids are continually undergoing a process of breakdown and replacement. The respiratory quotient for protein metabolism can be demonstrated by the chemical equation for oxidation of albumin:

: &lt;chem&gt;C72H112N18O22S + 77 O2 -&gt; 63 CO2 + 38 H2O + SO3 + 9 CO(NH2)2&lt;/chem&gt;

The R.Q. for albumin is 0.818:

: formula_10

The reason this is important in the process of understanding protein metabolism is that the body can blend the three macronutrients and based on the mitochondrial density, a preferred ratio can be established which determines how much fuel is utilized in which packets for work accomplished by the muscles. Protein catabolism (breakdown) has been estimated to supply 10% to 15% of the total energy requirement during a two-hour aerobic training session. This process could severely degrade the protein structures needed to maintain survival such as contractile properties of proteins in the heart, cellular mitochondria, myoglobin storage, and metabolic enzymes within muscles.

The oxidative system (aerobic) is the primary source of ATP supplied to the body at rest and during low intensity activities and uses primarily carbohydrates and fats as substrates. Protein is not normally metabolized significantly, except during long term starvation and long bouts of exercise (greater than 90 minutes.) At rest approximately 70% of the ATP produced is derived from fats and 30% from carbohydrates. Following the onset of activity, as the intensity of the exercise increases, there is a shift in substrate preference from fats to carbohydrates. During high intensity aerobic exercise, almost 100% of the energy is derived from carbohydrates, if an adequate supply is available.

===Aerobic vs. anaerobic exercise===
Studies published in 1992 and 1997 indicate that the level of aerobic fitness of an individual does not have any correlation with the level of resting metabolism. Both studies find that aerobic fitness levels do not improve the predictive power of fat free mass for resting metabolic rate.

However, recent research from the Journal of Applied Physiology, published in 2012, compared resistance training and aerobic training on body mass and fat mass in overweight adults (STRRIDE AT/RT). When time commitment is evaluated against health benefit, aerobic training is the optimal mode of exercise for reducing fat mass and body mass as a primary consideration, and resistance training is good as a secondary factor when aging and lean mass are a concern. Resistance training causes injuries at a much higher rate than aerobic training. Compared to resistance training, it was found that aerobic training resulted in a significantly more pronounced reduction of body weight by enhancing the cardiovascular system which is what is the principal factor in metabolic utilization of fat substrates. Resistance training if time is available is also helpful in post-exercise metabolism, but it is an adjunctive factor because the body needs to heal sufficiently between resistance training episodes, whereas the body can accept aerobic training every day. RMR and BMR are measurements of daily consumption of calories. The majority of studies that are published on this topic look at aerobic exercise because of its efficacy for health and weight management.

Anaerobic exercise, such as weight lifting, builds additional muscle mass. Muscle contributes to the fat-free mass of an individual and therefore effective results from anaerobic exercise will increase BMR. However, the actual effect on BMR is controversial and difficult to enumerate. Various studies suggest that the resting metabolic rate of trained muscle is around 55 kJ/kg per day; it then follows that even a substantial increase in muscle say would make only a minor impact on BMR.

==Longevity==

In 1926, Raymond Pearl proposed that longevity varies inversely with basal metabolic rate (the &quot;rate of living hypothesis&quot;). Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that mammals with larger body size have longer maximum life spans (large animals do have higher total metabolic rates, but the metabolic rate at the cellular level is much lower, and the breathing rate and heartbeat are slower in larger animals) and the fact that the longevity of fruit flies varies inversely with ambient temperature. Additionally, the life span of houseflies can be extended by preventing physical activity. This theory has been bolstered by several new studies linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy, across the animal kingdom—including humans. Calorie restriction and reduced thyroid hormone levels, both of which decrease the metabolic rate, have been associated with higher longevity in animals.

However, the ratio of total daily energy expenditure to resting metabolic rate can vary between 1.6 and 8.0 between species of mammals. Animals also vary in the degree of coupling between oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, the amount of saturated fat in mitochondrial membranes, the amount of DNA repair, and many other factors that affect maximum life span.

One problem with understanding the associations of lifespan and metabolism is that changes in metabolism are often confounded by other factors that may affect lifespan. For example under calorie restriction whole body metabolic rate goes down with increasing levels of restriction, but body temperature also follows the same pattern. By manipulating the ambient temperature and exposure to wind it was shown in mice and hamsters that body temperature is a more important modulator of lifespan than metabolic rate.

==Medical considerations==
A person&#x27;s metabolism varies with their physical condition and activity. Weight training can have a longer impact on metabolism than aerobic training, but there are no known mathematical formulas that can exactly predict the length and duration of a raised metabolism from trophic changes with anabolic neuromuscular training.

A decrease in food intake will typically lower the metabolic rate as the body tries to conserve energy. Researcher Gary Foster estimates that a very low calorie diet of fewer than 800 calories a day would reduce the metabolic rate by more than 10 percent.

The metabolic rate can be affected by some drugs: antithyroid agents (drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism) such as propylthiouracil and methimazole bring the metabolic rate down to normal, restoring euthyroidism. Some research has focused on developing antiobesity drugs to raise the metabolic rate, such as drugs to stimulate thermogenesis in skeletal muscle.

The metabolic rate may be elevated in stress, illness, and diabetes. Menopause may also affect metabolism.

<doc id="562794" wikidata="Q4736601" url="?curid=562794" title="Alternative vote plus">
<text>The alternative vote plus (AV+), or alternative vote top-up, is a semi-proportional voting system. AV+ was devised by the 1998 Jenkins Commission which first proposed the idea as a system that could be used for elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

AV+ a variant of the additional member system which works in two parts: the &#x27;AV&#x27; part and the &#x27;plus&#x27; part. As in the alternative vote system, candidates are ranked numerically in order of preference. The important difference is that an additional group of members would be elected through regional party lists to ensure a degree of proportionality; in typical proposals, these members are 15–20% of the whole body. More specifically, each voter would get a second vote to elect a county or regional-level representative from a list of candidates of more than one person per party. The number of votes cast in this vote would decide how many representatives from that county or region would go on to parliament. In systems with an electoral threshold on regional seats, votes are transferred in order of voters&#x27; numerical preference until it puts a party above the threshold, or reaches a party already above.

== Reaction in the UK ==
Then Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement, saying that the report &quot;makes a well-argued and powerful case for the system it recommends&quot; and that &quot;it is very much a modification of the existing Westminster system, rather than any full blown PR system as practised in other countries.&quot; He also praised Lord Jenkins for his work and gave the recommendations a cautious welcome, pointing out in particular that change would help address the &quot;complete absence of Conservative representation in Scotland&quot;, a reference to the then most recent election in which the Conservatives failed to win a single seat in Scotland, despite winning 17.5% of the Scottish vote.

However, leading figures in the Cabinet at the time (such as Home Secretary Jack Straw, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, Chancellor Gordon Brown, and Margaret Beckett) and the Labour NEC, all strongly opposed reform of the voting system, and blocked change at that time. 

The report was welcomed by the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, although at the time the Liberal Democrats remained largely committed to STV, but preferred AV+ to first-past-the-post.
The report was heavily criticised by the Conservative party, with leader William Hague branding its proposals &quot;a dog&#x27;s breakfast&quot;.

In a May 2009 article in &quot;The Times&quot;, Health Secretary Alan Johnson called for a referendum on the adoption of this system as part of the response to the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal. In this piece he praised the system as &quot;an elegant solution&quot;. David Cameron, Leader of the Conservative Party, declared on May 26 that his party did not support the AV+ system, or any other form of proportional representation, as it would end up choosing a government &quot;on the basis of secret backroom deals&quot;.

In June 2009, it was reported by the BBC that the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was considering changing the electoral system as part of a package of constitutional reform. In February 2010, the Labour government under Gordon Brown offered a Commons vote on a referendum for an alternative vote system, possibly manoeuvering for political positioning in case of a hung parliament following the general election on May 6. In a BBC interview on Election Night 2010, Home Secretary Alan Johnson suggested he would like to see the AV+ system introduced if a deal with the Liberal Democrats became necessary.

A national referendum on the Alternative Vote system was granted as part of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement, but not AV+. The Jenkins Commission rejected plain AV on the basis that it did little to relieve disproportionality, but favoured it over first-past-the-post as the basis for AV+.

The referendum on AV was held on 5 May 2011. Voters rejected the proposed AV voting system by a vote of 68% to 32% in favour of retaining First Past the Post. The turnout of registered voters was 42%.

== Properties ==
AV+ has several properties which may be considered advantages or disadvantages based on ones views on how an electoral system should work and what effects it should produce. Common arguments in favour or against are similar to those relating to its component systems, AV and AMS.

* Single-member constituencies would exist under the scheme, so every voter would have a local MP, but not all MPs would be elected in an SMD.
* Because of compensation (additional seats), results would be more proportional result than FPTP or AV, but would still give a built-in advantage to the largest party and allow one-party rule during landslide years. Coalition governments, which include the opinions of multiple movements of the people, are more likely.
* Would lessen the problems of &#x27;split voting&#x27; and the necessity of tactical voting.
* Decreases the chances of &#x27;safe seats&#x27; and MPs holding seats for life.
* MPs will have to secure 50% of votes to win a constituency seat - making them more accountable and working harder to win over a broader appeal. Limits the chances for extremists to gain power scraping in with minority support. The AV part shuts down the ability for local candidates to slip in with just a minority of the votes.

* It is more complex than FPTP for voters and it might cost more to count the votes
* It will lead to &quot;two types of MP&quot;, as a majority would be linked directly to a constituency with a minority with a larger area overlapping the first group. This might weaken the psychological link between voters and their representatives.

<text>The Defence Forces (, officially styled ) are the armed forces of Ireland. They encompass the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, and Reserve Defence Forces.

The Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces is the President of Ireland. All Defence Forces officers hold their commission from the President, but in practice, the Minister for Defence acts on the President&#x27;s behalf and reports to the Government of Ireland. The Minister for Defence is advised by the Council of Defence on the business of the Department of Defence.

As of December 2023, there were 7,550 permanent personnel in the Defence Forces out of an established strength of 9,500, a decrease from September 2020 when there were 8,529 personnel, comprising 6,878 Army, 752 Air Corps and 899 Naval Service personnel. As of August 2024, there were also 1,720 personnel in the Reserve Defence Force out of an established strength of 4,069.

== Role ==
The Irish state has a long-standing policy of non-belligerence in armed conflicts, including neutrality in World War II. Ireland&#x27;s military capabilities are modest. However, the state has a long history of involvement in United Nations peacekeeping operations. Functions of the Defence Forces include:

*Preparation for the defence of the state against armed attack.
*Assisting the police force, the Garda Síochána, including the protection of the internal security of the state.
*Peacekeeping, crisis management and humanitarian relief operations in support of the United Nations.
*Policing the fisheries, in accordance with the state&#x27;s obligations under European Union agreements.
*Miscellaneous civil contingency duties requested by the government such as search and rescue, air ambulance provision, providing secure air transport for ministers, assistance in the event of natural and other disasters, ensuring the maintenance of essential services, and assisting in dealing with oil pollution at sea.

==History==
The Defence Forces trace their origins to the Irish Volunteers, founded in 1913. Their official Irish-language title, Óglaigh na hÉireann, is taken from the equivalent Irish-language title of the Irish Volunteers, as are their cap badge and the buttons worn on ceremonial uniforms (the buttons are still marked with the initials &quot;IV&quot;).

The Irish Volunteers were central to the Easter Rising staged in April 1916. After the rising, the Volunteers gave allegiance to the First Dáil, the parliament of the revolutionary Irish Republic. At this time the Volunteers became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA). From 1919 onwards, the IRA waged a guerrilla campaign against British rule in Ireland that is now known as the War of Independence.

A truce in July 1921 brought hostilities to an end; the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on 6 December. The Provisional Government was then constituted on 14 January 1922. The IRA divided between those who accepted the decision of the Dáil in ratifying the Treaty and those who did not: consequently, both civil war and re-occupation by the British became possible. In February 1922, the pro-treaty IRA became the National Army of the Irish Free State. With declining relations between the remaining units of the anti-treaty IRA and the newly recruited pro-treaty National Army, the Irish Civil War broke out on 28 June 1922. It ended in victory for the National Army when, on 24 May 1923, the anti-treaty IRA Chief of Staff, Frank Aiken ordered his volunteers to dump arms.

On 3 August 1923 the new state passed the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, raising &quot;an armed force to be called Oglaigh na hEireann (hereinafter referred to as the Forces) consisting of such number of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men as may from time to time be provided by the Oireachtas the new parliament of the Irish Free State.&quot; The Forces were established on 1 October 1924.

The state was officially neutral during World War II but declared an official state of emergency on 2 September 1939 and the Army was mobilised. As the Emergency progressed, more and newer equipment was purchased for the rapidly expanding force from Britain and the United States as well as some manufactured at home. For the duration of the Emergency, Ireland, while formally neutral, tacitly supported the Allies in several ways. Allied aircraft were allowed to access the Atlantic Ocean via the Donegal Corridor. German military personnel were interned in the Curragh along with the belligerent powers&#x27; servicemen, whereas Allied airmen and sailors who crashed in Ireland were very often repatriated, usually by secretly moving them across the border to Northern Ireland. G2, the Army&#x27;s intelligence section, played a vital role in the detection and arrest of German spies, such as Hermann Görtz.

In September 1946, the Naval Service was established as Ireland&#x27;s maritime force and as a permanent component of the Defence Forces.

Ireland became a member of the United Nations in 1955. The first contribution to peacekeeping was in 1958 when Army officers were assigned to the United Nations Observation Group in Lebanon (UNOGIL). Since 1958 the Defence Forces have had a continuous presence on armed United Nations peacekeeping operations, except between May 1974 to May 1978 (although they did retain overseas unarmed observer missions during this period). The first armed peacekeeping mission was to the Operation des Nations Unies au Congo (ONUC) in 1960. During the ONUC mission, a company from the Irish Army were involved in a battle at Jadotville, in which the Irish held out against a larger Katangese force. A memorial to Irish personnel who served as United Nations peacekeepers was unveiled in 2009 in the town of Fermoy, recording that there was a total of ninety Irish fatalities while on active service with the UN until that date.

During the Troubles, the period of civil conflict centred on Northern Ireland from 1969 to 1998, the Defence Forces deployed to aid the Garda Síochána. Troops were deployed for duty to the border areas, new border military posts were established, and in 1973 new permanent border units were established. In 1969-70, there were proposals considered for a limited military intervention in Northern Ireland to protect the nationalist community, known as Exercise Armageddon, but it was seen to be unworkable and was not adopted by the cabinet. Although units were moved to the border region in 1969–70 during the Battle of the Bogside, in order to provide medical support to those wounded in the fighting. In 1974, troops were deployed to maximum-security prisons in Portlaoise and Limerick where IRA prisoners were detained. Armed troops were deployed in 1976 to all major post offices during a three-month national bank strike. In 1978, cash-in-transit escorts were established to protect large cash movements throughout the state, continuing until 2014. The Central Bank of Ireland had the Government put in place contingency plans to provide armed Defence Force security for major Irish banks over public order fears if a cash shortage was triggered at the height of the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Tasks in military aid to the civil power continue today, but no longer to the same degree or intensity.

== Funding and development ==

In 2020, the Irish defence budget was €1.04bn. This included €780m on defence and €259m on army pensions. Department of Defence spending was 0.27% of GDP in 2020 and 0.29% in 2019.

In 2022, the defence sector budget was €1.1bn and in July of that year the Irish government announced plans to increase this to €1.5bn by 2028. As part of the plans to move to &quot;Level of Action 2&quot;, as of 2022, the number of civil and military personnel was set to be increased from 9,500 to 11,500. Planning also began for improvements in radar capabilities. The Defence Forces specified the procurement of an integrated radar system for land, sea and air function and that the Army&#x27;s structures and capabilities would be redesigned to meet &quot;international best practice&quot;. The plan also proposed the establishment of an Office of Reserve Affairs to design a Reserve Defence Forces &quot;regeneration plan&quot;. 

The projected budget for 2024 was €1.5bn, including an extra €21m over previous expenditure and €34m in capital expenditure on top of the original capital ceiling of the National Development Plan. This also included budget for an additional 400 enlisted personnel during 2024.
== Organisation ==
The Defence Forces are organised under the Chief of Staff, supported by Deputy Chief of Staff Operations, and the Deputy Chief of Staff Support. They consist of a Permanent Defence Force (PDF), which is a standing force and provides the main capability for military operations, and the Reserve Defence Forces (RDF), military reserve forces which support the PDF if necessary. The PDF is organised into three service branches: the Army, the Naval Service, and the Air Corps. The RDF may be further subdivided into a First Line Reserve (FLR) and a Second Line Reserve; the First Line Reserve comprises former members of the Permanent Defence Force, while the Second Line Reserve comprises an Army Reserve and a Naval Service Reserve (both recruited directly from the civilian population). A reorganization of the RDF in 2013, referred to as the &quot;single force concept&quot;, has resulted in units of the RDF being embedded within units of the PDF, rather than existing entirely in parallel as a separate reserve force; this moves away from the traditional approach of the RDF being considered a fourth service branch of the Defence Forces.

In January 2022, the Commission on the Defence Forces recommended the establishment of an &#x27;Information Command&#x27;, under the command of a general, to handle cyberattacks and misinformation.

===Army===


As of December 2023, the Army had approximately 6,136 active personnel, with 1,351 personnel in the Army Reserve. Up to late 2012 the army had three brigades: 1 Southern, 2 Eastern and 4 Western; in 2012, 4 Western Brigade stood down at its HQ Custume Barracks, Athlone. The state is now divided into two Brigade areas for administrative and operational reasons, with the former 4 Western Brigade split between the other two brigades. In addition to the brigade structure, there is also the Defence Forces Training Centre, a logistics base in the Curragh.

The two-brigade structure envisages distinct operational areas of responsibility for each of the brigades. The 1st Brigade has primary responsibility for operational tasks in the southern region, while the 2nd Brigade leads on operational tasks in the eastern and western regions. Practical operational considerations dictate the requirement to outline operational areas of responsibility. The brigade structure is based on strengthened combat and combat-support elements, together with streamlined combat-service-support elements.

The Army has nine specialist corps, each designated as either combat, combat support or combat service support. These are the Infantry Corps, Artillery Corps, Cavalry Corps, Engineer Corps, Ordnance Corps, Medical Corps, Transport Corps, Military Police Corps, and the Communications and Information Services Corps. In the case of corps which support the infantry, a Corps Director and staff are provided to coordinate the purchase of specialised equipment, the execution of specialised training, and other necessary activities.

Irish infantry are equipped with assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, hand grenades, and anti-tank weapons. Most weapons used by their defence forces follow NATO standards and are purchased from abroad, with Ireland having a very limited arms industry. The Army has light armoured vehicles, with the primary vehicle being the MOWAG Piranha, armed with machine guns. Its artillery capabilities consist of 120mm mortars and 105mm light guns.

The Army Ranger Wing (ARW) are the special forces of Ireland. They are based at the Curragh.

===Air Corps===


The Air Corps is the air component of the Defence Forces. Its HQ is at Casement (Baldonnel) Aerodrome. The Air Corps is the smallest of the branches of the Defence Forces, with approximately 689 personnel, and its primary roles are defined as:
#Support of the Army
#Support of the Naval Service
#Aid to the civil power

There are two secondary roles:
#Aid to the civil community
#Aid to government departments

The Air Corps provides support to the Army and Naval Service, together with non-military air services such as the Emergency Aeromedical (air ambulance) Service, VIP transport, and search and rescue (in support of Coast Guard search and rescue efforts). The Air Corps is unable to provide the traditional air force role of defending Irish airspace as it has no fighter aircraft.

The Air Corps has two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft equipped with detection systems to assist the Naval Service in patrolling Ireland&#x27;s territorial waters and exclusive economic zone. These aircraft are also used for high-altitude, low-opening parachuting by the Army&#x27;s ARW. The Air Corps has six AgustaWestland AW139 utility helicopters capable of being armed with FN MAG machine guns. These are used in support of the ARW, Naval Service and Garda Síochána operations, and are the only helicopters within the state capable of flying at night in mountain terrain using night-vision technology. The eight Pilatus PC-9 turboprop trainers can be equipped with rocket pods and machine guns, and two Eurocopter EC135 light utility helicopters (which can be used as sniper platforms by the ARW) are used for training pilots and for air-ambulance missions.

The Air Corps conducted over 130 maritime surveillance patrol flights in 2019, and provided medical support to the HSE for patients by conducting over 233 Emergency Aeromedical Service missions and 32 inter-hospital air ambulance transfers.

===Naval Service===


The Naval Service maintains a complement of approximately 725 active personnel and 97 reserve personnel and is tasked with patrolling Irish territorial waters as well as the Irish Conservation Box, a large area of sea in which fishing is restricted to preserve fish numbers. It is tasked with enforcing this European-Union-protected area and thus serves the EU as well as Ireland. Together with the Air Corps and Customs, it has intercepted a number of vessels carrying narcotics to and from Ireland.

The Naval Service has six patrol vessels (2xP50, 4xP60) which are operated in support of the service&#x27;s primary roles, inflatable seagoing craft, and training vessels. It maintains highly-trained armed boarding parties that can seize a vessel if necessary. In 2019, for example, there were approximately 780 boarding operations and 12 vessels were detained . The service&#x27;s specialised diving unit is the Naval Service Diving Section.

The primary role is defined as &quot;National Security&quot;, with secondary roles which include:
# Fishery protection
# Aid to the civil power
# Drug interdiction
# Maritime safety
# Diving operations
# Pollution control
# Overseas mission support

===Reserve Defence Forces===
The Reserve Defence Forces (RDF) in its current form was established in October 2005 and comprises the First Line Reserve, Army Reserve (AR) and Naval Service Reserve (NSR). The RDF is a part-time, voluntary component of the Defence Forces in peacetime, supporting the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF) in its domestic roles and training alongside its professional full-time colleagues as part of the &quot;Single Force Concept&quot; whereby RDF units are integrated with their PDF counterparts, coming under the one command. As of August 2024, there were 1,720 reservists out of an established strength of 4,096, consisting of 167 in the First Line Reserve, 1,456 in the Army Reserve, and 97 in the Naval Service Reserve.

==Representative associations==
The interests of members of the Defence Forces are represented by a number of representative associations, similar to trade unions (which Irish military personnel are banned from joining). Officers of the PDF are represented by the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, Rank-and-file members of the PDF are represented by the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA), which is affiliated to the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations and to the European Organisation of Military Associations, EUROMIL. In 2009, members of PDFORRA took part in an Irish Congress of Trade Unions protest against the government&#x27;s handling of the post-2008 Irish economic downturn, at which time the Department of Defence warned that Defence Forces members could not take part in or sponsor any &quot;public agitation&quot;, and that PDFORRA had &quot;no express permission&quot; for members to take part in the protests. All ranks of the RDF are represented by the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association (RDFRA).

Complaints concerning and made by serving and former members of the Defence Forces can be investigated by the independent Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces (ODF), in cases where internal grievance procedures within the DF have been exhausted.

<text>Charles Borromeo (; ; 2 October 1538 – 3 November 1584) was an Italian Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Milan from 1564 to 1584. He was made a cardinal in 1560. 

Borromeo founded the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine and was a leading figure of the Counter-Reformation together with Ignatius of Loyola and Philip Neri. In that role, he was responsible for significant reforms in the Catholic Church, including the founding of seminaries for the education of priests. He was canonized in 1610 and his feast day is 4 November.

==Early life==
Borromeo was a descendant of nobility; the Borromeo family was one of the most ancient and wealthy in Lombardy, made famous by several notable men, both in the church and state. The family coat of arms included the Borromean rings, which are sometimes taken to symbolize the Holy Trinity. Borromeo&#x27;s father Gilbert was Count of Arona. His mother Margaret was a member of the Milan branch of the House of Medici. The second son in a family of six children, he was born in the castle of Arona on Lake Maggiore 36 miles from Milan on 2 October 1538.

Borromeo received the tonsure when he was about twelve years old. At this time his paternal uncle Giulio Cesare Borromeo turned over to him the income from the rich Benedictine abbey of Sts. Gratinian and Felin, one of the ancient perquisites of the family. Borromeo made plain to his father that all revenues from the abbey beyond what was required to prepare him for a career in the church belonged to the poor and could not be applied to secular use. The young man attended the University of Pavia, where he applied himself to the study of civil and canon law. Due to a slight speech impediment, he was regarded as slow but his thoroughness and industry meant that he made rapid progress. In 1554 his father died, and although he had an elder brother, Count Federico, he was requested by the family to take the management of their domestic affairs. After a time, he resumed his studies, and on 6 December 1559, he earned a doctorate in canon and civil law.

==Rome period==
On 25 December 1559 Borromeo&#x27;s uncle Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Medici was elected as Pope Pius IV. The newly elected pope required his nephew to come to Rome, and on 13 January 1560 appointed him protonotary apostolic. Shortly thereafter, on 31 January 1560, the pope created him cardinal, and thus Borromeo as cardinal-nephew was entrusted with both the public and the privy seal of the ecclesiastical state. He was also brought into the government of the Papal States and appointed a supervisor of the Franciscans, Carmelites and Knights of Malta.

During his four years in Rome, Borromeo lived in austerity, obliged the Roman Curia to wear black, and established an academy of learned persons, the Academy of the Vatican Knights, publishing their memoirs as the &quot;Noctes Vaticanae&quot;.

Borromeo organized the third and last session of the Council of Trent, in 1562–63. He had a large share in the making of the Tridentine Catechism (&quot;Catechismus Romanus&quot;). In 1561, Borromeo founded and endowed a college at Pavia, today known as Almo Collegio Borromeo, which he dedicated to Justina of Padua.

On 19 November 1562, his older brother, Federico, suddenly died. His family urged Borromeo to seek permission to return to the lay state (laicization), to marry and have children so that the family name would not become extinct, but he decided not to leave the ecclesiastic state. His brother&#x27;s death, along with his contacts with the Jesuits and the Theatines and the example of bishops such as Bartholomew of Braga, were the causes of the conversion of Borromeo towards a more strict and operative Christian life, and his aim became to put into practice the dignity and duties of the bishop as drafted by the recent Council of Trent.

==Archbishop of Milan==
Borromeo was appointed an administrator of the Archdiocese of Milan on 7 February 1560. After his decision to put into practice the role of bishop, he decided to be ordained priest (4 September 1563) and on 7 December 1563 he was consecrated bishop in the Sistine Chapel by Cardinal Giovanni Serbelloni. Borromeo was formally appointed archbishop of Milan on 12 May 1564 after the former archbishop Ippolito II d&#x27;Este waived his claims on that archbishopric, but he was only allowed by the pope to leave Rome one year later. Borromeo made his formal entry into Milan as archbishop on 23 September 1565.

===Reform in Milan===
After the death of his uncle, Pius IV (1566), Borromeo sent a galley to fetch Cardinal Ugo Boncompagni, the Nuncio in Spain, but he did not arrive in time to be considered at the conclave. Borromeo then reached an agreement with Alessandro Farnese, who held a significant number of votes, to support Antonio Ghislieri, who was rumored to have the support of Philip II of Spain. Ghislieri was elected and took the name Pius V.

Before Borromeo went to Milan, while he was overseeing reform in Rome, a nobleman remarked that the latter city was no longer a place to enjoy oneself or to make a fortune. &quot;Carlo Borromeo has undertaken to remake the city from top to bottom,&quot; he said, predicting that the reformer&#x27;s enthusiasm &quot;would lead him to correct the rest of the world once he has finished with Rome.&quot;

Subsequently, he devoted himself to the reformation of his diocese which had deteriorated in practice owing to the 80-year absence of previous archbishops. Milan was the largest archdiocese in Italy at the time, with more than 3,000 clergy and 800,000 people. Both its clergy and laity had drifted from church teaching. The selling of indulgences and ecclesiastical positions was prevalent; monasteries were &quot;full of disorder&quot;; many religious were &quot;lazy, ignorant, and debauched&quot;.

Borromeo made numerous pastoral visits and restored dignity to divine service. He urged churches to be designed in conformity with the decrees of the Council of Trent, which stated that sacred art and architecture lacking adequate scriptural foundation was in effect prohibited, as was any inclusion of classical pagan elements in religious art. He divided the nave of the church into two compartments to separate the sexes at worship. He extended his reforms to the collegiate churches, monasteries and even to the Confraternities of Penitents, particularly that of St. John the Baptist. This group was to attend to prisoners and those condemned to death, to give them help and support.

Borromeo believed that abuses in the church arose from ignorant clergy. Among his most important actions, he established seminaries, colleges, and communities for the education of candidates for holy orders. His emphasis on Catholic learning greatly increased the preparation of men for the priesthood and benefited their congregations. In addition, he founded the fraternity of Oblates of St. Ambrose, a society of secular men who did not take orders, but devoted themselves to the church and followed a discipline of monastic prayers and study. They provided assistance to parishes when so directed. The new archbishop&#x27;s efforts for catechesis and the instruction of youth included the initiation of the first &quot;Sunday School&quot; classes and the work of the Confraternity for Christian Doctrine.

Borromeo&#x27;s diocesan reforms faced opposition from several religious orders, particularly that of the Humiliati (Brothers of Humility), a penitential order which, although reduced to about 170 members, owned some ninety monasteries. Some members of that society formed a conspiracy against his life, and a shot was fired at him with an arquebus in the archepiscopal chapel. His survival was considered miraculous.

In 1576 there was famine at Milan due to crop failures, and later an outbreak of the plague. The city&#x27;s trade fell off, and along with it the people&#x27;s source of income. The Governor and many members of the nobility fled the city, but the bishop remained, to organize the care of those affected and to minister to the dying. He called together the superiors of all the religious communities in the diocese and won their cooperation. Borromeo tried to feed 60,000 to 70,000 people daily. He used up his own funds and went into debt to provide food for the hungry. Finally, he wrote to the Governor and successfully persuaded him to return.

===Influence on English affairs===

Borromeo had also been involved in English affairs when he assisted Pius IV. Many English Catholics had fled to Italy at this time because of the persecutions under Queen Elizabeth I. He gave pastoral attention to English Catholics who fled to Italy to escape the new laws against the Catholic faith. Edmund Campion, a Jesuit, and Ralph Sherwin visited him at Milan in 1580 on their way to England. They stayed with him for eight days, talking with him every night after dinner. A Welshman, Grudfydd Robert, served as his canon theologian and an Englishman, Thomas Goldwell, as vicar-general. The archbishop carried on his person a small picture of John Fisher, who with Thomas More had been executed during the reign of Henry VIII and for whom he held a great veneration. During the 19th century Catholic restoration in England, Nicholas Wiseman was to institute an order of Oblates of St Charles, led by Henry Edward Manning, as a congregation of secular priests directly supporting the Archbishop of Westminster.

===Persecution of religious dissidents===
Though the Diet of Ilanz of 1524 and 1526 had proclaimed freedom of worship in the Three Leagues, Borromeo repressed Protestantism in the Swiss valleys. The Catholic Encyclopedia relates: &quot;In November [1583] he began a visitation as Apostolic visitor of all the cantons of Switzerland and the Grisons, leaving the affairs of his diocese in the hands of Monsignor Owen Lewis, his vicar-general. He began in the Valle Mesolcina; here not only was there heresy to be fought, but also witchcraft and sorcery, and at Roveredo it was discovered that &#x27;the provost or rector, was the foremost in sorceries&#x27;&quot;. During his pastoral visit to the region, 150 people were arrested for practicing witchcraft. Eleven women and the provost were condemned by the civil authorities to be burned alive.

Reacting to the pressure of the Protestant Reformation, Borromeo encouraged Ludwig Pfyffer in his development of the &quot;Golden League&quot; but did not live to see its formation in 1586. Based in Lucerne, the organization (also called the Borromean League) linked activities of several Swiss Catholic cantons of Switzerland, which became the centre of Catholic Counter-Reformation efforts and was determined to expel heretics. It created severe strains in the Swiss civil administration and caused the break-up of Appenzell canton along religious lines.

==Controversy and last days==
Charged with implementing the reforms dictated by the Council of Trent, Borromeo&#x27;s uncompromising stance brought him into conflict with secular leaders, priests, and even the Pope. He met with much opposition to his reforms. The governor of the province and many of the senators addressed complaints to the courts of Rome and Madrid.

In 1584, during his annual retreat at Monte Varallo, he fell ill with &quot;intermittent fever and ague&quot;, and on returning to Milan grew rapidly worse. After receiving the Last Rites, he quietly died on 3 November at the age of 46.

==Veneration==
Following his death, popular devotion to Borromeo arose quickly and continued to grow. The Milanese celebrated his anniversary as though he were already a saint, and supporters in a number of cities collected documentation to support his canonization. In 1602 Clement VIII beatified Borromeo. In 1604 his case was sent to the Congregation of Rites. On 1 November 1610, Pope Paul V canonized Borromeo. Three years later, the church added his feast to the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 4 November. Along with Guarinus of Palestrina and perhaps Anselm of Lucca, he is one of only two or three cardinal-nephews to have been canonized.

Charles Borromeo is the patron saint of bishops, catechists and seminarians.

===Iconography===
Borromeo&#x27;s emblem is the Latin word &quot;humilitas&quot; (humility), which is a portion of the Borromeo shield. He is usually represented in art in his robes, barefoot, carrying the cross as archbishop, a rope around his neck, one hand raised in blessing, thus recalling his work during the plague.

==Sources==
Borromeo&#x27; biography was originally written by three of his contemporaries: Agostino Valerio (afterwards cardinal and Bishop of Verona) and Carlo Bascape (General of the Barnabites, afterwards Bishop of Novara), who wrote their contributions in Latin, and Pietro Giussanno (a priest), who wrote his in Italian. Giussanno&#x27;s account was the most detailed of the three.

==Legacy==
Borromeo&#x27;s correspondence shows his influential position in Europe during his lifetime. The popes under whom he served sought his advice. The Catholic sovereigns of Europe – Henry III of France, Philip II of Spain, Mary, Queen of Scots – and others showed how they valued his influence. Cardinal Valerio of Verona said of him that Borromeo was &quot;to the well-born a pattern of virtue, to his brother cardinals an example of true nobility.&quot; Cardinal Baronius styled him &quot;a second Ambrose, whose early death, lamented by all good men, inflicted great loss on the Church.&quot;

Late in the sixteenth or at the beginning of the seventeenth century, Catholics in England circulated among themselves a &quot;Life of St. Charles&quot;.

===Monuments===
* Contrary to Borromeo&#x27;s last wishes, the Duomo di Milano created a memorial crypt to honour him at the church.
* His relative Federico Borromeo and admirers commissioned a statue 20 m high that was erected on the hill above Arona, as they regarded him an important leader of the Counter-Reformation.

===Writings===
* Besides the &quot;Noctes Vaticanae&quot;, to which he appeared to have contributed, Borromeo&#x27;s written legacy consisted only of some homilies, discourses and sermons, with a collection of letters. Borromeo&#x27;s sermons have been translated into many languages.

<text>Jay Taylor Last (October 18, 1929 – November 11, 2021) was an American physicist, silicon pioneer, and member of the so-called &quot;traitorous eight&quot; that founded Silicon Valley.

==Early life and education==
Last was born in Butler, Pennsylvania, on October 18, 1929, at the beginning of the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and grew up during the Great Depression. Both his parents were teachers, but his father left teaching to work in a steel mill in hopes of earning a better living. During the depression, there was no work in the steel mills, but the family managed by growing and preserving its own food. During World War II, his father worked six to seven days a week, 12 hours a day, under demanding and dangerous physical conditions. Jay Last enjoyed hiking, walking, and exploring while growing up. Between his junior and senior years of school, at age 16, he and a friend hitch-hiked to San Jose, California, and worked for the summer picking fruit.

A voracious reader, he tended to complete his schoolwork well in advance of the rest of the class. He was encouraged by his chemistry teacher, Lucille Critchlow, who recommended him to work with Frank W. Preston, a local industrial chemist whose laboratory studied glass and glass fracture. Last began working at Preston&#x27;s lab as a high-school student and continued to work for him as a university student, whenever he had a break.

Last graduated from Butler Senior High School in 1947 and applied for a scholarship to study Optics at the University of Rochester. Last had heard about the program from his father and did not apply anywhere else. It was a rigorous program, and three-quarters of the entering class had dropped out by the time the program was finished. The program had close ties to Eastman Kodak and to Bausch &amp; Lomb: Last&#x27;s class in optical design was taught by Rudolph Kingslake of Kodak. Last worked for a summer at the trouble-shooting department of Kodak&#x27;s optical instrumentation plant, before his senior year of university. He tested a camera, to be used in the B52 aircraft, at −60 °F temperatures. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Optics from the University of Rochester in 1951. He had become increasingly interested in physics, and was encouraged by an advisor, Parker Givens, to become involved in the emerging area of solid-state physics.

After accepting an offer to study at MIT, he joined the laboratory of physicist Arthur R. von Hippel, and studied the physical structure of ferroelectric materials. He also took classes from John Clarke Slater and Victor F. Weisskopf. A material he was working with, barium titanate, underwent unusual structural changes when it became ferroelectric, requiring Last to study it using infrared spectroscopy. Last used a new instrument, a Beckman IR-3 spectrophotometer, and worked closely with staff from Beckman Instruments to report and fix problems.

He earned his Ph.D. in physics from MIT in 1956. He was attracted by the west coast, which he had visited as a student. With possibilities of working at General Electric, at Bell Laboratories, and at Beckman Instruments, he was referred by Arnold Beckman to William Shockley. Shockley was starting up Shockley Semiconductor as a division of Beckman Instruments. Shockley flew out to MIT to recruit Last, and made a vivid impression. Regarding Shockley&#x27;s arrival, Last has said, &quot;I thought, my God, I&#x27;ve never met anybody this brilliant. I changed my whole career plans and said I want to go to California and work with this man.&quot;

==Semiconductors==
=== Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory===
Last worked at the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory division of Beckman Instruments from April 1956 to September 1957. Shockley insisted on supervising each scientist individually, with little or no communication between group members. Last spent much of his time working on basic surface properties of materials, trying to explain anomalous results from four-layer silicon diodes. Last credits Shockley as being &quot;an extraordinary, brilliant man.&quot; &quot;He made right decisions. He hired a good group of people... It was the right technology, the right material, the right group of people to implement it, and wham.&quot; However, Shockley was not skilled at working with people, and his relationships with employees in the company deteriorated rapidly. In January 1957, a group of seven employees, including Last, appealed to Arnold Beckman to ask that he intervene in the company&#x27;s operations. Beckman initially seemed sympathetic, but ended up supporting Shockley.

The dissatisfied scientists included much of the core technical talent of the project: Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, and Robert Noyce. Initially looking for another company to join, they began to consider the possibility of creating their own company, with the support of Wall Street investors. They were eventually joined by C. Sheldon Roberts, and termed the &quot;Traitorous Eight&quot;. They have also been called the &quot;fathers of Silicon Valley&quot;.

=== Fairchild Semiconductor ===
On September 18, 1957, Last and the others formally resigned from Shockley Semiconductor to form Fairchild Semiconductor, as a division of Sherman Fairchild&#x27;s Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. After they broke away, they were joined by another key Shockley employee, David Allison. Last said of the new company&#x27;s goals:

At Fairchild Semiconductor Last worked as Head of Integrated Circuit Development and was instrumental in the creation of the first silicon circuit chips. Last emphasized the collaborative nature of the new company and the cooperative nature of the group working together as equals.

Fairchild&#x27;s strategy for competing in the transistor market was to be fast and flexible. Rather than tying their research and development to lengthy 1–3 year military contracts, they financed development through Fairchild Camera. This enabled them to focus on promising ideas and develop them quickly. IBM was interested in obtaining transistors for a navigation computer for the B-70 bomber. Fairchild contracted to provide transistors to meet the specifications for IBM&#x27;s core-memory driver. They developed complementary NPN and PNP transistors which could be used as a matched pair in a variety of circuit applications. Gordon Moore and David Allison worked on the NPN transistor, while Jean Hoerni developed the PNP transistor using boron diffusion. Scaling up to production of components in quantity presented major technological challenges, and Moore&#x27;s NPN transistor was ready for production before Hoerni&#x27;s PNP transistor. By August 1958, within eight months of the company&#x27;s creation, Fairchild was delivering mesa transistors to IBM. Once it became available, the mesa transistor was desired for a wide variety of military applications. The speed with which it had been developed gave Fairchild a virtual monopoly on the fast-growing market for the next year. The most significant contract came from Autonetics, which was developing the navigation and control computer for the Minuteman ICBM.

During this period, Last helped develop various transistor fabrication techniques in photo-lithography, photomasking, photoresists, and mesa etching. He helped to design a step-and-repeat camera to make photomasks and a method for aligning the masks. Many of the techniques developed at Fairchild became foundational to the creation of both transistors and integrated circuits by the semi-conductor industry.

====Integrated circuits====
In 1959, developing an idea he had noted as early as 1957, Jean Hoerni submitted two patent applications describing his &quot;Planar process&quot;. He presented a novel adaptation of silicon manufacturing processes that had originated at Bell Labs. The planar process created a flat surface structure protected with an insulating silicon dioxide layer. Robert Noyce showed how Hoerni’s planar process could be exploited to electrically interconnect the components of an integrated circuit.

On February 12, 1960, Last, Robert Norman, and Isy Haas reported on the first integrated circuits at the IRE Solid State Conference in a paper entitled &quot;Solid-State Micrologic Elements&quot;. They described hybrid silicon integrated circuits that they had developed, including a flip-flop, a gate, an adder, and a shift register. They also discussed the feasibility of creating miniaturized, integrated logic circuits. However, they still faced many challenges in improving and commercially producing them. By the summer of 1960, Last&#x27;s Fairchild Semiconductor team succeeded in building and demonstrating the first working planar integrated circuits. The working group included Last, Bob Norman, Isy Haas, Lionel Kattner, James Nall, James Wilkerson, Gary Tripp, Robert Marlin, Chester Gunter, Jerry Lessard, and Melvin Hoar.

As of September 1960, Last&#x27;s Micrologic section was pursuing three possible approaches for creating micro-circuitry: Phase I (hybrid circuits), Phase II (physically isolated integrated circuits) and Phase III (diffusion or electrically isolated integrated circuits). The electrically isolated circuits were initially a side project of Haas and Kattner, who worked on the idea in their own time. In September 1960 they reported an important breakthrough. Last believed that their work held great promise. However, outside Last&#x27;s working group, there was considerable resistance to the integrated circuits project at Fairchild. Fairchild&#x27;s marketing VP, Tom Bay, recommended shutting the project down entirely. Fairchild was focused more on the production of diodes and transistors and did not immediately see applications for integrated circuits. As a result, Last chose to leave Fairchild. Lionel Kattner took over the Fairchild transistor project and eventually, with the approval of Gordon Moore, put a family of transistors into production by the end of 1961.

=== Amelco and Teledyne ===
Once again, Last was in the position of resigning from one company so that he could develop new technology in another company. The excitement of discovering and developing something new in an entrepreneurial setting appealed to Last much more than iterative development and production of known technology. On January 31, 1961, Jay Last, Jean Hoerni, Sheldon Roberts, and (briefly) Gene Kleiner of the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; resigned from Fairchild Semiconductor to create Amelco Corporation as a division of Teledyne. They were later joined by Isy Haas.

Henry Earl Singleton and George Kozmetsky formed Teledyne (originally named Instrument Systems) by acquiring smaller companies, with the intention of positioning themselves to create integrated circuits for advanced military systems. Last and Hoerni had technical expertise essential to such an undertaking. By targeting specialty military applications as their primary market, Teledyne avoided putting itself in direct competition with Fairchild, and stayed on generally good terms with the larger company.

From 1961 to 1966 Last served as Director of Research and Development at Amelco. The manufacturing operation, Electron Devices, was established as a subsidiary of Amelco, in Mountain View, California. Last insisted on staying in the area that became Silicon Valley, because it was developing the necessary infrastructure for obtaining materials, equipment and personnel. Again, in choosing to stay in California, Last was a pioneer in creating Silicon Valley.

Many of the products that Teledyne created were classified products for specific military uses, of which little was publicly known. They created circuits used by NASA and military space operations, including products used in the Doppler system for Moon landings.

From 1966 to 1974 Last served as Vice President of Research and Development for Teledyne, moving to Los Angeles, California to work more closely with George Roberts. His role became one of higher level oversight and trouble-shooting, reviewing the technological capabilities and viability of various companies within Teledyne.

=== Recognition ===
In May 2011, the traitorous eight (Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and C. Sheldon Roberts) received the “Legends of California Award” from the California Historical Society. Prior to the award ceremony, Last said he was not scared about his risky departure from Shockley, explaining, &quot;When you are in your late 20s you don&#x27;t know enough to be scared, we just did it. We just knew what we had to do and we did it.&quot;

Last appeared on the PBS documentary series &quot;American Experience&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;, which debuted on February 6, 2013. The show focused on the eight pioneering innovators, including Last, who defected from Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to start Fairchild Semiconductor, and turned Santa Clara County, California, into the center of technological ingenuity. In the program, Last reflected on how, at age 16, between his junior and senior years of high school, he hitchhiked to California and spent the summer picking apricots in Santa Clara Valley. Last also talked about the day that William Shockley showed up in Last&#x27;s laboratory at MIT and offered him a job at his company.

==Art and philanthropy==
The brightly colored fruit-box labels used in southern California interested Last in color lithography. He has become a well-known collector, scholar of the history of lithography, and author.

===Writing and publishing===
Last authored or co-authored a number of art books, including &quot;The Color Explosion: Nineteenth-Century American Lithography&quot; (2005), which won the 2007 Newman Award for the outstanding book of the year dealing with print studies from the American Historical Print Collectors Society. With Gordon McClelland he has co-authored &quot;California Orange Box Labels&quot;, &quot;Fruit Box Labels&quot;, &quot;The California Style&quot;, &quot;California Watercolor Artists 1925–1950&quot;, and &quot;California Watercolors 1850–1970&quot;. From 1982 to 2010, he was president of California-based Hillcrest Press, which publishes fine art books on the history of California art, ethnic art and graphic arts.

===The Archaeological Conservancy===
In 1989, Last founded The Archaeological Conservancy, which has preserved and protected nearly 500 archeological sites in 44 U.S. states. The Conservancy buys sites of archaeological interest through private sale from landowners, to prevent their sale or destruction, and develops conservation plans for their protection. The first protected area was Powers Fort, in southeastern Missouri. Another early acquisition has become Hopewell Culture National Historical Park, part of a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.

=== The Fowler Museum at UCLA ===
Last became interested in Africa and African art after visiting the Museum of Primitive Art in New York in the 1950s. He became a significant collector, specializing in art from West and Central Africa, particularly works of the Lega people of Democratic Republic of the Congo. Beginning in 1973, Last and his wife Deborah have given more than 660 works to the Fowler Museum at UCLA, including a 2013 gift of 92 Lega wood and ivory figures, masks, tools and spoons. He said of his interest in the Lega people and their artwork: 
=== Jay T. Last Collection of Lithographic and Social History ===
Last&#x27;s personal collection of commercial prints and ephemera has been donated to the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, as the &quot;Jay T. Last Collection of Lithographic and Social History&quot;. It contains over 185,000 printed paper artifacts, most of which date to America in the 19th and early 20th century. The collection includes images from over 500 lithographic companies. An important subset of the collection is the &quot;California Citrus Box Labels&quot;, more than 1000 lithographed labels from the California citrus industry in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The labels were produced for wooden crates of oranges, lemons and grapefruits distributed by Southern Californian growers, packers and distributors.

==Awards==
* 1999, Charles Force Hutchison and Marjorie Smith Hutchison Medal, University of Rochester
* 2005, Maurice Rickards Award from the Ephemera Society of America
* 2007, Ewell L. Newman Award from the American Historical Print Collectors Society.
* 2011, Jay Last, with Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and C. Sheldon Roberts, received the “Legends of California Award” from the California Historical Society.
==Death==
Last died in Los Angeles on November 11, 2021, less than a month after his 92nd birthday.

<text>In the Irish Calendar The Old Cows Days/The Days of the Brindled Cow are the last days of March and the first three days of April; in .

The term comes from a folk tale, illustrating the unpredictability of the weather at this time of year in Ireland. The tale relates how the bó riabhach, &quot;the brindled cow&quot;, complained at the beginning of April to her companions in the herd of the terrible harshness of the previous month of March. As the grumbling of the cow continued, the at first uninterested March began to take umbrage and decided to teach the speckled cow a lesson she would never forget. So March &quot;borrowed&quot; the first three days of April but made them so bitterly cold and miserable that before they were ended the unlucky bó riabhach had died. The purported lesson of the &quot;days of the brindled cow&quot; is that complaining about the harshness of the weather is done at one&#x27;s peril.

The same story can be found in different versions all over Ireland and Europe in general.

The brindled cow or the bó riabhach referred to is a once common but now rare native Irish cattle breed.

<text>Matthew Smith (born 1966) is a British video game programmer. He created the games &quot;Manic Miner&quot; and &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; for the ZX Spectrum, released in 1983 and 1984 respectively. Smith left the games industry in 1988 and later moved to the Netherlands. He has since returned to the UK and has worked on some games as well as appearing at conventions and in documentaries.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Penge. His family moved to Wallasey when he was seven years old.

==Programming career==
===1980s===
He started out programming when he received a TRS-80 for Christmas in 1979. His first commercial game was a &quot;Galaxian&quot; clone for the TRS-80 called &quot;Delta Tau One&quot;. He then went on to produce &quot;Monster Muncher&quot; on the VIC-20. Smith has said that he wrote Monster Muncher in 3 hours.

He obtained a ZX Spectrum on loan from Bug-Byte Software Ltd. in return for a freelance contract for three games. The first of these was &quot;Styx&quot; in 1983 for which Matthew received £3,000.

He wrote &quot;Manic Miner&quot; in eight weeks using a Model III Tandy. It was the first ZX Spectrum title with in-game music. The sequel, &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot;, took considerably longer to write. &quot;Manic Miner&quot; and &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; were both commercial successes. Smith has stated that &quot;Manic Miner&quot; was the most enjoyable game to make for him whereas &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; was &#x27;seven shades of hell&#x27;.

After the creation of &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; he started work on &quot;The Mega Tree&quot; (commonly known as Willy Meets The Taxman), for publication by his company Software Projects. Unlike his previous two hits &quot;The Mega Tree&quot; was not developed for the ZX Spectrum but the Commodore 64. The project failed to gain traction and was cancelled three months into development. The development disks containing some of the graphics from the unreleased game were eventually auctioned for charity in 2004.

In 1987 adverts began appearing in games magazines for a new game &quot;Attack of the Mutant Zombie Flesh Eating Chickens From Mars&quot; said to have been programmed by Smith, and due for release by Software Projects. It is reported that Smith was unhappy with the finished product and it was never released.

===Departure===
Smith closed Software Projects in 1988 without completing any more programs. He lived in a Dutch commune from around 1995 but was deported from the Netherlands in October 1997 and returned to Britain, saying that he had failed to keep his residency papers in order. In the late 1990s, he said he was &quot;surprised and flattered&quot; at the amount of attention and speculation he had attracted on the Internet.

===Return to games===
In 1999 Smith returned to the UK video game industry by taking a job at Dewsbury-based computer game developer Runecraft.

In 2000, he appeared on a British television documentary programme called &quot;Thumb Candy&quot; about the history of video games in which, in a brief interview, he discussed &quot;Manic Miner&quot; and his 1980&#x27;s career. He has also attended and given talks at retrogaming conventions during this decade.

In 2013, Smith was working on producing a new game with Elite Systems, who have republished his original games on mobile platforms.

<doc id="562827" wikidata="Q7120001" url="?curid=562827" title="POP-11">
<text>POP-11 is a reflective, incrementally compiled programming language with many of the features of an interpreted language. It is the core language of the Poplog programming environment developed originally by the University of Sussex, and recently in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, which hosts the main Poplog website.

POP-11 is an evolution of the language POP-2, developed in Edinburgh University, and features an open stack model (like Forth, among others). It is mainly procedural, but supports declarative language constructs, including a pattern matcher, and is mostly used for research and teaching in artificial intelligence, although it has features sufficient for many other classes of problems. It is often used to introduce symbolic programming techniques to programmers of more conventional languages like Pascal, who find POP syntax more familiar than that of Lisp. One of POP-11&#x27;s features is that it supports first-class functions.

POP-11 is the core language of the Poplog system. The availability of the compiler and compiler subroutines at run-time (a requirement for incremental compiling) gives it the ability to support a far wider range of extensions (including run-time extensions, such as adding new data-types) than would be possible using only a macro facility. This made it possible for (optional) incremental compilers to be added for Prolog, Common Lisp and Standard ML, which could be added as required to support either mixed language development or development in the second language without using any POP-11 constructs. This made it possible for Poplog to be used by teachers, researchers, and developers who were interested in only one of the languages. The most successful product developed in POP-11 was the Clementine data mining system, developed by ISL. After SPSS bought ISL, they renamed Clementine to &quot;SPSS Modeler&quot; and decided to port it to C++ and Java, and eventually succeeded with great effort, and perhaps some loss of the flexibility provided by the use of an AI language.

POP-11 was for a time available only as part of an expensive commercial package (Poplog), but since about 1999 it has been freely available as part of the open-source software version of Poplog, including various added packages and teaching libraries. An online version of ELIZA using POP-11 is available at Birmingham.

At the University of Sussex, David Young used POP-11 in combination with C and Fortran to develop a suite of teaching and interactive development tools for image processing and vision, and has made them available in the Popvision extension to Poplog.

==Simple code examples==
Here is an example of a simple POP-11 program:

 define Double(Source) -&gt; Result;
 Source*2 -&gt; Result;
 enddefine;

 Double(123) =&gt;

That prints out:
 ** 246

This one includes some list processing:

Examples using the POP-11 pattern matcher, which makes it relatively easy for students to learn to develop sophisticated list-processing programs without having to treat patterns as tree structures accessed by &#x27;head&#x27; and &#x27;tail&#x27; functions (CAR and CDR in Lisp), can be found in the online introductory tutorial. The matcher is at the heart of
the SimAgent (sim_agent) toolkit. Some of the powerful features of the toolkit, such as linking pattern variables to inline code variables, would have been very difficult to implement without the incremental compiler facilities.

<text>The military and political career of [[Simón Bolívar]] (July 24, 1783 – December 17, 1830), which included both formal service in the armies of various revolutionary regimes and actions organized by himself or in collaboration with other exile patriot leaders during the years from 1811 to 1830, was an important element in the success of the independence wars in South America. Given the unstable political climate during these years, Bolívar and other patriot leaders, such as Santiago Mariño, Manuel Piar, José Francisco Bermúdez and Francisco de Paula Santander often had to go into exile in the Caribbean or nearby areas of Spanish America that at the moment were controlled by those favoring independence, and from there, carry on the struggle. These wars resulted in the creation of several South American states out of the former Spanish colonies, the currently existing Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, and the now defunct Gran Colombia.

In his 30-year career, Bolívar faced two main challenges. First was gaining acceptance as undisputed leader of the republican cause. Despite claiming such a role since 1813, he began to achieve this only in 1817, and consolidated his hold on power after his dramatic and unexpected victory in New Granada in 1819. His second challenge was implementing a vision of unifying the region into one large state, which he believed (and most would agree, correctly) would be the only guarantee of maintaining American independence from the Spanish in northern South America. His early experiences under the First Venezuelan Republic and in New Granada convinced him that divisions among republicans, augmented by federal forms of government, only allowed Spanish American royalists to eventually gain the upper hand. Once again, it was his victory in 1819 that gave him the leverage to bring about the creation of a unified state, Gran Colombia, with which to oppose the Spanish Monarchy on the continent.

==Historical background==
The idea of independence for Spanish America had existed for several years among a minority of the residents of northern South America. In 1797 the Venezuelans Manuel Gual and José María España, inspired by exiled Spaniard Juan Bautista Picornell, unsuccessfully attempted to establish a republic in Venezuela with greater social equality for Venezuelans of all racial and social backgrounds. Nine years later, in 1806 long-time Venezuelan expatriate Francisco de Miranda led a small group of mostly British and American foreign volunteers in an attempt to take over Venezuela and set up an independent republic. Like Gual and España&#x27;s conspiracy, Miranda&#x27;s putsch failed to attract Venezuelans of any social and economic class, in fact local Venezuelans organized the resistance to Miranda&#x27;s invasion and quickly dispersed it. The lack of interest on the part of the Venezuelan Criollos is often explained by their fear that the loss of the removal of Spanish control might bring about a revolution that would destroy their own power in Venezuela. Nevertheless, in the decades leading up to 1806, Criollos had often been at odds with the Spanish Crown: they wanted an expansion of the free trade that was benefiting their plantation economy and objected to the Crown&#x27;s new policy of granting social privileges that had been traditionally been reserved for whites (&quot;españoles&quot;) to Pardos through the purchase of certificates of whiteness (&quot;gracias al sacar&quot;). So the Criollos&#x27; failure to support Gual, España and Miranda, which would have created a state under their control, needs to also be understood by the fact that a national identity separate from the Spanish had not yet emerged among them.

In neighboring New Granada tensions also existed with the Crown but had not evolved into an outright desire for separation. In 1779 the Revolt of the Comuneros pitted middle-class and rural residents against the royal authorities over the issue of new taxes instituted as part of the Bourbon Reforms. Although the revolt was stopped and the leaders punished or executed, the uprising did manage to slow down the economic reforms that the Crown had planned for New Granada. In the subsequent decades, a few New Granadans, like Antonio Nariño, became intrigued by the ideas of the French Revolution and attempted to promote its values by disseminating translated documents like the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&quot;. Again, this was a minority and not necessarily a sign that the majority in New Granada did not see themselves as members of the Spanish Monarchy.

The break with the Crown came in 1808 with the disappearance of a stable government in Spain. The crisis was precipitated by Napoleon&#x27;s removal of Bourbon Dynasty from the throne of Spain (he convinced Ferdinand VII to abdicate, and his father Charles IV to renounce any claim to returning to the throne he had abdicated only months earlier) and his invasion of Spain. As the entire Spanish world rejected the new Bonaparte Dynasty (Napoleon gave the crown of Spain to his brother, the King of Naples and Sicily), Spain itself fell into chaos and it took almost a year for a coordinated, centralized provisional government (the Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies) to form. Even then, the rapid and large French advances in the Peninsula seemed to make the idea of a stable government in Spain pointless. By 1810, the Supreme Junta was cornered in the island city of Cadiz during the two-year Siege of Cádiz. Throughout Spanish America, people felt it was time to take the government into their own hands, if a Spanish world, independent of the French, were to continue to exist at all, and therefore in 1810 juntas were set up throughout the Americas, including in Caracas and Bogotá, just as they had been in Spain two years earlier.

==Service under the First Republic (1810-1812)==
In 1809 a twenty-six-year-old Bolívar had retreated to his estate in the Valleys of Aragua, refusing to openly participate in calls for the establishment of a Venezuelan junta, because the plans did not consider the option of independence. He was still in his country estates when a junta was successfully established on April 19, 1810. The new Junta of Caracas chose him to be part of a delegation to the United Kingdom to seek British aid. The delegation did not have much success, but Bolívar did return in December 1810 with Francisco de Miranda, who saw an opportunity in the political turmoil to return to Venezuela.

===Independence declared===
Civil war broke out between the provinces of Venezuela that recognized the Caracas Junta and those that still recognized the Regency in Spain (the Cortes of Cádiz), that had replaced the Supreme Central Junta. The situation became more tense when a congress, called by the Caracas Junta, declared independence on July 5, 1811, sparking rebellions in Valencia in favor of the Cortes of Cádiz. Bolívar&#x27;s first military service was as an officer under Miranda&#x27;s command in the units created to put down this revolt. Bolívar was promoted to colonel and made commandant of Puerto Cabello the following year. At the same time that Frigate Captain Domingo de Monteverde was making fast and vast advances into republican territory from the west (his forces had entered Valencia on May 3, 1812), Bolívar lost control of San Felipe Castle along with its ammunition stores on June 30, when the royalist prisoners held there managed to take it over and attack the small number of troops in the city. Deciding that the situation was lost, Bolívar effectively abandoned his post and retreated to his estate farm in San Mateo. Miranda also saw the republican cause as lost and authorized a capitulation with Monteverde on July 25.

===The royalist restoration===
The terms of the Capitulation of San Mateo, which Monteverde approved but which Miranda never came to sign, granted amnesty and the right to emigrate from Venezuela to all republicans, if they chose to do so. Nevertheless, there was great confusion among the republicans as to what the treaty actually contained or if Monteverde would keep his word. It was in this uncertain environment that Miranda chose to abandon the country before Monteverde occupied Caracas. In the early morning of August 1, Miranda was sleeping in the house of the commandant of La Guaira, Colonel Manuel María Casas, when he was awakened by Casas, Bolívar, Miguel Peña and four other soldiers, who promptly arrested Miranda for treason to the Republic and turned him over to Monteverde. For his apparent services to the royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bolívar a passport, and Bolívar left for Curaçao on August 27.

==Exile and the Second Republic (1812-1814)==
In Curaçao Bolívar learned that Monteverde had broken the promises given in the Capitulation of San Mateo. Many of the republicans who had stayed behind were arrested and the property of many republicans, both in Venezuela and in exile, were confiscated to make up for the large deficits the government faced. Bolívar decided to rejoin the patriot cause and made his way to Cartagena de Indias, which had established itself as an independent republic on November 11, 1811 (in reaction as much to events in Spain as to attempts by the junta in Bogotá to control it) and joined a few days later in a confederation with four other provinces, the United Provinces of New Granada. In the weeks before arriving in Cartagena in October 1812, Bolívar began to analyze the collapse of the Venezuelan republic and published his thoughts in December in his Cartagena Manifesto. In the document Bolívar blamed the failure on the federal nature of the Venezuelan republic, which had allowed provinces to ignore the needs of other provinces threatened by Monteverde&#x27;s advance, and the intransigence of the Venezuelan population to the republican cause, among other things. He saw the Venezuelan case as a warning to the divided New Granada and urged it to retake Caracas from the royalists. He enlisted as an officer in the army of the New Granadan Union and led forces in the Magdalena Campaign against cities in the lower Magdalena River that had refused to accept Cartagena&#x27;s authority or that of the Union, and then attacked Ocaña. His success in these operations convinced the congress of the Union to authorize his plans to invade Venezuela in May 1813, and thus began his Admirable Campaign.

His reentry into Venezuela marked a new, more violent phase of the wars of independence. Monteverde&#x27;s troops had already carried out atrocities: he had allowed his soldiers to loot many of the cities he occupied and several of his commanders became notorious for torturing and killing civilians suspected of collaborating with the Republic. Bolívar also faced the fact that by 1813 much of the older aristocrats, who had led the republic, had abandoned the cause of independence, and the general population had turned against republicanism even before its collapse. In order to drive a wedge between Venezuelans and Peninsulares, Bolívar&#x27;s instituted a policy of no quarter in his Decree of War to the Death, in which he promised to kill any Peninsular who did not actively support his efforts to restore independence and to spare any American even if they actively collaborated with Monteverde or the royalists.

===The Republic restored and lost===

Bolívar&#x27;s push towards Caracas was aided by the fact that the general population, which had welcomed Monteverde a year earlier, had become disillusioned by his failure to implement the terms of the San Mateo Capitulation or the Spanish Constitution of 1812, which the capitulation promised. Monteverde also faced attacks on two fronts, since Santiago Mariño had already opened a front on the east in January 1813. Bolívar&#x27;s forces easily defeated the overtaxed and underpaid royalist army in a series of battles, entered Caracas on August 6, 1813, and laid siege to Monteverde, who had retreated to Puerto Cabello. In Caracas Bolívar announced the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic, but placed himself at the head of a military government, since the situation did not allow for the restoration of the old authorities or new elections. Bolívar would base his subsequent and enduring claim to be the sole head of the Venezuelan republic and commander-in-chief of its forces on this accomplishment, although even at this time he was not universally acknowledged as head of the state or the republican forces. Mariño, based in Cumaná, did not recognize Bolívar&#x27;s claim, but did collaborate with him militarily. Reprisals were carried out against Peninsular royalists that were captured. It was during this period that the republican city fathers of Caracas, following the example of Mérida, granted Bolívar the title of Liberator and office of captain general in the Church of San Francisco (the more appropriate site, the Cathedral of Caracas, was still damaged from the 1812 earthquake).

Bolívar and Mariño&#x27;s success, like Monteverde&#x27;s a year earlier, was short-lived. The new Republic failed to convince the common people that it was not a tool of the urban elite. Lower-class people, especially the southern, rural &quot;llaneros&quot; (cowboys), flocked to the royalist cause. &quot;Llaneros&quot; played a key military role in the region&#x27;s struggle. Turning the tide against independence, these highly mobile, ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed Bolívar out of his home country once more. By 1814, the regular royalist army headed by Governor and Captain General Juan Manuel Cajigal was overshadowed by a large, irregular force of &quot;llaneros&quot; recruited and led by José Tomás Boves. With the royalist irregulars displaying the same passion and violence that Bolívar had demonstrated in his &quot;war to the death&quot; decree, the republicans suffered their first major setback at the Battle of La Puerta on June 15, 1814, and Boves took Caracas on July 16. The republicans and Criollo royalists in Caracas, who also feared Boves&#x27;s &quot;llanero&quot; hoards, had to flee en masse to Mariño&#x27;s strongholds in the east. The combined forces of Mariño&#x27;s and Bolívar were defeated again at the Battle of Aragua de Barcelona on August 18, at a cost of 2,000 royalist casualties of the 10,000 troops they fielded, most of the 3,000 combatants in the republican army, in addition to many civilian casualties. Due to their series of repeated reverses both Bolívar and Mariño were arrested and removed from power by José Félix Ribas and Manuel Piar, each representing the two republican commands then in place in Venezuela. A few days later Ribas and Piar decided not to try them and instead released them into exile. On September 8, Bolívar and Mariño set sail for Cartagena de Indias, leaving Piar and Ribas to lead the increasingly encircled republicans.

===Royalist control consolidated===

Earlier in March 1814, Ferdinand VII had returned to the throne. The Sixth Coalition&#x27;s advances made it impossible for Napoleon to continue holding Ferdinand or fighting in Spain. Once in Spain, however, Ferdinand was not pleased by the revolution in government that had been undertaken in his name, and by May he had abolished the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and began persecuting and arresting the liberals responsible for its creation. To deal with the Americas, Ferdinand organized the largest expeditionary force that Spain ever sent to the Americas up to that time. Colonel Pablo Morillo, a veteran of the Spanish struggle against the French was chosen as its commander. The expeditionary force was made up of approximately 10,000 men and nearly sixty ships. Originally, they were to head for Montevideo in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, another region that had fallen out of royalist control, but soon it was decided to send these forces to the Venezuela and New Granada, where the war had become exceedingly savage. Realizing that this change in plans would not go over well with the soldiers, the news was kept from them until they were at sea. When the expeditionary force arrived in Venezuela, it found that most of it had been restored to royalist control, save for Margarita Island, which surrendered to it with no blood shed. With Venezuela pacified, plans were quickly made to subdue neighboring New Granada, and the bulk of the troops moved to the coastal city of Santa Marta, which had remained in royalist hands since 1810.

==Second exile in New Granada and the Caribbean (1814-1816)==
Like many other Venezuelan republicans who fled to New Granada after the second wave of royalist victories, Bolívar once again entered into the service of the United Provinces and fought against cities that had refused to acknowledge its authority. His forces took Bogotá on December 12, 1814, after an eight-month-long war, and was promoted to captain general for his efforts. He was then given the task of capturing the royalist stronghold, Santa Marta, but Cartagena, the obvious base from which to launch this offensive, refused to give him the necessary soldiers and supplies, so infighting broke out. As Santa Martan forces gained ground against the divided republicans in northern New Granada, Bolívar left for Jamaica on May 8, 1815. Cartagena would fall to Morillo in December 1815 and Bogotá in May of the following year.

===Aid from the Haitian Republic and Curaçao===

Now thirty-two years of age, he found himself in exile for the second time. In Jamaica, Bolívar once again issued a manifesto explaining his view of the failure of the republican cause in Venezuela. His famous Letter from Jamaica, though ostensibly written to one man, was an appeal to Great Britain specifically and the European powers in general to aid the cause of Spanish American independence, but it found no significant response. So he turned to the small and isolated republic of Haiti, that had freed itself from French rule, but being composed of mostly former slaves, received little aid from either the United States or Europe. Bolívar and other Venezuelan and New Granadan exiles were warmly received by the Haitian president Alexandre Pétion. The growing exile community would receive money, volunteers and weapons from the Haitian president enabling them to resume plans to continue the struggle for independence. There was debate, however, over who should be in charge, but his ability to win over Pétion and a Curaçaoan sea merchant, Luis Brión (he is traditionally referred to by the Spanish form of his name), who had just acquired a much-needed warship in England to aid the embattled Cartagenan Republic, forced the other Venezuelan leaders to grudgingly accept his leadership. Pétion, for his part, convinced Bolívar to expand the fight for independence to include the liberation of slaves.

The émigrés successfully captured a beachhead at Los Cayos on March 31, 1816. Bolívar proclaimed the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic and in two decrees of June 2 and July 16 declared the freedom of slaves conditional on their joining the republican forces. Shortly thereafter, Margarita Island, safely separated by water from Morillo&#x27;s forces, rejoined the republican cause and became a second base of operations. Operating under the command of Mariño, Piar and Carlos Soublette the republican expeditionaries captured more coastal towns. On July 14 Bolívar led an assault against Ocumare de la Costa, which ended in a debacle in which Bolívar abandoned Mariño, Piar and the rest of his forces, and fled by sea. Piar&#x27;s forces managed to fight their way from the Caribbean coast to the southern Llanos, where the vast and underpopulated terrain and the forces forming under José Antonio Páez protected them from the royalist army. Mariño retreated to his home province of Cumaná, where he could rely on personal connections to maintain a base of operations. After failing to find support along the coast, Bolívar returned to Haiti. In the intervening months the divided republican leaders unable to agree on a single leader, decided to compromise and in October offered Bolívar the military command, with the understanding that a separate civilian government would be formed. In Haiti Bolívar gathered new supplies and organized a second expedition, named by history as the Jacmel Expedition for the city from which it departed, and on December 31, 1816, landed in Barcelona controlled by Mariño, who by this point barely accepted Bolívar as head of the republicans.

==The Third Republic (1817-1820)==

Bolívar took the forces he brought from Haiti to the Orinoco region, which was mostly controlled by Piar. Piar was making headway against the royalists of Angostura, and was preparing to lay siege to the city. The siege proved difficult and long, since Angostura had a lifeline in the river itself. Bolívar&#x27;s reinforcements were useful and the city fell in August 1817. Angostura proved to be an immensely valuable base. From it the republicans had access to foreign trade in Caribbean and beyond via the Orinoco. The river&#x27;s tributaries also provided access to the Venezuelan and New Granadan Llanos to the west, especially those in Casanare, where refugees from Morillo&#x27;s troops had organized themselves under Francisco de Paula Santander. In Angostura Bolívar began publishing the &quot;Correo del Orinoco&quot; newspaper, an official organ of the revolutionaries, which was circulated not only in Venezuela, but in the Caribbean and in Europe. Under Páez and Piar, the republican armies had begun to recruit the local &quot;llaneros&quot; who, after Morillo disbanded Boves&#x27;s informal units, no longer had an outlet for quick enrichment and social advancement under the royalist banner. This, however, posed the challenge to the Criollo republican leaders of channeling the &quot;llanero&#x27;s&quot; energy, while not re-igniting the race war that had occurred under Boves. In this environment leaders like Piar, who in recent years had begun to emphasize his Pardo roots as he built a Pardo and &quot;llanero&quot; following, became suspect, and this weakness proved useful to Bolívar, when the moment came to reassert his position as head of the nascent republic.

===Challenges to Bolívar&#x27;s authority===
The first overt challenge to his rule came with the meeting of the &quot;Congresillo of Cariaco&quot; on May 8 and 9 under the auspices of Canon José Cortés de Madariaga—who had been a member of the Junta of Caracas and had just returned to Venezuela after being imprisoned in Spain—Luis Brión and Santiago Mariño. The eight-member Congress proposed to restore the 1811 Constitution and establish a permanent government that could negotiate a recognition by other nations. Mariño offered his and Bolívar&#x27;s resignation in order to allow the Congress to elect a new executive. The Congress restored the triumvirate and selected Fernando Rodríguez del Toro (who was at the moment exiled in Trinidad), Francisco Javier Mayz (one of the eight deputies of the Congress) and Simón Bolívar as the new triumvirate. To replace in an interim manner the two who were not present, the Congress chose Francisco Antonio Zea and Canon Cortés de Madariaga. It made Mariño general-in-chief of the republican forces and established La Asunción as the temporary capital of the Republic. It sent word to Bolívar to present himself as soon as military conditions permitted to take his place in the triumvirate. Less than a month later, Rafael Urdaneta and Antonio José de Sucre, who remained loyal to Bolívar, lead a group of officers that forced the triumvirate to dissolve itself. By June, Bolívar, aware of its rise and fall, compared its existence to &quot;cassava bread in hot soup&quot; and noted that at the moment in Venezuela only those who could command by force could truly do so.

It was clear to Bolívar by mid-1817 that he need to set a clear example that he would not tolerate challenges to his leadership. After the fall of Angostura Piar had become upset at Bolívar&#x27;s leadership and decided to leave the area. He requested a passport from Bolívar, which he granted. Piar had begun to leave the area, when Bolívar changed his mind and accused Piar of plotting to kill all whites in the area and setting up a black and Mulatto republic (a &quot;pardocracia&quot;) in imitation of Haiti. Piar was tracked down, court-martialed and found guilty. On October 16 he was executed. Although Piar&#x27;s crime had ostensibly been fomenting racial hatred, it was understood that his true crime had been not recognizing Bolívar authority. After Piar&#x27;s execution, Mariño, whom Bolívar&#x27;s confidant and chronicler Daniel Florencio O&#x27;Leary later admitted had been more guilty of insubordination than Piar, fell in line and dropped any other pretensions to an independent leadership.

His political position secured, Bolívar began to expand the scope of his military activity. He met with Páez for the first time in January 1818, who accepted Bolívar as head of the republicans. Páez, however, refused to take his powerful &quot;llanero&quot; cavalry outside of the Llanos, where they were extremely effective in holding off and defeating Morillo&#x27;s formal army. Bolívar was, therefore, left alone in a mid-year attempt to take Caracas, which failed. Nevertheless, by the end of the year, the republicans were secure enough in southern Venezuela, that Bolívar felt it was time to convene a new Venezuelan congress to give the republican government a permanent form. Elections were held in republican areas and to pick representatives of the provinces of Venezuela and New Granada under royalist control, among the troops of those areas. The Congress of Angostura, consisting of twenty-six delegates, began holding sessions in February 1819. The highlight of the opening session was Bolívar&#x27;s &quot;Address at the Congress of Angostura&quot;, now seen along with his &quot;Cartagena Manifesto&quot; and &quot;Jamaica Letter&quot; as a foundational exposition of his political thought. The same day the Congress elected Bolívar president of the Republic and ratified his command of its armies.

===The New Granada Campaign===

After the opening of the Congress, Bolívar conceived of a daring, yet risky, plan of attacking New Granada which had been a Spanish stronghold for the past three years. If he could liberate New Granada he would have a whole new base from which to operate against Morillo. Central New Granada held great promise since, unlike Venezuela, it had only been recently conquered by Morillo and it had a prior six-year experience of independent government. Royalist sentiment was not strong. But it would be hard to take the initiative against the better prepared and supplied royalist army. To surprise it, Bolívar decided to move during the Venezuelan &quot;invierno&quot;, the rainy season, when the Llanos flooded up to a meter and the campaign season ended. Morillo&#x27;s forces would be evacuated from the Llanos for months and no one would anticipate that Bolívar&#x27;s troops would be on the move. This decision, however, would mean literally wading in waist-deep, malarial water for days before attempting to scale the Andes. Understandably the plan received little support from the Congress or even from the master of the Llanos himself, Páez. With only the forces he and Santander had recruited in the Apure and Meta River regions, Bolívar set off in June 1819.
The small army consisted of about 2,500 men: 1,300 infantry and 800 cavalry, including a British legion. It took a route that went from the hot and humid, flood-swept plains of Colombia to the icy mountain pass of the Páramo de Pisba, at an altitude of 3,960 meters (13,000 feet), through the Cordillera Oriental. After the hardships of wading through a virtual sea, the mostly &quot;llanero&quot; army scaled the mountains poorly clothed and ill-prepared for the cold and altitude of the mountains. On both legs of the trip many became ill or died. Despite some intelligence that Bolívar was on the move, the Spanish considered the route impassable, and therefore, they were taken by surprise when Bolívar&#x27;s small army emerged from the mountains on July 5. In a series of battles under the auspices of Francisco Mariño y Soler the republican army cleared its way to Bogotá. First at the Battle of Vargas Swamp on July 25, Bolívar intercepted a royalist force attempting to reach the poorly defended capital. Then at the Battle of Boyacá on August 7, the bulk of the royalist army surrendered to Bolívar. On receiving the news, the viceroy, Juan José de Sámano, and the rest of royalist government fled the capital so fast that they left behind the treasury, an incredible coup for Bolívar and Santander. On August 10 Bolívar&#x27;s army entered Bogotá.

With New Granada secure under Santander&#x27;s control, Bolívar could return to Venezuela in a position of unprecedented military, political and financial strength. In his absence the Congress had flirted with deposing him, assuming that he would meet his death in New Granada. The vice-president Francisco Antonio Zea was deposed and replaced by Juan Bautista Arismendi. All this was quickly reversed when word got to the Congress of Bolívar&#x27;s success. By year&#x27;s end Bolívar presented himself before the Congress and asked it to decree the union of Venezuela and New Granada in a new state, Colombia. It did so on December 17 and elected him president of the new country. The Constitution that the Congress had just written for Venezuela became null and void and a new congress was set to convene within two years.

==President and Commander-in-Chief of Gran Colombia (1820-1825)==
1820 proved to be a banner year for Bolívar. His dream of creating a new nation was becoming a reality. Morillo no longer had the upper hand militarily and by late March reports began to arrive about the success of the Riego Revolt. The revolt meant that the reinforcements that Morillo&#x27;s expeditionary force desperately needed would not be coming. Moreover, in June the official orders to reinstate the Cádiz Constitution arrived and were implemented. The new Constitutional government in Spain radically changed policy towards the rebellions in America. It assumed that the revolutionaries, as liberals, were either fighting for, or could be co-opted by, the Spanish Constitution. Although this might have been true in parts of Spanish America at the start of the decade, by 1820 most Spanish Americans did not trust Fernando VII to keep his oath to the Constitution for long. More importantly, it had always been Bolívar&#x27;s stance that the wars were between two sovereign states, and therefore, the question of reconciling with the Spanish Monarchy under the 1812 Constitution was never a consideration.

Despite this, Morillo continued with negotiations and focused on getting a ceasefire and bringing the war in line with the law of nations. This was achieved in two treaties signed on November 25 and 26 in Santa Ana de Trujillo, which established a six-month cessation of hostilities and regularized the rules of engagement. The negotiations were also important because the Spanish government for the first time tacitly granted Colombia national status, rather than seeing its representatives as mere rebels. Spain did not of course recognize Colombia, but the negotiations papers referred to it as such, rather than with the previous denominations of &quot;Bolívar&#x27;s forces&quot; or &quot;the Congress at Angostura.&quot; The ceasefire allowed Bolívar to build up his army for the final showdown everyone knew was coming. By the end of the year, the Constitutional government granted Morillo his long-standing request to resign and he left South America. He was replaced by Miguel de la Torre.

===Victory in Venezuela===

The truce did not last all six months. On January 28 the &quot;cabildo&quot; of Maracaibo, which had been in secret negotiations with the republicans aided by native son Rafael Urdaneta, declared the province an independent republic, which chose to join Colombia. La Torre took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed, when Bolívar returned to Venezuela in April 1821, leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela, save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Hostilities continued until the surrender of Puerto Cabello in 1823, but the main front of the war now moved to southern New Granada and Quito.

===The Southern Campaign, Quito and Peru (1821-1824)===

With the Spanish Monarchy collapsing in South America and the uncertainty of constitutional rule in Spain, provinces of the Presidency of Quito began to declare independence. In October 1820 a coup in Guayaquil set up a junta, which declared Guayaquil a republic. Portoviejo and Cuenca followed suit in the next few weeks. Quito remained in royalist control under the Audiencia President, Field Marshal Melchior Aymerich, and by January 1821 had defeated the forces sent by Guayaquil against it. Bolívar was determined to ensure that the Presidency of Quito become part of Gran Colombia and not remain a collection of small, divided republics. To this end, Colombian aid in the form of supplies and an army under Antonio José de Sucre began to arrive in Guayaquil in February. Throughout 1821 Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides were exhausted and signed a 90-day armistice. The following year, at Battle of Pichincha on May 24, 1822, Sucre&#x27;s Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito. The territory of New Granada was secure. From Puerto Cabello royalist make a counterattack at Battle of Lake Maracaibo. However the main focus now became neutralizing the royalist Army in Peru.

José de San Martín had already made incursions into Peru starting in 1820. He had been declared Protector of Peruvian Freedom, in August 1821 after liberating parts of the country, but the important cities and provinces still remained royalist. Bolívar and San Martín held a meeting in Guayaquil on July 26 and 27, 1822, in which they discussed plans to liberate Peru and it was decided that Bolívar and Gran Colombia would take over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Martín departed from the scene. For the next two years Colombian and Peruvian patriot forces gain more territory. On February 10, 1824, Bolívar was given immense political powers when a Peruvian congress named him dictator of Peru, which made Bolívar the head of state of a second country and allowed Bolívar to completely reorganize the political and military administration of Peru. Bolívar, assisted by Sucre, decisively defeated the remnants of the royalist cavalry on August 6, 1824, at the Battle of Junín. Sucre then destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the royalist army at Battle of Ayacucho on December 9. South American independence was now all but secured. The only royalist area in the continent was highland country of Upper Peru, El Callao and Chiloé.

===The Peruvian and Colombian campaign in Upper Peru===
&quot;For details, see Bolivian War of Independence&quot;

Bolívar was now president of both Gran Colombia and Peru and had been granted extraordinary powers by the legislatures of both countries to carry out the war against the Spanish Monarchy. Since Bolívar was tied up with the administration of Quito and Peru, the liberation of Upper Peru fell to Sucre and O&#x27;Connor, and within a year in April 1825, the task had been completed. A congress of Upper Peru on August 6, 1825, chose to name the new nation after the Liberator and called it the Republic of Bolívar. (The name would later be changed to Bolivia.) With independence secured for all of Spanish South America, Bolívar&#x27;s political life entered a new phase. He now had to turn to consolidating the large nations he had created out of the former Spanish provinces. And dissension began to brew in the north as the regions of Gran Colombia began to chafe under the centralized government.

==The dissolution of Gran Colombia and aftermath==
During 1826, internal divisions had sparked dissent throughout the nation and regional uprisings erupted in Venezuela, and Gran Colombia appeared to be on the verge of collapse. An amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the Venezuelan rebels, but political dissent appeared in New Granada as a consequence of this. In an attempt to keep the nation together, Bolívar called for a constitutional convention at Ocaña to be held in April 1828. To prevent the splintering of Gran Colombia, Bolívar proposed to introduce an even more centralist model of government, including some or all of the elements he had been able to place in the Bolivian constitution: a lifetime presidency with the ability to select a successor, and a hereditary third chamber of the legislature. These proposals were deemed anti-liberal and met with strong opposition, including from a faction forming around Santander, who by now was openly opposed to Bolívar politically.

The Convention of Ocaña (April 9 to June 10, 1828) met under a cloud. Many felt that the breakup of the country was imminent. Addressing these fears, the Congress went in the opposite direction that Bolívar had hoped, and drafted a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government with greatly reduced the powers for the central administration. Unhappy with this outcome, pro-Bolívar delegates left the convention and the constitution was never ratified.

After the failure of the convention, Bolívar proclaimed himself dictator on August 27, 1828, through an Organic Decree of Dictatorship. He considered this as a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, though it only increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents. On September 25, 1828 an attempt to assassinate Bolívar failed, but it illustrated the tense political atmosphere in Gran Colombia. Although Bolívar emerged physically intact from the event, he was, nevertheless, greatly affected. Dissent continued, and new uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela and Quito during the next two years. Gran Colombia finally collapsed in 1830. Bolívar himself died in the same year at age 47 on December 17. His closest political ally at the time, Sucre, who was intending to retire from public life, had been murdered earlier on June 4, 1830.

Bolívar&#x27;s legacy continued in the successor states to Gran Colombia. Many of the officers who had fought by him were not only involved in the revolts that led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia, but continued to play important political and military roles in the decades and wars that followed. Bolívar&#x27;s political thought—his emphasis on a strong, centralized government—became the basis of conservative thought in nineteenth-century South America.

<text>An antifreeze is an additive which lowers the freezing point of a water-based liquid. An antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing-point depression for cold environments. Common antifreezes also increase the boiling point of the liquid, allowing higher coolant temperature. However, all common antifreeze additives also have lower heat capacities than water, and do reduce water&#x27;s ability to act as a coolant when added to it.

Because water has good properties as a coolant, water plus antifreeze is used in internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications, such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters. The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes. Commercially, both the &quot;additive&quot; (pure concentrate) and the &quot;mixture&quot; (diluted solution) are called antifreeze, depending on the context. Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase, which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers. Most if not all commercial antifreeze formulations intended for use in heat transfer applications include anti-corrosion and anti-cavitation agents (that protect the hydraulic circuit from progressive wear).

==Principles and history==
Water was the original coolant for internal combustion engines. It is cheap, nontoxic, and has a high heat capacity. It however has only a 100 Kelvin liquid range, and it expands upon freezing. To address these problems, alternative coolants with improved properties were developed.
Freezing and boiling points are colligative properties of a solution, which depend on the concentration of dissolved substances. Salts lower the melting points of aqueous solutions. Salts are frequently used for de-icing, but salt solutions are not used for cooling systems because they induce corrosion of metals. Low molecular weight organic compounds tend to have melting points lower than water, which makes them suitable for use as antifreeze agents. Solutions of organic compounds, especially alcohols, in water are effective. Alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, etc. have been the basis of all antifreezes since they were commercialized in the 1920s.

==Use and occurrence==

===Automotive and internal combustion engine use===
Most automotive engines are &quot;water&quot;-cooled to remove waste heat, though the &quot;water&quot; used is actually a mixture of water and antifreeze. The term engine coolant is widely used in the automotive industry, which covers its primary function of convective heat transfer for internal combustion engines. When used in an automotive context, corrosion inhibitors are added to help protect vehicles&#x27; radiators, which often contain a range of electrochemically incompatible metals (aluminum, cast iron, copper, brass, solder, etc.). Water pump seal lubricant is also added.

Antifreeze was developed to overcome the shortcomings of water as a heat transfer fluid.

On the other hand, if the engine coolant gets too hot, it might boil while inside the engine, causing voids (pockets of steam), leading to localized hot spots and the catastrophic failure of the engine. If plain water were to be used as an engine coolant in northern climates freezing would occur, causing significant internal engine damage. Also, plain water would increase the prevalence of galvanic corrosion. Proper engine coolant and a pressurized coolant system obviate these shortcomings of water. With proper antifreeze, a wide temperature range can be tolerated by the engine coolant, such as to for 50% (by volume) propylene glycol diluted with distilled water and a 15 psi pressurized coolant system.

Early engine coolant antifreeze was methanol (methyl alcohol). Ethylene glycol was developed because its higher boiling point was more compatible with heating systems.

=== Engine coolant standards ===
The Volkswagen Group has been particularly committed to the development of coolants and their standards (VW TL 774 ) in collaboration with Haertol Chemie from Magdeburg. VW standards include: G11, G12, G12+, G12++, G13 and G12evo.

Another company involved in the development is BASF (Glysantin), whose standards are: G30, G40, G48, G05, G33, and G34.

Volkswagen Group:

* G11: VW TL 774 C
* G12 / G12+: VW TL 774 D/F
* G12++: VW TL 774 G
* G13: VW TL 774 J
* G12evo: VW TL 774 L

BASF:

* Glysantin G48: matches VW TL 774-C
* Glysantin G30: matches VW TL 774-D/F
* Glysantin G40: matches VW TL 774-G and VW TL 774-J
* Glysantin G64: matches VW TL 774-L

===Other industrial uses===
The most common water-based antifreeze solutions used in electronics cooling are mixtures of water and either ethylene glycol (EGW) or propylene glycol (PGW). The use of ethylene glycol has a longer history, especially in the automotive industry. However, EGW solutions formulated for the automotive industry often have silicate based rust inhibitors that can coat and/or clog heat exchanger surfaces. Ethylene glycol is listed as a toxic chemical requiring care in handling and disposal.

Ethylene glycol has desirable thermal properties, including a high boiling point, low freezing point, stability over a wide range of temperatures, and high specific heat and thermal conductivity. It also has a low viscosity and, therefore, reduced pumping requirements. Although EGW has more desirable physical properties than PGW, the latter coolant is used in applications where toxicity might be a concern. PGW is generally recognized as safe for use in food or food processing applications, and can also be used in enclosed spaces.

Similar mixtures are commonly used in HVAC and industrial heating or cooling systems as a high-capacity heat transfer medium. Many formulations have corrosion inhibitors, and it is expected that these chemicals will be replenished (manually or under automatic control) to keep expensive piping and equipment from corroding.

===Biological antifreezes===
Antifreeze proteins refer to chemical compounds produced by certain animals, plants, and other organisms that prevent the formation of ice. In this way, these compounds allow their host organism to operate at temperatures well below the freezing point of water. Antifreeze proteins bind to small ice crystals to inhibit growth and recrystallization of ice that would otherwise be fatal.

Cryoprotectants are commonly used in cryobiology to prevent or inhibit freezing in sperm, blood, stem cells, plant seeds, etc. Ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and glycerol (all used in automotive antifreeze) are commonly used as biological cryoprotectants.

==Primary agents==

===Ethylene glycol===
Most antifreeze is made by mixing distilled water with additives and a base product, usually MEG (mono ethylene glycol) or MPG (mono propylene glycol). Ethylene glycol solutions first became available in 1926 and were marketed as &quot;permanent antifreeze&quot; since the higher boiling points provided advantages for summertime use as well as during cold weather. They are used today for a variety of applications, including automobiles, but there are lower-toxicity alternatives made with propylene glycol available.

When ethylene glycol is used in a system, it may become oxidized to five organic acids (formic, oxalic, glycolic, glyoxalic and acetic acid). Inhibited ethylene glycol antifreeze mixes are available, with additives that buffer the pH and preserve alkalinity of the solution to prevent oxidation of ethylene glycol and formation of these acids. Nitrites, silicates, borates and azoles may also be used to prevent corrosive attack on metal.

Ethylene glycol has a bitter, sweet taste and causes inebriation. The toxic effects of ingesting ethylene glycol occur because it is converted by the liver into 4 other chemicals that are much more toxic. The lethal dose of pure ethylene glycol is 1.4 ml/kg ( is lethal to a person) but is much less lethal if treated within an hour. (see Ethylene glycol poisoning).

===Propylene glycol===
Propylene glycol is considerably less toxic than ethylene glycol and may be labeled as &quot;non-toxic antifreeze&quot;. It is used as antifreeze where ethylene glycol would be inappropriate, such as in food-processing systems or in water pipes in homes where incidental ingestion may be possible. For example, the U.S. FDA allows propylene glycol to be added to a large number of ultra-processed foods, including ice cream, frozen custard, salad dressings, and baked goods, and it is commonly used as the main ingredient in the &quot;e-liquid&quot; used in electronic cigarettes.
Propylene glycol oxidizes to lactic acid.

Besides cooling system corrosion, biological fouling also occurs. Once bacterial slime starts to grow, the corrosion rate of the system increases. Maintenance of systems using glycol solution includes regular monitoring of freeze protection, pH, specific gravity, inhibitor level, color, and biological contamination.

Propylene glycol should be replaced when it turns a reddish color. When an aqueous solution of propylene glycol in a cooling or heating system develops a reddish or black color, this indicates that iron in the system is corroding significantly. In the absence of inhibitors, propylene glycol can react with oxygen and metal ions, generating various compounds including organic acids (e.g., formic, oxalic, acetic). These acids accelerate the corrosion of metals in the system.

===Other antifreezes===
Propylene glycol methyl ether is used as an antifreeze in diesel engines. It is more volatile than glycol.

Once used for automotive antifreeze, glycerol has the advantage of being non-toxic, withstands relatively high temperatures, and is noncorrosive. It is not however used widely.
Glycerol was historically used as an antifreeze for automotive applications before being replaced by ethylene glycol. Volkswagen introduced &quot;G13&quot; (TL 774-G) antifreezes containing glycerol in 2008, marketed as better for the environment due to its low toxicity and reduced emissions. However, since 2018, they have moved on to &quot;G12EVO&quot; (TL 774-L) which no longer contains glycerol.

Glycerol is mandated for use as an antifreeze in many sprinkler systems.

==Measuring the freeze point==

Once antifreeze has been mixed with water and put into use, it periodically needs to be maintained. If engine coolant leaks, boils, or if the cooling system needs to be drained and refilled, the antifreeze&#x27;s freeze protection will need to be considered. In other cases a vehicle may need to be operated in a colder environment, requiring more antifreeze and less water. Three methods are commonly employed to determine the freeze point of the solution by measuring the concentration:

# Specific gravity—(using a hydrometer test strip or some sort of floating indicator),
# Refractometer—which measures the refractive index of the antifreeze solution, and
# Test strips—specialized, disposable indicators made for this purpose.

Both specific gravity and refractive index are affected by temperature, although the former is affected much less catastrophically. Temperature compensation is nevertheless recommended for RI measurement. Propylene glycol solutions cannot be tested using specific gravity because of ambiguous results (40% and 100% solutions have the same specific gravity), although typical uses rarely exceed 60% concentration.

The boiling point can be similarly determined by a concentration given from one of the three methods. Datasheets for glycol/water coolant mixtures are commonly available from chemical vendors.

==Corrosion inhibitors==
Most commercial antifreeze formulations include corrosion inhibiting compounds, and a colored dye (commonly a fluorescent green, red, orange, yellow, or blue) to aid in identification. A 1:1 dilution with water is usually used, resulting in a freezing point of about , depending on the formulation. In warmer or colder areas, weaker or stronger dilutions are used, respectively, but a range of 40%/60% to 60%/40% is frequently specified to ensure corrosion protection, and 70%/30% for maximum freeze prevention down to .

===Maintenance===
In the absence of leaks, antifreeze chemicals such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol may retain their basic properties indefinitely. By contrast, corrosion inhibitors are gradually used up, and must be replenished from time to time. Larger systems (such as HVAC systems) are often monitored by specialist firms which take responsibility for adding corrosion inhibitors and regulating coolant composition. For simplicity, most automotive manufacturers recommend periodic complete replacement of engine coolant, to simultaneously renew corrosion inhibitors and remove accumulated contaminants.

===Traditional inhibitors===
Traditionally, there were two major corrosion inhibitors used in vehicles: silicates and phosphates. American-made vehicles traditionally used both silicates and phosphates. European makes contain silicates and other inhibitors, but no phosphates. Japanese makes traditionally use phosphates and other inhibitors, but no silicates.

===Organic acid technology===
Most modern cars are built with organic acid technology (OAT) antifreeze (e.g., DEX-COOL), or with a hybrid organic acid technology (HOAT) formulation (e.g., Zerex G-05), both of which are claimed to have an extended service life of five years or .

DEX-COOL specifically has caused controversy. Litigation has linked it with intake manifold gasket failures in General Motors&#x27; (GM&#x27;s) 3.1L and 3.4L engines, and with other failures in 3.8L and 4.3L engines. One of the anti-corrosion components presented as sodium or potassium 2-ethylhexanoate and ethylhexanoic acid is incompatible with nylon 6,6 and silicone rubber, and is a known plasticizer. Class action lawsuits were registered in several states of the US, and in Canada, to address some of these claims. The first of these to reach a decision was in Missouri, where a settlement was announced early in December 2007. Late in March 2008, GM agreed to compensate complainants in the remaining 49 states. GM (Motors Liquidation Company) filed for bankruptcy in 2009, which tied up the outstanding claims until a court determines who gets paid.

According to the DEX-COOL manufacturer, &quot;mixing a &#x27;green&#x27; [non-OAT] coolant with DEX-COOL reduces the batch&#x27;s change interval to 2 years or 30,000 miles, but will otherwise cause no damage to the engine&quot;. DEX-COOL antifreeze uses two inhibitors: sebacate and 2-EHA (2-ethylhexanoic acid), the latter which works well with the hard water found in the United States, but is a plasticizer that can cause gaskets to leak.

According to internal GM documents, the ultimate culprit appears to be operating vehicles for long periods of time with low coolant levels. The low coolant is caused by pressure caps that fail in the open position. (The new caps and recovery bottles were introduced at the same time as DEX-COOL). This exposes hot engine components to air and vapors, causing corrosion and contamination of the coolant with iron oxide particles, which in turn can aggravate the pressure cap problem as contamination holds the caps open permanently.

Honda and Toyota&#x27;s new extended life coolants use OAT with sebacate, but without the 2-EHA. Some added phosphates provide protection while the OAT builds up. Honda specifically excludes 2-EHA from its formulas.

Typically, OAT antifreeze contains an orange dye to differentiate it from the conventional glycol-based coolants (green or yellow), though some OAT products may contain a red or mauve dye. Some of the newer OAT coolants claim to be compatible with &quot;all&quot; types of OAT and glycol-based coolants; these are typically green or yellow in color.

===Hybrid organic acid technology===
HOAT coolants typically mix an OAT with a traditional inhibitor, usually silicates.

An example is Zerex G05, which is a low-silicate, phosphate free formula that includes the benzoate inhibitor.

A HOAT coolant can have a life expectancy as high as 10 years / 180,000 miles.

====Phosphate hybrid organic acid technology====
P-HOAT coolants mix phosphates with HOAT. This technology is typically used in Asian makes and is often dyed red or blue.

====Silicate hybrid organic acid technology====
Si-OAT coolants mix silicates with HOAT. This technology is typically used in European makes and is often dyed pink.

==Additives==

All automotive antifreeze formulations, including the newer organic acid (OAT antifreeze) formulations, are environmentally hazardous because of the blend of additives (around 5%), including lubricants, buffers, and corrosion inhibitors. Because the additives in antifreeze are proprietary, the safety data sheets (SDS) provided by the manufacturer list only those compounds which are considered to be significant safety hazards when used in accordance with the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. Common additives include sodium silicate, disodium phosphate, sodium molybdate, sodium borate, denatonium benzoate, and dextrin (hydroxyethyl starch).

Disodium fluorescein dye is added to conventional ethylene glycol formulas to visually distinguish leaked amounts from other vehicle fluids, and as a marker of type to distinguish it from incompatible types. This dye fluoresces bright green when illuminated by blue or UV light from daylight or testing lamps.

Automotive antifreeze has a characteristic odor due to the additive tolyltriazole, a corrosion inhibitor. The unpleasant odor in industrial-use tolyltriazole comes from impurities in the product that are formed from the toluidine isomers (ortho-, meta-, and para-toluidine) and meta-diamino toluene which are side-products in the manufacture of tolyltriazole. These side-products are highly reactive and produce volatile aromatic amines which are responsible for the unpleasant odor.

==Poisoning==
Antifreeze is a poisonous substance and is considered to be very dangerous to ingest. The main ingredient which makes it dangerous is ethylene glycol, which, when ingested, is metabolized in the liver into various intermediate substances, which then get turned into oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is incredibly dangerous as it can cause, among other ailments, kidney failure, which is why a major treatment for antifreeze poisoning is dialysis to combat said kidney failure. Antifreeze is commonly consumed due to its sweet taste cause by the ethylene glycol, and is also commonly consumed as a surrogate alcohol due to its high alcohol contents. To prevent consumption due to taste, many brands have bitter additives, but many studies do not support the idea bitter additives reduce ingestions. Common symptoms of poisoning are vomiting, confusion, Abdominal pain, Agitation, ataxia and hematuria. Long term damage such as kidney damage, brain damage, central nervous system damage, and blindness are common.

<text>Hugs (Haskell User&#x27;s Gofer System), also Hugs 98, is a bytecode interpreter for the functional programming language Haskell. Hugs is the successor to Gofer, and was originally derived from Gofer version 2.30b. Hugs and Gofer were originally developed by Mark P. Jones, now a professor at Portland State University.

Hugs comes with a simple graphics library. As a complete Haskell implementation that is portable and simple to install, Hugs is sometimes recommended for new Haskell users.

Hugs deviates from the Haskell 98 specification in several minor ways. For example, Hugs does not support mutually recursive modules. A list of differences exists.

The Hugs prompt is a Haskell read–eval–print loop (REPL). It accepts expressions for evaluation, but not module, type, or function definitions. Hugs can load Haskell modules at start-up.

== Examples ==
=== Extensible records ===
An example of &quot;typed records with extensibility&quot;, a non-standard feature unique to Hugs.

<text>The Manx Labour Party is a political party on the Isle of Man that was founded in 1918.

==Policies==

The Manx Labour Party published a manifesto of policies in 2021. It proposed increasing government spending on education to a minimum of 4% of GDP, stated opposition to privatisation of the healthcare sector, and supported increasing the statutory minimum wage.

==History==
The Manx Labour Party was formed in 1918, making it the first organised political party on the island. Its formation was prompted by the high level of indirect taxation as a proportion of the Isle of Man Government&#x27;s income, the relatively low wages, and the lack of social legislation. The founders of the party saw that as being unfair to the poorest in society and wanted to increase the reliance on income taxation instead, and to introduce social legislation such as old age pensions. Christopher R. Shimmin, a founder of the MLP, had written in 1915; &quot;In Manxland there is no state insurance, no worker&#x27;s compensation, no factory laws, and for the aged worker, when poor and feebly tottering to the grave, no old age pension. Rightly has the Isle of Man been called &quot;A paradise for the rich but a purgatory for the poor&quot;.

The Manx Labour Party had its roots in the Chartist movement on the Isle of Man, the union movement, various reforming organisations such as the Manx Reform League, and a culture of debating societies and self-education societies focused around the Island&#x27;s various churches. Like similar parties in neighbouring countries, the MLP&#x27;s influences were more Methodist than Marxist.

The election of 1919 which brought Manx Labour MHKs into Tynwald followed increasing pressure for reform from the working and middle classes during WW1. The Manx general strike of 1918 was in support of a bread subsidy to be paid for through by income tax, to counter the high food prices caused by wartime shortages, and a widespread lack of household income caused by the collapse of the Island&#x27;s visiting industry. Meanwhile, Tynwald was receiving substantial payments from the UK for hosting WW1 internment camps. The strike started on 4 July and forced Governor Raglan to cancel the 1918 Tynwald Day ceremony. Raglan eventually backed down over the bread subsidy, and subsequently left the Island on long term sick leave. Alf Teare, founder of the Manx branch of the Workers’ Union and one of the leaders of the strike, was described in 1918 as ‘the most powerful man on the Island.’ It was a remarkable testament to the reversal of fortunes which wartime conditions had produced.

Between 1919, when Labour Party candidates stood in every constituency on the island bar one, and 1946, the party won between four and seven seats in the House of Keys.

In 1920 the new Tynwald started a programme of social reform. In 1920 Old Age pensions were introduced, a National Health Insurance Act was passed, a new Education Act was passed, and a school medical service established. In 1921 a Shop Hours Act was passed, and a winter works scheme was set up, to do works such as building promenades. Unemployment was higher in winter as most of the tourist industry, agriculture and fishing work was in the summer season. From 1922 to 1924 a housing programme was extended across the Island.

In 1933 Marion Shimmin of the MLP was the first woman MHK ever elected. She was the widow of recently deceased Christopher R. Shimmin, and replaced him as MHK for Peel.

At the 1946 election the party had high hopes of emulating the British Labour Party&#x27;s success in the 1945 UK general election and contested the election on a staunchly socialist manifesto. The party contested every seat in the House of Keys except the Speaker&#x27;s seat, but won only two. During the 1950s and 1960s the party made a limited recovery, but it has never been able to achieve the level of representation it had before 1946.

Since its founding, the Manx Labour Party had campaigned every election on a policy of nationalising land, transport and public utilities. However, after the party&#x27;s defeat in the 1946 general election Manx Labour stopped campaigning on any policy of nationalisation. This was formalised in 1994 when the party changed Clause IIIb of its constitution, the party&#x27;s equivalent to Clause IV of the UK Labour Party. While the original version of Clause IIIb called for the &#x27;common ownership of the means of production&#x27;, the 1994 rewrite called for the party &#x27;to promote the political, social, and economic emancipation of the people of the Isle of Man and to fight against social injustice and intolerance.&#x27; 

In the 2001 election, the party polled the highest percentage of votes (17.3%) among the parties standing, and two of its three candidates won seats. However, independent candidates won the vast bulk of the votes and seats at the election, and the political pressure group, Alliance for Progressive Government, won more seats (three), despite getting a smaller share of the vote (14.6%).

The Manx Labour Party has had continuous influence in Tynwald while it had members there, as MLP members were appointed as ministers and board chairmen as a matter of course. This is part of the Island&#x27;s manner of politics which has usually been based on coalition and consensus in modern times, with most Tynwald members having some administrative responsibility.

The Liberal Vannin Party was founded by Peter Karran who was, until 2004, a Member of the House of Keys for the Manx Labour Party.

David Cretney was the only Manx Labour Party candidate to successfully stand in the 2011 general election.

In March 2013 Michael Ronald Coleman, who had previously failed in his bid to be popularly elected to the House of Keys in the 2006 general election (16.3% of the poll), was made a member of the Legislative Council.

Since 2015 former MHK David Cretney was a member of the Legislative council, giving the party its second seat, until his tenure ended in February 2020.

Michael Coleman&#x27;s tenure ended in March 2018, leaving David Cretney as the party&#x27;s sole representative, until his tenure ended in February 2020.

In 2018 Manx Labour was a founding member of the Isle of Man Climate Change Coalition following the IPCC report of that year calling for urgent action.

Joney Faragher was elected as the new leader and Sarah Maltby as the new Chair of the Manx Labour Party on Saturday 27 June 2020.

==Election results==

===Local government===

The party&#x27;s electoral renaissance began in October 2020 when Devon Watson and Samuel Hamer won both available seats in the Derby Ward by-election for Douglas Borough Council.




The 2021 Local Authority elections were contested by Devon Watson, Samuel Hamer and Peter Washington in Douglas and Fenella Logan in Onchan. Devon Watson and Peter Washington were elected to Douglas Borough Council, and Fenella Logan was elected as an Onchan Commissioner.

===House of Keys===

For the 2021 general election the party put forward three candidates. Joney Faragher in Douglas East and Sarah Maltby in Douglas South both topped their respective polls, while Gareth Young in Garff came a credible third with 1021 votes.

<text>Bruno Mégret (; born 4 April 1949) is a French former nationalist politician. He was the leader of the Mouvement National Républicain political party, but retired in 2008 from all political action.

==Youth and studies==
Born in Paris, Mégret studied at the École Polytechnique and at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, and is by profession a senior civil servant. He also holds a Master&#x27;s degree from the University of California, Berkeley. A graduate of the armored cavalry school of Saumur, he is also a reserve army captain.

Mégret was ranked 317th at the competition for entrance at École Polytechnique in 1969, and since at that time only 300 candidates were admitted every year, he could enter only because some students preferred to study at the slightly more prestigious École Normale Supérieure and turned down the École Polytechnique. However, at École Polytechnique he proved a very dedicated student, and was ranked 18th at the end of the studies. This enabled him to choose between the École des Mines and the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées to finish his engineering studies. After graduating from the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, he spent the academic year 1974–1975 in Berkeley, and obtained a Master of Science. He then returned to France to work for the Ministère de l&#x27;Équipement.

==The Club de l&#x27;Horloge==
In 1975, Mégret met Yvan Blot at the Commissariat Général du Plan, who invited him to join the &quot;Club de l&#x27;Horloge&quot;. At the &quot;Club de l&#x27;Horloge&quot;, he became friends with Jean-Claude Bardet and Jean-Yves Le Gallou, who with Yvan Blot were also members of the GRECE. In 1977, Mégret started to work as an engineer on highway construction, at the Direction Départementale de l&#x27;Équipement (DDE) of Essonne. During this period, he contributed to the publications of the Club de l&#x27;Horloge. In 1979, he became technical advisor to the minister of cooperation Robert Galley. He also joined the &quot;Rassemblement pour la République&quot; (conservative political party) and was conservative candidate for legislative elections in 1981 against Michel Rocard in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine.
 In 1981, after the defeat of the conservatives in legislative elections, finding the RPR too moderate, and realizing that not being a graduate from the École Nationale d&#x27;Administration like Jacques Toubon or Jean-François Mancel or Alain Juppé was slowing down his political career in the Rassemblement pour la République, he went on to create the Comités d&#x27;Action Républicaine (CAR). However, the appearance of the &quot;Front National&quot; at the European Parliament elections of 1984, shattered the hopes of the CAR which did not even manage to have a list of candidates for these elections.

==In the National Front and the MNR==
In 1985, Mégret joined Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s &quot;National Front&quot; (FN, a nationalist political party). In 1986, he was elected to the French National Assembly, representing Isère. A rival of Jean-Pierre Stirbois, then general secretary of the FN (who died in 1988), he organised Le Pen&#x27;s election campaign in 1987 and became the number two (&quot;délégué général&quot;) in the movement.

He was a member of the European Parliament for the FN from 1989 to 1999. In 1989, Mégret created the &quot;Institut de formation nationale&quot;, the &quot;Centre d&#x27;études et d&#x27;argumentaires&quot;, the magazine &quot;Identité&quot;, the &quot;conseil scientifique&quot; and the publishing house &quot;Editions Nationales&quot; to elaborate the doctrine and diffuse the ideas of the Front National. His friends of the Club de l&#x27;Horloge Jean-Yves Le Gallou, Jean-Claude Bardet, Yvan Blot and Jean-Jacques Mourreau of the CAR also secured key positions in the hierarchy of the Front National.

However, the relationship between Le Pen and Mégret turned sour during the following decade. Mégret and others inside the Front started criticizing Le Pen&#x27;s &quot;extremist&quot; positions, which, they argued, prevented the Front from obtaining political executive positions. Moreover, Mégret started to become very popular with the party members, winning large support against his rival Bruno Gollnisch, who had been made vice-president and general secretary of the Front National by Le Pen in 1995.

On 9 February 1997, Mégret&#x27;s wife, Catherine Mégret, was elected mayor of Vitrolles. Following the social unrest of November–December 1995, Mégret developed a strategy of creating new unions (FN-RATP, FN-TCL, FN-Poste, Mouvement pour une Education Nationale, FN-Police) and professional organisations tied to the Front National to increase the audience of the party. This strategy contrasted sharply with the previous traditional anti-union stance of the Front National.

In 1998, Mégret split from the &quot;Front National&quot; and founded, with Jean-Yves Le Gallou, the &quot;Mouvement National Républicain&quot;.

He received 2.33% of the vote in the first round of the 2002 French presidential election. Mégret endorsed Jean-Marie Le Pen in the runoff against Jacques Chirac. He also supported Le Pen in the 2007 presidential election.

After he was sentenced to 8 months of probation, 8000 Euro fine and one-year ban from standing in any election for defalcation of public funds, he resigned in 2008 from the political field. He used money from the town Vitrolles to support his 2002 presidential run.

In 2022 he voiced support for the candidacy of Éric Zemmour in the 2022 French presidential election, judging that Zemmour &quot;embodies the right path for our ideas and for France&quot;. He criticised the leadership of Marine Le Pen for what Mégret perceives to be the &quot;de-demonization and then standardization&quot; of the Rassemblement National, judging her to have &#x27;eroded&#x27; the party&#x27;s firm stance on issues relating to security and identity.

<text>The Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC) was a subcommand of the Allied South East Asia Command (SEAC) during World War II. It controlled Allied ground operations in northern Burma. For most of its existence, NCAC was commanded by United States Army General Joseph &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; Stilwell (who concurrently held more senior command positions). In 1945 after Stilwell was recalled, his deputy, Lieutenant General Daniel Sultan, was promoted to and assumed command.

Chinese Nationalist National Revolutionary Army personnel constituted most of the combat units within NCAC.

While it was initially intended that NCAC would operate as an integral part of the British 11th Army Group, Stilwell refused to work under General George Giffard and was made subordinate to the Supreme Commander of SEAC, Lord Louis Mountbatten.

==Composition==
In 1942, Northern Combat Area Command was formed at Ramgarh Cantonment, in India, from X Force: units (including the 22nd and 38th Divisions), which had retreated out of Burma. After its arrival in India, X Force was reinforced – eventually becoming the New 1st Army – a corps-level formation. It was re-equipped at British expense and re-trained by US Army instructors.

For the campaigning season of early 1944, NCAC was augmented with Merrill&#x27;s Marauders – a brigade-sized formation created by the US Army for commando -type operations in Burma. During 1944, NCAC forced the Japanese 18th Division to retreat out of northern Burma and US Army engineering battalions, assisted by Indian laborers built the Ledo Road – which joined the northern end of the Burma Road and reestablished communications between India and China. Towards the end of 1944, NCAC was reinforced by the British 36th Infantry Division.

In 1945, under Sultan&#x27;s command, NCAC – which now included the Chinese New 6th Army – aided in the drive to retake the rest of Burma.

==Campaigns==
The main combat power of NCAC, at least in terms of numbers, were its Chinese divisions. When British and Chinese forces had been forced out of Burma at the start of 1942, some Chinese forces had been obliged to retreat to India, rather than to China. It was from these formations that NCAC was created.

Many times during World War II, British and American commanders in India were frustrated by their Chinese allies. A combination of fickleness and over-centralisation by the Chinese generalissimo, Chiang Kai-shek and the limited training of the Chinese forces meant that they often failed to live up to their potential. However, the Chinese forces in NCAC were considerably better than their contemporaries in China itself. Greater access to American equipment and training and less influence from the Chinese leadership meant the four Chinese divisions in NCAC could be trusted a great deal more in combat.

However, it was not only from NCAC&#x27;s divisions that trouble sprang. Its first commander was an extremely controversial character. Stilwell had first been posted to China as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek. However, as the campaign in Burma developed, he also took on a role there. The US Army established the China Burma India Theater (CBI Theater), and placed Stilwell in command. The CBI Theater was not supposed to be an operational headquarters: it was merely supposed to be in charge of the administration of the American military formations in China, Burma and India. However, Stilwell often broke the chain of command and communicated directly with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on operational matters, when all such communications were supposed to go to Admiral Lord Mountbatten the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia and also on taking operational control of NCAC through General George Giffard commander of 11th Army Group.

The initial idea was that as General Stilwell would be commanding several Chinese divisions which would attack out of India from the West and with the large but amorphous Yunnan armies attacking out of China from the East, he would be commanding a large army. So his command should be placed under 11th Army Group at the same level as the Fourteenth which was under the command of General William Slim. The attacks could then be coordinated at Army Group level.

At a meeting to sort out the operational chain of command for the three fronts in Burma, Stilwell astonished everyone by saying &quot;I am prepared to come under General Slim&#x27;s operational control until I get to Kamaing&quot;. Rather than sack him, Mountbatten reluctantly agreed to this, but it was a dangerous compromise. It created a complicated chain of command where Slim theoretically had to report to two different commanders: Giffard for Fourteenth Army actions, and Mountbatten for Stilwell&#x27;s formations. Under a general less gifted than Slim this could have caused serious problems, if Slim had not been able to command Stilwell at an operational level without disagreement (which given Stilwell&#x27;s proven record was more than likely). But at an operational level Slim was able to work with Stilwell and &quot;this illogical command set-up worked surprisingly well&quot;.

The reason why it was essential that there was one operational commander for the three fronts, North, Central and Southern, was so that the intended attacks in late 1944 could be coordinated to prevent the Japanese concentrating large numbers of reserves for a counterattack on any one front.

Stilwell thus had four different jobs to perform, which required him to be in different places at once. For example, as Chief of Staff to Chiang, he was often needed in Chongqing, the Chinese capital, and as Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was needed at HQ South East Asia Command at Kandy in Ceylon and as NCAC commander he was required to be relatively near the frontline in Burma. His personality also caused problems. Stilwell clashed frequently with the commander of the 11th Army Group, General Giffard, and would not accept being under his command, instead insisting that NCAC came directly under the Supreme Commander. As Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was Giffard&#x27;s superior but as operational commander of NCAC Giffard was his superior. As the two men did not get on this inevitably led to conflict and confusion.

NCAC&#x27;s first months were frustrating, as the time was for all Allied formations in the theater. Its first real success did not come until the 1943-44 campaigning season. The Chindits had been dropped behind enemy lines after the end of the 1943 monsoon to cause havoc by cutting communications. This they did, but the original operational plan failed for a number of reasons. In the end, they were sent northwards into NCAC&#x27;s area of operations.

At the time, NCAC&#x27;s main job was to capture the town of Myitkyina, as a prelude to connecting the Ledo Road to the Burma Road and reestablishing land communications to China. During the offensive, NCAC intelligence staff serving under General Stilwell repeatedly underestimated Japanese troop strength in Burma. A thrust from the northwest by NCAC was meeting with some success, but Stilwell also needed to use the Chindits in his plan. However, he not only used them but misused them. The Chindits were designed as a light raiding force, not as conventional infantry. They had negligible artillery support and were much smaller in number than equivalent conventional formations. However, Stilwell insisted on using them as conventional infantry. He assigned them the task of capturing Mogaung south of Myitkyina, which was strongly held by the Japanese. The Chindits succeeded in their task but suffered horrendous casualties. Even then Stilwell was not finished. He demanded still further miracles from the Chindits and their commander Brigadier Lentaigne. Reduced to the equivalent of less than a battalion, the Chindits assisted in the final assault on Myitkyina before finally being flown out to India as a completely broken force. The American equivalent of the Chindits, Merrill&#x27;s Marauders also suffered from the same treatment during the campaign, consistently being asked to perform missions that were beyond their power without superhuman effort.

After the fall of Myitkyina, only a small area of Japanese territory separated NCAC from the Chinese forces. As the 1944 monsoon ended, NCAC opened an offensive. It had been reinforced with the British 36th Infantry Division, which gave it a considerably increased punch. However, the Japanese 33rd Army under General Masaki Honda performed a very creditable delaying action against the forces attacking them. The Japanese were outnumbered several times but still managed to hold the Chinese forces at bay for several months. In the end, it was events on the main front further south that forced them to withdraw, as they were in danger of being cut off from their supply lines. 36th Division was used to support the left wing of the Fourteenth Army under Lieutenant General William Slim.

In October 1944, due to personal disagreements with Chiang, Stilwell was recalled to the United States by President Roosevelt. His former role was split as was the CBI Theater:
* Lieutenant General Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia.
* Major General Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT).
* Lieutenant General Daniel Isom Sultan was promoted from deputy commander of CBI to become commander of the U.S. Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC.

His replacements were not only less abrasive characters but as they each concentrated on one area there was less institutional conflict and confusion.

NCAC&#x27;s main role in the last few months of the war was to support the British main offensive further south and to further improve the Burma Road to allow more supplies to get into China.

After the war, NCAC was quickly disbanded. It had achieved its objectives, but the route to those objectives was strewn with command problems and missed opportunities.

Among attached United States Army Air Forces units was the 5th Liaison Squadron (August 1944).

<text>The Venezuelan War of Independence (, 1810–1823) was one of the Spanish American wars of independence of the early nineteenth century, when independence movements in South America fought a civil war for secession and against unity of the Spanish Empire, emboldened by Spain&#x27;s troubles in the Napoleonic Wars.

The establishment of the Supreme Caracas Junta following the forced deposition of Vicente Emparan as Captain General of the Captaincy General of Venezuela on 19 April 1810, marked the beginnings of the war. On 5 July 1811, seven of the ten provinces of the Captaincy General of Venezuela declared their independence in the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. The First Republic of Venezuela was lost in 1812 following the 1812 Caracas earthquake and the 1812 Battle of La Victoria. Simón Bolívar led an &quot;Admirable Campaign&quot; to retake Venezuela, establishing the Second Republic of Venezuela in 1813; but this too did not last, falling to a combination of a local uprising and Spanish royalist reconquest. Only as part of Bolívar&#x27;s campaign to liberate New Granada in 1819-20 did Venezuela achieve a lasting independence from Spain (initially as part of Gran Colombia).

On 17 December 1819, the Congress of Angostura declared Gran Colombia an independent country. After two more years of war, the country achieved independence from Spain in 1821 under the leadership of Simón Bolívar. Venezuela, along with the countries of Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador, formed part of the Republic of Gran Colombia until 1830, when Venezuela separated and became a sovereign state.

==First Republic (1810–1812)==

The French invasion of Spain in 1808 led to the fall of the Spanish Monarchy. Most subjects of Spain did not accept the government of Joseph Bonaparte, placed on the Spanish throne by his brother, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte of France. At the same time, the process of creating a stable government in Spain, which would be widely recognized throughout the empire, took two years. (&quot;See Junta (Peninsular War)&quot;.) This created a power vacuum in the Spanish possessions in America, which created further political uncertainty. On April 19, 1810 the municipal council of Caracas headed a successful movement to depose the Spanish Governor and Captain-General, Vicente Emparán. A junta was established in Caracas, and soon other Venezuelan provinces followed suit. The reverberations of this act of independence could be felt throughout Venezuela almost immediately. Across Venezuela, towns and cities decided to either side with the movement based in Caracas or not, and de facto civil war ensued throughout much of Venezuela. The Caracas Junta called for a congress of Venezuelan provinces to establish a government for the region. Initially, both the Junta and Congress upheld the &quot;rights of Ferdinand VII,&quot; meaning that they recognized themselves to still be part of the Spanish Monarchy, but had established a separate government due to the French invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. As Congress deliberated, a faction proposing outright independence quickly won favor. Persons such as Francisco de Miranda, a long-term Venezuelan expatriate, and Simón Bolívar, a young, Criollo aristocrat—both influenced by Age of Enlightenment ideas and the example of the French Revolution—led the movement. The Congress declared Venezuela&#x27;s independence on 5 July 1811, establishing the Republic of Venezuela.

Even before the Congress began its sessions in November 1810, a civil war started between those who supported the juntas, and eventually independence, and royalists who wanted to maintain the union with Spain. Two provinces, Maracaibo Province and Guayana Province, and one district, Coro, never recognized the Caracas Junta and remained loyal to the governments in Spain. Military expeditions to bring Coro and Guayana under the control of the Republic failed. In 1811 an uprising in Valencia against the Republic was successfully suppressed. By 1812 the situation increasingly became aggravated for the young Republic. It was short of funds, Spanish Regency set up a blockade (although it was easily bypassed by British and American merchant ships), and, shortly after, on 26 March 1812, a devastating earthquake affected republican areas. In these desperate moments, Miranda was given dictatorial powers, nevertheless, he was unable to stem the royalist advance headed by Captain Domingo de Monteverde. By midyear, after the Battle of La Victoria, the Republic collapsed. Miranda capitulated to Monteverde and signed an armistice on 25 July 1812.

==Second Republic (1813–1814)==

Bolívar and other republicans continued the resistance from other parts of the Spanish South America and the Caribbean, or organized guerrilla movements in the interior of the country. In 1813 Bolívar joined the army of United Provinces of New Granada. After winning a series of battles, Bolívar received the approval of the New Granadan Congress to lead a liberating force into Venezuela in what became known as the Admirable Campaign. At the same time, Santiago Mariño invaded from the northeast in an independently organized campaign. Both forces quickly defeated the royalist troops in various battles, such as Alto de los Godos. Bolívar entered Caracas on 6 August 1813, proclaiming the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic and his supreme leadership of it, something which was not fully recognized by Mariño based in Cumaná, although the two leaders did cooperate militarily.

In the viceroyalties of La Plata and New Granada the Creoles displaced the Spanish authorities with relative ease, as Caracas had done at first. The autonomous movement swept through New Granada, but the country remained politically disunited. Bogotá inherited the role of capital from Spain, but the royalists were entrenched in southern Colombia (Popayán and Pasto). Cali was a bastion of the independence movement just north of royalist territory. Cartagena declared independence not only from Spain but also from Bogotá. Bolívar arrived in Cartagena and was well received, as he was later in Bogotá, where he joined the army of the United Provinces of New Granada. He recruited a force and invaded Venezuela from the southwest, by crossing the Andes (1813). His chief lieutenant was the headstrong José Félix Ribas. In Trujillo, an Andean province, Bolívar emitted his infamous Decree of War to the Death with which he hoped to get the &quot;pardos&quot; and any &quot;mantuano&quot; who was having second thoughts on his side. At the time that Bolívar was victorious in the west, Santiago Mariño and Manuel Piar, a &quot;pardo&quot; from the Dutch island of Curaçao, were successfully fighting royalists in eastern Venezuela. Quickly losing ground (much as Miranda had a year earlier) Monteverde took refuge in Puerto Cabello, and Bolívar occupied Caracas, re-establishing the Republic, with two &quot;states&quot;, one in the west headed by Bolívar and one in the east headed by Mariño.

But neither the successful invasions nor Bolívar&#x27;s decree were provoking a massive enrollment of &quot;pardos&quot; in the cause of Independence. Rather it was the other way around. In the Llanos a populist Spanish immigrant caudillo, José Tomás Boves, initiated a widespread &quot;pardo&quot; movement against the restored Republic. Bolívar and Ribas held and defended the &quot;mantuano&quot;-controlled center of Venezuela. In the east, the royalists started recovering territory. After suffering a setback, Mariño and Bolívar joined their forces, but they were defeated by Boves in 1814. Republicans were forced to evacuate Caracas and flee to the east, where, in the port of Carúpano, Piar was still holding out. Piar, however, did not accept Bolívar&#x27;s supreme command, and once again Bolívar left Venezuela and went to New Granada (1815). &quot;(See Bolívar in New Granada).&quot;

Resistance to the Republic this time came from the people of the vast southern plains, the &quot;Llaneros&quot;, who organized under the command of Spanish immigrant, José Tomás Boves. The war was transformed. The &quot;Llaneros&quot; had a dislike for the urban and elite Criollos who led the independence movement. Negroes were supplied with maps and lists of rebel plantations by royalists. The &quot;Llanero&quot; army routed the patriots in the center of the country. Finally Boves marched towards Caracas, forcing the Republicans to flee to the east of the country, ending the second republic.

The traditional image of the Venezuelan llanos swarming with caudillos like Boves exaggerates the situation. Boves was the only significant pro-Spain caudillo and he was acting in concert with Francisco Tomás Morales, who was a regular officer of Spain. In the Battle of Urica, Boves was killed and Morales took command and carried out mopping up operations against the remaining patriot resistance, which included the capture and execution of Ribas. As was still common in the early 19th century, Morales had his head boiled in oil (to preserve it) and sent to Caracas. &quot;(See the Execution of Miguel Hidalgo in Mexico.)&quot; Boves died shortly thereafter in battle, but the country had been returned to royalist control. Morillo arrived in Venezuela and began operations with Morales.

==Spanish reconquest of New Granada (1815–1816)==
In Spain, anti-French forces had liberated the country, and the restored Ferdinand VII sent a large expeditionary force to Venezuela and New Granada under Pablo Morillo, who had distinguished himself during Spain&#x27;s War of Independence.

Royalist forces under Morillo and Morales captured Cartagena and Bogotá in 1816. Before leaving for New Granada Morillo had decommissioned most of the irregular forces that had fought under Boves, except those that he took to New Granada. With little prospects, some &quot;pardos&quot; and &quot;llaneros&quot; began to join the rebellions that were breaking out against Spanish rule in the broad plains of southern Venezuela. In the meantime, Bolívar chose to sail to Jamaica to enlist British aid, which was refused. From there, he went to Haiti, which had been the first Latin American republic to become independent. With the support of the Haitian president Alexandre Pétion and with the naval aid of Luis Brión, another émigré, who was a merchant from Curaçao, Bolívar returned to Margarita Island, a secure republican redoubt, but his command of the republican forces was still not firm. Mariño, who had come back with Bolívar from Haiti, headed his own expeditions and succeeded in temporarily capturing Cumaná in 1817. With Brión supplying a small fleet, Bolívar sailed west along the Venezuelan coast to Ocumare de la Costa (the Expedition of Los Cayos), where, in fulfillment of Pétion&#x27;s request, he officially proclaimed the end of slavery (although this went unheeded). Morales, back in Venezuela after subduing New Granada, attacked the republican expeditionary force with an army that vastly outnumbered the republicans. Bolívar fled, sailing once again to Haiti with Brión. However, Piar and Gregor MacGregor, a Scottish soldier of fortune, who had previously been active in New Granada, managed to escape with their forces into the interior of the country, defeating Morales at El Juncal in September 1816 before moving south to Guayana.

Boves&#x27;s locally raised &quot;Llanero&quot; army was replaced in 1815 by a formal expedition sent from Spain under the leadership of Pablo Morillo. It was the largest expedition the Spanish had ever sent to the Americas. Venezuela&#x27;s proximity to Cuba, Puerto Rico and Spain made it the first target of the royalist counterattack. The &quot;Llaneros&quot; were either demobilized or incorporated into the expeditionary units. The republican patriots found themselves once more dispersed, and again the war took a local character. Different patriot guerrilla bands formed, but could not agree on a united leadership, much less a united strategy. One group of patriots launched an expedition to eastern Venezuela that ended in failure. Bolívar thereafter sought to join forces with Manuel Piar, another patriot leader but differences between them prevented a united republican front. Bolívar then went to the Llanos where he joined forces with José Antonio Páez, but a failed attack on central Venezuela forced Bolivar to retreat back to Apure. Morillo counterattacked successfully but was defeated at the Battle of Las Queseras del Medio. A long-term stalemate ensued in which the royalists controlled the highly populated, urban north and the republicans the vast, under-populated plains of the south.

==Stalemate (1816–1819)==
Bolívar and Brión returned and tried in 1817 to capture Barcelona, where the Spaniards repulsed them. In the meantime, Piar and Mariño had occupied defenceless Angostura (a city at the narrowest and deepest part of the Orinoco River, hence its name, subsequently changed to Ciudad Bolívar), to where Bolívar headed and was chosen as supreme leader of the independence movement. (It was at this time that Bolívar ordered the addition of a new star for Guayana to the seven stars on the Venezuelan flag, which represented the number of provinces that originally had favored independence. Since Bolívar played a central role in the symbolism of the Venezuelan government led by Chávez, this long-forgotten change was revived in the 2006 revision to the flag.) Once in Guayana, Bolívar quickly cashiered Piar, who had been trying (or was accused of trying—historians still debate this) to form a &quot;pardo&quot; force of his own, by having him arrested and executed after a court martial in which Brión was one of the judges. British veterans of the Napoleonic wars began arriving in Venezuela, where they formed the nucleus of what later became known as the British Legion. Morillo returned to Caracas and Morales was given troops to dominate eastern Venezuela, which he did successfully. Francisco de Paula Santander, a New Granadan who had retreated to the llanos after Morillo&#x27;s invasion, met with Bolívar and agreed to join forces. Morillo&#x27;s other lieutenant, the second in command of the expeditionary force, Miguel de la Torre, was ordered to put down a significant rebellion in the llanos of Apure led by José Antonio Páez. At the time in the Southern Cone of South America, José de San Martín had concluded the liberation of Chile with the essential support of the Chilean Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins.

The year 1818 saw a stalemate between the patriots based in Angostura (and free-wheeling in part of the llanos) and Morillo (entrenched in Caracas, triumphant in eastern Venezuela, and operating in the llanos as far as Apure). This is the time during which (according to Marx), Bolívar dilly-dallied and lost one skirmish after another, also saying that European officers in Angostura were egging him on to attack the center of Venezuela. (Bolívar did attempt to do so, but suffered defeat at La Puerta.) At the time James Rooke did in fact command over 1,000 European soldiers within Bolívar&#x27;s army in Venezuela. But Morillo had larger forces, and not just of Spanish line troops but also of pardos still loyal to the Spanish crown.

In 1819 Bolívar proclaimed the republic of Great Colombia, which included Venezuela and New Granada. New volunteers arrived in Venezuela, though most, like those that preceded them, were in essence mercenaries probably under the illusion that there were fortunes to be made in Venezuela, which was hardly the case. There is no evidence that the British government was backing them, but since Spain was no longer a British ally, it was not hindering them either. In Europe, generally, Bolívar&#x27;s name was known as was the Spanish American movement for independence, which had the sympathy of every liberal-minded person, as did the independence of Greece, then also in the process of emancipation. Morillo had his hands full and pardos were starting to look towards patriot leaders. Campaigns in eastern Venezuela began turning the tide for independence and in the llanos Páez defeated Morillo and Morales in Apure. This cleared the way for Bolívar and Santander to invade New Granada, where, in Pantano de Vargas, the Spaniards were defeated in a battle in which the British Legion played a central role and its commander, Rooke, was killed in action. In the battle of Boyacá (1819), Spanish power was crushed in New Granada, except in the south. Páez occupied Barinas and, from New Granada, Bolívar invaded Venezuela.

== Consolidation of independence ==

In 1819, to break this impasse Bolívar invaded New Granada, which had been reconquered by Morillo&#x27;s expeditionary force three years earlier. Bolívar decisively defeated the royalists at Boyacá. With the liberation of New Granada, the republicans had a significant base from which to attack Morillo&#x27;s forces. A republican Congress at Angostura (today Ciudad Bolívar), which already had a small New Granada delegation, declared the union of New Granada and Venezuela in a Republic of Colombia (the Gran Colombia of contemporary accounts) to present a united front against the Spanish Monarchy.

In 1821, the Gran Colombian army won a decisive victory at the second Battle of Carabobo, after which the only cities in the hands of the royalist forces were Cumaná, which fell shortly thereafter, and Puerto Cabello, which managed to resist a siege before finally capitulating in October 1823.

== Aftermath ==
The Spanish sent a fleet in 1823 to reconquer the country but were defeated at the Battle of Lake Maracaibo. In the following years Venezuelan forces, as part of the army of Gran Colombia, continued campaigning under the leadership of Bolívar to liberate the southern parts of New Granada and Ecuador. Once this was accomplished, Gran Colombia continued its fight against the Spanish in Peru and Bolivia, completing the efforts of Chilean and Argentine patriots, such as José de San Martín, who liberated southern South America.

== Gual and España Conspiracy ==
San Blas Conspiracy

It consisted of a Liberal movement that involved the installation of democracy in Spain, inspired by the French Revolution and with the participation of important members of the society. Regardless this attempt at democracy failed, and some of their members were sent to prisons in Spanish Colonies, one of them, Juan Batista Picornell, was sent to the Port of La Guaira,  where he secretly met with Manuel Gual and Jose Maria España. His revolutionary Ideas spread like wildfire throughout the country, and sooner than later both Gual and España found themselves leading a conspiracy against the Spanish rule.

Manuel Gual and Jose Maria España

This conspiracy took place in the city of La Guaira, it was inspired by both the San Blas Conspiracy and the French revolution, and similar to the first one, it was led by very important members of the society, lawyers, engineers, and merchants, regardless of this, people from all races and status in society joined and conspired against the colonists. One of the main objectives this movement followed was the equality of man and equal rights for every one, either black or white, rich or poor. According to Tomas Fernandez and Elena Tamaro, this conspiracy had gained a lot of supporters both inside and outside the country, even the British and French navies supported their ambition of freedom against the Spanish rule.

In July of 1797 the conspiracy was supposed to materialize it&#x27;s ambitions, but the Spanish Authorities including the Bishop of Caracas and the Governor of the Captaincy General of Venezuela, were quick enough to capture, interrogate and torture every individual suspected to be part of this conspiracy. Both Manuel Gual and Jose Maria España escaped to the Antilles, and even met again in Trinidad shortly after. España came back in 1799, he arrived to Barcelona and came back to la Guaira where he aspired to continue with his ambitions, regardless of the 5000 pesos reward on his head. He stayed in the port until he was captured, tortured and dismembered by the Spanish authorities. His parts where displayed all around the city of Caracas, which set an example of what happened to anybody that challenged their authority. According to the &quot;Instituto Panamericano de Geografía e Historia&quot; Gual never set foot again in Venezuela, and died while being persecuted by the Spanish.

Legacy

These events inspired liberals in the Americas to realize that this goal may be achieved. The Spanish authorities instead of achieving what they wanted with their treatment of revolutionaries, inspired even more hate and liberalism in the overall public. This conspiracy gave the Americas a message, that was transmitted through not only speech but by text and Ideas, Documents like &quot;Derechos del Hombre y del Ciudadano&quot; where widely spread throughout the country and helped achieve the ultimate goal of independence from the colonists.

<text>A Klondike bar is a Good Humor-Breyers ice cream novelty. The product is made with frozen dairy dessert and a chocolatey coating. 

==History==
The Klondike bar was created by the Isaly Dairy Company of Mansfield, Ohio in the early 1920s and named after the Klondike River of Yukon, Canada. Rights to the name were eventually sold to Good Humor-Breyers, a division of Unilever.

The first recorded advertisement for the Klondike was on February 5, 1922, in the &quot;Youngstown Vindicator&quot;. The bars are generally wrapped with a silver-colored wrapper depicting a polar bear mascot for the brand. Unlike a traditional frozen ice pop, or traditional ice cream bar, the Klondike bar does not have a stick due to its size, a point often touted in advertising.

In 1976, Henry Clarke, owner of the Clabir company, purchased the rights to the Klondike bar, which had been manufactured and sold by the Isaly&#x27;s restaurant chain since the 1930s. Clarke introduced Klondike bars to consumers throughout the United States during the 1980s. Under Clarke, sales of the Klondike bar increased from $800,000 annually at the time of the 1976 acquisition by Clabir to more than $60 million.

In 1986, the US 11th Circuit Court of Appeals prohibited Kraft Foods from using a wrapper resembling the distinctive Klondike bar wrapper (its &quot;trade dress&quot;) for Kraft&#x27;s &quot;Polar B&#x27;ar&quot; brand ice cream bars. The following year, the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the lower court ruling. In 1988, Kraft settled a trademark dispute with Ambrit Inc., as the former Isaly Company, Inc. was then known, for $8.5 million.

<doc id="562864" wikidata="Q163107" url="?curid=562864" title="2002 Überlingen mid-air collision">
<text>On 1 July 2002, BAL Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937, a Tupolev Tu-154 passenger jet, and DHL International Aviation ME Flight 611, a Boeing 757 cargo jet, collided in mid-air over Überlingen, a southern German town on Lake Constance, near the German-Swiss border. All of the passengers and crew aboard both planes were killed, resulting in a total death toll of 71.

The official investigation by the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (; BFU) identified the main cause of the collision to be a number of shortcomings on the part of the Swiss air traffic control (ATC) service in charge of the sector involved, as well as ambiguities in the procedures regarding the use of the traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) on board.

On 24 February 2004, Peter Nielsen, the air traffic controller on duty at the time of the collision, was murdered in an apparent act of revenge by Vitaly Kaloyev, a Russian architect whose wife and two children died in the accident.

== Background ==

=== Tupolev aircraft and crew ===
BAL Bashkirian Airlines flight BTC2937 was a chartered flight from Moscow, Russia, to Barcelona, Spain, carrying 60 passengers and 9 crew. Forty-six of the passengers were Russian schoolchildren from the city of Ufa, in Bashkortostan, on a school trip organised by the local UNESCO committee to the Costa Daurada beach area of Catalonia. Most of the parents of the children were high-ranking officials in Bashkortostan. One of the fathers was the head of the local UNESCO committee. They travelled on an overnight train to Moscow and arrived on 29 June, then, as their driver accidentally took them to the wrong airport, they missed their original flight. They remained there for two days until 1 July in order to find the arranged chartered flight. Flight 2937 departed from Moscow Domodedovo Airport at 22:48 Moscow Time (18:48 UTC) bound for Barcelona International Airport (now Josep Tarradellas Barcelona–El Prat Airport).

The aircraft, a 1995-built Tupolev Tu-154M registered as was first delivered to BAL Bashkirian Airlines before being sold to Transeuropean Airlines in 1998. The aircraft was once again sold to Shaheen Air in 1999 before being returned to BAL Bashkirian Airlines in January 2002.

The flight was piloted by an experienced Russian crew: 52-year-old captain Alexander Mikhailovich Gross () and 40-year-old first officer Oleg Pavlovich Grigoriev (). The captain had more than 12,000 flight hours (including 4,918 hours on the Tu-154) to his credit. Grigoriev, the chief pilot of Bashkirian Airlines, had 8,500 hours of flying experience (with 4,317 hours on the Tu-154) and his task was to evaluate Captain Gross&#x27;s performance throughout the flight.

Murat Akhatovich Itkulov (), a 41-year-old pilot with close to 7,900 flight hours (4,181 of them on the Tu-154), who was normally the first officer, did not officially serve on duty because this was the captain&#x27;s assessment flight. Sergei Gennadyevich Kharlov (), a 50-year-old flight navigator with approximately 13,000 flight hours (including 6,421 hours on the Tu-154), and Oleg Irikovich Valeev (), a 37-year-old flight engineer who had almost 4,200 flight hours (all of which were on the Tu-154), joined the three pilots in the cockpit.

=== Boeing aircraft and crew ===
DHL International Aviation ME flight 611, was a 1990-built Boeing 757-23APF and was first delivered to Zambia Airways as before being sold to Gulf Air as in late 1993. It was then sold to SNAS Aviation in 1996 under the same registration. The aircraft was then sold to European Air Transport as in 2000 until 2002 before being sold once again to DHL International as . The flight was being flown by two Bahrain-based pilots, 47-year-old British Captain Paul Phillips and 34-year-old Canadian first officer Brant Campioni, who had to fly the second leg of the journey. Both pilots were very experienced — Phillips had logged close to 12,000 flight hours (including 4,145 hours on the 757) and Campioni had accumulated more than 6,600 flight hours, with 176 of them on the Boeing 757. Campioni had also previously worked as an air cadet and corporal in the Canadian Military Engineers. At the time of the accident, the aircraft was en route from Bahrain International Airport in Manama, Bahrain, to Brussels Airport in Brussels, Belgium, with a stop at Orio al Serio Airport in Bergamo, Italy, and departed Bergamo at 23:06 CEST (21:06 UTC).

==Accident==


The airspace was controlled from Zürich, Switzerland, by the Swiss federal airspace control Skyguide. Air traffic controller Peter Nielsen, the only controller handling the airspace, was burdened with working two workstations at the same time.

At 23:21 CEST (21:21 UTC), DHL Flight 611 reported to the area control center responsible for southern German airspace. Nielsen then instructed Flight 611 to climb from flight level 260 () to flight level 320 (). Flight 611 requested permission to continue the climb to flight level 360 () to save fuel. Nielsen permitted Flight 611 to climb after about four to five minutes, after which Flight 611 reached the desired altitude at 23:29. Meanwhile, Flight 2937 contacted Nielsen at 23:30, which also reported to be at flight level 360. Nielsen acknowledged the flight, but did not assign a different altitude to either aircraft. That meant that both were now at the same altitude and on a collision course.

At 23:34:49 CEST (21:34:49 UTC), about a minute before the collision, Flight 2937&#x27;s TCAS instructed them to climb; seconds later, Nielsen, realizing the oncoming danger, contacted Flight 2937 and instructed the pilot to descend to flight level 350 (1000 ft lower) to avoid collision with crossing traffic (Flight 611). The crew of Flight 2937 disengaged the autopilot and initiated their descent at 23:35, obeying the controller instead of the TCAS. At about the same time, the TCAS on Flight 611 instructed the crew of that aircraft to descend. The collision would thus not have occurred if both the aircraft&#x27;s crews had obeyed the TCAS&#x27;s instructions.

Flight 611&#x27;s pilots followed their TCAS instructions and initiated a descent, but could not immediately inform Nielsen as he was dealing with Flight 2937. The crew of Flight 2937, however, descended as instructed by Nielsen, contrary to the TCAS&#x27;s instructions which advised the crew to climb. Both planes were now descending.

Unaware of the TCAS-issued alerts, Nielsen repeated his instruction to Flight 2937 to descend, giving the crew incorrect information as to the position of the DHL plane, telling them that the plane was to the right (2 o&#x27;clock position) when it was in fact to the left (10 o&#x27;clock position). About eight seconds before the collision, Flight 611&#x27;s descent rate was about , not quite as rapid as the range advised by the TCAS.

Flight 611, responding to the developing situation, increased its descent rate. Eight seconds before the collision, Flight 2937&#x27;s crew became aware of the situation when they gained visual sight of Flight 611 incoming from the left, and, two seconds before the collision, obeyed their TCAS instruction and attempted to put the aircraft into a climb. Unfortunately, the collision had by then become the aircraft collided at 23:35:32 CEST (21:35:32 UTC), at almost a right angle, at an altitude of , with Flight 611&#x27;s vertical stabilizer slicing completely through Flight 2937&#x27;s fuselage just ahead of the wings. Flight 2937 broke into several pieces, scattering wreckage into the Brachenreute neighborhood over a wide area. The nose section of the aircraft fell vertically, while the tail section with the engines continued, stalled, and fell.

Flight 611, now with 80% of its vertical stabilizer lost, continued for a further for two minutes, before crashing into a wooded area close to the village of Taisersdorf at a 70° downward angle. Each engine ended up several hundred meters away from the main wreckage, and the tail section was torn from the fuselage by trees just before impact. All 69 people onboard Flight 2937 and the 2 crew members on board Flight 611 died.

==Other factors in the crash==
Only one air traffic controller (ATC), Peter Nielsen of ACC Zurich, was controlling the airspace through which the aircraft were flying. The other controller on duty was resting in another room for the night. This was against Skyguide&#x27;s regulations, but had been a common practice for years and was known and tolerated by management. Maintenance work was being carried out on the main radar image processing system, which meant that the controllers were forced to use a fallback system.

The ground-based optical collision warning system, which would have alerted the controller to the pending collision about two minutes before it happened, had been switched off for maintenance. Nielsen was unaware of this. An aural short-term conflict alert warning system released a warning addressed to workstation RE SUED at 23:35:00 (32 seconds before the collision). This warning was not heard by anyone present at that time, although no error in this system could be found in a subsequent technical audit;  however, whether or not this audible warning is functional is not something that is technically logged. Even if Nielsen had heard this warning, at that time finding a useful resolution order by the ATC was impossible.

===Deviating statements in the official report===

All countries involved could add additional &quot;deviating&quot; statements to the official report. Bahrain, Switzerland, and Russia did submit positions that were published with the official report. The deviating statements were published verbatim as an appendix to the report by the BFU investigators.

The statement by Bahrain, the home country of the DHL plane, mostly agrees with the findings of the report. It says that the report should have put less emphasis on the actions of individuals and more on the faults within Skyguide&#x27;s organization and management. Bahrain&#x27;s statement also mentions the lack of crew resource management in the Tupolev&#x27;s cockpit as a factor in the crash.

Russia states that the Russian pilots were unable to obey the TCAS advisory to climb; the advisory was given when they were already at , while the controller wrongly stated conflicting traffic was above them at . Also, the ATC gave the wrong position of the DHL plane (2 o&#x27;clock instead of the actual 10 o&#x27;clock). Russia asserts that the DHL crew had a &quot;real possibility&quot; to avoid a collision, since they were able to hear the conversation between the Russian crew and the controller.

Switzerland notes that the Tupolev was about below the flight level ordered by the Swiss controller, and still descending at . The Swiss say that this was also a cause of the accident. Switzerland also requested that the BFU make a formal finding that the TCAS advisories would have been useful if obeyed immediately; the BFU declined to do so.

== Aftermath ==
Nielsen needed medical attention due to traumatic stress caused by the accident. At Skyguide, his former colleagues maintained a vase with a white rose over Nielsen&#x27;s former workstation. Skyguide, after initially having blamed the Russian pilot for the accident, accepted full responsibility and asked relatives of the victims for forgiveness.

The Broken Pearl Necklace memorial was built in memory of the incident.

Skyguide paid compensation to the families of the dead children; the compensation amount was about 36,000 at the time). The Swiss Federal Court turned down appeals from some relatives for higher compensation in 2011.

On 27 July 2006, a court in Konstanz decided that Germany should pay compensation to Bashkirian Airlines. The court found that Germany was legally responsible for the actions of Skyguide. The government appealed the ruling, but in late 2013, Bashkirian Airlines and Germany reached a tacit agreement, ending the court case before a decision on the legal issues was reached.

In another case before the court in Konstanz, Skyguide&#x27;s liability insurance is suing Bashkirian Airlines for 2.5 million euro in damages. The case was opened in March 2008; the legal questions are expected to be difficult, as the airline has filed for bankruptcy under Russian law.A criminal investigation of Skyguide began in May 2004. On 7 August 2006, a Swiss prosecutor filed manslaughter charges against eight employees of Skyguide. The prosecutor called for prison terms up to 15 months if found guilty. The verdict was announced in September 2007. Three of the four managers convicted were given suspended prison terms and the fourth was ordered to pay a fine. Another four Skyguide employees were cleared of any wrongdoing.

=== Murder of Peter Nielsen ===
Devastated by the death of his wife and two children aboard flight 2937, Vitaly Kaloyev, a Russian architect, held Peter Nielsen personally responsible for their deaths. He tracked down and stabbed Nielsen to death, in the presence of Nielsen&#x27;s wife and three children, at his home in Kloten, near Zürich, on 24 February 2004. The Swiss police arrested Kaloyev at a local motel shortly afterward, and in 2005, he was sentenced to eight years for manslaughter. However, his sentence was later reduced after a Swiss judge ruled that he had acted with diminished responsibility.

He was released in November 2007, having spent three and a half years in prison, because his mental condition was not sufficiently considered in the initial sentence. In January 2008, he was appointed deputy construction minister of North Ossetia. Kaloyev was treated as a hero back home at Vladikavkaz, and expressed no regret for his actions, instead blaming the victim for his own death. In 2016, Kaloyev was awarded the highest state medal by the government, the medal &quot;To the Glory of Ossetia&quot;. The medal is awarded for the highest achievements, improving the living conditions of the inhabitants of the region, educating the younger generation, and maintaining law and order.

==TCAS and conflicting orders==
The accident raised questions as to how pilots must react when they receive conflicting orders from TCAS and ATC. TCAS was a relatively new technology at the time of the accident, having been mandatory in Europe since 2000. When TCAS issues a resolution advisory (RA), the pilot flying should respond immediately by directing attention to RA displays and maneuvering as indicated, unless doing so would jeopardise the safe operation of the flight, or unless the flight crew can assure separation with the help of definitive visual acquisition of the aircraft causing the RA.

In responding to a TCAS RA that directs a deviation from assigned altitude, the flight crew should communicate with ATC as soon as practicable after responding to the RA. When the RA is removed, the flight crew should advise ATC that they are returning to their previously assigned clearance or should acknowledge any amended clearance issued.

While TCAS is programmed to assume that both crews will promptly follow the system&#x27;s instructions, the operations manual did not clearly state that TCAS should always take precedence over any ATC commands. The manual described TCAS as &quot;a backup to the ATC system&quot;, which could be wrongly interpreted to mean that ATC instructions have higher priority. This ambiguity was replicated in the Tu-154 Flight Operations Manual, which contained contradictory sections. On the one hand, chapter 8.18.3.4 emphasised the role of ATC and describes TCAS as an &quot;additional aid&quot;, while chapter 8.18.3.2 forbade manoeuvres contrary to TCAS. The BFU recommended that this ambiguity should be resolved in favor of obeying TCAS advisories even when these were in conflict with ATC instructions.

===Prior incident===
About a year before the incident, another incident had occurred involving confusion between conflicting TCAS and ATC commands. In 2001, two Japanese airliners nearly collided with each other in Japanese airspace. One of the aircraft had received conflicting orders from TCAS and ATC; one pilot followed the instructions of TCAS, while the other did not. A collision was only averted because one of the pilots made evasive manoeuvres based on a visual judgment. The aircraft missed each other by about , and the abrupt maneuver necessary to avert disaster left 100 occupants injured on one aircraft, some seriously. Japan published its report 11 days after the Überlingen accident, in it calling on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to make it clear that TCAS advisories should always take precedence over ATC instructions. ICAO accepted this recommendation and amended its regulations in November 2003.

===Technical solutions===
Before this accident, a change proposal (CP 112) for the TCAS II system had been issued. This proposal would have created a &quot;reversal&quot; of the original warning – asking the DHL plane to climb and the Tupolev crew to descend. According to an analysis by Eurocontrol, this would have avoided the collision if the DHL crew had received and followed the new instructions and the Tupolev had continued to descend. All TCAS II equipped aircraft have been upgraded to support RA reversal.

Additionally, an automatic downlink for TCAS, which would have alerted the controller that a TCAS advisory had been issued to the aircraft under their control, and notified them of the nature of that advisory, had not been deployed worldwide at the time of the accident.

===Recommendations after the accident===
The investigation report contains a number of recommendations concerning TCAS, calling for upgrades, better training and clearer instructions to the pilots. The TCAS II system was redesigned, with its ambiguous &quot;Adjust Vertical Speed&quot; RA voice command changed to &quot;Level-Off&quot;, to increase proper responses from pilots.

==In media==
===Films===
*The crash and the subsequent killing of the ATC were used as the basis of a motion picture produced by German and Swiss TV stations SWR and SF, called &quot;Flug in die Nacht – Das Unglück von Überlingen &quot;(&quot;Flight into the Night – the Accident at Überlingen&quot;) (2009), starring Ken Duken as Nielsen and Evgeni Sitochin as Kaloyev.
*The U.S. film &quot;Aftermath&quot; (2017) is loosely based on the Überlingen midair collision, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a character largely based on Kaloyev.
* The Russian film &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (2018) is based on the Überlingen midair collision, with Dmitry Nagiyev portraying Kaloyev.

===Music===
* &quot;Ballad of Vitaly&quot;, the closing track on the U.S. rock band Delta Spirit&#x27;s album &quot;History from Below&quot; (2010), recounts the story of the midair collision and Vitaly Kaloyev&#x27;s actions following the crash.
* The German futurepop band Edge of Dawn alludes to Kaloyev&#x27;s story and mentions his name in the song &quot;The Flight (Lux)&quot;, which appears on their EP &quot;The Flight&quot; (2005) and their full-length album &quot;Enjoy the Fall&quot; (2007).
* Russian rock-band &quot;Year of Snake&quot; has created a song &quot;2000 bucks for a cigarette&quot; about unrelated topics: friendship, treachery, love and smoking addiction. Later the band lead Alexei Markovnikov has repurposed some lyrics of the song to create an eponymous air traffic control themed power ballad loosely-based on the accident. The ballad was published using the name of a non-existing rock band &quot;Air traffic controllers&quot;. The song text is of the second controller going smoking due to severe smoking addiction, irresponsibly leaving another one to work alone for some time.

===Podcasts===
* On 3 and 10 February 2019, &quot;Casefile True Crime Podcast&quot;: &quot;Peter Nielsen&quot;, Case 106 (Parts 1 and 2) covered the story of the mid-air collision and subsequent killing of the former Skyguide controller Peter Nielsen, by Russian architect Vitaly Kaloyev.
* On 12 January 2021, the Hard Landings podcast covered the story in Episode 64: The Überlingen Mid-air Collision.
* On 5 May 2022, the Rooster Teeth Black Box Down podcast covered the story in Episode Season 3, episode 17: Accident Ends in Murder / Accident Ends in Murder / The Überlingen Mid-air Collision 

===Television===
* The collision featured in multiple segments of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot;:
**&quot;Deadly Crossroads&quot;, a season-two (2005) (called &quot;Air Emergency&quot; and &quot;Air Disasters&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the UK and elsewhere around the world). The dramatisation was broadcast in the United States with the title &quot;A Father&#x27;s Revenge&quot;; and with the title &quot;Mid-Air Collision&quot; in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Asia. Kaloyev was played by actor Kresimir Bosiljevac, while Nielsen was played by actor Stephen Sparks .
**It&#x27;s also set for a remake in the series&#x27;s twenty-fifth season titled &quot;Collision Catastrophe&quot;.
**The flight was also included in a &quot;Mayday&quot; season-eight (2009) &quot;Science of Disaster&quot; special titled &quot;System Breakdown&quot;, which looked at the role of air traffic controllers in aviation disasters.
*The National Geographic Channel documentary series &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; featured this midair collision in the episode entitled &quot;Collision at 35,000 feet&quot;, released on 26 September 2011.
*The episode is dramatized in the episode &quot;Fatal Flaws&quot; of &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;.

===Theatre===
In the U.S. off-Broadway play &quot;My Eyes Went Dark&quot;, which opened 7 June 2017 and closed 2 July, playwright and director Matthew Wilkinson tells Kaloyev&#x27;s story, which featured, among other characters, Declan Conlon as Kaloyev and Thusitha Jayasundera as his wife. It played at 59E59 Theaters in New York City.

<text>Celebrations is a miniature chocolate bar collection made by Mars, Incorporated, launched in 1997. It comprises miniature versions of full size Mars brands. Celebrations have the tagline &quot;Share the joy&quot;, and were one of the first mixed box of chocolates in the United Kingdom to bring together confectionery which had been already released in one box or tin instead of introducing new, especially-created confectionery made exclusively for the UK market, by a major producer.
Celebrations boxes are now sold in multiple countries which tend to have the same brands as the UK (Galaxy goes under Dove in most countries), but do differ in some circumstances. For example, Twix are not available in Celebrations boxes purchased in Australia.

==Contents==

* Maltesers Teaser
* Mars 
* Milky Way
* Snickers 
* Galaxy/Dove
* Galaxy Caramel
* Twix (1997–2006, 2011–) 
* Bounty
The selection sold in the United Kingdom also previously had:

* Galaxy Truffle (1997–2011)
* Topic (1997–2006)

In some countries, the Milky Way Bar has been replaced, or is under limited edition. In these countries, it is usually replaced with Milky Way crispy rolls, which was introduced in 2017.

In the United States version, Milky Way and Galaxy were replaced with the American versions, and Maltesers Teasers is not a part of the selection.

On 3 November 2022 it was announced that Bounty bars would be removed from some labeled tubs in the UK after the manufacturers found that 40% of people hated them. A limited run of &quot;No Bounty&quot; tubs would be available, at 40 Tesco stores, in the weeks before Christmas. But a final decision had not been made after 18% of people named the Bounty as their favourite.

<doc id="562875" wikidata="Q701764" url="?curid=562875" title="Nagakura Shinpachi">
<text>was the captain of the 2nd troop of the Shinsengumi, He was later known as during the Meiji era.

==History==
===Early life===
Nagakura Shinpachi Noriyuki, known as Eikichi or Eiji during his childhood, was born in the Matsumae clan&#x27;s &quot;kami-yashiki&quot; (upper residence) in Edo on the 11th day of the fourth month of Tenpō 10 (May 23, 1839). His father, Nagakura Kanji, was a retainer of the Matsumae clan, with a 150 koku stipend. Like Okita Sōji, Nagakura was a true product of the Edo period — being a son of a retainer (of a domain he had never seen), who had lived in Edo his entire life.

Nagakura&#x27;s father spelled the family name with the &quot;naga&quot; meaning &quot;long&quot;, but Nagakura later spelled it with the &quot;naga&quot; meaning &quot;eternity&quot;. At eight, Nagakura entered Okada Juusuke Toshisada&#x27;s Shindō Munen-ryū dojo; at age eighteen he reached mokuroku (6th dan), and received the menkyo kaiden certification. At age nineteen he left the service of the Matsumae clan in order to travel and improve his technique. He spent some time at Yurimoto Shuuzou&#x27;s Shintō Munen Ryu dojo. Nagakura also spent time at Tsubouchi Shume&#x27;s Shingyoto Ryu dojo, where he met Shimada Kai, the future vice-captain of the Shinsengumi 2nd unit. Around 1861, he started &quot;taking his meals&quot; at Kondō Isami&#x27;s Shieikan.

===Rōshigumi===
In 1863 (Bunkyū 3), Nagakura and Kondō joined the Rōshigumi. Upon arrival in Kyoto however, the Rōshigumi was immediately disbanded. While most of the Rōshigumi returned to Edo, Nagakura, Kondō, Hijikata Toshizō, Serizawa Kamo were among nineteen Roshigumi members stayed behind in Kyoto.

===Shinsengumi ===
The &quot;Mibu Rōshigumi&quot; was formed by the Kyoto Shugoshoku (&quot;Kyoto Protector&quot;) Matsudaira Higo no Kami (Katamori, of Aizu), and headed by Kondō and Serizawa.

After the events of the 18th day of the 8th month (September 18, 1863), the group became known as &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;. Nagakura became a fukuchou jokin (assistant vice commander) in 1863.

On July 8, 1864, during the Ikedaya incident, Nagakura was one of ten members which included Okita Sōji, Tōdō Heisuke, and Kondō being the leader of the first group to raid inside the Ikedaya Inn, he later suffered a deep wound on his left thumb and his sword was broken during the battle. A month later on August 20, 1864, he was also involved in the Kinmon incident along with Kondō, Okita and several others to suppress the Chōshū rebellion at the Hamaguri Gate of the Imperial Palace.

He then became the captain of the 2nd unit in 1865. Together with the rest of the Shinsengumi, he became a &quot;hatamoto&quot; in June 1867.

On December 13, 1867, Nagakura was involved with Harada Sanosuke and several other Shinsengumi members during the Aburanokōji incident with the ambush of Itō Kashitarō&#x27;s Goryō Eji Kōdai-ji faction, which consisted of a small group of Shinsengumi defectors. Seven of these defectors were trying to retrieve Itō&#x27;s body, who was assassinated earlier and left at the crossroad of Aburanokōji-Shichijō as a trap. Three of them had been assassinated during the ambush, while the remaining four fled.

Nagakura had a daughter with a geisha from Shimabara Kameya in Kyoto known only by her stage name as , who died after her birth in December 1867. Due to the approaching Boshin War, Nagakura was not able to attend to her burial. Fortunately he managed to arrange for his infant daughter to be brought up by Kotsune&#x27;s sister, who lived in a village of Fudoson not far from Kyoto. Assumed that he would never see his daughter again, Nagakura gave the family 50 ryo to cover the child expenses.

===Boshin war===
On January 27, 1868, in the Battle of Toba–Fushimi in Kyoto, Nagakura shown his courage by leading the members of a suicide squad and charging with a sword towards the bullet-firing Imperial Army.

Right after the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma in April 1868, Nagukura and Harada Sanosuke left the Kōyō Chinbutai (the renamed Shinsengumi) after disagreements with long-time comrades Kondo and Hijikata. According to Nagakura, Kondō wanted the surviving men to become his retainers; Nagakura, Harada, and a few others staunchly refused. Nagakura and Harada, taking with them some other members, joined with a group of former Tokugawa retainers with Haga Gidou being one of them to form a new unit, the Seiheitai. Nagakura and the Seiheitai unit left Edo shortly after Edo Castle&#x27;s surrender, and participated in some battles against the Imperial forces in the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle and at Imaichi and headed north, hoped to take part in the fighting that was moving northward, toward Aizu. But upon receiving news of the surrender of the Aizu Domain, Nagakura and the unit returned to Edo.

===Meiji Restoration===
While in Edo, he had to hide for a while because he had fought against the Imperial forces and would turn himself in to the senior councilor Shimokuni Toshichiro of the Matsumae clan and served as an infantry instructor and was stipended at his father&#x27;s original rate of 150 koku.

However, he would often run into Suzuki Mikisaburō, the younger brother of deceased Itō Kashitarō and one of the four Shinsengumi defectors who narrowly escaped from the assassination attempt during the Aburanokōji incident back then in December 1867. Due to his involvement in that incident and suspecting that Suzuki was trying to kill him, Nagakura returned to Matsumae, Hokkaido in late 1868 (Meiji 1).

In 1871 (Meiji 4), Nagakura married , daughter of the physician (). In 1873 (Meiji 6), he was adopted into his wife&#x27;s family and changed his name first to , and later . Their only son, was born on February 24, 1873.

Later in 1875, Sugimura Yoshie, with the help of the physician Matsumoto Ryōjun and several surviving former Shinsengumi comrades including Fujita Gorō (formerly Saitō Hajime) among others, erected the monument known as the &quot;Grave of Shinsengumi&quot; for Kondō Isami, Hijikata Toshizō, and the fallen comrades of the Shinsengumi at Jutoku-ji temple boundary in Itabashi, Tokyo and held requiems for their past comrades&#x27; souls.

In 1882 (Meiji 15), Sugimura moved his family to Otaru, Hokkaido, and was invited by the police bureaucrat Tsukigata Kiyoshi to work as kenjutsu teacher to train the prison guards in Kabato prison for four years. Following his retirement in 1886 (Meiji 19), he opened a dojo to teach kendo at Asakusa, Taitō, Tokyo. Sugimura later moved back to Otaru in 1889 (Meiji 22) when his wife and son opened a pharmacy there.

In 1900 (Meiji 33), Sugimura was on his way to attend the funeral of his former Shinsengumi comrade Shimada Kai in Kyoto, he was reunited with his daughter Isoko there, who had become a well-known geisha actress of the Kansai region under the stage name . Following their reunion, Sugimura and Isoko would never meet again. Isoko was later adopted into the Okada family and took the name of .

In 1905 (Meiji 38), Sugimura moved again and lived at Midori 1-chome near the Otaru Juvenile Science Museum. Sugimura&#x27;s geisha daughter Isoko died on December 21, 1905, at the age of 39. In late July 1909 (Meiji 42), he moved again to Hanazono, Otaru, where he taught kendo at the club of the Tohoku Imperial University&#x27;s Faculty of Agricultural (present day location of Hokkaido University).

In 1911 (Meiji 44), he gave an oral background of the Shinsengumi to a journalist for a newspaper. It is believed that since the reports were given half a century after the events, the accounts were more for pleasing crowds than a faithful record. Sugimura did however, write his memoirs that can testify first hand to the bloody lifetime of the Shinsengumi. He had lent his written memoirs to an acquaintance long before his newspaper interview, but the memoirs were never returned to him. Sugimura Yoshie&#x27;s memoirs were lost for decades before being found in 1998 and was published in book form.

==Death==
Sugimura Yoshie died of periostitis caused by caries and sepsis on January 5, 1915 (Taisho 4). He was seventy-six. His last words was &quot;&quot;. Upon his will, he was buried at the Grave of Shinsengumi, Itabashi, Tokyo. Coincidentally, later in this same year, Fujita Gorō died at the age of seventy-two from a stomach ulcer on September 28.

==Nagakura in Fiction==
Accounts of Nagakura&#x27;s time before and during his Shinsengumi period appear in novels, period dramas and anime/manga series.

Nagakura is featured in &quot;Peacemaker Kurogane&quot; (anime/manga), &quot;Hakodate Youjin Buraichou Himegami&quot; (manga), &quot;Kaze Hikaru&quot; (manga), &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Hokkaido Arc&quot; (manga), &quot;Getsumei Seiki&quot; (manga), Golden Kamuy (anime/manga), 2004 NHK Taiga drama series &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot;, &quot;Shinsengumi Gunrou-den&quot; (video game series), &quot;Hakuouki&quot; (video game series and 2010 anime), &quot;Bakumatsu Renka Shinsengumi&quot; (video game series), and &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;. Shimura Shinpachi from the manga/anime &quot;Gintama&quot; is loosely based on Nagakura.

Nagakura is prominently featured in the 2014 historical fiction &quot;The Soldier and the Samurai&quot;.()

Nagakura is portrayed in the 2014 video game &quot;Ryu Ga Gotoku Ishin!&quot;, a spinoff of the &quot;Yakuza&quot; franchise, and its 2023 remaster. He shares his appearance and voice with series regular Taiga Saejima.

<doc id="562879" wikidata="Q2318908" url="?curid=562879" title="Glasgow Haskell Compiler">
<text>The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) is a native or machine code compiler for the functional programming language Haskell. It provides a cross-platform software environment for writing and testing Haskell code and supports many extensions, libraries, and optimisations that streamline the process of generating and executing code. GHC is the most commonly used Haskell compiler. It is free and open-source software released under a BSD license.

==History==
GHC originally begun in 1989 as a prototype, written in Lazy ML (LML) by Kevin Hammond at the University of Glasgow. Later that year, the prototype was completely rewritten in Haskell, except for its parser, by Cordelia Hall, Will Partain, and Simon Peyton Jones. Its first beta release was on 1 April 1991. Later releases added a strictness analyzer and language extensions such as monadic I/O, mutable arrays, unboxed data types, concurrent and parallel programming models (such as software transactional memory and data parallelism) and a profiler.

Peyton Jones, and Marlow, later moved to Microsoft Research in Cambridge, where they continued to be primarily responsible for developing GHC. GHC also contains code from more than three hundred other contributors.
From 2009 to about 2014, third-party contributions to GHC were funded by the Industrial Haskell Group.

===GHC names===
Since early releases the official website has referred to GHC as &quot;The Glasgow Haskell Compiler&quot;, whereas in the executable version command it is identified as &quot;The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System&quot;. This has been reflected in the documentation. Initially, it had the internal name of &quot;The Glamorous Glasgow Haskell Compiler&quot;.

==Architecture==
GHC is written in Haskell, but the runtime system for Haskell, essential to run programs, is written in C and C--.

GHC&#x27;s front end, incorporating the lexer, parser and typechecker, is designed to preserve as much information about the source language as possible until after type inference is complete, toward the goal of providing clear error messages to users. After type checking, the Haskell code is desugared into a typed intermediate language known as &quot;Core&quot; (based on System F, extended with codice_1 and codice_2 expressions). Core has been extended to support generalized algebraic datatypes in its type system, and is now based on an extension to System F known as System FC.

In the tradition of type-directed compiling, GHC&#x27;s simplifier, or &quot;middle end&quot;, where most of the optimizations implemented in GHC are performed, is structured as a series of source-to-source transformations on Core code. The analyses and transformations performed in this compiler stage include demand analysis (a generalization of strictness analysis), application of user-defined rewrite rules (including a set of rules included in GHC&#x27;s standard libraries that performs foldr/build fusion), unfolding (called &quot;inlining&quot; in more traditional compilers), let-floating, an analysis that determines which function arguments can be unboxed, constructed product result analysis, specialization of overloaded functions, and a set of simpler local transformations such as constant folding and beta reduction.

The back end of the compiler transforms Core code into an internal representation of C--, via an intermediate language STG (short for &quot;Spineless Tagless G-machine&quot;). The C-- code can then take one of three routes: it is either printed as C code for compilation with GCC, converted directly into native machine code (the traditional &quot;code generation&quot; phase), or converted to LLVM IR for compilation with LLVM. In all three cases, the resultant native code is finally linked against the GHC runtime system to produce an executable.

==Language==
GHC complies with the language standards, both &quot;Haskell 98&quot; and &quot;Haskell 2010&quot;.
It also supports many optional extensions to the Haskell standard: for example, the software transactional memory (STM) library, which allows for Composable Memory Transactions.

===Extensions to Haskell===
Many extensions to Haskell have been proposed. These provide features not described in the language specification, or they redefine existing constructs. As such, each extension may not be supported by all Haskell implementations. There is an ongoing effort to describe extensions and select those which will be included in future versions of the language specification.

The extensions supported by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler include:
* Unboxed types and operations. These represent the primitive datatypes of the underlying hardware, without the indirection of a pointer to the heap or the possibility of deferred evaluation. Numerically intensive code can be significantly faster when coded using these types.
* The ability to specify strict evaluation for a value, pattern binding, or datatype field.
* More convenient syntax for working with modules, patterns, list comprehensions, operators, records, and tuples.
* Syntactic sugar for computing with arrows and recursively-defined monadic values. Both of these concepts extend the monadic -notation provided in standard Haskell.
* A significantly more powerful system of types and typeclasses, described below.
* Template Haskell, a system for compile-time metaprogramming. Expressions can be written to produce Haskell code in the form of an abstract syntax tree. These expressions are typechecked and evaluated at compile time; the generated code is then included as if it were part of the original code. Together with the ability to reflect on definitions, this provides a powerful tool for further extensions to the language.
* Quasi-quotation, which allows the user to define new concrete syntax for expressions and patterns. Quasi-quotation is useful when a metaprogram written in Haskell manipulates code written in a language other than Haskell.
* Generic typeclasses, which specify functions solely in terms of the algebraic structure of the types they operate on.
* Parallel evaluation of expressions using multiple CPU cores. This does &quot;not&quot; require explicitly spawning threads. The distribution of work happens implicitly, based on annotations provided in the program.
* Compiler pragmas for directing optimizations such as inline expansion and specializing functions for particular types.
* Customizable rewrite rules are rules describing how to replace one expression with an equivalent, but more efficiently evaluated expression. These are used within core data structure libraries to improve performance throughout application-level code.
* Record dot syntax. Provides syntactic sugar for accessing the fields of a (potentially nested) record which is similar to the syntax of many other programming languages.

===Type system extensions===
An expressive static type system is one of the major defining features of Haskell. Accordingly, much of the work in extending the language has been directed towards data types and type classes.

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler supports an extended type system based on the theoretical System FC. Major extensions to the type system include:
* Arbitrary-rank and impredicative polymorphism. Essentially, a polymorphic function or datatype constructor may require that one of its arguments is also polymorphic.
* Generalized algebraic data types. Each constructor of a polymorphic datatype can encode information into the resulting type. A function which pattern-matches on this type can use the per-constructor type information to perform more specific operations on data.
* Existential types. These can be used to &quot;bundle&quot; some data together with operations on that data, in such a way that the operations can be used without exposing the specific type of the underlying data. Such a value is very similar to an object as found in object-oriented programming languages.
* Data types that do not actually contain any values. These can be useful to represent data in type-level metaprogramming.
* Type families: user-defined functions from types to types. Whereas parametric polymorphism provides the same structure for every type instantiation, type families provide &quot;ad hoc&quot; polymorphism with implementations that can differ between instantiations. Use cases include content-aware optimizing containers and type-level metaprogramming.
* Implicit function parameters that have dynamic scope. These are represented in types in much the same way as type class constraints.
* Linear types (GHC 9.0)

Extensions relating to type classes include:
* A type class may be parametrized on more than one type. Thus a type class can describe not only a set of types, but an &quot;n&quot;-ary relation on types.
* Functional dependencies, which constrain parts of that relation to be a mathematical function on types. That is, the constraint specifies that some type class parameter is completely determined once some other set of parameters is fixed. This guides the process of type inference in situations where otherwise there would be ambiguity.
* Significantly relaxed rules regarding the allowable shape of type class instances. When these are enabled in full, the type class system becomes a Turing-complete language for logic programming at compile time.
* Type families, as described above, may also be associated with a type class.
* The automatic generation of certain type class instances is extended in several ways. New type classes for generic programming and common recursion patterns are supported. Also, when a new type is declared as isomorphic to an existing type, any type class instance declared for the underlying type may be lifted to the new type &quot;for free&quot;.

==Portability==
Versions of GHC are available for several system or computing platform, including Windows and most varieties of Unix (such as Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and macOS). GHC has also been ported to several different processor architectures.

<doc id="562883" wikidata="Q1644136" url="?curid=562883" title="Higher-order logic">
<text>In mathematics and logic, a higher-order logic (abbreviated HOL) is a form of logic that is distinguished from first-order logic by additional quantifiers and, sometimes, stronger semantics. Higher-order logics with their standard semantics are more expressive, but their model-theoretic properties are less well-behaved than those of first-order logic.

The term &quot;higher-order logic&quot; is commonly used to mean higher-order simple predicate logic. Here &quot;simple&quot; indicates that the underlying type theory is the &quot;theory of simple types&quot;, also called the &quot;simple theory of types&quot;. Leon Chwistek and Frank P. Ramsey proposed this as a simplification of &quot;ramified theory of types&quot; specified in the &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. &quot;Simple types&quot; is sometimes also meant to exclude polymorphic and dependent types.

== Quantification scope ==
First-order logic quantifies only variables that range over individuals; &quot;second-order logic&quot;, also quantifies over sets; &quot;third-order logic&quot; also quantifies over sets of sets, and so on. 

&quot;Higher-order logic&quot; is the union of first-, second-, third-, ..., &quot;n&quot;th-order logic; &quot;i.e.,&quot; higher-order logic admits quantification over sets that are nested arbitrarily deeply.

== Semantics ==
There are two possible semantics for higher-order logic.

In the &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;full semantics&quot;, quantifiers over higher-type objects range over &quot;all&quot; possible objects of that type. For example, a quantifier over sets of individuals ranges over the entire powerset of the set of individuals. Thus, in standard semantics, once the set of individuals is specified, this is enough to specify all the quantifiers. HOL with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, HOL admits categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers, and of the real numbers, which are impossible with first-order logic. However, by a result of Kurt Gödel, HOL with standard semantics does not admit an effective, sound, and complete proof calculus. The model-theoretic properties of HOL with standard semantics are also more complex than those of first-order logic. For example, the Löwenheim number of second-order logic is already larger than the first measurable cardinal, if such a cardinal exists. The Löwenheim number of first-order logic, in contrast, is ℵ0, the smallest infinite cardinal. 

In Henkin semantics, a separate domain is included in each interpretation for each higher-order type. Thus, for example, quantifiers over sets of individuals may range over only a subset of the powerset of the set of individuals. HOL with these semantics is equivalent to many-sorted first-order logic, rather than being stronger than first-order logic. In particular, HOL with Henkin semantics has all the model-theoretic properties of first-order logic, and has a complete, sound, effective proof system inherited from first-order logic.

== Properties ==
Higher-order logics include the offshoots of Church&#x27;s simple theory of types and the various forms of intuitionistic type theory. Gérard Huet has shown that unifiability is undecidable in a type-theoretic flavor of third-order logic, that is, there can be no algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary equation between second-order (let alone arbitrary higher-order) terms has a solution.

Up to a certain notion of isomorphism, the powerset operation is definable in second-order logic. Using this observation, Jaakko Hintikka established in 1955 that second-order logic can simulate higher-order logics in the sense that for every formula of a higher-order logic, one can find an equisatisfiable formula for it in second-order logic.

The term &quot;higher-order logic&quot; is assumed in some context to refer to &quot;classical&quot; higher-order logic. However, modal higher-order logic has been studied as well. According to several logicians, Gödel&#x27;s ontological proof is best studied (from a technical perspective) in such a context.

<text>Victor Henry Grinich (November 26, 1924 – November 5, 2000) was a pioneer in the semiconductor industry and a member of the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; that founded Fairchild Semiconductor in Silicon Valley.

==Early life and education==
Born to Croatian immigrant parents, his original surname was Grgurinovic. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, he served in the United States Navy during World War II. To make his last name easier to pronounce during military roll calls, he officially changed it to &quot;Grinich&quot;.

Grinich received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Washington in 1946 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1949, and then earned a Ph.D. in 1951 from Stanford University.

==Career==
Initially a researcher at SRI International, he worked at the seminal Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory of Beckman Instruments, and then left with other disgruntled members of the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; to create the influential Fairchild Semiconductor corporation.

Among the physicists, mathematicians and metallurgists in the group, Grinich was the only electrical engineer.

Grinich left Fairchild in 1968 to study computer science while teaching electrical engineering at UC Berkeley. He later taught at Stanford University as well. In 1975, he published a textbook, &quot;Introduction to Integrated Circuits&quot;.

In 1978, he was appointed chief executive officer of Identronix, a company that pioneered Radio-frequency identification systems, which are now used extensively in anti-theft tags. In 1985, Grinich founded and became CEO of Escort Memory Systems to commercialize RFID tags for industrial applications. EMS was acquired by Datalogic in 1989.

In 1993, he co-founded Arkos Design, a manufacturer of emulators. The company was acquired by Synopsys in 1995. Grinich retired in 1997 and died of prostate cancer in 2000, at age 75.

<doc id="562890" wikidata="Q2007821" url="?curid=562890" title="Parathyroid hormone-related protein">
<text>Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is a proteinaceous hormone and a member of the parathyroid hormone family secreted by mesenchymal stem cells. It is occasionally secreted by cancer cells (for example, breast cancer, certain types of lung cancer including squamous-cell lung carcinoma). However, it also has normal functions in bone, teeth, vascular tissues and other tissues.

== Function ==

PTHrP acts as an endocrine, autocrine, paracrine, and intracrine hormone. It regulates endochondral bone development by maintaining the endochondral growth plate at a constant width. It also regulates epithelial–mesenchymal interactions during the formation of the mammary glands. PTHrP plays a major role in regulating calcium homeostasis in vertebrates, including sea bream, chick, and mammals.

In 2005, Australian pathologist and researcher Thomas John Martin found that PTHrP produced by osteoblasts is a physiological regulator of bone formation. Martin and Miao &quot;et al.&quot; demonstrated that osteoblast-specific ablation of PTHrP in mice results in osteoporosis and impaired bone formation both in vivo and ex vivo, which reiterates the phenotype of mice with haploinsufficiency of PTHrP. By these findings, they demonstrated that PTHrP plays a central role in physiological regulation of bone formation by promoting recruitment and survival of osteoblasts. It may also play a role in physiological regulation of bone resorption by enhancing osteoclast formation.

=== Tooth eruption ===

PTHrP is critical in intraosseous phase of tooth eruption where it acts as a signalling molecule to stimulate local bone resorption. Without PTHrP, the bony crypt surrounding the tooth follicle will not resorb, and therefore the tooth will not erupt. In the context of tooth eruption, PTHrP is secreted by the cells of the reduced enamel epithelium.

===Mammary glands===

It aids in normal mammary gland development. It is necessary for maintenance of the mammary bud cells. Loss of PTHrP or its receptor causes the mammary bud cells to change back into epidermal cells. In lactation, it may regulate the mobilization and transfer of calcium to the milk in conjunction with the calcium sensing receptors, as well as placental transfer of calcium.

=== Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy ===
PTHrP is related in function to parathyroid hormone(PTH). When a tumor secretes PTHrP, this can lead to hypercalcemia. As this is sometimes the first sign of the malignancy, hypercalcemia caused by PTHrP is considered a paraneoplastic phenomenon. PTHrP is responsible for most cases of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.

PTHrP shares the same N-terminal end as parathyroid hormone and therefore it can bind to the same receptor, the Type I PTH receptor (PTHR1). PTHrP can simulate most of the actions of PTH including increases in bone resorption and distal tubular calcium reabsorption, and inhibition of proximal tubular phosphate transport. PTHrP lacks the normal feedback inhibition as PTH.

However, PTHrP has a less sustained action than PTH on PTHR1 activation, which may explain at least in part its reduced ability to stimulate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2 vitamin D) production and indirectly intestinal calcium absorption through an action to increase circulating levels of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D.

=== Growth Plate ===

PTHrP is found in the proliferative zone of the growth plate. It is one of the main proteins that regulates mesenchymal stem cell activity. Current research suggests that PTHrP promotes the proliferation of early-phase chondrocytes and inhibits their differentiation into hypertropic chondrocytes. It is involved in a negative feedback loop with Indian Hedgehog (Ihh). 

== Genetics ==

Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding two distinct isoforms have been observed. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from non-AUG (CUG and GUG) start sites, in-frame and downstream of the initiator AUG codon, to give rise to nuclear forms of this hormone.

== Discovery ==

The protein was first isolated in 1987 by Thomas J. Martin&#x27;s team at the University of Melbourne. Miao &quot;et al&quot;. showed that disruption of the &quot;PTHrP&quot; gene in mice caused a lethal phenotype and distinct bone abnormalities, suggesting that PTHrP has a physiological function.

== Interactions ==

Parathyroid hormone-related protein has been shown to interact with KPNB1 and Arrestin beta 1.

<text>Dolmabahçe Palace (, ) (Ottoman Turkish:سرایی دولمابغجہ) located in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul, Turkey, on the European coast of the Bosporus strait, served as the main administrative center of the Ottoman Empire from 1856 to 1887 and from 1909 to 1922 (Yıldız Palace was used in the interim period).

== History ==

Dolmabahçe Palace was ordered by the Empire&#x27;s 31st Sultan, Abdulmejid I, and built between the years 1843 and 1856. Previously, the Sultan and his family had lived at the Topkapı Palace, but as the medieval Topkapı was lacking in contemporary style, luxury, and comfort, as compared to the palaces of the European monarchs, Abdülmecid decided to build a new modern palace near the site of the former Beşiktaş Sahil Palace, which was demolished. Hacı Said Ağa was responsible for the construction works, while the project was realized by architects Garabet Balyan, his son Nigoğayos Balyan and Evanis Kalfa (members of the Armenian Balyan family of Ottoman court architects).

The construction cost five million Ottoman gold lira, or 35 tonnes of gold, the equivalent of ca. $1.9 billion in today&#x27;s (2021) gold values. This sum corresponded to approximately a quarter of the yearly tax revenue. Actually, the construction was financed through debasement, by massive issue of paper money, as well as by foreign loans. The huge expenses placed an enormous burden on the state purse and contributed to the deteriorating financial situation of the Ottoman Empire, which eventually defaulted on its public debt in October 1875, with the subsequent establishment in 1881 of financial control over the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; by the European powers.

The palace was home to six Sultans from 1856, when it was first inhabited, up until the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924: The last royal to live here was Caliph Abdülmecid Efendi. A law that went into effect on March 3, 1924, transferred the ownership of the palace to the national heritage of the new Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, used the palace as a presidential residence during the summers and enacted some of his most important works here. Atatürk spent the last days of his medical treatment in this palace, where he died on November 10, 1938.

Today, the palace is managed by &quot;Milli Saraylar Daire Başkanlığı&quot; (Directorate of National Palaces) responsible to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.

== Location ==
The site of Dolmabahçe was originally a bay on the Bosporus which was used for the anchorage of the Ottoman fleet. The area was reclaimed gradually during the 18th century to become an imperial garden, much appreciated by the Ottoman sultans; it is from this garden that the name &quot;Dolmabahçe&quot; (Filled-in Garden) comes from the Turkish &quot;dolma&quot; meaning &quot;filled&quot; and &quot;bahçe&quot; meaning &quot;garden.&quot; Various small summer palaces and wooden pavilions were built here during the 18th and 19th centuries ultimately forming a palace complex named Beşiktaş Waterfront Palace. The area of 110,000 m2 is confined by Bosporus on the east side, while a steep precipice bounds it on the west side, such that after the building of the new 45,000 m2 monoblock Dolmabahçe Palace a relatively limited space has remained for a garden complex which would normally surround such a palace.

== Design and layout ==
Dolmabahçe is the largest palace in Turkey. It has an area of , and contains 285 rooms, 46 halls, 6 baths (&quot;hamam&quot;) and 68 toilets.

The design contains eclectic elements from the Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical styles, blended with traditional Ottoman architecture to create a new synthesis. The palace layout and décor reflect the increasing influence of European styles and standards on Ottoman culture and art during the Tanzimat period. The exterior, in particular the view from the Bosporus, shows a classical European two-wing arrangement which is divided by a big avant-corps with two side avant-corps.

Functionally, on the other hand, the palace retains elements of traditional Ottoman palace life, and also features of traditional Turkish homes. It is strictly separated structurally in a southern wing (&quot;Mabeyn-i Hümâyûn&quot;, or &quot;Selamlık&quot;, the quarters reserved for the men) which contains the public representation rooms, and a northern wing (&quot;Harem-i Hümâyûn&quot;, the Harem) serving as the private residential area for the Sultan and his family. The two functional areas are separated by the big Ceremonial Hall (&quot;Muayede Salonu&quot;) with a floor area of and a high dome. Since the harem had to be completely isolated from the outside world, the main entrance for the visitors is located on the narrow southern side. There, the representation rooms are arranged for receptions of visitors and of foreign diplomats. The harem area includes eight interconnected apartments for the wives of the sultan, for his favourites and concubines, and for his mother, each with its own bathroom.

== Décor and equipment ==


Whereas the Topkapı Palace has exquisite examples of Iznik tiles and Ottoman carving, the Dolmabahçe palace is extensively decorated with gold and crystal. Fourteen tonnes of gold were used to gild the ceilings. Over 100 kg of gold was used to decorate the palace, this weight today costs US$6 million.

The world&#x27;s largest crystal chandelier is in the Ceremonial Hall. It has 750 lamps and weighs 4.5 tonnes. The chandelier was originally assumed to have been a gift from Queen Victoria; in 2006, however, a receipt was discovered showing it had been paid for in full by the Sultan.

Dolmabahçe has the largest collection of Bohemian and Baccarat crystal chandeliers in the world. The famous &quot;Crystal Staircase&quot; has the shape of a double horseshoe and is built of Baccarat crystal, brass and mahogany.

Expensive stones such as Marmara (Proconnesian) marble, Egyptian alabaster (calcite, also known as onyx-marble), and Porphyry from Pergamon were used for the decoration.

The palace includes a large number of Hereke palace carpets made by the Hereke Imperial Factory. The Hereke carpet featured in the main hall happens to be the largest Hereke rug in the world. Also featured are 150-year-old bearskin rugs originally presented to the Sultan as a gift by Tsar Nicholas I.

A collection of 202 oil paintings is on display in the palace. A highlight of the collection are 23 paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky which he created as a court painter during his stays in Istanbul. The collection also includes paintings by Gustave Boulanger, Jean-Léon Gérôme, Eugène Fromentin, Stanisław Chlebowski, Félix Ziem, Karl Joseph Kuwasseg, Fausto Zonaro, Théo van Rysselberghe and Alexander Sandor Svoboda. There are also paintings by Turkish painters such as Osman Hamdi Bey, Halil Pasha and Osman Nuri Pasha in this art museum.

From the very beginning, the palace&#x27;s equipment implemented the highest technical standards. Gas lighting and water-closets were imported from Great Britain, whereas other palaces in continental Europe were still lacking these features at that time. Later, electricity, a central heating system and an elevator were installed.

== Rooms ==

=== Medhal (Main Entrance) Hall ===
A visit to the Dolmabahçe Palace begins at the Medhal Hall. Rooms leading off the Medhal are towards the sea and the land. The rooms facing the sea were used by the leading Ottoman officials, the Grand Vizier and the other state ministers, while the rooms facing the land were used by various administrators of the palace and the state, such as the Palace Marshall, Şeyhülislam, and members of the House of Representatives (&quot;Meclis-i Mebusan&quot;) and the Senate (&quot;Meclis-i Ayan&quot;).

Guests would first wait in this hall and then would be led inside at the proper time by a palace protocol officer. On entering the Medhal, one sees Boulle tables on both sides of the room, which bear the monogram of Sultan Abdülmecid on top. The royal monogram of the sultan is also on the fireplace. The English chandelier hanging in the middle of this room has sixty arms. The Hereke fabrics used as upholstery for the furniture and as draperies are in the royal shade of red.

=== The secretariat&#x27;s rooms ===
The second room after the Medhal to the right is the Clerk&#x27;s Hall, also referred to as the &quot;Tiled Room.&quot; The largest painting in the palace collection, a depiction of the Surre Procession by Stefano Ussi, hangs on the left wall of this hall. Surre was used to refer to the caravans which travelled from Istanbul to Mecca during the religious month of Recep, bearing the monetary aid used to support the maintenance and the decoration of the Kaaba and to provide financial assistance to the local population of Hejaz.

On the wall to the right is a painting signed by Rudolf Ernst depicting the fire at the Paris Municipal Theater and another painting of a Dutch Village Girl by Delandre. Decorated with French style furniture, this room also contains very valuable porcelain vases.

=== Atatürk&#x27;s room ===
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk spent the last days of his life in the palace as his health deteriorated. He died at 9:05 A.M. on November 10, 1938, in a bedroom located in the former harem area of the palace. All the clocks in the palace were stopped and set to 9:05 after his death. The clocks outside of his room now are set to the actual time in Turkey, but the clock in the room in which he died still points to 9:05.

=== Harem ===

The harem was a traditional feature of many Middle Eastern architectural structures throughout history. The point of Abdulmecid&#x27;s construction of the harem was to ensure there were separate quarters built for the royal family and their leisure. It was common practice for the Sultan&#x27;s personal concubines to reside within the harem. Rooms meant to house and educate the children of the Sultan as well as the Sultan&#x27;s own living quarters are included in what would be considered the harem.

Usually most Sultans beforehand had restricted their wives and concubines from being in the public, however Abdulmecid unprecedentedly allowed them to leave the palace to shops and bazaars under supervision.

== Adjacent buildings ==

A number of further residential buildings are located near the palace including the palace of the Crown Prince (&quot;Veliaht Dairesi&quot;), the quarters of the gentlemen-in-waiting (&quot;Musahiban Dairesi&quot;), the dormitories of the servants (&quot;Agavat Dairesi&quot;, &quot;Bendegan Dairesi&quot;) and of the guards (&quot;Baltacılar Dairesi&quot;), the quarters of the Chief Eunuch (&quot;Kızlarağası Dairesi&quot;). Further buildings include imperial kitchens (&quot;Matbah-i Amire&quot;), stables, an aviary (&quot;Kusluk&quot;), a plant nursery (&quot;Fidelik&quot;), a flour mill, a greenhouse (&quot;Sera&quot;), a Hereke carpet workshop (&quot;Hereke dökümhanesi&quot;), a glass manufactory, a foundry, a pharmacy etc.A baroque style mosque designed by Garabet Balyan was built near the palace in 1853–1855. It was commissioned by queen mother Bezm-i Âlem Valide Sultan. Since 1948 the building housed the Naval Museum, but the museum was moved to another location in 1960 after the coup d&#x27;état of May, 27th. In 1967, the mosque was returned for worship.

A clock tower (&quot;Dolmabahçe Saat Kulesi&quot;) was erected in front of the Imperial Gate (Saltanat Kapisi) on a square along the European waterfront of Bosporus next to the mosque. The tower was ordered by Sultan Abdülhamid II and designed by the court architect Sarkis Balyan between 1890 and 1895. Its clock was manufactured by the French clockmaker house of Jean-Paul Garnier, and installed by the court clock master Johann Mayer.

<text>Sir Denis Follows, CBE (13 April 1908 – 17 September 1983) was a British sports administrator. Between 1962 and 1973 he was Secretary of the Football Association (FA) and from 1977 was Chairman of the British Olympic Association. During his tenure as BOA Chairman, he was instrumental in ensuring that British competitors were able to choose whether or not to compete at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The BOA had come under government pressure to withdraw the team in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Follows led the party to Moscow as Team Commandant.

Follows was educated at the universities of London and Nottingham, and was President of the National Union of Students between 1931 and 1933. Having been appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1950 Birthday Honours for his work as Secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, Follows was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1967 New Year Honours, and knighted in the 1978 Birthday Honours for services to sport.

In January 1970, while serving as the FA secretary, Follows wrote to the Women&#x27;s Football Association (WFA) to inform them that the 1921 ban on women&#x27;s football had been rescinded. He was later appointed an honorary life vice president of the WFA.

<doc id="562904" wikidata="Q344670" url="?curid=562904" title="Dc (computer program)">
<text>dc (&quot;desk calculator&quot;) is a cross-platform reverse-Polish calculator which supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic. It was written by Lorinda Cherry and Robert Morris at Bell Labs. It is one of the oldest Unix utilities, preceding even the invention of the C programming language. Like other utilities of that vintage, it has a powerful set of features but terse syntax.
Traditionally, the bc calculator program (with infix notation) was implemented on top of dc, now the implementation of GNU dc bases on bc.

This article provides some examples in an attempt to give a general flavour of the language; for a complete list of commands and syntax, one should consult the man page for one&#x27;s specific implementation.

==History==
dc is the oldest surviving Unix language program. When its home Bell Labs received a PDP-11, dcwritten in Bwas the first language to run on the new computer, even before an assembler. Ken Thompson has opined that dc was the very first program written on the machine.

==Basic operations==
To multiply four and five in dc (note that most of the whitespace is optional):
$ cat « EOF &gt; cal.txt
4 5 *
p
EOF

$ dc cal.txt
20


The results are also available from the commands:
$ echo &quot;4 5 * p&quot; | dc
or
$ dc -
4 5*pq
20

$ dc
4 5 *
p
20
q

$ dc -e &#x27;4 5 * p&#x27;
This translates into &quot;push four and five onto the stack, then, with the multiplication operator, pop two elements from the stack, multiply them and push the result onto the stack.&quot; Then the codice_1 command is used to examine (print out to the screen) the top element on the stack. The codice_2 command quits the invoked instance of dc. Note that numbers must be spaced from each other even as some operators need not be.

The arithmetic precision is changed with the command codice_3, which sets the number of fractional digits (the number of digits following the point) to be used for arithmetic operations. Since the default precision is zero, this sequence of commands produces codice_4 as a result:

By adjusting the precision with codice_3, an arbitrary number of decimal places can be produced. This command sequence outputs codice_6.

To evaluate formula_1: (codice_7 computes the square root of the top of the stack and codice_8 is used to input a negative number):

To swap the top two elements of the stack, use the codice_9 command. To duplicate the top element, use the codice_10 command.

==Input/output==
To read a line from stdin, use the codice_11 command. This evaluates the line as if it were a dc command, and so it is necessary that it be syntactically correct and presents a potential security problem because the codice_12 dc command enables arbitrary command execution.

As mentioned above, codice_1 prints the top of the stack with a newline after it. codice_14 pops the top of the stack and prints it without a trailing newline. codice_15 prints the entire stack with one entry per line.

dc also supports arbitrary input and output radices. The codice_16 command pops the top of the stack and uses it for the input base. Hex digits must be in upper case to avoid collisions with dc commands and are limited to A-F. The codice_17 command does the same for the output base, but keep in mind that the input base affects the parsing of every numeric value afterwards so it is usually advisable to set the output base first. Therefore codice_18 sets the output radix to the current input radix, but generally not to 10 (ten). Nevertheless codice_19 resets the output base to 10 (ten), regardless of the input base. To read the values, the codice_20, codice_21 and codice_22 commands push the current precision, input radix and output radix on to the top of the stack.

As an example, to convert from hex to binary:
$ echo 16i2o DEADBEEFp | dc
11011110101011011011111011101111
==Language features==

===Registers===
In addition to these basic arithmetic and stack operations, dc includes support for macros, conditionals and storing of results for later retrieval.

The mechanism underlying macros and conditionals is the register, which in dc is a storage location with a single character name which can be stored to and retrieved from: codice_23 pops the top of the stack and stores it in register c, and codice_24 pushes the value of register c onto the stack. For example:

Registers can also be treated as secondary stacks, so values can be pushed and popped between them and the main stack using the codice_25 and codice_26 commands.

===Strings===
String values are enclosed in codice_27 and codice_28 characters and may be pushed onto the stack and stored in registers. The codice_29 command converts the low order byte of the numeric value into an ASCII character, or if the top of the stack is a string it replaces it with the first character of the string. There are no ways to build up strings or perform string manipulation other than executing it with the codice_30 command, or printing it with the codice_31 command.

The codice_32 character begins a comment to the end of the line.

===Macros===
Macros are then implemented by allowing registers and stack entries to be strings as well as numbers. A string can be printed, but it can also be executed (i.e. processed as a sequence of dc commands). So for instance we can store a macro to add one and then multiply by 2 into register m:

and then (using the codice_30 command which executes the top of the stack) we can use it like this:

===Conditionals===
Finally, we can use this macro mechanism to provide conditionals. The command codice_34 pops two values from the stack, and executes the macro stored in register codice_9 only if they are equal. So this prints the string codice_36 only if the top two values on the stack are of equal value:

Other conditionals are codice_37, codice_38, codice_39, codice_40, codice_41, which execute the specified macro if the top two values on the stack are greater, less than or equal to (&quot;not greater&quot;), less than, greater than or equal to (&quot;not less than&quot;), and not equals, respectively. Note that the order of the operands in inequality comparisons is the opposite of the order for arithmetic; evaluates to , but runs the contents of the register because .

===Loops===
Looping is then possible by defining a macro which (conditionally) reinvokes itself. A simple factorial of the top of the stack might be implemented as:

The codice_42 command exits from a macro, allowing an early return. codice_2 quits from two levels of macros (and dc itself if there are less than two levels on the call stack). codice_44 pushes the current stack depth before the codice_44 operation.

==Examples==

===Summing the entire stack===

This is implemented with a macro stored in register codice_29 which conditionally calls itself, performing an addition each time, until only one value remains on the stack. The codice_44 operator is used to push the number of entries in the stack onto the stack. The comparison operator codice_37 pops two values off the stack in making the comparison. 
dc -e &quot;1 2 4 8 16 100 0d[+z1&lt;a]dsaxp&quot;
And the result is 131.

===Summing all dc expressions as lines from file===

A bare number is a valid dc expression, so this can be used to sum a file where each line contains a single number. 

This is again implemented with a macro stored in register codice_29 which conditionally calls itself, performing an addition each time, until only one value remains on the stack. 
dc -e &quot;0d[?+z1&lt;a]dsaxp&quot; &lt; file
The codice_11 operator reads another command from the input stream. If the input line contains a decimal number, that value is added to the stack. When the input file reaches end of file, the command is null, and no value is added to the stack.
{ echo &quot;5&quot;; echo &quot;7&quot;; } | dc -e &quot;0d[?+z1&lt;a]dsaxp&quot;
And the result is 12. 

The input lines can also be complex dc commands. 
{ echo &quot;3 5 *&quot;; echo &quot;4 3 *&quot;; echo &quot;5dd++&quot;; } | dc -e &quot;0d[?+z1&lt;a]dsaxp&quot; 
And the result is 42. 

Note that since dc supports arbitrary precision, there is no concern about numeric overflow or loss of precision, no matter how many lines the input stream contains, unlike a similarly concise solution in AWK.

Downsides of this solution are: the loop stops on encountering a blank line in the input stream (technically, any input line which does not add at least one numeric value to the stack); and, for handling negative numbers, leading instances of &#x27;-&#x27; to denote a negative sign must be change to &#x27;_&#x27; in the input stream, because of dc&#x27;s nonstandard negative sign. The codice_11 operator in dc does not provide a clean way to discern reading a blank line from reading end of file.

===Unit conversion===

As an example of a relatively simple program in dc, this command (in 1 line):
dc -e &#x27;[[Enter a number (metres), or 0 to exit]PAP]sh[q]sz[lhx?d0=zAk.0254/.5+0kC~1/rn[ feet ]Pn[ inches]PAPdx]dx&#x27;
converts distances from metres to feet and inches; the bulk of it is concerned with prompting for input, printing output in a suitable format and looping around to convert another number.

===Greatest common divisor===

As an example, here is an implementation of the [[Euclidean algorithm]] to find the [[Greatest common divisor|GCD]]:
dc -e &#x27;??[dSarLa%d0&lt;a]dsax+p&#x27; # shortest
dc -e &#x27;[a=]P?[b=]P?[dSarLa%d0&lt;a]dsax+[GCD:]Pp&#x27; # easier-to-read version
===Factorial===

Computing the [[factorial]] of an input value, formula_2
dc -e &#x27;?[q]sQ[d1=Qd1-lFx*]dsFxp&#x27;
===Quines in dc===

There exist also [[Quine (computing)|quines]] in the programming language dc; programs that produce its source code as output.
dc -e &#x27;[91Pn[dx]93Pn]dx&#x27;

dc -e &#x27;[91PP93P[dx]P]dx&#x27;
===Printing all prime numbers===
dc -e &#x27;2p3p[dl!d2+s!%0=@l!l^!&lt;#]s#[s/0ds^]s@[p]s&amp;[ddvs^3s!l#x0&lt;&amp;2+l.x]ds.x&#x27;

This program was written by Michel Charpentier. 
It outputs the sequence of prime numbers.
Note that shorter implementation is possible, which needs fourteen symbols fewer.

dc -e &#x27;2p3p[pq]s$[l!2+ds!l^&lt;$dl!%0&lt;#]s#[+dvs^1s!l#x2l.x]ds.x&#x27;
===Integer factorization===
dc -e &#x27;[n=]P?[p]s2[lip/dli%0=1dvsr]s12sid2%0=13sidvsr[dli%0=1lrli2+dsi!&gt;.]ds.xd1&lt;2&#x27;

This program was also written by Michel Charpentier. 

There is a shorter

dc -e &quot;[n=]P?[lfp/dlf%0=Fdvsr]sF[dsf]sJdvsr2sf[dlf%0=Flfdd2%+1+sflr&lt;Jd1&lt;M]dsMx&quot;
and a faster solution (try with the 200-bit number (input codice_52)

dc -e &quot;[n=]P?[lfp/dlf% 0=Fdvsr]sFdvsr2sfd2%0=F3sfd3%0=F5sf[dlf%0=Flfd4+sflr&gt;M]sN[dlf%0=Flfd2+sflr&gt;N]dsMx[p]sMd1&lt;M&quot; 
Note that the latter can be sped up even more, if the access to a constant is replaced by a register access.
dc -e &quot;[n=]P?[lfp/dlf%l0=Fdvsr]sF2s2dvsr2sf4s4d2%0=F3sfd3%0=F5sf[dlf%l0=Flfdl4+sflr&gt;M]sN[dlf%l0=Flfdl2+sflr&gt;N]dsMx[p]sMd1&lt;M&quot;
===Calculating Pi===

An implementation of the [[Chudnovsky algorithm]] in the programming language dc. The program will print better and better approximations as it runs. But as pi is a transcendental number, the program will continue until interrupted or resource exhaustion of the machine it is run on.
dc -e &#x27;_640320[0ksslk3^16lkd12+sk*-lm*lhd1+sh3^/smlxlj*sxll545140134+dsllm*lxlnk/ls+dls!=P]sP3^sj7sn[6sk1ddshsxsm13591409dsllPx10005v426880*ls/K3-k1/pcln14+snlMx]dsMx&#x27;
A fast divide and conquer implementation of the same formula that doubles in size each iteration. It evaluates a finite number if sums as an exact rational number and only performs one large division and square root per iteration. It is fast, but will still quickly slow down as the size of the fraction increases. 
dc -e &#x27;1Sk1SR13591409dSBSP426880dSQ4/3^9*SC[0r-]s-[lkE*1-k10005vlQ*lP/nAan0k]dSox[Lkd1+Skdd1+Sk3^lC*SQ2*1-d3*d*4-*dSR545140134LB+dSB*lk2%0=-SP]dszx[LRLRdLP*LPLQdLQ*SQ*+SP*SR]sc[d1-d0&lt;yd0&lt;yd0=z0=zlcx]sy0[lcxlox1+lyxllx]dslx&#x27;
===Diffie–Hellman key exchange===

A more complex example of dc use embedded in a [[Perl]] script performs a [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]]. This was popular as a [[signature block]] among [[cypherpunk]]s during the [[ITAR]] debates, where the short script could be run with only Perl and dc, ubiquitous programs on Unix-like operating systems:
#!/usr/bin/perl -- -export-a-crypto-system-sig Diffie-Hellman-2-lines
($g, $e, $m) = @ARGV, $m || die &quot;$0 gen exp mod\n&quot;;
print `echo &quot;16dio1[d2%Sa2/d0&lt;X+d*La1=z\U$m%0]SX$e&quot;[$g*]\EszlXx+p | dc`
A commented version is slightly easier to understand and shows how to use loops, conditionals, and the codice_2 command to return from a macro. With the GNU version of dc, the codice_54 command can be used to do arbitrary precision modular exponentiation without needing to write the X function.
#!/usr/bin/perl

my ($g, $e, $m) = map { &quot;\U$_&quot; } @ARGV;
die &quot;$0 gen exp mod\n&quot; unless $m;

print `echo $g $e $m | dc -e &#x27;
# Hex input and output
16dio
# Read m, e and g from stdin on one line
?SmSeSg

# Function z: return g * top of stack

<text>In semiotics, a sign is anything that communicates a meaning that is not the sign itself to the interpreter of the sign. The meaning can be intentional, as when a word is uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, as when a symptom is taken as a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the senses, visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or taste.

Two major theories describe the way signs acquire the ability to transfer information. Both theories understand the defining property of the sign as a relation between a number of elements. In semiology, the tradition of semiotics developed by Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), the sign relation is dyadic, consisting only of a form of the sign (the signifier) and its meaning (the signified). Saussure saw this relation as being essentially arbitrary (the principle of semiotic arbitrariness), motivated only by social convention. Saussure&#x27;s theory has been particularly influential in the study of linguistic signs. The other major semiotic theory, developed by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), defines the sign as a triadic relation as &quot;something that stands for something, to someone in some capacity&quot;. This means that a sign is a relation between the sign vehicle (the specific physical form of the sign), a sign object (the aspect of the world that the sign carries meaning about) and an interpretant (the meaning of the sign as understood by an interpreter). According to Peirce, signs can be divided by the type of relation that holds the sign relation together as either icons, indices or symbols. Icons are those signs that signify by means of similarity between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a portrait or map), indices are those that signify by means of a direct relation of contiguity or causality between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a symptom), and symbols are those that signify through a law or arbitrary social convention.

== Dyadic signs ==
According to Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), a sign is composed of the &quot;signifier&quot; (&quot;signifiant&quot;), and the &quot;signified&quot; (&quot;signifié&quot;). These cannot be conceptualized as separate entities but rather as a mapping from significant differences in sound to potential (correct) differential denotation. The Saussurean sign exists only at the level of the system, in which signs are defined by their relative and hierarchical privileges of co-occurrence. It is thus a common misreading of Saussure to take signifiers to be anything one could speak, and signifieds as things in the world. In fact, the relationship of language to parole (or speech-in-context) is and always has been a theoretical problem for linguistics (cf. Roman Jakobson&#x27;s famous essay &quot;Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics&quot; et al.).

A famous thesis by Saussure states that the relationship between a sign and the real-world thing it denotes is an arbitrary one. There is not a natural relationship between a word and the object it refers to, nor is there a causal relationship between the inherent properties of the object and the nature of the sign used to denote it. For example, there is nothing about the physical quality of paper that requires denotation by the phonological sequence &#x27;paper&#x27;. There is, however, what Saussure called &#x27;relative motivation&#x27;: the possibilities of signification of a signifier are constrained by the compositionality of elements in the linguistic system (cf. Émile Benveniste&#x27;s paper on the arbitrariness of the sign in the first volume of his papers on general linguistics). In other words, a word is only available to acquire a new meaning if it is identifiably &quot;different&quot; from all the other words in the language and it has no existing meaning. Structuralism was later based on this idea that it is only within a given system that one can define the distinction between the levels of system and use, or the semantic &quot;value&quot; of a sign.

==Triadic signs==
Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) proposed a different theory. Unlike Saussure who approached the conceptual question from a study of linguistics and phonology, Peirce, considered the father of Pragmaticism, extended the concept of sign to embrace many other forms. He considered &quot;word&quot; to be only one particular kind of sign, and characterized sign as any mediational means to understanding. He covered not only artificial, linguistic and symbolic signs, but also all semblances (such as kindred sensible qualities), and all indicators (such as mechanical reactions). He counted as symbols all terms, propositions and arguments whose interpretation is based upon convention or habit, even apart from their expression in particular languages. He held that &quot;all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs&quot;. The setting of Peirce&#x27;s study of signs is philosophical logic, which he defined as formal semiotic, and characterized as a normative field following esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics, and as the art of devising methods of research. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs, that all thought has the form of inference (even when not conscious and deliberate), and that, as inference, &quot;logic is rooted in the social principle&quot;, since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited. The result is a theory not of language in particular, but rather of the production of meaning, and it rejects the idea of a static relationship between a sign and what it represents: its &quot;object&quot;. Peirce believed that signs are meaningful through recursive relationships that arise in sets of three.

Even when a sign represents by a resemblance or factual connection independent of interpretation, the sign is a sign only insofar as it is at least potentially interpretable by a mind and insofar as the sign is a determination of a mind or at least a &quot;quasi-mind&quot;, that functions as if it were a mind, for example in crystals and the work of bees—the focus here is on sign action in general, not on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields Peirce also pursued).

A sign depends on an object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) an interpretation, an &quot;interpretant&quot;, to depend on the object &quot;as the sign depends on the object&quot;. The interpretant, then, is a further sign of the object, and thus enables and determines still further interpretations, further interpretant signs. The process, called &quot;semiosis&quot;, is irreducibly triadic, Peirce held, and is logically structured to perpetuate itself. It is what defines sign, object and interpretant in general. As Jean-Jacques Nattiez put it, &quot;the process of referring effected by the sign is &quot;infinite&quot;.&quot; (Peirce used the word &quot;determine&quot; in the sense not of strict determinism, but of effectiveness that can vary like an influence.)

Peirce further characterized the three semiotic elements as follows:
# &quot;Sign&quot; (or &quot;representamen&quot;): that which represents the denoted object (cf. Saussure&#x27;s &quot;signifier&quot;).
# &quot;Object&quot; (or &quot;semiotic object&quot;): that which the sign represents (or as some put it, encodes). It can be anything thinkable, a law, a fact, or even a possibility (a semiotic object could even be fictional, such as Hamlet); those are partial objects; the total object is the universe of discourse, the totality of objects in that world to which one attributes the partial object. For example, perturbation of Neptune&#x27;s orbit is a sign about Pluto, but not only about Pluto. The object may be
## &quot;immediate&quot; to the sign, the object as represented in the sign, or
## &quot;dynamic&quot;, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded.
# &quot;Interpretant&quot; (or &quot;interpretant sign&quot;): a sign&#x27;s meaning or ramification as formed into a further sign by interpreting (or, as some put it, decoding) the sign. The interpretant may be:
##&quot;immediate&quot; to the sign, a kind of possibility, all that the sign is suited to immediately express, for instance a word&#x27;s usual meaning;
##&quot;dynamic&quot;, that is, the meaning as formed into an actual effect, for example an individual translation or a state of agitation, or
##&quot;final&quot; or &quot;normal&quot;, that is, the ultimate meaning that inquiry taken far enough would be destined to reach. It is a kind of norm or ideal end, with which an actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.

Peirce explained that signs mediate between their objects and their interpretants in semiosis, the triadic process of determination. In semiosis a &quot;first&quot; is determined or influenced to be a sign by a &quot;second&quot;, as its object. The object determines the sign to determine a &quot;third&quot; as an interpretant. &quot;Firstness&quot; itself is one of Peirce&#x27;s three categories of all phenomena, and is quality of feeling. Firstness is associated with a vague state of mind as feeling and a sense of the possibilities, with neither compulsion nor reflection. In semiosis the mind discerns an appearance or phenomenon, a potential sign. &quot;Secondness&quot; is reaction or resistance, a category associated with moving from possibility to determinate actuality. Here, through experience outside of and collateral to the given sign or sign system, one recalls or discovers the object the sign refers to, for example when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent but remembered object. It is through one&#x27;s collateral experience that the object determines the sign to determine an interpretant. &quot;Thirdness&quot; is representation or mediation, the category associated with signs, generality, rule, continuity, habit-taking and purpose. Here one forms an interpretant expressing a meaning or ramification of the sign about the object. When a second sign is considered, the initial interpretant may be confirmed, or new possible meanings may be identified. As each new sign is addressed, more interpretants, themselves signs, emerge. It can involve a mind&#x27;s reading of nature, people, mathematics, anything.

Peirce generalized the communicational idea of utterance and interpretation of a sign, to cover all signs:
According to Nattiez, writing with Jean Molino, the tripartite definition of sign, object and interpretant is based on the &quot;trace&quot; or neutral level, Saussure&#x27;s &quot;sound-image&quot; (or &quot;signified&quot;, thus Peirce&#x27;s &quot;representamen&quot;). Thus, &quot;a symbolic form...is not some &#x27;intermediary&#x27; in a process of &#x27;communication&#x27; that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex &quot;process&quot; of creation (the poietic process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the &quot;esthesic&quot; process that &quot;reconstructs&quot; a &#x27;message&#x27;&quot;).

Molino&#x27;s and Nattiez&#x27;s diagram:
Peirce&#x27;s theory of the sign therefore offered a powerful analysis of the signification system, its codes, and its processes of inference and learning—because the focus was often on natural or cultural context rather than linguistics, which only analyses usage in slow time whereas human semiotic interaction in the real world often has a chaotic blur of language and signal exchange. Nevertheless, the implication that triadic relations are structured to perpetuate themselves leads to a level of complexity not usually experienced in the routine of message creation and interpretation. Hence, different ways of expressing the idea have developed.

=== Classes of triadic signs ===
By 1903, Peirce came to classify signs by three universal trichotomies dependent on his three categories (quality, fact, habit). He classified any sign: 
# by what stands as the sign—either (&quot;qualisign&quot;, also called a &quot;tone&quot;) a quality—or (&quot;sinsign&quot;, also called &quot;token&quot;) an individual fact—or (&quot;legisign&quot;, also called &quot;type&quot;) a rule, a habit;
# by how the sign stands for its object—either (&quot;icon&quot;) by its own quality, such that it resembles the object, regardless of factual connection and of interpretive rule of reference—or (&quot;index&quot;) by factual connection to its object, regardless of resemblance and of interpretive rule of reference—or (&quot;symbol&quot;) by rule or habit of interpreted reference to its object, regardless of resemblance and of factual connection; and
# by how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant—either (&quot;rheme&quot;, also called &quot;seme&quot;, such as a term) as regards quality or possibility, as if the sign were a qualisign, though it can be qualisign, sinsign, or legisign—or (&quot;dicisign&quot;, also called &quot;pheme&quot;, such as a proposition) as regards fact, as if the sign were an index, though it can be index or symbol—or (&quot;argument&quot;, also called &quot;delome&quot;) as regards rule or habit. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks in an inference process.
* Any qualisign is an icon. Sinsigns include some icons and some indices. Legisigns include some icons, some indices and all symbols.
* Any icon is a rheme. Indices (be they sinsigns or legisigns) include some rhemes and some dicisigns. Symbols include some rhemes, some dicisigns and all arguments.

Because of those classificatory interdependences, the three trichotomies intersect to form ten (rather than 27) classes of signs. There are also various kinds of meaningful combination. Signs can be attached to one another. A photograph is an index with a meaningfully attached icon. Arguments are composed of dicisigns, and dicisigns are composed of rhemes. In order to be embodied, legisigns (types) need sinsigns (tokens) as their individual replicas or instances. A symbol depends as a sign on how it &quot;will&quot; be interpreted, regardless of resemblance or factual connection to its object; but the symbol&#x27;s individual embodiment is an index to your experience of the object. A symbol is instanced by a specialized indexical sinsign. A symbol such as a sentence in a language prescribes qualities of appearance for its instances, and is itself a replica of a symbol such as a proposition apart from expression in a particular language. Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his theoretical grammar, as he sometimes called it. He regarded formal semiotic, as logic, as furthermore encompassing study of arguments (hypothetical, deductive and inductive) and inquiry&#x27;s methods including pragmatism; and as allied to but distinct from logic&#x27;s pure mathematics.

Peirce sometimes referred to the &quot;ground&quot; of a sign. The ground is the pure abstraction of a quality. A sign&#x27;s ground is the &quot;respect&quot; in which the sign represents its object, e.g. as in literal and figurative language. For example, an icon &quot;presents&quot; a characteristic or quality attributed to an object, while a symbol &quot;imputes&quot; to an object a quality either presented by an icon or symbolized so as to evoke a mental icon.

Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a &quot;hypoicon&quot;, and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the &quot;image&quot;, which depends on a simple quality; (b) the &quot;diagram&quot;, whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the &quot;metaphor&quot;, which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else. A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form &quot;All __ is ___&quot; which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations. Peirce held that mathematics is done by diagrammatic thinking—observation of, and experimentation on, diagrams. Peirce developed for deductive logic a system of visual existential graphs, which continue to be researched today.

== 20th-century theories ==
It is now agreed that the effectiveness of the acts that may convert the message into text (including speaking, writing, drawing, music and physical movements) depends upon &quot;the knowledge of the sender&quot;. If the sender is not familiar with the current language, its codes and its culture, then he or she will not be able to say anything at all, whether as a visitor in a different language area or because of a medical condition such as aphasia.

Modern theories deny the Saussurian distinction between signifier and signified, and look for meaning not in the individual signs, but in their context and the framework of potential meanings that could be applied. Such theories assert that language is a collective memory or cultural history of all the different ways in which meaning has been communicated, and may to that extent, constitute all life&#x27;s experiences (see Louis Hjelmslev). Hjelmslev did not consider the sign to be the smallest semiotic unit, as he believed it possible to decompose it further; instead, he considered the &quot;internal structure of language&quot; to be a system of &quot;figurae&quot;, a concept somewhat related to that of figure of speech, which he considered to be the ultimate semiotic unit.

This position implies that speaking is simply one more form of behaviour and changes the focus of attention from the text as language, to the text as a representation of purpose, a functional version of authorial intent. But, once the message has been transmitted, the text exists independently.

Hence, although the writers who co-operated to produce this page exist, they can only be represented by the signs actually selected and presented here. The interpretation process in the receiver&#x27;s mind may attribute meanings completely different from those intended by the senders. But, why might this happen? Neither the sender nor the receiver of a text has a perfect grasp of all language. Each individual&#x27;s relatively small &quot;stock&quot; of knowledge is the product of personal experience and their attitude to learning. When the audience receives the message, there will always be an excess of connotations available to be applied to the particular signs in their context (no matter how relatively complete or incomplete their knowledge, the cognitive process is the same).

The first stage in understanding the message is therefore, to suspend or defer judgement until more information becomes available. At some point, the individual receiver decides which of all possible meanings represents the best possible fit. Sometimes, uncertainty may not be resolved, so meaning is indefinitely deferred, or a provisional or approximate meaning is allocated. More often, the receiver&#x27;s desire for closure (see Gestalt psychology) leads to simple meanings being attributed out of prejudices and without reference to the sender&#x27;s intentions.

== Postmodern theory ==
In critical theory, the notion of sign is used variously. As Daniel Chandler has said:
=== Semiotic black hole ===
In the semiotic theory of Félix Guattari, semiotic black holes are the &quot;a-temporal&quot; destruction of &quot;signs&quot;.

<text>Cartoon Network (formerly Teletoon) is a Canadian English-language discretionary specialty channel owned by Corus Entertainment. The channel primarily broadcasts animated series aimed at children and teenagers. It was launched on October 17, 1997, by Teletoon Canada, Inc., a consortium of Western International Communications and Astral Media (via their specialty channel Family Channel), Shaw Communications (via its specialty channel YTV), and the animation studios Cinar and Nelvana. With subsequent acquisitions and divestments, Corus became the sole owner of the channel in 2014.

The channel has historically aired a mix of domestic productions and imported series, with many of the latter coming from U.S. channel Cartoon Network. In 2012, Teletoon launched a Canadian version of Cartoon Network as a sister network under license from Turner Broadcasting. In February 2023, Corus announced that Teletoon would rebrand as Cartoon Network on March 27, 2023, with the previous Cartoon Network channel concurrently relaunching under Cartoon Network&#x27;s own sister brand Boomerang.

Cartoon Network operates two timeshift feeds running on Eastern and Pacific schedules. Along with its French-language counterpart Télétoon, it is available in over 7.3 million households in Canada as of November 2013.

==History==

=== As Teletoon ===

In 1997, Teletoon was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) after a related application for a channel to be called &quot;Fun TV&quot; had been denied. The English-language version of Teletoon launched on October 17, 1997. The channel was originally owned by a consortium of other Canadian specialty services, including Family Channel acting as managing partner at 53.3% (Superchannel/WIC and The Movie Network/Astral Media), YTV at 26.7%, (Shaw Communications), along with the Canadian animation studios Cinar and Nelvana with 10% each. Shaw spun off its entertainment assets as Corus Entertainment in 1999, which subsequently acquired WIC&#x27;s stake in Family Channel among other assets as part of its breakup later that year, Corus acquired Nelvana in 2000.

Teletoon was licensed as a bilingual service in both English and French, being one of only two Canadian speciality services with such a license; the channel maintains two feeds under the license, with the French feed operating under the branding Télétoon. At the original licensing hearing before the CRTC, the network&#x27;s operators had stated that the two channels &quot;would be similar in nature and programmed with a similar attitude towards them&quot;, but that there may be differences in their programming due to market differences (including Quebec&#x27;s prohibition on advertising to children) and program rights. To this end, Teletoon often commissioned programming to air in both English and French whenever possible.
As a condition of the license, Teletoon committed to devoting 40% of its programming to Canadian content in its first year of operation, gradually increasing by five per cent yearly to 60% by 2002. Over a similar timeframe, it also committed to similarly have at least half of its programming financed by, and commissioned from third parties unaffiliated with its owners.

In 1998, network management decided to focus on renewals instead of new shows—adopting a more cautious strategy than launching a significant number of new series, as it had in the prior year. By 2001, the channel had invested over $96 million into 98 original productions since its launch; Teletoon&#x27;s director of original programming Madeleine Levesque stated that &quot;I don’t think any other broadcaster has contributed so much, so well, so fast.&quot;
On March 4, 2013, Corus Entertainment announced that it would acquire Astral&#x27;s stake in Teletoon, giving it full ownership. The sale was part of divestitures tied to Astral Media&#x27;s proposed sale to Bell Media, which had earlier been rejected by the CRTC in October 2012 for competition reasons. Corus&#x27;s purchase was cleared by the Competition Bureau two weeks later on March 18; the transaction was approved by the CRTC on December 20, 2013, and completed on January 1, 2014. The channel was subsequently brought under the new Corus Kids division as part of a reorganization in February 2014, alongside YTV and Nelvana. Teletoon and its sister networks would maintain separate management from YTV.

=== As Cartoon Network ===
On February 21, 2023, Corus announced that Teletoon would be rebranded as Cartoon Network on March 27, 2023; the existing Cartoon Network channel concurrently relaunched under Cartoon Network&#x27;s sibling brand Boomerang (which will be devoted to library programming and classic franchises); the Teletoon brand would continue to be used for its companion streaming service Teletoon+, and its French-language feed.

==Programming==
As Teletoon, the channel&#x27;s license originally required that 90% of all programs on the channel be animated. Teletoon previously aired preschool-oriented programming, which was day-parted from 4:00 a.m.- 3:00 p.m. At its inception in 1996, Teletoon had a stated goal of producing 78 half-hours of original content every year, and it has been active in commissioning programming since then.

Since its inception, the channel has acquired numerous television series from the U.S.-based Cartoon Network and its late night block, Adult Swim. From September 1, 2015, to Fall 2016, original programming from the American channel was moved over to its Canadian counterpart. Around the same time, several &quot;retro&quot; programs airing on Teletoon Retro, which closed down on the same date, began airing on Teletoon. Teletoon would also premiere new original programming from Cartoon Network&#x27;s sister channel, Boomerang.

On April 1, 2019, the channel discontinued its adult programming following the relaunch of Action as a full-time Adult Swim channel.

===Notable programming blocks===
*Teletoon Unleashed! –Launched in 2000, Teletoon Unleashed! was an adult-oriented block of the channel; it co-existed with The Detour on Teletoon until the block merged with it in 2004. It was known for airing every show with an 18+ rating to attract an adult audience, regardless of whether the program actually contained adults-only material or not.
* Teletoon at Night – Launched in September 2002 as The Detour on Teletoon, this block was an amalgamation of it and Teletoon Unleashed. Its French counterpart, Télétoon la nuit, airs on the Francophone Télétoon channel. In September 2009, the block was relaunched under what would become its final name with an overhaul of its appearance. The block was discontinued on April 1, 2019.
* Teletoon Retro – Teletoon Retro was the branding and block for classic animated programming. It was later spun into a digital channel, which also featured several live-action series. The channel launched on October 1, 2007, and closed on September 1, 2015. 
* Can&#x27;t Miss Thursdays – A block for first-run programming premieres that aired on Thursday nights. The block later featured live-action, hosted segments.
* Superfan Fridays – A block showcasing comic book-related and action-oriented animated series.

===Branding history===
Initially, Teletoon&#x27;s programming was divided into dayparted blocks, each featuring a different style of animation. Each blocks were represented as planets: 
* Morning Planet for Preschoolers (claymation animation; 5:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. EST)
* Afternoon Planet for Kids (2D cel animation; 3:00 p.m.- 6:00 p.m.)
* Evening Planet for Family (collage animation; 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. EST)
* Night Planet for Adults (papier-mâché animation; 9:00 p.m. - 5:00 a.m. EST)
The bumpers were made by Cuppa Coffee Studios.

This branding would be discontinued and replaced by a more generic look in mid-August 1998, and begin using the slogan, “It’s Unreal!” (or “Imagine!” in the French feed). In 1999, Teletoon was airing bumpers with its first mascot, &quot;Teletina&quot;. These bumpers were made by Spin Productions in Toronto.

The channel&#x27;s on-air appearance was revamped to a more “cartoony”-style in 2001. The logo was modified slightly and came in different coloured border variations, and in addition, a new alternate logo was introduced, consisting of a wordmark of the channel&#x27;s name in a custom font. This wordmark would serve as the channel&#x27;s secondary logo for its programming blocks and certain graphic presentations, while the original logo would be the primary logo for its corporate material and overall brand representation. Several more bumpers using CGI animation made by Guru Studio subsequently premiered on the channel during this period.

An updated look for the channel was unveiled, no longer featuring the original logo (and fully utilizing the wordmark), for a partial rebranding made by the Montreal-based Buzz Image Group on August 29, 2005. Despite this, the original logo would still be used in some form up until 2007, most notably as a production logo and also on their website.

On February 5, 2007, the channel&#x27;s wordmark was removed and the original logo was officially replaced as part of a major rebrand. Teletoon&#x27;s website and its on-air appearance were dramatically changed, and the overall aesthetic of both the channel and its bumpers were immensely modernized.

On September 5, 2011, to reflect the channel&#x27;s transition to digital television, the logo was refined and changed to a more three-dimensional appearance, designed by New York-based design agency Trollbäck &amp; Company.

==Related services==
On November 24, 2000, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved multiple applications from Teletoon Canada Inc. to launch six Category 2 television channels named Teletoon Action, Teletoon Adult, Teletoon Art, Teletoon Multi, Teletoon Pop and Teletoon Retro. None of the channels launched and their broadcast licenses expired on November 24, 2004. The Teletoon Retro concept would later be revived under a different license.

===Current===
====Télétoon====

Télétoon is the French-language counterpart which broadcasts most of the shows from Cartoon Network in French.

====Boomerang====

On November 4, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application from Teletoon to launch Teletoon Kapow!, a Category B digital cable and satellite channel devoted &quot;programming from international markets, featuring the latest trends in non-violent action, adventure, superheroes, comedy and interactivity.&quot; On February 2, 2012, Teletoon announced that it would launch a local Cartoon Network channel in Canada. It debuted using the Teletoon Kapow! license on July 4, 2012.

As of September 1, 2015, Cartoon Network operates under the broadcast license originally granted for Teletoon Retro. Corus then had the Teletoon Kapow! license revoked on October 2, 2015.

Concurrent with the rebranding of Teletoon itself as Cartoon Network, the original Cartoon Network channel was relaunched as a Canadian version of Boomerang.

====Teletoon+====
Teletoon+ is a subscription video on demand service which launched September 1, 2022 on Amazon Prime Video Channels, replacing Corus&#x27;s previous Nick+ service (which was a streaming counterpart to its Nickelodeon channel). The service features exclusive content acquired from Cartoon Network and Warner Bros. Animation.

===Former===
====Teletoon Retro====

Teletoon Retro was a Category B digital cable and satellite channel that debuted in fall 2007, and was named after a program block that featured classic animated series. Shows seen on the channel included &quot;The Tom and Jerry Show&quot;, &quot;The Bugs Bunny &amp; Tweety Show&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Raccoons&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;, &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, and &quot;Gumby&quot;.

The channel was discontinued on September 1, 2015, with Disney Channel (on Bell Aliant, Bell Satellite TV, EastLink, Telus Optik TV, VMedia, Vidéotron, MTS, Bell Fibe TV, NorthernTel, Novus, and Zazeen), or Cartoon Network (on Shaw Direct/Shaw Cable, Rogers Cable, SaskTel and many independent providers) taking over its slot on several aforementioned providers. In the years since, Teletoon has aired classic programming during non-peak viewing hours.

<text>The Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Spain is the United Kingdom&#x27;s foremost diplomatic representative in the Kingdom of Spain, and in charge of the UK&#x27;s diplomatic mission in Spain. The official title is His Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Ambassador to the Kingdom of Spain.

The British ambassador to Spain is also non-resident ambassador to the Principality of Andorra.

In 1822, the Foreign Secretary at that time, George Canning, downgraded the Embassy to a Mission, and the Head of Mission from an Ambassador to an Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, to reflect Spain&#x27;s decreased importance on the world stage. The Mission in Madrid was upgraded to a full Embassy once more on 9 December 1887.

==List of heads of mission==

The following is a partial list of British ambassadors to Spain.

Titles of the heads of mission: 
* From 1509 to 1683: Ambassador
* From 1683 to 1710: Envoy Extraordinary
* From 1711 to 1821: Ambassador
* From 1822 to 1887: Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary
* Since 1887: Ambassador

<doc id="562921" wikidata="Q461606" url="?curid=562921" title="Arsène Lupin">
<text>Arsène Lupin () is a fictional gentleman thief and master of disguise created in 1905 by French writer Maurice Leblanc. The character was first introduced in a series of short stories serialized in the magazine &quot;Je sais tout&quot;. The first story, &quot;The Arrest of Arsène Lupin&quot;, was published on 15 July 1905. 

The character has also appeared in a number of books by other writers as well as numerous film, television, stage play, and comic book adaptations.

== Antecedents ==
Arsène Lupin was a literary descendant of Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail&#x27;s fictional character Rocambole, whose adventures were published from 1857 to 1870. Like Rocambole, Lupin is often a force for good while operating on the wrong side of the law. Lupin shares similarities with E. W. Hornung&#x27;s gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, whose stories were published from 1898 to 1909. Both Raffles and Lupin have inspired later characters such as Louis Joseph Vance&#x27;s The Lone Wolf (created in 1914) and Leslie Charteris&#x27;s The Saint (created in 1928).

==Overview==
Lupin was featured in 17 novels and 39 novellas by Leblanc, with the novellas or short stories collected into book form for a total of 24 books. The number becomes 25 if the 1923 novel &quot;The Secret Tomb&quot; is counted: Lupin does not appear in it, but the main character Dorothée solves one of Arsène Lupin&#x27;s four fabulous secrets.

Several Arsène Lupin novels contain some fantasy elements: a radioactive &quot;god-stone&quot; that cures people and causes mutations is the object of an epic battle in &quot;L’Île aux trente cercueils&quot;; the secret of the Fountain of Youth, a mineral water source hidden beneath a lake in the Auvergne, is the goal sought by the protagonists in &quot;La Demoiselle aux yeux verts&quot;; finally, in &quot;La Comtesse de Cagliostro&quot;, Lupin&#x27;s arch-enemy and lover is none other than Joséphine Balsamo, the alleged granddaughter of Cagliostro himself.

==Arsène Lupin and Sherlock Holmes==
===Leblanc&#x27;s &quot;Herlock Sholmès&quot;===

Leblanc introduced Sherlock Holmes to Lupin in the short story &quot;Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late&quot; in &quot;Je sais tout&quot; No. 17, 15 June 1906. In it, an aged Holmes meets a young Lupin for the first time. After legal objections from Arthur Conan Doyle, the name was changed to &quot;Herlock Sholmès&quot; either because of literary copyright on the character, or, as Maurice Leblanc&#x27;s son claims, at Doyle&#x27;s request.

Sholmès returned in two more stories collected in Volume 2, &quot;Arsène Lupin contre Herlock Sholmès&quot;, and then in a guest-starring role in the battle for the secret of the Hollow Needle in &quot;L&#x27;Aiguille creuse&quot;. &quot;Arsène Lupin contre Herlock Sholmès&quot; was published in the United States in 1910 under the title &quot;The Blonde Lady&quot; which used the name &quot;Holmlock Shears&quot; for Sherlock Holmes, and &quot;Wilson&quot; for Watson. It is also stated in this book that Arsene Lupin is a vegetarian for &quot;hygiene&quot; reasons though he is not averse to eating meat to avoid being eccentric or stand-out when in company while on the job.

===Other Sherlock Holmes references===
Sherlock Holmes, this time with his real name and accompanied by familiar characters such as Watson and Lestrade (all copyright protection having expired), also confronted Arsène Lupin in the 2008 PC 3D adventure game &quot;Sherlock Holmes Versus Arsène Lupin&quot;. In this game Holmes (and occasionally others) are attempting to stop Lupin from stealing five valuable British items. Lupin wants to steal the items in order to humiliate Britain, but he also admires Holmes and thus challenges him to try to stop him.

In a novella &quot;The Prisoner of the Tower, or A Short But Beautiful Journey of Three Wise Men&quot; by Boris Akunin published in 2008 in Russia as the conclusion of &quot;Jade Rosary Beads&quot; book, Sherlock Holmes and Erast Fandorin oppose Arsène Lupin on 31 December 1899.

Due to longstanding copyright issues related to the character of Sherlock Holmes with the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the name &quot;Herlock Sholmes&quot; was used for the character of the same name in the international release of the video game series &quot;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&quot; (2015–2021) in honour of Leblanc, with the characters of John and Iris Watson having their surnames changed to &quot;Wilson&quot;.

In the pastiche &quot;Larsen Hupin dans les pas de Charles Kolms&quot; (2021), the detective investigates at the same time as the gentleman thief.

In the pastiche &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes – The Gentleman Burglar&quot; (2024), Holmes and Lupin team up to solve intricate riddles and journey across France and beyond to uncover the long-lost treasure of the House of Bourbon.

<doc id="562925" wikidata="Q5976062" url="?curid=562925" title="I Am Sitting in a Room">
<text>I am sitting in a room is a sound art piece by American composer and sound artist Alvin Lucier composed in 1969.

The piece features Lucier recording himself narrating a text, and then playing the tape recording back into the room while re-recording it. The new recording is then played back and re-recorded, and this process is repeated. Due to the room&#x27;s particular size and geometry, certain resonant frequencies are emphasized while others are attenuated. Eventually the words become unintelligible, replaced by the characteristic resonance of the room.

In his book on the origins of minimalism, Edward Strickland wrote that &quot;In its repetition and limited means, &quot;I am sitting in a room&quot; ranks with the finest achievements of Minimal tape music. Furthermore, in its ambient conversion of speech modules into drone frequencies, it unites the two principal structural components of Minimal music in general.&quot;

==History and performances==
Lucier was inspired to create &quot;I am sitting in a room&quot; after a colleague mentioned attending a lecture at MIT in which Amar Bose described how he tested characteristics of the loudspeakers he was developing by feeding back audio into them that they had produced in the first place and then was picked up via microphones.

The first recording of &quot;I am sitting in a room&quot; was made at the Electronic Music Studio at Brandeis University in 1969. The second recording was made in March 1970 in Lucier&#x27;s apartment in Middletown, Connecticut. 

The first performance of the work was in 1970 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. In collaboration with his partner Mary Lucier, the performance featured projections of Polaroid photographs that had been degraded like the voice.

A third, higher fidelity recording of &quot;I am sitting in a room&quot; lasting over forty minutes was released by Lovely Music in 1981.

Lucier performed the piece during the 2012 Venice Biennale Musica at the Teatro alle Tese, and a recording of this performance was commercially released on the 2016 album &quot;Alvin Lucier / Alter Ego: Two Circles&quot;.

Some of the last performances by Lucier included one at MIT&#x27;s &quot;Seeing/Sounding/Sensing&quot; symposium in September 2014, and the full collaborative piece was performed for the first time in over 50 years as part of the New Ear Festival at the Fridman Gallery in New York in 2019.

==Full text==
The text spoken by Lucier describes the process of the work, concluding with a reference to his own stuttering:

 In one recording he substitutes the text &quot;the same as&quot; instead of &quot;different from&quot;.

==Subsequent works==
In 2010, YouTube user Patrick Liddell created an homage to &quot;I am sitting in a room&quot; entitled &quot;VIDEO ROOM 1000&quot;, in which he uploaded a video of himself speaking text similar to Lucier&#x27;s original to YouTube, then manually downloaded and re-uploaded it 1,000 times in sequence over the course of a year, in order to demonstrate the resulting digital artifacting of audio and video analogously to Lucier&#x27;s original demonstration of analog artifacting of audio.

In 2013, filmmakers Viola Rusche and Hauke Harder decided to use &quot;I am sitting in a room&quot; as the &quot;main structuring element&quot; of the documentary &quot;No Ideas but In Things&quot; (2013). According to the filmmakers&#x27; notes, &quot;the various process steps of the piece [&quot;I am sitting in a room&quot;] divide the film into chapters so that this work serves as an integral part of the film.&quot;

Similar to Patrick Liddell, in 2019, YouTube user Marques Brownlee created an homage to &quot;I am sitting in a room&quot; entitled &quot;This Is What Happens When You Re-Upload a YouTube Video 1000 Times!&quot;, where he uploaded a video of himself speaking text similar to Lucier&#x27;s original to Youtube, then downloaded and re-uploaded it 1,000 times. This demonstrated the resulting digital artifacting of audio and video - specifically about YouTube in 2019.
