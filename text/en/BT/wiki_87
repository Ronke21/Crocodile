<doc id="582263" wikidata="Q733088" url="?curid=582263" title="Michelson interferometer">
<text>The Michelson interferometer is a common configuration for optical interferometry and was invented by the American physicist Albert Abraham Michelson in 1887. Using a beam splitter, a light source is split into two arms. Each of those light beams is reflected back toward the beamsplitter which then combines their amplitudes using the superposition principle. The resulting interference pattern that is not directed back toward the source is typically directed to some type of photoelectric detector or camera. For different applications of the interferometer, the two light paths can be with different lengths or incorporate optical elements or even materials under test.

The Michelson interferometer is employed in many scientific experiments and became well known for its use by Michelson and Edward Morley in the famous Michelson–Morley experiment (1887) in a configuration which would have detected the Earth&#x27;s motion through the supposed luminiferous aether that most physicists at the time believed was the medium in which light waves propagated. The null result of that experiment essentially disproved the existence of such an aether, leading eventually to the special theory of relativity and the revolution in physics at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 2015, another application of the Michelson interferometer, LIGO, made the first direct observation of gravitational waves. That observation confirmed an important prediction of general relativity, validating the theory&#x27;s prediction of space-time distortion in the context of large scale cosmic events (known as strong field tests).

==Configuration==

A Michelson interferometer consists minimally of mirrors &quot;M1&quot; &amp; &quot;M2&quot; and a beam splitter &quot;M&quot; (although a diffraction grating is also used).
In Fig 2, a source &quot;S&quot; emits light that hits the beam splitter (in this case, a plate beamsplitter) surface &quot;M&quot; at point &quot;C&quot;. &quot;M&quot; is partially reflective, so part of the light is transmitted through to point &quot;B&quot; while some is reflected in the direction of &quot;A&quot;. Both beams recombine at point &quot;C&#x27; &quot;to produce an interference pattern incident on the detector at point &quot;E&quot; (or on the retina of a person&#x27;s eye). If there is a slight angle between the two returning beams, for instance, then an imaging detector will record a sinusoidal &quot;fringe pattern&quot; as shown in Fig. 3b. If there is perfect spatial alignment between the returning beams, then there will not be any such pattern but rather a constant intensity over the beam dependent on the differential pathlength; this is difficult, requiring very precise control of the beam paths.

Fig. 2 shows use of a coherent (laser) source. Narrowband spectral light from a discharge or even white light can also be used, however to obtain significant interference contrast it is required that the differential pathlength is reduced below the coherence length of the light source. That can be only micrometers for white light, as discussed below.

If a lossless beamsplitter is employed, then one can show that optical energy is conserved. At every point on the interference pattern, the power that is &quot;not&quot; directed to the detector at &quot;E&quot; is rather present in a beam (not shown) returning in the direction of the source.

As shown in Fig. 3a and 3b, the observer has a direct view of mirror &quot;M1&quot; seen through the beam splitter, and sees a reflected image &quot;M&#x27;2&quot; of mirror &quot;M2&quot;. The fringes can be interpreted as the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images &quot;S&#x27;1&quot; and &quot;S&#x27;2&quot; of the original source &quot;S&quot;. The characteristics of the interference pattern depend on the nature of the light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter. In Fig. 3a, the optical elements are oriented so that &quot;S&#x27;1&quot; and &quot;S&#x27;2&quot; are in line with the observer, and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;M&#x27;2&quot; (fringes of equal inclination). If, as in Fig. 3b, &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;M&#x27;2&quot; are tilted with respect to each other, the interference fringes will generally take the shape of conic sections (hyperbolas), but if &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;M&#x27;2&quot; overlap, the fringes near the axis will be straight, parallel, and equally spaced (fringes of equal thickness). If S is an extended source rather than a point source as illustrated, the fringes of Fig. 3a must be observed with a telescope set at infinity, while the fringes of Fig. 3b will be localized on the mirrors.

==Source bandwidth==

White light has a tiny coherence length and is difficult to use in a Michelson (or Mach–Zehnder) interferometer. Even a narrowband (or &quot;quasi-monochromatic&quot;) spectral source requires careful attention to issues of chromatic dispersion when used to illuminate an interferometer. The two optical paths must be practically equal for all wavelengths present in the source. This requirement can be met if both light paths cross an equal thickness of glass of the same dispersion. In Fig. 4a, the horizontal beam crosses the beam splitter three times, while the vertical beam crosses the beam splitter once. To equalize the dispersion, a so-called compensating plate identical to the substrate of the beam splitter may be inserted into the path of the vertical beam. In Fig. 4b, we see using a cube beam splitter already equalizes the pathlengths in glass. The requirement for dispersion equalization is eliminated by using extremely narrowband light from a laser.

The extent of the fringes depends on the coherence length of the source. In Fig. 3b, the yellow sodium light used for the fringe illustration consists of a pair of closely spaced lines, D1 and D2, implying that the interference pattern will blur after several hundred fringes. Single longitudinal mode lasers are highly coherent and can produce high contrast interference with differential pathlengths of millions or even billions of wavelengths. On the other hand, using white (broadband) light, the central fringe is sharp, but away from the central fringe the fringes are colored and rapidly become indistinct to the eye.

Early experimentalists attempting to detect the Earth&#x27;s velocity relative to the supposed luminiferous aether, such as Michelson and Morley (1887) and Miller (1933), used quasi-monochromatic light only for initial alignment and coarse path equalization of the interferometer. Thereafter they switched to white (broadband) light, since using white light interferometry they could measure the point of &quot;absolute phase&quot; equalization (rather than phase modulo 2π), thus setting the two arms&#x27; pathlengths equal. More importantly, in a white light interferometer, any subsequent &quot;fringe jump&quot; (differential pathlength shift of one wavelength) would always be detected.

==Applications==

The Michelson interferometer configuration is used in a number of different applications.

===Fourier transform spectrometer===
Fig. 5 illustrates the operation of a Fourier transform spectrometer, which is essentially a Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum. Fourier transform spectrometers can offer significant advantages over dispersive (i.e., grating and prism) spectrometers under certain conditions. (1) The Michelson interferometer&#x27;s detector in effect monitors all wavelengths simultaneously throughout the entire measurement. When using a noisy detector, such as at infrared wavelengths, this offers an increase in signal-to-noise ratio while using only a single detector element; (2) the interferometer does not require a limited aperture as do grating or prism spectrometers, which require the incoming light to pass through a narrow slit in order to achieve high spectral resolution. This is an advantage when the incoming light is not of a single spatial mode. For more information, see Fellgett&#x27;s advantage.

===Twyman–Green interferometer===

The Twyman–Green interferometer is a variation of the Michelson interferometer used to test small optical components, invented and patented by Twyman and Green in 1916. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman–Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the available light sources had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by the limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman–Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson&#x27;s objections.

The use of a figured reference mirror in one arm allows the Twyman–Green interferometer to be used for testing various forms of optical component, such as lenses or telescope mirrors. Fig. 6 illustrates a Twyman–Green interferometer set up to test a lens. A point source of monochromatic light is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.

===Laser unequal path interferometer===
The &quot;LUPI&quot; is a Twyman–Green interferometer that uses a coherent laser light source. The high coherence length of a laser allows unequal path lengths in the test and reference arms and permits economical use of the Twyman–Green configuration in testing large optical components. A similar scheme has been used by Tajammal M in his PhD thesis (Manchester University UK, 1995) to balance two arms of an LDA system. This system used fibre optic direction coupler.

===Gravitational wave detection===

Michelson interferometry is the leading method for the direct detection of gravitational waves. This involves detecting tiny strains in space itself, affecting two long arms of the interferometer unequally, due to a strong passing gravitational wave. In 2015 the first detection of gravitational waves was accomplished using the two Michelson interferometers, each with 4 km arms, which comprise the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. This was the first experimental validation of gravitational waves, predicted by Albert Einstein&#x27;s General Theory of Relativity. With the addition of the Virgo interferometer in Europe, it became possible to calculate the direction from which the gravitational waves originate, using the tiny arrival-time differences between the three detectors. In 2020, India was constructing a fourth Michelson interferometer for gravitational wave detection.

===Miscellaneous applications===

Fig. 7 illustrates use of a Michelson interferometer as a tunable narrow band filter to create dopplergrams of the Sun&#x27;s surface. When used as a tunable narrow band filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of advantages and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range, and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance. The reliability of Michelson interferometers has tended to favor their use in space applications, while the broad wavelength range and overall simplicity of Fabry–Pérot interferometers has favored their use in ground-based systems.
Another application of the Michelson interferometer is in optical coherence tomography (OCT), a medical imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig. 8, the core of a typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.

Others applications include delay line interferometer which convert phase modulation into amplitude modulation in DWDM networks, the characterization of high-frequency circuits, and low-cost THz power generation.

===Atmospheric and space applications===
The Michelson Interferometer has played an important role in studies of the upper atmosphere, revealing temperatures and winds, employing both space-borne, and ground-based instruments, by measuring the Doppler widths and shifts in the spectra of airglow and aurora. For example, the Wind Imaging Interferometer, WINDII, on the Upper
Atmosphere Research Satellite, UARS, (launched on September 12, 1991) measured the global wind and temperature patterns from 80 to 300 km by using the visible airglow emission from these altitudes as a target and employing optical Doppler interferometry to measure the small wavelength shifts of the narrow atomic and molecular airglow emission lines induced by the
bulk velocity of the atmosphere carrying the emitting species. The instrument was an all-glass field-widened achromatically and thermally compensated phase-stepping Michelson interferometer, along with a bare CCD detector that imaged the airglow limb through the interferometer. A sequence of phase-stepped images was processed to derive the wind velocity for two orthogonal view directions, yielding the horizontal wind vector.

The principle of using a polarizing Michelson Interferometer as a narrow band filter was first described by Evans who developed a birefringent photometer where the incoming light is split into two orthogonally polarized components by a polarizing beam splitter, sandwiched between two halves of a Michelson cube. This led to the first polarizing wide-field Michelson interferometer described by Title and Ramsey which was used for solar observations; and led to the development of a refined instrument applied to measurements of oscillations in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere, employing a network of observatories around the Earth known as the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG).
The Polarizing Atmospheric Michelson Interferometer, PAMI, developed by Bird et al., and discussed in &quot;Spectral Imaging of the Atmosphere&quot;, combines the polarization tuning technique of Title and Ramsey with the Shepherd &quot;et al.&quot; technique of deriving winds and temperatures from emission rate measurements at sequential path differences, but the scanning system used by PAMI is much simpler than the moving mirror systems in that it has no internal moving parts, instead scanning with a polarizer external to the interferometer. The PAMI was demonstrated in an observation campaign where its performance was compared to a Fabry–Pérot spectrometer, and employed to measure E-region winds.

More recently, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), on the Solar Dynamics Observatory, employs two Michelson Interferometers with a polarizer and other tunable elements, to study solar variability and to characterize the Sun&#x27;s interior along with the various components of magnetic activity. HMI takes high-resolution measurements of the longitudinal and vector magnetic field over the entire visible disk thus extending the capabilities of its predecessor, the SOHO&#x27;s MDI instrument (See Fig. 9). HMI produces data to determine the interior sources and mechanisms of solar variability and how the physical processes inside the Sun are related to surface magnetic field and activity. It also produces data to enable estimates of the coronal magnetic field for studies of variability in the extended solar atmosphere. HMI observations will help establish the relationships between the internal dynamics and magnetic activity in order to understand solar variability and its effects.

In one example of the use of the MDI, Stanford scientists reported the detection of several sunspot regions in the deep interior of the Sun, 1–2 days before they appeared on the solar disc. The detection of sunspots in the solar interior may thus provide valuable warnings about upcoming surface magnetic activity which could be used to improve and extend the predictions of space weather forecasts.

== Technical topics ==
===Step-phase interferometer===
This is a Michelson interferometer in which the mirror in one arm is replaced with a Gires–Tournois etalon. The highly dispersed wave reflected by the Gires–Tournois etalon interferes with the original wave as reflected by the other mirror. Because the phase change from the Gires–Tournois etalon is an almost step-like function of wavelength, the resulting interferometer has special characteristics. It has an application in fiber-optic communications as an optical interleaver.

Both mirrors in a Michelson interferometer can be replaced with Gires–Tournois etalons. The step-like relation of phase to wavelength is thereby more pronounced, and this can be used to construct an asymmetric optical interleaver.

===Phase-conjugating interferometry ===
The reflection from phase-conjugating mirror of two light beams inverses their phase difference 
formula_1 to the opposite one formula_2. For this reason the interference pattern in twin-beam interferometer changes drastically. Compared to conventional Michelson interference curve with period of half-wavelength formula_3:
formula_4
where formula_5 is second-order correlation function, the interference curve in phase-conjugating interferometer 
has much longer period defined by frequency shift formula_6 of reflected beams:
formula_7
where visibility curve is nonzero when optical path difference formula_8 exceeds coherence length of light beams. 
The nontrivial features of phase fluctuations in optical phase-conjugating mirror had been studied via Michelson interferometer with two independent PC-mirrors 
. The phase-conjugating Michelson interferometry is a promising technology for coherent summation of laser amplifiers.
Constructive interference in an array containing formula_9 beamsplitters of formula_10 laser beams synchronized by 
phase conjugation
may increase the brightness of amplified beams as formula_11.

<text>The Gainesville Sun () is a newspaper published daily in Gainesville, Florida, United States, covering the North-Central portion of the state.

==History==
The paper was founded in July 1876 as the Gainesville Times, by brothers E. M. and William Wade Hampton, and was renamed as &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; in February 1879. The paper was first printed on July 6, 1876. It went through a series of ownership and name changes in the 1880s and 1890s, first being consolidated with Henry Hamilton McCreary&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Bee&quot; as the Gainesville Sun and Bee, then as the Gainesville Daily Sun, and finally back to the &quot;Gainesville Sun&quot;.

It was bought by W.M. Pepper Sr., in 1917 for $50,000, and was published by the Pepper family for three generations, until it was sold to the Cowles Media Company in 1962. During the time it was owned by the Pepper family (specifically in 1922) an editor at the paper openly admitted his membership in the Ku Klux Klan and praised the Klan in print. This attitude helps to explain the editorial published in the paper following the Rosewood massacre justifying the actions of the whites, saying &quot;Let it be understood now and forever that he, whether white or black, who brutally assaults an innocent and helpless woman, shall die the death of a dog.&quot; Conversely, the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; of the time called it &quot;a lasting blot on the people of Levy county&quot;, clearly condemning rather than justifying the massacre.

In 1971, it was sold to The New York Times Company. On January 6, 2012, &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; was purchased by Halifax Media Group. In 2015, Halifax was acquired by New Media Investment Group.

An online edition was launched in 1995, initially called &quot;SunOne&quot;, and later simply &quot;GainesvilleSun.com&quot;. The website is now known as Gainesville.com. In 2005, it launched &quot;The Gainesville Guardian&quot;, a weekly paper aimed at East Gainesville and the city&#x27;s African-American population, to mixed opinions.

==Awards==
&quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; has won two Pulitzer Prizes: publisher John R. Harrison won in 1966 for his campaign for better housing codes, and editorialist Horance G. &quot;Buddy&quot; Davis Jr. won in 1971 for his editorials in support of peaceful desegregation of the local school system.

<doc id="582273" wikidata="Q1327735" url="?curid=582273" title="Hydraulic diameter">
<text>The hydraulic diameter, , is a commonly used term when handling flow in non-circular tubes and channels. Using this term, one can calculate many things in the same way as for a round tube. When the cross-section is uniform along the tube or channel length, it is defined as

:formula_1

where
: is the cross-sectional area of the flow,
: is the wetted perimeter of the cross-section.

More intuitively, the hydraulic diameter can be understood as a function of the hydraulic radius , which is defined as the cross-sectional area of the channel divided by the wetted perimeter. Here, the wetted perimeter includes all surfaces acted upon by shear stress from the fluid.

:formula_2

:formula_3

Note that for the case of a circular pipe,
:formula_4

The need for the hydraulic diameter arises due to the use of a single dimension in the case of a dimensionless quantity such as the Reynolds number, which prefers a single variable for flow analysis rather than the set of variables as listed in the table below. The Manning formula contains a quantity called the hydraulic radius. Despite what the name may suggest, the hydraulic diameter is &quot;not&quot; twice the hydraulic radius, but four times larger.

Hydraulic diameter is mainly used for calculations involving turbulent flow. Secondary flows can be observed in non-circular ducts as a result of turbulent shear stress in the turbulent flow. Hydraulic diameter is also used in calculation of heat transfer in internal-flow problems.

==Non-uniform and non-circular cross-section channels==
In the more general case, channels with non-uniform non-circular cross-sectional area, such as the Tesla valve, the hydraulic diameter is defined as:

:formula_5

where
: is the total wetted volume of the channel,
: is the total wetted surface area.
This definition is reduced to formula_6 for uniform non-circular cross-section channels, and formula_7 for circular pipes.

==List of hydraulic diameters==

For a fully filled duct or pipe whose cross-section is a convex regular polygon, the hydraulic diameter is equivalent to the diameter formula_8 of a circle inscribed within the wetted perimeter.
This can be seen as follows: The formula_9-sided regular polygon is a union of formula_9 triangles, each of height formula_11 and base formula_12.
Each such triangle contributes formula_13 to the total area and formula_14 to the total perimeter, giving

:formula_15

for the hydraulic diameter.

<doc id="582279" wikidata="Q18243667" url="?curid=582279" title="Covenant (Halo)">
<text>The Covenant is a fictional military alliance of various alien species and serves as one of the primary antagonists in the &quot;Halo&quot; science fiction series. The Covenant are composed of a variety of diverse species, united under the religious worship of the enigmatic Forerunners and their belief that Forerunner ringworlds known as Halos will provide a path to salvation. After the Covenant leadership – the High Prophets – declare humanity an affront to their gods, the Covenant prosecute a lengthy genocidal campaign against the technologically inferior race.

The Covenant were first introduced in the 2001 video game &quot;&quot; as enemies hunting the player character, a human supersoldier known as Master Chief. Not realizing the Halos were meant as weapons of destruction rather than salvation, the Covenant attempt to activate the rings on three separate occasions throughout the series, inadvertently releasing a virulent parasite known as the Flood in the process.

To develop a distinctive look for the various races of the Covenant, Bungie artists drew inspiration from reptilian, ursine, and avian characteristics. A Covenant design scheme of purples and reflective surfaces was made to separate the aliens from human architecture.

==Overview==
In the primary 26th century setting of &quot;Halo&quot;, humanity and the Covenant meet for the first time in the year 2525. Searching for relics left behind by their gods, the Forerunners, the Covenant stumble across humans at the colony world of Harvest. The Covenant leadership discovers that the Forerunners designated humanity &quot;reclaimers&quot; of their legacy, and that the Covenant religion is built on falsehoods; to prevent the truth from being uncovered, they instigate a genocidal war against humanity.

The Covenant&#x27;s superior technology gives them a distinct advantage in the war. In 2552, the Covenant discover and destroy Reach, one of humanity&#x27;s greatest military strongholds. A human ship fleeing the battle discovers a Forerunner ringworld, Halo. The Covenant believe the activation of these rings are key to bringing about salvation, but the ring is destroyed by the human supersoldier Master Chief. Soon after, the Covenant falls into civil war as the truth of the Halo rings&#x27; purpose is revealed: they are actually weapons of mass destruction built to stop the spread of the parasitic Flood. The disgraced Covenant commander known as the Arbiter allies with the Master Chief to stop the Covenant and Flood, ending the Human-Covenant War. In the post-war era, various factions replace the power vacuum left by the Covenant; these include the Banished, who feature as primary antagonists in &quot;Halo Infinite&quot;.

==Game development==
Throughout much of the development of &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, very little concrete story details had been developed for the story campaign, and what trials the player character would face. Writer Joseph Staten and other Bungie staff came up with the idea of a coalition of alien races, subsequently deciding that the faction would be motivated by religion. During the course of development of &quot;Halo&quot;, the designers decided upon three &quot;schools&quot; of architecture, for each of the factions represented – humans, Covenant, and Forerunners. For the Covenant, the team decided on &quot;sleek and shiny&quot;, with reflective surfaces, organic shapes, and use of purples. According to art director Marcus Lehto, the principle designs for the faction came from environmental artist Paul Russell, while concept artist Shi Kai Wang was instrumental in developing the look of the various races within the Covenant. Armor color was used to denote ranks of enemies.

Like the character designs, Covenant technology, architecture, and design continually changed throughout development, occasionally for practical reasons as well as aesthetics. According to Eric Arroyo, the Covenant cruiser &quot;Truth and Reconciliation&quot;, which plays a major role in &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, was to be boarded by the player by a long ramp. However due to technical considerations of having a fully textured ship so close to the player, the designers came up with a &quot;gravity lift&quot;, which allowed the ship to be farther away (thus not requiring as much processing power for detail) as well as adding a &quot;visually interesting&quot; component of Covenant technology.

The art team also spent a large amount of time on Covenant weaponry, in order to make them suitably alien yet still recognizable to players. At the same time, the designers wanted all aspects of Covenant technology, especially the vehicles, to act plausibly. In contrast to human weapons firing projectiles, many of the Covenant&#x27;s weaponry are depicted as firing plasma. A few of the Covenant&#x27;s weapons are not plasma-based, including the Needler, which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of homing at organic foes. A weapons expert noted parallels between the Needler and ancient Greek Amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon. Bungie designed the majority of Covenant technology to mirror the aesthetic of the Elites; the exteriors are sleek and graceful, with a more angular and complex core underneath hinting at the Forerunner origins of the technology.

===Species===
Covenant society is depicted as a caste system composed of different species. Bungie&#x27;s artists looked at live animals and films for inspiration; as a result, the species within the Covenant bear simian, reptilian, avian, and ursine characteristics. Concept artist Shi Kai Wang focused on making each enemy seem appropriate to its role in gameplay. The species within the Covenant include:

*Sangheili (called Elites in Human language) who stand nearly 8&#x27;6″″ (2.6 m) and feature recharging personal shields. The Sangheili initially had simple mouths, which developed into pairs of split mandibles substituting for the lower jaws. Bungie concept artist Shi Kai Wang noted that project lead Jason Jones had been insistent on giving the Sangheili a tail. While Wang thought it made the aliens look too animalistic, the idea was dropped due to practical considerations, including where the tail would go when the Sangheili were driving vehicles. According to Paul Russel, when Bungie was bought by Microsoft and &quot;Halo&quot; was turned into an Xbox launch title, Microsoft took issue with the design of the Sangheili, as they felt that the Sangheili had a resemblance to cats that might alienate Japanese consumers.
*Unggoy (Grunts in Human language), are commonly depicted as basic foot soldiers. Squat and cowardly fighters, Unggoy panic and run if players kill their leaders.
*Kig-Yar (Jackals in Human language) carry energy shields or ranged weaponry. In some cases, such as with the Kig-Yar, the overall design was honed once the enemy&#x27;s role was clearly defined.
*Mgalekgolo (Hunters in Human language) are collectives species of pseudo annelid creatures that physically shape their colonies in both powerful and practical ways. encased in tough armor. Initial concepts were less humanoid-looking and softer than the final shape, with angular shields and razor-sharp spines.
*San’Shyuum (Prophets in Human language) serve as the supreme rulers of the Covenant, and were primarily designed by Shi Kai Wang and Eric Arroyo. Originally, the San’Shyuum were built in a more unified way, with the gravity thrones they used for flotation and movement fused with the Prophet&#x27;s organic structures. The characters were also designed to be feeble, yet sinister. The three Prophet Hierarchs were each individually designed.
*Jiralhanae (Brutes in Human language) are even more physically imposing than the Sangheili, with their society organized around tribal chieftains. Inspired by the animators watching biker films, the Jiralhanae incorporated simian and ursine elements while retaining an alien look. Wang&#x27;s final concept for the creatures in &quot;Halo 2&quot;, replete with bandoliers and human skulls, was simplified for the game. Jiralhanae were meant to typify the abusive alien menace of the Covenant and in the words of design lead Jaime Griesemer, to serve as &quot;barbarians in Rome&quot;.

Other members of the Covenant include insectoid Yanme&#x27;e (Drones); the animators found the creatures challenging, as they had to be animated to walk, run, crawl, or fly on multiple surfaces. Old concept art from &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; was repurposed in influencing the Yanme&#x27;e final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps. Cut from &quot;Combat Evolved&quot; were floating support workers known as The Huragok (Engineers) , actually constructed machines rather than organic creatures. They later made appearances in &quot;Halo Wars&quot;, &quot;Halo 3: ODST&quot;, &quot;Halo Reach&quot; and &quot;Halo Wars 2&quot; as well as various novels.

With subsequent games, the Covenant and their look were changed or refined to account for increased graphic hardware or gameplay needs. In &quot;Halo 3&quot;, the Jiralhanae became the primary enemy, and they were heavily redesigned. Concept artists took inspiration from rhinoceroses and gorillas, and armored them with buckles and clothing to represent a different aesthetic look compared to the Covenant. Weaponry was designed to reflect the Jiralhanae’s &quot;souls&quot; distilled to its purest form – conveyed by dangerous shapes, harsh colors, and objects that looked &quot;dangerous to be around&quot;. The more seasoned the Brute, the more ornate clothing and helmets; the armor was designed to convey a culture and tradition to the species, and emphasize their mass and power. Designs for &quot;Halo 3&quot; took cues from ancient Greek Spartans. Character animators recorded intended actions for the new Jiralhanae in a padded room at Bungie. A new addition to the Jiralhanae artificial intelligence was a pack mentality; leader Brutes direct large-scale actions simultaneously, such as throwing grenades towards a player.

&quot;&quot; served as a prequel to &quot;Halo: Combat Evolved&quot;, and creative director Marcus Lehto pushed for the team to revamp the Covenant. The aliens&#x27; translated English was replaced with untranslated, guttural alien sounds, and their look and weaponry was redesigned. The goal was to make the Covenant intimidating and more alien to players.

==Analysis==
The Covenant serve as one of a number of religious allusions in &quot;Halo&quot;. Their name refers to sacred agreements between the people of Israel and their God in Jewish and Christian tradition, and could be used to indicate the attitude of superiority complex the aliens have to the inferior and sacrilegious humans. The Covenant&#x27;s ships bear names referring to elements of Judeo-Christian religion. A review of religions and religious material in video games noted that the Covenant&#x27;s invented religion had many similarities to those in similar games, and would likely be called a cult in the real world. The thematic parallels of religious zealots fighting an American military metaphor was not lost on Microsoft&#x27;s content review team, who forced a name change of the holy warrior &quot;Dervish&quot; to Arbiter before the release of &quot;Halo 2&quot;. Theologian P.C.J.M. Paulissen notes that while on the surface the &quot;Halo&quot; games present a conflict between rational humans and religious alien fanaticism, the comparison is complicated by the technical superiority of the Covenant (they wield energy weapons compared to primitive human ballistics) and the games seem to reject the idea science and religion are rigidly disconnected.

==Cultural impact==
===Merchandise===
Microsoft has commissioned multiple sets of action figures and merchandise featuring Covenant characters for each video game. The &quot;Halo 3&quot; action figure sets have been made by McFarlane Toys, and include Brutes and Jackals. The Covenant&#x27;s weaponry has also been adapted into large-scale replicas.

===Reception===
The Covenant were positively received in &quot;Combat Evolved&quot;, with their artificial intelligence praised and the different tactics needed to defeat each enemy type commended.

The ability to experience the storyline of &quot;Halo 2&quot; from the Covenant perspective was described as a &quot;brilliant stroke of game design&quot;. Allowing the player to assume the role of a Sangheili who was described as providing an unexpected plot twist, and allowing the player to experience a &quot;newfound complexity to the story&quot;. In addition, some reviewers thought that this provided the series with a significant plot element – IGN referred to it as the &quot;intriguing side story of Thel &#x27;Vadam and his Sangheili&quot; – and its elimination in &quot;Halo 3&quot; was pointed to as responsible for reducing the role of the Arbiter within the series plot. &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; listed Covenant as 16th in their list of top 50 Villains.

<text>Deauville () is a commune in the Calvados department, Normandy, northwestern France. Major attractions include its harbour, race course, marinas, conference centre, villas, Grand Casino, and hotels. The first Deauville Asian Film Festival took place in 1999. As the closest seaside resort to Paris, Deauville is one of the most notable seaside resorts in France. The city and its region of the &quot;Côte Fleurie&quot; (&quot;Flowery Coast&quot;) have long been home to the French upper class&#x27;s seaside houses and is often referred to as the &quot;Parisian riviera&quot;.

Since the 19th century, the town of Deauville has been a fashionable holiday resort for the international upper class. In France, it is perhaps most well-known for its role in Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

==History==
The history of Deauville can be traced back to 1060, when seigneur Hubert du Mont-Canisy controlled the land, which was previously known as Auevilla. In 1066, Hubert du Mont-Canisy left to follow William the Conqueror to England.
Until 1860, Deauville was led by a series of mayors and slowly gained renown for its horse farming and for cultivating sainfoin. Duc Charles Auguste Louis Joseph de Morny, the half brother of the emperor Napoleon III, transformed Deauville into a more travelled resort on request of his wife Sofia Sergeyevna Trubetskaya and her friend, art collector Konstantin Rudanovsky.
Before the death of the Duc in 1865, certain key investments were made that would transform Deauville&#x27;s history, including a railway from Paris to Deauville, the Deauville hippodrome, and a small casino. Within three years, over forty villas were constructed in the surrounding area, and 200 rooms, as well as other accommodations, were finalized in the Grand Hotel. the Duc de Morny also established the construction of a church and a school in 1863. In the same year, &quot;La Terrasse&quot; was created. La Terrasse was a complex for hydrotherapeutic baths and other cures, as well as a 1,800-metre promenade along the seaside.
Following the Duc&#x27;s death, Deauville grew gradually, but it was not until the early 20th century when Désiré le Hoc and Eugene Cornuché, pushed Deauville into another period of transformation and development.
The still-famous Normandy Barrière and Royal hotels and the casino opened in the years 1911 and 1913. Renovations were carried out and extensions were made to the hippodrome, telephone lines were set up, the sales of yearlings saw historic highs, and up to 62 English and French yachts occupied the basin. During these years many luxury boutiques opened in the streets of Deauville, including Coco Chanel&#x27;s first shop; many stores from Paris decided it was worthwhile establishing themselves in the up-and-coming resort.

During World War I, wounded soldiers would be cared for in Deauville&#x27;s hotels and casino. The war also took a heavy toll on Deauville&#x27;s blossoming market and trade sector, as merchants were forced to dedicate many of their products to the war effort.

* In 1923, the &quot;Promenade des Planches&quot; was created and finalized. This refers to the wooded boardwalk that parallels the seaside.
* In 1926, Eugene Corniché died. His position as director of Deauville&#x27;s grand establishments was filled by Francois André.
* In 1929, the construction of l&quot;Hotel du Golf was paired with major renovations and expansions to the golf course itself, as decided by Francois André. The hotel and golf course are situated on the outskirts of the town.
* In 1931, only seven kilometres from the centre of town, Deauville – Saint-Gatien Airport was inaugurated. This was a pivotal event in the Deauville&#x27;s history, specifically in terms of tourism, as now London was only a 2-hour trip from Deauville.
* On the 19th of July 1936, the Deauville Grand Prix was held on a 3.7 kilometre circuit which used the road along the seafront and the Boulevard Eugène Cornuché. Drivers and spectators had reservations about the narrowness of the circuits and the sharp 90-degree corners. Approaching three-quarter distance, the E.R.A. of Marcel Lehoux clipped the wheel of the Alfa Romeo driven by Giuseppe Farina, resulting in both cars crashing. Farina was not seriously injured, but Lehoux was thrown out of his car, suffering a fractured skull, and dying on the way to the hospital. Earlier in the race, Albert Chambost had crashed his Maserati. He was seriously injured, and succumbed to his injuries in hospital a few days later. This was the only running of the Deauville Grand Prix.

The combination of the national financial crisis and World War II ensured Deauville would not regain its stature as a resort town until the 1950s. During the Second World War, the German Army occupied Deauville. Villas, hotels, and the casino were all occupied or used to some extent by the German forces. Following the invasion of allied forces on D-Day, the German troops were pushed out of Deauville and Normandy.

Following the war, Deauville leaned into its reputation for myth and exclusivity. Michel d&#x27;Ornano was established as the new mayor and Lucien Barriere succeeded his uncle Francois André at the head of the Hotels and Casinos of Deauville, and the town again became a centre for high society and celebrities. With scenes of award-winning movies being filmed in Deauville (such as Claude Lelouch&#x27;s &quot;un Homme et une Femme&quot;) and consistent celebrity traffic, the town has renewed its status as an emblematic resort town of Europe.

===Early history===
The first reference to Deauville was in 1060. At this time the village was called A Enilla and resembled a fishing hamlet. &quot;A Enilla&quot; comes from the Germanic &quot;Auwja Auwa&quot;, meaning &quot;wet meadow&quot;. The village was originally up on a hill and a few houses were built next to the St. Laurent chapel. Thanks to its situation near the coast, the village had a small harbour of little importance on the river Touques.

====Duc de Morny====
Deauville owes its greater prominence to the Duc de Morny. He described the village as: &quot;Cité calme, aux rue désertes, elle forme avec Trouville, animée et bruyante, un contraste absolu. Mais ce manque de vie n&#x27;est, en réalité, qu&#x27;apparent, car de magnifiques propriétés, de même que les délicieux jardins qui les entourent, sont entretnus avec un soin on ne peut plus raffiné.&quot; In English: &quot;A quiet town, with deserted streets, it forms a complete contrast with the busy and noisy Trouville. But this lack of life is, in reality, only apparent, because the magnificent properties, and their delicious gardens, are maintained with a care that could not be more refined.&quot;

====Development====

In 1855 land was being bought at 5 centimes/m2; in 1862 the same land was worth 1 franc/m2, representing the transition from marsh to buildable land.

It was in 1858 that doctor Oliffe, who owned a villa in Trouville, decided to create a &quot;town of pleasure&quot; on the sand dunes and in 1862 the first stone of today&#x27;s Deauville was laid.

Together with banker Armand Donon, the duc bought 2.4 square kilometres of marsh and dunes for 800,000 francs. The Touques was still unchannelled but during the Second Empire the low tides permitted the construction of walls.
In the 1860s visits by Napoleon III made the coast of Normandy adjacent to Deauville fashionable, and soon speculators developed the infrastructure necessary to accommodate members of the Imperial court and the growing Parisian bourgeoisie.

The railway arrived at Trouville-sur-Mer in 1863. Using Trouville station, passengers could reach Deauville in six hours from Paris. Morny, who had influence at Court, had a hand in persuading the aristocracy that staying on the coast would benefit their health. Land was bought and large villas or even palaces were built. A casino and hotels soon followed, and rich tourists came in numbers. A common old joke among locals is that the wealthy bourgeoisie Frenchmen would keep their wife in Deauville and their mistress in Trouville, making light of the disparate socioeconomic statuses of Trouville, being a working class fishing village and Deauville, being home to exclusive shops and expensive real estate.

The locked harbour was excavated in 1866.

Deauville was left mostly unscathed during the First World War. It was during World War II and German Occupation that Deauville saw most of its leisure properties confiscated for use by the occupying force.

=== Modern times ===
During the 1960s, Deauville started to see more mass-market visitors. Nonetheless, the town and the surrounding coastline still contain high-profile seaside resorts, haven for the rich and famous as well as for the more discreet families of French high society such as the Rothschilds, who own a Norman manor near Deauville.
Today, Deauville is easily accessible from Paris, in large part due to the extension of highway A132. From 26–27 May 2011, Deauville hosted the 37th G8 summit.

===Deauville American Film Festival===
In an effort to prolong the summer season, Lucien Barriere and Michel d&#x27;Ornano agreed to sponsor Lionel Chouchan and Andre Halimi&#x27;s idea of a film festival that specifically promoted American films, including both big-budget and independent features.

The festival was established in 1975 and &quot;The Reincarnation of Peter Proud&quot; was the first film to be shown in the festival&#x27;s history. Since then, the festival has continued to promote American cinematography and bring American and European stars to Normandy. The festival, not known for its competitive nature, began to hand out awards in 1995. In 2014 the Festival celebrated its 40th year.

===Horse culture===
Home to the Deauville-La Touques Racecourse, the countryside around Deauville is the main horse breeding region in France and home to numerous stud farms. As a result, the city is twinned with Lexington, Kentucky and County Kildare in Ireland, both of which are world leaders in breeding thoroughbred racehorses. The important Ventes de Deauville yearling auction is held in mid-August each year at Deauville.

Deauville is internationally known for its horse culture, its famous tracks, Yearling sales and its multiple Group One annual races. The two famous tracks of Deauville are Deauville la Touques and Clairefontaine: these tracks are active during the months of January, July, August, October, and December.

The three most important races that occur in Deauville ever year are Le Maurice de Gheest, Le Jacques le Marois, and Le Morny. More recently, Le Prix d&#x27;Astarte, (Prix Rothschild) and Le Prix Romanet have gained more prestige in the racing world. Le Grand Prix de Deauville, though not a Group One race, remains very prestigious; since its origin the winner&#x27;s names and emblems are posted on the walls of the grand hall of the race track.

Today Deauville also hosts competitions other than racing. These competitions include polo tournaments, horse shows, and the European Championship of Miniature Horses.

The first of the James Bond series largely takes part in a Casino – Fleming had played at Deauville as a young man, and sets his tale of Bond versus Soviet agents in a fictional French gambling resort, drawing parallels with an actual World War II visit he had made to a Portuguese casino (Palacio Estoril) whilst working for the British secret service.

* Deauville was the setting for part of &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;.
* Deauville, together with Cabourg and Trouville, provides the basis for the Norman coastal resort of Balbec in Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;A La Recherche du Temps Perdu&quot; (Remembrance of Things Past). For a discussion of Proust&#x27;s use of Norman locations and the interplay between the social structures of his novel and the region&#x27;s place in French social history, see https://web.archive.org/web/20070620072342/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-925688-8.pdf

<text>Villette ( ) is an 1853 novel written by English author Charlotte Brontë. After an unspecified family disaster, the protagonist Lucy Snowe travels from her native England to the fictional Continental city of Villette to teach at a girls&#x27; school, where she is drawn into adventure and romance.

&quot;Villette&quot; was Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s third and last novel published during her life. It was preceded in writing by &quot;The Professor&quot; (her posthumously published first novel, of which &quot;Villette&quot; is a reworking, though still not very similar), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, and &quot;Shirley&quot;.

==Author&#x27;s background==
In 1842 Charlotte Brontë, at the age of 26, travelled to Brussels, Belgium, with her sister Emily. There they enrolled in a &quot;pensionnat&quot; (boarding school) run by M. and Mme. Constantin Heger. In return for board and tuition, Charlotte taught English and Emily taught music.

The sisters&#x27; time at the &quot;pensionnat&quot; was cut short when their aunt, Elizabeth Branwell, died in October 1842. Elizabeth had joined the Brontë family to care for the children after the death of her sister, their mother Maria Brontë, née Maria Branwell.

Charlotte returned, alone, to Brussels in January 1843 to take up a teaching post at the &quot;pensionnat&quot;. Her second stay in Brussels was not a happy one. She became lonely and homesick, and fell in love with M. Héger, a married man. She finally returned to her family&#x27;s rectory in Haworth, England, in January 1844.

Charlotte drew on this source material for her first (albeit unsuccessful) novel &quot;The Professor&quot;. After several publishers had rejected it, Brontë reworked the material and made it the basis of &quot;Villette&quot;. Most literary historians believe that the character of M. Paul Emanuel is closely based upon that of M. Héger. Furthermore, the character of Graham Bretton is widely acknowledged to have been modelled upon Brontë&#x27;s publisher, George Murray Smith.

==Locale==
The novel is initially set in the English countryside, and later follows Lucy Snowe, the main character to the fictional town of Villette, a Gothic town where the majority of the action takes place. Villette is modelled upon the city of Brussels and is set in the fictional French-speaking kingdom of Labassecour (modelled on Belgium). &quot;La &quot; is French for &quot;the farmyard&quot;.

==Characters==
Lucy Snowe: The narrator and main character of &quot;Villette&quot;. A quiet, self-reliant, intelligent, 23-year-old woman. Lucy has, as Miss Ginevra Fanshawe asserts, &quot;no attractive accomplishments – no beauty&quot; as Lucy does her best not to stand out or form attachments. Although she seems to lack any living relatives, she is the god-daughter of Mrs. Bretton.

Though usually reserved and emotionally self-controlled, Lucy has strong feelings and affections for those whom she really values. She even sincerely cares for the giddy Ginevra, albeit in a blunt, curmudgeonly fashion. She is a firm Protestant and denounces Roman Catholicism as false (&quot;God is not with Rome&quot;). She falls in love with M. Emanuel and consents to marry him someday. With his help Lucy leaves Madame Beck&#x27;s and establishes her own school.

M. Paul Emanuel: An irascible, autocratic &quot;professeur&quot; at Madame Beck&#x27;s &quot;pensionnat&quot;. He is also a relative of Madame Beck. Although he insults Lucy frequently, Lucy comes to relish his good qualities. He is generous; he delights in giving Lucy secret presents. He is kind and magnanimous, as is shown by his supporting and sheltering the elderly grandmother of his dead fiancée, Justine Marie, together with his former tutor (Père Silas) and a servant. He is a devout Catholic and tries to convert Lucy, a Protestant, to Catholicism but fails. As he grows closer to Lucy and falls in love with her everyone in his life attempts to keep them apart, and he is eventually banished to a family-owned plantation in Guadeloupe for three years. At the end of the novel, it is strongly hinted that he dies in a shipwreck attempting to return to Labassecour.

Dr. John Graham Bretton: A handsome young English gentleman who is a physician. He is the son of Lucy&#x27;s godmother, Mrs. Bretton. He is described as &quot;cheerful,&quot; &quot;benignant,&quot; and &quot;bland.&quot; Lucy, when young, showed no particular fondness for him. However, when they meet again ten years later, their cool friendship is more than rekindled, and Lucy secretly begins to cherish an affection for him. Graham does not return this affection, however, and calls her &quot;quiet Lucy Snowe&quot; and &quot;a being inoffensive as a shadow.&quot; He has, at first, a passion for Ginevra Fanshawe, until her love of money and a sneer at Mrs. Bretton quenches his love at last. He then falls in love with Polly de Bassompierre. Lucy conquers her love for him and buries all his treasured letters to her, saying, &quot;Good-night, Dr. John; you are good, you are beautiful but you are not mine. Good-night, and God bless you!&quot; John and Polly eventually marry and live a happy life together.

Mrs. Louisa Bretton: Dr. John Graham Bretton&#x27;s mother and Lucy&#x27;s godmother. She is a widow and has &quot;health without flaw, and her spirits of that tone and equality which are better than a fortune to the possessor.&quot; She is immensely proud of her son but is not above teasing him.

Polly Home/Countess Paulina Mary de Bassompierre: A 17-year-old English girl who is a cousin of Ginevra Fanshawe. She is first introduced to the story as a very young girl, who is called Polly. As a child, she was very fond of Graham Bretton. She grows to be a beautiful young lady who is delicate and intelligent. Upon meeting Graham again, their friendship develops into love, and they eventually marry. Lucy says of her, &quot;She looked a mere doll,&quot; and describes her as shaped like &quot;a model.&quot; She and Lucy are friends. Although Lucy is often pained by Polly&#x27;s relationship with Graham, she looks upon their happiness without a grudge.

Mr. Home/Count de Bassompierre: Polly&#x27;s father, who inherited his noble title within recent years. He is a sensitive and thoughtful man who loves his daughter. When he notices Polly&#x27;s relationship with Graham, he has difficulty recognising and accepting that his daughter is now a grown woman. He regards her as a mere child and calls her his &quot;little treasure&quot; or &quot;little Polly.&quot; He at last relinquishes Polly to Graham, saying, &quot;May God deal with you as you deal with her!&quot; He lives to a ripe old age.

Ginevra Fanshawe: A beautiful but shallow and vain 18-year-old English girl with a light, careless temperament. She is an incorrigible coquette and has a relish for flirtation. Although related to the Homes/Bassonpierres her own family is not wealthy, and she expects others to finance her lavish tastes. Lucy meets her on a ship journeying to France. Ginevra is a student at Madame Beck&#x27;s, and it is her passing remark, &quot;I wish you would come to Madame Beck&#x27;s; she has some marmots [Fr. &quot;kids&quot;] you might look after: she wants an English gouvernante, or was wanting one two months ago,&quot; which prompts Lucy to go to Villette. Despite Ginevra&#x27;s faults, Lucy has a certain fondness for her. Ginevra thinks of Lucy as &quot;caustic, ironic, and cynical,&quot; calling her &quot;old lady,&quot; &quot;dear crosspatch,&quot; and most frequently &quot;Timon&quot; (after a Greek misanthrope who lived during the 5th century BC). Ginevra uses Graham shamelessly until he loses interest in her. She eventually elopes with and marries Count Alfred de Hamal and keeps in touch with Lucy via letters.

Count Alfred de Hamal: A colonel-count, Ginevra&#x27;s suitor, has a Continental appearance with delicate features. Ginevra Fanshawe states &quot;Colonel de Hamal is a gentleman of excellent connections, perfect manners, sweet appearance, with pale interesting face, and hair and eyes like an Italian. Then too he is the most delightful company possible—a man quite in my way; not sensible and serious like the other [Dr John]; but one with whom I can talk on equal terms&quot;. Lucy disagrees with her and describes the count as “The doll—the puppet—the manikin—the poor inferior creature! A mere lackey for Dr. John his valet, his foot-boy!&quot;

Madame Modeste Maria Beck: The owner and headmistress of the boarding school for girls where Lucy is employed. She is short and stout, but not uncomely. Her complexion is described as fresh. &quot;She looked well, though a little bourgeois … .&quot; She has good sense and is an excellent administrator, though that is because she spies on everyone and goes through their possessions frequently. Lucy says, &quot;[S]he had no heart to be touched: it reminded her where she was impotent and dead.&quot; Lucy further describes her as &quot;wise, firm, faithless; secret, crafty, passionless; watchful and inscrutable; acute and insensate — withal perfectly decorous — what more could be desired?&quot; She seems attracted to Graham at first, but that dies away quickly. She then seeks to marry M. Paul Emanuel to keep him and his fortune under her thumb. She does all she can to keep Lucy and Paul apart, including conspiring with Père Silas.

Rosine: The pretty but unprincipled portress at Madame Beck&#x27;s boarding school. She is &quot;smart, trim, and pert&quot; and &quot;not a bad sort of person,&quot; according to Lucy. She likes to be bribed.

Père Silas: An elderly Catholic priest who makes it his mission, and later M. Emanuel&#x27;s, to convert Lucy. He is the mentor of Paul Emanuel, and uses the latter&#x27;s love of the late Justine Marie to manipulate him. He is instrumental in keeping M. Paul and Lucy apart.

Justine Marie: A deceased noviciate nun, the former love of Paul Emanuel. She had originally hoped to marry him, but her family&#x27;s objections led her to join a convent. During her time at Madame Beck&#x27;s, Lucy suspects she is being haunted by Justine&#x27;s ghost.

==Plot==
&quot;Villette&quot; begins with its protagonist and unreliable narrator, Lucy Snowe, aged 13, staying at the home of her godmother Mrs. Bretton in &quot;the clean and ancient town of Bretton&quot;, in England. Also in residence are Mrs. Bretton&#x27;s teenaged son, John Graham Bretton (whom the family calls Graham), and a young visitor, Paulina Home (who is called Polly), who is aged 6. Polly&#x27;s mother, who neglected her daughter, has recently died and her father is recommended by doctors to travel to improve his spirits. Polly is invited by Mrs. Bretton to stay. Polly is a serious little girl, who is described as unlike normal children. 

Polly soon develops a deep devotion to Graham, who showers her with attention. But Polly&#x27;s visit is cut short when her father arrives to summon her to live with him abroad.

For reasons that are not stated, Lucy leaves Mrs. Bretton&#x27;s home a few weeks after Polly&#x27;s departure. Some years pass, during which an unspecified family tragedy leaves Lucy without family, home, or means. After some initial hesitation, she is hired as a caregiver by Miss Marchmont, a rheumatic crippled woman. Lucy is soon accustomed to her work and has begun to feel content with her quiet, frugal lifestyle.

The night of a dramatic storm, Miss Marchmont regains all her energy and feels young again. She shares with Lucy her sad love story of 30 years ago, and concludes that she should treat Lucy better and be a better person. She believes that death will reunite her with her dead lover. The next morning, Lucy finds Miss Marchmont died in the night.

Lucy then leaves the English countryside and goes to London. At the age of 22, she boards a ship for Labassecour despite knowing very little French. On the ship, she meets Ginevra Fanshawe, who tells Lucy that the directress of her boarding school for girls (based upon the Hégers&#x27; Brussels &quot;pensionnat&quot;) she is attending, Madame Beck, needs a &quot;bonne&quot; for her children. She travels to the city of Villette in Labassecour where Madame Beck&#x27;s school is located. After a time, she is hired to teach English at the school, in addition to having to mind Madame Beck&#x27;s three children. She thrives despite Madame Beck&#x27;s constant spying on the staff and students.

&quot;Dr. John,&quot; a handsome English doctor, frequently visits the school at the behest of Madame Beck, and deepens his affection for the Ginevra Fanshawe. In one of &quot;Villette&quot;&#x27;s famous plot twists, &quot;Dr. John&quot; is later revealed to be John Graham Bretton, a fact that Lucy has known since he once asked her why she was staring at him, but has deliberately concealed from the reader. 

During the school holidays, all the teachers and pupils have either gone to travel abroad or gone back to their families. The school is completely empty except for a disabled child whom Lucy is supposed to take care of. After the disabled child is fetched away, Lucy is extremely lonely and becomes both mentally and physically ill. She goes to a Catholic church (despite being a Protestant) to confess to a priest. On the way back to the school, she collapses due to fever and mental exhaustion. Dr. John brings her to his home, which he shares with his mother, Mrs. Bretton. 

Graham recognises Lucy only after she is brought to Mrs. Bretton&#x27;s home. After Dr. John (i.e., Graham) discovers Ginevra&#x27;s true character while at the theatre, he turns his attention to Lucy, and they become close friends. She values this friendship highly despite her usual emotional reserve. Lucy soon develops feelings for Dr. John and treasures the letters he sends her once she returns to the &quot;pensionnat.&quot;

Lucy and Graham meet Polly (Paulina Home) again at the same theatre after a fire, in which Polly is injured. Polly&#x27;s father has inherited the title &quot;de Bassompierre&quot; and is now a Count; thus her name is now Paulina Mary Home de Bassompierre. Polly and Graham soon discover that they knew each other in the past and slowly renew their friendship. They fall in love and eventually marry despite the initial reluctance of Polly&#x27;s father. 

Lucy becomes progressively closer to a colleague, the irascible, autocratic, and confrontational &quot;professeur&quot;, M. Paul Emanuel, a relative of Mme. Beck. Lucy gradually realises that his apparent antagonism is actually helping her to overcome her weaknesses and to grow. She and Paul eventually fall in love.

However, a group of conspiring antagonists, including Madame Beck, the priest Père Silas, and the relatives of M. Paul&#x27;s long-dead fiancée, work to keep the two apart, on the grounds that a union between a Catholic and a Protestant is impossible. They finally succeed in forcing M. Paul&#x27;s departure for Guadeloupe to oversee a plantation there. He nonetheless declares his love for Lucy before his departure and arranges for her to live independently as the headmistress of her own day school, which she later expands into a &quot;pensionnat&quot;.

During the course of the novel, Lucy has three encounters with the figure of a nun — which may be the ghost of a nun who was buried alive on the school&#x27;s grounds as punishment for breaking her vow of chastity. In a highly symbolic scene near the end of the novel, she discovers the &quot;nun&#x27;s&quot; habit in her bed and destroys it. She later finds out that it was a disguise worn by Ginevra&#x27;s amour, Alfred de Hamal, placed in Lucy&#x27;s bed as a prank. The episodes with the nun no doubt contributed substantially to the novel&#x27;s reputation as a gothic novel. Ginevra keeps in contact with Lucy through letters that show the young coquette has not changed and expects to live off of her uncle&#x27;s (Basompierre&#x27;s) good graces.

&quot;Villette&quot;&#x27;s final pages are ambiguous. Although Lucy says that she wants to leave the reader free to imagine a happy ending, she hints strongly that M. Paul&#x27;s ship was destroyed by a storm during his return journey from the West Indies. She says that, &quot;M. Emanuel was away three years. Reader, they were the three happiest years of my life.&quot; This passage suggests that he was drowned by the &quot;destroying angel of tempest.&quot;

Brontë described the ambiguity of the ending as a &quot;little puzzle&quot; (quoted in Chapter XII of part 2 of Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;).

==Themes==
&quot;Villette&quot; is noted not so much for its plot as for its acute tracing of Lucy&#x27;s psychology. The novel, in a gothic setting, simultaneously explores themes of isolation, doubling, displacement and subversion, and each of their impacts upon the protagonist&#x27;s psyche.

&quot;Villette&quot; is sometimes celebrated as an exploration of gender roles and repression. In &quot;The Madwoman in the Attic&quot;, critics Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar have argued that the character of Lucy Snowe is based in part on William Wordsworth&#x27;s Lucy poems. Gilbert and Gubar emphasise the idea of feminine re-writing. Some critics have explored the issues of Lucy&#x27;s psychological state in terms of what they call &quot;patriarchal constructs&quot; which form her cultural context.

&quot;Villette&quot; also explores isolation and cross-cultural conflict in Lucy&#x27;s attempts to master the French language, as well as conflicts between her English Protestantism and Catholicism. Her denunciation of Catholicism is unsparing: e.g., &quot;God is not with Rome.&quot;

==Critical reception==
George Eliot believed &quot;Villette&quot; &quot;a still more wonderful book than &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. There is something almost preternatural in its power.&quot;

&quot;There are so few books, and so many volumes. Among the few stands &quot;Villette&quot;.&quot;—George Henry Lewes

Virginia Woolf claims that &quot;Villette&quot; is Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;finest novel,&quot; and highlights its evocative descriptions of the natural world as a reflection of the main character&#x27;s state of mind.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s Lucy Hughes-Hallett argues that &quot;Villette&quot; is greater than Brontë&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; She states that the novel is &quot;an astonishing piece of writing, a book in which phantasmagorical set pieces alternate with passages of minute psychological exploration, and in which Brontë’s marvellously flexible prose veers between sardonic wit and stream-of-consciousness, in which the syntax bends and flows and threatens to dissolve completely in the heat of madness, drug-induced hallucination and desperate desire.&quot;.

Claire Fallon of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; notes that &quot;Villette&quot; shares many themes with Brontë&#x27;s previous works such as &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; yet highlights the dichotomy between the two novels&#x27; protagonists. &quot;V&quot;illette&quot; bears a certain Brontëan resemblance to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; – gothic mysticism, spiritual intensity, bursts of passionate lyricism, a plain heroine making her way in an unfriendly world – but is in many other ways its inverse. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; works in sharp black and white, while &quot;Villette&quot; works in psychological and even factual grey areas. Where Jane’s specialness is stipulated, despite her poverty and plain looks, the heroine of Villette, Lucy Snowe, is an unassuming figure who spends the majority of the novel as a quiet observer. Jane insists on her own agency, while Lucy is reactive at best. Yet it is Lucy who truly breaks free of the expected domestic fate.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===In print===
Jamaica Kincaid&#x27;s novel &quot;Lucy&quot; (1990) draws numerous themes, character names, and plot elements from &quot;Villette&quot;, both echoing its concern of female repression while also offering an implicit postcolonial critique of the novel&#x27;s slave-owning love interest.

===In dramatisations===
In 1970, the BBC produced a television miniseries based on &quot;Villette&quot;, directed by Moira Armstrong and written by Lennox Phillips. It starred Judy Parfitt as Lucy Snowe, Bryan Marshall as Dr. John Graham Bretton, Peter Jeffrey as Paul Emanuel, and Mona Bruce as Madame Beck.

In 1999, the novel was adapted as a three-hour radio serial for BBC Radio 4. It was broadcast in February 1999 with Catherine McCormack as Lucy Snowe, Joseph Fiennes as Dr. Graham Bretton, Harriet Walter as Mme. Beck, James Laurenson as M. Paul Emanuel, and Keira Knightley as Polly. It was directed by Catherine Bailey and written by James Friel. &quot;Villette&quot; went on to win a Sony Award.

In August 2009, the novel was adapted as a two-week-long serial by Rachel Joyce for BBC Radio 4, directed by Tracey Neale and with Anna Maxwell Martin as Lucy Snowe.

It was from the harbour of Dives-sur-Mer that William the Conqueror set out on the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. On the night before sailing to Pevensey Bay for battle, William and 475 barons and knights from Normandy, Flanders, and Brittany attended Dives-sur-Mer Church for Mass and prayers. After much research in the 18th century, the French government placed a monumental plaque in the church listing by name all 475 companions of the Conqueror on that great mission Book One of &quot;One Family&#x27;s Journey Through Ten Centuries, by William Lilly contains analysis at Appendix d, p. 1395 of the efforts to determine who those knights were. The medieval wooden market hall and the 13th-14th-century church are the main attractions of the town.

<text>Deltron 3030 is an American hip hop trio composed of producer Dan the Automator (as the Cantankerous Captain Aptos), rapper Del the Funky Homosapien (as Deltron Zero/Deltron Osiris), and DJ Kid Koala (as Skiznod the Boy Wonder). They also collaborate with a variety of other musicians under many futuristic pseudonyms.

==History==

===&quot;Deltron 3030&quot;===

The group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Deltron 3030&quot;, released on May 23, 2000, is a concept album set in the year 3030 that tells of the dualistic conflict of fatalism that takes place between the moral concepts of &quot;righteousness&quot; and &quot;malevolence.&quot; The story tells a prophetic tale of a warrior&#x27;s thirst for battle as Del&#x27;s alter ego, who goes by the name &quot;Deltron-Zero,&quot; along with his comrade who happens to be a time-traveling cyborg wizard named &quot;the Automator,&quot; face-off against megalithic corporations that megalomaniacally rule over our thermodynamic universe. The lyrics were written in less than two weeks and are characterized by extravagant allusions to futuristic outer-space themes in the tradition of Afrofuturist works by Sun Ra and George Clinton. Many samples originated with the contemporary French classical composer William Sheller.

===&quot;Event 2&quot;===

Deltron 3030&#x27;s second album, titled &quot;Event 2&quot;, was released in September 2013.

Production began as far back as 2004, and in November 2006 Del told IGN that four songs were already written and that &quot;the album&#x27;s lyrical theme has been basically mapped out.&quot; Dan the Automator stated that the recording of the new album would probably be completed by December 2006, and that it would be released in 2007. Due to a series of delays, group members issued a number of statements predicting imminent completion in 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012.

On June 11, 2012, Deltron 3030 performed at the Luminato festival in Toronto, Ontario, a show that Kid Koala dubbed the Deltron Event 2 World Premiere. The group played with a full horn, strings, and rhythm section conducted by Dan the Automator, premiered ten songs from &quot;Event 2&quot;, and revealed the visual style of the new album. In accordance with Del&#x27;s statement that &quot;3030 actually was one event, but these events can span centuries.&quot; The first single from the album was &quot;City Rising From the Ashes,&quot; a song influenced by the story of Osiris. On September 23, 2013, &quot;Event 2&quot; was put on Pitchfork&#x27;s Advance Streaming service in its entirety, one week before its official release.

In October 2016, an expanded edition of &quot;Event 2&quot; was released, featuring instrumentals from the album. Alongside this new addition, a live album featuring Deltron 3030, many of their collaborators from the &quot;Event 2&quot; album, and the 3030 Orchestra, simply entitled &quot;Live&quot;, was released.

=== Upcoming third album ===
On an episode of Red Bull Radio &quot;Peak Time&quot; in 2018, Dan The Automator confirmed he was working on a new Deltron 3030 album, stating &quot;there&#x27;s a couple songs that exist.&quot; He also hinted that Dr. Octagon would have a cameo on the album.

<doc id="582296" wikidata="Q3977956" url="?curid=582296" title="Superman for All Seasons">
<text>Superman for All Seasons is a 4-issue comic book limited series written by Jeph Loeb with art by Tim Sale. It was originally published by DC Comics in 1998, after their previous success, &quot;&quot;. After that story&#x27;s theme was holidays, this one&#x27;s theme dealt with seasons. The artwork contains many influences from that of Norman Rockwell. The story also parallels the events from Superman&#x27;s then-origin story John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, though it can be read on its own.

==Publication history==
&quot;Superman For All Seasons&quot; was conceived, like all of the Jeph Loeb/Tim Sale books from DC Comics and rival Marvel Comics, as a stand-alone, self-contained story that gave a sense of the character of Superman and his supporting cast. The title is not an origin story, but it picks up on who the character is and how he came to be.

As explained by Loeb, one of the things that he wanted to capture was the grandeur that is Superman, and that was to have double-page spreads with big sky shots. Sale and Bjarne Hansen were on the art and colors, and everyone was speechless once Loeb saw the pages, and when those same pages came in the DC office. One of the most powerful examples of this artistic choice is near the end of the first issue, featuring a double-page spread of Clark Kent and Pa Kent looking out at a radiant Kansas sunset from their farm as Clark prepares to leave home for Metropolis.

The key element to the series was the narration. Originally, Loeb never intended to have a narrator, but he did not want to do the story from Superman&#x27;s point of view. He explained that he didn&#x27;t feel comfortable being inside the head of an icon. It was decided to allow other characters to narrate and give their individual points of view on Superman, with one narrator per volume. Pa Kent gives his life as a father to a super-powered son. While not knowing what lay ahead of Clark, he has confidence that his son would be all right. This, in turn, came from Loeb himself as the father to his son, Sam Loeb. Narration by Lois Lane represents the impact of Superman&#x27;s presence in Metropolis and comments on Superman as an idea. Lex Luthor explains how his rivalry with Superman is like a love story between him and Metropolis, and Lana Lang helps Clark reconcile his two identities as mild-mannered reporter and Superman.

==Plot synopsis==
===Spring===
Narrated by Jonathan Kent, he thinks back on his son Clark&#x27;s roots as a farm boy in Smallville, Kansas. At the end of Clark&#x27;s last year in high school, Jonathan tells him that he and his wife Martha found him in an alien rocket when he was an infant, raising him as their son, and that he can do things &quot;other boys can&#x27;t&quot;. Clark overhears his parents discuss their uncertainty about his future, and struggles with his growing powers. When a tornado strikes the town, Clark discovers he can fly and rescues a neighbor, but wonders if he could have done more. After graduation, Clark reveals his powers and his desire to use them to help people to his best friend Lana Lang, who urges him to leave Smallville. Clark says goodbye to his parents and leaves for Metropolis, becoming a reporter at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; with a crush on rival Lois Lane, and donning a costume his mother made him to do some good.

===Summer===
Narrated by Lois Lane, she muses that her rules as a journalist have been disrupted by the arrival of the costumed hero she dubs &quot;Superman&quot;, unaware he is her colleague Clark. Superman saves the city from a nuclear missile and rescues Lois from the rogue submarine responsible, delivering the terrorists to the authorities and confronting billionaire Lex Luthor for his involvement. Lois finds herself intrigued by Superman. Clark returns to Smallville to visit his parents and friend Pete Ross, and learns Lana has left to travel the world; he feels out of place in the city and sad that his home has changed, but Martha assures him he will find his way. Back in Metropolis, Luthor&#x27;s exosuit-powered &quot;Guardians of the City&quot; respond to a fire at Chemco Labs. Superman arrives and saves a scientist, Jenny Vaughn, trapped inside, before single-handedly dousing the fire. Luthor later meets with Vaughn, who has become obsessed with Superman, for his own plans.

===Fall===
Narrated by Lex Luthor, he considers his control of Metropolis &quot;a love story… between a man and a city&quot;. After spending a night in jail, Luthor plans revenge on Superman; he brainwashes Vaughn with images of Superman, declaring her biochemical expertise will prove useful. At the Daily Planet, Clark watches helplessly as Lois and everyone in the building falls unconscious. As Superman, he races through Metropolis to find the entire city afflicted, and stops a runaway train. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Professor Crosby informs Superman the city has been struck by a mysterious airborne virus. He confronts Luthor, quarantined in his skyscraper, and is forced to ask for his help. Luthor presents Vaughn, transformed into &quot;Toxin&quot;; she and Superman seed the clouds above Metropolis with chemicals and the antidote rains down, curing the city, but Toxin succumbs from overexposure to the virus and dies in Superman&#x27;s arms when they return to LexCorp. Luthor convinces Superman that he is not enough to save everyone, and Clark returns to Smallville.

===Winter===
Narrated by Lana Lang, she reveals that she was in love with Clark, but the revelation of his powers and his departure to help the world ended her dreams of a life with him. In Metropolis, Luthor regains his power over the city, and Lois ponders the disappearance of Superman and Clark&#x27;s absence. In Smallville, Clark reunites with Lana and Pete, who chastises them for having ended up back home. Lana has dinner with the Kents when news comes of a flood. With Lana&#x27;s blessing, Clark sets out as Superman to rescue the town, damming the flood. Lana and the Kents are swept away, but Superman arrives in the nick of time. He returns to Metropolis, infuriating Lois with a front-page story and Luthor with Superman&#x27;s reappearance, as Lana finds peace with a new life in Smallville.

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into an individual volume:
* &quot;Superman for All Seasons&quot; (206 pages, hardcover, , softcover, )

==Reception==
&quot;Superman For All Seasons&quot; was highly praised by fans and critics. Readers found that it was the themes and messages from the writing and art that really hit home. Some examples include its use of metaphor to illustrate the coming of age, the end of childhood and the acceptance of your place in the world. It was voted the third best foreign comic book published in Japan in the Gaiman Award.

==Continuations==
The Clark Kent/Superman from &quot;For All Seasons&quot; has reappeared three times since the series ended, all in other Loeb/Sale stories. First, in a short story from &quot;Superman/Batman: Secret Files &amp; Origins 2003&quot; (Nov. 2003) titled &quot;When Clark Met Bruce&quot;, depicting the first meeting of Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent as young boys in Smallville. &quot;Solo&quot; #1 (Dec. 2004) featured &quot;Prom Night&quot; which depicted Clark picking up Lana Lang as his prom date. Finally, a short story in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #26 (June 2006) titled &quot;Sam&#x27;s Story&quot;, Superman recounts his friend from high school who died of cancer when he was very young. The &quot;Sam&quot; character is based on Jeph Loeb&#x27;s son, Sam, who died from the same illness. Those stories were included in the 2023 hardcover and paperback editions published after Tim Sale&#x27;s passing.

==In other media==
* The mini-series was the inspiration for the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. Jeph Loeb served as a writer and executive producer on the show. 
* The mini-series serves as an inspiration for the upcoming DC Universe (DCU) film &quot;Superman&quot;.

<text>Douvres-la-Délivrande () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. The name was simply Douvres until 1961, when it was expanded to refer to the basilica Notre-Dame de la Délivrande (&quot;Our Lady of Deliverance&quot;), located in the town, a site of pilgrimage.

==History==

===World War II===
During the Second World War, Douvres-la-Délivrande was the site of an important German air-detection radar installation, part of the strategic Atlantic Wall defences. Completed in the autumn of 1943, the station was split into two zones by the road from Douvres to Bény-sur-Mer; and heavily fortified with bunkers, machineguns and minefields.

The Northern zone held a large Siemens &#x27;Wasserman&#x27; long-range radar and associated structures. The larger Southern zone had two intermediate-range Freya and two short-range Würzburg Riese radars; as well as command and infirmary bunkers, garages and artillery placements. Some 230 Luftwaffe personnel were based at the station, including electricians, engineers and 36 air controllers.

At 11 pm on the night of 5/6 June 1944, the Allies launched intensive jamming of radar frequencies which blinded the entire German radar network from Cherbourg to Le Havre. On the morning of the 6th (D-Day) the antennas at Douvres-la-Délivrande were rendered inoperative by Allied naval artillery bombardment.

Canadian troops who had landed nearby on &#x27;Juno Beach&#x27; isolated the station but the Germans successfully defended it for 12 days, awaiting a counter-attack by Panzers; on one occasion it was resupplied with food via a nocturnal paradrop mission from Mont-de-Marsan.
On 17 June, a massive offensive by the British 41 Commando, Royal Marines - preceded by an artillery bombardment and supported by mine-clearing and anti-bunker tanks of 79th Armoured Division - secured the surrender of the garrison.

===Present day===
The radar site at Douvres-la-Délivrande is now home to a museum, with two of the bunkers housing displays about the evolution and role of radar. The museum also maintains a rare preserved example of the &#x27;Würzburg&#x27; radar antenna.

The commune has a war cemetery with the graves of 1123 soldiers from both the Allied and Axis forces:
*927 British
*180 Germans
*11 Canadians
*3 Australians
*1 Pole
*1 unknown soldier

<text>Dozulé () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northern France.

==Population==
== The apparitions and the Glorious Cross ==

Between 1972 and 1978, Jesus Christ is said to have appeared 49 times in Dozulé to Madeleine Aumont, a mother of five children, in the presence of her parish priest Victor L&#x27;Horset and other faithful people. He is believed to have dictated a series of messages, containing teachings and warnings for all people, according to those who believed in them. Among them is the daily &quot;Prayer of Dozulé&quot;. The messages are seen as an annunciation of the return of Christ. There is also the Glorious Cross, an illuminated Catholic cross coloured white and blue, tall with arms long. The exact ratio of 3 between the vertical and horizontal lengths is based on the reported visions.

The followers of the messages of Dozulé believe also that they are the continuation of the Three Secrets of Fátima and that they ask, for the conversion of humanity to avoid a material and spiritual catastrophe.

== International relations ==
Dozulé is twinned with Leonard Stanley, a village in Gloucestershire, in the United Kingdom.

<text>Bulmers cider is one of a number of brands owned by British cider maker H. P. Bulmer of Hereford, a Heineken subsidiary. It is one of the biggest selling British bottled cider brands in the UK with a number of variants including Bulmers Original &amp; Pear. It should not be confused with Bulmers Irish Cider, sold outside the Republic of Ireland as Magners.

==History==
Fred and Percy Bulmer grew the apples at their family orchard at Credenhill in Herefordshire which would be later used to make the cider for which they became known. Production was initially at Ryelands Street in Hereford, the original buildings, including cider cellars survives today as the Cider Museum and King Offa Distillery. Production moved to the current Plough Lane site in the late 1970s. Today HP Bulmer makes 65% of the UK&#x27;s five hundred million litres of cider sold annually, and the bulk of the UK&#x27;s cider exports. From 1937 to 1949, Bulmers operated with Wm. Magners of Clonmel, expanding into Irish distribution markets. From 1949 Magners withdrew from this partnership but retained rights to trade under the name HP Bulmer Ltd in Ireland.

In 2003, the Hereford-based firm was bought for £278 million by Scottish &amp; Newcastle (S&amp;N) with the loss of some 200 jobs initially. In 2008, S&amp;N were bought for £7.8 billion by the Carlsberg and Heineken groups. Bulmers now only survives as a brand name and subsidiary of the Dutch Heineken group, with operations in Hereford scaled back to focus mainly on the production of cider.

During spring 2006, the company relaunched Bulmers Original in the UK, aimed at the &quot;served over ice&quot; market, which had grown in popularity over the past few years. Bulmers Original is a 4.5% ABV cider, primarily sold in pint bottles (568 ml). In November 2007, Bulmers pear cider was launched.

In summer 2011, Bulmers relaunched with a new look and new bottles. In reference to the Bulmers naming tradition dating back to the early 1900s (at the time these were Bulmers 1 through to 8), they number-coded the then-current and all future varieties with Original as &quot;No. 9&quot;, Pear as &quot;No. 10&quot; and Crisp Blend as &quot;No. 15&quot;. At the same time, the Red Berry and Lime flavour was launched as &quot;No. 17&quot;.

In March 2013, two new flavours; &quot;Bulmers Cider Bold Black Cherry&quot; and &quot;Bulmers Cider Pressed Red Grape&quot;, number-coded &quot;No. 19&quot; and &quot;No. 20&quot; respectively, were added to the range. In March 2014, two lower-alcohol flavours were added: Bulmers Cider Five Fruit Harvest and Bulmers Cider Indian Summer, number-coded &quot;No. 21&quot; and &quot;No. 22&quot; and with an ABV of 2.8%.

In 2015, the red grape flavour was discontinued and replaced with a new flavour &quot;Zesty Blood Orange&quot;, number-coded as &quot;No. 23&quot;. The black cherry flavour was discontinued the following year and replaced with &quot;Wild Blueberry and Lime&quot;, number-coded as &quot;No. 24&quot;.

In 2016, Bulmers rebranded yet again, now with bottles of smaller volume at 500 ml

2017 introduced the &quot;Orchard Pioneers&quot; range, &#x27;artisanal&#x27; ciders created by the company&#x27;s suppliers; the range opened with &quot;Kier&#x27;s Cloudy Apple Cider&quot; (Kier Rogers) and &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Red Apple Cider&quot; (Sarah Hawkins), number-coded as &quot;No. 25&quot; and &quot;No. 26&quot; respectively.

As of 2021, only the Original and Red Berry &amp; Lime flavours remain available.

==Ingredients==
In 2014, a study by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found that a pint of Bulmers cider contained five teaspoons (20.5g) of sugar, nearly as much as the WHO recommends as an adult&#x27;s daily allowance of added sugar, and 5-10 times the sugar of lager or ale.

By law, all cider produced in the UK must contain a minimum of 35% apple juice, but this can be imported concentrate. Bulmers do not disclose the percentage of apple juice in their product.

==Current range==
There are currently only two flavours.

*Bulmers Original Cider
*Bulmers Crushed Red Berries and Lime Cider
*Orchard Pioneers: Kier&#x27;s Cloudy Apple Cider
*Orchard Pioneers: Sarah&#x27;s Red Apple Cider

==Limited edition variants==
Bulmers have produced several limited edition flavours:

Bulmers Light, introduced in Spring 2008, had the same ABV as Bulmers Original but with 30% fewer calories. However this was delisted a year later due to poor sales.

In Summer 2010, a limited edition version was made, combining both apple and pear flavours in one and named &#x27;Summer Blend&#x27;. In Autumn 2010, another limited edition version was created, made using Katy apples which are allowed to fully ripen in the orchards before harvesting, and named &quot;Red Apple&quot;.

In the Summer 2011, Bulmers released the limited edition &quot;Crisp Blend&quot; which is made from sharper tasting apples, with a crisp and slightly drier flavour than Original. It was available in pint bottles only. To celebrate the 125th anniversary of the brand in 2012, Bulmers released Bulmers Vintage Reserve (&quot;No. 18&quot;), made with 100% bittersweet apples from the previous year&#x27;s crop.

<doc id="582311" wikidata="Q371467" url="?curid=582311" title="Scopus">
<text>Scopus is a scientific abstract and citation database, launched by the academic publisher Elsevier as a competitor to older Web of Science in 2004. The ensuing competition between the two databases has been characterized as &quot;intense&quot; and is considered to significantly benefit their users in terms of continuous improvement in coverage, search/analysis capabilities, but not in price. Free database The Lens completes the triad of main universal academic research databases.

Journals in Scopus are reviewed for sufficient quality each year according to four numerical measures: &quot;h&quot;-Index, CiteScore, SJR (SCImago Journal Rank) and SNIP (source normalized impact per paper). For this reason, the journals listed in Scopus are considered to meet the requirement for peer review quality established by several research grant agencies for their grant recipients and by degree-accreditation boards in a number of countries.

Scopus also allows patent searches from a dedicated patent database, Lexis-Nexis, albeit with limited functionality. At present, Scopus indexes the following patent databases: United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO); European Patent Office (EPO); Japan Patent Office (JPO): World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO); UK Intellectual Property Office.

==Overview==
Comparing ease of use and coverage of Scopus and the Web of Science (WOS), a 2006 study concluded that Scopus is &quot;easy to navigate, even for the novice user. ... The ability to search both forward and backward from a particular citation would be very helpful to the researcher. The multidisciplinary aspect allows the researcher to easily search outside of his discipline&quot; and &quot;One advantage of WOS over Scopus is the depth of coverage, with the full WOS database going back to 1945 and Scopus going back to 1966. However, Scopus and WOS complement each other as neither resource is all-inclusive.&quot; A small number of studies found ca. 80-90% overlap in coverage between WoS and Scopus for the period between 1990 and 2020.

In terms of the structured query language search capabilities Scopus is somewhat more advanced than Web of Science: for example, WoS can perform only NEAR/n queries, Scopus can also do PRE/n queries.

Also, when the same article was covered in Scopus and in the Web of Science (WoS), its Scopus entry had a keyword ratio 3-5 of than its WoS counterpart, and the Scopus keywords are more focused on the specific article content, whereas WoS has more keywords related to the broad category of the article&#x27;s subject. A larger number of narrow-targeted keywords allows Scopus users to find a larger number of relevant publications, while filtering out false positives. On the other hand, WoS exports (e.g. in the ris format) the doi numbers of cited articles, while Scopus exports the titles of cited articles. Also, Scopus allows exporting 20,000 references (e.g. as a ris file) at once, while WoS export is limited to 5,000 references at once. 

Scopus provides chemical search by CAS number and by chemical name, while WoS does not have these features. On the other hand, WoS has chemical structure search, but only a small number of publications are actually indexed for chemical structure searches. SciFinder is the preferred option for chemical searches is all cases.

Scopus also offers author profiles which cover affiliations, number of publications and their bibliographic data, references, and details on the number of citations each published document has received. It has alerting features that allow registered users to track changes to a profile and a facility to calculate authors&#x27; &quot;h&quot;-index. In 2016, a gratis website, Scopus CiteScore, was introduced. It provides citation data for all 25,000+ active titles such as journals, conference proceedings and books in Scopus and provides an alternative to the impact factor, a journal-level indicator which may correlate negatively with reliability.

Scopus IDs for individual authors can be integrated with the non-proprietary digital identifier ORCID.

In 2018, Scopus started embedding partial information about the open access status of works, using Unpaywall data. However, Scopus&#x27; ris export files do not contain the information about Open Access status.

== Content selection and advisory board ==
Since Elsevier is the owner of Scopus and is also one of the main international publishers of scientific journals, an independent and international Scopus Content Selection and advisory board (CSAB) was established in 2009 to prevent a potential conflict of interest in the choice of journals to be included in the database and to maintain an open and transparent content coverage policy, regardless of publisher. The board consists of scientists and subject librarians. Nevertheless, critique over a perceived conflict of interest has continued.

CSAB team is responsible for inclusion and exclusion of different titles on Scopus. The list of journals and books indexed in Scopus is updated 2 to 3 times per year. Each year Scopus receives around 3,500 submissions for new titles to be included and accepts approximately 25% of them. The re-evaluation policy is based on four criteria of Publication Concern, Under Performance, Outlier Performance and Continuous curation. Between 2004 and 2020, Scopus included 46,534 and excluded 688 titles Between 2016 and 2023, the CSAB has re-evaluated 990 titles published by 539 different publishers, leading to 536 titles discontinued for indexing. 
In 2024 Scopus covered around 28,000 active journals and nearly 300,000 books. 

Nevertheless, research continues to show the inclusion of predatory journals. 

While marketed as a global point of reference, Scopus and WoS have been characterised as &quot;structurally biased against research produced in non-Western countries, non-English language research, and research from the arts, humanities, and social sciences&quot;.

== Scopus AI ==
Scopus AI, launched by Elsevier in January 2024, is a generative AI tool designed to revolutionize research by leveraging the world&#x27;s largest database of curated scientific literature. This functionality aims to assist researchers and institutions in obtaining fast, accurate summaries and insights to enhance research collaboration and societal impact.

According to Maxim Khan, then the VP of Analytics, Products and Data Platform at Elsevier, Scopus AI provides the following benefits:

* Expanded summaries
* Foundational and Influential paper identification
* Academic Expert Search which is a form of search dedicated to identifying experts in specific fields.

== Derived citation metrics ==
=== CiteScore ===
=== SCImago Journal Rank ===
== Controversies ==
An article published by &quot;Scholarly Criticism&quot; in 2024 alleges that Elsevier unethically indexed the journal Heliyon, which is published by Elsevier&#x27;s subsiduary, in Scopus within a few months of its launch. This indexing occurred with one citation and four published issues in 2015, which the article suggests does not align with the rules prescribed for other journals. The article further alleges that Elsevier was motivated to engage in this practice, which the article calls a &quot;conflict of interest,&quot; in order to attract authors to publish in Heliyon, which charges an article processing charge of USD 2,100 per publication.

In 2024 French National Centre for Scientific Research CNRS ended its subscription to Scopus, while maintaining for the that year its subscription to Web of Science. This decision was allegedly motivated by a greater use of Web of Science by CNRS&#x27;s employees.

<doc id="582329" wikidata="Q1849222" url="?curid=582329" title="OpenMPT">
<text>OpenMPT is an open-source audio module tracker for Windows (with an intended Wine-functionality for UNIX and Linux x86-systems). It was previously called ModPlug Tracker, and was first released by Olivier Lapicque in September 1997.

&quot;Computer Music&quot; magazine listed OpenMPT among the top five free music trackers in 2007, and it is one of the most widely used trackers.

==History==

=== MOD Plugin and ModPlug Tracker ===

OpenMPT was initially developed as a browser plug-in called MOD Plugin, which enabled users to play music and other sounds encoded in module files. ModPlug Tracker, along with a player application named ModPlug Player, evolved from this plug-in.

In December 1999, Olivier Lapicque sent the module-playing parts of ModPlug Tracker&#x27;s source code to Kenton Varda, under the GPL-2.0-or-later, to write a plugin for XMMS based on the code. In 2001, the source code was released in the public domain, and the mod-playing code was split off into a separate library, &quot;libmodplug&quot;, maintained as part of the ModPlug XMMS Plugin project. This project lay dormant from late 2003 until early 2006, when it was picked up again. Today, &quot;libmodplug&quot; is included in many Linux distributions as a default audio plugin for playing module files and is a part of the popular open source multimedia framework gstreamer.

Due to lack of time, Olivier Lapicque discontinued development of ModPlug Tracker itself, and in January 2004, he released the entire source code under an open-source license. The ModPlug Player source code is still closed as of May 2020.

=== OpenMPT ===
Lapicque&#x27;s MPT code was taken up by a group of tracker musicians/programmers and is now known as OpenMPT. Also based on the ModPlug code is OpenMPT&#x27;s &quot;sister project&quot; &quot;Schism Tracker&quot; which contributed several backports of bugfixes to OpenMPT.

OpenMPT is distributed as free software and is, as of August 2022, under active development. Until May 2009 (v1.17.02.53) OpenMPT was licensed under the Copyleft GPL-2.0-or-later and then relicensed under the terms of the permissive BSD-3-Clause. Since OpenMPT 1.23 (March 2014), OpenMPT is also available as a 64-bit application. This allows musicians to use 64-bit VST plugins and make use of the entire physical memory on 64-bit systems. For this purpose, OpenMPT provides its own plugin bridge, which can be used to run plugins with a different bitness than the host in a separate process, or to run plugin in a sandbox and prevent them from crashing the host application.

== Features ==
OpenMPT&#x27;s main distinguishing feature is its native Windows user interface. Most trackers, even newer ones such as Renoise, have interfaces modelled after the older DOS trackers such as FastTracker II. It supports samples, VST plugins and OPL3 instruments as sound sources.
OpenMPT makes use of features common to Microsoft Windows programs, such as context menus for effect selection, &quot;tree&quot; views (for files, samples, and patterns), drag and drop functionality throughout, and the native look and feel of the Windows platform.

It supports both loading and saving of IT (Impulse Tracker), XM (FastTracker Extended Module), MOD (Protracker and similar), S3M (Scream Tracker 3) and MPTM (its own file format) files, imports many more module and sample file formats, and has some support for DLS banks and SoundFonts.

OpenMPT was also one of the first trackers to support opening and editing of multiple tracker modules in parallel. OpenMPT supports up to 127 tracks/channels, VST Plugins, VST instruments and has ASIO support.

===MPTM file format===

Due to limitations of the various mod file formats it is able to save, a new module format called MPTM was created in 2007.

OpenMPT introduced some non-standard additions to the older file formats. For example, one can use stereo samples or add VST plugins to XM and IT modules, which were not supported in the original trackers. Many of these features have gradually been removed from IT and XM files and made available only in MPTM files.

===libopenmpt===

libopenmpt is a cross-platform module playing library based on the OpenMPT code with interfaces for C, C++ and other programming languages. To ensure that the code bases do not diverge like in the case of ModPlug Tracker and libmodplug, libopenmpt development takes place in the same code repository as OpenMPT. Official input plug-ins for popular audio players (XMPlay, Winamp and foobar2000) based on libopenmpt are also available from the website. FFmpeg also offers an optional module decoder based on libopenmpt. libopenmpt can also serve as a drop-in replacement for libmodplug and thus offer up-to-date module playback capabilities for software that relies on the libmodplug API.

==Reception and users==

Nicolay of the Grammy-nominated The Foreign Exchange has revealed that ModPlug is his &quot;Secret Weapon&quot;. Movie and video game music composer Raphaël Gesqua made known his use of OpenMPT in an interview.

Peter Hajba and Alexander Brandon used OpenMPT to compose the soundtracks for &quot;Bejeweled 2&quot;, &quot;Bejeweled 3&quot; and other PopCap games.

Electronic rock musician Blue Stahli has mentioned that he used ModPlug Tracker and other trackers in the past.

==Geography==
Escoville is located 5 kilometers north of Troarn, 11 kilometers northeast of Caen, 14 kilometers south of Cabourg, and 35 kilometers from Deauville. Escoville is part of the urban area of Caen.

==Toponymy==
The name of the locality is attested in the form &quot;Scotvilla&quot; in 1101 (note AG according to the Red Cartulary of Troarn) ; &quot;Escoldivilla&quot; in 1109 (Dictionnaire topographique, according to the cartulary of Troarn) ; &quot;Scolvilla&quot; in 1156 - 1161 (act H 2, 169); &quot;Escotvilla&quot; in 1201 (AC,H 941) ; &quot;Ecovilla&quot; in 1128 (charter of Sainte-Barbe) ; &quot;Escovilla&quot; in 1208 (Charter of the abbey of Aunay).

Albert Dauzat and, following him, Ernest Nègre consider that the first element &quot;Escold-&quot; represents the Germanic personal name &quot;Ascald(us)&quot;, variant form &quot;Ascolt&quot;, while there is no ancient form in &quot;As-&quot;. Furthermore, they did not know the first form &quot;Scotvilla&quot;, which is entirely compatible with the evolutions &quot;Escotvilla&quot; &gt; &quot;Ecovilla&quot; (type &quot;scola&quot; &gt; &quot;escole&quot; &gt; &quot;école&quot;), but not really with &quot;*Ascaldvilla&quot; &gt; &quot;Escoldivilla&quot; or &quot;*Ascoltvilla&quot; &gt; &quot;Escoldivilla&quot;, we should end up in &quot;*Escauville&quot; in one case and &quot;*Escouville&quot; in the other. This is why François de Beaurepaire identifies the ethnic &quot;scot&quot; as &quot;Scottish&quot; (&quot;Scot&quot; as &quot;the Scotsman&quot; cf. surname &quot;Lescot&quot;, modern French &quot;l&#x27;Écossais&quot;).

Homonymy with Escoville (Seine-Maritime, Saint-Laurent-de-Brèvedent, &quot;Escoville par. de Saint-Laurent d’Esquetot&quot;, 1558). The name &quot;(E)scoville&quot; has evolved into the English last names &quot;Scoville&quot; (Anglo-Norman form), &quot;Scovill, Scoffield, Schofield, and Scourfield&quot;.

<doc id="582340" wikidata="Q1151850" url="?curid=582340" title="Quadratic sieve">
<text>The quadratic sieve algorithm (QS) is an integer factorization algorithm and, in practice, the second-fastest method known (after the general number field sieve). It is still the fastest for integers under 100 decimal digits or so, and is considerably simpler than the number field sieve. It is a general-purpose factorization algorithm, meaning that its running time depends solely on the size of the integer to be factored, and not on special structure or properties. It was invented by Carl Pomerance in 1981 as an improvement to Schroeppel&#x27;s linear sieve.

==Basic aim==
The algorithm attempts to set up a congruence of squares modulo &quot;n&quot; (the integer to be factorized), which often leads to a factorization of &quot;n&quot;. The algorithm works in two phases: the &quot;data collection&quot; phase, where it collects information that may lead to a congruence of squares; and the &quot;data processing&quot; phase, where it puts all the data it has collected into a matrix and solves it to obtain a congruence of squares. The data collection phase can be easily parallelized to many processors, but the data processing phase requires large amounts of memory, and is difficult to parallelize efficiently over many nodes or if the processing nodes do not each have enough memory to store the whole matrix. The block Wiedemann algorithm can be used in the case of a few systems each capable of holding the matrix.

The naive approach to finding a congruence of squares is to pick a random number, square it, divide by &quot;n&quot; and hope the least non-negative remainder is a perfect square. For example, formula_1. This approach finds a congruence of squares only rarely for large &quot;n&quot;, but when it does find one, more often than not, the congruence is nontrivial and the factorization is complete. This is roughly the basis of Fermat&#x27;s factorization method.

The quadratic sieve is a modification of Dixon&#x27;s factorization method. The general running time required for the quadratic sieve (to factor an integer &quot;n&quot;) is conjectured to be
:formula_2
in the L-notation. The constant &quot;e&quot; is the base of the natural logarithm.

== The approach ==

To factorize the integer &quot;n&quot;, Fermat&#x27;s method entails a search for a single number &quot;a&quot;, , such that the remainder of &quot;a&quot;2 divided by &quot;n&quot; is a square. But these &quot;a&quot; are hard to find. The quadratic sieve consists of computing the remainder of &quot;a&quot;2/&quot;n&quot; for several &quot;a&quot;, then finding a subset of these whose product is a square. This will yield a congruence of squares.

For example, consider attempting to factor the number 1649. We have: formula_3. None of the integers formula_4 is a square, but the product formula_5 is a square. We also had 
:formula_6
since formula_7.
The observation that formula_5 thus gives a congruence of squares 
:formula_9 
Hence formula_10 for some integer formula_11. We can then factor 
:formula_12
using the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor.

So the problem has now been reduced to: given a set of integers, find a subset whose product is a square. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, any positive integer can be written uniquely as a product of prime powers. We do this in a vector format; for example, the prime-power factorization of 504 is 23325071, it is therefore represented by the exponent vector (3,2,0,1). Multiplying two integers then corresponds to adding their exponent vectors. A number is a square when its exponent vector is even in every coordinate. For example, the vectors (3,2,0,1) + (1,0,0,1) = (4,2,0,2), so (504)(14) is a square. Searching for a square requires knowledge only of the parity of the numbers in the vectors, so it is sufficient to compute these vectors mod 2: (1,0,0,1) + (1,0,0,1) = (0,0,0,0).
So given a set of (0,1)-vectors, we need to find a subset which adds to the zero vector mod 2. 

This is a linear algebra problem since the ring formula_13 can be regarded as the Galois field of order 2, that is we can divide by all non-zero numbers (there is only one, namely 1) when calculating modulo 2.
It is a theorem of linear algebra that with more vectors than each vector has entries, a linear dependency always exists. It can be found by Gaussian elimination.
However, simply squaring many random numbers mod &quot;n&quot; produces a very large number of different prime factors, and thus very long vectors and a very large matrix. The trick is to look specifically for numbers &quot;a&quot; such that &quot;a&quot;2 mod &quot;n&quot; has only small prime factors (they are smooth numbers). They are harder to find, but using only smooth numbers keeps the vectors and matrices smaller and more tractable. The quadratic sieve searches for smooth numbers using a technique called sieving, discussed later, from which the algorithm takes its name.

==The algorithm==

To summarize, the basic quadratic sieve algorithm has these main steps:

# Choose a smoothness bound &quot;B&quot;. The number π(&quot;B&quot;), denoting the number of prime numbers less than &quot;B&quot;, will control both the length of the vectors and the number of vectors needed.
# Use sieving to locate π(&quot;B&quot;) + 1 numbers &quot;ai&quot; such that &quot;bi&quot; = (&quot;ai&quot;2 mod &quot;n&quot;) is &quot;B&quot;-smooth.
#Factor the &quot;bi&quot; and generate exponent vectors mod 2 for each one.
# Use linear algebra to find a subset of these vectors which add to the zero vector. Multiply the corresponding &quot;ai &quot;together and give the result mod &quot;n&quot; the name &quot;a&quot;; similarly, multiply the &quot;bi&quot; together which yields a &quot;B&quot;-smooth square &quot;b&quot;2.
#We are now left with the equality &quot;a&quot;2 = &quot;b&quot;2 mod &quot;n&quot; from which we get two square roots of (&quot;a&quot;2 mod &quot;n&quot;), one by taking the square root in the integers of &quot;b&quot;2 namely &quot;b&quot;, and the other the &quot;a&quot; computed in step 4.
# We now have the desired identity: formula_14. Compute the GCD of &quot;n&quot; with the difference (or sum) of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. This produces a factor, although it may be a trivial factor (&quot;n&quot; or 1). If the factor is trivial, try again with a different linear dependency or different &quot;a&quot;.

The remainder of this article explains details and extensions of this basic algorithm.

==How QS optimizes finding congruences==
The quadratic sieve attempts to find pairs of integers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) (where &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a function of &quot;x&quot;) satisfying a much weaker condition than &quot;x&quot;2 ≡ &quot;y&quot;2 (mod &quot;n&quot;). It selects a set of primes called the &quot;factor base&quot;, and attempts to find &quot;x&quot; such that the least absolute remainder of &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;2 mod &quot;n&quot; factorizes completely over the factor base. Such &quot;y&quot; values are said to be &quot;smooth&quot; with respect to the factor base.

The factorization of a value of &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) that splits over the factor base, together with the value of &quot;x&quot;, is known as a &quot;relation&quot;. The quadratic sieve speeds up the process of finding relations by taking &quot;x&quot; close to the square root of &quot;n&quot;. This ensures that &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) will be smaller, and thus have a greater chance of being smooth.

:formula_15
:formula_16

This implies that &quot;y&quot; is on the order of 2&quot;x&quot;[]. However, it also implies that &quot;y&quot; grows linearly with &quot;x&quot; times the square root of &quot;n&quot;.

Another way to increase the chance of smoothness is by simply increasing the size of the factor base. However, it is necessary to find at least one smooth relation more than the number of primes in the factor base, to ensure the existence of a linear dependency.

===Partial relations and cycles===
Even if for some relation &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is not smooth, it may be possible to merge two of these &quot;partial relations&quot; to form a full one, if the two &quot;y&quot;″s are products of the same prime(s) outside the factor base. [Note that this is equivalent to extending the factor base.] For example, if the factor base is {2, 3, 5, 7} and &quot;n&quot; = 91, there are partial relations:

:formula_17
:formula_18

Multiply these together:

:formula_19

and multiply both sides by (11−1)2 modulo 91. 11−1 modulo 91 is 58, so:

:formula_20
:formula_21

producing a full relation. Such a full relation (obtained by combining partial relations) is called a &quot;cycle&quot;. Sometimes, forming a cycle from two partial relations leads directly to a congruence of squares, but rarely.

===Checking smoothness by sieving===
There are several ways to check for smoothness of the &quot;y&quot;s. The most obvious is by trial division, although this increases the running time for the data collection phase. Another method that has some acceptance is the elliptic curve method (ECM). In practice, a process called &quot;sieving&quot; is typically used. If &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the polynomial formula_22 we have

:formula_23

Thus solving &quot;f(x)&quot; ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;) for &quot;x&quot; generates a whole sequence of numbers &quot;y&quot; for which &quot;y&quot;=&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), all of which are divisible by &quot;p&quot;. This is finding a square root modulo a prime, for which there exist efficient algorithms, such as the Shanks–Tonelli algorithm. (This is where the quadratic sieve gets its name: &quot;y&quot; is a quadratic polynomial in &quot;x&quot;, and the sieving process works like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.)

The sieve starts by setting every entry in a large array &quot;A&quot;[] of bytes to zero. For each &quot;p&quot;, solve the quadratic equation mod &quot;p&quot; to get two roots &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;, and then add an approximation to log(&quot;p&quot;) to every entry for which &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0 mod &quot;p&quot; ... that is, &quot;A&quot;[&quot;kp&quot; + &quot;α&quot;] and &quot;A&quot;[&quot;kp&quot; + &quot;β&quot;]. It is also necessary to solve the quadratic equation modulo small powers of &quot;p&quot; in order to recognise numbers divisible by small powers of a factor-base prime.

At the end of the factor base, any &quot;A&quot;[] containing a value above a threshold of roughly log(&quot;x&quot;2−&quot;n&quot;) will correspond to a value of &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) which splits over the factor base. The information about exactly which primes divide &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) has been lost, but it has only small factors, and there are many good algorithms for factoring a number known to have only small factors, such as trial division by small primes, SQUFOF, Pollard rho, and ECM, which are usually used in some combination.

There are many &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) values that work, so the factorization process at the end doesn&#x27;t have to be entirely reliable; often the processes misbehave on say 5% of inputs, requiring a small amount of extra sieving.

==Example of basic sieve==

This example will demonstrate standard quadratic sieve without logarithm optimizations or prime powers. Let the number to be factored formula_24, therefore the ceiling of the square root of formula_25 is 124. Since formula_25 is small, the basic polynomial formula_27 is enough.

===Data collection===

Since formula_25 is small, only four primes are necessary. The first four primes formula_29 for which 15347 has a square root mod formula_29 are 2, 17, 23, and 29 (in other words, 15347 is a quadratic residue modulo each of these primes). These primes will be the basis for sieving.

Now we construct our sieve formula_31 of formula_32 and begin the sieving process for each prime in the basis, choosing to sieve the first formula_33 of formula_34:

:formula_35

The next step is to perform the sieve. For each formula_29 in our factor base formula_37 solve the equation

:formula_38

to find the entries in the array formula_39 which are divisible by formula_29.

For formula_41 solve formula_42 to get the solution formula_43.

Thus, starting at formula_44 and incrementing by 2, each entry will be divisible by 2. Dividing each of those entries by 2 yields
: formula_45

Similarly for the remaining primes formula_29 in formula_47 the equationformula_48 is solved. Note that for every formula_49, there will be 2 resulting linear equations due to there being 2 modular square roots.

: formula_50

Each equation formula_51 results in formula_52 being divisible by formula_29 at formula_54 and each &quot;p&quot;th value beyond that. Dividing formula_39 by formula_29 at formula_57, formula_58, formula_59, formula_60, etc., for each prime in the basis finds the smooth numbers which are products of unique primes (first powers).

: formula_61

Any entry of formula_39 that equals 1 corresponds to a smooth number. Since formula_63, formula_64, and formula_65 equal one, this corresponds to:

===Matrix processing===

Since smooth numbers formula_66 have been found with the property formula_67, the remainder of the algorithm follows equivalently to any other variation of Dixon&#x27;s factorization method.

Writing the exponents of the product of a subset of the equations 
: formula_68

as a matrixformula_69 yields:
: formula_70

A solution to the equation is given by the left null space, simply 
: formula_71

Thus the product of all three equations yields a square modulo formula_25.

: formula_73
and
: formula_74

So the algorithm found 
: formula_75

Testing the result yields formula_76, a nontrivial factor of 15347, the other being 149.

This demonstration should also serve to show that the quadratic sieve is only appropriate when formula_25 is large. For a number as small as 15347, this algorithm is overkill. Trial division or Pollard rho could have found a factor with much less computation.

==Multiple polynomials==
In practice, many different polynomials are used for &quot;y&quot; so that when &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) starts to become large, resulting in poor density of smooth &quot;y&quot;, this growth can be reset by switching polynomials. As usual, we choose &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to be a square modulo &quot;n&quot;, but now with the form

formula_78

formula_79 is chosen such that formula_80, so formula_81 for some formula_82. The polynomial y(x) can then be written as formula_83. If &quot;A&quot; is a square or a smooth number, then only the factor formula_84 has to be checked for smoothness.

This approach, called Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS), is ideally suited for parallelization, since each processor involved in the factorization can be given &quot;n&quot;, the factor base and a collection of polynomials, and it will have no need to communicate with the central processor until it has finished sieving with its polynomials.

==Large primes==

===One large prime===
If, after dividing by all the factors less than &quot;A&quot;, the remaining part of the number (the cofactor) is less than &quot;A&quot;2, then this cofactor must be prime. In effect, it can be added to the factor base, by sorting the list of relations into order by cofactor. If &quot;y&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = 7⋅11⋅23⋅137 and &quot;y&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = 3⋅5⋅7⋅137, then &quot;y&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)&quot;y&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = 3⋅5⋅72⋅11⋅23⋅1372. This works by reducing the threshold of entries in the sieving array above which a full factorization is performed.

===More large primes===
Reducing the threshold even further, and using an effective process for factoring y(x) values into products of even relatively large primes—ECM is superb for this—can find relations with most of their factors in the factor base, but with two or even three larger primes. Cycle finding then allows combining a set of relations sharing several primes into a single relation.

==Parameters from realistic example==

To illustrate typical parameter choices for a realistic example on a real implementation including the multiple polynomial and large prime optimizations, the tool msieve was run on a 267-bit semiprime, producing the following parameters:

* Trial factoring cutoff: 27 bits
* Sieve interval (per polynomial): 393216 (12 blocks of size 32768)
* Smoothness bound: 1300967 (50294 primes)
* Number of factors for polynomial &quot;A&quot; coefficients: 10 &quot;(see Multiple polynomials above)&quot;
* Large prime bound: 128795733 (26 bits) &quot;(see Large primes above)&quot;
* Smooth values found: 25952 by sieving directly, 24462 by combining numbers with large primes
* Final matrix size: 50294 × 50414, reduced by filtering to 35750 × 35862
* Nontrivial dependencies found: 15
* Total time (on a 1.6 GHz UltraSPARC III): 35 min 39 seconds
* Maximum memory used: 8 MB

==Factoring records==
Until the discovery of the number field sieve (NFS), QS was the asymptotically fastest known general-purpose factoring algorithm. Now, Lenstra elliptic curve factorization has the same asymptotic running time as QS (in the case where &quot;n&quot; has exactly two prime factors of equal size), but in practice, QS is faster since it uses single-precision operations instead of the multi-precision operations used by the elliptic curve method.

On April 2, 1994, the factorization of RSA-129 was completed using QS. It was a 129-digit number, the product of two large primes, one of 64 digits and the other of 65 digits. The factor base for this factorization contained 524339 primes. The data collection phase took 5000 MIPS-years, done in distributed fashion over the Internet. The data collected totaled 2GB. The data processing phase took 45 hours on Bellcore&#x27;s (now Telcordia Technologies) MasPar (massively parallel) supercomputer. This was the largest published factorization by a general-purpose algorithm, until NFS was used to factor RSA-130, completed April 10, 1996. All RSA numbers factored since then have been factored using NFS.

The current QS factorization record is the 140-digit (463-bit) RSA-140, which was factored by Patrick Konsor in June 2020 using approximately 6,000 core hours over 6 days.

== Implementations ==
* PPMPQS and PPSIQS
* SIMPQS is a fast implementation of the self-initialising multiple polynomial quadratic sieve written by William Hart. It provides support for the large prime variant and uses Jason Papadopoulos&#x27; block Lanczos implementation for the linear algebra stage. SIMPQS is accessible as the qsieve command in the SageMath computer algebra package, is part of the Fast Library for Number Theory, or can be downloaded in source form. SIMPQS is optimized for use on Athlon and Opteron machines, but will operate on most common 32- and 64-bit architectures. It is written entirely in C.
* A factoring applet by Dario Alpern, that uses the quadratic sieve if certain conditions are met.
* The PARI/GP computer algebra package includes an implementation of the self-initialising multiple polynomial quadratic sieve implementing the large prime variant. It was adapted by Thomas Papanikolaou and Xavier Roblot from a sieve written for the LiDIA project. The self-initialisation scheme is based on an idea from the thesis of Thomas Sosnowski.
* A variant of the quadratic sieve is available in the MAGMA computer algebra package. It is based on an implementation of Arjen Lenstra from 1995, used in his &quot;factoring by email&quot; program.
* msieve, an implementation of the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve with support for single and double large primes, written by Jason Papadopoulos. Source code and a Windows binary are available.
* YAFU, written by Ben Buhrow, is probably the fastest available implementation of the quadratic sieve. For example, RSA-100 was factored in less than 15 minutes on four cores of a 2.5 GHz Xeon 6248 CPU. All of the critical subroutines make use of AVX2 or AVX-512 SIMD instructions for AMD or Intel processors. It uses Jason Papadopoulos&#x27; block Lanczos code. Source code and binaries for Windows and Linux are available.
* Ariel, a simple Java implementation of the quadratic sieve for didactic purposes.
* The java-math-library contains probably the fastest quadratic sieve written in Java (the successor of PSIQS 4.0).
* Java QS, an open source Java project containing basic implementation of QS. Released at February 4, 2016 by Ilya Gazman
* C Quadratic Sieve, a factorizer written entirely in C containing a self-initializing Quadratic Sieve implementation. The software released in 2022 can factor numbers in batches with JSON or CSV output. Its source code by Michel Leonard does not rely on an external library to factor 240-bit numbers in a minute and 300-bit numbers in 2 hours.
* The RcppBigIntAlgos package by Joseph Wood, provides an efficient implementation of the multiple polynomial quadratic sieve for the R programming language. It is written in C++ and is capable of comfortably factoring 100-digit semiprimes. For example, a 300-bit semiprime (91 digits) was factored in 1 hour and the RSA-100 was factored in under 10 hours on a MacBook Air with an Apple M2 processor.

<doc id="582349" wikidata="Q4970692" url="?curid=582349" title="British Rail Class 09">
<text>The British Rail Class 09 is a class of 0-6-0 diesel locomotive designed primarily for shunting and short-distance freight trips along branch lines.

The 26 locos are nearly identical to the more numerous Class 08 shunting locomotives but have different gearing, giving a higher top speed of 27.5 mph (44 km/h) at the expense of a lower tractive effort. They were introduced from 1959 to 1962 and latterly operated in the Southern Region of British Railways, although some of the class were originally allocated to depots in the Midlands and North. Further locomotives were converted from Class 08 in 1992 and, following this and privatisation in 1997, the class has been distributed much further afield.

==Passenger operations==
Although not normally considered for passenger work, Class 09s were recorded working passenger trains between Clapham Junction and Kensington Olympia when the booked Class 33 diesel was unavailable.

They were also used on railtours which needed to depart Brighton heading along the West Coastway Line or &quot;vice versa&quot;. To achieve this the 09 worked between Brighton and Preston Park, allowing the main tour locomotive to work the train forward via the Cliftonville tunnel and Hove. The connection to the West Coastway Line at Brighton can only be used by four car trains due to the arrangement of the points and track.

==Liveries==
===Post-Privatisation===
The following liveries have been carried since the privatisation of British Rail:
* 09006/007/019/024 carried Mainline Freight livery
* 09008 in EWS livery
* 09025 in Connex livery
* 09204 in Arriva TrainCare livery
* 09201 in Railfreight grey and is currently in the Knottingley area working at EWS Depot

==Sub-classes==
The original 26 locomotives (built 1959–1962) became sub-class 09/0 when further locomotives were modified from Class 08s in 1992 which became subclasses Classes 09/1 and 09/2.
There were variations, which were given the following TOPS design codes:
===Class 09/0===

===Classes 09/1 &amp; 09/2===

==Preservation==
12 members of the class have been preserved

* 09001 Ex DB Schenker at Peak Rail (Heritage Shunters Trust)
* D3668 (09004) at Swindon &amp; Cricklade Railway
* D3721 (09010) at South Devon Railway
* D4100 (09012) &quot;Dick Hardy&quot; at Severn Valley Railway
* 09015 at Avon Valley Railway 
* 09017 at National Railway Museum
* 09018 at Bluebell Railway
* 09019 at West Somerset Railway
* 09024 at East Lancashire Railway
* D4113 (09025) at Lavender Line
* 09026 &quot;Cedric Wares&quot; at Spa Valley Railway
* 09107 at Severn Valley Railway
==Model railways==
Lima produced a range of Class 09s in OO gauge.

Hornby Railways and Bachmann have also produced 00 gauge models of Class 09 locomotives.

<text>Estrées-la-Campagne () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

It is one of many villages in the north of France bearing the name &quot;Estrées&quot;. The etymology of the name is from &quot;strata&quot; (cognate of English &quot;street&quot;), the word for the stone-layered Roman roads in the area (some of which turned into modern highways). Hence &quot;Estreti&quot;, &quot;village on the road&quot; which developed into &quot;Estrées&quot;.

<doc id="582372" wikidata="Q1067811" url="?curid=582372" title="Charter Oak">
<text>The Charter Oak was an enormous white oak tree growing on Wyllys Hill in Hartford, Connecticut, from around the 12th or 13th century until it fell during a storm in 1856. Connecticut colonists hid Connecticut&#x27;s Royal Charter of 1662 within the tree&#x27;s hollow to thwart its confiscation by the English governor-general. The oak symbolized American independence and was commemorated on the Connecticut State Quarter. It was also depicted on a commemorative half dollar and a postage stamp in 1935, Connecticut&#x27;s tercentennial.

==Early history==
In the 1630s, a delegation of local Indians approached Samuel Wyllys, the settler who owned and cleared much of the land around Hartford, to encourage preservation of the tree, describing it as having been planted ceremonially for the sake of peace when their tribe first settled in the area:
===Incident===
The name &quot;Charter Oak&quot; stems from the event in late 1687, when Connecticut colonists used it as a hiding place for the Charter of 1662.

King Charles II granted the Connecticut Colony an unusual degree of autonomy in 1662. His successor James II consolidated several colonies into the Dominion of New England in 1686, in part to take firmer control of them. He later appointed Sir Edmund Andros as governor-general over it, who stated that his appointment had invalidated the charters of the various constituent colonies. He went to each colony to collect their charters, presumably seeing symbolic value in physically reclaiming the documents. Andros arrived in Hartford late in October 1687, where his mission was at least as unwelcome as it had been in the other colonies.

The incident took place on October 31, 1687, in the upper room at Zachariah Sanford&#x27;s tavern. Andros demanded the document, and the colonists produced it, but the candle lights were suddenly doused during the ensuing discussion. The colonists spirited the document out a window, and Captain Joseph Wadsworth carried it to the oak tree.

In 1900, it was suggested that a copy was surreptitiously substituted for the original in June 1687 and the original was hidden in the oak lest Andros find it in any search of buildings. The Museum of Connecticut History credits the idea that Andros never got the original charter and displays a parchment that it regards as the original. The Connecticut Historical Society possesses a fragment of it.

Andros was overthrown in Boston two years later in the 1689 Boston revolt, and the Dominion of New England was dissolved.

==Relics==
The oak was blown down by a violent, tempestuous storm on August 21, 1856, and its timber was made into many chairs now displayed in the Hartford Capitol Building. The desk of the Governor of Connecticut and the chairs for the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate in the state capitol were made from wood salvaged from the Charter Oak. Another chair was made by noted painter Frederic Church, a native of Hartford, and is still on display at his former home.

Charter Oak Engine Co. No. 1 presented a wooden baseball made from the Charter Oak to the Charter Oak Base Ball Club of Brooklyn on September 20, 1860.

Supporters of President Andrew Johnson presented him with a cane made from a branch of the oak in January 1868, as impeachment proceedings were underway.

In 1868, Mark Twain wrote of a trip that he took to Hartford and mused on the pride that his guide showed in the uses to which the lumber of the Charter Oak had been put:
Anything that is made of its wood is deeply venerated by the inhabitants, and is regarded as very precious. I went all about the town with a citizen whose ancestors came over with the Pilgrims in the Quaker City – in the Mayflower, I should say — and he showed me all the historic relics of Hartford. He showed me a beautiful carved chair in the Senate Chamber, where the bewigged and awfully homely old-time governors of the Commonwealth frown from their canvas overhead. &quot;Made from Charter Oak,&quot; he said. I gazed upon it with inexpressible solicitude. He showed me another carved chair in the House, &quot;Charter Oak,&quot; he said. I gazed again with interest. Then he looked at the rusty, stained, and famous old Charter, and presently I turned to move away. But he solemnly drew me back and pointed to the frame. &quot;Charter Oak,&quot; said he. I worshipped. We went down to Wadsworth&#x27;s Atheneum, and I wanted to look at the pictures; but he conveyed me silently to a corner, and pointed to a log, rudely shaped somewhat like a chair, and whispered, &quot;Charter Oak.&quot; I exhibited the accustomed reverence. He showed me a walking stick, a needlecase, a dog-collar, a three-legged stool, a boot-jack, a dinner-table, a ten-pin alley, a toothpicker —

I interrupted him and said, &quot;Never mind – we&#x27;ll bunch the whole lumber-yard, and call it—&quot;

&quot;Charter Oak,&quot; he said.

&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;now let us go and see some Charter Oak, for a change.&quot;

I meant that for a joke; But how was he to know that, being a stranger? He took me around and showed me Charter Oak enough to build a plank-road from here to Great Salt Lake City...

==Scions and descendants==

Charter Oak fell during a storm on August 21, 1857, and residents collected many acorns and planted them in cities and towns across the state. These trees are known as &quot;Charter Oak scions,&quot; and they were often planted in parks, town greens, cemeteries, and near post offices and town halls. Many of them are marked with plaques and monuments, but others are anonymous. The total number of Charter Oak scions is unknown, but was probably near 100.

As these scions grew to maturity, their acorns and seedlings were distributed around the state to mark civic occasions. Such occasions included George Washington&#x27;s 200th birthday in 1932, the 300th anniversary of the charter in 1962, the new state constitution in 1965, and the national bicentennial in 1976. Each of these celebrations was marked by the distribution and planting of Charter Oak seedlings in Connecticut and elsewhere. Two were even sent to France and planted at the Versailles palace.

The Hoadley Oak is a Charter Oak scion in Hartford&#x27;s Bushnell Park, estimated to be over 120 years of age. It was cut down by the city in February 2023 after &quot;considerable rotting,&quot; perhaps due to an extended drought. A local artist plans to convert the remaining stump to an &quot;interactive art piece&quot;.

==In literature==
Lydia Sigourney published two poems on this tree. The first is , in her 1827 collection of poetry. Here she remarks that this poem was occasioned by the death of the last proprietor of the name of Wyllys, in whose family this estate had remained since the country&#x27;s first settlement. The second is , in &quot;Scenes in My Native Land&quot; (1845), which is accompanied by descriptive text.

<text>Huacho () is a city in Peru, capital of the Huaura Province and capital of the Lima Region. Also is the most populated city of the Lima Region and Norte Chico. It is located 223 feet (68 metres) above sea level and 148 km north of the city of Lima. The city is located on the Pan-American Highway and it is close to the Lachay National Reserve, so it has extensive vegetation and wildlife.

== Geography ==

Settled on the bottom of a wide bay, its climate is wet and appealing. In the surrounding areas there are rice, cotton, sugarcane and different grain fields. This fact has allowed the rise of a rather important cotton industry, as well as cotton and oil factories. Within its natural landscape, its salt mines and its beaches (such as El Paraíso) are of great interest. Huacho was one of the main trade centers of northern Lima.

==History==

Under the viceroy of Francisco de Toledo, who decided to group the &quot;ayllus&quot; of the Indians who were established in that area into reductions. The site chosen was that of &quot;Gaucho Bay.&quot; Consequently, on 25 August 1571, the reduction was named San Bartolomé de Guachu.

During the Viceroyalty of Peru, the city belonged to the province of Huara and was established as a trading and fishing port. In 1774 the Viceroy José Antonio de Mendoza granted Huacho the category of &quot;pueblo&quot; and with it, allowed it to build its main plaza.

Huacho was, like Huaura, a pueblo that received and hosted the members of the liberation expedition led by José de San Martín, participating on 26 November 1820 of the &quot;Grito libertador en el balcéon de Huaura&quot;, on the subject of historical verification.

On 12 February 1821, Huacho was elevated to district, belonging to the province of Chancay, in the department of Lima. The Congress conceded the title of &quot;Fidelísima Villa&quot; (most faithful) on 11 April 1828, under the presidency of Don José de La Mar. On 24 January 1830, the province of Chancay was unified with the province of Lima and Santa in the department of Ancash. Huaura was established as the capital of the province of Chancay. Thirty years before, on January 23, 1866, Huacho was established as the capital of Chancay.

Due to its technological advances, in 1892, the city began a city tram service, an animal transportation service called &quot;tranvías de sangre&quot; (blood tram), which was said to have used mules or horses. This service extended to Huara, and was electrified in 1920, making Huacho the first city after Lima to have its own electric tram system.

Beginning in 1911, it was the main hub of the Ferrocarril Noroeste del Perú (Northwestern Train of Peru), which connected Huacho with Ancón, Sayan, and Barranca.

On November 10, 1874, Huacho was elevated to the category of city and was made capital of the province even when it was separated from Chancay (today the province of Huaral), and the province of Huaura was created. Next the city of Huacho was also the capital of the Prefecture of Lima, and now is the capital of the Governal Region of Lima.

==Archaeology==
South of the city of Huacho is located a large archaeological site of Bandurria, Peru. Its history goes back to 4,000 BC.

==Culture==
Huacho is home to the annual Guinea Pig Festival.

Its gastronomy is represented by the Salchicha Huachana.

<doc id="582377" wikidata="Q615175" url="?curid=582377" title="Shirley (novel)">
<text>Shirley, A Tale is an 1849 social novel by the English novelist Charlotte Brontë. It was Brontë&#x27;s second published novel after &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (originally published under Brontë&#x27;s pseudonym Currer Bell). The novel is set in Yorkshire in 1811–12, during the industrial depression resulting from the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. The novel is set against the backdrop of the Luddite uprisings in the Yorkshire textile industry.

The novel&#x27;s popularity led to the surname Shirley becoming popular as a first name for women. Brontë tells the reader it was a tradition in the family to only give this surname as a first name to male children. It wasn&#x27;t commonly used as a first name in England before the book. It is now regarded as a female first name.

==Background==
While Charlotte Brontë was writing &quot;Shirley&quot;, three of her siblings died. Her brother Branwell died in September 1848, and her sister Emily fell ill and died in December. Brontë resumed writing, but then her only remaining sibling, her sister Anne, became ill and died in May 1849.

Some critics believe that the character of Caroline Helstone was loosely based on Anne and it has been speculated that Brontë originally planned to let Caroline die but changed her mind because of her family tragedies. However, Ellen Nussey, Charlotte&#x27;s lifelong friend, claimed that the character of Caroline was based on herself. 

Charlotte Brontë told Elizabeth Gaskell that Shirley is what she believed her sister, Emily Brontë, would have been if she had been born into a wealthy family. Again, Ellen Nussey, who knew Emily as well as anyone outside the family, did not recognise Emily in Shirley. 

The maiden name of Mrs Pryor is Agnes Grey, the name of the main character in Anne&#x27;s first novel. She was based on Margaret Wooler, the principal of Roe Head School, which Brontë attended as both student and teacher.

==Locations==
The novel is set in and around the Spen Valley in what is now called West Yorkshire (then the West Riding of Yorkshire). This area is now known as &quot;Shirley country&quot; to some locals. Briarmains, a house mentioned in the novel, is based on the Red House in Gomersal, where Mary Taylor, a friend of Charlotte, lived. The house is currently closed but previously open as a museum. Fieldhead, another house in the novel, is based on the Elizabethan manor house Oakwell Hall, which is also now a museum. The attack on Robert Moore&#x27;s mill was based on the Luddite attack on Cartwright&#x27;s Mill at Rawfolds, Liversedge, though it is believed that Charlotte also took some inspiration from Taylor&#x27;s Mill at Hunsworth. Charlotte&#x27;s father Patrick Bronte had lived in the Hightown area of Liversedge for a while, and Charlotte knew the area well.

==Plot summary==
Robert Moore is a mill owner noted for apparent ruthlessness towards his employees. He has laid off many of them, and is apparently indifferent to their consequent impoverishment. In fact, he had no choice, since the mill is deeply in debt. He is determined to restore his family&#x27;s honour and fortune.

As the novel opens, Robert awaits delivery of new labour-saving machinery for the mill, which will enable him to lay off additional employees. Together with some friends, he watches all night, but the machinery is destroyed by &quot;frame-breakers&quot; on the way to the mill. Robert&#x27;s business difficulties continue, due in part to continuing labour unrest, but even more to the Napoleonic Wars and the accompanying Orders in Council, which forbid British merchants from trading in American markets.

Robert is very close to his cousin Caroline Helstone, who comes to his house to be taught French by his sister, Hortense. Caroline worships Robert. Caroline&#x27;s father is dead and her mother has abandoned her, leaving her to be brought up by her uncle, Rev. Matthew Helstone. To keep himself from falling in love with her Robert keeps his distance, since he cannot afford to marry for pleasure or for love. 

Caroline realises that Robert is growing increasingly distant and withdraws into herself. Her uncle does not sympathise with her &quot;fancies&quot;. She has no money of her own, so she cannot leave, which is what she longs to do. She suggests that she might take up the role of governess, but her uncle dismisses the idea and assures her that she need not work for a living.

Caroline recovers somewhat when she meets Shirley, an independent heiress whose parents are dead and who lives with Mrs Pryor, her former governess. Shirley is lively, cheerful, full of ideas about how to use her money and how to help people, and very interested in business. Caroline and Shirley soon become close friends. Caroline becomes convinced that Shirley and Robert will marry. Shirley likes Robert, is very interested in his work, and is concerned about him and the threats he receives from laid-off millworkers. Both good and bad former employees are depicted. Some passages show the real suffering of those who were honest workers and can no longer find good employment; other passages show how some people use losing their jobs as an excuse to get drunk, fight with their previous employers, and incite other people to violence. Shirley uses her money to help the poorest, but she is also motivated by the desire to prevent any attack on Robert.

One night, Rev. Matthew Helstone asks Shirley to stay with Caroline while he is away. Caroline and Shirley realise that an attack on the mill is imminent. They hear the dog barking and realise that a group of rioters has come to a halt outside the rectory. They overhear the rioters talking about entering the house, but are relieved when they decide to go on. The women go to the mill together to warn Robert, but they are too late. They witness the ensuing battle from their hiding place.

The whole neighbourhood becomes convinced that Robert and Shirley will marry. The anticipation of this event causes Caroline to fall ill. Mrs Pryor comes to look after her and learns the cause of Caroline&#x27;s sorrow. She continues her vigil even as Caroline worsens daily. Mrs Pryor then reveals to Caroline that she is Caroline&#x27;s mother. She had abandoned her because Caroline looked exactly like her father, the husband who tortured Mrs Pryor and made her life miserable. She had little money, so when her brother-in-law offered to bring up the child, she accepted the offer, took up the name of Pryor and went off to become a governess. Caroline now has a reason to live, since she knows that she can go and live with her mother, and begins to recover.

Shirley&#x27;s uncle and aunt come to visit her. They bring with them their daughters, their son, and their son&#x27;s tutor, Louis Moore. He is Robert&#x27;s younger brother and taught Shirley when she was younger. Caroline is puzzled by Shirley&#x27;s haughty and formal behaviour towards Louis. Two men fall in love with Shirley and woo her, but she rejects both of them because she does not love them. The relationship between Shirley and Louis, meanwhile, remains ambivalent. There are days when Louis can ask Shirley to come to the schoolroom and recite the French pieces she learned from him when she was younger. On other days Shirley ignores Louis. However, when Shirley is upset the only person she can confide in is Louis. After a supposedly mad dog bites Shirley and makes her think that she is to die early, no one except Louis can make her reveal her fears.

Robert returns one dark night, first stopping at the market and then returning to his home with a friend. The friend asks him why he left when it seemed so certain that Shirley loved him and would have married him. Robert replies that he had assumed the same, and that he had proposed to Shirley before he left. Shirley had at first laughed, thinking that he was not serious, and then cried when she discovered that he was. She had told him that she knew that he did not love her, and that he asked for her hand not for her sake, but for her wealth. Robert had walked away filled with a sense of humiliation, even as he knew that she was right. This self-disgust had driven Robert away to London, where he realised that restoring the family name was not as important as maintaining his self-respect. He had returned home determined to close the mill if he had to, and go away to Canada to make his fortune. Just as Robert finishes his narration, his friend hears a gunshot and Robert falls from his horse. 

The friend takes Robert to his own home and looks after him. After a turn for the worse, Robert slowly gets better. A visit from Caroline revives him, but she has to come secretly, hiding from her uncle and his friend and his family. Robert soon moves back to his own home and persuades his sister that the very thing their house needs to cheer it up is a visit from Caroline. Robert asks for Caroline&#x27;s forgiveness. 

Louis proposes to Shirley, despite the difference in their relative situations, and Shirley agrees to marry him. At first Caroline is to be Shirley&#x27;s bridesmaid, but Robert proposes to her and she accepts. The novel ends with Caroline marrying Robert and Shirley marrying Louis.
==Characters==
The four central characters are studies in contrast: the two friends Caroline Helstone and Shirley Keeldar, and their lovers, the brothers Robert and Louis Gérard Moore.

* Robert Gérard Moore – An industrialist whose textile mill is idle because of the war. Perceived as an outsider because he comes from Antwerp, even though he is a cousin of Caroline&#x27;s. Robert Moore installs new labour-saving machinery in his mill and becomes the target of Luddite attacks.
* Louis Gérard Moore – Robert&#x27;s brother, working as a tutor for Shirley&#x27;s uncle.
* Caroline Helstone – A timid and uncertain, but also wise and capable young woman, the niece of Rev. Helstone and best friend of Shirley.
* Shirley Keeldar – An orphaned heiress to a fortune. A headstrong, independent and determined young woman.

Other characters in the novel include:

* Rev. Matthew Helstone – Caroline&#x27;s uncle. A fierce man, who is not cruel, but still shows little affection for his niece. Marriage has made him distrustful of women in general.
* Hortense Gérard Moore – Robert and Louis&#x27;s sister.
* Hiram Yorke – A local landowner.
* Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Scott – Robert Moore&#x27;s foreman at the mill.
* Mrs Pryor – Shirley&#x27;s timid but wise governess, who moves to Fieldhead together with Shirley. She eventually turns out to be Caroline&#x27;s long-lost mother, Mrs Agnes Helstone.
* The three curates of the three parishes – the Anglo-Irishman Peter Malone, the Cockney Joseph Donne, and the amiable Davy Sweeting.
* William Farren – a hardworking, patient worker. The book&#x27;s example of the perfect working-class man.

==Style==

Unlike &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, which is written in the first person and narrated by the title character, &quot;Shirley&quot; is narrated by an omniscient but unnamed third-person narrator. For her third novel &quot;Villette&quot;, Brontë returned to first-person narration.

==Adaptations==

The novel has been adapted to the screen only once, in 1922. The silent adaptation was directed by A. V. Bramble and Carlotta Breese starred as the title character.

In March 2014, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a ten-episode dramatisation by Rachel Joyce in the station&#x27;s &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; slot. Narrated by Lesley Sharp, the series starred Joanne Froggatt as Caroline and Jemima Rooper as Shirley.

==Critical reception==

Coming soon after &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, which was extremely successful, &quot;Shirley&quot; originally received a muted reception from critics.

<text>World Sailing (WS) is the international sports governing body for sailing; it is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).

==History==
The creation of the International Yacht Racing Union (IYRU) began in 1904, when Major Brooke Heckstall-Smith AINA, then Secretary of the Yacht Racing Association (now the Royal Yachting Association) wrote to the Yacht Club de France, pointing out the desirability of holding a conference for the purpose of devising an International Rule of Measurement for Racing Yachts acceptable to all European countries. As a result, an International Conference of Yacht Measurement was held in London in January and June 1906, at which the Metre Rule was developed. This group went on to adopt a formal Constitution after a meeting at the Yacht Club de France in Paris on 14 October 1907 which is seen as the formation date of the International Yacht Racing Union.

On 5 August 1996, the IYRU changed its name to the International Sailing Federation (ISAF).

On 14 November 2015, ISAF changed its name to World Sailing.

==Competition formats==
Competitive sailing regatta contain events which are defined by a combination of discipline, equipment, gender and sometimes categories. These criteria are defined by the race purpose.

===Disciplines===
The following are the main disciplines:
* Fleet racing – The most common form of competitive sailing involving boats racing around a course.
* Match racing – Two identical boats race against each other. This one-on-one duel requires strategy and tactics. The first to cross the finish line wins.
* Team racing – Two teams each of normally three boats compete against each other. Fast-paced racing depends on excellent boat handling skills and rapid tactical decision making.
* Offshore/oceanic – Any offshore race over 800 miles, including races around the world.
* Speed sailing - Is managed by World Sailing Speed Record Council
* Wave riding is common to board sports
* Both windsurfing and kiteboarding are experimenting with new formats.
* Cruising – Can be a coastal day sail or a longer distance international journey, it is the most commonly enjoyed sailing discipline.

===Equipment===
Common categories of equipment include the following: dinghies, multihulls, keelboats, sailing yacht, windsurfers, kiteboarding and radio-controlled sailboats. Within these categories normally specific class or rating system are used.

===Gender===
The majority of sailing events are &quot;open&quot; events in which males and females compete together on equal terms either as individuals or part of team. Sailing has had female only World Championships since the 1970s to encourage participation and now host more than 30 such World Championship titles each year. For the 2016 Olympics, compulsory mixed gender in the event was added for the first time.

===Sailor categories===
In addition the following categories are sometimes applied to events:
* Age
* Nationality
* Disabled classification
* Sailor classification

==Rules and regulations==
World Sailing is now most familiar to sailors for defining the Racing Rules of Sailing (RRS), the international standard used to define competition rules and the framework within which racing is conducted.

Para sailing regattas for para sailors likewise follow the World Sailing rulebook with a minor change to permit things like powered adaptations. Strict classification requirements are enforced in the Paralympic Games for fair competition in Paralympic-class keelboats.

The key documents under control of World Sailing are:
* Racing Rules of Sailing (RRS) – The RRS Rulebook is updated on every Olympic year.
* Equipment Rules of Sailing (ERS)
* Offshore Special Regulations (OSR)
* World Sailing Regulations and Constitution

==Membership==

===National members===

Like all sports federations, World Sailing is composed of &quot;Member National Authorities&quot; (MNA&#x27;s) from over 140 countries all of whom have the right to make submissions to determine World Sailing&#x27;s policies.

Persons with a physical impairment who are interested to learn to sail are encouraged to locate their national World Sailing Member National Authority (MNA), Disabled Sports Organization, or visit the local sailing club, as World Sailing seeks to people with disabilities into the sport.

===Class associations===

The federation recognizes over 80 classes which are each entitled to hold world championships.

===Affiliated members===
* Offshore Racing Congress (ORC)
* World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC)
* International Radio Sailing Association (IRSA)

==Events==

* Sailing World Championships this is held every four years and is the combined World Championships for the Olympic classes and used as part of the Olympic Qualifying procedure

===Sailing in the Paralympic Games===

Sailing as an equipment based sports allows one of the largest ranges of paralympians to compete under equal terms. Sailing was included for the first time in the Atlanta 1996 Paralympic Games program as a demonstration event. It became a full medal sport at the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games up to 2020 were IPC removed sailing from the paralympic program. Work continues to get sailing reinstated for the 2028 Paralympics.

==Disabled sailing==
Sailing is a versatile sport that can accommodate many types of disability primarily because it is equipment based. Sailing is one of the few sports where disabled sailors compete on equal terms to able body sailors in a large section of the sport. Almost any boat can be sailed though some are more suitable for larger ranges of disabilities or specific categories of impairment.

World Sailing is also responsible for disabled sailing worldwide under the guidance of its own brand Para World Sailing. This is since the merger of International Association for Disabled Sailing (IFDS) in November 2014, and re-forming of the World Sailing Committee later rebrand Para World Sailing. The rational was given as follows: &quot;The creation of a single governing body for Member National Authorities (MNAs) and sailors will better serve the needs and interests of sailors with disabilities, and provide consistency within the sport, from relationships with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to technical support and operational efficiencies.&quot;

The IFDS Foundation was dissolved during the 2015 Annual Conference in Sanya, China. The Disabled Sailing Committee then re-branded as the Para World Sailing Committee.

<text>Russell is a police village that is part of Russell Township in the United Counties of Prescott and Russell in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is located immediately east of Ottawa, the city limits of which are just over 2km west of Russell. Ottawa&#x27;s downtown core is about 40km (25mi) northwest of Russell.
The 2016 Census stated that the community had a population of 4,464, making it the second largest community in the township of Russell (Russell&#x27;s neighbour to the east, Embrun, is the largest community in Russell Township). The vast majority of its residents work in the city of Ottawa, making Russell a true bedroom community for commuters to Ottawa. Agriculture is the main industry in and immediately around the village.

The town produces a large number of hockey prospects for development leagues such as the OHL, OJHL, and NCJHL. The most notable contributions are to the Embrun Panthers Jr. C hockey team.

The town has a significant number of schools for its size – English Catholic Elementary (Mother Teresa Catholic School) and Secondary (St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic High School), English Public Elementary and Secondary (Russell High School) and French Elementary school (École Saint-Joseph) . 

Russell also has a summer swimming pool, a skating arena, a library, an all-weather running track and a curling rink. The village also has its firehall on the south end. Russell is policed by the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP). The Russell Watch Program is a community watch where volunteers patrol the village as a second set of eyes and ears for the OPP. Patrols are mostly made during the evening and into the late night. Commercial, recreational, and residential areas are all monitored frequently after dusk.

The village has practicing lawyers, doctors, dentists and other professionals. It also has grocery store, pharmacy, garage, restaurants and many little shops. 

The Castor River (translated from French means &quot;Beaver&quot;) runs through the town in summer and offers a flat trail for snowmobiles during the winter.

The village passed a local bylaw requiring all commercial signage to be bilingual. This bylaw is being challenged by many, in one case in court.

Russell is a predominantly English-speaking community, although with a sizeable French-speaking minority. 87% of the community speaks English at home, while 11% speak French at home.

The travel time to the nearest built-up areas of Ottawa is typically 20–25 minutes. In the rush hour it can take up to one hour to reach downtown Ottawa, and much more to reach Ottawa boroughs west of the core zone.

In terms of ethnic origin, the people of Russell are mainly of Anglo-Celtic descent, although there are significant populations of Dutch, French, and German descent.

<text>Janggi (, also romanized as &quot;changgi&quot; or &quot;jangki&quot;), sometimes called Korean chess, is a strategy board game popular on the Korean Peninsula. The game was derived from xiangqi (Chinese chess), and is very similar to it, including the starting position of some of the pieces, and the 9×10 gameboard, but without the xiangqi &quot;river&quot; dividing the board horizontally in the middle.

Janggi is played on a board nine lines wide by ten lines long. The game is sometimes fast paced due to the jumping cannons and the long-range elephants, but professional games most often last over 150 moves and so are typically slower than those of Western chess.

In 2009, the first world janggi tournament was held in Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.

==Rules==

===Board===
The board is composed of 90 intersections of 9 vertical files and 10 horizontal rows. The board has nearly the same layout as that used in xiangqi, except the janggi board has no &quot;river&quot; in the central row. The pieces consist of disks marked with identifying characters and are placed on the line intersections (as in the Chinese games xiangqi and Go). Janggi pieces are traditionally octagonal in shape, and differ in size according to their rank. The sides are Blue (or sometimes Green), which moves first, versus Red. Each side has a &quot;palace&quot; that is three lines by three lines (nine positions) in the centre of their side of the board against the back edge. The palace contains four diagonal lines extending outwards from the centre, forming an &quot;X&quot; shape.

The spacing between vertical lines is slightly wider than the spacing between horizontal lines. Therefore, the space created by the vertical and horizontal lines takes the shape of a slightly wide rectangle.

===Pieces===
The pieces are labelled with hanja (; &quot;Chinese characters&quot;). The characters on the red pieces are all written in the regular script (; haeseo &quot;Regular script&quot;) while the blue/green pieces are all written in the cursive script (; choseo &quot;Grass script&quot;).

====General====

The pieces that are equivalent to the kings in Western chess are actually referred to as generals ( &quot;janggun&quot;) in Korean. They are labelled with the Chinese character &quot;Han&quot; 한 (in Chinese pinyin: &quot;Hàn&quot;; ) on the red side, and &quot;Cho&quot; 초 (&quot;Chǔ&quot;; ) on the blue side. They represent the rival states of Han and Chu that fought for power in the post-Qin dynasty interregnum period in China (see Chu–Han contention). In North Korea, the Chu–Han setup is not used; the red general there is called &quot;jang&quot; (, &quot;general&quot;) and the blue general is called &quot;gwan&quot; (, &quot;minister&quot;). Both kings can also be referred to generally as &quot;gung&quot; (, &quot;palace&quot;).

Janggi differs from its Chinese counterpart in that the janggi general starts the game from the central intersection of the palace, rather than from the centre intersection of the back edge. The general may move one step per turn along marked board lines to any of the nine points within the palace. There are four diagonal lines in the palace connecting the centre position to the corners. When the general is checkmated the game is lost. The general cannot leave the palace under any circumstances. If the generals come to face each other across the board, and the player to move does not move away, this is &quot;bikjang&quot;—a draw. This rule is different from that of xiangqi where it is illegal for the generals to face.

In janggi, a player may pass his turn, which is called &quot;한수쉼 (han-soo-swim)&quot;. Unless the general is in check, there is no restriction on when or how many times one can pass during the game. The game ends up a draw if both side pass. Stalemate does not result in the end of a game in janggi; if a player has no legal move left, he is just forced to pass and the other player can still continue.

In the diagram below, the blue general can move diagonally (provided that these points are not attacked by enemy pieces), but the red general cannot, since there are no diagonal markings at that point.

====Guards====

The pieces are labeled &quot;sa&quot; 사 () and are civilian government officials (i.e. council members serving the commander in chief). They are often called guards, since they stay close to the general. Other names are assistants or mandarins.

The guards start to the left and right of the general on the first rank. They move the same as the general, one step per turn along marked lines in the palace. The guards are one of the weakest pieces because they may not leave the palace. They are valuable for protecting the general.

====Horses====

Called the horse or &quot;ma&quot; 마 (). The horse moves one step orthogonally then one step diagonally outward, with no jumping. If there is a piece on its first step (the red circles in the diagram), it&#x27;s restricted from moving in that direction. This piece is exactly the same as the horse in xiangqi. A horse can be transposed with an adjacent elephant in the initial setup.

====Elephants====

The elephants or &quot;sang&quot; 상 () begin the game to the left and right of the guards. They move one point orthogonally followed by two points diagonally away from their starting point, ending on the opposite corner of a 2×3 rectangle. Like the horse, the elephant is blocked from moving by any intervening pieces (the red circles in the diagram). Unlike xiangqi, which confines elephants to their own side of the board behind a &quot;river&quot;, in janggi there is no river and elephants are not limited to one side of the board. The janggi elephant can therefore be used more offensively than the xiangqi elephant. An elephant can be transposed with an adjacent horse in the initial setup.

====Chariots====

These are labelled &quot;cha&quot; 차 (). Like the rook in Western chess, the chariot moves and captures in a straight line either horizontally or vertically. Additionally, the chariot may move along the diagonal lines inside either palace, but only in a straight line. The two chariots begin the game in the corners. The chariot is the most powerful piece in the game.

====Cannons====

These are labelled &quot;po&quot; 포 (). Each player has two cannons. The cannons are placed on the row behind the soldiers, directly in front of the horses (if the horses are put on the file next to the chariots). The cannon moves by jumping another piece horizontally or vertically. The jump can be performed over any distance provided that there is exactly one piece anywhere between the original position and the target. To capture a piece, there must be exactly one piece (friendly or otherwise) between the cannon and the piece to be captured. The cannon then moves to that point and captures the piece. They may also move or capture diagonally along the diagonal lines in either palace, provided there is an intervening piece in the centre (i.e. it can only happen if the cannon is at a corner of the palace) They are powerful at the beginning of the game when &quot;hurdles&quot; are plentiful, but lose value rapidly with attrition. The other piece over which the cannon jumps may not be another cannon, nor can a cannon capture another cannon. In the diagram below, the blue cannon can move to the blue circles but not to the red ones; it can also capture the red horse, but it cannot capture (nor be captured by) the red cannon in the other palace. The right red cannon cannot capture the blue chariot either. Unlike xiangqi, janggi requires cannons to jump to move, as well as capture. This means in the starting position, there are no valid moves available for the cannon.

====Soldiers====

These are labelled &quot;byeong&quot; 병 () (soldiers, general term for a soldier) for Red and &quot;jol&quot; 졸 () (also means soldiers, usually lowest ranking soldiers) for Blue. Each side has five soldiers, initially placed on alternating points, one row back from the edge of where the river would be in xiangqi. Unlike pawns in Western chess, they move and capture one point either straight forward or sideways (unlike xiangqi, where soldiers must cross the &quot;river&quot; to be able to move sideways.) There is no promotion; once they reach the end of the board they may only move sideways. Soldiers may also move one point diagonally forward along the diagonal lines of the enemy palace.

===Setting up===
In tournaments, the elder player, or higher ranked player, conceals a soldier from each side in their hands. The opponent selects a hand to determine their color. After that, Han places their pieces first, followed by Cho placing theirs. (The reason both sides are not placed simultaneously is because the positions of horse and elephant can be transposed, giving some strategical advantage to the player who places last.)

There are four or five possible setups. They are basically named after the relative position of elephant.




Traditionally, there is the fifth, Central Chariot Setup, which is no longer used in modern tournament rule in South Korea, but may be still found in casual games or in North Korea.

After the pieces are set up, Cho moves first.

===Ending the game===
The game is won by checkmating the opposing general. This is called &quot;weh-tong&quot; ().

In Western chess, stalemate is achieved when no legal moves are possible. However, stalemate effectively does not exist in janggi. The player must pass their turn when no legal moves are possible. If neither player can move legally, or if neither player can win because neither player has enough pieces, the game ends in a draw.

A player may decide to make a move such that their general faces the opponent&#x27;s general unobstructed (a condition called &quot;bikjang&quot; ). In this situation, the opponent can either call a draw, or make a move that breaks the condition. In many cases, the bikjang rule can be used to force the opponent to call a draw on a losing game, by forcing them to sacrifice a valuable piece to break the bikjang position. It may not apply in some games, and usually the players will consent on the validity of the rule before the game begins.

Check is announced by declaring &quot;janggun&quot; (), meaning &quot;general&quot;. Getting out of janggun is called meonggun, and one may declare &quot;meonggun&quot; while escaping from janggun. But it is not necessary to say &quot;janggun&quot; out loud.

===Miscellaneous rules===
In South Korean tournaments, according to rules set by the Korean Janggi Association, there is no draw in any form, including draw by perpetual check or repetition of position. If a position repeats three times, a referee is called to determine who is at fault. Usually the referee orders the player who is losing to make a different move, so the player who is winning can press for an advantage. Sometimes it is not technically clear who is to blame, and different referees may differ as to which player must deviate, or whether repetition is mutually forced. This rule is applied because a winner and a loser must be decided during the game. If both players have less than 30 piece points, however, a draw is allowed by both repetition and perpetual check.

In tournaments where draws are not allowed, draws are resolved by adding up the points of their pieces that are still on the board.

Because the player with the blue pieces (&quot;cho&quot;) starts, they have an advantage. To compensate for this, Red receives 1.5 points (called &#x27;deom&#x27; () in Korean), the half-point being to avoid ties. So when the game starts, Blue has 72 points and Red has 73.5 points. If neither side can force a win, the player with the most points is declared the winner.

==In South Korean culture==

In South Korea one will often see older men crowding around a single janggi board while two men play for small amounts of money. These games are played year round, especially in city parks in Seoul. Janggi is occasionally played as a gambling game, and it is currently less popular in South Korea than the strategy game baduk (known in the West as go).

The Korea Janggi Association is responsible for promoting janggi in South Korea.

==Westernized variant==

Similar to European Xiangqi, the same is possible for Janggi, with a board of 9 × 10 cells.

<doc id="582393" wikidata="Q120939" url="?curid=582393" title="Polygynandry">
<text>Polygynandry is a mating system in which both males and females have multiple mating partners during a breeding season. In sexually reproducing diploid animals, different mating strategies are employed by males and females, because the cost of gamete production is lower for males than it is for females. The different mating tactics employed by males and females are thought to be the outcome of stochastic reproductive conflicts both ecologically and socially.

Reproductive conflicts in animal societies may arise because individuals are not genetically identical and have different optimal strategies for maximizing their fitness; and often it is found that reproductive conflicts generally arise due to dominance hierarchy in which all or a major part of reproduction is monopolized by only one individual. In the wasp &quot;Polistes carolina&quot;, the dominant queen amongst female wasps is determined by whoever arrives at the nest first rather than the largest foundress, who is expected to be the best at fighting (wasp). In a study of the bird &quot;Prunella collaris&quot;, the close proximity and sharing of ranges on the mountain tops of the French Pyrenees led to a polygynandrous mating system, where two to four males would mate with a range of two to four females within the same vicinity.

Polygynandry is another way to describe a multi-male and multi-female polygamous mating system. When females have multiple mating partners, it is known as polyandry, and when males have multiple mating partners, it is known as polygyny. Each sex has potential benefits in being promiscuous; females, especially those with genetically &#x27;inferior&#x27; social partners, have the chance to increase the genetic quality of their offspring, while males are able to fertilize the eggs of many other mates. Essentially, the ideal mating behavior for males is to be promiscuous rather than monogamous (when they only have one mating partner), because this leads to multiple offspring, and these males monopolize their female partners by physically preventing them from copulating with other males. On the other hand, females benefit through polyandry, as they have more sired offspring.

== Benefits of multiple mating in females ==

Oftentimes, females mate voluntarily with more than one male. Mating with several males reduces the risk of females having unfertilized eggs because one male may not have enough sperm to fertilize all her eggs. In dark-eyed juncos, a female mates with more than one male because oftentimes, her social partner is of lower genetic quality than other potential sperm donors. The females voluntarily mate with other males besides their mate because she sees the potential to improve her offspring viability and sexual attractiveness. Females may also mate with several males for genetic benefits such as genetic diversity among her offspring due to the variety of sperm available to her. In song birds, extra-pair matings occur because females are able to sneak away from their home territories to solicit to other males. When female song birds seek extra-male partners, they sexually select males with colorful plumage more elaborate than those of their social partner. Studies show that female song birds that have less plumage partners most actively seek extra-pair matings, furthermore males with the most developed traits—such as longer tails or brighter plumage survive better. Thus, when female song birds have multiple mating partners, they are increasing the genetic quality of their offspring.

To a female, multiple mating means an increase number of young that a female can produce, and oftentimes this also means an increase number of young they have to take care of. In order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of her offspring, females may have multiple mating partners in order to gain more resources from males for herself and her offspring. In dark-eyed juncos, dunnocks, and Galapagos hawks, mating with multiple males increases the amount of care a female can gain for her offspring. Oftentimes multiple mates allow females to have more sired offspring and the paternity of the offspring typically falls outside of the biological parents—meaning a different male may look after another male&#x27;s offspring.

== Benefits of multiple mating in males ==
Males can potentially fertilize eggs at a much faster rate than females can produce them, meaning a male can best increase his reproductive success by finding and fertilizing as many different females as possible. In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the reproductive success of males increased with the number of matings, but for females there was no direct relationship with number of mates and number of offspring produced. When males have multiple mating partners, they sometimes have to share parentage of the offspring, reducing the genetic value of the offspring to him and thus reduces the relative benefit of staying to help. When paternity is shared between multiple males, males are expected to be less likely to stay in order to help the female care for the offspring because there is little benefit in staying to help raise the other offspring when there are other males present.

Although males are able to increase their reproductive success faster than females by being able to fertilize eggs faster than females can produce them, males also at a disadvantage when it comes to mating because of sexual selection. Females usually choose males that are &#x27;charming&#x27; and those who display sexual ornaments. In a study of long-tailed widowbirds, males with longer tails were sexually selected over those with shorter and less impressive tails. In birds such as the red-collared widowbird, males who display their sexual ornament during courtship are generally paired up faster and attract more females than males who display shorter tails during courtship. Males are often sexually selected based on their physical characteristics and what they have to &#x27;offer&#x27;, for example, male peacocks with flamboyant colored tails are sexually selected over those with dull and less elaborate tails. Sexual selection of males by females also leads to male-male competition. Unlike females who invest a lot prior to mating, males do not invest as much when generating their sperm, however this increases competition amongst males for female investment. High mating competition also means a greater variance in male success—the best competitors will have better success in mating than those who fail to mate. The best competitors will less likely be inclined to care for their offspring upon mating because they have the ability to produce offspring elsewhere. Males with the greatest size, strength, or best developed weapons achieve the greatest mating success. In other cases, males may have a higher reproductive success if they have better access to resources than other competitors. For instance, female hanging flies mate with a male only if he provides a large insect for her to eat during copulation and North American bullfrogs protect ponds and small lakes where females come to lay their eggs.

=== Amphibia ===
The various mating tactics are found in a broad number of taxa. In amphibians such as &quot;Salamandrina perspicillata&quot;, multiple paternity is a consequence of females mating with multiple males. As of now, all species in the suborder Salamandroidea have shown to employ polyandrous mating strategies by females. In a study of a population of &quot;Salamandrina perspicillata&quot;, multiple paternity occurs as a pervasive reproductive strategy under natural conditions and it is seen that in these species, when males mated with two females, they sired offspring who were inversely related with their genetic similarity to the female. Females in this species practiced polygynandry in order to increase genetic variability among her offspring by choosing mates that were genetically different from themselves. Unlike other studies of polygynandry where the females had multiple mating partners in order to gain resources from the male, in the study of &quot;Salamandrina perspicillata&quot;, multiple paternity did not provide a genetic indirect benefit to the offspring. This, resulted in a cost/benefit mechanism in which the gained benefit of multiple mating counterbalanced the negative effect of the number of mates on offspring heterozygosity. Females choosing mates that are genetically different from themselves were also seen in &quot;Ichthyosaura alpestris&quot; and &quot;Lissotriton vulgaris&quot;, where in a two-male mating system, the less-related males were preferred by the females. And like the case of &quot;Salamandrina perspicillata&quot;, there were no indirect genetic benefits gained from having multiple mating partners.

=== Pycnogonids (sea spider) ===
In &quot;Ammothea hilgendorfi&quot;, a sea spider species, fertilization occurs as a female transfers her eggs to a male who holds them with ovigers, a specialized pair of legs and fertilizes the eggs externally. The males glue the eggs into clusters and carries the eggs on his ovigers until they hatch. The personal cost to males for providing a prolonged care for the young is seen to be a significant parental investment because parental assurance is thought to be substantial for post-zygotic investment. A high level of paternity assurance is &quot;Ammothea hilgendorfi&quot;, suggests that reduced foraging ability, increased predation risk, and lower mobility exist. An experimental study of &quot;Ammothea hilgendorfi&quot; showed that although males mate with multiple females, males do not mix egg batches from different dams. The eggs held in clusters by a male hatched in a close time frame, indicating that males mated with different females within a short time span.

Multiple mating by female pycnogonids are possible since a recently mated female often retains unused mature eggs in one or more femora, which allows her to mate with additional partners. In species with external fertilization and male parental care, females are able to distribute her clutch amongst different males and by doing so the female increases the likelihood that at least some of her offspring will receive indirect genetic benefits and/or extensive parental care from a quality provider.

=== Hymenoptera ===

The reproductive females of social Hymenoptera—wasps, bees, and ants—mate with multiple partners. These females are called queens, to distinguish them from the non-reprodutive females that tend the colony and do not mate.

A honey bee queen ideally mates with about a dozen drones (males) in her nuptial flight. The sperm of matings are stored in a special reservoir, called the spermatheca, for the life of the queen—which can be several years.

== Maintenance ==
Although promiscuity is said to benefit both males and females, there has not yet been sufficient data to support the fact that promiscuity benefits females. In a study of dark-eyed juncos, the offspring produced by extra-pair males were neither better nor worse than the offspring of their male social partners. However, the study of dark-eyed juncos did reveal more sired offspring in promiscuous females than monogamous females. In a study of female water striders, the results showed that multiple matings can become costly to the female—especially since a lot of time and energy is invested in producing an egg. Not only were extra matings costly, but there was no support for any genetic benefits from having multiple mating partners. Instead, the results from the experiment showed that egg production and egg hatching success were the highest when the number of partners were kept at a minimum.

On the other hand, studies have shown that males have had a higher reproductive success than females when they were polygynandrous. When compared to female chimpanzees, male chimpanzees had a better ratio of number of matings and number of offspring produced. Not only did studies show a higher reproductive success, but Columbian ground squirrels exhibited a significant male-biased sexual size and body mass, suggesting male-male competition. Male-male competition means sexual dimorphism amongst the males and this means females are able to sexually select males based on the sexual ornaments they display.

Overall, studies have shown that polygynandry benefits males more than it benefits females. When polygynandry is observed in different species, males most often have the upper hand—meaning males benefit more from polygynandry than do females. Females generally seek multiple mating partners in order to increase benefits for their offspring, whether it be by gaining physical resources for their offspring or by providing their offspring with healthier genes that are fit for survival. On the other hand, in most cases males generally have multiple mating partners in order to obtain as much offspring as they can during their lifespan and they are able to achieve this easier than females because in most cases, males are not parentally involved in caring and raising their offspring.

<text>Mark Jonathan Pincus (born February 13, 1966) is an American Internet entrepreneur known as the founder of Zynga, a mobile social gaming company. Pincus also founded the startups Freeloader, Inc., Tribe Networks, and Support.com. Pincus was the CEO of Zynga until July 2013, then again from 2015 to 2016.

Pincus was named 2009 &quot;CEO of the Year&quot; at The Crunchies technology awards and a year later was named Founder of the Year at the 2010 ceremony. Zynga is considered to be the pioneer of the social gaming industry. In 2011, Zynga went public with a $1 billion initial public offering. Pincus co-founded Reinvent Capital in 2018, an investment firm, with Reid Hoffman and hedge fund manager Michael Thompson. He co-created the Stanford Graduate School of Business course on Product Management with Professor Amir Goldberg.

==Early life and education==
Pincus&#x27; family lives in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. He is the son of Donna (née Forman) and Theodore Pincus, and is Jewish. His father was a business columnist and public relations adviser to CEOs and politicians, and his mother was an artist and architect.

Pincus attended Francis W. Parker School from kindergarten through 12th grade and graduated in 1984. He graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania earned in 1988 and an MBA from Harvard Business School, where he founded the Communications Club with Sherry Coutu.

==Career==

=== Financial services ===
Before he became an entrepreneur, Pincus worked in venture capital and financial services for six years. After graduating from Wharton, Pincus spent two years working as an analyst in the New Media Group at Lazard Freres &amp; Co. After that time, he moved to Hong Kong, where he was a Vice President for Asian Capital Partners for two years.

He returned to the United States in order to attend Harvard Business School (HBS) where he was a contemporary of Chris Hohn, Guy Spier and Chris Shumway. He graduated in 1993 and also spent a summer as an associate for Bain &amp; Co. in 1992.

After Pincus graduated from Harvard Business School, he took a job as a manager of corporate development at Tele-Communications, Inc., which is now AT&amp;T Cable. A year later, he joined Columbia Capital as vice president, where he led investments in new media and software startups in Washington, D.C. for a year.

=== Entrepreneur ===

==== Freeloader ====
In 1995, Pincus founded his first startup, Freeloader, Inc. Freeloader was backed by Fred Wilson and Softbank. The company was acquired seven months after its launch by Individual, Inc., for $38 million. Sean Parker worked as a summer intern at Freeloader when he was 14 years old. He later went on to co-found Napster, and Pincus became Napster&#x27;s first investor with an investment of $100,000.

==== Support.com ====
He then started his second company, Support.com, in August 1997. As Chairman and CEO, Pincus built the company into a leading provider of help desk automation software. The company went public in July 2000 at a $1.5 billion valuation. In 2002, the company changed its name from Support.com to SupportSoft, Inc.

==== Tribe.net ====
In 2003, at age 37, Pincus founded his third startup, Tribe.net, an early social network. Tribe.net partnered with major local newspapers and was backed by The Washington Post, Knight Ridder Digital, and Mayfield Fund and Guy Spier. In 2007, Cisco Systems acquired the core technology of Tribe.net to develop a social networking platform for its digital media services group.

In 2003, Pincus and Reid Hoffman purchased the Six Degrees patent, a broad, sweeping patent that describes a social network service that is the heart of social networks from the extinct Sixdegrees.com company for $700,000. Pincus and Hoffman stated at the time that their objective in buying the patent was to protect innovation in social networking and to prevent large companies from interfering with this. Pincus and Hoffman never enforced the patent.

==== Investing ====
Pincus was a founding investor in Napster, Facebook, Friendster, Snapchat, Xiaomi and Twitter. He was also an early investor in JD.com, Brightmail (later acquired by Symantec for $400m), and Buddy Media (acquired by Salesforce for $800m). In 2015, Pincus invested in the nootropics company HVMN (formerly Nootrobox), man-made diamond company Diamond Foundry, and in 2014 automated investment service firm Wealthfront.

==== Zynga ====
In July 2007 Pincus founded his fourth company, Zynga Inc., named after his deceased American bulldog Zinga. Zynga developed games on top of social networks such as Facebook, Myspace, and Bebo.

In 2011, Pincus took the company public with a $1 billion IPO. Pincus was CEO of the company from 2007 to 2013. On July 1, 2013, Zynga recruited Don Mattrick, the former president of Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft, was to succeed Pincus as CEO. Pincus remained actively involved in the company as Chairman of the Board and Chief Product Officer, but stepped down from his role as chief product officer to focus on his role as chairman of the board, the company announced in April 2014.

Pincus returned to the role of CEO of Zynga in April 2015. On March 7, 2016, Pincus stepped down as CEO, but continued his association with Zynga as Executive Chairman of the Board with Frank Gibeau in the role of CEO. In 2018, citing his confidence in Zynga&#x27;s management, Pincus voluntarily reduced his voting rights in the company from 70% to 10% and stepped back to a non-executive chairman role&quot;.&quot;

=== Start-ups ===
In 2014 Pincus started Superlabs, an incubator to develop products. Zynga acquired Superlabs in 2015.

In 2017, Pincus, alongside Reid Hoffman and Adam Werbach, launched Win the Future, a movement within the Democratic Party.

=== Reinvent Capital and SPACs ===
In 2018, with Reid Hoffman and Michael Thompson, Pincus co-founded Reinvent Capital, an investment firm that invests in internet, software, and media companies. Reinvent Capital has made investments in Zipline, goPuff, Dataminr, Nimble Robotics, Oscar Health, Lyft, all.Health, Convoy, SpaceX, and Aurora Innovation.

In September 2020, Reinvent launched Reinvent Technology Partners (RTP), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $690 million in its IPO. In February 2021, RTP announced a merger with electronic vertical take-off and landing aircraft pioneer Joby Aviation, valuing the company at $5 billion. Other investors included Uber Technologies, The Baupost Group, BlackRock, Fidelity Management &amp; Research, and Baillie Gifford.

In November 2020, the group launched its second SPAC, Reinvent Technology Partners Z, which raised $230 million in its IPO. In March 2021, RTPZ announced a merger with insurance technology company Hippo Insurance. Hippo provides home insurance in the United States, and uses artificial intelligence and big data to aggregate and analyze property information.

In February 2021, Pincus and Reinvent partners announced its third SPAC, Reinvent Technology Partners Y, raising $977.5 million in its IPO. In July 2021, RTPY announced a plan to merge with Pittsburgh-based Aurora Innovation, which is developing Level 4 self-driving technology for trucks and passenger vehicles.

== Philanthropy and community service ==
=== Presidio Trust ===
Pincus is a former member of the board of the Presidio Trust, a federal agency that operates and maintains the Presidio as part of the Golden Gate Recreation Area. He was appointed to the board by President Obama in 2017.

=== Zynga.org ===
In October 2009, Pincus started Zynga.org, which is &quot;committed to transforming the world through virtual social goods.&quot; Zynga.org has since raised more than $20 million for more than 50 international nonprofits by occasionally selling virtual goods for charitable causes. During his time at Zynga Pincus created features for several gaming sites that allowed players to donate to the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA); two organizations in Haiti, FATEM and Fonkoze, raising $427,000 in less than three weeks in October 2009. In January 2010 Zynga.org had raised $1.5 million in five days for Haiti Earthquake relief. The money was distributed within just two days. The total Zynga.org raised during 2010 for earthquake relief in Haiti was $3 million. In 2011 they raised an additional $2 million for rescue efforts in Japan after the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country.

On March 11, 2011, Zynga announced that 100 percent of the proceeds from the purchase of virtual goods from more than seven of its games would go toward Japan&#x27;s Save the Children Earthquake Emergency Fund. During the 2012 holiday season, Zynga.org partnered with Toys for Tots in its largest charitable campaign not related to disaster relief. The campaign raised $745,000, with 100 percent of the purchase price of certain virtual goods going to Toys for Tots.

In 2014, Zynga raised $1 million for Water.org, a Kansas City, Missouri-based charity that funds clean water projects in developing countries.

=== Zynga match ===
Zynga announced in June 2020 that they created a $25 million fund to invest in charitable causes and educational organizations that promote diversity and inclusion.

=== Oakland Undivided Campaign ===
In May 2020, Pincus donated $700,000 to the Oakland Unified School District and City of Oakland to help meet their $12.5 million goal towards eliminating the prevalent digital gap that exists in Oakland.

=== Roden Crater Project ===
In February 2020, Pincus donated $3 million to Roden Crater, a large scale Land artwork by James Turrell within a dormant volcano in the Painted Desert region of Northern Arizona. The contributions bring the project closer to completion which the artist hopes to open within the next five years.

=== Bolinas COVID-19 testing ===
In April 2020, Pincus, Finnish entrepreneur Jyri Engeström and biotech executive Cyrus Harmon, organized and financed community-wide COVID-19 testing in their hometown of Bolinas, California.  It was one of the first cases of community-wide testing in the US. Through their efforts Bolinas was able to test every one of its 1,600 residents for COVID-19 for free. Pincus donated the first $100,000 for the initiative, since it was not covered by government funds.

=== Canal Alliance ===
Pincus donated over $100,000 to Canal Alliance in June 2020. Canal Alliance works to provide relief from COVID-19 to families in need.

== Political views ==
Pincus describes his views as libertarian. He co-hosted a fundraiser for Kamala Harris&#x27;s 2016 Senate campaign and in 2020, along with many other Silicon Valley tech billionaires, gave the legal maximum dollar amount to support Joe Biden’s presidential campaign. In July 2024, Pincus wrote that &quot;Biden looks even riskier than Trump,&quot; disagreed with calls for Harris to replace Biden on the Democratic ticket, and praised aspects of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency.

==Personal life==

In 2008, Pincus married Alison Gelb, who founded One Kings Lane, a furniture and home accessories sales website that was sold to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in 2016. They have three children, twin girls and a boy, and live in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. In March 2017, the couple divorced.

Pincus spends his time away from work with his daughters, cycling, surfing, playing soccer and doing yoga.

He joined The Giving Pledge in 2022, committing to donating most of his wealth.

<text>Ernestine Louise Rose (January 13, 1810 – August 4, 1892) was a suffragist, abolitionist, and freethinker who has been called the “first Jewish feminist.” Her career spanned from the 1830s to the 1870s, making her a contemporary to the more famous suffragists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Largely forgotten in contemporary discussions of the American women&#x27;s rights movement, she was one of its major intellectual forces in nineteenth-century America. The quote, &quot;women&#x27;s rights are human rights,&quot; was believed to be first coined by her. Her relationship with Judaism is a debated motivation for her advocacy. As a rabbi&#x27;s daughter, Ernestine had received more education than other women her age. Although less well remembered than her fellow suffragists and abolitionists, in 1996, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, and in 1998 the Ernestine Rose Society was founded to “revive the legacy of this important early nineteenth century reformer by recognizing her pioneering role in the first wave of feminism.”

==Early life==
She was born on 13 January 1810 in Piotrków Trybunalski, Duchy of Warsaw, as Ernestine Louise Potowska. Her father was a wealthy rabbi. Unusual for the time, she was educated and learned Hebrew. There is no information about her mother. At the age of five, Rose began to &quot;question the justice of a God who would exact such hardships&quot; as the frequent fasts that her father performed. &quot;I was a rebel at the age of five.&quot; As she grew older, she began to question her father more and more on religious matters. He told her, &quot;A young girl does not want to understand the object of her creed, but to accept and believe it.&quot; She later said that she dated her disbelief and women&#x27;s rights principles from that event.

When she was sixteen her mother died and left her an inheritance. Her father, without her consent, betrothed her to a Jewish friend of his, to &quot;bind her more closely to the bosom of the synagogue.&quot; Rose, not wanting to enter a marriage with a man she neither chose nor loved, confronted him, professing her lack of affection towards him and begging for release. However, Rose was a woman from a rich family, and he denied her plea. In a highly unusual move, Rose traveled to the secular civil court — a difficult trip in winter — where she pleaded her case herself. The court ruled in her favor, not only freeing her from her betrothal, but ruling that she could retain the full inheritance she received from her mother. Although she decided to relinquish the fortune to her father, she gladly took her freedom from betrothal. She returned home only to discover that in her absence her father had remarried, to a sixteen-year-old girl. The tension that developed eventually forced her to leave home at the age of seventeen.

Rose then traveled to Berlin, where she found herself hampered by an antisemitic law that required all non-Prussian Jews to have a Prussian sponsor. She appealed directly to the king and was granted an exemption from the rule. Soon afterward, she invented perfumed paper for use as a room deodorizer, which she sold to fund her travels.

==England and the United States==
She traveled to Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and finally England. Her arrival in England was less than smooth, however, as the ship in which she was sailing was shipwrecked. Although Rose did make it to England safely, all her possessions had been destroyed, and she found herself destitute. In order to support herself, she sought work teaching German and Hebrew; she also continued to sell her perfumed paper. While in England, she met Robert Owen, a Utopian socialist, who was so impressed by her that he invited her to speak in a large hall for radical speakers. In spite of her limited knowledge of English, the audience was so impressed that from then on her appearances were regular. She and Owen were close friends, and she even helped him to found the Association of All Classes of All Nations, a group that espoused human rights for all people of all nations, sexes, races, and classes. He called her &quot;his daughter.&quot; During her time there she also met William Ella Rose, a Christian jeweler and silversmith, an Englishman, and a &quot;fervent disciple&quot; of Owen. They were soon married by a civil magistrate, and both made it plain that they considered the marriage a civil contract rather than a religious one.

In May 1836 the Roses emigrated to the United States, where they later became naturalized citizens and settled in a house in New York City in 1837. The Roses soon opened a small &quot;Fancy and Perfumery&quot; store in their home, where Rose sold her perfumed toilet water and William ran a silversmith shop.

==Abolitionist, atheist, feminist, suffragist==

Rose soon began to give lectures on the subjects that most interested her, joining the &quot;Society for Moral Philanthropists&quot; and traveling to different states to espouse her causes: the abolition of slavery, religious tolerance, public education, and equality for women. Her lectures were met with controversy. When she was in the South to speak out against slavery, one slaveholder told her he would have &quot;tarred and feathered her if she had been a man.&quot; When, in 1855, she was invited to deliver an anti-slavery lecture in Bangor, Maine, a local newspaper called her &quot;a female Atheist... a thousand times below a prostitute.&quot; When Rose responded to the slur in a letter to the competing paper, she sparked off a town feud that created such publicity that, by the time she arrived, everyone in town was eager to hear her. Her most ill-received lecture was likely in Charleston, West Virginia, where her lecture on the evils of slavery was met with such vehement opposition and outrage that she was forced to exercise considerable influence to get out of the city safely.

In the 1840s and 1850s, Rose joined the &quot;pantheon of great American women,&quot; a group that included such influential women as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis, and Sojourner Truth, along with William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass, to fight for women&#x27;s rights and abolition. 

In the winter of 1836, Judge Thomas Hertell submitted a married women&#x27;s property act to the New York State Legislature to investigate methods of improving the civil and property rights of married women, and to allow them to hold real estate in their own name. When Rose heard of this resolution, she drew up a petition and began to solicit names in support of it. In 1838, this petition was sent to the state legislature in spite of having five signatures. This was the first petition ever introduced in favor of rights for women. During the following years, she increased both the number of petitions and the number of signatures. In 1849, these rights were finally won.

Rose also attended and spoke at numerous conferences and conventions, including, but not limited to the First National Convention of Infidels, the Hartford Bible Convention, the Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in the Tabernacle, New York City, the tenth national convention of the National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Cooper Institute, New York City, the State Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Albany, New York, and the Equal Rights Association meeting in which there was a schism.

Rose was elected president of the National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in October, 1854, in spite of objections that she was an atheist. Her election was heavily supported by Susan B. Anthony, who declared that &quot;every religion – or none – should have an equal right on the platform.&quot;

Although she never seemed to attach great importance to her Jewish background, in 1863 Rose had a published debate with Horace Seaver, the abolitionist editor of the &quot;Boston Investigator&quot;, whom she accused of being antisemitic.

In 1869, she successfully lobbied for legislation in New York that allowed married women to retain their own property and have equal guardianship of children.

In her later years, after a six-month trip to Europe, she attempted to stay away from platforms and controversy. However, within 6 months, she made the closing address at the nationwide Women&#x27;s Rights Convention. Her health once again took a downward turn, and on June 8, 1869, she and her husband set sail for England. Susan B. Anthony arranged a farewell party for them, and the couple received many gifts from friends and admirers, including a substantial amount of money.

After 1873, her health improved, and she began to advocate women&#x27;s suffrage in England, even attending the Conference of the Woman&#x27;s Suffrage Movement in London and speaking in Edinburgh, Scotland at a large public meeting in favor of woman&#x27;s suffrage. She died in Brighton, England, in 1892 and was buried at Highgate Cemetery.

<doc id="582398" wikidata="Q1466657" url="?curid=582398" title="9 to 5 (film)">
<text>9to5 (titled Nine to Five in the opening credits) is a 1980 American comedy film directed by Colin Higgins, who wrote the screenplay with Patricia Resnick, and starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, Dabney Coleman, Elizabeth Wilson, and Sterling Hayden. It tells the story of three working women who live out their fantasies of getting even with and overthrowing their company&#x27;s autocratic, &quot;sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot&quot; vice president.

The film grossed over $103.9 million. As a star vehicle for Parton—already established as a successful musician—it launched her permanently into mainstream popular culture. A television series based on the film ran for five seasons in the 1980s, and a musical stage adaptation with new songs written by Parton opened on Broadway in 2009.

&quot;9 to 5&quot; is 74th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot; and has a 69% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The film is considered a cult classic.

==Plot==

Reserved housewife Judy Bernly must start work as a secretary at Consolidated Companies after her divorce, and is placed under the supervision of experienced and sharp-tongued widow Violet Newstead. Both work under egotistical, sexist vice president Franklin Hart, whom Violet once trained and who encourages the rumor that he and his attractive married secretary, Doralee Rhodes, are having an affair.

When Hart turns down Violet for a promotion in favor of Bob Enright who is below her, she reveals to Doralee the rumor about the affair, leading both women to take the afternoon off drinking at a local bar. Judy joins them after learning of Hart&#x27;s dismissal of Maria Delgado after his loyal administrative assistant Roz told him about her derisive comments.

Unable to think of a way to improve their situation, they spend the evening smoking marijuana at Doralee&#x27;s house and fantasizing about how they would get revenge on Hart: Judy would shoot him like a hunter does a deer, Doralee would hog tie him and roast him over a slow fire, and Violet would poison his coffee.

The next day, a frustrated and distracted Violet accidentally puts rat poison in Hart&#x27;s coffee, mistaking the box for the nearly identical box of sweetener. Before he can drink it, his desk chair malfunctions and he blacks out after hitting his head on a credenza.

Violet realizes her mistake and thinks the poisoned coffee caused Hart to black out. She and Judy meet Doralee at the hospital just in time to overhear a doctor pronounce another man dead from poisoning. Thinking the dead man is Hart, Violet steals the body to prevent an autopsy, but while arguing with Judy and Doralee, she crashes her car, damaging a fender. When Doralee retrieves a tire iron from the trunk to fix the fender, she discovers the body is not Hart so they return it to the hospital.

The next morning, Hart shocks the women when he arrives for work as usual. In the ladies room, Doralee explains that Hart hit his head, but did not drink the coffee. Relieved that nothing will come out of the night&#x27;s events, the ladies agree to meet for happy hour at the end of the day. However, Roz overhears their conversation and reports everything back to him.

Hart summons Doralee to his office and offers her a choice: if she spends the night with him, he will not report her, Judy, and Violet for attempted murder. Doralee refuses and when Hart will not hear her out, she hogties him and stuffs a scarf he had given her as a gift in his mouth to keep him quiet. He eventually tricks Judy into loosening the binds, which leads her to shoot at him with Doralee&#x27;s handgun.

Ultimately, the women discover Hart has been selling Consolidated inventory and pocketing the proceeds, so they blackmail him into keeping quiet. When they are told that invoices Violet ordered, that should prove Hart&#x27;s crimes, will not arrive for 4–6 weeks, they confine Hart to his bedroom wearing a hang gliding suit tied to a remote controlled garage door opener.

While Hart is out of the office, they implement several programs that are popular with the workers, including an in-office daycare center, equal pay for men and women, flexible hours, and a job-sharing program where employees can work part-time.

Days before the invoices arrive, Hart&#x27;s adoring wife, Missy, returns from a cruise and frees him, giving him the time to buy back the inventory he sold. Before Hart can report Judy, Doralee, and Violet to the police, the chairman of the board Russell Tinsworthy arrives to meet with Hart. He congratulates him on his improvements to the office which have resulted in a 20% increase in productivity. As a result, he invites Hart to join him on a multiyear project in Brazil which he reluctantly accepts. Violet, Judy, and Doralee celebrate their success as Roz comes in.

A postscript states that Violet is promoted to vice president, Judy marries the Xerox representative, and Doralee leaves Consolidated to become a country western singer. In the Brazilian jungle, Amazons abduct Hart, and he is &quot;never heard from again&quot;.

==Production==
The film was based on an idea by Jane Fonda, who had recently formed her own production company, IPC Films:

My ideas for films always come from things that I hear and perceive in my daily life ... A very old friend of mine had started an organization in Boston called &quot;Nine to Five&quot;, which was an association of women office workers. I heard them talking about their work and they had some great stories. And I&#x27;ve always been attracted to those 1940s films with three female stars.

Fonda said the film was at first going to be a drama, but &quot;any way we did it, it seemed too preachy, too much of a feminist line. I&#x27;d wanted to work with Lily [Tomlin] for some time, and it suddenly occurred to [her producing partner] Bruce and me that we should make it a comedy.&quot; Patricia Resnick wrote the first draft drama, and Fonda cast herself, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton in the leads, the last in her first film role.

Colin Higgins then came on board to direct and rewrite the script; part of his job was to make room for all three in the script. Higgins said Fonda was a very encouraging producer, who allowed him to push back production while the script was being rewritten. &quot;He&#x27;s a very nice, quiet, low-key guy&quot;, said Parton of Higgins. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I would have done if I&#x27;d had one of those mean directors on my first film.&quot; Higgins admitted &quot;he expected some tension&quot;, from working with three stars, &quot;but they were totally professional, great fun and a joy to work with. I just wish everything would be as easy.&quot;

Fonda stated that the resulting film &quot;remains a &#x27;labour film, but that she hoped it to be &quot;of a new kind, different from the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;. &quot;We took out a lot of stuff that was filmed, even stuff the director, Colin Higgins, thought worked but which I asked to have taken out. I&#x27;m just super-sensitive to anything that smacks of the soapbox or lecturing the audience&quot;.

Fonda said she did a lot of research, focusing on women who had begun work late in life due to divorce or being widowed.

What I found was that secretaries know the work they do is important, is skilled, but they also know they&#x27;re not treated with respect. They call themselves &quot;office wives&quot;. They have to put gas in the boss&#x27;s car, get his coffee, buy the presents for his wife and mistress. So when we came to do the film, we said to Colin [Higgins], OK, what you have to do is write a screenplay which shows you can run an office without a boss, but you can&#x27;t run an office without the secretaries!

===Filming locations===
The home of Franklin Hart is located at 10431 Bellagio Road in Bel Air, Los Angeles. According to commentary included in the DVD release of the film, the home was, at the time, owned by the Chandler family, publishers of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The Consolidated offices were presumably in the Pacific Financial Center located at 800 W 6th Street, at South Flower Street in Los Angeles. Although the story appears to be set in Los Angeles, the opening credit montage, set to the title song, is mostly composed of shots from downtown San Francisco. These shots include an electric MUNI bus fitted with a KFOG 104.5 FM advertisement, the Ferry Building clock, and a brief glimpse of the San Francisco twins, Marian and Vivian Brown.

==Soundtrack==
===Theme song===

The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;9 to 5&quot;, written and recorded by Parton, became one of her biggest hits of the decade. While filming the &quot;9 to 5&quot; movie, Parton found she could use her long acrylic fingernails to simulate the sound of a typewriter. She wrote the song on set by clicking her nails together and forming the beat. The song went to number one for two weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as the U.S. country singles charts, and was nominated for several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It won the 1981 People&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Favorite Motion Picture Song&quot;, and two 1982 Grammy Awards: for &quot;Country Song of the Year&quot; and &quot;Female Country Vocal of the Year&quot; (it was nominated for four Grammys). Additionally, it was certified platinum by the RIAA.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and called it &quot;pleasant entertainment, and I liked it, despite its uneven qualities and a plot that&#x27;s almost too preposterous for the material.&quot; Ebert singled out Dolly Parton as &quot;a natural-born movie star&quot; who &quot;contains so much energy, so much life and unstudied natural exuberance that watching her do anything in this movie is a pleasure.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was less enthusiastic, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s clearly a movie that began as someone&#x27;s bright idea, which then went into production before anyone had time to give it a well-defined personality.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and wrote, &quot;The most pleasant surprise is the appearance of Dolly Parton, who with this one film establishes herself as a thoroughly engaging movie star. The biggest disappointment is that this Jane Fonda comedy about a trio of secretaries out to get their boss doesn&#x27;t have more bite ... Instead of getting darker and darker, &#x27;Nine to Five&#x27; gets lighter and lighter until it loses most of the energy it established so well early on.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;Although it can probably be argued that Patricia Resnick and director Colin Higgins&#x27; script at times borders on the inane, the bottom line is that this picture is a lot of fun.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;appears to be an audience pleaser that never misses an intended laugh. However, it strays so far from reality for so long that it threatens to become mired in overly complicated silliness and to lose sight of the serious satirical points it wants to make. Happily, it does pull together for a finish that&#x27;s as strong as it is funny.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought the film &quot;runs a merely weak comic premise into the ground with coarse, laborious execution&quot;. He thought that Dolly Parton was the film&#x27;s &quot;only reassuring aspect&quot;, as she seemed &quot;an instantly likable natural on the movie screen, too&quot;. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; called the film &quot;a disappointment ... It&#x27;s not wild or dark enough to qualify as a truly disturbing farce and it&#x27;s too fanciful and silly to succeed as realistic satire. Politically and esthetically, it&#x27;s harmless—a mildly amusing romp that tends to get swallowed up by its own overly intricate plot.&quot;

Ronald Reagan wrote in his presidential diary that he and his wife Nancy watched the film on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1981. He wrote, &quot;Funny—but one scene made me mad. A truly funny scene if the 3 gals had played getting drunk but no they had to get stoned on pot. It was an endorsement of Pot smoking for any young person who sees the picture.&quot;

While the film received mixed reviews from critics during its initial theatrical release, it has since been reappraised for its commentary on workplace sexism and the gender pay gap. In a 2018 review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw wrote, &quot;Thirty-eight years on, this tale of misogyny, kidnap and rattling typewriters is a boldly progressive piece of film-making.&quot; The film&#x27;s cultural legacy, path to production, and impact on the women&#x27;s labor movement are explored in the 2022 documentary &quot;Still Working 9 to 5&quot;.

The film holds a score of 69% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 99 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;It might not be much of a way to make a living, but &quot;9 to 5&quot; is a wonderfully cast comedy that makes some sharp points about gender roles in the workplace.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 58 based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – No. 74
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;9 to 5&quot; – No. 78

==Legacy==
===Television series===

The film inspired a sitcom, which aired from 1982 to 1983 and from 1986 to 1988, on ABC (1982–83) and in first-run syndication (1986–88). It featured Parton&#x27;s younger sister, Rachel Dennison, in Parton&#x27;s role; with Rita Moreno and Valerie Curtin, respectively, took over Tomlin and Fonda&#x27;s roles. In the syndicated era, Sally Struthers replaced Moreno. A total of 85 episodes were filmed.

===Stage adaptation===

In an interview aired on September 30, 2005, on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Parton revealed that she was writing the songs for a musical stage adaptation of the film. A private reading of the musical took place on January 19, 2007. Further private presentations were held in New York City in summer 2007.

In early March 2008, Center Theatre Group artistic director Michael Ritchie announced that &quot;9 to 5&quot; would have its pre-Broadway run at the center&#x27;s Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles beginning September 21, 2008, with Allison Janney starring as Violet, joined by Stephanie J. Block as Judy, Megan Hilty as Doralee, and Marc Kudisch as Franklin Hart Jr. The libretto was written by Patricia Resnick, who co-authored the film. Andy Blankenbuehler choreographed the show, and Joe Mantello directed.

According to Playbill, the musical opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in previews on April 7, 2009, and officially on April 30, 2009. However, due to low ticket sales and gross, the production closed on September 6, 2009. A national tour began in September 2010.

===Possible sequel===

In the 1980s, Universal developed a sequel with Higgins. Tom Mankiewicz worked on it for a while and says that while Parton was enthusiastic, Fonda was not and Higgins&#x27; heart was not in it.

In a 2005 BBC One interview broadcast, Fonda, Tomlin, and Parton all expressed interest in a sequel. Fonda said if the right script was written she would definitely do it, suggesting a suitable name for a 21st-century sequel would be &quot;24/7&quot;. Parton suggested they had better hurry up before they reach retirement age. In the DVD commentary, the three reiterate their enthusiasm; Fonda suggests a sequel should cover outsourcing and they agree Hart would have to return as their nemesis.

In 2018, Parton announced that a sequel was in the works to bring the story into a modern-day setting. In July 2018, Jane Fonda also confirmed that a sequel was in the works with herself, Tomlin and Parton returning to their roles as mentors to a new generation of women. Fonda revealed that she is also an executive producer on the project. Rashida Jones and Pat Resnick have been attached to write a script. On October 23, 2018, Fonda reiterated news about the development of a sequel on &quot;GMA Day&quot;. On October 30, 2019, Parton announced the sequel had been dropped.

In 2022 though, all three actresses made a full reunion of the &quot;9 to 5&quot; cast, after Parton appeared in a guest starring role in the final episode of the Netflix comedy streaming TV series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;, which starred Fonda and Tomlin for seven seasons.

===Remake===
In April 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; revealed that Jennifer Aniston and her Echo Films partner Kristin Hahn are producing a &quot;9 to 5&quot; reimagining for 20th Century Studios.

<text>A beam splitter or beamsplitter is an optical device that splits a beam of light into a transmitted and a reflected beam. It is a crucial part of many optical experimental and measurement systems, such as interferometers, also finding widespread application in fibre optic telecommunications.

==Designs==
In its most common form, a cube, a beam splitter is made from two triangular glass prisms which are glued together at their base using polyester, epoxy, or urethane-based adhesives. (Before these synthetic resins, natural ones were used, e.g. Canada balsam.) The thickness of the resin layer is adjusted such that (for a certain wavelength) half of the light incident through one &quot;port&quot; (i.e., face of the cube) is reflected and the other half is transmitted due to FTIR (frustrated total internal reflection). Polarizing beam splitters, such as the Wollaston prism, use birefringent materials to split light into two beams of orthogonal polarization states.
Another design is the use of a half-silvered mirror. This is composed of an optical substrate, which is often a sheet of glass or plastic, with a partially transparent thin coating of metal. The thin coating can be aluminium deposited from aluminium vapor using a physical vapor deposition method. The thickness of the deposit is controlled so that part (typically half) of the light, which is incident at a 45-degree angle and not absorbed by the coating or substrate material, is transmitted and the remainder is reflected. A very thin half-silvered mirror used in photography is often called a pellicle mirror. To reduce loss of light due to absorption by the reflective coating, so-called &quot;Swiss-cheese&quot; beam-splitter mirrors have been used. Originally, these were sheets of highly polished metal perforated with holes to obtain the desired ratio of reflection to transmission. Later, metal was sputtered onto glass so as to form a discontinuous coating, or small areas of a continuous coating were removed by chemical or mechanical action to produce a very literally &quot;half-silvered&quot; surface.

Instead of a metallic coating, a dichroic optical coating may be used. Depending on its characteristics (thin-film interference), the ratio of reflection to transmission will vary as a function of the wavelength of the incident light. Dichroic mirrors are used in some ellipsoidal reflector spotlights to split off unwanted infrared (heat) radiation, and as output couplers in laser construction.

A third version of the beam splitter is a dichroic mirrored prism assembly which uses dichroic optical coatings to divide an incoming light beam into a number of spectrally distinct output beams. Such a device was used in three-pickup-tube color television cameras and the three-strip Technicolor movie camera. It is currently used in modern three-CCD cameras. An optically similar system is used in reverse as a beam-combiner in three-LCD projectors, in which light from three separate monochrome LCD displays is combined into a single full-color image for projection.

Beam splitters with single-mode fiber for PON networks use the single-mode behavior to split the beam. The splitter is done by physically splicing two fibers &quot;together&quot; as an X.

Arrangements of mirrors or prisms used as camera attachments to photograph stereoscopic image pairs with one lens and one exposure are sometimes called &quot;beam splitters&quot;, but that is a misnomer, as they are effectively a pair of periscopes redirecting rays of light which are already non-coincident. In some very uncommon attachments for stereoscopic photography, mirrors or prism blocks similar to beam splitters perform the opposite function, superimposing views of the subject from two different perspectives through color filters to allow the direct production of an anaglyph 3D image, or through rapidly alternating shutters to record sequential field 3D video.

==Phase shift==

Beam splitters are sometimes used to recombine beams of light, as in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. In this case there are two incoming beams, and potentially two outgoing beams. But the amplitudes of the two outgoing beams are the sums of the (complex) amplitudes calculated from each of the incoming beams, and it may result that one of the two outgoing beams has amplitude zero. In order for energy to be conserved (see next section), there must be a phase shift in at least one of the outgoing beams. For example (see red arrows in picture on the right), if a polarized light wave in air hits a dielectric  surface such as glass, and the electric field of the light wave is in the plane of the surface, then the reflected wave will have a phase shift of π, while the transmitted wave will not have a phase shift; the blue arrow does not pick up a phase-shift, because it is reflected from a medium with a lower refractive index. The behavior is dictated by the Fresnel equations.
This does not apply to partial reflection by conductive (metallic) coatings, where other phase shifts occur in all paths (reflected and transmitted). In any case, the details of the phase shifts depend on the type and geometry of the beam splitter.

==Classical lossless beam splitter==
For beam splitters with two incoming beams, using a classical, lossless beam splitter with electric fields &quot;Ea&quot; and &quot;Eb&quot; each incident at one of the inputs, the two output fields &quot;Ec&quot; and &quot;Ed&quot; are linearly related to the inputs through
:formula_1
where the 2×2 element formula_2 is the beam-splitter transfer matrix and &quot;r&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are the reflectance and transmittance along a particular path through the beam splitter, that path being indicated by the subscripts. (The values depend on the polarization of the light.)

If the beam splitter removes no energy from the light beams, the total output energy can be equated with the total input energy, reading
:formula_3
Inserting the results from the transfer equation above with formula_4 produces 
:formula_5
and similarly for then formula_6 
:formula_7
When both formula_8 and formula_9 are non-zero, and using these two results we obtain 
:formula_10
where &quot;formula_11&quot; indicates the complex conjugate. It is now easy to show that formula_12 where formula_13 is the identity, i.e. the beam-splitter transfer matrix is a unitary matrix.

Each &quot;r&quot; and &quot;t&quot; can be written as a complex number having an amplitude and phase factor; for instance, formula_14. The phase factor accounts for possible shifts in phase of a beam as it reflects or transmits at that surface. Then we obtain
:formula_15
Further simplifying, the relationship becomes
:formula_16
which is true when formula_17 and the exponential term reduces to -1. Applying this new condition and squaring both sides, it becomes
:formula_18
where substitutions of the form formula_19 were made. This leads to the result
:formula_20
and similarly,
:formula_21
It follows that formula_22.
Having determined the constraints describing a lossless beam splitter, the initial expression can be rewritten as
:formula_23

Applying different values for the amplitudes and phases can account for many different forms of the beam splitter that can be seen widely used. 

The transfer matrix appears to have 6 amplitude and phase parameters, but it also has 2 constraints: formula_22 and formula_17. To include the constraints and simplify to 4 independent parameters, we may write formula_26 (and from the constraint formula_27), so that

:formula_28
where formula_29 is the phase difference between the transmitted beams and similarly for formula_30, and formula_31 is a global phase.
Lastly using the other constraint that formula_22 we define formula_33
so that formula_34, hence

:formula_35

A 50:50 beam splitter is produced when formula_36. The dielectric beam splitter above, for example, has 
:formula_37
i.e. formula_38, while the &quot;symmetric&quot; beam splitter of Loudon has 
:formula_39
i.e. formula_40.

== Use in experiments ==
Beam splitters have been used in both thought experiments and real-world experiments in the area of quantum theory and relativity theory and other fields of physics. These include:
* The Fizeau experiment of 1851 to measure the speeds of light in water
* The Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 to measure the effect of the (hypothetical) luminiferous aether on the speed of light
* The Hammar experiment of 1935 to refute Dayton Miller&#x27;s claim of a positive result from repetitions of the Michelson-Morley experiment
* The Kennedy–Thorndike experiment of 1932 to test the independence of the speed of light and the velocity of the measuring apparatus
* Bell test experiments (from ca. 1972) to demonstrate consequences of quantum entanglement and exclude local hidden-variable theories
* Wheeler&#x27;s delayed choice experiment of 1978, 1984 etc., to test what makes a photon behave as a wave or a particle and when it happens
* The FELIX experiment (proposed in 2000) to test the Penrose interpretation that quantum superposition depends on spacetime curvature
* The Mach–Zehnder interferometer, used in various experiments, including the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester involving interaction-free measurement; and in others in the area of quantum computation

== Quantum mechanical description ==
In quantum mechanics, the electric fields are operators as explained by second quantization and Fock states. Each electrical field operator can further be expressed in terms of modes representing the wave behavior and amplitude operators, which are typically represented by the dimensionless creation and annihilation operators. In this theory, the four ports of the beam splitter are represented by a photon number state formula_41 and the action of a creation operation is formula_42. The following is a simplified version of Ref. The relation between the classical field amplitudes formula_43, and formula_44 produced by the beam splitter is translated into the same relation of the corresponding quantum creation (or annihilation) operators formula_45, and formula_46, so that

:formula_47
where the transfer matrix is given in classical lossless beam splitter section above:

:formula_48

Since formula_2 is unitary, formula_50, i.e.
:formula_51

This is equivalent to saying that if we start from the vacuum state formula_52 and add a photon in port &quot;a&quot; to produce 
:formula_53 
then the beam splitter creates a superposition on the outputs of 
:formula_54

The probabilities for the photon to exit at ports &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are therefore formula_55 and formula_56, as might be expected.
Likewise, for any input state formula_57 

:formula_58
and the output is
:formula_59

Using the multi-binomial theorem, this can be written
:formula_60
where formula_61 and the formula_62 is a binomial coefficient and it is to be understood that the coefficient is zero if formula_63 etc. 

The transmission/reflection coefficient factor in the last equation may be written in terms of the reduced parameters that ensure unitarity:

:formula_64
where it can be seen that if the beam splitter is 50:50 then formula_65 and the only factor that depends on &quot;j&quot; is the formula_66 term. This factor causes interesting interference cancellations. For example, if formula_67 and the beam splitter is 50:50, then
:formula_68 
where the formula_69 term has cancelled. Therefore the output states always have even numbers of photons in each arm. A famous example of this is the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect, in which the input has formula_70, the output is always formula_71 or formula_72, i.e. the probability of output with a photon in each mode (a coincidence event) is zero. Note that this is true for all types of 50:50 beam splitter irrespective of the details of the phases, and the photons need only be indistinguishable. This contrasts with the classical result, in which equal output in both arms for equal inputs on a 50:50 beam splitter does appear for specific beam splitter phases (e.g. a symmetric beam splitter formula_73), and for other phases where the output goes to one arm (e.g. the dielectric beam splitter formula_74) the output is always in the same arm, not random in either arm as is the case here. From the correspondence principle we might expect the quantum results to tend to the classical one in the limits of large &quot;n&quot;, but the appearance of large numbers of indistinguishable photons at the input is a non-classical state that does not correspond to a classical field pattern, which instead produces a statistical mixture of different formula_75 known as Poissonian light.

Rigorous derivation is given in the Fearn–Loudon 1987 paper and extended in Ref to include statistical mixtures with the density matrix.

=== Non-symmetric beam-splitter ===
In general, for a non-symmetric beam-splitter, namely a beam-splitter for which the transmission and reflection coefficients are not equal, one can define an angle formula_76 such that

formula_77

where formula_78 and formula_79 are the reflection and transmission coefficients. Then the unitary operation associated with the beam-splitter is then

formula_80

=== Application for quantum computing ===
In 2000 Knill, Laflamme and Milburn (KLM protocol) proved that it is possible to create a universal quantum computer solely with beam splitters, phase shifters, photodetectors and single photon sources. The states that form a qubit in this protocol are the one-photon states of two modes, i.e. the states |01⟩ and |10⟩ in the occupation number representation (Fock state) of two modes. Using these resources it is possible to implement any single qubit gate and 2-qubit probabilistic gates. The beam splitter is an essential component in this scheme since it is the only one that creates entanglement between the Fock states.

Similar settings exist for continuous-variable quantum information processing. In fact, it is possible to simulate arbitrary Gaussian (Bogoliubov) transformations of a quantum state of light by means of beam splitters, phase shifters and photodetectors, given two-mode squeezed vacuum states are available as a prior resource only (this setting hence shares certain similarities with a Gaussian counterpart of the KLM protocol). The building block of this simulation procedure is the fact that a beam splitter is equivalent to a squeezing transformation under &quot;partial&quot; time reversal.

==Diffractive beam splitter==
==Reflection beam splitters==

Reflection beam splitters reflect parts of the incident radiation in different directions. These partial beams show exactly the same intensity. Typically, reflection beam splitters are made of metal and have a broadband spectral characteristic.

Due to their compact design, beam splitters of this type are particularly easy to install in infrared detectors. At this application, the radiation enters through the aperture opening of the detector and is split into several beams of equal intensity but different directions by internal highly reflective microstructures. Each beam hits a sensor element with an upstream optical filter. Particularly in NDIR gas analysis, this design enables measurement with only one beam with a minimal beam cross-section, which significantly increases the interference immunity of the measurement.

<doc id="582420" wikidata="Q988626" url="?curid=582420" title="El Hadji Diouf">
<text>El Hadji Ousseynou Diouf (; born 15 January 1981) is a Senegalese former professional footballer. Throughout his career, Diouf played as a winger or a forward.

Having started his professional football career in France with Sochaux, Rennes and Lens, Diouf finalised a move to Premier League side Liverpool prior to the 2002 FIFA World Cup for Senegal and went on to have a memorable tournament. He has also played in England&#x27;s top flight for Bolton Wanderers, Sunderland and Blackburn Rovers before a stint in the Scottish Premier League with Rangers. In 2011, he joined Football League Championship side Doncaster Rovers but was released at the end of the 2011–12 season following the club&#x27;s relegation. He then moved to Leeds United where he spent two seasons. During his nine-year international career, he scored 21 goals in 69 caps, and also garnered considerable notoriety for a series of controversial incidents.

==Early life==
Born in Dakar, Senegal, Diouf came from a Serer background of the noble Diouf family.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Diouf started his career in France with Sochaux-Montbéliard. He made his debut appearance in a 2–1 win against Bastia on 12 November 1998, before moving to Rennes for the 1999–2000 season. He moved to Lens the following season, spending two years at the Pas-de-Calais.

===Liverpool===
In early June 2002 he was reportedly linked with the English club Liverpool who had also just signed his club and international compatriot Salif Diao. The news initially broke following his Man of The Match performance in the opening FIFA World Cup 2002 1-0 group game vs France, who were the defending World and European Champions and one of the favourites to win the 2002 tournament. Lens initially denied that the signing had been made, but it was finally confirmed on 2 June with an estimated price tag of £10m. His continued impressive performances in the World Cup for Senegal, where they reached the quarter-finals, led to much excitement prior to his arrival in England. Diouf was the striker that manager Gérard Houllier hoped would take the Premier League title from Arsenal, after Liverpool had finished in second place the previous season.

Diouf won praises for his early games for Liverpool including his first game at Anfield where he scored two goals, his first for the club, in a 3–0 win against Southampton on 24 August 2002. He started the 2003 Football League Cup Final as Liverpool defeated Manchester United.

Liverpool fans had to wait until March 2003 for Diouf&#x27;s next goal for Liverpool. That occurred in a 2–0 win against Bolton Wanderers, in a game where he scored once and provided the assist for the second. The next game saw Diouf play in a UEFA Cup match against Celtic at Parkhead which finished 1–1. The game marked a watershed in his career when, in the 87th minute, he spat at a Celtic fan, causing crowd disturbances and Diouf to be interviewed by the police. He received a two match ban and was fined two weeks wages with Liverpool making a donation of £60,000 to a Glasgow charity of Celtic&#x27;s choice.

Diouf failed to score for the remainder of the 2002–03 season or at all in the 2003–04 season which saw him pick up 13 yellow and one red card which came on 7 January 2004 when he was sent-off in a 1–0 away win against Chelsea for fouling Adrian Mutu. By then he had become unpopular due to both his attitude and his lack of goals. Jamie Carragher later said of him &quot;&quot;He has one of the worst strike rates of any forward in Liverpool history. He&#x27;s the only no. 9 ever to go through a whole season without scoring, in fact he&#x27;s probably the only no. 9 of any club to do that. He was always the last one to get picked in training&quot;.&quot; At the beginning of the 2004–05 season he was loaned to Bolton Wanderers. At the end of the season-long loan — and after scoring a mere six goals in 80 appearances with only three in the league — Diouf left Liverpool signing permanently for Bolton in the summer of 2005.

===Bolton Wanderers===
Bolton Wanderers bought Diouf from Liverpool for an undisclosed fee at the start of the 2005–06 season, after they had loaned the player for the 2004–05 season. On 15 September 2005, Diouf scored Bolton&#x27;s first ever goal in a European competition against Lokomotiv Plovdiv in a UEFA Cup match at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton went on to win the game 2–1. He was largely successful at Bolton and became a fans&#x27; favourite due to his flair and direct running. Diouf confirmed in an interview with the BBC that he would be leaving Bolton at the end of the 2007–08 season and that his goal against Sunderland on 3 May marked his last appearance at the Reebok Stadium.

===Sunderland===
Diouf signed for Sunderland on 28 July 2008, after Bolton agreed to a transfer fee of £2.63m. He signed a four-year contract at the Stadium of Light after undergoing a medical. Diouf said that he was happy to join Sunderland. Then-manager Roy Keane stated he was happy that Diouf had joined Sunderland saying: &quot;El Hadji has always been the kind of player opposition teams and supporters hate. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re delighted to now have him in our squad.&quot; Diouf made a promising start for Sunderland but failed to score in any of his sixteen appearances.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Diouf signed for Blackburn Rovers for a £2 million fee on 30 January 2009, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal after just six months at the Stadium of Light, rejoining former Bolton manager Sam Allardyce at the club. He was given the number 18 shirt and scored his first goal for the club against Fulham at Craven Cottage on 11 March 2009 in a 2–1 win. During the summer transfer window, Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce revealed that Diouf was acquired for £1 million. Diouf scored his first home goal for Rovers at Ewood Park in the club&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers on 12 September 2009. On 2 January 2010, he was sent off in a 3–1 defeat to Aston Villa in the third round of the FA Cup. On 21 March 2010, Diouf scored the equalising goal against Chelsea in a 1–1 draw at Ewood Park which opened up the 2010 title race. He started the next two Premier League games against Birmingham and Burnley; he then made his fortieth appearance for the club at Fratton Park playing against bottom-of-the-league side Portsmouth in a 0–0 draw on 3 April. By the end of the 2009–10 season, he had made 27 appearances, scoring three goals.

On 20 August 2011, Blackburn manager Steve Kean confirmed that Diouf was not in his first-team plans, and that he expected him to leave before the end of the 2011–12 transfer window. On 31 August 2011, Blackburn terminated Diouf&#x27;s contract by mutual consent. He had fallen out with manager Kean after returning late for pre-season training.

==== Loan to Rangers ====

On the last day of the 2011 January transfer window, Diouf joined Scottish Premier League champions Rangers on loan until the end of the 2010–11 season. He made his debut on 2 February, coming on as a 20th-minute substitute for injured teammate Lee McCulloch during a 1–0 win over Hearts at Ibrox. He made his first start for Rangers four days later in a 2–2 draw with Celtic in the Scottish Cup. Diouf scored his first goal for Rangers on 24 February in a 2–2 draw against Sporting CP in the Europa League, netting the opening goal of the game with a header in the 20th minute. He then scored his second goal for Rangers on 13 March in a Scottish Premier League match with Kilmarnock, again scoring the first goal as Rangers won 2–1. In March 2011 Diouf was part of the Rangers team that won the Scottish League Cup after a 2–1 win over rivals Celtic. Diouf also collected an SPL winners medal as Rangers performed a comeback from two points behind Celtic to win the league by one point.

===Doncaster Rovers===
In October 2011, Diouf was handed a trial by West Ham United and their manager, Sam Allardyce, his manager at both Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers. On 28 October it was announced that Diouf would not be joining the club because of a lack of fitness and his bad reputation. Allardyce later confirmed that the depth of feeling amongst fans was taken into account in his decision not to sign the player.

On 31 October 2011, Diouf signed for Doncaster Rovers on a three-month contract. He scored his first two goals for Doncaster against Ipswich at Portman Road on 5 November 2011, earning Man of the Match honours and a 3–2 victory. He took the captain&#x27;s armband in a goalless draw against Watford but a training injury meant he was unable to play the following games. On 2 February 2012, Diouf signed a six-month deal with the view to an extra year.

After Doncaster were relegated from The Championship, On 25 April 2012, Diouf was believed to have held talks with Leeds United with a view to signing him at the end of his Doncaster contract. Diouf claimed on 26 April he was very keen on moving to Leeds despite Leeds manager, Neil Warnock, having previously described him as &quot;lower than a sewer rat&quot; for an incident involving Jamie Mackie.

On 19 July 2012, it was announced that Diouf would not face charges for assault after being arrested following an incident in a Manchester nightclub in April.

===Leeds United===
On 9 August 2012, Diouf joined Leeds United on trial and started training with the first team. Diouf was confirmed to have signed a non-contract deal with Leeds United on 11 August. Diouf appeared as a substitute in the second half for Leeds against Shrewsbury Town in the League Cup on 11 August.

Diouf made his league début for Leeds as a first-half substitute in their 1–0 victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his first start for Leeds in their 2–1 victory over Peterborough United on 25 August.

On 1 September, Diouf scored his first goal for Leeds in a 3–3 draw against his former club Blackburn Rovers. After the match it was announced that Diouf had signed a permanent contract at Leeds until January 2013. Diouf revealed that he had turned down more lucrative offers from elsewhere to become &#x27;a legend&#x27; at Leeds by helping them reach the Premier League. Diouf put in an impressive performance for Leeds&#x27; 2–1 victory against Premiership side Everton on 25 September. After the match, manager Neil Warnock described Diouf as his &#x27;matador&#x27; and that Diouf had made promises to stay at the club beyond his initial six-month contract.

Diouf scored a brace against Bristol City to help earn Leeds a 3–2 victory on 29 September. Diouf was named captain against his old side Bolton Wanderers in a 2–2 draw on 2 October. Diouf scored his fourth goal of the season on 30 October in a 3–0 League Cup win against Premier League side Southampton F.C. to help Leeds advance to the quarter-finals of the competition. Diouf scored his milestone 5th goal of the season with a penalty to help earn Leeds a 2–2 draw against Brighton on 2 November.

On 14 December 2012, Diouf signed a new 18-month deal at the club taking him until the end of the 2013–14 season. He scored his 7th goal of the season against Brighton on 27 April, but received his first red card as a Leeds player for celebrating it with a rude &#x27;gesture&#x27; towards the Brighton fans.

In May 2013, after Guinea club AS Kaloum claimed to have signed Diouf, Leeds United and Diouf strenuously dismissed the claim as &#x27;complete rubbish,&#x27; stating that Diouf would be playing for Leeds in the 2013–14 season. Diouf was ruled out of the entire 2013–14 pre-season due to a shin infection.

On 15 August 2013, the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; reported that Diouf had been made available for transfer.

In December 2013, it was revealed that Diouf had missed several Leeds fixtures and training sessions due to unspecified &#x27;personal problems&#x27;, and in order to attend the funerals of former mentor and Senegal coach Bruno Metsu and former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela.

Diouf made his first start for Leeds in several months on 28 January in a 1–1 draw against Ipswich Town. It was to be his final game for the club. On 16 May 2014, Diouf was released.

===Sabah FA===
In November 2014, Diouf signed a one-year contract with Malaysian side Sabah FA of the Malaysia Premier League, and was named team captain. However, Diouf soon found himself embroiled in controversy with his new club after comparing it unfavourably with rival club Johor Darul Takzim II F.C. during an interview with Johor TV. Diouf was reported to have said that &quot;he is willing to build a JDT academy on his own land in Senegal and JDT will get the monetary returns from the proceed of selling players to European countries. He also said that he is willing to play for JDT without any money because of his love for the state of Johor as well as being impressed by the vision and mission of the club&quot;. Diouf said this was due to the lack of vision and mission by Sabah Football Association (SAFA). Deeming this behaviour &quot;unprofessional,&quot; Sabah stripped Diouf of the captaincy in July 2015.

==International career==
Diouf&#x27;s international career started in April 2000 against Benin. He has earned 69 international caps and scored 21 goals for his country. He played for Senegal in their 2002 FIFA World Cup campaign and was elected to the World Cup All-Star team, after leading Senegal to the quarter-finals and victories over France (1–0) and Sweden (2–1). Senegal eventually lost 1–0 in extra time to Turkey. He was also part of the Senegal team who were the runners-up in the 2002 African Cup of Nations, but was one of the players who missed a penalty during the shootout in the final as they lost to Cameroon. Diouf was banned from international football for four matches in 2004 for a verbal assault on referee Ali Bujsaim.

In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers selected by Pelé in conjunction with FIFA&#x27;s centenary celebrations. In October 2007, Diouf retired from international football, stating he had been frustrated by organisational problems with the side. However, Senegal coach Henryk Kasperczak announced later in the month that he would name Diouf in the next squad.

In 2011 Diouf was banned for five years from playing for the Senegal national side, after reacting angrily to claims that he had failed to attend a disciplinary hearing. In September 2012, The Senegal Football Federation confirmed that Diouf&#x27;s five-year ban had been decreased and that he was available to play for the Senegal national side again. After becoming available for the Senegal national side, in October 2012 Diouf was left out of the squad to face Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in an African Cup of Nations qualifier, Diouf proclaimed that he felt he was left out of the squad because the Senegal federation were &#x27;scared&#x27; of him.

Diouf was twice named the African Footballer of the Year.

==Controversies==

===In France===
Diouf&#x27;s professional career has at times been overshadowed by controversy. During his time at Sochaux, he was involved in a succession of minor transgressions. This resulted in the move to Rennes, where he was convicted for driving without a licence, and was involved in a car crash. Taking into account his age and evident remorse, the French courts sentenced Diouf to community service.

===In England===
Several times during his early Premier League career, Diouf was accused of spitting at fans and opposition players. In 2002, he was accused of spitting at West Ham United fans while warming up as a substitute for Liverpool during a game at Anfield. An investigation by Merseyside Police found no evidence that an offence had been committed, but that Diouf had spat on the ground. On 13 March 2003, while playing for Liverpool, he was involved in an incident when he spat at Celtic fans during a televised UEFA Cup quarter-final. His club fined him two weeks&#x27; wages, UEFA gave him a two-match ban, and Diouf was charged with assault. Although Diouf initially pleaded not guilty, he later changed his plea to guilty, and was fined £5,000.
In November 2004 while on loan to Bolton, Diouf was charged by the police for spitting at an 11-year-old Middlesbrough fan during a 1–1 draw. Then, on 27 November 2004, Diouf spat in the face of Portsmouth player Arjan de Zeeuw. Bolton fined him two weeks&#x27; wages and the FA banned him for three games after he pleaded guilty to a charge of improper conduct. Bolton manager Sam Allardyce later revealed that he considered sending Diouf to see a sports psychologist.

On 20 September 2009, Diouf was questioned by police after allegations that he had made a racial slur to a ball-boy during a match at Everton, telling him to &quot;fuck off, white boy&quot;. Diouf defended his actions by saying that the ball-boy had thrown the ball to him &quot;like a bone to a dog&quot; and that Everton fans were racially abusing and throwing bananas at him. Police found no evidence of this.

In April 2010, Diouf was arrested and charged with motoring offences in Manchester.

On 8 January 2011, following Blackburn&#x27;s 1–0 win over Queens Park Rangers in the FA Cup third round, QPR manager Neil Warnock accused Diouf of taunting Jamie Mackie whilst the latter lay on the pitch injured with a broken leg and referred to Diouf as &quot;lower than a sewer rat&quot;.

On 14 July 2011, it was reported that Diouf had not joined Blackburn Rovers for a pre-season tour of Austria and that his whereabouts were
unknown. The club stated that disciplinary measures would be taken against him.

<text>An Irminsul (Old Saxon &#x27;great pillar&#x27;) was a sacred, pillar-like object attested as playing an important role in the Germanic paganism of the Saxons. Medieval sources describe how an Irminsul was destroyed by Charlemagne during the Saxon Wars. A church was erected on its place in 783 and blessed by Pope Leo III.
Sacred trees and sacred groves were widely venerated by the Germanic peoples (including Donar&#x27;s Oak), and the oldest chronicle describing an Irminsul refers to it as a tree trunk erected in the open air.

==Etymology==

The Old Saxon word compound means &#x27;great pillar&#x27;. The first element, (&#x27;great&#x27;) is cognate with terms with some significance elsewhere in Germanic mythology. Among the North Germanic peoples, the Old Norse form of is , which just like is one of the names of Odin. Yggdrasil (Old Norse &#x27;Yggr&#x27;s horse&#x27;) is a cosmic tree from which Odin sacrificed himself, and which connects the Nine worlds. 19th century scholar Jakob Grimm connects the name with Old Norse terms like (&quot;great ground&quot;, i.e. the Earth) or (&quot;great snake&quot;, i.e. the Midgard serpent).

A Germanic god Irmin, inferred from the name and the tribal name Irminones, is in some older scholarship presumed to have been the national god or demi-god of the Saxons. It has been suggested that was more probably an aspect or epithet of some other deity – most likely Wodan (Odin). Irmin might also have been an epithet of the god Ziu (Tyr) in early Germanic times, only later transferred to Odin, as certain scholars subscribe to the idea that Odin replaced Tyr as the chief Germanic deity at the onset of the Migration Period. This was the favored view of early 20th century Nordicist writers, but it is not generally considered likely in modern times.

==Attestations==
Irminsuls are attested in a variety of historic works discussing the Christianization of the continental Germanic peoples:

===Royal Frankish Annals===
According to the Royal Frankish Annals (772 AD), during the Saxon Wars, Charlemagne is repeatedly described as ordering the destruction of the chief seat of their religion, an Irminsul. The Irminsul is described as not being far from Heresburg (now Obermarsberg), Germany. Jacob Grimm states that &quot;strong reasons&quot; point to the actual location of the Irminsul as being approximately away, in the Teutoburg Forest and states that the original name for the region &quot;Osning&quot; may have meant &quot;Holy Wood&quot;.

===&quot;De miraculis sancti Alexandri&quot;===
The Benedictine monk Rudolf of Fulda (AD 865) provides a description of an Irminsul in chapter 3 of his Latin work &quot;De miraculis sancti Alexandri&quot;. Rudolf&#x27;s description states that the Irminsul was a great wooden pillar erected and worshipped beneath the open sky and that its name, Irminsul, signifies universal all-sustaining pillar.

===Widukind of Corvey===
Clive Tolley has argued that Widukind of Corvey in a passage of his &quot;Deeds of the Saxons&quot; (c. 970) is in fact describing an &quot;ad hoc&quot; Irminsul erected to celebrate the Saxon leader Hadugato&#x27;s victory over the Thuringians in 531. Widukind says the Saxons set up an altar to their god of victory, whose body they depicted as a wooden column:

When morning was come they set up an eagle at the eastern gate, and erecting an altar of victory they celebrated appropriate rites with all due solemnity, according to their ancestral superstition: to the one whom they venerate as their god of Victory they give the name of Mars, and the bodily characteristics of Hercules, imitating his physical proportion by means of wooden columns, and in the hierarchy of their gods he is the Sun, or as the Greeks call him, Apollo. From this fact the opinion of those men appears somewhat probable who hold that the Saxons were descended from the Greeks, because the Greeks call Mars Hirmin or Hermes, a word which we use even to this day, either for blame or praise, without knowing its meaning.
Widukind is confused, however, about the name of the god, since the Roman Mars and the Greek Hermes do not correspond. Tolley supposes that the name Hirmin, of which Widukind does not know the meaning, is not to be related to Hermes, but to Irmin, the dedicatee of the Irminsul.

===Hildesheim===
Under Louis the Pious in the 9th century, a stone column was dug up at Obermarsberg in Westphalia, Germany, and relocated to the Hildesheim cathedral in Hildesheim, Lower Saxony, Germany. The column was reportedly then used as a candelabrum until at least the late 19th century. In the 13th century, the destruction of the Irminsul by Charlemagne was recorded as having still been commemorated at Hildesheim on the Saturday after Laetare Sunday.

The commemoration was reportedly done by planting two poles six feet high, each surmounted by a wooden object one foot in height shaped like a pyramid or a cone on the cathedral square. The youth then used sticks and stones in an attempt to knock over the object. This custom is described as existing elsewhere in Germany, particularly in Halberstadt where it was enacted on the day of Laetare Sunday by the Canons themselves.

===&quot;Kaiserchronik&quot;===

Awareness of the significance of the concept seems to have persisted well into Christian times. For example, in the twelfth-century &quot;Kaiserchronik&quot; an Irminsul is mentioned in three instances:

Concerning the origin of the Wednesday:
Concerning Julius Caesar:
Concerning Nero:
ABBOT DE LUBERSAC (Abbé de Lubersac): Discours sur les Monuments Publics (Speech on Public Monuments)

The abbot place the Irminsul in 
Stattbergen, Bavaria. (P.183)

==Hypotheses==
A number of theories surround the subject of the Irminsul.

===&quot;Germania&quot;, Pillars of Hercules, and Jupiter Columns===
In Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot;, the author mentions rumors of what he describes as &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot; in land inhabited by the Frisii that had yet to be explored. Tacitus adds that these pillars exist either because Hercules actually did go there or because the Romans have agreed to ascribe all marvels anywhere to Hercules&#x27; credit. Tacitus states that while Drusus Germanicus was daring in his campaigns against the Germanic tribes, he was unable to reach this region, and that subsequently no one had yet made the attempt. Connections have been proposed between these &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot; and later accounts of the Irminsuls. Hercules was probably frequently identified with Thor by the Romans due to the practice of &quot;interpretatio romana&quot;.

Comparisons have been made between the Irminsul and the Jupiter Columns that were erected along the Rhine in Germania around the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. Scholarly comparisons were once made between the Irminsul and the Jupiter Columns; however, Rudolf Simek states that the columns were of Gallo-Roman religious monuments, and that the reported location of the Irminsul in Eresburg does not fall within the area of the Jupiter Column archaeological finds.

===Wilhelm Teudt, the Externsteine, and symbol===
The medieval Externsteine relief, located on a rock formation near Detmold, Germany, features a shape often identified as a bent tree at the feet of Nicodemus. In 1929, German lay archaeologist and future Ahnenerbe member Wilhelm Teudt proposed that the symbol represented an Irminsul.

However, according to scholar Bernard Mees:

<doc id="582426" wikidata="Q5596886" url="?curid=582426" title="Granville District">
<text>The Granville District (or Granville&#x27;s district) was an approximately 60-mile wide strip of land in the North Carolina colony adjoining the boundary with the Province of Virginia, lying between north latitudes 35° 34&#x27; and 36° 30&#x27;. From 1663 until 1779, the District was held under control of the descendants of Sir George Carteret, one of the original Lords Proprietors of the Province of Carolina. After 1729, the Granville District&#x27;s land allotment totaled nearly half of the land in North Carolina.

==Background==
The area that became the Granville District had been a part of the Province of Carolina, which was a proprietary colony under the control of eight Lords Proprietors from 1663 to 1729. In 1729, seven of the eight heirs to the original Lords Proprietors decided to sell their shares back to The Crown. 

The eighth share belonged to Lord Carteret, great-grandson of original Lord Proprietor, Sir George Carteret. He surrendered any future participation in the colonial government in order to retain ownership of his share of the colony&#x27;s land.

==Colonial interests==
Due to political reversals in England, Carteret was unable to attend to his colonial interests until 1742. Then he appointed the first of several agents to operate on his authority for the district that he never visited in person. In 1742, the king&#x27;s Privy Council agreed to Carteret&#x27;s request to plan his allotment. The task was given to Samuel Warner, a London surveyor, who determined that Carteret was entitled to fifty-six and a quarter minutes of north latitude. The northern boundary was to be the Virginia–North Carolina border (36° 30&#x27;) making the southern line at 35° 34&#x27;. In 1743, the initial portion of the boundary line was surveyed by a commission appointed jointly by Carteret and North Carolina Governor Gabriel Johnston. As the frontier pushed further westward, the boundary line was extended in 1746, and again in 1753. 

==The Granville District==
In 1744, Carteret inherited the title, &quot;Earl of Granville&quot;, and from that time on, the district became known as &quot;Granville&#x27;s district&quot; or simply, the &quot;Granville District&quot;. After the 1753 extension, other area land owners, including governor Arthur Dobbs, began to complain that the line had been run up to 13 and a half miles too far to the south. This caused some resentment of Granville&#x27;s district because the royal government of North Carolina was still responsible for the security and upkeep of the area, but did not receive any revenue from it.

==Irregularities==
About 1750, Granville began to become concerned about irregularities in the accounts from his agents in regards to the issuance of land grants. He issued explicit instructions to his agents about keeping records and executing grants. Despite Granville&#x27;s instructions, complaints (particularly regarding allegations of exorbitant fees) from land holders and prospective purchasers increased throughout the decade. One such problem involved Henry McCulloh, who had received a large royal grant of land, some of which lay within Granville&#x27;s district. Granville gave McCulloh permission to settle the land. But in 1752, he learned that his agents had issued grants on McCulloh&#x27;s land. McCulloh and Granville disputed the areas, sometimes threatening legal action. They eventually were able to negotiate a series of agreements.

==Problems grow==
After Granville&#x27;s death in 1763, the situation became more muddled. Settlers were unable to obtain clear title to their land. This state of affairs finally led to outbreaks of violence in 1770, known as the War of the Regulation (centered in modern-day Alamance County), which had to be put down by Governor William Tryon.

Although Granville&#x27;s son, Robert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville, had considered selling the land back to The Crown to dis-encumber himself, he never acted. The situation continued to get worse as records were no longer being kept accurately. When the younger Granville died in February 1776, American revolutionary fervor was already strong and the proprietorship of the Granville district had become identified with British interests.

==Confiscated==
In 1777, the Provisional Assembly of the State of North Carolina declared the state sovereign over all the lands between Virginia and South Carolina, although it recognized claims to land granted by the crown and proprietors prior to July 4, 1776. The Assembly called for the confiscation of all lands and property of persons who supported the British. Granville&#x27;s lands were confiscated by the State of North Carolina in 1777; and McCulloh&#x27;s in 1779. 

Following the war, the Carteret heirs were compensated in part for the loss of their lands.

<text>A switch is a flexible rod which is typically used for corporal punishment. Switching is similar to birching.

==Punitive switching==
Switches are typically made of strong and flexible wood such as hazel, birch, or hickory. Willow branches are also used, as well as branches from strong trees and large shrubs. Switches are often from a garden or an orchard nearby, or taken from the wild. In the Southeastern United States, fresh-cut, flexible cane (&quot;Arundinaria&quot;) is commonly used. In the 20th and 21st centuries the use of corporal punishment has been criticized, in both North America and Europe.

Making a switch involves cutting it from the stem and removing twigs or directly attached leaves. For optimal flexibility, it is cut fresh shortly before use, rather than keeping it for re-use over time. Some parents decide to make the cutting of a switch an additional form of punishment for a child, by requiring the disobedient child to cut their own switch.

*The tamarind switch (in Creole English &quot;tambran switch&quot;) is a judicial birch-like instrument for corporal punishment made from three tamarind rods, braided and oiled, used long after independence in the Caribbean Commonwealth island states of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago.
*The Gilbertese tribal community at Wagina in Choiseul province (Solomon Islands) reintroduced by referendum in 2005 traditional &quot;whipping&quot; with coconut tree branches for various offences – the national justice system opposes this.

<doc id="582436" wikidata="Q539725" url="?curid=582436" title="Chūhei Nambu">
<text>was a Japanese track and field athlete. , he is the only person to have held world records in both the long jump and the triple jump.

==Biography==
The first results known for Nambu are from the mid-1920s. He was a member of the Japanese Olympic team at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, where he competed in three events. His best performance came in the triple jump, where he placed fourth, while his countryman Mikio Oda won the gold. In the long jump, he finished ninth, and his 4 × 100 m relay team was eliminated in the heats.

Nambu&#x27;s real breakthrough came in 1931. After improving his Japanese record a few times, he landed a long jump just two cm short of 8 m, a new world record. Jesse Owens broke the world record less than four years later but it stood as an Asian record until it was beaten by Hiroomi Yamada in 1970.

The next year, at the Los Angeles Games, he was one of the favourites for the Olympic titles in both horizontal jumps. Nambu was disappointed with his third place in the long jump, but took revenge in the triple jump final, held a few days after the long jump. His winning mark of 15.72 m set a new world record. Thereby, Nambu became the first athlete to hold the world record in both horizontal jumps. He retained both records until 1935, when he lost them to Jesse Owens (long jump) and Jack Metcalfe (triple jump).

Nambu was also a strong sprinter. He won the 100 m race at the 1930 and 1933 Japanese Championships and set a Japanese record at 10.6 seconds in 1931.

After retiring from competitions Nambu became a sports journalist for &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;. He also remained active in sports, being head coach for the Japanese Athletics Association, and acting as manager of the national team at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. In 1992, he was awarded the Olympic Order in silver by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). He died of pneumonia aged 93.

<text>The Shiant Islands (; or ) or Shiant Isles are a privately owned island group in the Minch, east of Harris in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. They are southeast of the Isle of Lewis.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Shiant&quot; is from the Scottish Gaelic , which means the &quot;charmed&quot;, &quot;holy&quot; or &quot;enchanted isles&quot;. The group is also known as , &quot;the big isles&quot;. The main islands are Garbh Eilean (&quot;rough island&quot;) and Eilean an Taighe (&quot;house island&quot;), which are joined by a narrow isthmus, and Eilean Mhuire (&quot;island of the Virgin Mary&quot;) to the east. Eilean an Taighe was called &quot;Eilean na Cille&quot; (&quot;island of the church&quot;) prior to the 19th century.

A 17th-century chart by John Adair and several other 18th-century charts call Garbh Eilean &quot;Nunaltins Isle&quot;, Eilean Mhuire &quot;St Marys Isle&quot; and Eilean an Taighe &quot;St Columbs Isle&quot;. This last name suggests that the chapel on Eilean an Taighe might have been dedicated to St Columba. The meaning of &quot;Nunaltins&quot; remains unclear.

==Geography and geology==
The Shiant Islands lie east of the Sound of Shiant. Garbh Eilean and Eilean an Taighe together extend to ; the much more fertile Eilean Mhuire extends to . In addition to these main islands, there is a line of Galtachan rocks that lie to the west: Galta Beag, Bodach, Stacan Laidir, Galta Mòr, Sgeir Mhic a&#x27; Ghobha and Damhag.

Geologically, these islands are an extension of the Trotternish peninsula of Skye. Their rocks are volcanic, and, at 60 million years old, very young compared with other Hebridean rocks. Dolerite columns on the north side of Garbh Eilean are over tall and about in diameter. They are much higher in places than those at Staffa and the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, but similar in that they were formed by the slow cooling of volcanic rocks deep underground. Intrusive sills exhibit a progression in their chemical compositions, from olivine-rich rocks at the base, to rocks with very little or no olivine at the top.

The sills are thought to have been formed by crystal settling. Recent study has suggested that at least one of the sills is an example of a multiple intrusion. In some places, the basalt is overlain by Jurassic mudstone, which weathers to form much more fertile soil than is present elsewhere in the Western Isles.

The islands can be visited by means of various cruise ships that operate from other Hebridean Islands and from mainland Scotland. Small boat (RIBs) tours out to the islands are also run by operators from the Outer Hebrides.

==History==

In 1549, Donald Monro, Dean of the Isles wrote in Scots of:

&quot;an isle called Ellan Senta, which means in English &quot;fable island&quot;, an isle more than long, very profitable for grain, stock-rearing and fishing, pertaining to McLeod of Lewis. On the east side of this isle there is a bore, made like a vault, longer(?) than the arrow shot of any man on earth, through which gulping vault we used to row our sail boats, for fear of the horrible break of the seas that is on the outward side, but no large ship can sail through it.&quot; Nicolson (2002) calls this &quot;vault&quot; on Toll a&#x27; Roimh at the north east end of Garbh Eilean the &quot;Hole of the Seals&quot; and describes rowing a dinghy through it.


A century and a half later, in 1703, Martin Martin wrote that
the two southern islands are separated only by spring-tides, and are in circumference. Island-More hath a chapel in it dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and is fruitful in corn and grass; the island joining to it on the west is only for pasturage.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Shiant Islands were home to only eight people. The author and politician Compton MacKenzie owned the islands from 1925 until 1937. He was an island lover who, at different points in his life, also occasionally rented Herm in the Channel Islands. He never lived on the Shiants, but paid several brief visits there during his time as owner.

In 1937, the islands were purchased by Nigel Nicolson, then an undergraduate at Oxford, using money that had been left to him by his grandmother. Nicolson later became a writer, publisher and politician, as MacKenzie had been. Nicolson&#x27;s son, the writer Adam Nicolson, published the definitive book on the islands, &quot;Sea Room&quot; (2001). Today, the Shiants belong to Adam&#x27;s son, Tom Nicolson. Sheep continue to graze the islands, as they have done since the mid-19th century. The simple bothy maintained by the Nicolson family on Eilean an Taighe is the only habitable structure on any of the islands. In 2012, Robert Macfarlane published, in &quot;The Old Ways&quot;, a description of his visit to the islands.

==Wildlife==


The Shiant Islands have a large population of seabirds, including tens of thousands of Atlantic puffins that breed in burrows on the slopes of Garbh Eilean, and significant numbers of common guillemots, razorbills, northern fulmars, black-legged kittiwakes, common shags, gulls and great skuas. (There are fewer puffins on Garbh Eilean than on the remote island of St Kilda, but they are much more densely congregated.)

Until recently, the islands were also home to a population of black rats, &quot;Rattus rattus&quot;, which are presumed to have originally come ashore from a shipwreck. Apart from one or two small islands in the Firth of Forth, the Shiants were the only place in the UK where the black rat (or ship rat) could still be found. There was thought to be a population of about 3,500 rats on the islands in wintertime, with their numbers rising exponentially during the summer. Analysis of their stomach contents had shown that they ate seabirds, but it could not be determined whether they preyed on live birds or simply scavenged dead ones. (Their numbers had for many years been well controlled in and around the house.)

During the winter of 2015–2016, Wildlife Management International Limited initiated a project to permanently eradicate rats from the Shiant Islands, as part of the Shiant Isles Seabird Recovery Project. The project was funded by contributions from the EU, the SNH, the RSPB and many individual donors. In March 2018, the Shiant Islands were deemed to have satisfactorily completed the internationally agreed two-year eradication period, and were officially declared rat-free.

The waters around the Shiant Islands are home to a fantastic variety of marine wildlife including grey and harbour seals, fin whales, killer whales, dolphins, basking sharks, porpoises.

<doc id="582439" wikidata="Q953229" url="?curid=582439" title="Advance Wars">
<text>Advance Wars is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It is the seventh title in the &quot;Wars&quot; series of video games, and the first in the &quot;Advance Wars&quot; sub-series. The game takes place on a fictional continent, where two nations, Orange Star and Blue Moon, have been fighting each other for years. The conflict enters a new stage when an Orange Star commanding officer named Andy is accused of attacking the armies of two other nations, Yellow Comet and Green Earth, without reason, resulting in a worldwide war.

As with previous &quot;Wars&quot; titles, &quot;Advance Wars&quot; was not originally intended for release outside Japan, due to Nintendo feeling that Western consumers would not be interested in turn-based games because of their complex mechanics. In order to alleviate this, the developers made the mechanics easy to understand, adding in an in-depth tutorial that did not require players to read the manual. Designer Kentaro Nishimura commented that the game&#x27;s success shifted Nintendo&#x27;s attitude over Western tastes , and that same success is frequently credited as a driving force for Nintendo bringing another Intelligent Systems franchise, &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, outside of Japan beginning with the seventh installment.

&quot;Advance Wars&quot; was released in North America on September 10, 2001. Its release in Japan and Europe was delayed due to the release date in connections with the September 11 attacks in the United States. Although eventually released in Europe in January 2002, it would not be released in Japan until the &quot;Game Boy Wars Advance 1+2&quot; compilation in 2004 alongside its sequel &quot;Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising&quot;, whose original Japanese release was cancelled. &quot;Advance Wars&quot; has been re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console simultaneously in Europe and North America on April 3, 2014. On April 21, 2023, the title was remade for the Nintendo Switch alongside its sequel &quot;Black Hole Rising&quot; in a compilation developed by WayForward titled &quot;Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp&quot;, which was announced by Nintendo at E3 2021. It was released in America and Europe, but not Japan.

==Gameplay==
The objective in each mission is to defeat the enemy army. There are two ways to defeat an opponent: destroy every one of the opponent&#x27;s units on the map, known as routing the enemy, or capture the opponent&#x27;s headquarters. However, some maps have specific objectives, such as capturing a certain number of cities to claim victory or survive a set number of days. The available modes of play include &quot;Field Training&quot; which offers tutorial missions, a campaign mode which carries the game&#x27;s storyline, the &quot;War Room&quot; which is a collection of maps on which the player strives for high scores, as well as multiplayer modes and a map design mode. The &quot;Campaign&quot; and &quot;War Room&quot; modes both help to rank the player up (from Rank #100 to Rank #1) and to earn coins to unlock COs and maps in the &quot;Battle Maps&quot; shop. The modes also gives the player an additional rank for effort after winning a battle on that map, which assesses the player&#x27;s speed, power, and technique in that battle; speed being the number of days spent trying to win the battle, power being how many enemy units were defeated, and technique is the number of the player&#x27;s units that survived (in percentage).

===Battle system===
The battles of &quot;Advance Wars&quot; are turn-based. Two to four armies, each headed by a CO (commanding officer), take turns building and commanding units on grid-based maps, while attacking enemy units, moving positions, holding ground, or capturing enemy/neutral properties (cities, ports, airports, bases, or HQ).

 All units are limited in the types of units they can attack. What dictates a unit&#x27;s ability to attack different targets are its primary and secondary weapons. For example, the Mech unit has a bazooka that can only be fired at land vehicles, but are more powerful for that purpose than their secondary weapons, machine guns, which Mechs can use against other Mechs, infantry, and helicopters.

Units that can attack do so either directly (can attack adjacent to another unit where standing or moved, but will be counter-attacked by the enemy unit), or indirectly (must remain still to attack, and have an enemy in firing range). The amount of damage done by a unit to an enemy unit in combat comes down to a number of factors: the number of hit points the attacker has, whether they can fire their main weapon (if not, they either cannot attack or will use their secondary weapon instead), the type of unit the attacker and the defender are, and the terrain the enemy unit is on; by contrast, if the enemy unit is directly attacked, the same factors determine the damage done when they counter-attack the attacking unit. The majority of units have main weapons with a limited supply of ammunition, with the amount of ammo depending on the type of unit. Units with secondary weapons will resort to these when their primary weapon&#x27;s ammunition runs out until they are resupplied.

===Terrain===
The terrain on a map affects unit movement, vision, and the defense attribute of units stationed in the terrain. The different types of terrain include: roads, plains, woods, bases, HQs (Headquarters), ports, cities, airports, the sea, reefs, shoals, rivers, and mountains. All units are affected by terrain, except air units, which gain neither an advantage or a disadvantage as a result. Weather conditions, when active, can affect the vision and movement of ground units, while fog of war, when active, can reduce a player&#x27;s vision, making them depend on individual units&#x27; lines of sight, which varies from unit to unit; infantry can expand the vision when in mountains, while woods and reefs cannot be seen into unless a unit is adjacent (next) to it.

===Units===
There are 18 different types of military units in &quot;Advance Wars&quot;. Each unit has a set amount of attack power, vision range in fog of war, movement range and type, and fuel supply. Some units are equipped with two weapons, which can be used against different types of enemy units. There are both direct and indirect attack units, as well as unarmed transport units. All the units are either infantry, vehicles, ships, or air units. Units have specific strengths and weaknesses. One rule of thumb that units have to adhere to is that a portion of their fuel supply is used up each turn; ground units who run out cannot move, while air and naval units who run out are destroyed as they consume fuel even when stationary. Submarines consume more fuel than usual when submerged.

===Multiplayer===
In Multiplayer mode, players can compete against the AI or against other human players. Multiplayer matches feature a variety of settings that can be changed pre-battle. Multiplayer comes in two forms: Versus mode and Link mode. In Versus mode, only one GBA system is used, which every participant in the game uses. One player will take their turn, then pass the system to the next. Link mode is the same game as Versus mode gameplay-wise, but multiple consoles are used, one for each person. It can be played with just one game pak or with one game pak per player.

===Commanding officers===
Armies are led by COs, who control units. Most COs provide units with innate special advantages and disadvantages, such as extra firepower, greater strength, or a shorter firing range, with some COs being better with specific units (e.g. being better with air units than naval units). COs also have a Power Meter which fills up by defeating enemy units or when on the receiving end of a brutal offensive attack. When the meter is full, a CO can unleash their &quot;CO Power&quot;, which gives a temporary positive effect to friendly units and/or a negative effect to enemy units. For example, Nell gives a Critical Strike bonus to her units and Olaf makes it snow, limiting the movement range of his opponent.

==Plot==
The story of the &quot;Advance Wars&quot; begins in the &quot;Field Training&quot; tutorial mode, with the nation of Orange Star in a war against the neighboring nation of Blue Moon, with Olaf as the Blue Moon Army commanding officer (CO). Olaf suddenly ordered an invasion of the Orange Star nation and is in battle with the Orange Star Army. The campaign continues the story that started in the tutorial. Nell, the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Orange Star COs, gives the player the duty of a tactical advisor for the Orange Star Army.

The player follows the war effort through all four countries, with its own COs, over the course of the game. Starting with having only one choice of a CO to advise, Andy, the player will have a choice of two more Orange Star COs, Max and Sami, to advise as the story progresses, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Depending on which CO is chosen by the player to advise, there are times when a mission is split into a choice of two or three, where the maps and dialog could be different. After completing that mission, the story paths could split up, depending on which CO was chosen in that previous mission, with the story differing from the other path, eventually leading back to the main path.

After winning a battle against Green Earth, Andy gets mysteriously accused by Green Earth&#x27;s CO, Eagle, of committing a treacherous act of aggression against Green Earth. After defeating the Blue Moon troops that invaded the Orange Star country, the Orange Star Army then invade the Blue Moon country, defeating their troops. The Blue Moon COs, Olaf and Grit, are revealed to be COs who both used to work for the Orange Star Army, but switched to Blue Moon. When the Orange Star Army&#x27;s intention was to just pass through the other two countries, Green Earth and Yellow Comet, the countries&#x27; COs like Kanbei of Yellow Comet assume a threat of an invasion and declare battles against the Orange Star Army in their land.

Later on, Green Earth CO Drake tells Eagle that the Orange Star Army did not attack Green Earth, saying that &quot;This entire conflict has been orchestrated from the beginning&quot;. Meanwhile, Yellow Comet CO Sonja and Grit try to discover the person who is really behind the attacks. When Eagle meets Andy again, Eagle again accuses Andy of attacking Green Earth, to which the Orange Star COs eventually convince Eagle that it was not Andy who attacked Green Earth. This explains why the three nations have been declaring battles against Orange Star, as they thought Andy attacked them first.

When Eagle meets Sonja, Sonja also tells Eagle that Andy was not behind the attacks, saying it was someone else, and goes with her to see what she discovered. It is revealed that the enigmatic Black Hole Army, under the command of Sturm, is the true enemy. Using a CO doppelganger clone of Andy, Sturm stirred up war among the four countries in order to confuse, weaken, and eventually conquer them. Once this is revealed, the four countries unite to drive Black Hole out of their land, the Cosmo Land, with COs automatically chosen depending on the paths the player took during the game.

==Development==
&quot;Advance Wars&quot; was first announced at Nintendo Space World 2000 under the name &quot;Game Boy Wars Advance&quot;. In January 2001, Nintendo France gave new screenshots from this and other Game Boy Advance games to French gaming sites with little other information. It was developed by Intelligent Systems, and eventually published by Nintendo. Four player mode was confirmed before E3 2001 and with it a US release date of September 10. &quot;Game Boy Wars Advance&quot; was originally scheduled for an October 12, 2001 release in Japan, but it was canceled in order to avoid competition with &quot;Game Boy Wars 3&quot; (released for the Game Boy Color that same year). It was eventually released in a two-in-one compilation in 2004 with its sequel, &quot;Game Boy Wars Advance 2&quot;.

Development of &quot;Advance Wars&quot; began alongside the Game Boy Advance launch titles, but because Nintendo was so busy with them, they requested that Intelligent Systems assist in the development. Director Makoto Shimojo commented that the early stages of development often feature Intelligent Systems coming up with unique game mechanics for it, and upon presenting to Nintendo, typically being told that it was &quot;too sophisticated&quot; or &quot;not balanced for a general audience&quot;. At which point, they began working on adjustments. The game was designed with the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s young children audience, giving the game a &quot;pop design&quot;, with bright colors, rounded characters, and comedy. Shimojo commented that in spite of this, the majority of purchasers were teenage boys. In order to cope with bringing a strategy game to a handheld with a younger audience, Shimojo and his team made the game featuring &quot;waves of excitement&quot;; he compared this to how long films will introduce calm periods in order to have good pacing.

Shimojo discussed how various developers introduced elements from their favorite genres into the game. He gave examples which included a developer who was a fan of shooters designing the movement system to work in a way that allows players to control their units &quot;down to the perfect centimeter&quot;, as well as a developer who was a fan of rhythm games adding a rhythm to how the units move. Intelligent Systems also attempted to cater to those who had a more serious interest in the weapons and the costume designs. As a result, they followed real history in developing these aspects, though making deformed versions of these weapons rather than duplications. The story and setting of the game were designed to not be gritty and serious, but to still be sophisticated.

In order to ensure that the game was balanced, the designers had to play through maps several times to ensure that they were not unbalanced. Shimojo commented that once he became more astute at the game, it became hard for him to judge what it would be like for a novice to play, though he comments that his goal is to ensure that the difficulty level is right enough to allow the largest number of people to play it. Afterward, his comments are sent off to other staff members so he can be sure that he got it right. From then on, the game is sent to Nintendo&#x27;s debugging team, who will then provide insight on the balance to the development team, who makes adjustments accordingly.

Shimojo commented that the balance checking basically went on until someone said: &quot;Stop it, stop it, we really have to launch it now&quot;. He attributes this work to why &quot;Advance Wars&quot; is so highly revered. In designing maps, he comments that it is impossible to please everyone, explaining that some people prefer maps where they start out weak and grow stronger, while others prefer to start out strong and tear through their opponent. His goal was to ensure that there were enough maps that people could say &quot;Here we go, here’s one of my maps. This is what I was waiting for&quot;. The mechanic of unlocking maps was introduced into the game as a means of getting gamers to play the game for longer, but in an interview discussing why the feature was removed in the future title &quot;Advance Wars: Days of Ruin&quot;, a developer commented that it prevented people who were too busy to spend the time unlocking levels, and that there were better ways to keep players interested.

&quot;Advance Wars&quot; was originally intended to remain exclusive to Japan, like the previous entries in the series, which were kept in Japan due to Nintendo feeling that consumers would not be interested in turn-based games, or in such complicated games. In order to alleviate this, the developers made the mechanics easy to understand, adding in an in-depth tutorial that did not require players to read the manual. When Nintendo&#x27;s US marketing division played the game, they found it to be great, wondering why they could not sell it in the US. Designer Kentaro Nishimura commented that &quot;&quot;Advance Wars&quot;&#x27; success shifted Nintendo&#x27;s attitude over western tastes&quot;. He added that without &quot;Advance Wars&quot;, &quot;Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade&quot;, a game that he also designed, would never have been released outside Japan.

===Virtual Console===
The game was released on the Wii U Virtual Console on April 3, 2014, in North America and Europe. In Japan, the compilation which includes both &quot;Advance Wars&quot; and &quot;Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising&quot; games were released on the same day.

==Reception==
Upon release, the game received a score of 92/100 according to the review aggregation website Metacritic, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. According to Julian Gollop, developer of &quot;X-COM&quot; and &quot;&quot;, &quot;Advance Wars&quot;, besides being influential, opened up the market for similar games on handheld video game systems. It was rated the 26th best game made on a Nintendo System in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 200 Games list.

&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; awarded the game a perfect 5 star rating, stating that &quot;&quot;Advance Wars&quot; treads on new ground, taking the strategy genre to a place where gamers of all tastes will be gung-ho for it&quot;. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; called the game &quot;a deep, quite cartoony and consummately Japanese turn-based wargame with depth, character and replayability to burn&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; called the game &quot;incredibly intense and amazingly addictive... especially when you learn every little nuance of the game design&quot;. &quot;Gaming Age&quot; wrote: &quot;There is a perfect blend of simplicity and complexity that makes this game so highly addictive&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that the game is &quot;deep and easy to learn, and it contains a level of replay rarely witnessed in handheld gaming&quot;. &quot;Total Video Games&quot; noted: &quot;For a handheld, the AI of your computer-controlled opponents is surprisingly diverse and complex&quot;. &quot;AllGame&quot; commented: &quot;Ingeniously designed, &quot;Advance Wars&quot; manages to be both in-depth, and instantly accessible, simply because it presents the game in easily manageable chunks&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Advance Wars&quot; the best Game Boy Advance game of 2001. It was nominated for the publication&#x27;s annual &quot;Biggest Surprise&quot; prize among console games, but lost to &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;. During the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Advance Wars&quot; with &quot;Hand-Held Game of the Year&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; called the game &quot;an almost faultless blend of fiendish strategy and Nintendo magic&quot;, placing it 72nd on a list of greatest Nintendo games. In their October 2013 issue, &quot;Edge&quot; retroactively awarded the game ten out of ten, one of only twenty-three games to achieve that perfect score in the magazine&#x27;s twenty-year history.

<doc id="582440" wikidata="Q915402" url="?curid=582440" title="Luhn algorithm">
<text>The Luhn algorithm or Luhn formula, also known as the &quot;modulus 10&quot; or &quot;mod 10&quot; algorithm, named after its creator, IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn, is a simple check digit formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers. It is described in US patent 2950048A, granted on .

The algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is specified in ISO/IEC 7812-1. It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; it was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit card numbers and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers.

==Description==
The check digit is computed as follows:
# Drop the check digit from the number (if it&#x27;s already present). This leaves the payload.
# Start with the payload digits. Moving from right to left, double every second digit, starting from the last digit. If doubling a digit results in a value &gt; 9, subtract 9 from it (or sum its digits). 
# Sum all the resulting digits (including the ones that were not doubled).
# The check digit is calculated by formula_1, where s is the sum from step 3. This is the smallest number (possibly zero) that must be added to formula_2 to make a multiple of 10. Other valid formulas giving the same value are formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5. Note that the formula formula_6 will not work in all environments due to differences in how negative numbers are handled by the modulo operation.

=== Example for computing check digit ===

Assume an example of an account number 1789372997 (just the &quot;payload&quot;, check digit not yet included):

The sum of the resulting digits is 56.

The check digit is equal to formula_7.

This makes the full account number read 17893729974.

=== Example for validating check digit ===

# Drop the check digit (last digit) of the number to validate. (e.g. 17893729974 → 1789372997)
# Calculate the check digit (see above)
# Compare your result with the original check digit. If both numbers match, the result is valid. 

==Strengths and weaknesses==
The Luhn algorithm will detect all single-digit errors, as well as almost all transpositions of adjacent digits. It will not, however, detect transposition of the two-digit sequence &quot;09&quot; to &quot;90&quot; (or vice versa). It will detect most of the possible twin errors (it will not detect &quot;22&quot; ↔ &quot;55&quot;, &quot;33&quot; ↔ &quot;66&quot; or &quot;44&quot; ↔ &quot;77&quot;).

Other, more complex check-digit algorithms (such as the Verhoeff algorithm and the Damm algorithm) can detect more transcription errors. The Luhn mod N algorithm is an extension that supports non-numerical strings.

Because the algorithm operates on the digits in a right-to-left manner and zero digits affect the result only if they cause shift in position, zero-padding the beginning of a string of numbers does not affect the calculation. Therefore, systems that pad to a specific number of digits (by converting 1234 to 0001234 for instance) can perform Luhn validation before or after the padding and achieve the same result.

The algorithm appeared in a United States Patent for a simple, hand-held, mechanical device for computing the checksum. The device took the mod 10 sum by mechanical means. The &quot;substitution digits&quot;, that is, the results of the double and reduce procedure, were not produced mechanically. Rather, the digits were marked in their permuted order on the body of the machine.

== Pseudocode implementation ==

The following function takes a card number, including the check digit, as an array of integers and outputs true if the check digit is correct, false otherwise.

 function isValid(cardNumber[1..length])
 sum := 0
 parity := length mod 2
 for i from 1 to (length - 1) do
 if i mod 2 != parity then
 sum := sum + cardNumber[i]
 elseif cardNumber[i] &gt; 4 then
 sum := sum + 2 * cardNumber[i] - 9
 else
 sum := sum + 2 * cardNumber[i]
 end if
 end for
 return cardNumber[length] == ((10 - (sum mod 10)) mod 10)
 end function

== Uses ==
The Luhn algorithm is used in a variety of systems, including:
* Credit card numbers
* IMEI numbers
* CUSIP numbers for North American financial instruments
* National Provider Identifier numbers in the United States
* Canadian social insurance numbers
* Israeli ID numbers
* South African ID numbers
* South African Tax reference numbers
* Swedish national identification numbers
* Swedish Corporate Identity Numbers (OrgNr)
* Greek Social Security Numbers (ΑΜΚΑ)
* ICCID of SIM cards
* European patent application numbers
* Survey codes appearing on McDonald&#x27;s, Taco Bell, and Tractor Supply Co. receipts
* United States Postal Service package tracking numbers use a modified Luhn algorithm
* Italian VAT numbers (Partita Iva)

<doc id="582442" wikidata="Q449794" url="?curid=582442" title="Yvonne Printemps">
<text>Yvonne Printemps (; born Yvonne Wigniolle; 25 July 1894 – 19 January 1977) was a French singer and actress who achieved stardom on stage and screen in France and internationally.

Printemps went on the stage in Paris at the age of 12, and at 21 she was singled out by the actor, director and playwright Sacha Guitry as a leading lady. In 1919 they were married, and worked closely together until 1932, when they divorced. Printemps never remarried, but had a personal and professional partnership with the actor Pierre Fresnay which lasted until his death in 1975.

As a performer, Printemps was famed for the quality of her singing voice and for her personal charm. Among those who composed for her were André Messager, Reynaldo Hahn, Noël Coward and Francis Poulenc. Her voice could have led her to an operatic career, but guided by Guitry she concentrated on operette and other types of musical show, along with non-musical plays and films. In addition to her many successes in Paris she appeared to great acclaim in the West End of London, and on Broadway in New York.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Printemps was born in Ermont, a northern suburb of Paris, as Yvonne Wigniolle. Despite the misgivings of what she later described as &quot;my highly &quot;bourgeois&quot; family&quot;, she made her debut as a performer at the age of 12 in a revue at La Cigale in Paris. The music critic J. B. Steane writes of her, &quot;A career at the Opéra-Comique seemed possible, for she had a voice of delightful quality with prodigious breath control.&quot;

The possibility of an operatic career did not materialise. Printemps was dancing at the Folies Bergère at the age of 13. She was given the sobriquet Printemps (springtime) by her fellow chorus members because of her sunny disposition, and adopted it as her stage name. She appeared in small roles in light musical shows such as &quot;Les Contes de Perrault&quot; (1913). Louis Verneuil saw her in one of them while he was writing a revue, &quot;1915&quot;, and insisted on casting her in the leading part in it. In the revue she performed a parody of the actor-playwright Sacha Guitry, &quot;whose mannerisms she imitated with spry irreverence.&quot; Guitry&#x27;s wife, Charlotte, saw the show, was greatly amused and soon afterwards brought her husband to see it.

===Early work and marriage ===

In November 1915 Guitry cast Printemps in his new revue, which he directed but did not appear in. A year later they acted together in his new comedy, &quot;Jean de la Fontaine&quot;. It was rumoured that Printemps was having an affair with Guitry&#x27;s father, the eminent actor Lucien Guitry; whatever the truth of that rumour, it is undisputed that she became romantically involved with Sacha. Charlotte Guitry, discovering the liaison, left her husband; they divorced in 1918 and in April 1919 he married Printemps.

Guitry wrote many plays for her, some musical and others straight comedies. Both he and his father appeared with her in several of them, including &quot;Mon Père avait raison&quot; and &quot;Comment on ecrit l&#x27;histoire&quot;. They played together not only in Paris, but in the West End of London. All three appeared at the Aldwych Theatre in a four-week season in 1920. Sir John Gielgud wrote that Printemps and her husband &quot;returned … many times to delight London in various pieces artfully contrived by him to show them both off to the best possible advantage.&quot; He described her thus:

In 1925, Guitry had the idea of writing a musical comedy about the life of the youthful Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart while in Paris in the 1770s. To compose the score he approached André Messager, with whom he had successfully collaborated in 1923 on a show for Printemps, &quot;L&#x27;amour masqué&quot;. Messager was unavailable and recommended the young composer Reynaldo Hahn, who accepted the commission. The resulting production, &quot;Mozart&quot;, took some liberties with historical accuracy, but it proved highly popular. Printemps, in a breeches role, played and sang the young Mozart, with Guitry as the composer&#x27;s patron, Baron Grimm. Gielgud recalled, &quot;she seemed ravishingly youthful and touching in her powdered wig, black knee breeches and buckled shoes, while Sacha hovered over her with avuncular authority, not attempting to try to sing himself, but contributing a kind of flowing, rhythmic accompaniment with his speeches, delivered in a deep caressing voice.&quot; After playing successfully at the Théâtre Edouard VII, the company presented the piece for a three-week season in London in June and July 1926. The critic James Agate wrote, &quot;It is not exaggerating to say that on Monday evening people were observed to cry, and by that I mean shed tears, when Music&#x27;s heavenly child appeared at the top of the stairs. At that moment of her entrance this exquisite artist made conquest of the house, and subsequently held it in thrall until the final curtain.&quot; After the London production, Guitry took the piece to Broadway, Boston and Montreal in late 1926 and early 1927.

===Later life and career===
In 1932 Printemps&#x27;s marriage to Guitry broke up. Guitry soon remarried; Printemps never did so, but became the personal and professional partner of the actor Pierre Fresnay. In February 1934 she had a personal success in London in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Conversation Piece&quot;. Coward wrote the role of Melanie with Printemps in mind, and as she spoke practically no English, she learned the part phonetically. Her singing of the big romantic number, &quot;I&#x27;ll follow my secret heart&quot;, was the highlight of the show. &quot;The Times&quot; said of her performance:
&quot;The Observer&quot; said, &quot;The best conversation in this piece is not that which occurs on the stage, but that which flashes over the footlights between the bright eyes of Miss Yvonne Printemps and her fascinated audience.&quot; Her co-star at the premiere was Coward himself; he habitually avoided long stage runs, and handed over his role to Fresnay in April 1934. Fresnay too won excellent reviews, and his stage partnership with Printemps was greatly admired. In the same year Printemps and Fresnay had a screen hit in Abel Gance&#x27;s &quot;La dame aux camélias&quot;. Between then and 1951 she was in eight films alongside him.

In 1937, Printemps had another great success in musical comedy with Oscar Straus&#x27;s &quot;Drei Waltzer&quot;, given in French as &quot;Trois valses&quot;. She and Fresnay starred in the piece on the Parisian stage and on film (&quot;Les trois valses&quot;). The critic Richard Traubner commented in 2006 that because of the performances of Printemps and Fresnay the film still &quot;hangs over anyone who dares revive the operetta on stage&quot;. In 1946 Printemps had another hit in Marcel Achard&#x27;s &quot;Auprès de ma blonde&quot;. In 1950 she appeared as Hortense Schneider with Fresnay as Jacques Offenbach, in Achard&#x27;s film &quot;La Valse de Paris&quot;. She continued to perform on stage until she was well into her sixties, and remained active with Fresnay, co-directing the Théâtre de la Michodière in Paris with him until his death in 1975.

Printemps died in the Paris suburb of Neuilly in 1977 aged 82. She is interred with Fresnay in the Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery.

<text>The Age of Aquarius, in astrology, is either the current or forthcoming astrological age, depending on the method of calculation. Astrologers maintain that an astrological age is a product of the Earth&#x27;s slow precessional rotation and lasts for 2,160 years, on average (one 25,920 year period of precession, or &quot;great year&quot;, divided by 12 zodiac signs equals a 2,160 year astrological age).

There are various methods of calculating the boundaries of an astrological age. In Sun-sign astrology, the first sign is Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces, whereupon the cycle returns to Aries and through the zodiacal signs again. Astrological ages proceed in the opposite direction. Therefore, the Age of Aquarius follows the Age of Pisces.

==Overview==
The approximate 2,160 years for each age corresponds to the average time it takes for the vernal equinox to move from one constellation of the zodiac into the next. This average can be computed by dividing the Earth&#x27;s 25,800 year gyroscopic precession period by 12, the number of zodiacal signs. This is only a rough calculation, as the length of time it takes for a complete precession is currently increasing. A more accurate set of figures is 25,772 years for a complete cycle and 2,147.5 years per astrological age, assuming a constant precession rate. According to various astrologers&#x27; calculations, approximate dates for entering the age of Aquarius range from (Terry MacKinnell) to (John Addey).

Astrologers do not agree on when the Aquarian age will start or even if it has already started. lists various references from mainly astrological sources for the start of the Age of Aquarius. Based on Campion&#x27;s summary, most published materials on the subject state that the Age of Aquarius arrived in the 20th century (29 claims), with the 24th century in second place with 12 claimants.

Astrological ages are taken to be associated with the precession of the equinoxes. The slow wobble of the Earth&#x27;s rotation axis on the celestial sphere is independent of the diurnal rotation of the Earth on its own axis and the annual revolution of the Earth around the Sun. Traditionally this 25,800 year-long cycle is calibrated, for the purposes of determining astrological ages, by the perceived location of the Sun in one of the 12 zodiac constellations at the vernal (Spring) equinox, which corresponds to the moment the Sun is perceived as crossing the celestial equator, marking the start of spring in the Northern Hemisphere each year. Roughly every 2,150 years the Sun&#x27;s position at the time of the vernal equinox will have moved into a new zodiacal constellation.

In 1929 the International Astronomical Union defined the edges of the 88 official constellations. The edge established between Pisces and Aquarius officially locates the beginning of the Aquarian Age around Many astrologers dispute this approach because of the varying sizes and overlap between the zodiacal constellations. They prefer the long-established convention of equally-sized signs, spaced every 30 degrees along the ecliptic, which are named after what were the 12 background zodiacal constellations when tropical astrology was codified 

==Astrological meaning==
Astrologers believe that an astrological age affects humanity, possibly by influencing the rise and fall of civilizations or cultural tendencies.

Traditionally, Aquarius is associated with

: electricity 
: computers 
: flight 
: democracy 
: freedom 
: humanitarianism 
: idealism 
: modernization 
: nervous disorders 
: rebellion 
: nonconformity 
: philanthropy 
: veracity 
: perseverance 
: humanity 

Among other dates, one view is that the age of Aquarius arrived around 1844, with the harbinger of Siyyid ʿAlí Muḥammad (1819–1850), who founded Bábism.

 promoted the view that, although no one knows when the Aquarian age begins, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the discovery of electricity are all attributable to Aquarian influence. They make a number of predictions about the trends that they believe will develop in the Aquarian age.

Proponents of medieval astrology suggest that the Pisces world where religion is the opiate of the masses will be replaced in the Aquarian age by a world ruled by secretive, power-hungry elites seeking absolute power over others; that knowledge in the Aquarian age will only be valued for its ability to win wars; that knowledge and science will be abused, not industry and trade; and that the Aquarian age will be another dark age in which religion is considered offensive.

Another view suggests that the rise of scientific rationalism, combined with the fall of religious influence, the increasing focus on human rights since the 1780s, the exponential growth of technology, plus the advent of flight and space travel, are evidence of the dawning of the age of Aquarius.

A &quot;wave&quot; theory of the shifting &quot;great ages&quot; suggests that the age of Aquarius will not arrive on a given date, but is instead emerging in influence over many years, similar to how the tide rises gradually, by small increments, rather than surging forward all at once.

Rudolf Steiner believed that the age of Aquarius will arrive in In Steiner&#x27;s approach, each age is exactly 2,160 years. Based on this structure, the world has been in the age of Pisces since 1413. Rudolf Steiner had spoken about two great spiritual events: The return of Christ in the ethereal world (and not in a physical body), because people must develop their faculties until they can reach the ethereal world; and the incarnation of Ahriman, Zoroaster&#x27;s &quot;destructive spirit&quot; that will try to block the development of humanity.

In a 1890 article about feminism in the French newspaper &quot;La Fronde&quot; on 26 February 1890, August Vandekerkhove stated: &quot;About March, 21st this year the cycle of Aquarius will start. Aquarius is the house of the woman&quot;. He adds that is in this age the woman will be &quot;equal&quot; to the man.

Gnostic philosopher Samael Aun Weor declared 4 February 1962 to be the beginning of the &quot;age of Aquarius&quot;, heralded by the alignment of the first six planets, the Sun, the Moon and the constellation Aquarius.

Psychoanalyst Carl Jung mentions the &quot;age of Aquarius&quot; in his book &quot;Aion&quot;, believing that the &quot;age of Aquarius&quot; will &quot;constellate the problem of the union of the opposites&quot;. In accordance with prominent astrologers, Jung believed the &quot;age of Aquarius&quot; will be a dark and spiritually deficient time for humanity, writing that
: &quot;it will no longer be possible to write off evil as the mere privation of good; its real existence will have to be recognized in the &quot;age of Aquarius&quot;&quot;.

According to Jung&#x27;s interpretation of astrology, the &quot;age of Pisces&quot; began with the birth and death of Christ, associating the ichthys (colloquially known as the &quot;Jesus fish&quot;) with the symbol of Pisces; following the &quot;age of Pisces&quot; would be the &quot;age of Aquarius&quot;, the spiritually deficient age before the arrival of the Antichrist.

==Common cultural associations==
The expression &quot;age of Aquarius&quot; in popular culture usually refers to the heyday of the hippie and New Age movements in the 1960s and 1970s.

The 1967 musical &quot;Hair&quot;, with its opening song &quot;Aquarius&quot; which features the line &quot;This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius&quot; in the chorus, brought the Aquarian age concept to the attention of audiences worldwide. The song further defines this &quot;dawning of the age&quot; within the first lines:
: &quot;When the moon is in the Seventh House
: And Jupiter aligns with Mars
: Then peace will guide the planets
: And love will steer the stars&quot;.

The 1969 cover version by American R&amp;B group the 5th Dimension (a medley that also incorporates part of the song &quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot;), became a radio hit, remaining at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart for several weeks.

Astrologer Neil Spencer denounced the lyrics as &quot;astrological gibberish&quot;, noting that Jupiter aligns with Mars several times a year and the Moon is in the 7th house for two hours every day.

The Woodstock music festival was billed as &quot;an Aquarian exposition&quot;.

<text>Teren Delvon Jones (born August 12, 1972), better known by his stage name Del the Funky Homosapien (sometimes stylized as Del tha Funkee Homosapien) or Sir DZL, is an American rapper.

==Music career==
===1988–1997: Early life and beginnings===
Born in Oakland, California, he is the cousin of seminal West Coast rapper Ice Cube, and began his career writing lyrics for Ice Cube&#x27;s group Da Lench Mob. In 1991, with the help of Ice Cube, Del released his first solo album, &quot;I Wish My Brother George Was Here&quot;, at the age of 19. The album was a commercial success largely due to the popularity of the hit single &quot;Mistadobalina&quot;. Ultimately Del, who was not pleased with the limited musical range of the album, severed his production-artist relationship with Ice Cube for his next album, &quot;No Need for Alarm&quot;.

&quot;No Need for Alarm&quot; saw the introduction of the Oakland clique Hieroglyphics, whose original members included Souls of Mischief (Opio, A-Plus, Phesto and Tajai), Casual, Pep Love, Del, and producer Domino. &quot;No Need for Alarm&quot; helped to expose both the regional Oakland sound of hip hop, as well as the freestyle based, &quot;golden era 90s&quot; style of hip hop being expanded at the time.

=== 1998–2006: Middle era ===
Del would not produce another album for five years. About a month before the release of his third album, &quot;Future Development&quot;, Del received a letter from his label, Elektra, stating that his contract had been terminated. Together with his crew, Del established his own independent record label, Hieroglyphics Imperium Recordings, which primarily consists of an expanded Hieroglyphics roster and a few other artists with whom the group collaborates on a regular basis. &quot;Future Development&quot; became available in 1998 and was only available on the Hieroglyphics website in tape form but was re-released in 2002 on the Hieroglyphics Imperium label. Del also released another collaborative work with the Hieroglyphics crew in 1998, which was also the Hieroglyphics crew&#x27;s first album, &quot;3rd Eye Vision&quot;.

Two years later, Del released his fourth solo album, &quot;Both Sides of the Brain&quot;, as well as &quot;Deltron 3030&quot; which was a collaborative work with artists Dan the Automator and Kid Koala. With Nakamura and Koala, Del was also a guest performer for Gorillaz&#x27;s eponymous 2001 album. He appeared on the singles &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;Rock the House&quot;. 2003 saw the release of &quot;Full Circle&quot;, the second full-length album from the Hieroglyphics crew.

In 2004, Elektra released &quot;The Best of Del tha Funkee Homosapien: The Elektra Years&quot; without Del&#x27;s approval. The CD only includes songs from his first two albums, along with a handful of B-sides from that era. Del was not pleased and advised people to not buy the CD, saying it was just Elektra trying to make money off of him due to his newfound fame.

=== 2006–present: Recent years ===
On March 11, 2008, Del released &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot; through Definitive Jux. On March 31, 2009, Del&#x27;s next album &quot;Funk Man (The Stimulus Package)&quot; was made available for free download on the internet. The album is available at his page on Bandcamp, though he gave away some hard copies on his supporting Funk Man tour. In September of the same year, he released a new album, &quot;Automatik Statik&quot;, for an unfixed rate with a minimum of $3.

Del released his next album &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Illegal Yet&quot; on August 6, 2010. There is no fixed price for the album, allowing listeners to pay whatever they wish for the album. Paying certain prices for the album will give certain incentives, including opportunities for personal collaborations with Del. Del released the album &quot;Golden Era&quot; on April 19, 2011, in a three-disc set including &quot;Funk Man (The Stimulus Package)&quot; and &quot;Automatik Statik&quot;.

Del shared a free LP entitled &quot;Iller Than Most&quot; on January 2, 2014. He uploaded the record to SoundCloud under the username Zartan Drednaught COBRA. He described the project as &quot;lyrically ill but fun to listen to, nothing super heavy.&quot; Del handled the production on the project as well.

In 2024, Del formed a series named Manik Mondaze on his YouTube Channel where he and his local crew (which consists of Baslonius.Funk, Lord Takim from the Regional Oakland Group, AMW, Q Shy and many others) where they posts songs weekly and exclusive interviews and behind the scenes on the Manik Mondaze Official Website.

==In other media==
Del&#x27;s songs have seen frequent use in various forms of media including video games, film soundtracks, as well as skateboarding, rollerblading and snowboarding videos. In 2000 the song &quot;Catch All This&quot; from &quot;Both Sides of the Brain&quot; was featured in the game &quot;Street Sk8er 2&quot;, &quot;Jaw Gymnastics&quot;, featuring Casual, was featured in &quot;Knockout Kings&quot;, and &quot;Positive Contact&quot; from &quot;Deltron 3030&quot; was featured in &quot;Mat Hoffman&#x27;s Pro BMX&quot;. In 2001, &quot;If You Must&quot; was featured in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Positive Contact&quot; from &quot;Deltron 3030&quot; was featured in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; and &quot;The Izm&quot; was featured in &quot;Rolling&quot;. In 2005, the Hieroglyphics song &quot;Soweto&quot; is featured on &quot;ESPN NBA 2K5&quot; (the Hieroglyphics crew is unlockable as a bonus team) and Del&#x27;s song &quot;Burnt&quot; was featured in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Catch a Bad One&quot; was featured in &quot;Marc Ecko&#x27;s Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure&quot; and &quot;At the Helm&quot; featuring Hieroglyphics was featured in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot;. Also in 2006, his song &quot;Dr. Bombay&quot; was used in the movie &quot;Beerfest&quot;. The Hieroglyphics song &quot;Don&#x27;t Hate the Player&quot; was also featured in &quot;NBA 2K7&quot;, and &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; was featured in &quot;NBA 2K14&quot;. &quot;Teamwork&quot; is featured on PlayStation Home. Del has had many songs featured in snowboarding movies. &quot;Press Rewind&quot; was the song for Eero Ettala&#x27;s part in the film &quot;White Balance&quot; and &quot;If You Must&quot; was featured in &quot;DC Mountain Lab&quot;.

Del collaborated with John King of the Dust Brothers and Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo to produce the original score for &quot;Skate 3&quot;, released in May 2010. In February 2016, Del, Black Thought, Murs and Fashawn recorded a new track called &quot;Rise Up&quot; for the video game &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;. A music video for the song was released by Capcom, and includes appearances by Del and his fellow collaborators.

In October 2018, Deltron 3030 collaborated with the Cartoon Network animated series &quot;Craig of the Creek&quot;, with Del making an appearance in the episode &quot;The Kid from 3030&quot; as Deltron. The episode featured original songs by Deltron 3030 made just for the episode of the show. Deltron briefly returns in the Season 3 finale singing &quot;Positive Contact&quot; from Deltron 3030&#x27;s debut album of the same name.

He has also made cameo appearances in films, such as Ted Demme&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Who&#x27;s the Man?&quot;, as a teen with two members of Da Youngsta&#x27;s and an uncredited Ashanti, and Jonah Hill&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Mid90s&quot;, as a homeless bum alongside Chad Muska.

He made a guest appearance as a rapper named &quot;Old Skool&quot; (paying homage to Del&#x27;s prominence in the 1990s) on the Nickelodeon series &quot;Middlemost Post&quot; on the episode &quot;The Same Ol&#x27; Same&quot;.

==Collaborations==
In 1993, Del collaborated with the band Dinosaur Jr. to create the song &quot;Missing Link&quot;, featured on the &quot;Judgment Night&quot; soundtrack.
In 1999–2000, Del collaborated with Kid Koala and Dan the Automator as the supergroup Deltron 3030 whose debut self-titled album was released in May 2000. Exposure from the 3030 project helped to expand Del&#x27;s fan base—the 3030 project worked well as a marketing move because the CD capitalized on the growing interest of computer technology, incorporating motifs of science fiction, telling stories about life and hip hop based in the year 3030, and infusing much of the popular internet terminology and culture in circulation at the time.
A follow-up album, &quot;Event 2&quot;, was released in 2013. In 2005 Del worked with the Wu-Tang Clan and their affiliates on the collaboration album &quot;Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture&quot;.

Del collaborated with the virtual band Gorillaz on two songs on their debut album, &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and &quot;Rock the House&quot;, both of which became singles and videos and achieved chart success. Del was not, however, originally selected to collaborate on these songs. By the time Del came onto the project, the album was already finished, and British hip-hop group Phi Life Cypher had already recorded verses for &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;. But when Del finished making &quot;Deltron 3030&quot; with Dan the Automator, Dan asked if he could stay in the studio a little longer to record new verses for the Gorillaz songs. For the purposes of the music videos and the Gorillaz storyline canon, Del performed under the identity of &quot;Del the Ghost Rapper&quot;, who was said to be a spirit that was hiding from death within the band&#x27;s drummer, Russel Hobbs. Del later commented in an interview on the success of &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; by saying that he actually wrote the song with the book &quot;How to Write a Hit Song&quot;, a book that he bought with a coupon his mother gave him. After the song went platinum he gave the plaque to his mother. As part of Russel Hobbs&#x27; back-story, the character of Del was one of Russel&#x27;s friends that was gunned down in a drive-by shooting, whose ghost possessed Russel.

In 2009, Del is featured on the song &quot;Lothar&quot; by Sleep off his album &quot;Hesitation Wounds&quot;, as well as on the song &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot; by Gift of Gab off his album &quot;Escape 2 Mars&quot;. In March 2010, Del collaborated with independent pop/funk duo Modern Science on a track called &quot;Do It Right Now&quot; that is available on the band&#x27;s Bandcamp website. Del collaborated on the track &quot;Smoke Rings&quot; with Dirty Heads on their 2012 album &quot;Cabin by the Sea&quot;. In August 2012, Del appeared on the track &quot;The Ride&quot; from the EP &quot;Thrift Store Halos&quot; by ¡Mayday!.

In September 2013, Del appeared on two tracks from Figure&#x27;s &quot;Horns of the Apocalypse&quot; EP: &quot;Beast Mode&quot; and &quot;War Call&quot;. In January 2014, Del appeared on the track &quot;Viberian Son&quot; with MF Doom. In March 2014, Del appeared on the track &quot;Life and Time&quot; with Kool A.D. In 2016, Del was featured on the track &quot;World Renown&quot; with Mr. Lif&#x27;s album &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down&quot;. In April 2017, Del appeared (along with Carnage the Executor) on the track &quot;Lone Wolves&quot; from Cas One Vs Figure&#x27;s &quot;So Our Egos Don&#x27;t Kill Us&quot;. In 2017, Del was a guest artist on the debut album of Halo Orbit (a band featuring Juan Alderete, ex–Mars Volta and Mark Guiliana) on the track &quot;One Of These Days&quot;. He also appeared on the track &quot;Pizza Shop Extended&quot; from the album &quot;Iwasverybad&quot; by Jay IDK.

Using his Deltron persona, Del guests on the track &quot;3030 Meets the Doc, Pt. 1&quot; from Dr. Octagon&#x27;s &quot;Moosebumps: An Exploration Into Modern Day Horripilation&quot;. Released on streaming services April 6, 2018, the album reunites Kool Keith with Dan the Automator and DJ Qbert.

On July 7, 2018, as he was appearing with Gorillaz during the final act of the 2018 Roskilde Festival, Del fell off the stage during a performance of &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;. He was unable to get back up, and it was decided to cut the performance short. Although he was at first thought to have suffered only minor injuries, he had actually fractured seven ribs and punctured one of his lungs. He was still hospitalized in Roskilde four days after the accident. According to his Facebook page and official website, Del was back out touring in September 2018.

Del once again collaborated with Gorillaz in 2023, appearing on the &quot;Cracker Island&quot; deluxe edition bonus track &quot;Captain Chicken&quot;.

<text>The Anushtegin dynasty or Anushteginids (English: , ), also known as the Khwarazmian dynasty () was a Persianate Sunni Muslim dynasty of Turkic &quot;mamluk&quot; origin from the Bekdili clan of the Oghuz Turks. The Anushteginid dynasty ruled the Khwarazmian Empire, consisting in large parts of present-day Central Asia, Afghanistan and Iran in the approximate period of 1077 to 1231, first as vassals of the Seljuks and the Qara Khitai (Western Liao), and later as independent rulers, up until the Mongol conquest of the Khwarazmian Empire in the 13th century.

The dynasty was founded by commander Anushtegin Gharchai, a former Turkic slave of the Seljuq sultans, who was appointed as governor of Khwarazm. His son, Qutb ad-Din Muhammad I, became the first hereditary Shah of Khwarazm. Anush Tigin may have belonged to either the Begdili tribe of the Oghuz Turks or to Chigil, Khalaj, Qipchaq, Qangly, or Uyghurs.

==History==

The date of the founding of the Khwarazmian dynasty remains debatable. During a revolt in 1017, Khwarezmian rebels murdered Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Ma&#x27;mun and his wife, Hurra-ji, sister of the Ghaznavid sultan Mahmud. In response, Mahmud invaded and occupied the region of Khwarezm, which included Nasa and the &quot;ribat&quot; of Farawa. As a result, Khwarezm became a province of the Ghaznavid Empire from 1017 to 1034. In 1077, the governorship of the province, which since 1042/1043 belonged to the Seljuqs, fell into the hands of Anush Tigin Gharchai, a former Turkic slave of the Seljuq sultan. In 1141, the Seljuq Sultan Ahmed Sanjar was defeated by the Qara Khitai at the battle of Qatwan, and Anush Tigin&#x27;s grandson Ala ad-Din Atsiz became a vassal to Yelü Dashi of the Qara Khitan.

Sultan Ahmed Sanjar died in 1156. As the Seljuk state fell into chaos, the Khwarezm-Shahs expanded their territories southward. In 1194, the last Sultan of the Great Seljuq Empire, Toghrul III, was defeated and killed by the Khwarezm ruler Ala ad-Din Tekish, who conquered parts of Khorasan and western Iran. In 1200, Tekish died and was succeeded by his son, Ala ad-Din Muhammad, who initiated a conflict with the Ghurids and was defeated by them at Amu Darya (1204). Following the sack of Khwarizm, Muhammad appealed for aid from his suzerain, the Qara Khitai who sent him an army. With this reinforcement, Muhammad won a victory over the Ghurids at Hezarasp (1204) and forced them out of Khwarizm.

Ala ad-Din Muhammad&#x27;s alliance with his suzerain was short-lived. He again initiated a conflict, this time with the aid of the Kara-Khanids, and defeated a Qara-Khitai army at Talas (1210), but allowed Samarkand (1210) to be occupied by the Qara-Khitai. He overthrew the Karakhanids (1212) and Ghurids (1215). In 1212, he shifted his capital from Gurganj to Samarkand. Thus incorporating nearly the whole of Transoxania and present-day Afghanistan into his empire, which after further conquests in western Persia (by 1217) stretched from the Syr Darya to the Zagros Mountains, and from the northern parts of the Hindu Kush to the Caspian Sea. By 1218, the empire had a population of 5 million people.

<doc id="582463" wikidata="Q337276" url="?curid=582463" title="Sacha Guitry">
<text>Alexandre-Pierre Georges &quot;Sacha&quot; Guitry (; 21 February 188524 July 1957) was a French stage actor, film actor, director, screenwriter, and playwright of the boulevard theatre. He was the son of a leading French actor, Lucien Guitry, and followed his father into the theatrical profession. He became known for his stage performances, particularly in boulevardier roles. He was also a prolific playwright, writing 115 plays throughout his career. He was married five times, always to rising actresses whose careers he furthered. Probably his best-known wife was Yvonne Printemps to whom he was married between 1919 and 1932.

Guitry&#x27;s plays range from historical dramas to contemporary light comedies. Some have incidental music by composers including André Messager and Reynaldo Hahn. When silent films became popular Guitry avoided them, finding the lack of spoken dialogue fatal to dramatic impact. From the 1930s to the end of his life he enthusiastically embraced the cinema, making as many as five films in a single year.

The later years of Guitry&#x27;s career were overshadowed by accusations of collaborating with the occupying Germans after the capitulation of France in the Second World War. The charges were dismissed, but Guitry, a strongly patriotic man, was disillusioned by the vilification he received from some of his compatriots. By the time of his death, his popular esteem had been restored to the extent that 12,000 people filed past his coffin before his burial in Paris.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Guitry was born at No 12 Nevsky Prospect, Saint Petersburg, Russia, the third son of the French actors Lucien Guitry and his wife Marie-Louise-Renée &quot;née&quot; Delmas de Pont-Jest (1858–1902). The couple had eloped, in the face of family disapproval, and were married at St Martin in the Fields, London, in 1882. They then moved to the then Russian capital, where Lucien ran the French theatre company, the Théâtre Michel, from 1882 to 1891. The marriage was brief. Guitry senior was a persistent adulterer, and his wife instituted divorce proceedings in 1888. Two of their sons died in infancy (one in 1883 and the other in 1887); the other surviving son, Jean (1884–1920) became an actor and journalist. The family&#x27;s Russian nurse habitually shortened Alexandre-Pierre&#x27;s name to the Russian diminutive &quot;Sacha&quot;, by which he was known all his life. The young Sacha made his stage debut in his father&#x27;s company at the age of five.

Lucien Guitry, considered the most distinguished actor in France since Coquelin, was immensely successful, both critically and commercially. When he returned to Paris he lived in a flat in a prestigious spot, overlooking the Place Vendôme and the Rue de la Paix. The young Sacha lived there, and for his schooling he was first sent to the well-known Lycée Janson de Sailly in the fashionable Sixteenth arrondissement. He did not stay long there, and went to a succession of other schools, both secular and religious, before abandoning formal education at the age of sixteen.

After giving up school Guitry embarked on a career as a playwright with a little musical piece called &quot;Le Page&quot;, with a score by Ludo Ratz, premiered at the Théâtre des Mathurins on 15 April 1902. Eighteen months later he joined his father&#x27;s company at the Théâtre de la Renaissance. At first he appeared under the stage name &quot;Lorcey&quot;; the pseudonym deceived no-one, as the press immediately announced the debutant&#x27;s real identity. His first role was in &quot;L&#x27;Escalier&quot;, by Maurice Donnay in November 1904. He fell out with his father over what the latter saw as Guitry&#x27;s lack of professionalism. In the aftermath of their quarrel they neither saw nor spoke to one another.

A member of Lucien Guitry&#x27;s company was a young actress, Charlotte-Augustine-Hortense Lejeune, whose stage name was Charlotte Lysès (1877–1956). In April 1905, she and Sacha set up home together in the rue d&#x27;Anjou (now the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré). For her he wrote his play, &quot;Le KWTZ&quot;, premiered in December 1905 at the Théâtre des Capucins. In the same month he had his first substantial hit with &quot;Nono&quot; at the Mathurins. When the leading man in Guitry&#x27;s 1906 play &quot;Chez les Zoaques&quot; fell ill the author took over, and in the words of a critic, &quot;proved to be his own definitive interpreter&quot;. The pattern of his career was set: he remained an actor-author, and later manager, for the rest of his life.

===Rise to prominence===
For the next five years, Guitry&#x27;s plays were, at best, moderate successes, but he then had five consecutive hits with &quot;Le Veilleur de nuit&quot; (1911), &quot;Un Beau mariage&quot; (1912), &quot;Le Prise de Berg-op-Zoom&quot; (1912), &quot;La Pèlerine écossaise&quot; (1912), and &quot;Les Deux converts&quot; (1914), the last of which was staged by the Comédie-Française.

In 1915, Guitry made his first cinema film, &quot;Ceux de chez nous&quot; (&quot;Those of our home&quot;), a short patriotic piece that celebrated great French men and women of the day, including Sarah Bernhardt, Anatole France, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Auguste Rodin, Edmond Rostand and Camille Saint-Saëns. He was not greatly attracted by the medium of silent film, regarding dialogue as the essence of drama; he did not make a full-length film until 1935. In 1915, he met the young singer Yvonne Printemps, with whom he began an affair that led Charlotte to leave him and obtain a divorce. Guitry started to write leading roles for Printemps some musical and others straight comedies.

===With Printemps===
Guitry was reconciled with his father in 1918. Lucien appeared in many productions with his son and Printemps, including &quot;Mon Père avait raison&quot; and &quot;Comment on ecrit l&#x27;histoire&quot;. They played together not only in Paris, but in the West End of London. All three appeared at the Aldwych Theatre in a four-week season in 1920. Sir John Gielgud wrote that Printemps and her husband &quot;returned … many times to delight London in various pieces artfully contrived by him to show them both off to the best possible advantage.&quot;
Guitry developed a charming, witty stage persona, often appearing in period-dress light comedies, for instance his 1925 pastiche &quot;Mozart&quot;, about the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart on a visit to Paris. To compose the score he approached André Messager, with whom he had successfully collaborated in 1923 on a show for Printemps, &quot;L&#x27;amour masqué&quot;. Messager was unavailable and recommended the composer Reynaldo Hahn, who accepted the commission. The resulting production took some liberties with historical accuracy, but it proved highly popular. Printemps, in a breeches role, played and sang the young Mozart, with Guitry as the composer&#x27;s patron, Baron Grimm. Gielgud recalled, &quot;She seemed ravishingly youthful and touching in her powdered wig, black knee breeches and buckled shoes, while Sacha hovered over her with avuncular authority, not attempting to try to sing himself, but contributing a kind of flowing, rhythmic accompaniment with his speeches, delivered in a deep caressing voice.&quot; After playing successfully at the Théâtre Edouard VII, the company presented the piece for a three-week season in London in June and July 1926. After the London production, Guitry and Printemps took the piece to Broadway, Boston and Montreal in late 1926 and early 1927. They returned to the US and Canada in 1929.

In 1931, Guitry was awarded the Legion of Honour, and the following year he marked thirty years on the stage with a banquet, with dishes named after some of his greatest successes. Later in 1932, his marriage to Printemps broke up. He took a six-month break from the theatre, returning in April 1933 in &quot;Châteaux en Espagne&quot;, which co-starred his new &quot;protégée&quot;, Jacqueline Delubac, whom he married on his fiftieth birthday. During the 1930s, he turned his attention once more to the cinema, as writer, director and star, while not neglecting his theatrical career. Sheridan Morley comments that in 1936 alone Guitry made five films and also wrote five plays. Among the latter was his hundredth play, &quot;Le Mot de Cambronne&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1938, Guitry wrote a one-act play, &quot;Dieu sauve le roi&quot;, to mark the state visit to Paris of George VI; the play was given in front of the king and queen at the Elysée Palace. When President Lebrun made a reciprocal visit to London the following year, Guitry wrote a short comedy in English, &quot;You&#x27;re Telling Me&quot;, in which the author and Sir Seymour Hicks starred at a command performance and for a limited run after it.

As the war approached, Guitry managed to do something which would be of far greater significance. On 16 August 1939, when visiting London, Guitry smuggled over a replica Enigma machine supplied by the Biuro Szyfrow and bound for Bletchley Park.

His next play, &quot;Un Monde fou&quot; was his last to feature Delubac, who, in Morley&#x27;s phrase, &quot;could no longer bear living with a jealous workaholic&quot;. Within months of her leaving him, he married for a fourth time; his new wife was Geneviève de Séréville, who had been in the cast of his London play.

Guitry&#x27;s career was affected by the Nazi occupation of France. He continued to work both on stage and in the cinema under the Nazis. Although this gave him the opportunity to help many of his compatriots, it also brought accusations of collaborating with the enemy. He conceived his book and associated film, &quot;De 1429 à 1942 ou De Jeanne d&#x27;Arc à Philippe Pétain&quot; (&quot;1429 to 1942, or Joan of Arc to Philippe Pétain&quot;) as a tribute to France&#x27;s past glories, but many saw it as honouring the collaborationist president of Vichy France, Marshal Pétain. In 1944, Guitry&#x27;s fourth wife left him. In 1942, Guitry was named on a list of French collaborators with Germany to be killed during the war, or tried after it.

On the liberation of France, Guitry was among the first arrested, by a Resistance militia. He was interned in a detention camp at Drancy, and suffered ill-effects on his health that necessitated his transfer to a Paris nursing home. The criminal charges were dropped for lack of evidence, and the experience left him disillusioned.

In 1947, Guitry married for the fifth and final time; he was sixty-two and his bride, Lana Marconi, was twenty-eight. He was permitted to resume working in the theatre in 1948, when he returned to the Paris stage with &quot;Le Diable boiteux&quot;. For the London season in 1953, celebrating the coronation of Elizabeth II, Guitry starred at the Winter Garden in &quot;Ecoutez bien, messieurs&quot;, a comedy in which he played a voluble Frenchman reduced to baffled silence by an even more voluble Englishwoman, played (in English) by Heather Thatcher. Later in the same year he made his last stage appearance in Paris in &quot;Palsambleu&quot;. He continued to make films until 1957, when he suffered a disabling disease of the nervous system.

Guitry died in Paris at the age of seventy-two. Twelve thousand people filed past his coffin, and he was buried, like his father, in the Montmartre Cemetery, Paris.

==Legacy and reputation==

Critical re-assessment has been prompted by reissues of Guitry&#x27;s films. In 2011, an auction of Guitry memorabilia, including manuscripts, drawings, paintings and photographs, was held at the Drouot-Richelieu in Paris; with more than eight hundred items, it was considered the most important collection of material relating to Guitry since the playwright&#x27;s death.

In an obituary, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; commented:

<doc id="582467" wikidata="Q1427154" url="?curid=582467" title="Flannan Isles">
<text>The Flannan Isles () or the Seven Hunters are a small island group in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, approximately west of the Isle of Lewis. They may take their name from Saint Flannan, the 7th century Irish preacher and abbot.

The islands have been devoid of permanent residents since the automation of Flannan Isles Lighthouse in 1971.

==Geography==
The islands are split into three groups: the main cluster of rocks that lie to the northeast include the two principal islands of (Big Isle), which is approximately in extent, and (House Isle). To the south lie &quot;Soray/Soraigh&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Suðurey&quot;, south island or &quot;Sauðurey&quot;, sheep&#x27;s island) and (probably from Old Norse &quot;sker,&quot; skerry, shallow rock in sea, and Gaelic &quot;tuaman&quot;, grave or mound); while the main western outcrops are (Isle of the Blacksmith), &quot;Roaireim&quot; (which has a natural rock arch), and (Sad Sunk Rock). The total land area amounts to approximately and the highest point is above sea level on Eilean Mòr.
The geology consists of a dark breccia of gabbros and dolerites intruding Archaean gneiss. In prehistoric times, the area was covered by ice sheets that spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean. After the last retreat of the ice circa 20,000 years BP, sea levels were as much as lower than at present and it is likely that the existing islands were part of a much larger land mass, although still separated from the Outer Hebrides by many miles of open water. Steadily rising sea levels thereafter would have reduced the land remaining above sea level to its present extent.

There are two possible landing places for yachts visiting to the east and west, although this may be hazardous given the regular heavy swells.
==History==
As the name implies, Eilean Taighe hosts a ruined stone shelter. Eilean Mòr is home to the lighthouse and a ruined chapel dedicated to Saint Flannán, which the lighthouse keepers referred to as the &quot;dog kennel&quot; because of its small size. These ruined bothies were described collectively by the &quot;Ancient Monuments Commission&quot; as The Bothies of the Clan McPhail, or Bothain Chlann ‘ic Phaill.

It is not entirely clear to which St Flannan the chapel pays honours. It is likely that the honoree was either the 7th-century Abbot of Killaloe, County Clare, Ireland, or alternatively, the half brother of the eighth century St Ronan, who gave his name to the nearby island of North Rona. There was also a certain Flann, son of an Abbot of Iona, called Maol-duine, who died in 890 and may also have lent his name to these isolated isles.
The archipelago is also known as &quot;The Seven Hunters&quot;. During the Middle Ages, they also may have been called the &quot;Seven Haley (Holy) Isles&quot;. Martin Martin (1703) lists a number of unusual customs associated with regular pilgrimages to Eilean Mòr, such as removing one&#x27;s hat and making a sunwise turn when reaching the plateau.

==Wildlife==

The isles provide nesting for a population of seabirds, including Atlantic puffins, northern fulmars, European storm-petrels, Leach&#x27;s petrels, common shag, and black-legged kittiwakes. There is a gannetry on Roaireim. From the late Middle Ages on, Lewismen regularly raided these nests for eggs, birds, and feathers. There is a population of rabbits, brought to the islands by the lighthouse keepers, and crofters from Bernera graze sheep on the most fertile islands. Minke and pilot whales, as well as Risso&#x27;s and other species of dolphin, are commonly observed in the vicinity.

The islands became a Site of Special Scientific Interest in December 1983.

The archipelago has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports breeding populations of several species of seabirds.

==Lighthouse crew disappearance==

In December 1900, all three lighthouse keepers vanished in mysterious circumstances. An official inquiry concluded that the three men had probably been swept away and lost at sea in rough weather while attending some equipment near the cliff edge.

==In fiction==
The Flannan Isles are the main setting in Robert W. Sneddons&#x27;s short story &quot;On the Isle of Blue Men&quot; which was first published in &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; magazine in April 1927. The Scottish-American author&#x27;s &quot;atmospheric, Lovecraftian thriller&quot; was reissued by Charles G. Waugh with an alternate ending based on an older story by Sneddon in the &quot;Lighthouse Horrors&quot; anthology in 1993. Neil Gunn&#x27;s epic novel &quot;The Silver Darlings&quot; published in 1941 describes a visit to the islands. Eilean Mòr in particular also features prominently as the location of a murder central to the plot of &quot;Coffin Road&quot;, a 2016 novel by Peter May.

&quot;The Vanishing&quot;, a 2019 film starring Gerard Butler and Peter Mullan, is set on the isles and inspired by the infamous disappearances.

The Flannan Isles feature as one of the locations in ‘Never Let Me Down Again’, a novel by Mark Dawson which is one of his series of John Milton novels.

It is the setting of Alan K. Baker&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;The Lighthouse Keeper&quot; (2012), with a storyline inspired by the 1900 disappearance of the crew.

, a turn-based tactical role-playing game, features a side story that takes place in the Flannan Isles and is based on the lighthouse keepers&#x27; disappearances.

<text>Thomas Kent (; 29 August 1865 – 9 May 1916) was an Irish nationalist who was court-martialled and executed following a gunfight with the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) on 9 May 1916, in the immediate aftermath of the Easter Rising.

==Easter Rising==
Kent was part of a prominent nationalist family who lived at Bawnard House, Castlelyons, County Cork. They were prepared to take part in the Easter Rising, but when the mobilisation order was countermanded, they stayed at home. The rising nevertheless went ahead in Dublin, and the RIC was sent to arrest well-known sympathizers throughout the country, including known members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, Sinn Féin, and the Irish Volunteers. When the Kent residence was raided they were met with resistance from Thomas and his brothers Richard, David and William. A gunfight lasted for four hours, in which an RIC officer, Head Constable William Rowe, was killed and David Kent was seriously wounded. Eventually, the Kents were forced to surrender, although Richard made a last minute dash for freedom and was fatally wounded.

==Trial and execution==
Thomas and William Kent were tried by court martial on the charge of armed rebellion. William was acquitted, but Thomas was sentenced to death. David Kent was brought to Dublin where he was charged with the same offence, found guilty and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted and he was sentenced to five years penal servitude. Thomas Kent was executed by firing squad in Cork on 9 May 1916, the only person outside of Dublin to be shot for his role in the events surrounding Easter Week (Roger Casement was hanged for treason in London). Kent was buried in the grounds of Cork Prison, formerly the Military Detention Barracks at the rear Collins Barracks, Cork (formerly Victoria Barracks). The former army married quarters to the rear of Collins Barracks are named in his honour.

==State funeral==
Taoiseach Enda Kenny offered a state funeral to the Kent family early in 2015, which they accepted. Kent&#x27;s remains were exhumed from Cork prison in June 2015 after being buried for 99 years. 
The analysis of Kent&#x27;s remains, which had been found in a shallow, quicklime-filled grave, involved the State Pathologist&#x27;s Office, the National Forensic Coordination Office at the Garda Technical Bureau, Forensic Science Ireland, and scientists from University College Dublin, and the scientific team was led by Dr. Jens Carlsson from the University of California-Davis. The State funeral was held on 18 September 2015 at St Nicholas&#x27; Church in Castlelyons. Kent lay in state at Collins Barracks in Cork the day before. The requiem mass was attended by President Michael D. Higgins, with Enda Kenny delivering the graveside oration.

==Memorials==

The main railway station in Cork, Kent Station was named after Thomas Kent in 1966.

The bridge over the River Blackwater in Fermoy, County Cork, where Thomas Kent was detained following his arrest, was named after him and his brothers in 2016.

<doc id="582473" wikidata="Q507032" url="?curid=582473" title="Oogenesis">
<text>Oogenesis () or ovogenesis is the differentiation of the ovum (egg cell) into a cell competent to further develop when fertilized. It is developed from the primary oocyte by maturation. Oogenesis is initiated before birth during embryonic development.

==Oogenesis in non-human mammals==
In mammals, the first part of oogenesis starts in the germinal epithelium, which gives rise to the development of ovarian follicles, the functional unit of the ovary.

Oogenesis consists of several sub-processes: oocytogenesis, ootidogenesis, and finally maturation to form an ovum (oogenesis proper). Folliculogenesis is a separate sub-process that accompanies and supports all three oogenetic sub-processes.

Oogonium —(Oocytogenesis)—&gt; Primary Oocyte —(Meiosis I)—&gt; First Polar body (Discarded afterward) + Secondary oocyte —(Meiosis II)—&gt; Second Polar Body (Discarded afterward) + Ovum

Oocyte meiosis, important to all animal life cycles yet unlike all other instances of animal cell division, occurs completely without the aid of spindle-coordinating centrosomes.

===The creation of oogonia===
The creation of oogonia traditionally does not belong to oogenesis proper, but, instead, to the common process of gametogenesis, which, in the female human, begins with the processes of folliculogenesis, oocytogenesis, and ootidogenesis. Oogonia enter meiosis during embryonic development, becoming oocytes. Meiosis begins with DNA replication and meiotic crossing over. It then stops in early prophase.

===Maintenance of meiotic arrest===
Mammalian oocytes are maintained in meiotic prophase arrest for a very long time—months in mice, years in humans. Initially, the arrest is due to lack of sufficient cell cycle proteins to allow meiotic progression. However, as the oocyte grows, these proteins are synthesized, and meiotic arrest becomes dependent on cyclic AMP. The cyclic AMP is generated by the oocyte by adenylyl cyclase in the oocyte membrane. The adenylyl cyclase is kept active by a constitutively active G-protein-coupled receptor known as GPR3 and a G-protein, Gs, also present in the oocyte membrane.

Maintenance of meiotic arrest also depends on the presence of a multilayered complex of cells, known as a follicle, that surrounds the oocyte. Removal of the oocyte from the follicle causes meiosis to progress in the oocyte. The cells that comprise the follicle, known as granulosa cells, are connected to each other by proteins known as gap junctions, that allow small molecules to pass between the cells. The granulosa cells produce a small molecule, cyclic GMP, that diffuses into the oocyte through the gap junctions. In the oocyte, cyclic GMP prevents the breakdown of cyclic AMP by the phosphodiesterase PDE3, and thus maintains meiotic arrest. The cyclic GMP is produced by the guanylyl cyclase NPR2.

===Reinitiation of meiosis and stimulation of ovulation by luteinizing hormone===

As follicles grow, they acquire receptors for luteinizing hormone, a pituitary hormone that reinitiates meiosis in the oocyte and causes ovulation of a fertilizable egg. Luteinizing hormone acts on receptors in the outer layers of granulosa cells of the follicle, causing a decrease in cyclic GMP in the granulosa cells. Because the granulosa cells and oocyte are connected by gap junctions, cyclic GMP also decreases in the oocyte, causing meiosis to resume. Meiosis then proceeds to second metaphase, where it pauses again until fertilization. Luteinizing hormone also stimulates gene expression leading to ovulation.


==Human oogenesis==
===Oogenesis===
Oogenesis starts with the process of developing primary oocytes, which occurs via the transformation of oogonia into primary oocytes, a process called oocytogenesis. From one single oogonium, only one mature oocyte will rise, with 3 other cells called polar bodies. Oocytogenesis is complete either before or shortly after birth. 

====Number of primary oocytes====
It is commonly believed that, when oocytogenesis is complete, no additional primary oocytes are created, in contrast to the male process of spermatogenesis, where gametocytes are continuously created. In other words, primary oocytes reach their maximum development at ~20 weeks of gestational age, when approximately seven million primary oocytes have been created; however, at birth, this number has already been reduced to approximately 1-2 million per ovary. At puberty, the number of oocytes decreases even more to reach about 60,000 to 80,000 per ovary, and only about 500 mature oocytes will be produced during a woman&#x27;s life, the others will undergo atresia (degeneration). Two publications have challenged the belief that a finite number of oocytes are set around the time of birth generation in adult mammalian ovaries by putative germ cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood. The renewal of ovarian follicles from germline stem cells (originating from bone marrow and peripheral blood) has been reported in the postnatal mouse ovary. In contrast, DNA clock measurements do not indicate ongoing oogenesis during human females&#x27; lifetimes.
Thus, further experiments are required to determine the true dynamics of small follicle formation.

===Ootidogenesis===
The succeeding phase of ootidogenesis occurs when the primary oocyte develops into an ootid. This is achieved by the process of meiosis. In fact, a primary oocyte is, by its biological definition, a cell whose primary function is to divide by the process of meiosis.

However, although this process begins at prenatal age, it stops at prophase I. In late fetal life, all oocytes, still primary oocytes, have halted at this stage of development, called the dictyate. After menarche, these cells then continue to develop, although only a few do so every menstrual cycle.

====Meiosis I====
Meiosis I of ootidogenesis begins during embryonic development, but halts in the diplotene stage of prophase I until puberty. The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) stage actively repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair is not detectable in the pre-dictyate (leptotene, zygotene and pachytene) stages of meiosis. For those primary oocytes that continue to develop in each menstrual cycle, however, synapsis occurs and tetrads form, enabling chromosomal crossover to occur. As a result of meiosis I, the primary oocyte has now developed into the secondary oocyte.

====Meiosis II====
Immediately after meiosis I, the haploid secondary oocyte initiates meiosis II. However, this process is also halted at the metaphase II stage until fertilization, if such should ever occur. If the egg is not fertilized, it is disintegrated and released (menstruation) and the secondary oocyte does not complete meiosis II (and does not become an ovum). When meiosis II has completed, an ootid and another polar body have now been created. The polar body is small in size.

=== Ovarian cycle ===
The ovarian cycle is divided into several phases:

* Follicologenesis: Synchronously with ootidogenesis, the ovarian follicle surrounding the ootid has developed from a primordial follicle to a preovulatory one. The primary follicle takes four months to become a preantral, two months to become antral, and then passes to a mature (Graaf) follicle. The primary follicle has oocyte-lining cells that go from floor to cubic and begin to proliferate, increasing the metabolic activity of the oocyte and follicular cells, which release glycoproteins and proteoglycans acids that will form the zona pellucida, which accompany the installation. In the preantral secondary follicle, internal and external theca cells begin to form. Aromatase, produced by follicular cells, transforms androgens produced by the inner theca into estrogens under the stimulation of FSH. LH stimulates theca cells to produce androgens. In the antral follicle, there is an antrum containing a follicle liquor, which contains estrogen, to allow the passage from the antral follicle to the Graaf follicle. The follicular antrum moves the oocyte and becomes eccentric; the oocyte is always surrounded by the pellucid zone and by follicular cells that form the oophorus cumulus. The innermost ones are called radiated corona cells. At this stage, the oocyte produces cortical granules containing acid glycoproteins. 
* Dominant follicle selection: The follicle with more FSH receptors will be more favored, simultaneously inducing the death of the other follicles (3-10 antral follicles that enter this phase each month). Low concentration estrogen will inhibit further production of FSH by the pituitary gland with negative feedback, so the follicles left behind will accumulate in the follicular antrum instead of androgens.
* Graaf follicle: Estrogen at other concentrations induces LH release, with the peak of LH called LH surge, which induces stages that will lead to follicle burst. LH receptors also appear on follicular cells, which stimulate the oocyte to become a secondary oocyte, blocked in metaphase, waiting for fertilization. LH also stimulates oophore cumulus cells to release progesterone.
* Ovulation: bursting of the follicle, oocyte leakage with pellucid zone, and radiated corona cells. The lining membrane is thinned on the ovary where the follicle bursts and the cells attached to it emerge from the stigma. The ovary is collected from the uterine tube, where fertilization can take place in the ampullate zone. 
* Formation of the corpus luteum: From the remaining structures of the follicle, the corpus luteum is formed. At first, there is a clot, which is then replaced by loose connective tissue; the cells that form solid cords are follicular cells and cells of the outer theca (Tecali lutein cells) and internal (granulosa cells). The luteal body increases the concentration of progesterone, which LH constantly stimulates. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum degenerates (body albicans); if it is implanted, it remains until three months of pregnancy, where its function is replaced by the placenta (production of progesterone and estrogen). The level of LH (necessary to keep the corpus luteum alive) is replaced by human chorionic gonadotropin.

=== Uterine cycle ===
The uterine cycle occurs parallel to the ovarian cycle and is induced by estrogen and progesterone. The endometrium, formed by a monostratified cylindrical epithelium, with uterine glands (simple tubular), connective with a functional superficial layer (divided into a spongy layer, a compact layer, and a deeper basal layer, which is always maintained, presents four phases:

* Proliferative phase: From the 5th to the 14th day of the ovarian cycle, it is conditioned by estrogens. The functional layer of the uterus is restored, with mitotic division of the basal layer.
* Secretive phase: from the 14th to the 27th day of the ovarian cycle, influenced by the progesterone produced by the corpus luteum. Cells become hypertrophic, and tubular glands begin to produce glycogen
* Ischemic phase: beginning of the menstrual phase from 27 to 28 days
*  Regressive or desquamative phase from 1 to 5 days, the spiral-shaped arteries undergo ischemia, and the functional layer detaches

If, instead, there is fertilization, the uterine mucosa is modified to accommodate the fertilized egg, and the secretive phase is maintained.

===Maturation into ovum===
Both polar bodies disintegrate at the end of Meiosis II, leaving only the ootid, which then eventually undergoes maturation into a mature ovum.

The function of forming polar bodies is to discard the extra haploid sets of chromosomes that have resulted as a consequence of meiosis.

===In vitro maturation===
&quot;In vitro maturation&quot; (&quot;IVM&quot;) is the technique of letting ovarian follicles mature in vitro. It can potentially be performed before an IVF. In such cases, ovarian hyperstimulation is not essential. Rather, oocytes can mature outside the body prior to IVF. Hence, no (or at least a lower dose of) gonadotropins have to be injected in the body. Immature eggs have been grown until maturation &quot;in vitro&quot; at a 10% survival rate, but the technique is not yet clinically available. With this technique, cryopreserved ovarian tissue could possibly be used to make oocytes that can directly undergo in vitro fertilization.

===In vitro oogenesis===
By definition it means, to recapitulate mammalian oogenesis and producing fertilizable oocytes in vitro.it is a complex process involving several different cell types, precise follicular cell-oocyte reciprocal interactions, a variety of nutrients and combinations of cytokines, and precise growth factors and hormones depending on the developmental stage. In 2016, two papers published by Morohaku et al. and Hikabe et al. reported in vitro procedures that appear to reproduce efficiently these conditions allowing for the production, completely in a dish, of a relatively large number of oocytes that are fertilizable and capable of giving rise to viable offspring in the mouse. This technique can be mainly benefited in cancer patients where in today&#x27;s condition their ovarian tissue 
is cryopreserved for preservation of fertility. Alternatively to the autologous transplantation, the development of culture systems that support oocyte development from the primordial follicle stage represent a valid strategy to restore fertility. Over time, many studies have been conducted with the aim to optimize the characteristics of ovarian tissue culture systems and to better support the three main phases: 1) activation of primordial follicles; 2) isolation and culture of growing preantral follicles; 3) removal from the follicle environment and maturation of oocyte cumulus complexes. While complete oocyte in vitro development has been achieved in mouse, with the production of live offspring, the goal of obtaining oocytes of sufficient quality to support embryo development has not been completely reached into higher mammals despite decades of effort.

==Ovarian aging==
BRCA1 and ATM proteins are employed in repair of DNA double-strand break during meiosis. These proteins appear to have a critical role in resisting ovarian aging. However, homologous recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks mediated by BRCA1 and ATM weakens with age in oocytes of humans and other species. Women with BRCA1 mutations have lower ovarian reserves and experience earlier menopause than women without these mutations. Even in woman without specific BRCA1 mutations, ovarian aging is associated with depletion of ovarian reserves leading to menopause, but at a slower rate than in those with such mutations. Since older premenopausal women ordinarily have normal progeny, their capability for meiotic recombinational repair appears to be sufficient to prevent deterioration of their germline despite the reduction in ovarian reserve. DNA damages may arise in the germline during the decades long period in humans between early oocytogenesis and the stage of meiosis in which homologous chromosomes are effectively paired (dictyate stage). It has been suggested that such DNA damages may be removed, in large part, by mechanisms dependent on chromosome pairing, such as homologous recombination.

==Oogenesis in non-mammals==

Some algae and the oomycetes produce eggs in oogonia. In the brown alga &quot;Fucus&quot;, all four egg cells survive oogenesis, which is an exception to the rule that generally only one product of female meiosis survives to maturity.

In plants, oogenesis occurs inside the female gametophyte via mitosis. In many plants such as bryophytes, ferns, and gymnosperms, egg cells are formed in archegonia. In flowering plants, the female gametophyte has been reduced to an eight-celled embryo sac within the ovule inside the ovary of the flower. Oogenesis occurs within the embryo sac and leads to the formation of a single egg cell per ovule.

In &quot;ascaris&quot;, the oocyte does not even begin meiosis until the sperm touches it, in contrast to mammals, where meiosis is completed in the estrus cycle.

In female &quot;Drosophila&quot; flies, genetic recombination occurs during meiosis. This recombination is associated with formation of DNA double-strand breaks and the repair of these breaks.
 The repair process leads to crossover recombinants as well as at least three times as many noncrossover recombinants (e.g. arising by gene conversion without crossover).

<text>María África Gracia Vidal&lt;ref name=&quot;garafia.es/maria-montez&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (6 June 1912 – 7 September 1951), known professionally as Maria Montez, was a Dominican actress who gained fame and popularity in the 1940s starring in a series of filmed-in-Technicolor costume adventure films. Her screen image was that of a seductress, dressed in fanciful costumes and sparkling jewels. She became so identified with these adventure epics that she became known as The Queen of Technicolor. Over her career, Montez appeared in 26 films, 21 of which were made in North America, with the last five being made in Europe.

Montez was born María África Gracia Vidal (some sources cite María Antonia Gracia Vidal de Santo Silas, María África Antonia Gracia Vidal de Santo Silas or Maria Antonia Africa Gracia Vidal da Santo Sila as her birth name) in Barahona, Dominican Republic. Educated at the Sacred Heart Convent in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain, she was the second&lt;ref name=&quot;elboletinnoticioso/maria-montez&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of ten children (Isidoro Gracia Vidal, Aquilino Gracia Vidal&lt;ref name=&quot;myheritage/MaríaGraciaVidal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) born to Isidoro Gracia y García,&lt;ref name=&quot;elapuron/montez-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;elapuron/montez-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a Spaniard, from Garafía,&lt;ref name=&quot;eldia/Reina-technicolor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain, and Regla María Teresa Vidal y Recio, a Dominican of Criollo descent, although it is unclear how many survived into adulthood.

In the mid-1930s, her father was appointed to the Spanish consulship in Belfast, Northern Ireland where the family moved. It was there that Montez met her first husband, William G. McFeeters, whom she married at age 17.

&quot;A finales de 1929, con 17 años, su padre la internó en un colegio de religiosas de Tenerife con la intención de que olvidara a un cincuentón del que se había enamorado. Pero en octubre de 1930, la actriz regresó a su tierra natal y reanudó sus relaciones con el banquero irlandés William G. MacFeeters, con el que terminaría casándose en 1932.&quot;

Montez learned English and was educated at a Catholic convent school in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnsur.com.do/2022/06/06/maria-montez&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
On 3 July 1939, Montez arrived in New York. Her first job, for $50, was for the cover of a magazine.

Montez was spotted by a film talent scout in New York. Her first film was &quot;Boss of Bullion City&quot; (1940), a Johnny Mack Brown western produced by Universal Pictures. This was the first film where she played a leading role and the only role where she speaks some Spanish.

Her next film role was in &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; (1940). It was made for Universal Pictures, who signed her to a long-term contract starting at $150 a week.

She had small decorative roles in two films with the comedy team of Richard Arlen and Andy Devine, &quot;Lucky Devils&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Desert&quot;; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said she &quot;was attractive as the oasis charmer&quot; in the latter. She also appeared in &quot;Moonlight in Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Bombay Clipper&quot;. She had a small part in &quot;That Night in Rio&quot; (1941), made at 20th Century Fox.

Universal did not have a &quot;glamour girl&quot; like other studios, an equivalent to Hedy Lamarr (MGM), Dorothy Lamour (Paramount), Betty Grable (20th Century Fox), Rita Hayworth (Columbia), or Ann Sheridan (Warner Bros). They decided to groom Maria Montez to take on this role, and she received a lot of publicity. Montez was also a keen self-promoter.&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/books/montez&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/maria-montez&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; &quot;she borrowed an old but sure-fire technique to get ahead in the movies. She acted like a movie star. She leaned on the vampish tradition set up by Nazimova and Theda Bara... She went in heavily for astrology. Her name became synonymous with exotic enchantresses in sheer harem pantaloons.&quot; She took on a &quot;star&quot; pose in her private life. One newspaper called her &quot;the best commissary actress in town... In the studio cafe, Maria puts on a real show. Always Maria makes an entrance.&quot;

In June 1941 Montez&#x27;s contract with Universal was renewed. She graduated to leading parts with &quot;South of Tahiti&quot;, co-starring Brian Donlevy. She also replaced Peggy Moran in the title role of &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; (1942). Public response to &quot;South of Tahiti&quot; was enthusiastic enough for the studio to cast Montez in her first starring part, &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. She claimed in 1942 she was making $250 a week.

===&quot;Arabian Nights&quot; and stardom===

&quot;Arabian Nights&quot; was a prestigious production for Universal, its first shot in three-strip Technicolor, produced by Walter Wanger and starring Montez, Jon Hall, and Sabu. The resulting film was a big hit and established Montez as a star.

Montez wanted to portray Cleopatra, but instead Universal reunited her with Hall and Sabu in &quot;White Savage&quot; (1943) (where Montez was upped from second-billing to top-billing). They went on to make a third film, &quot;Cobra Woman&quot; (1944). All three were audience favorites.

In 1943 Montez was awarded two medals from the Dominican government for her efforts in promoting friendly relations between the US and her native land.

Universal wanted three more films starring Montez, Hall, and Sabu. Sabu, however, was drafted into the US Army and so was replaced by Turhan Bey in &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot; (1944). Hall, Montez, and Bey were meant to reunite in &quot;Gypsy Wildcat&quot; (1944), but Bey was required on another film and ended up being replaced by Peter Coe. &quot;Sudan&quot; (1945) starred Montez, Hall, and Bey, with Bey as Montez&#x27;s romantic interest this time.

&quot;Flame of Stamboul&quot; was another proposed Hall-Bey-Montez film but it was postponed. Universal also announced that Montez would play Elisabeth of Austria in &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot;, based on a story by Bertita Harding, but it was never made. She did appear in &quot;Follow the Boys&quot;, Universal&#x27;s all-star musical, and &quot;Bowery to Broadway&quot;.

In 1944 Montez said that the secret to her success was that she was &quot;sexy but sweet...I am very easy to get along with. I am very nice. I have changed a lot during the last year. I have outgrown my old publicity. I used to say and do things to shock people. That was how I became famous. But now it is different. First the public likes you because you&#x27;re spectacular. But after it thinks you are a star it wants you to be nice. Now I am a star, I am nice.&quot;

===Conflicts with Universal===
Montez said she was &quot;tired of being a fairy tale princess all the time&quot; and wanted to learn to act. She fought with Universal for different, more varied parts.

&quot;&quot;Sudan&quot; is making more money than the others and Universal thinks on that account I should appear in more of these films&quot;, she said. &quot;But I want to quit these films when they are at a peak, not on the downbeat. It isn&#x27;t only that the pictures are all the same, but the stories are one just like the other.&quot;

Montez was suspended for refusing the lead in &quot;Frontier Gal&quot;; her role was taken by Yvonne De Carlo, who had become a similar sort of star like Montez and began to supplant the latter&#x27;s position at the studio.

In 1946 Montez visited France with Aumont and both became excited about the prospect of making films there. In particular, Aumont negotiated rights to the book &quot;Wicked City&quot; and Jean Cocteau wanted to make a film with both. Aumont says they were determined to get out of their respective contracts in Hollywood and move to France.

Universal put Montez in a modern-day story, &quot;Tangier&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Flame of Stamboul&quot;; it reunited her with Sabu, although not with Jon Hall, who was by then serving in the US Army. There was some talk Montez would star in &quot;The Golden Fleece&quot; project (as &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;), produced independently with Aumont co-starring. The King Brothers reportedly offered her $150,000 plus 20% of the profits to appear in &quot;The Hunted&quot;. Neither film was made. Instead Montez appeared in a Technicolor western for Universal, &quot;Pirates of Monterey&quot; (1947) with Rod Cameron.

In February 1947 she and Aumont started filming a fantasy adventure, &quot;Siren of Atlantis&quot; (1948) for a fee of 100,000. In April she was borrowed by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. to appear in the sepia-toned swashbuckler &quot;The Exile&quot; (1948), directed by Max Ophüls, produced by Fairbanks but released by Universal. Fairbanks Jr. says Montez wanted to play the role over the objections of Universal; she later insisted on top billing despite the small nature of the role. In August 1947 Universal refused to pick up their option on Montez&#x27; contract, and she went freelance. Montez sued Universal for $250,000 over the billing issue; the matter was settled out of court. In February 1948 Universal reported Montez has earned $78,375 that year.

===Freelance career===

In 1947 Hedda Hopper announced Montez and her husband would make &quot;The Red Feather&quot; about Jean Lafitte. She was also announced for &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;, this time not the Elizabeth of Austria project but an adaptation of a European play by Louis Verneuil, &quot;Cousin from Warsaw&quot;. Neither film was made.

&quot;Siren of Atlantis&quot; ended up requiring re-shoots and was not fully released until 1949. It proved unsuccessful at the box office in the US (although it performed respectfully in France and other parts of Europe). Montez later successfully sued the producer for $38,000 in unpaid contractual funds.

Montez endorsed Max Factor Cosmetics, Jergens Lotion, Deltah Pearls,&lt;ref name=&quot;nevadacoinmart/imperial-pearls&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imperialpearl/Company-history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Lux Soap, and Woodbury Powder.

===European career===
Montez and Aumont formed their own production company, Christina Productions. They moved to a home in Suresnes, Île-de-France in the western suburb of Paris, under the French Fourth Republic. According to Aumont, they were going to star in &quot;Orpheus&quot; (1950), which Aumont says Jean Cocteau wrote for him and Montez. However, the filmmaker decided to use other actors instead.

In July 1948 Montez and Aumont made &quot;Wicked City&quot; (1949) for Christina Productions with Villiers directing and Aumont contributing to the script. It was one of the first US-French co productions after the Second World War. Christina provided the services of Aumont, Montez, and Lilli Palmer; in exchange Christina&#x27;s share would be paid off first out of US receipts.

Aumont had begun writing plays and Montez appeared in the one-woman production, &quot;L&#x27;lle Heureuse&quot; (&quot;The Happy Island&quot;); reviews were poor, however. Her next film was &quot;Portrait of an Assassin&quot; (1949), which was meant to feature Orson Welles but ended up co-starring Arletty and Erich von Stroheim.

In September 1949 it was announced Montez would make &quot;The Queen of Sheba&quot; with Michael Redgrave for director François Villiers; the film was not made, however.

Montez appeared in an Italian swashbuckler, &quot;The Thief of Venice&quot; (1950), with a Hollywood director, John Brahm. Again in Italy, she was in &quot;Love and Blood&quot; (1951), followed by another co-starring her husband, &quot;Revenge of the Pirates&quot; (1951). This would be the last feature she ever made.

Montez also wrote three books, two of which were published, as well as penning a number of poems.

At the time of her untimely death, Montez&#x27;s US agent, Louis Shurr, was planning her return to Hollywood to appear in a new film, &quot;Last Year&#x27;s Show&quot;, to be made for Fidelity Pictures.

==Personal life==
Montez was married twice. Her first marriage was to William Gourley Macfeeters,&lt;ref name=&quot;ancestry/24-cjdsjw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=0-5vEAAAQBAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=Z6Wvv6d4ZO8C&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;geni/6000000036621465293&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the agent for Barahona of the First National City Bank of New York,&lt;ref name=&quot;mariamontez/bio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a banker who had served in the British Army. They married 28 November 1932,&lt;ref name=&quot;nndb/883/000136475&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; when Montez was 20 years old, they lived in Barahona, Dominican Republic,&lt;ref name=&quot;mariamontez.org/ibarahona2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced in 1939. Her second husband Jean-Pierre Aumont described him as &quot;an Irishman who was naive enough to think he could lock her up in some frosty castle.&quot; For more than a year, Montez was reportedly engaged to Claude Strickland, a flight officer with the RAF whom she met in New York. However, it was later revealed that this was just a publicity stunt.

While working in Hollywood, Montez met French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont. Aumont later wrote &quot;to say that between us it was love at first sight would be an understatement&quot;. They married on 14 July 1943 at Montez&#x27;s home in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;calisphere/Montez-Aumont&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Boyer was Aumont&#x27;s best man and Jannine Crispin was Montez&#x27;s matron of honour. According to Aumont &quot;it was a strange house. You didn&#x27;t answer the phone or read the mail; the doors were always open. Diamonds were left around like ashtrays. &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; lay between two issues of movie magazines. An astrologer, a physical culture expert, a priest, a Chinese cook, and two Hungarian masseurs were part of the furnishings. During her massage sessions, Montez granted audiences.&quot;

Aumont had to leave a few days after wedding Montez to serve in the Free French Forces which were fighting against Nazi Germany in the European Theatre of World War II. At the end of World War II, the couple had a daughter, Maria Christina (also known as Tina Aumont), born in Hollywood on 14 February 1946. In 1949 Aumont announced that they would get divorced but they remained together until Montez&#x27;s death.

==Death==
The 39-year-old Montez died in Suresnes, France, on 7 September 1951 after apparently suffering a heart attack and drowning while taking a hot bath.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/Montez-Dies-Suddenly&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.

She left the bulk of her $200,000 estate (more than $2 million in 2021 dollars) to her husband and their five-year-old daughter.

==Legacy==

From the Dominican Republic, Montez received two decorations: the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit in the Grade of Officer and the Order of Trujillo in the same grade, presented to her by President Rafael Leónidas Trujillo in November, 1943. In 1944, she was named Goodwill Ambassador of Latin American countries to the United States in the so-called Good Neighbor policy. In 2009 the Santo Domingo metro in the Dominican Republic named their main terminus Station Maria Montez.

Shortly after her death, a street in the city of Barahona, Montez&#x27;s birthplace, was named in her honor. In 1996, the city of Barahona opened the Aeropuerto Internacional María Montez (María Montez International Airport) in her honor. In 2012, a station on Line 2 of the Santo Domingo Metro was named in her honor.

In 1976, Margarita Vicens de Morales published a series of articles in the Dominican newspaper &quot;Listín Diario&quot;&#x27;s magazine &quot;Suplemento&quot;, where she presented the results of her research on Montez&#x27;s life. The research culminated in 1992 with the publication of the biography &quot;Maria Montez, Su Vida&quot;. After the first edition, a second edition was published in 1994, and a third followed in 2004.

In 1995, Montez was awarded the International Posthumous Cassandra, which was received by her daughter, Tina Aumont. In March 2012, the Casandra Awards were dedicated to Montez to commemorate the centenary of her birth.
The American underground filmmaker Jack Smith idolized Montez as an icon of camp&lt;ref name=&quot;48hills/camp-exotica&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; style. He wrote an aesthetic manifesto titled &quot;The Perfect Filmic Appositeness of Maria Montez&quot;, and made elaborate homages to her films in his own, including his notorious &quot;Flaming Creatures&quot; (1963).

The Spanish authors Terenci Moix and Antonio Perez Arnay wrote a book entitled &quot;Maria Montez, The Queen of Technicolor&quot; that recounted her life and reviewed her films.

The Dominican painter Angel Haché included in his collection &quot;Tribute to Film&quot;, a trilogy of Maria Montez and another Dominican painter, Adolfo Piantini, who dedicated a 1983 exhibit to her that included 26 paintings made using different techniques.

Dalia Davi, Puerto Rican actress from the Bronx, created the 2011 play &quot;The Queen of Technicolor Maria Montez&quot;. Davi wrote, directed, and starred in the play.

The journalist and Dominican actress Celinés Toribio stars as Montez in the 2015 film &quot;Maria Montez: The Movie&quot;, which she also executive produced.

In 1998, the TV show &quot;Mysteries and Scandals&quot; made an episode about Maria Montez. Montez is a key character in Gore Vidal&#x27;s 1974 novel &quot;Myron&quot;, his sequel to &quot;Myra Breckenridge&quot;. Montez is mentioned by name in &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;, both the play (1968) and the film (1970).

<text>The United States men&#x27;s national soccer team (USMNT) represents the United States in men&#x27;s international soccer. The team is governed by the United States Soccer Federation, which is a member of FIFA since 1914 and was a founding member of CONCACAF since 1961. It was also affiliated with NAFC, which was a predecessor confederation of CONCACAF and the governing soccer body in North America from 1946 to 1961.

The U.S. has appeared in eleven FIFA World Cups, including the first in 1930, where they reached the semifinals; their third-place finish, which was later awarded through overall tournament records, is the best result by a team from outside UEFA and CONMEBOL. They returned in 1934 and 1950, defeating England 1–0 in the latter, but did not qualify again until 1990. As host in 1994, the U.S. received an automatic berth and lost to Brazil in the round of 16. They qualified for the next five World Cups, a feat shared with only seven other nations. The U.S. reached the quarterfinals at the 2002 World Cup, and eliminated top-ranked Spain in the 2009 Confederations Cup semifinals before losing to Brazil in the final.

The United States also competes in continental tournaments, including the CONCACAF Gold Cup, CONCACAF Nations League and Copa América. The U.S. has won seven Gold Cups, three Nations League titles, and finished fourth in two Copa América editions in 1995 and 2016.

==History==

===Early years===

The first United States national soccer team was constituted on November 28, 1885, when it played Canada in the first international match held outside the United Kingdom. Canada defeated the U.S. 1–0 at Clark Field in the East Newark neighborhood of Kearny, New Jersey. A second match in East Newark the following year resulted in the U.S. defeating Canada 1–0, although neither match was officially recognized. The U.S. earned both silver and bronze medals in men&#x27;s tournament at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis through Christian Brothers College and St. Rose Parish, though the tournament is declared official only by the IOC; FIFA does not endorse tournaments held before 1908. The U.S. played its first official international match under the auspices of U.S. Soccer on August 20, 1916, against Sweden in Stockholm, where the U.S. won 3–2.

The U.S. fielded a team in the 1930 World Cup in Uruguay, the first edition of the World Cup. The U.S. began group play by beating Belgium 3–0, and then earned a 3–0 victory over Paraguay, with FIFA crediting Bert Patenaude with two of the goals. In November 2006, FIFA announced that it had accepted evidence that Patenaude scored all three goals against Paraguay, and was thus the first person to score a hat-trick in a World Cup. In the semifinals, the U.S. lost to Argentina 6–1 and were eliminated. There was no third place game; however, using the overall tournament records in 1986, FIFA credited the Americans with a third-place finish ahead of fellow semifinalist Yugoslavia. This remains the U.S. team&#x27;s best World Cup result, and is the highest finish of any team from outside of South America and Europe.

The U.S. qualified for the 1934 World Cup by defeating Mexico 4–2 in Italy a few days before the tournament opened. In a straight knock-out format, the team first played host Italy and lost 7–1, eliminating the U.S. from the tournament. At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, the U.S. lost 1–0 to Italy in the first round and were eliminated. Italy went on to win both tournaments.

The 1950 World Cup in Brazil was the next World Cup appearance for the United States, as it withdrew in 1938 and the tournament was not held again until 1950 due to World War II. The U.S. lost its first match 3–1 against Spain, but then won 1–0 against England at Independência Stadium in Belo Horizonte. Striker Joe Gaetjens was the lone goalscorer in the match, which was called &quot;The Miracle on Grass&quot; and considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of the World Cup. The U.S. were eliminated from the tournament in their third game, a 5–2 defeat to Chile.

===1960s–1980s===

The national team spent the mid-to-late 20th century in near complete irrelevance in both the international game and the domestic sporting scene. CONCACAF had only one World Cup berth until 1982. Playing only two matches from 1981 to 1983, U.S. Soccer targeted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1986 World Cup to rebuild the national team and its fan base. The International Olympic Committee declared that teams from outside Europe and South America could field full senior teams. The U.S. finished with a 1–1–1 record in the group stage of the tournament but did not qualify for the second round, losing to Egypt on a tiebreaker.

To provide a more stable national team program and renew interest in the North American Soccer League, U.S. Soccer entered the national team into the NASL league schedule for the 1983 season as Team America. This team lacked the continuity and regularity of training that conventional clubs enjoy, and many players were unwilling to play for the national team instead of their own clubs when conflicts arose. Team America finished the season at the bottom of the league, with U.S. Soccer canceling the experiment and withdrawing the national team from the NASL after one season. By the end of 1984, the NASL had folded, leaving the U.S. without a single professional-level outdoor soccer league.

The 1986 World Cup was hosted by Mexico after Colombia withdrew from contention due to economic concerns and the United States lost their subsequent bid to host. In the last game of CONCACAF qualifying for the 1986 World Cup, the U.S. needed only a tie against Costa Rica to reach the final qualification group against Honduras and Canada. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game to be played in Torrance, California, an area with many Costa Rican expatriates, and marketed the game almost exclusively to the Costa Rican community. Costa Rica won the match 1–0, and kept the U.S. from reaching its fourth World Cup finals.

===1990s===
On July 4, 1988, FIFA named the U.S. as the host of the 1994 World Cup under significant international criticism given the perceived weakness of the national team and the lack of a professional outdoor league. The success of the 1984 Olympics played a role in FIFA&#x27;s decision. The U.S. qualified for the 1990 World Cup with a 1–0 win against Trinidad and Tobago in the last match of the 1989 CONCACAF Championship. Mexico had been disqualified from the CONCACAF Championship for using ineligible players in a youth tournament, which allowed a chance for the U.S. to qualify for their first World Cup in 40 years.

The team was coached by Bob Gansler, Wisconsin-Milwaukee and U20 national team coach, in preparation for the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Two of the team&#x27;s more experienced players, Rick Davis and Hugo Perez, were unavailable for selection while recovering from injuries. Rather than fill out his team with veteran professionals from U.S. indoor soccer leagues, Gansler and his assistant Stejem Mark chose to select many younger players with better conditioning for the outdoor game, including several collegiate players such as Virginia goalkeeper Tony Meola. The U.S. entered the tournament as major underdogs and lost all three of its group games to Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Austria. Defenders Jimmy Banks and Desmond Armstrong became the first African Americans to appear in a World Cup match for the United States.

During the 1993 U.S. Cup, a tournament designed to prepare for the upcoming World Cup, the U.S. beat England 2–0. After qualifying automatically as the host of the 1994 World Cup under Bora Milutinović, the U.S. opened the tournament schedule with a 1–1 tie against Switzerland in the Pontiac Silverdome in the suburbs of Detroit, the first World Cup game played indoors. In its second game, the U.S. faced Colombia, then ranked fourth in the world, at the Rose Bowl near Los Angeles. Aided by an own goal from Andrés Escobar, the U.S. won 2–1; Escobar was later murdered in his home country, possibly in retaliation for this mistake. Despite a 1–0 loss to Romania in its final group game, the U.S. made it past the initial round for the first time since 1930. In the round of 16, the U.S. lost 1–0 to the eventual champion Brazil. U.S. Soccer later fired Milutinović in 1995 because he was reportedly not interested in administrative duties in addition to coaching.

The U.S. were invited to play in the 1995 Copa América, where they finished first in their group after defeating Chile and Argentina in an upset victory. In the quarterfinals, the U.S. defeated Mexico on penalties, and then lost to Brazil 1–0 in the semifinals. The United States finished fourth after losing to Colombia in the third-place match.

In the 1998 World Cup in France, the team lost all three group matches, 2–0 to Germany, 2–1 to Iran, and 1–0 to Yugoslavia, finishing last in the field of 32. The tournament was marred by disputes between the players and head coach Steve Sampson, who resigned shortly after the tournament.

===2000s===
Under former D.C. United head coach Bruce Arena, the U.S. qualified for the 2002 World Cup and reached the quarterfinals, their best finish in a World Cup since 1930. The team earned four points in the group stage, beginning with a 3–2 win over Portugal, followed by a 1–1 tie with co-host and eventual semifinalist South Korea. The third and final match was a 3–1 loss to Poland; the team still advanced to the round of 16 when South Korea defeated Portugal. The U.S. met continental rivals Mexico for the first time in a World Cup, and won the game 2–0, with goals from Brian McBride and Landon Donovan. In the quarterfinals, the USMNT met Germany and lost 1–0 after being controversially denied a penalty when Torsten Frings handled the ball to prevent a Gregg Berhalter goal. Donovan won the Best Young Player for the tournament.

In the 2006 World Cup, after finishing top of the CONCACAF qualification tournament, the U.S. was drawn into Group E along with the Czech Republic, Italy, and Ghana. The United States opened the tournament with a 3–0 loss to the Czech Republic. The team then tied 1–1 against eventual winners Italy, and then were knocked out of the tournament when they were beaten 2–1 by Ghana in its final group match, with Clint Dempsey scoring the U.S.&#x27;s only goal in the tournament (the goal against Italy had been an own goal by Italian defender Cristian Zaccardo). Following the tournament, Arena&#x27;s contract was not renewed; his assistant, former Chicago Fire and MetroStars head coach Bob Bradley, became interim head coach in December 2006 and was selected for the full-time role in May 2007.

After winning the 2007 Gold Cup against Mexico, the USMNT qualified for the 2009 Confederations Cup. The U.S. shocked the soccer world by defeating top-ranked Spain, who were on a 35-game undefeated streak, 2–0. With the win, the United States advanced to its first-ever final in a men&#x27;s FIFA tournament. The team lost 3–2 to Brazil after leading 2–0 at half-time. Hosting the 2009 Gold Cup, the United States was beaten by Mexico 5–0 in the final; this defeat broke the U.S. team&#x27;s 58-match home unbeaten streak against CONCACAF opponents, and was the first home loss to Mexico since 1999 and their first home loss in a competitive match since 1998.

In the fourth round of the 2010 World Cup qualification, Jozy Altidore became the youngest U.S. player to score a hat-trick, in a 3–0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago. On October 10, 2009, the U.S. secured qualification to the 2010 World Cup with a 3–2 win over Honduras. Four days later, the U.S. finished in first place in the final round of qualification with a 2–2 tie against Costa Rica.

===2010s===
In the 2010 World Cup, the USMNT was drawn into Group C against England, Slovenia and Algeria. After drawing against England 1–1 and Slovenia 2–2, the U.S. defeated Algeria 1–0 with a stoppage-time goal from Landon Donovan, taking first place in a World Cup group for the first time since 1930. In the round of 16, the U.S. was eliminated by Ghana, 2–1.

After losing to Mexico 4–2 in the final of the 2011 Gold Cup, Bob Bradley was relieved of his duties and former Germany manager Jürgen Klinsmann was hired as head coach. The U.S. won 1–0 in Genoa, Italy on February 29, 2012, the team&#x27;s first-ever win over Italy. In July 2013, the United States became North American champions for the fifth time after winning the Gold Cup with a 1–0 victory over Panama in the final, with Landon Donovan winning the tournament&#x27;s golden ball award. A 4–3 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina in an international friendly match in Sarajevo represented the 12th consecutive win for the USMNT, the longest active winning streak for any team in the world at that time. The winning streak ended September 6, when the U.S. lost to Costa Rica 3–1 in San José in the final round of qualification. The U.S. eventually clinched a spot in the 2014 World Cup.

The Americans were drawn into Group G, along with Ghana, Germany, and Portugal. The U.S. won 2–1 in their rematch with Ghana, and then tied their second group game against Portugal 2–2. In the final game of the group stage, the U.S. fell to Germany 1–0, but moved on to the knockout stage on goal difference. This was the first time that the team made two consecutive trips to the knockout stage of the FIFA World Cup. In the round of 16, the U.S. lost 2–1 to Belgium in extra time, despite goalkeeper Tim Howard making a World Cup record 15 saves during the match.
In the 2015 Gold Cup, the U.S. were eliminated by Jamaica 2–1 in the semifinals, before losing to Panama on penalties in the third place match. It marked the first time the team failed to make the tournament final since 2003. In the 2015 CONCACAF Cup playoff to determine the region&#x27;s entry to the 2017 Confederations Cup, the U.S. were defeated 3–2 by Mexico at the Rose Bowl. The results led to criticism of Klinsmann&#x27;s coaching style, particularly the lack of a cohesive identity.

In June 2016, the U.S. hosted the Copa América Centenario, a special edition of the Copa América to commemorate the centenary of the tournament and its first to be played outside of South America. In their third Copa América appearance, the U.S. topped Group A on goal difference against Colombia despite losing to them, and then beat Ecuador 2–1 in the quarterfinals. The team lost 4–0 to Argentina in the semifinals and 1–0 to Colombia again in the third place match. The U.S. finished fourth overall, tying their best finish ever in 1995.

Following consecutive losses to Mexico and Costa Rica in the opening games of the final round of qualification for the 2018 World Cup, Klinsmann was removed as national team coach and technical director and replaced by previous U.S. head coach Bruce Arena. World Cup qualification resumed on March 24, 2017, where Arena and his team achieved a record 6–0 win over Honduras. The U.S. earned their third ever result in World Cup qualification at the Estadio Azteca when they drew 1–1 against Mexico. In July 2017, the U.S. won their sixth Gold Cup with a 2–1 win over Jamaica in the final. Following a 2–1 defeat to Trinidad and Tobago on October 10, 2017, the U.S. failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, missing the tournament for the first time since 1986. Many pundits and analysts called this the worst result and worst performance in the history of the national team.

Following Arena&#x27;s resignation on October 13, 2017, assistant coach Dave Sarachan was named interim head coach during the search for a permanent replacement. The search for a permanent head coach was delayed by the USSF presidential election in February 2018 and the hiring of Earnie Stewart as general manager in June 2018. Gregg Berhalter, coach of the Columbus Crew and a former USMNT defender, was announced as the team&#x27;s new head coach on December 2, 2018.

Under Berhalter the team lost in the 2019 Gold Cup final 1–0 against Mexico and were unable to defend their title.

===2020s===
An influx of new young talent playing for top European clubs, widely described as America&#x27;s golden generation, entered the national team in the late 2010s and early 2020s, including Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams, Timothy Weah, Sergiño Dest, and Gio Reyna. This new group won the inaugural CONCACAF Nations League in 2021 with a 3–2 victory against Mexico in the final. A different roster won the Gold Cup against Mexico later that summer, contributing to a record for wins in a calendar year, with 17 wins, three ties, and two losses in 2021.

The United States qualified for the 2022 World Cup by finishing third in the final qualifying round. Grouped with England, Iran, and Wales in Group B, the team advanced to the knockout stage as runners-up with five points and without losing a game. There, they faced the Netherlands and were defeated 3–1. Midfielder Kellyn Acosta became the first Asian American player to appear for the U.S. at a World Cup.

After Berhalter&#x27;s contract expired in December 2022, the U.S. searched for a new head coach. Under interim manager B.J. Callaghan in June 2023, the United States successfully defended their Nations League trophy by winning the 2022–23 CONCACAF Nations League. The team conceded no goals in the finals tournament, winning 3–0 against Mexico and 2–0 against Canada in the final match. Callaghan remained the team&#x27;s manager for the 2023 Gold Cup the following month, which was played with a different roster. The U.S. were eliminated in the semifinals by Panama after losing a penalty shootout.

The United States automatically qualified for the 2026 World Cup as co-host in February 2023, and secured a spot at the U.S.-hosted 2024 Copa América by defeating Trinidad and Tobago 4–2 over two legs in November 2023. Gregg Berhalter was reappointed as coach of the United States on June 16, 2023. In March 2024, the United States won their third CONCACAF Nations League title by defeating Mexico 2–0 in the final. At the Copa América, the United States were eliminated in the group stage, with a 1–0 loss in the final group stage match against Uruguay involving several controversial decisions against the Americans from referee Kevin Ortega, including a potentially offside Uruguay goal and handling of yellow cards. Following the team&#x27;s elimination, Berhalter was fired as head coach on July 10, 2024.

On September 10, 2024, Todd Boehly and the USMNT&#x27;s delegates agreed to an undisclosed exit fee for former Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino, and Pochettino would subsequently be announced as the new head coach of the United States, replacing Berhalter.

=== Uniform and crest ===
Since their first unofficial game against Canada, the most common U.S. uniform has been white tops with blue shorts. A variant with a diagonal stripe or &quot;sash&quot; across the shirt similar to Peru&#x27;s jersey was first adopted in 1950 and used in various uniforms in the 2000s. A color scheme based on the U.S. flag—usually a shirt with red and white stripes with blue shorts—has been occasionally used (most prominently in the 1994 World Cup and 2012–13 qualifiers as well the 1983 Team America franchise of the North American Soccer League).

German brand Adidas provided the uniform for the United States from 1984 to 1994. Since 1995, American company Nike has been the uniform supplier. The final Adidas jersey was a denim-inspired blue shirt with white stars paired with red shorts.

===Rivalries===
====Mexico====
The United States and Mexico have been the most successful teams in CONCACAF and are major rivals.

The two countries first met in 1934 during a World Cup qualifier in Rome that the U.S. won; Mexico won the following 24 meetings and were perennial qualifiers for the World Cup. Since 1980, the U.S. has had more wins against Mexico, particularly in home matches and major tournaments. They faced off in the round of 16 of the 2002 World Cup, with the United States winning 2–0. On August 15, 2012, the U.S. defeated Mexico at Estadio Azteca in the first victory for the Americans on Mexican soil in 75 years. On October 10, 2015, Mexico defeated the U.S. 3–2 in the CONCACAF Cup in Pasadena, California to qualify for the 2017 Confederations Cup. Thirteen months later, on November 11, 2016, El Tri defeated the U.S. in Columbus, Ohio for their second consecutive victory on American soil, in qualification for the 2018 World Cup. In 2021, the United States defeated Mexico three times in a calendar year for the first time, winning the CONCACAF Nations League final, the Gold Cup final, and in 2022 World Cup qualifying.

Ever since their first meeting in 1934, the two teams have met 78 times, with Mexico leading 37W–17T–24L, outscoring the U.S. 147–92. However, because of recent growth of soccer in the U.S., since the beginning of the 21st century, the U.S. leads the series 19W–8T–10L. Either the United States or Mexico has won every edition of the Gold Cup except one (the 2000 Gold Cup was won by Canada).

====Canada====
The U.S. has a secondary rivalry with Canada, with the rivalry stemming from a generally friendly rivalry between the two countries. The United States has historically been the stronger side, having qualified for 11 World Cups while Canada has qualified for two.

On October 15, 2019, Canada defeated the United States for the first time in 34 years, at BMO Field in Toronto. In 2022 World Cup qualifying, Canada tied 1–1 with the U.S. in Nashville, Tennessee, and defeated the USMNT 2–0 in Hamilton, Ontario. On June 18, 2023, the United States defeated Canada 2–0 in the CONCACAF Nations League final in Las Vegas. The U.S. defeated Canada yet again in a 2023 Gold Cup quarterfinal matchup, this time 3–2 on penalties, in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The United States currently leads the series at 18W–11T–11L.

====Costa Rica====

In the 2010s, the United States began to develop a rivalry with Costa Rica. The impetus for the rivalry was a 2014 World Cup qualifying match played on March 22, 2013, at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado under blizzard conditions. Costa Rica filed a protest with FIFA due to field conditions after the United States won the game 1–0, but were denied recourse. The game was dubbed &quot;Snow Clasico&quot; for the conditions. The United States have never won an away match in Costa Rica, losing 10 meetings and drawing twice.

===Supporters===
There have been two main supporter groups backing U.S. Soccer teams, Sam&#x27;s Army and The American Outlaws. Sam&#x27;s Army started shortly after the 1994 World Cup and were active through 2014. Sam&#x27;s Army members wore red to matches and sung or chanted throughout the match, and often brought huge U.S. flags and other banners to the game.

The American Outlaws began in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2007 as a local supporters&#x27; group. The group&#x27;s membership attempted to address a lack of consistency from game to game in supporter organization and social events on match days.

The U.S. men&#x27;s national team has a major following on social media platforms. Interest in young American players and the attention they bring has led to an increase in foreign investment in U.S. players, soccer development programs, and sports clubs.

===Home stadium===

The United States does not have a dedicated national stadium like other national teams; instead, the team has played their home matches at various venues across the country. , the team has played in 123 stadiums in 30 states and the District of Columbia. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, located in the national capital of Washington, D.C., has hosted 24 matches, the most of any stadium. The state of California has hosted 117 matches, the most of any state, and greater Los Angeles has hosted 79 matches at several venues in and around the city of LA. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosted 20 matches from 1965 to 2000. The Rose Bowl, a 92,000-seat venue in Pasadena, has hosted 17 national team matches, as well as the 1984 Olympics gold medal match, the 1994 World Cup final, and the 1999 Women&#x27;s World Cup final.

==Competitive record==

The United States has competed at the FIFA World Cup, the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the CONCACAF Nations League, and the Summer Olympics. The team has also played in the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, the Copa América, as well as several minor tournaments.

The best result for the United States in a World Cup tournament came in 1930 when it reached the semifinals. The team included six naturalized internationals, five of them from Scotland and one from England. In the modern era, the team&#x27;s best result came in 2002, when it reached the quarterfinals. Its worst World Cup tournament results in were group-stage eliminations in 1990, 1998, and 2006; the team failed to qualify altogether for the final tournament in 2018. The United States reached the round of 16 in 1994, 2010, 2014, and 2022.

In the Confederations Cup, the United States finished in third place in both 1992 and 1999, and were runner-up in 2009. The team appeared in its first intercontinental tournament final at the 2009 Confederations Cup, where it lost to Brazil 3–2 after leading 2–0 at halftime.

The U.S. men&#x27;s soccer team first played in the Summer Olympics in 1924. From that tournament to 1980, only amateur and state-sponsored Eastern European players were allowed on Olympic teams. The Olympics became a full international tournament in 1984 after the IOC allowed full national teams from outside FIFA&#x27;s strongest confederations of UEFA and CONMEBOL. Since 1992 the men&#x27;s Olympic event has been age-restricted, to those 23 years and younger, with the exception (since 1996) of up to three overage players; participation has been by the United States men&#x27;s national under-23 soccer team.

In regional competitions, the United States has won the CONCACAF Gold Cup seven times, with its most recent title in 2021. The team has won all three CONCACAF Nations League editions that have been played so far, including the inaugural 2021 final. Its best finish at the Copa América was fourth place at the 1995 and 2016 editions, while it competed as the host nation in 2024, failing to advance past the group stage.

<doc id="582489" wikidata="Q17090273" url="?curid=582489" title="Middle East Policy Council">
<text>The Middle East Policy Council (MEPC) is a Washington, D.C.-based 501(c)3 non-profit organization that produces analysis and commentary on issues impacting U.S. national interests in the Middle East. It was founded in 1981 under the stated mission to &quot;expand public discussion and understanding of issues affecting U.S. policy in the Middle East.&quot; 

MEPC was originally named the American-Arab Affairs Council and was co-founded by journalist Richard Curtiss, who later founded the &quot;Washington Report on Middle East Affairs,&quot; and George Naifeh, who remained president of the MEPC until 1991. Naifeh was an American diplomat who represented the United States in diplomatic missions in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia over nearly three decades.

Subsequent presidents include George McGovern (1991-1997) and Charles W. Freeman Jr. (1997-2009). Frank Anderson was the president of the MEPC from 2009 to April 2012. Anderson served in the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for 26 years. He served three tours of duty in the Middle East as an agency station chief, headed the Afghan Task Force (1987–89), and was chief of the Near East and South Asia Division. In late 2013 the MEPC board appointed Ford M. Fraker president. Following Fraker&#x27;s death, Richard J. Schmierer was elected president of the council in 2017.

== Programs ==
The Council advances its mission through three programs: the quarterly journal &quot;Middle East Policy,&quot; the Capitol Hill Conference Series for policy makers and their staff, and professional development workshops for educators through the &quot;TeachMideast&quot; arm.

According to the Council web site:

&quot;Fresh thinking and new insights have been our stock in trade from the beginning. The policy practitioners, analysts, economists and academics appearing in our venues have provided a wide diversity of views on the region stretching from Morocco to Afghanistan and from Central Asia to Oman. They question conventional wisdom and explain complex issues without oversimplifying them.&quot;

Established in 1993, the Capitol Hill Conference Series is aimed at members of Congress and their staffs, opinion leaders and members of the media. According to the Council web site &quot;the starting point for each forum is the same: What are the interests of the United States in the Middle East, and how should they be realized?&quot;

Recent Capitol Hill Conferences include:

* &quot;Changes and Challenges in Israeli &amp; Palestinian Leadership&quot; (7/16/2021)
* &quot;The Impact of Climate Change on the Middle East&quot; (4/23/2021)
* &quot;Middle East Policy in Transition: Issues for the 117th Congress &amp; New Administration&quot; (1/29/2021)
* &quot;Arab-Israeli Relations on the Eve of the U.S. Election&quot; (10/23/2020)
* &quot;Progress or Conflict? What to Expect for U.S. Policy in the Middle East&quot; (7/17/2020)
* &quot;The Middle East in 2020&quot; (4/17/2020)
* &quot;U.S. - Iranian Confrontation: Domestic, Regional and Global Implications&quot;(1/17/2020)
* &quot;The United States, Israel, and Palestine: An Assessment&quot; (10/25/19)
* &quot;The United States - Saudi Arabian Relationship&quot; (7/19/19)
* &quot;The Future of U.S. Engagement in the Middle East&quot; (4/12/19)
* &quot;The Trump Administration&#x27;s Middle East Policies: A Mid-term Assessment&quot; (1/25/19)

Video archives from these events are available on the MEPC website and the events are streamed live.

Since 1985, the workshops of &quot;TeachMideast&quot; have been conducted in nearly all fifty U.S. states, reaching over 20,000 teachers.

The Contributor Dialogue Series was introduced in spring of 2021 to explore Middle East Policy Journal articles through interviewing different authors of compelling pieces. Recent Contributor Dialogues include: 

* &quot;Permission to Narrate a Pandemic in Palestine&quot; (7/29/2021) Executive Director Bassima Alghussein interviews Bram Wispelwey, Rania Muhareb, Mads Gilbert and David Mills. 
* &quot;Iran&#x27;s Regional Dynamics: A Piecemeal Approach&quot; (6/24/2021) Executive Director Bassima Alghussein interviews Dr. Banafsheh Keynoush.
* &quot;Democrats’ Attitudes toward the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict&quot; (5/20/2021) Executive Director Bassima Alghussein interviews Dr. Jonathan Rynhold.

== Other content ==
In addition to featuring its journal articles, videos, and transcripts from the Capitol Hill Conferences, the MEPC web site houses various book reviews and essays written by scholars and members of the MEPC board. The council also shares a recurring feature series, &quot;Middle East In Focus&quot;, that provides a synopsis of news and commentary from Middle Eastern and other international media. This survey complements a digest of timely articles from the region also available on the web site. In 2011, Senior fellow Mark N. Katz contributed a weekly series, &quot;The War on Terror in Perspective&quot;, where he addressed &quot;the regional impact of American withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. policy choices after withdrawing from these conflicts, and the broader geopolitical context in which &#x27;war&#x27; takes place.&quot; Political risk analyst Ian Siperco has also contributed articles regarding political developments in the region.

==Funding==

In expressing alarm over former MEPC president Chas Freeman&#x27;s nomination to the National Intelligence Council (NIC) in early 2009, &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; contributing editor Michael Goldfarb claimed that MEPC funds from Saudi Arabia were for &quot;the funding of a Saudi lobby that could widen the range of debate, i.e. counter the Israel lobby.&quot; Mr. Goldfarb&#x27;s phrase &quot;Saudi lobby&quot; referred to an article by &quot;Washington Times&quot; writer Eli Lake where he wrote that &quot;Since 1997, Mr. Freeman has been president of the Middle East Policy Council (MEPC), a Washington think tank. In 2007, he accepted a $1 million donation from Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al-Saud that, according to a press release at the time, was meant for &quot;future projects&quot; for the council.&quot; Mr. Lake went on to write that &quot;In an interview in 2006 with the Saudi-U.S. Relations Information Service, Mr. Freeman said, &#x27;These are obviously very difficult times for any organization attempting to promote better understanding and stronger ties between the United States and the Arab world. Attitudes are extremely negative. Financial support has been very negatively affected both by the deterioration in the atmosphere [and] the sense on the part of many of our Arab donors that nothing can be done to fix the negative image of the Arabs in the United States at present.&#x27; The interview was publicized in 2009 on the blog of a former foreign policy director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Steve J. Rosen.&quot;

According to non-profit disclosure forms, The Middle East Policy Council&#x27;s 2007 total receipts were $731,000.

<doc id="582497" wikidata="Q448477" url="?curid=582497" title="Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps">
<text>The sergeant major of the Marine Corps (officially abbreviated to SMMC)&lt;ref name=&quot;ALMAR 016/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a billet, as well as a unique enlisted grade of rank, and is designated a special paygrade above E-9. The position also has a unique non-commissioned grade of rank insignia, in the United States Marine Corps. The holder of this rank and position is the most senior enlisted marine in the Marine Corps, unless an enlisted marine is serving as the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman, which is the case as of November 3, 2023.

==History==
In the U.S. Marine Corps, sergeant major is the ninth and highest enlisted rank, just above first sergeant, and equal in grade to master gunnery sergeant, although the two have different responsibilities. A sergeant major typically serves as the unit commander&#x27;s senior enlisted adviser and handles matters of discipline and morale among the enlisted Marines. The Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps is chosen by the commandant of the Marine Corps to serve as his adviser and is the preeminent and highest-ranking enlisted Marine unless an enlisted marine is serving as the senior enlisted advisor to the Chairman. The SMMC holds an order of precedence of a lieutenant general.

Although not officially considered a Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, when Archibald Sommers was appointed to Sergeant Major on January 1, 1801, it was a solitary post, similar to the modern billet of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps. In 1833, an act of legislation made the rank of sergeant major permanent for the Marine Corps, and by 1899 five Marines held the rank of sergeant major. This continued until 1946, when the rank was abolished, only to be re-introduced in 1954 as part of the Marine Corps rank structure.

The post of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps was established in 1957 from the order of Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel at Headquarters Marine Corps, Brigadier General James P. Berkeley, as the senior enlisted advisor to the commandant of the Marine Corps, the first such post in any of the five branches of the United States Armed Forces. In 1970, the rank insignia of the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps was authorized (which features three stripes, the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor flanked by two five-point stars in the center, and four rockers) as opposed to the standard Sergeant Major rank insignia (which features three stripes, one five-point star in the center, and four rockers), which was used for the rank from the post&#x27;s creation in 1957 to 1970. While &quot;Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps&quot; is the full wording of the rank, the verbal address for this is common &quot;Sergeant Major&quot;.

The commandant of the Marine Corps selects the sergeant major of the Marine Corps and typically serves a four-year term, though his service is at the discretion of the Commandant. Since Sergeant Major Wilbur Bestwick was appointed the first Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in 1957, 20 different Marines have filled this post.

<doc id="582500" wikidata="Q261456" url="?curid=582500" title="Delphine Seyrig">
<text>Delphine Claire Beltiane Seyrig (; 10 April 1932 – 15 October 1990) was a Lebanese-born French actress and film director. She came to prominence in Alain Resnais&#x27;s 1961 film &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;, and later acted in films by Chantal Akerman, Luis Buñuel, Marguerite Duras, Ulrike Ottinger, François Truffaut, and Fred Zinneman. She directed three films, including the documentary &quot;Sois belle et tais-toi&quot; (1981).

==Early life==

Seyrig was born into an intellectual Protestant family. Her Alsatian father, Henri Seyrig, was the director of the Beirut Archaeological Institute and later France&#x27;s cultural attaché in New York during World War II. Her mother, , was Swiss, and the niece of linguist/semiologist Ferdinand de Saussure.

Delphine was the sister of composer . Her family moved from Lebanon to New York City when she was ten. When the family returned to Lebanon in the late 1940s, she was sent to school at the Collège Protestant de Jeunes Filles, which had been founded by Protestant pacifists and social justice activists in 1938. She attended the school from 1947 to 1950. 

==Career==

As a young woman, Seyrig studied acting at the Comédie de Saint-Étienne, training under Jean Dasté, and at Centre Dramatique de l&#x27;Est. She appeared briefly in small roles in the 1954 TV series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. In 1956, she returned to New York and studied at the Actors Studio. In 1959, she appeared in her first film, &quot;Pull My Daisy&quot; (short). In New York she met director Alain Resnais, who asked her to star in his film &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; (1961). Her performance brought her international recognition and she moved to Paris. Among her roles of this period is the older married woman in François Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; (1968).

During the 1960s and 1970s, Seyrig worked with directors including Truffaut, Luis Buñuel, Marguerite Duras, and Fred Zinnemann, as well as Resnais. She achieved recognition for both her stage and film work, and was named best actress at the Venice Film Festival for her role in Resnais&#x27; &quot;Muriel&quot; (1963). She played many diverse roles, and because she was fluent in French, English and German, she appeared in films in all three languages, including a number of Hollywood productions.

Seyrig may be most widely known for her role as Colette de Montpellier in Zinnemann&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;. In turn, perhaps her most demanding role was in Chantal Akerman&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles&quot;, in which she was required to adopt a highly restrained, rigorously minimalistic mode of acting to convey the mindset of the title character.

Seyrig was a major feminist figure in France. Throughout her career, she used her celebrity status to promote women&#x27;s rights. The most important of the three films she directed was the 1977 &quot;Sois belle et tais-toi (Be Pretty and Shut Up)&quot;, which included actresses Shirley MacLaine, Maria Schneider, and Jane Fonda, speaking frankly about the level of sexism they had to deal with in the film industry. She also directed with Carole Roussopoulos an adaptation of the SCUM Manifesto by Valerie Solanas.

==&quot;Les Insoumuses&quot;==
Seyrig, Carole Roussopoulos, and translator Ioana Wieder, formed the feminist video collective &quot;&quot; in 1975, after meeting at a video-editing workshop that Roussopoulos organized in her apartment. The name &quot;Les Insoumuses&quot; is a neologism combining &quot;insoumise&quot; (disobedient) and &quot;muses&quot;. The collective produced several videos together, focusing on representations of women in the media, labour, and reproductive rights.

In 1982, Seyrig was a key member of the group that established the Paris-based , which maintains a large archive of women&#x27;s filmed and recorded work and produces work by and about women. In 1989, Seyrig was given a tribute at the Créteil International Women&#x27;s Film Festival.

== Personal life ==

Seyrig married (and was later divorced from) American painter Jack Youngerman (1926–2020), who had studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Their son Duncan (b. 1956, Paris) is a musician and composer working in both France and the United States. Seyrig&#x27;s granddaughter, Selina Youngerman, is a working actress based in London.

In 1971, Seyrig signed the Manifesto of the 343, publicly declaring she had had an illegal abortion. She was the unrequited love of Anglo-French actor, Michael Lonsdale.

Seyrig died in a French prison on October 15, 1990, from lung cancer, aged 58.

<doc id="582505" wikidata="Q269409" url="?curid=582505" title="Murray Halberg">
<text>Sir Murray Gordon Halberg (7 July 1933 – 30 November 2022) was a New Zealand middle-distance runner who won the gold medal in the 5000 metres event at the 1960 Olympics. He also won gold medals in the 3 miles events at the 1958 and 1962 Commonwealth Games. He worked for the welfare of children with disabilities since he founded the Halberg Trust in 1963.

==Biography==
Born in Eketāhuna on 7 July 1933, Halberg later moved to Ōwairaka in Auckland, and attended Avondale College. He was a rugby player in his youth, but suffered a severe injury during a game, leaving his left arm withered. The next year, he took up running, seemingly being only more motivated by his disability. In 1951, he met Arthur Lydiard, who became his coach. Lydiard had been a famous long-distance runner, and had new ideas on the training of athletes. Three years later, Halberg broke through, winning his first national title on the senior level.

At the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games he placed fifth in the mile. At the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, he placed eleventh in the 1500 metres. Halberg won the gold medal in the three miles at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and later the same year became the first sub four-minute miler from New Zealand. He won the New Zealand Sportsman of the Year for 1958.

For the 1960 Rome Olympics, Halberg focused on the longer distances, entering in the 5000 and 10000 m. Halberg won the 5000 m gold, on the same day countryman Peter Snell was victorious in the 800 m. Halberg later placed fifth in the 10,000 m.

The following year, Halberg set four world records in events over imperial distances. After carrying the flag at the opening ceremonies, Halberg successfully defended his three-mile title at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. He closed out his running career at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, finishing seventh in the 10,000 m.

In the 1961 New Year Honours, Halberg was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to athletics. In the 1988 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for services to sport and crippled children. In the 2008 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Halberg was appointed to the Order of New Zealand. The following month he became only the fourth person to be awarded the Blake Medal, named after fellow countryman Sir Peter Blake, for his more than 50 years&#x27; service to athletics, and to children with disabilities. In 1963 he set up The Halberg Trust, which supports children with disabilities to be active in sport, creation and leisure. The organisation rebranded in 2012 to become the Halberg Disability Sport Foundation. For many years the organisation has managed the New Zealand Sportsman of the Year Award, which is now called the Halberg Awards.

Halberg House of Hutt International Boys&#x27; School is named after Sir Murray Halberg, and students in the house earn what are called &quot;meter points&quot; which relates to Sir Murray Halberg and his running career. Tauranga Boys&#x27; College also named a house after Sir Murray Halberg. Halberg Crescent, in the Hamilton suburb of Chartwell, is named in Halberg&#x27;s honour.

Halberg died in Auckland on 30 November 2022, at the age of 89.

<text>mLAN, short for Music Local Area Network, is a protocol for synchronized transmission and management of multi-channel digital audio, video, control signals and multi-port MIDI over a network. 

==Description==
The mLAN protocol was originally developed by Yamaha Corporation, and publicly introduced in January 2000. It was available under a royalty-free license to anyone interested in utilizing the technology.

mLAN uses several features of the IEEE 1394 (FireWire) standard such as isochronous transfer and intelligent connection management. There are two versions of the mLAN protocol. Version 1 requires S200 rate, while Version 2 requires S400 rate and supports synchronized streaming of digital audio at up to 24 bit word length and 192 kHz sample rate, MIDI and word clock at a bitrate up to 400 Megabits per second.

With the proper driver software, a computer-based digital audio workstation can interact with mLAN-compliant hardware via any OHCI-compliant FireWire port. mLAN consumes the entire bus bandwidth when operating and non-mLAN devices cannot share the same Firewire connection, so it is not possible to use hard drives, optical drives or other sound devices on the same Firewire bus when mLAN Manager software is running. 

The transport layers of mLAN have been standardized as IEC 61883.

==End of life==
By 2005, over 100 manufacturers were part of the mLAN Alliance however very few actual products had surfaced. 

As of early 2008, mLAN appeared to have reached the end of its product life. Third-party developers discontinued or retracted their mLAN products from the market, and Yamaha itself ceased any new releases of mLAN hardware or updates to the mLAN software and drivers. Even though more recent FireWire based products from Yamaha could interoperate with earlier mLAN devices using a computer, any mention of mLAN is notably absent from new product announcements and driver updates.

<text>Ahmad Jamal (born Frederick Russell Jones; July 2, 1930 – April 16, 2023) was an American jazz pianist, composer, bandleader, and educator. For six decades, he was one of the most successful small-group leaders in jazz. He was a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Jazz Master and won a Lifetime Achievement Grammy for his contributions to music history.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jamal was born Frederick Russell Jones in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 2, 1930. He began playing piano at the age of three, when his uncle Lawrence challenged him to duplicate what he was playing. Jamal began formal piano training at the age of seven with Mary Cardwell Dawson, who he said greatly influenced him. His Pittsburgh roots remained an important part of his identity (&quot;Pittsburgh meant everything to me and it still does,&quot; he said in 2001) and it was there that he was immersed in the influence of jazz artists such as Earl Hines, Billy Strayhorn, Mary Lou Williams, and Erroll Garner. Jamal studied with pianist James Miller and began playing piano professionally at the age of fourteen, at which point he was recognized as a &quot;coming great&quot; by the pianist Art Tatum. When asked about his practice habits by a critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jamal commented that, &quot;I used to practice and practice with the door open, hoping someone would come by and discover me. I was never the practitioner in the sense of twelve hours a day, but I always thought about music. I think about music all the time.&quot;

===Beginnings===

Jamal began touring with George Hudson&#x27;s Orchestra after graduating from George Westinghouse High School in 1948. He then joined touring group The Four Strings, that disbanded when violinist Joe Kennedy Jr. left. In 1950 he moved to Chicago, performing intermittently with local musicians Von Freeman and Claude McLin, and solo at the Palm Tavern, occasionally joined by drummer Ike Day.

Born to Baptist parents, Jamal became interested in Islam and Islamic culture in Detroit, where there was a sizeable Muslim community in the 1940s and 1950s. He converted to Islam and changed his name to Ahmad Jamal in 1950. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; a few years later, he said his decision to change his name stemmed from a desire to &quot;re-establish my original name.&quot; Shortly after his conversion to Islam, he explained to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he &quot;says Muslim prayers five times a day and arises in time to say his first prayers at 5 am. He says them in Arabic in keeping with the Muslim tradition.&quot;

Jamal made his first records in 1951 for the Okeh label with The Three Strings (which would later also be called the Ahmad Jamal Trio, although Jamal himself avoided using the term &quot;trio&quot;): the other members were guitarist Ray Crawford and a bassist, at different times Eddie Calhoun (1950–52), Richard Davis (1953–54), and Israel Crosby (from 1954). The Three Strings arranged an extended engagement at Chicago&#x27;s Blue Note, but leapt to fame after performing at the Embers in New York City where John Hammond saw the band play and signed them to Okeh Records. Hammond, a record producer who discovered the talents and enhanced the fame of musicians like Benny Goodman, Billie Holiday, and Count Basie, helped Jamal&#x27;s trio attract critical acclaim. Jamal subsequently recorded for Parrot (1953–55) and Epic (1955) using the piano-guitar-bass lineup.

===&quot;At the Pershing: But Not for Me&quot;===
The trio&#x27;s sound changed significantly when Crawford was replaced with drummer Vernel Fournier in 1957, and the group worked as the &quot;house trio&quot; at Chicago&#x27;s Pershing Hotel. The trio released the live album, &quot;At the Pershing: But Not for Me&quot;, which stayed on the Ten Best-selling charts for 108 weeks. Jamal&#x27;s recording of the piece &quot;Poinciana&quot; was first released on this album.

Perhaps Jamal&#x27;s most famous recording, &quot;At the Pershing: But Not for Me&quot;, was recorded at the Pershing Hotel in Chicago in 1958; it brought him popularity in the late 1950s and into the 1960s jazz age. Jamal played the set with bassist Israel Crosby and drummer Vernel Fournier. The set list expressed a diverse collection of tunes, including &quot;The Surrey with the Fringe on Top&quot; from the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and Jamal&#x27;s arrangement of the jazz standard &quot;Poinciana&quot;. Jazz musicians and listeners alike found inspiration in the &quot;At the Pershing&quot; recording, and Jamal&#x27;s trio was recognized as an integral new building block in the history of jazz. Evident were his unusually minimalist style and his extended vamps, according to reviewer John Morthland. &quot;The New York Times&quot; contributor Ben Ratliff said, in a review of the album: &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for an argument that pleasurable mainstream art can assume radical status at the same time, Jamal is your guide.&quot; After the recording of the best-selling album &quot;But Not For Me&quot;, Jamal&#x27;s music grew in popularity throughout the 1950s.

He attracted media coverage for his investment decisions pertaining to his &quot;rising fortune&quot;. In 1959, he took a tour of North Africa to explore investment options in Africa. Jamal, who was 29 at the time, said he had a curiosity about the homeland of his ancestors, highly influenced by his conversion to the Muslim faith. He also said his religion had brought him peace of mind about his race, which accounted for his &quot;growth in the field of music that has proved very lucrative for me.&quot; Upon his return to the U.S. after a tour of North Africa, the financial success of &quot;Live at the Pershing: But Not For Me&quot; allowed Jamal to open a restaurant and club called The Alhambra in Chicago, which lasted barely one year. In 1962, The Three Strings disbanded and Jamal recorded &quot;Macanudo&quot; with a full orchestra. He then took a brief hiatus from performing.

=== Return to music and &quot;The Awakening&quot; ===
In 1964, Jamal resumed performing after moving to New York, and started a residency at the Village Gate nightclub. He recorded a new album, &quot;Extensions&quot;, with bassist Jamil S. Nasser in 1965. Jamal and Nasser continued to play together from 1964 to 1972. He also joined forces with Fournier (again, 1965–1966) and drummer Frank Gant (1966–77), among others. Until 1970, he only played acoustic piano. The final album on which he played acoustic piano in the regular sequence was &quot;The Awakening&quot;. In the 1970s, he played electric piano as well, as on the instrumental recording of &quot;Suicide is Painless,&quot; theme song from the 1970 film &quot;MASH&quot;, which was released on a 1973 reissue of the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, replacing the original vocal version of the song by The Mash. Apparently, the Rhodes piano used was a gift from someone in Switzerland. He continued to play throughout the 1970s and 1980s, mostly in trios with piano, bass and drums, and occasionally expanded the group to include guitar. One of his most long-standing gigs was as the band for the New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations at Blues Alley in Washington, D.C., from 1979 through the 1990s.

=== Later career ===
In his 80s, Jamal continued to make numerous tours and recordings, including albums such as &quot;Saturday Morning&quot; (2013), the CD/DVD release &quot;Ahmad Jamal Featuring Yusef Lateef Live at L&#x27;Olympia&quot; (2014), &quot;Marseille&quot; (2017), and &quot;Ballades&quot; (2019), featuring mostly solo piano. Jamal was the main mentor of jazz piano virtuosos Hiromi Uehara, known as Hiromi, and Shahin Novrasli.

In 1986, Jamal sued critic Leonard Feather for using his former name in a publication.

=== Death ===
On April 16, 2023, Jamal died from complications of prostate cancer at home in Ashley Falls, Massachusetts. He was 92. His death was confirmed by his daughter, Sumayah Jamal.

==Style and influence==

Trained in both traditional jazz (&quot;American classical music&quot;, as he preferred to call it) and European classical style, Jamal was praised as one of the greatest jazz innovators over the course of his exceptionally long career. Following bebop greats like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, Jamal entered the world of jazz at a time when speed and virtuosic improvisation were central to the success of jazz musicians as artists. Jamal, however, took steps in the direction of a new movement, later coined &quot;cool jazz&quot; – an effort to move jazz in the direction of popular music. He emphasized space between notes in his musical compositions and interpretations instead of focusing on the fast-paced bebop style.

Because of this style, Jamal was &quot;often dismissed by jazz writers as no more than a cocktail pianist, a player so given to fluff that his work shouldn&#x27;t be considered seriously in any artistic sense&quot;. Stanley Crouch, author of &quot;Considering Genius&quot;, offered a very different reaction to Jamal&#x27;s music, claiming that, like the highly influential Thelonious Monk, Jamal was a true innovator of the jazz tradition and is second in importance in the development of jazz after 1945 only to Charlie Parker. His unique musical style stemmed from many individual characteristics, including his use of orchestral effects and his ability to control the beat of songs. These stylistic choices resulted in a unique and new sound for the piano trio: &quot;Through the use of space and changes of rhythm and tempo&quot;, wrote Crouch, &quot;Jamal invented a group sound that had all the surprise and dynamic variation of an imaginatively ordered big band.&quot; Jamal explored the texture of riffs, timbres, and phrases rather than the quantity or speed of notes in any given improvisation. Speaking about Jamal, A. B. Spellman of the National Endowment of the Arts said: &quot;Nobody except Thelonious Monk used space better, and nobody ever applied the artistic device of tension and release better.&quot; These (at the time) unconventional techniques that Jamal gleaned from both traditional classical and contemporary jazz musicians helped pave the way for later jazz greats like Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, McCoy Tyner, Cedar Walton, Ethan Iverson, and Bill Charlap.

Though Jamal is often overlooked by jazz critics and historians, he is frequently credited with having a great influence on Miles Davis. Davis is quoted as saying that he was impressed by Jamal&#x27;s rhythmic sense and his &quot;concept of space, his lightness of touch, his understatement&quot;. Miles used to send his crew to concerts of Jamal, so they could learn to play like Miles wanted it. Jamal&#x27;s contrasts (crafting melodies that included strong and mild tones, and fast and slow rhythms) were what impressed Miles. Jamal characterized what he thought Davis admired about his music as: &quot;my discipline as opposed to my space.&quot; Jamal and Davis became friends in the 1950s, and Davis continued to support Jamal as a fellow musician, often playing versions of Jamal&#x27;s own songs (&quot;Ahmad&#x27;s Blues&quot;, &quot;New Rhumba&quot;) until he died in 1991.

Jamal, speaking about his own work, said, &quot;I like doing ballads. They&#x27;re hard to play. It takes years of living, really, to read them properly.&quot; From an early age, Jamal developed an appreciation for the lyrics of the songs he learned: &quot;I once heard Ben Webster playing his heart out on a ballad. All of a sudden he stopped. I asked him, &#x27;Why did you stop, Ben?&#x27; He said, &#x27;I forgot the lyrics.&#x27;&quot; Jamal attributed the variety in his musical taste to the fact that he grew up in several eras: the big band era, the bebop years, and the electronic age. He said his style evolved from drawing on the techniques and music produced in these three eras. In 1985, Jamal agreed to do an interview and recording session with his fellow jazz pianist, Marian McPartland on her NPR show &quot;Piano Jazz&quot;. Jamal, who said he rarely would play &quot;But Not For Me&quot; due to its popularity after his 1958 recording, played an improvised version of the tune – though only after noting that he moved on to making ninety percent of his repertoire his own compositions. He said that when he grew in popularity from the &quot;Live at the Pershing&quot; album, he was severely criticized afterwards for not playing any of his own compositions.

In his later years, Jamal embraced the electronic influences affecting the genre of jazz. He also occasionally expanded his usual small ensemble of three to include a tenor saxophone (George Coleman) and a violin. A jazz fan interviewed by &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine about Jamal in 2010 described his development as &quot;more aggressive and improvisational these days. The word I used to use is avant garde; that might not be right. Whatever you call it, the way he plays is the essence of what jazz is.&quot;

Saxophonist Ted Nash described his experience with Jamal&#x27;s style in an interview with &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine: &quot;The way he comped wasn&#x27;t the generic way that lots of pianists play with chords in the middle of the keyboard, just filling things up. He gave lots of single line responses. He&#x27;d come back and throw things out at you, directly from what you played. It was really interesting because it made you stop, and allowed him to respond, and then you felt like playing something else – that&#x27;s something I don&#x27;t feel with a lot of piano players. It&#x27;s really quite engaging. I guess that&#x27;s another reason people focus in on him. He makes them hone in.&quot;

Jamal recorded with the voices of the Howard A. Roberts Chorale on &quot;The Bright, the Blue and the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Cry Young&quot;; with vibraphonist Gary Burton on &quot;In Concert&quot;; with brass, reeds, and strings celebrating his hometown of &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;; with &quot;The Assai Quartet&quot;; and with tenor saxophonist George Coleman on the album &quot;The Essence Part One&quot;.

<text>Shelf registration, shelf offering, or shelf prospectus is a type of public offering where certain issuers are allowed to offer and sell securities to the public without a separate prospectus for each act of offering and without the issue of further prospectus. Instead, there is a single prospectus for multiple, undefined future offerings. The prospectus (often as part of a registration statement) may be used to offer securities for up to several years after its publication.
A shelf registration statement is a filing with the SEC to register a public offering, usually where there is no present intention to immediately sell all the securities being registered. A shelf registration statement permits multiple offerings based on the same registration. Shelf registration is mostly used for sales of new securities by the issuer (primary offerings), although it might possibly be used for resales of outstanding securities (secondary offerings) or a combination of both.

For example, a company can file a shelf registration statement with a prospectus for 100,000,000 shares, $1,000,000,000 face value of bonds, $500,000,000 face value of convertible bonds, 50,000,000 Series A warrants, and 50,000,000 Series B warrants. These five different classes or series of securities are offered in a single document. The company may offer to sell all of them, none of them, or any part of some class. It can sell 30,000,000 shares at one time and another 50,000,000 a year later (it will then have 20,000,000 unissued shares covered by the shelf prospectus).

Before each offering and sale is actually made, the company must file a relatively short statement regarding material changes in its business and finances since the shelf prospectus was filed.

Shelf registration is usually available to companies deemed reliable by the securities regulation authority in the relevant country. Because of their purposefully time-constrained nature, shelf offerings are examined far less rigorously by those authorities than standard public offerings.

==United States==
Shelf registration is a process authorized by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under Rule 415 that allows a single registration document to be filed by a company that permits the issuance of multiple securities. Form S-3 issuers may use shelf registration to register securities that will be offered on an immediate, continuous or delayed basis.

In July 2005 the SEC put &quot;automatic registration&quot; shelf filings in place. This filing is a relaxed registration process that applies to well-known, seasoned issuers (WKSI, pronounced &quot;wiksy&quot;), and covers debt securities, common stock, preferred stock and warrants, among other various instruments. A WKSI is a company that has filed all annual, quarterly and current reports in a timely manner, and either has a greater than $700 million market capitalization or has issued $1 billion in registered debt offerings over the past three years.

Shelf registration is a registration of a new issue that can be prepared up to three years in advance, so that the issue can be offered quickly as soon as funds are needed or market conditions are favorable. For example, current market conditions in the housing market are not favorable for a specific firm to issue a public offering. In this case, it may not be a good time for a firm in the sector (e.g. a home builder) to come out with its second offering because many investors will be pessimistic about companies working in that sector. By using shelf registration, the firm can fulfill all registration-related procedures beforehand and go to market quickly when conditions become more favorable.

Finally, firms often use universal shelf filings and choose between debt and equity offerings based on the prevailing relative market conditions.

<doc id="582527" wikidata="Q13551889" url="?curid=582527" title="Host controller interface (USB, Firewire)">
<text>A USB and Firewire Host Controller Interface (UFHC) is a register-level interface that enables a host controller for USB or IEEE 1394 hardware to communicate with a host controller driver in software. The driver software is typically provided with an operating system of a personal computer, but may also be implemented by application-specific devices such as a microcontroller.

On the expansion card or motherboard controller, this involves much custom logic, with digital logic engines in the motherboard&#x27;s controller chip, plus analog circuitry managing the high-speed differential signals. On the software side, it requires a device driver (called a Host Controller Driver, or HCD).

==IEEE 1394==
===Open Host Controller Interface===
Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) is an open standard.

When applied to an IEEE 1394 (also known as FireWire; i.LINK or Lynx) card, OHCI means that the card supports a standard interface to the PC and can be used by the OHCI IEEE 1394 drivers that come with all modern operating systems. Because the card has a standard OHCI interface, the OS does not need to know in advance exactly who makes the card or how it works; it can safely assume that the card understands the set of well-defined commands that are defined in the standard protocol.

==USB==
===Open Host Controller Interface===
The OHCI standard for USB is similar to the OHCI standard for IEEE 1394, but supports USB 1.1 (full and low speeds) only; so as a result its register interface looks completely different. Compared with UHCI, it moves more intelligence into the controller, and thus is accordingly much more efficient; this was part of the motivation for defining it. If a computer provides non-x86 USB 1.1, or x86 USB 1.1 from a USB controller that is not made by Intel or VIA, it probably uses OHCI (e.g. OHCI is common on add-in PCI Cards based on an NEC chipset). It has many fewer intellectual property restrictions than UHCI. It only supports 32-bit memory addressing, so it requires an IOMMU or a computationally expensive bounce buffer to work with a 64-bit operating system. OHCI interfaces to the rest of the computer only with memory-mapped I/O.

===Universal Host Controller Interface===
Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI) is a proprietary interface created by Intel for USB 1.x (full and low speeds). It requires a license from Intel. A USB controller using UHCI does little in hardware and requires a software UHCI driver to do much of the work of managing the USB bus. It only supports 32-bit memory addressing, so it requires an IOMMU or a computationally expensive bounce buffer to work with a 64-bit operating system. UHCI is configured with port-mapped I/O and memory-mapped I/O, and also requires memory-mapped I/O for status updates and for data buffers needed to hold data that needs to be sent or data that was received.

===Enhanced Host Controller Interface===
The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is a high-speed controller standard applicable to USB 2.0. UHCI- and OHCI-based systems, as existed previously, entailed greater complexity and costs than necessary. Consequently, the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) insisted on a public specification for EHCI. Intel hosted EHCI conformance-testing and this helped to prevent the incursion of proprietary features.

Originally a PC providing high-speed ports had two controllers, one handling low- and full-speed devices and the second handling high-speed devices. Typically such a system had EHCI and either OHCI or UHCI drivers. The UHCI driver provides low- and full-speed interfaces for Intel or VIA chipsets&#x27; USB host controllers on the motherboard, or for any VIA discrete host controllers attached to the computer&#x27;s expansion bus. The OHCI driver provides low- and full-speed functions for USB ports of all other motherboard chipset vendors&#x27; integrated USB host controllers or discrete host controllers attached to the computer&#x27;s expansion bus. The EHCI driver provided high-speed functions for USB ports on the motherboard or on the discrete USB controller. More recent hardware routes all ports through an internal &quot;rate-matching&quot; hub (RMH) that converts all traffic involving any directly-connected ports working at full-speed and low-speed between the high-speed traffic presented to the EHCI controller and the full-speed or low-speed traffic that the ports operating at those speeds expect, allowing the EHCI controller to handle these devices.

The EHCI software interface specification defines both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of its data structures, so it does not need a bounce buffer or IOMMU to work with a 64-bit operating system if a rate-matching hub is implemented to provide full-speed and low-speed connectivity instead of companion controllers using either the UHCI specification or OHCI specification, both of which are 32-bit only specifications.

===Extensible Host Controller Interface===

Extensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) is the newest host controller standard that improves speed, power efficiency and virtualization over its predecessors. The goal was also to define a USB host controller to replace UHCI/OHCI/EHCI. It supports all USB device speeds (USB 3.1 SuperSpeed+, USB 3.0 SuperSpeed, USB 2.0 Low-, Full-, and High-speed, USB 1.1 Low- and Full-speed).

===Virtual Host Controller Interface===
Virtual Host Controller Interface (VHCI) refers to a virtual controller that may export virtual USB devices not backed by physical devices. For instance, on Linux, VHCI controllers are used to expose USB devices from other machines, attached using the USB/IP protocol.

===USB4 Host Interface===
The Host Interface defined in the USB4 Specification. It makes operating system to manage USB4 Host Route for USB, DisplayPort, PCI Express, Thunderbolt or Host-to-Host Communication.

<doc id="582530" wikidata="Q657469" url="?curid=582530" title="Lefschetz fixed-point theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem is a formula that counts the fixed points of a continuous mapping from a compact topological space formula_1 to itself by means of traces of the induced mappings on the homology groups of formula_1. It is named after Solomon Lefschetz, who first stated it in 1926.

The counting is subject to an imputed multiplicity at a fixed point called the fixed-point index. A weak version of the theorem is enough to show that a mapping without &quot;any&quot; fixed point must have rather special topological properties (like a rotation of a circle).

==Formal statement==
For a formal statement of the theorem, let

:formula_3

be a continuous map from a compact triangulable space formula_1 to itself. Define the Lefschetz number formula_5 of formula_6 by

:formula_7

the alternating (finite) sum of the matrix traces of the linear maps induced by formula_6 on formula_9, the singular homology groups of formula_1 with rational coefficients.

A simple version of the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem states: if

:formula_11

then formula_6 has at least one fixed point, i.e., there exists at least one formula_13 in formula_1 such that formula_15. In fact, since the Lefschetz number has been defined at the homology level, the conclusion can be extended to say that any map homotopic to formula_6 has a fixed point as well.

Note however that the converse is not true in general: formula_5 may be zero even if formula_6 has fixed points, as is the case for the identity map on odd-dimensional spheres.

==Sketch of a proof==
First, by applying the simplicial approximation theorem, one shows that if formula_6 has no fixed points, then (possibly after subdividing formula_1) formula_6 is homotopic to a fixed-point-free simplicial map (i.e., it sends each simplex to a different simplex). This means that the diagonal values of the matrices of the linear maps induced on the simplicial chain complex of formula_1 must be all be zero. Then one notes that, in general, the Lefschetz number can also be computed using the alternating sum of the matrix traces of the aforementioned linear maps (this is true for almost exactly the same reason that the Euler characteristic has a definition in terms of homology groups; see below for the relation to the Euler characteristic). In the particular case of a fixed-point-free simplicial map, all of the diagonal values are zero, and thus the traces are all zero.

==Lefschetz–Hopf theorem==
A stronger form of the theorem, also known as the Lefschetz–Hopf theorem, states that, if formula_6 has only finitely many fixed points, then

:formula_24

where formula_25 is the set of fixed points of formula_6, and formula_27 denotes the index of the fixed point formula_13. From this theorem one deduces the Poincaré–Hopf theorem for vector fields, since every vector field on compact differential manifold induce flow formula_29 in a natural way. For every formula_30 formula_31 is continuous mapping homotopic to identity (thus have same Lefschetz number) and for small formula_30 indices of fixed points equals to indices of zeroes of vector field.

==Relation to the Euler characteristic==
The Lefschetz number of the identity map on a finite CW complex can be easily computed by realizing that each formula_33 can be thought of as an identity matrix, and so each trace term is simply the dimension of the appropriate homology group. Thus the Lefschetz number of the identity map is equal to the alternating sum of the Betti numbers of the space, which in turn is equal to the Euler characteristic formula_34. Thus we have
:formula_35

==Relation to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem==
The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem generalizes the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, which states that every continuous map from the formula_36-dimensional closed unit disk formula_37 to formula_37 must have at least one fixed point.

This can be seen as follows: formula_37 is compact and triangulable, all its homology groups except formula_40 are zero, and every continuous map formula_41 induces the identity map formula_42, whose trace is one; all this together implies that formula_5 is non-zero for any continuous map formula_41.

==Historical context==
Lefschetz presented his fixed-point theorem in . Lefschetz&#x27;s focus was not on fixed points of maps, but rather on what are now called coincidence points of maps.

Given two maps formula_6 and formula_46 from an orientable manifold formula_1 to an orientable manifold formula_48 of the same dimension, the &quot;Lefschetz coincidence number&quot; of formula_6 and formula_46 is defined as

:formula_51

where formula_52 is as above, formula_53 is the homomorphism induced by formula_46 on the cohomology groups with rational coefficients, and formula_55 and formula_56 are the Poincaré duality isomorphisms for formula_1 and formula_48, respectively.

Lefschetz proved that if the coincidence number is nonzero, then formula_6 and formula_46 have a coincidence point. He noted in his paper that letting formula_61 and letting formula_46 be the identity map gives a simpler result, which is now known as the fixed-point theorem.

==Frobenius==
Let formula_1 be a variety defined over the finite field formula_64 with formula_65 elements and let formula_66 be the base change of formula_1 to the algebraic closure of formula_64. The Frobenius endomorphism of formula_66 (often the &quot;geometric Frobenius&quot;, or just &quot;the Frobenius&quot;), denoted by formula_70, maps a point with coordinates formula_71 to the point with coordinates formula_72. Thus the fixed points of formula_70 are exactly the points of formula_1 with coordinates in formula_64; the set of such points is denoted by formula_76. The Lefschetz trace formula holds in this context, and reads:

:formula_77

This formula involves the trace of the Frobenius on the étale cohomology, with compact supports, of formula_66 with values in the field of formula_79-adic numbers, where formula_79 is a prime coprime to formula_65.

If formula_1 is smooth and equidimensional, this formula can be rewritten in terms of the &quot;arithmetic Frobenius&quot; formula_83, which acts as the inverse of formula_70 on cohomology:

:formula_85

This formula involves usual cohomology, rather than cohomology with compact supports.

The Lefschetz trace formula can also be generalized to algebraic stacks over finite fields.

<doc id="582541" wikidata="Q4938349" url="?curid=582541" title="Boilermaker Road Race">
<text>The Boilermaker Road Race is a USATF-certified foot race and wheelchair race held annually in Utica, New York, United States. 
Although local recreational runners are the majority of entrants, the race is highly competitive, with international professional runners filling the top ranks. With the exception of 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Boilermaker has been held every year since 1978. Traditionally, the Boilermaker is held on the second Sunday in July, although the 2021 Boilermaker was held on October 10 due to COVID-related concerns. Although 15Ks are uncommon compared to other road races, the Boilermaker has been rated highly by running publications. 

The race course is primarily in the city of Utica, with the earlier portion largely within the Utica Parks and Parkway Historic District. The course passes through the suburbs New Hartford and Yorkville near Utica University. The course is hilly, changing 300 feet in elevation over its length: combined with the mid-summer heat, winning race times are generally longer than for other 15K races. The finish line lies outside the F.X. Matt Brewery, where post-race festivities are held.

Like many urban races in the United States, the Boilermaker was created during the 1970s running boom. The first Boilermaker was held on July 16, 1978, with a budget of $750 and 800 local runners participating. The name alludes to a primary underwriter of the race, the Utica Radiator Corporation (now Utica Boilers, part of ECR International), whose main offices are near the race starting line. The wheelchair section was added in 1980. The race gained prominence in 1983 when American distance runner Bill Rodgers won with a time of 44:38. From 1997 to 2006, the Boilermaker was known as the largest 15K race in the United States, but was overtaken by the Gate River Run in Jacksonville, Florida, in later years. 

The Boilermaker has been described as an essential part of the identity of its host city, Utica, like the Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta, Georgia. Semi-unofficial performances and parties fill the sidewalk along much of the race course: Runners World magazine described the Boilermaker as &quot;part road race, part festival.&quot;

==Past winners==


Key:

Due to COVID-19 concerns, international professional runners were not invited to the 2021 race. Thus, the winning times in that year&#x27;s race are longer than in prior years, with Americans taking first place in both divisions for the first time since 1991. The field in the wheelchair race was also much smaller that year, consisting of only four competitors, all from New York State.

The John Korir who won the 2024 race is not the same as John Korir Kipsang, who won the 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 races.

<doc id="582544" wikidata="Q1380135" url="?curid=582544" title="Levellers (band)">
<text>Levellers are an English folk rock and anarcho-punk band formed in Brighton, East Sussex, in 1988, consisting of Mark Chadwick (guitar and vocals), Jeremy Cunningham (bass guitar), Charlie Heather (drums), Jon Sevink (violin), Simon Friend (guitar and vocals), Matt Savage (keyboards) and Dan Donnelly (guitar and vocals). Taking their name from the Levellers political movement, the band released their first EP in 1989 and LP in 1990, with international success following upon signing to China Records and the release of their second album &quot;Levelling the Land&quot;. The band were among the most popular indie bands in Britain in the early 1990s, and performed at the Glastonbury Festival, first in 1992, then in 1994, where they performed as the headline act on The Pyramid Stage to a record crowd of 300,000 people. They continue to record and tour.

==History==

===1988–1990===
The band was formed with Mark Chadwick on guitar and lead vocals, Jeremy Cunningham on bass guitar, and Charlie Heather on drums. Jon Sevink, the brother of Chadwick&#x27;s girlfriend, was brought in to play the fiddle. Chadwick&#x27;s flatmate &quot;Bucky&quot; was brought in to play the guitar, but lost interest after a few months.

Chadwick and Cunningham composed their first recordings for the compact cassettes &quot;An Agreement of the People&quot; and &quot;All the Free Commons of England&quot;. A group of fans known as the &quot;happy hitchers&quot; would hitch-hike around the country, following the band while they were on tour.

Their first EP, &quot;Carry Me&quot;, was released in 1989 and contained the songs &quot;Carry Me&quot; and &quot;England My Home&quot;, which received Radio 2 airplay. At that time the band recruited Alan Miles to play harmonica, guitar, and mandolin and to perform backing vocals. This lineup produced the EP &quot;Outside/Inside&quot; and toured throughout 1989 and most of 1990.

After re-releasing two EPs on their own Hag label, in 1989, the Levellers signed a contract with French record label Musidisc. Their first album &quot;A Weapon Called the Word&quot; was released in 1990 and went platinum. The first single from the album was &quot;World Freak Show&quot;.

===1990–1994===
After an acrimonious split with Musidisc, the Levellers were discovered by Derek Green and signed to China Records.

At this point Miles became disenchanted with touring and left the band. The Levellers recruited Simon Friend who had played some acoustic support slots for the band in the past. Around this time Friend and Chadwick played a number of low-key shows as &quot;The Levellers 2&quot;, mostly performing songs that had been in Friend&#x27;s repertoire as a solo singer-songwriter.

1991 saw the release of the Levellers&#x27; second album, &quot;Levelling the Land&quot;, which entered the charts at number 14. The anthemic single &quot;One Way&quot;, despite not reaching the Top 40, became a popular song and live favourite for years to come among the travelling and indie music community, as well as &quot;The Boatman&quot; and the telling of the story of &quot;Battle of the Beanfield&quot;.

Throughout 1992 the band enjoyed a series of successful tours, particularly their debut on one of the main stages of the Glastonbury Festival. Mixing tracks from their first two LPs with a couple of more obscure songs and a cover of Charlie Daniels&#x27; &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;, the Levellers&#x27; performance secured their place on the large Pyramid Stage for the following year. The band also scored a chart hit with the &quot;15 Years EP&quot;.

The generally gloomy atmosphere that surrounded the band is reflected in the darker tone of the resulting &quot;Levellers&quot; album. Despite the band&#x27;s dislike of the album, it reached No. 2 in the album charts. It included &quot;This Garden&quot;, which reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart. In June 1993 they released the &quot;Belaruse EP&quot; which included a live cover of &quot;Subvert&quot;, the first single from the anarchist punk band Zounds.

===1994–1998===
1994 saw the Levellers reach the peak of their popularity with a headlining appearance at Glastonbury Festival and a record breaking set on the main stage when they performed to around 300,000 people, speculated to be the largest ever at the festival. They also became involved in the campaign against the Criminal Justice Act.

In 1994 the band purchased a derelict factory in Brighton, named the &quot;Metway&quot; after the factory&#x27;s original owners, and created a self-contained headquarters. The buildings housed their offices, fan club, rehearsal area, a bar and a recording studio that was initially equipped with gear bought from Tom Robinson. The move enabled the band to operate on their own terms as far as possible. The spare space that remained was given over to other Brighton musicians and small craft businesses. Weekly anarchist newspaper SchNEWS also set up their office in the building.

&quot;Hope Street&quot;, the lead single from the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; album, was the first recording to come out of Metway. The album was released in September 1995 and charted at No. 2 in the week of its release. Buoyed by the initial success, manager Phil Nelson persuaded China Records to advertise the album on television and, unusually, the album reached No. 1 in its second week on the chart. The third single released from this album took the Levellers to their first Top of the Pops appearance, playing the tongue-in-cheek drinking anthem &quot;Just the One&quot; whilst dressed in tuxedos. &quot;Just the One&quot; was specially re-recorded for the single release, with The Clash&#x27;s frontman and long-time Levellers hero Joe Strummer guesting on honky tonk piano. It reached No. 12 in the UK.

The Levellers embarked on another tour of Europe and the UK towards the end of 1995, culminating in a one-off &quot;Christmas Freakshow&quot; at Sheffield Arena on 18 December. This was recorded by the BBC with eight songs being broadcast at a later date on Radio 1. The 1995 &quot;Total Chaos&quot; tour came to an end on 7 February 1996 at Blackpool&#x27;s Empress Ballroom with a show that was filmed for the video and live album release, &quot;Headlights, White Lines, Black Tar Rivers (Best Live)&quot;. The album reached No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart and a less extensive UK tour was undertaken in September/October to support the record&#x27;s release. An EP &quot;Exodus EP&quot; was lifted from the live album.

The band returned to the studio through late 1996 and early 1997 when the album &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot; was recorded. Their first gigs in several months coincided with the Labour Party&#x27;s landslide general election victory on 1 May 1997, one being held at Manchester Academy and a second at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy the following night. These gigs previewed several new songs including &quot;What a Beautiful Day&quot;, which became the first single release from &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot; and reached No. 13 on the UK chart.

Summer 1997 saw the band play at various festivals in the UK and Europe including a return to Glastonbury Festival, playing an afternoon slot on the Pyramid Stage. The album was finally released in August 1997 and entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 5. The album spawned several more singles, &quot;Celebrate&quot;, &quot;Dog Train&quot; and &quot;Too Real&quot;, the last of which had an accompanying video directed by cult film director Alex Cox.

&quot;One Way of Life: The Very Best of The Levellers&quot; was released in September 1998. The album was a traditional &quot;greatest hits&quot; package of the hit singles, with two new songs, &quot;Shadow on the Sun&quot; and &quot;Bozos&quot;. Additionally, &quot;One Way&quot; and &quot;Carry Me&quot; were re-recorded, and a re-mix of &quot;Too Real&quot; was included. A limited edition digipak format was released with an extra five-track CD of &quot;acoustic&quot; versions. A long and successful tour across the UK followed in November and December. However, the last two dates at Brixton Academy and the planned homecoming at Brighton Centre had to be postponed when Jon Sevink fell ill. These dates were rescheduled for February 1999. The release of the greatest hits album was accompanied by a video collection of promos, also called &quot;One Way of Life: The Very Best of The Levellers&quot;, and the band&#x27;s official biography written by George Berger entitled &quot;Dance Before the Storm&quot;.

===1999–2008===

The Levellers played only a handful of live dates in 1999. During this time out of the limelight there was a significant change at their record company as China Records was bought by major label Warner Brothers.

Work eventually began on a new studio album, &quot;Hello Pig&quot;. The band drafted in Mark Wallis, who had worked with Oasis amongst others, to produce the record. This was an obvious change in direction, and the resulting complex production coloured the album. &quot;Happy Birthday Revolution&quot; was released as a single, reaching No. 57 in the charts. Just before the album&#x27;s release the band promoted their own &quot;OTF Weekender&quot;. This was held on the Isle of Wight with two big shows at the Ryde Ice Arena and a &quot;secret&quot; acoustic show held at a much smaller venue.

&quot;Hello Pig&quot; was released on Monday 4 September 2000, and went to No. 28. It received possibly the best critical acclaim the band had yet received, but was less popular with existing fans. With the relative commercial failure of the album, the band and the record company severed their relationship by mutual agreement.

Despite the downturn in record sales, the Levellers performed a heavy gig schedule through late 2000 and 2001. This included a return to the United States as a stripped down version featuring only Chadwick, Friend and Sevink playing acoustic shows in February 2001, with the same trio returning to play a lengthier tour in June the same year.

In early 2002, their focus returned to making new music with Al Scott returning as producer. After the recording was completed, the band played a short UK tour of smaller venues to preview the new songs, and they were well received by the fans and heralded as a &quot;return to form&quot;. Meanwhile, after contemplating releasing the new material on their own Hag label, the band eventually signed a new deal with Eagle Records. The &quot;Come On&quot; single preceded the album and failed to make the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Green Blade Rising&quot; (originally a title of one of the Levellers&#x27; earliest songs) was released in September 2002 and also failed to reach the Top 40 of the UK Albums Chart.

Meanwhile, the band were growing weary of the existing UK festival scene and decided to put on a festival of their own. This would be a return - as far as UK legislation would allow - to the earlier festivals that the young Levellers had enjoyed, such as Elephant Fayre. &quot;Green Blade Fayre&quot; was the title of the first attempt, and was to be held at Bicton Park, East Devon, England in August 2002. Despite the backing of the necessary authorities, an organised local population managed to persuade the East Devon council to reject the licence application.

Nonetheless, in 2003 the Levellers founded their own festival - Beautiful Days. The festival is now an annual event, taking place each August at Escot Park, near Fairmile in Devon, England. In February 2004, the Levellers played a special acoustic gig at the Buxton Opera House. Although they had played a couple of shows in a similar format, this particular show saw the full band being joined onstage for collaborations with Maddy Prior, Nick Harper, Nick Burbridge, and Rev Hammer. The show set the tone for the rest of the year, with the band appearing at many festivals through the summer in the acoustic guise, including the Beverley Folk Festival in June. These festival dates included their first visit to Glastonbury since 1997, where they captured another audience record on the Avalon Stage. The year was rounded off with an acoustic tour of UK theatres.

In May 2005 the Levellers&#x27; seventh studio album &quot;Truth and Lies&quot; was released. Mark Wallis returned as producer, with Dave Ruffy - drummer with UK punk band The Ruts - also producing. The album, released on Eagle Records, was generally upbeat - typified by the track &quot;Make You Happy&quot; - and a second single, &quot;Last Man Alive&quot;, was also released. Following the previous year&#x27;s acoustic live work, 2005 saw the band tour the UK and Europe as a full electric band once again, and this continued into 2006.

Disillusioned with Eagle Records&#x27; attempt to market their music, the Levellers decided to set up their own record label - On the Fiddle Recordings. The label&#x27;s first release was a live DVD, &quot;Chaos Theory&quot;, in October 2006 and includes a live show from Reading Hexagon and the 1993 tour diary/concert &quot;Part Time Punks&quot;.

In early 2007, the band went on an electric tour, visiting Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Ireland. The intensive touring schedule continued with the band playing a number of festivals throughout the summer, including Wychwood, Rhythm, Bestival, Fflam, Solfest and Le Mans 24 Hours. During this time their Warner albums were remixed and re-issued on the Rhino label in 2007.

The winter touring schedule was comparatively light, with an eleven-show electric tour of Europe in November and a short acoustic tour of the UK in December. Sessions for a new album were also underway around this time, with Sean Lakeman (brother of Seth) as producer. February 2008 saw Chadwick, Friend, and Sevink participate in the &quot;Freeborn John&quot; tour, while in March the band played four 20th anniversary gigs in a short tour termed &quot;Beautiful Nights&quot;. This trio of gigs began at Wolverhampton Civic Hall on 6 March, continued with a gig at Manchester Apollo on 7 March, and concluded with a show at London Brixton Academy on 8 March.

Appearing once again at a host of festivals throughout the summer of 2008, the Levellers showcased tracks from their upcoming album. Released in August 2008, coinciding with the Beautiful Days Festival, &quot;Letters from the Underground&quot;, was their eighth studio album and charted at No. 24, the band&#x27;s first Top 30 album in a decade.

===2009–present=== 
In 2009, On the Fiddle released a recording of their 2008 appearance at the Royal Albert Hall - &quot;Live At The Royal Albert Hall&quot; via iTunes. At the start of 2010, the band toured the UK, visiting Crewe, Holmfirth, Brecon and Tunbridge Wells. The band performed at the Glastonbury music festival in the summer and then continued on the &#x27;grass roots&#x27; path with a tour in November to promote the re-release of their debut album, &quot;A Weapon Called The Word&quot; on their own On the Fiddle label. The band received the Roots Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2011.

Their first new album in four years, &quot;Static on the Airwaves&quot; was released in June 2012, via On the Fiddle. The first single from the album, &quot;Truth Is&quot;, was released for Record Store Day on limited edition red vinyl. The band released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in September 2014, featuring four new collaborations with Imelda May, Frank Turner, Bellowhead and Billy Bragg. A film &quot;A Curious Life: The Story of the Levellers&quot; (by Dunstan Bruce, formerly of Chumbawamba), was released in June 2015.

In 2016 they embarked on a UK tour of the &quot;Levelling The Land&quot; album to mark its 25th anniversary, reissuing the album themselves in a special box set along with a live recording of the album. In 2017, they began working with producer John Leckie at Abbey Road&#x27;s Studio 2. In 2018, the Levellers released &quot;We the Collective&quot; in which they reworked several of their songs with a string and percussion section composed of members of folk-rock band Moulettes. Hannah Moulette also sings on some tracks. The collective recorded two entirely new tracks &quot;The Shame&quot; and &quot;Drug Bust McGee&quot; to create a 10 track album. The album reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart.

On 7 February 2020, the band announced via their Twitter account that their new album &quot;Peace&quot; would be released on 14 August 2020, with the advance release of first single &#x27;Food Roof Family&#x27;. It is the band&#x27;s first studio album of new material in eight years.

In 2022, the band announced that Dan Donnelly had joined as a full time member, while clarifying that Simon Friend remained a member and was expected to rejoin the band on the road in future.

=== Timeline ===
== Band name origin ==
Self-described as having &quot;a left-wing view of politics&quot;, the band took their name after the 17th-century Levellers political movement. This was speculated for many years, but confirmed in October 2014 by band member Cunningham.

== Levellers logo (&quot;Rolling anarchy&quot;) ==
The &quot;Rolling anarchy&quot; logo, designed by Jeremy Cunningham, is often used by the band. It is composed of three sickles placed so as to form the letter A, recognizable however the logo is rotated.

The symbol is often featured on Levellers merchandise and at concerts. It is usually surrounded with the text &quot;Whoever puts their hand upon me to govern me is a usurper, a tyrant, and I declare them my enemy.&quot; These words, originally by the French anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, had previously been used by the band Zounds who originally released their single &quot;Can&#x27;t Cheat Karma&quot; featuring this quote on the Crass records label.

<text>The Abdul-Aziz al-Samarrai Mosque is an Islamic mosque located in Fallujah, Iraq.

The mosque came to worldwide attention when Sunni militants inside the mosque directed small-arms and rocket fire at US Marines. US forces returned fire, when a Cobra helicopter fired a Hellfire missile at the base of the mosque&#x27;s minaret and an F-16 intentionally dropped a bomb on the mosque. A US Marines brigadier general said the mosque would ordinarily have protection under the Geneva Convention, but added that the attacks from inside the building caused it to lose its status. It was initially claimed that forty rebels had been killed in the strike, but it was later stated that no bodies were actually found at the scene. Other sources claim as many as 50 were killed in the attack.

<text>Bærums Verk is a village in Bærum in Akershus, Norway, with a population of about 8000. It is located on both sides of the river Lomma.

==History==

Iron ore was found in the areas now known as Kirkerud and Eineåsen in Bærum in 1603 and 1604, and in 1610 Christian IV granted Paul Smelter the right to build, at his own expense, a foundry in the area. The first foundry was built near the farm of Wøyen, further downriver from today&#x27;s Bærums Verk, and then another one at Gommerud, closer. In 1615 Smelter bought several farms at the present site and consolidated the foundry in one center. This was unusual practice at the time, but turned out to be successful. All other foundries in Oslo, Aker, and Bærum were shut down as a consequence, and Smelter achieved a virtual monopoly in the Oslo area.

The crown ran the works until 1624 when Det Norske Jernkompani took over and mismanaged to the point that the foundry was shut down in 1641, after a flood had damaged much of the plant in 1638. Gabriel Marcelis (the elder), a Dutch merchant with close ties to the Danish crown, took over operations in 1641 and invested in a double blast furnace that produced nails, iron parts, bullets, and cannonballs.

The Krefting family took over the works in 1664 and built on Marcelis&#x27;s investments to expand the capacity at Bærums Verk. Especially under the administration of Anna Krefting (née Vogt) from 1712 to 1766, the works grew to become the largest of its kind in Norway. Even after a devastating fire in 1762, Anna rebuilt the entire plant in two years. After Anna Krefting&#x27;s death in 1766, her family sold the works to an investment company.

In 1773, Conrad Clausen, then only 18, took over the works and continued Krefting&#x27;s efforts to expand its activities. He rebuilt the blast furnace so it could run also when there was low water flow in Lomma, built a school on the site, and included also the works at Fossum at Lysakerelven in the operations. Clausen died in 1785, only 31 years old. His widow ran the works for a few years but sold it to Peder Anker, the owner of Bogstad.

Peder Anker connected Bærums Verk to his growing commercial network, among other things by building Ankerveien, connecting Bærums Verk with Fossum (and thereby Bogstad), Sognsvann, Maridalen and ultimately Hakadalen via Greveveien.

After Peder Anker died in 1824, Herman Wedel Jarlsberg took over the works, passing it on to his son Harald Wedel Jarlsberg in 1840. The Wedel Jarlsberg family were among the last nobility in Norway and were active both in national and local politics. On May 22, 1874, the blast furnace was shut down and replaced by a regular cast iron works and workshop.

In 1889, the works went into the Løvenskiold family through inheritance, where it remains to this day. Production was diversified to include a large variety of cast iron products. The works were closed down in 1964, and in the 1980s large surrounding tracts were developed for residential purposes. In 1997, the old factory site was redeveloped as a retail commercial center. Several of the buildings are protected, including Norway&#x27;s oldest tavern.

==Current use==

The center now known as Bærums Verk is situated on the site of the old foundry, nestled in a narrow valley along the river Lomma. The buildings straddle the river, with several pedestrian bridges connecting them. The center includes several restaurants, two supermarkets, and several specialty retail stores.

The foundry itself has been converted into a shopping centre. The shopping centre is owned by the Løvenskiold family, who also owns the Maxbo hardware store chain. A museum, featuring ovens produced in the foundry from the 18th century up to 1964, and shops with products handcrafted on site are situated in the old buildings.

<doc id="582552" wikidata="Q1692857" url="?curid=582552" title="Battle of Losecoat Field">
<text>The Battle of Losecoat Field (also known as the Battle of Empingham) was fought on 12 March 1470, during the Wars of the Roses. Spellings of &quot;Losecoat&quot; vary, with &quot;Losecote&quot; and &quot;Loose-coat&quot; also seen.

The battle secured the defeat of the poorly organised Welles Uprising against King Edward IV, but ultimately led to the defection of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick and the king&#x27;s brother George, Duke of Clarence to the Lancastrian cause after they were forced to flee the country having been implicated in the rebellion.

==Background==
Almost a year earlier, in July 1469, an army loyal to the Yorkist king, King Edward IV was defeated at the Battle of Edgcote by Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, his disaffected former supporter; Edward himself was subsequently captured in Olney, Buckinghamshire. However, with the help and support of his brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, he had by now regained power. Despite the nominal reconciliation of Warwick and the king, by March 1470 Warwick found himself in a similar position to that which he had been in before the battle of Edgcote. He was unable to exercise any control over, or influence, Edward&#x27;s policies. Warwick wanted to place another of the king&#x27;s brothers, George, Duke of Clarence, on the throne so that he could regain his influence. To do so, he called on former supporters of the defeated House of Lancaster.

The rebellion was initiated in 1470 by Sir Robert Welles, son of Richard Welles, 7th Baron Welles, a former Lancastrian, when his family fell foul of Edward. Sir Robert turned to Warwick for help. Warwick judged the time was ripe for another coup d&#x27;état, to kill Edward or remove him from the throne.

Welles started gathering troops at his base in Lincolnshire, ready for a show of arms against the king. The unrest in Lincolnshire prompted the king to act, and he started gathering men for his army on 4 March. The news of the king&#x27;s intention to march to Lincolnshire quickly spread panic among people there. Due to Welles&#x27; deliberate misinterpretation, rumours were quickly spread that the king was coming to try the previously pardoned rebels from Edgcote, and that he would &quot;hang and draw a great number&quot; of them.

With the encouragement of Warwick and Clarence, Welles set himself up as a &quot;great captain&quot; of the people of Lincolnshire. On 4 March summons were sent to all the surrounding estates requesting every able man to join him in resisting the king. On the 7th the king heard that the rebels were marching towards Stamford with an army of 100,000 men, having recruited many men from nearby counties, especially from Yorkshire.

The king later received letters from Clarence and Warwick stating they were marching North with all their men to support the king. The king then unsuspectingly issued commissions of array which included Warwick&#x27;s name, authorising him to raise his own army of professional soldiers. Edward then received news that the rebels had changed course for Leicester, as had Warwick and Clarence, which revealed their intentions. 

Welles received a letter from the King telling him to disband his rebel army, or his father Lord Welles (previously taken prisoner by Edward) would be executed. Welles quickly turned back with his army to Stamford. Edward&#x27;s confidence grew when Welles failed to rendezvous with Warwick and his experienced forces.

==Battle==
Edward&#x27;s scouts informed him that the rebel army was some from Stamford, arrayed for battle beside the Great North Road to the north of Tickencote Warren near Empingham in Rutland.

Edward positioned his men in a battle line to the north of Welles&#x27; army, and then, in the space separating the two forces, had Lord Welles executed in sight of both armies.

This action set the rebels advancing with cries of &quot;á Warwick&quot; and &quot;á Clarence&quot;. A single barrage of cannonballs was fired and then Edward had his men charge towards the enemy. Before the leaders of this attack could even come to blows with the rebel front line the battle was over. The rebels broke and fled rather than face the king&#x27;s highly trained men.

Both captains, Sir Robert Welles and his commander of foot Richard Warren were captured during the rout and were executed a week later on 19 March. Welles confessed his treason, and named Warwick and Clarence as the &quot;partners and chief provokers&quot; of the rebellion. Documents were also found proving the complicity of Warwick and Clarence, who were forced to flee the country.

==Name==
According to popular etymology, the name of the battle is explained in this way; many of Welles&#x27; men were wearing jackets displaying Warwick&#x27;s and Clarence&#x27;s livery, and when the rout began, not wanting to be caught wearing such identification, many discarded their garments. The battle was thus called &quot;Lose-coat&quot;. This story does not appear to have any historical basis, being first recorded in the 19th century. Contemporary accounts refer to the battle site as &quot;Hornfield&quot; (Horn was an adjacent parish), and do not use the name Losecoat or anything comparable.

The name is probably derived from an Old English phrase &quot;hlose-cot&quot; meaning &quot;pigsty cottage&quot;. Forms of Losecote also appear as field names in other parishes in Rutland. A field at the site of the battle seems to have acquired that name, which later generated the imaginary &quot;lose coat&quot; etymology which was linked to the battle. An adjacent woodland is now called Bloody Oaks and Bloody Oaks Quarry is a 1.3-hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, owned and managed by the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust.

<doc id="582555" wikidata="Q11303899" url="?curid=582555" title="Golden Miller">
<text>Golden Miller (1927–1957) was a Thoroughbred racehorse who is the most successful Cheltenham Gold Cup horse ever, winning the race in five consecutive years between 1932 and 1936. He also is the only horse to win both of the United Kingdom&#x27;s premier steeplechase races - the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Grand National - in the same year (1934).

==Breeding== 
Golden Miller was bred at the yard of Laurence Geraghty, grandfather of jockey Barry Geraghty, in Pelletstown, Co. Meath, Ireland in 1927. He was sired by the unraced Goldcourt, who stood at a stud fee of five guineas and sired two Irish Grand National winners. His dam, Miller&#x27;s Pride, was an ex-hunter who was placed and the dam of the good steeplechaser May Crescent. Her sire, Wavelet&#x27;s Pride, won the Great Metropolitan Stakes, a hurdle race, and other races before he became a top jumper sire.

Golden Miller had already changed hands a couple of times when a young trainer from Longstowe, Cambridgeshire, Basil Briscoe, bought him for 500 guineas.

==Racing record==
As a three year old Golden Miller ran in a hurdle race at Southwell. Briscoe then took him hunting but this did not appeal to Golden Miller. He began to improve, though, and after a narrow defeat in a steeplechase at Newbury, he was bought by Mr Philip Carr, father of a Nottinghamshire cricketer, Arthur Carr, for £1,000. The new owner died soon afterwards and Golden Miller was sold for £6,000 to Miss Dorothy Paget, who had just engaged Basil Briscoe as her private trainer. 

Golden Miller therefore returned to Basil Briscoe. Dorothy Paget was the British flat racing Champion Owner in 1943, and the leading National Hunt owner in 1933-34, 1940–41 and 1951-52.

In 1931, Golden Miller made his steeplechasing debut at Newbury where he finished first, only to be disqualified for carrying incorrect weight. On 30 December, he won the Reading Chase before winning the Sefton Steeplechase on 20 January 1932.

=== Golden Miller&#x27;s five victories in the Cheltenham Gold Cup - 1932 to 1936 ===
1932

Golden Miller was five years old and trained by Basil Briscoe when he ran in the Gold Cup in 1932. He had run in only four steeplechases, winning three (though disqualified in one on technical grounds) and finishing a close second in the other. It was a good record but it was felt he was rather young to compete against seasoned chasers in the Gold Cup, so his starting price was 13/2. Grakle was favourite at 10/11.

In 1932 the Cheltenham fences were much stiffer than usual, because the Inspector of Courses had ordered six inches to be taken off each fence before the first day of the meeting. Fifty-six horses fell during the three days, and an amateur rider, Count Louis Bernheim, was killed when Summer Song came down.

In the Gold Cup, Aruntius made a bad mistake at the fence after the water jump. Kingsford, just behind, was unsighted and had a fatal fall. Grakle, the favourite, ridden by Mr Jack Fawcus, cleared the fence but swerved to avoid Kingsford and unseated Mr Fawcus. After this grief, Golden Miller&#x27;s task was much easier, and he won by four lengths from Inverse and Aruntius.

In &quot;The History of Steeplechasing&quot;, published in 1966, Roger Mortimer comments that &quot;It took some little time for the racing public to accept Golden Miller as the great horse that he was because he lacked the almost insolent panache of Easter Hero. In a race he was inclined to be idle, while his jumping was quick and economical rather than brilliantly spectacular. He was accustomed to jump off his forehand and was therefore not the ideal horse for Aintree. His class and cleverness, combined with courage and stamina, earned him one Grand National, but in fact he was essentially a park course type. Cheltenham was a track that suited him to perfection, his long stride and apparently boundless stamina earning a rich dividend in that stiff uphill climb to the winning post.&quot;

1933

Golden Miller had improved in the year since his first Gold Cup win. He had been very impressive in winning the Troytown Chase at Lingfield carrying 12 st 10 lbs. He started at 4/7 in the Gold Cup. His opponents included good horses such as Kellsboro&#x27; Jack (who won the Grand National about two weeks later), Thomond II and Delaneige, but he won easily by ten lengths, ridden by Billy Stott.

1934

The Grand National was the main target for Golden Miller. He had a new jockey, Gerry Wilson, with whom he won a race at Lingfield in November 1933. beating Thomond II. But a month after that Thomond II got his revenge when beating Golden Miller at Kempton. In January, at Hurst Park, Golden Miller was beaten by Southern Hero to whom he was giving 28 lbs.

Thomond II did not run in the Gold Cup, for which Golden Miller started at 6/5. There was a lot of support for the seven-year-old El Hadjar, who had won the Coventry Chase at Kempton. El Hadjar and Kellsboro&#x27; Jack moved up to challenge Golden Miller three fences from home, but El Hadjar fell and Kellsboro&#x27; Jack could not sustain his effort, leaving Golden Miller to win by six lengths from Avenger.

Seventeen days later Golden Miller put up the finest performance of his career by winning the Grand National in record time with 12 st 2lbs.

1935

Once again, the Grand National was Golden Miller&#x27;s main objective. He seemed as good as ever when winning the 3m 5f Grand International Chase at Sandown, carrying 12 st 7 lbs, conceding 14 lbs to Delaneige. 

In the Gold Cup, Golden Miller started at 1/2 favourite. His four opponents were Thomond II, Kellsboro&#x27; Jack, Southern Hero and Avenger. There was an enormous crowd on a sunny day. The going was fast, and there was a fierce gallop from the start. By the final fence, Golden Miller and Thomond II had drawn clear of the rest and landed together. There was a fierce tussle up the run in, but Golden Miller managed to win his fourth Gold Cup by three quarters of a length. Roger Mortimer comments that, &quot;It was the hardest race of Golden Miller&#x27;s career and his light never shone so brightly again.&quot;

1936

Golden Miller had a new trainer this year - Owen Anthony. In December 1935 he won a National Hunt flat race. In the same month, carrying 12 st 10 lbs and ridden by Gerry Wilson, he won a two-mile chase at Newbury in great style. In February he returned to the same course, ridden again by Wilson, to run in a three-mile chase. But he was well below his best and ran out five fences from home. In the aftermath of this race it was announced that Evan Williams would ride Golden Miller in the Gold Cup instead of Gerry Wilson. 

Golden Miller&#x27;s task in the Gold Cup was made easier by Thomond II&#x27;s absence, and he started at 21/20 favourite. On his favourite course he won in his old style by twelve lengths from Royal Mail, ridden by Fulke Walwyn. 

In 1937 there was no Cheltenham Gold Cup because of the weather, so Golden Miller had to wait until 1938 to attempt to win it for the sixth time. Although he was in his twelfth year, he started at 7/4 favourite. Ridden by &#x27;Frenchie&#x27; Nicholson, he was just in front at the last fence, but the speed of the younger Morse Code, ridden by Danny Morgan, was too much for him on the run-in and he was beaten by two lengths. 

=== Golden Miller and the Grand National ===
1933 

In 1933, as a six-year-old and winner of two Cheltenham Gold Cups, he started as the 9/1 favourite in the Grand National. He was ridden by Ted Leader, and well placed on the second circuit when he made a bad mistake at Becher&#x27;s. He recovered well but fell at the Canal Turn. The race was won by the seven-year-old Kellsboro&#x27; Jack, ridden by Dudley Williams, trained by Ivor Anthony.

1934

The following year, in the 1934 Grand National, Golden Miller, carrying 12 st 2 lbs, started at 8/1 second favourite. The favourite, Really True, fell at the 26th fence when going well. Golden Miller was ridden by one of the best steeplechase jockeys of the 1930s, Gerry Wilson. At the last fence, Delaneige landed first, but Golden Miller produced a turn of speed and drew clear to beat Delaneige (11st 6 lbs) by five lengths, with Thomond II (12 st 4 lbs) third and the 1932 winner Forbra (11 st 7 lbs) fourth. Golden Miller set a new course record of 9 min 20.4s for Aintree. This victory in the &#x27;National&#x27; came in the middle of five consecutive Gold Cup victories, a Gold Cup record.

1935

Golden Miller was given 12 st 7 lbs to carry in the 1935 Grand National. He started at 2/1. Sadly, the great horse did not complete a circuit. At the 10th fence, the one after Valentine&#x27;s, he screwed badly to the left taking off (some thought he tried to refuse) and landed awkwardly, parting company with Gerry Wilson. It was a long way from the stands so many spectators were dismayed when Golden Miller was absent when the runners came on to the racecourse proper. The race was won by Reynoldstown (11 st 4 lbs), ridden by Mr Frank Furlong, at 22/1.

After the race Golden Miller was examined by vets who could find nothing wrong with him, so it was decided to run him in the Champion Chase the following day (the Grand National was run on Friday until the 1950s). He made a mess of the first fence and unseated Gerry Wilson. As Golden Miller was led back to the paddock there was much booing from the stands.

In the following week there were rumours about Golden Miller and his connections. The horse&#x27;s owner, Dorothy Paget and jockey Gerry Wilson had a less than amicable relationship with the trainer, Basil Briscoe. Miss Paget moved Golden Miller and six other horses from Briscoe to Donald Snow. Miss Paget moved Golden Miller again, in August 1935 to Owen Anthony, where he statyed for the rest of his racing career.

1936

Golden Miller fell at the first fence. Reynoldstown (10/1) won his second successive Grand National carrying 12st 2 lbs, this time ridden by Mr Fulke Walwyn.

1937

Golden Miller ran in his 5th Grand National. He was still only ten years old, and despite failing in the previous two years, the public made him 8/1 favourite. However, Golden Miller by now appeared to dislike Aintree and he refused on the first circuit. The winner was Royal Mail, with Evan Williams up. He carried 11 st 13 lbs, with a starting price of 100/6. 

In the course of his racing career Golden Miller had seventeen jockeys, fifteen professionals and two amateurs, Mr Hector Gordon and Mr Robin Mount.

He retired in 1939, having won 29 of his 52 starts with winnings of £15,000. He is buried at Elsenham Stud, a working farm in Elsenham in north-west Essex.

==Honours==
Fred Varney, a bricklayer, bought a ticket in the Irish sweepstakes and drew Golden Miller. A bookmaker bought a half share in Fred&#x27;s ticket for £3,000. When Golden Miller won, he won the top prize of £30,000. He had to give the bookmakers £15,000, which left Fred with £18,000. With the winnings, Fred and his son-in-law founded a coach company and named it Golden Miller Coaches after the horse. After many years, the company was bought and renamed Tellings-Golden Miller. Many of the firm&#x27;s coaches have a portrait of the horse on the front or side of the vehicle.

A statue of Golden Miller was erected near the parade ring at Cheltenham Racecourse. The racehorse weather vane on top of Hucknall Library, in Nottinghamshire, commemorates Golden Miller: the library was funded by Edward Shipley Ellis and William Paget, two of the partners in the Hucknall Colliery Company.

==Pedigree==
*Golden Miller was inbred 4 × 4 to Sterling, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

<doc id="582576" wikidata="Q158151" url="?curid=582576" title="Saxe-Altenburg">
<text>Saxe-Altenburg () was one of the Saxon duchies held by the Ernestine branch of the House of Wettin in present-day Thuringia. It was one of the smallest of the German states with an area of 1323 square kilometers and a population of 207,000 (1905) of whom about one fifth resided in the capital, Altenburg. The territory of the duchy consisted of two non-contiguous territories separated by land belonging to the Principality of Reuss-Gera. Its economy was based on agriculture, forestry, and small industry. The state had a constitutional monarchical form of government with a parliament composed of thirty members chosen by male taxpayers over 25 years of age.

== Territory ==
Saxe-Altenburg had an area of 1,323 km2 (510 sq. mi.) and a population of 207,000 in 1905. Its capital was Altenburg.

The duchy consisted of two separate areas: the Ostkreis, containing the cities of Altenburg, Schmölln, Gößnitz, Lucka und Meuselwitz (including the exclave of Mumsdorf), Roschütz, Hilbersdorf, Neukirchen by Waldenburg and Rußdorf by Chemnitz; and the Westkreis, which contained the cities of Eisenberg, Kahla, Orlamünde und Roda (including the exclave of Ammelstädt). The Ostkreis roughly corresponds to the modern Altenburger Land district of Thuringia, plus the area around Ronneburg in Greiz. The Westkreis is now mostly in Saale-Holzland district, with small portions in neighbouring districts.
The duchy contained the Pleiße and Saale rivers.

==History==
The duchy had its origins in the medieval Burgraviate of Altenburg in the Imperial Pleissnerland &quot;(Terra Plisensis)&quot;, a possession of the Wettin Margraves of Meissen since 1243. Following the partition of Leipzig in 1485, Altenburg fell to Ernst, Elector of Saxony, the progenitor of the Ernestine Wettins. After the Capitulation of Wittenberg in 1547, the area around Altenburg went to the Albertine Electorate of Saxony, but it was transferred to the Ernestine in the in 1554, and then to the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar following the in 1572.

When Johann Wilhelm&#x27;s son and successor Friedrich Wilhelm I died in 1602, the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar passed to his younger brother Johann II. In 1603 Frederick William&#x27;s eldest son Johann Philipp received the newly created Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg as compensation. It was an Imperial State in its own right, with a vote in the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, for much of the 17th century until the extinction of its ruling line in 1672 when it was inherited by Ernest I the Pious, the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, who had married the heiress.

Saxe-Altenburg thereafter remained part of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg until the extinction of that house in 1825, when Gotha and Altenburg were divided up, with Gotha going to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Altenburg to the Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen, who in exchange gave up Hildburghausen to the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. This family ruled the duchy until the end of the monarchies in the course of the German Revolution of 1918–19. The succeeding Free State of Saxe-Altenburg was incorporated into the new state of Thuringia in 1920.

<text>Dabney Wharton Coleman (January 3, 1932 – May 16, 2024) was an American actor. He was recognized for his roles portraying egomaniacal and unlikeable characters in comedic performances. Throughout his career, he appeared in over 175 films and television programs and received awards for both comedic and dramatic performances.

Coleman&#x27;s notable films include &quot;9 to 5&quot; (1980), &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (1981), &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983), &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; (1984), and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; (1998). His significant television roles included Merle Jeeter on &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; (1976–1977), the title characters in &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; (1983–1984) and &quot;The Slap Maxwell Story&quot; (1987–1988), and Burton Fallin on &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2001–2004). Later in his career, he portrayed Louis &quot;The Commodore&quot; Kaestner on &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot; (2010–2011). His final role was an appearance on &quot;Yellowstone&quot; (2019). As a voice actor, he provided the voice of Principal Peter Prickly on &quot;Recess&quot; (1997–2001) and in several movies based on the series.

Coleman won one Primetime Emmy Award from six nominations and one Golden Globe Award from three nominations.

==Early life==
Dabney Coleman was born the youngest of four children in Austin, Texas, on January 3, 1932, to Randolph and Mary Johns Coleman. His father died from pneumonia when Dabney was four years old. He and three older sisters were then raised by his mother in Corpus Christi, Texas. He attended Corpus Christi High School, where he excelled at tennis and became nationally ranked as a junior tennis player.

In 1949, at the age of 17, he enrolled at Virginia Military Institute, where he studied for two years and competed on the school&#x27;s tennis team. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin for two years, graduating in 1954 with a B.A. in drama. Coleman later recalled that he did not pass many courses and that he was &quot;too busy playing Ping-Pong at the Phi Delta Theta house and calling girls&quot;. He was drafted into the United States Army in 1953 and served in West Germany in the Army&#x27;s Special Services for two years. He later told an interviewer, &quot;I spent my military service either playing or teaching tennis.&quot; After being discharged by the Army in 1955, he returned to the University of Texas at Austin to enroll in law school.

==Career==
===Early career===
Coleman was not doing well in law school, and it seemed unlikely that he would become a lawyer. In 1957, while still in law school, Coleman married Ann Courtney Harrell. Though their marriage only lasted two years, it had a major impact on Coleman&#x27;s career. A 45-minute visit from his wife&#x27;s friend Zachary Scott inspired Coleman to drop out of law school and pursue acting as a career. Coleman recounted, &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget the way he stood and asked if my wife was at home. He had style. In that moment I knew I wanted to be an actor, to be like Zachary Scott. The next day I got on an airplane and flew to New York.&quot;

Once in New York City, Coleman started applying to acting schools. He enrolled in the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, training with Sanford Meisner, and studied there from 1958 to 1960. Meisner told him: &quot;You&#x27;re ideal for us. You&#x27;ve lived some.&quot; Another one of his instructors was the future director Sydney Pollack, with whom Coleman would soon become friends.

Soon after finishing his training under Meisner, Coleman made his Broadway debut in the short-lived &quot;A Call on Kuprin&quot; in 1961. He followed that with summer stock performances on the east coast.

His first television role was on an episode of &quot;Naked City&quot; in 1961, which was filmed on location in New York City and he earned $90 for the role. In 1962, he and his second wife, actress Jean Hale, moved to Los Angeles. He soon signed a contract with Universal and started work in television, appearing as a guest on various shows starting in the early 1960s. For example, in a 1964 episode of the anthology series &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot; titled &quot;The Threatening Eye&quot;, Coleman played private investigator William Gunther.

In 1965, he landed his first movie role in &quot;The Slender Thread&quot;, which was also Pollack&#x27;s directorial debut.

In his first recurring role on television, he played Dr. Leon Bessemer, a neighbor and friend of the protagonist, in the first season of &quot;That Girl&quot; (1966). Other early roles in his career included a U.S. Olympic skiing team coach in &quot;Downhill Racer&quot; (1969), a high-ranking fire chief in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), and a wealthy Westerner in &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; (1975). He portrayed an FBI agent in &quot;Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan&quot; (1975).

In the satirical soap opera &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; (1976–1977), Coleman was initially cast for six episodes as Merle Jeeter, the duplicitous father of a child preacher, but his performance secured him a regular role on the show. The part was also the first time he played an unsavory character for comedic effect, which would become a frequent theme in his career.

In his earliest roles such as in &quot;That Girl&quot;, he did not have facial hair. He first grew the mustache that would be associated with many of his roles in 1973. He later said, &quot;Without the mustache, I looked too much like Richard Nixon.&quot; He also reflected, &quot;There&#x27;s no question that when I grew that mustache, all of a sudden, everything changed.&quot;

===&quot;9 to 5&quot; and leading roles===

Coleman landed the role of primary antagonist Franklin Hart Jr. in the 1980 film &quot;9 to 5&quot;, in which he portrayed a sexist boss on whom three female office employees get their revenge. It was this film that firmly established Coleman in the character type with which he was most identified, and frequently played afterwards—a comic relief villain. Coleman followed &quot;9 to 5&quot; with the role of the arrogant, sexist, soap opera director in &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), also directed by Sydney Pollack. He also portrayed a con artist Broadway producer in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984), played the nefarious raisin tycoon Tyler Cane in the satirical miniseries &quot;Fresno&quot; (1986), and evoked Hugh Hefner as a lisping magazine mogul in the comedy &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1987).

Coleman broke from type somewhat in other film roles. He appeared in the feature film &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (1981), playing the sympathetic fiancé of Chelsea Thayer Wayne (Jane Fonda). He also played a military computer scientist in &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983), and he played a dual role as a loving but busy father, as well as his son&#x27;s imaginary hero, in &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; (1984). Coleman played an aging cop who thinks he is terminally ill in the 1990 comedy &quot;Short Time&quot;.

While Coleman frequently transitioned between roles in film and television, it was his television performances that earned him the most formal recognition and awards. He received his first Emmy Award nomination for his lead role as a skilled but self-centered TV host in &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;. In 1987, he received an Emmy Award for his role in the television film &quot;Sworn to Silence&quot;. Later that year, Coleman starred in &quot;The Slap Maxwell Story&quot; (1987–1988), playing a cantankerous sportswriter. Although the show was short-lived, Coleman won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy for the role in 1988.

Despite these accolades, many of Coleman&#x27;s television shows, including award-winning shows like &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; and &quot;The Slap Maxwell Story&quot;, were noted for struggles with low ratings and brief runs. Other series he appeared in, like &quot;Drexell&#x27;s Class&quot; (1991–1992) and &quot;Madman of the People&quot; (1994–1995), faced similar challenges.

===Other roles===
In other comedic film roles, he played Bobcat Goldthwait&#x27;s boss in the 1988 talking-horse comedy &quot;Hot to Trot&quot;, and befuddled banker Milburn Drysdale in the feature film &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1993), which reunited him with &quot;9 to 5&quot; co-stars Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. Continuing his streak of comic foils, Coleman played Charles Grodin&#x27;s sleazy boss, Gerald Ellis, in &quot;Clifford&quot; (1994), co-starring Martin Short. From 1997 to 2001, Coleman provided the voice of Principal Prickly on the animated series &quot;Recess&quot; and several films based on the series. He also played a philandering father in &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; (1998), and a police chief in &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; (which reunited him with his &quot;WarGames&quot; co-star Matthew Broderick).

===Later career===

In his later career, Coleman took on more consistently serious roles, notably portraying Burton Fallin in the TV series &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2001–2004). In an interview with the Associated Press, Coleman described his dream job as a &quot;serious show about a serious subject, good writing, good actors&quot; and said that his role on &quot;The Guardian&quot; was &quot;kind of that dream come true&quot;. He also appeared as a casino owner in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Domino&quot;. In 2009, Coleman served as an interviewer and participant in &quot;Char·ac·ter&quot;, a documentary about the craft of acting with Peter Falk, Charles Grodin, Sydney Pollack, Mark Rydell, and Harry Dean Stanton. For two seasons, from 2010 to 2011, Coleman was a series regular on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, sharing two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

On November 6, 2014, Coleman received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was honored with the 2017 Mary Pickford Award for his contributions to the entertainment industry.

His final roles included a small part in Warren Beatty&#x27;s comedy &quot;Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot; in 2016, and a guest role in 2019 as Kevin Costner&#x27;s dying father in &quot;Yellowstone&quot;, which would be his final role.

==Personal life==
Coleman was married to Ann Courtney Harrell from 1957 to 1959 and Jean Hale from 1961 to 1983. He had four children, Meghan, Kelly, Randy, and Quincy.

Coleman was a tennis player, winning celebrity and charity tournaments. He played mainly at the Riviera Country Club as well as in local tournaments. He was also known for being a regular at Dan Tana&#x27;s restaurant in West Hollywood, where a large New York Steak is named after him. When Coleman received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an after party was held at Dan Tana&#x27;s to celebrate the occasion. His favorite sports team was the St. Louis Browns, which are now the Baltimore Orioles.

In the 1980s and 1990s, it was noted by several journalists that Coleman chain-smoked cigarettes during his interviews. He was described as a &quot;lean and impossibly fit-looking 62 years old&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1994. In 2011, Coleman started treatment for throat cancer, which sometimes affected his ability to speak. The diagnosis led to a rapid rewrite and early filming of his scenes for the second season of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;. In a 2012 interview, he discussed his experience filming the series while dealing with cancer, lighting up a cigarette at one point during the interview, and mentioned that he no longer had cancer.

==Death==
Coleman died at his home in Santa Monica, California, on May 16, 2024, at age 92, of cardiac arrest due to dysphagia and heart failure.

<doc id="582586" wikidata="Q157710" url="?curid=582586" title="Saxe-Meiningen">
<text>Saxe-Meiningen ( ; ) was one of the Saxon duchies held by the Ernestine line of the House of Wettin, located in the southwest of the present-day German state of Thuringia.

Established in 1681, by partition of the Ernestine Duchy of Saxe-Gotha among the seven sons of deceased Duke Ernest the Pious, the Saxe-Meiningen line of the House of Wettin lasted until the end of the German monarchies in 1918.

==History==

===House of Wettin===
The Wettiner had been the rulers of sizeable holdings in today&#x27;s states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia since the Middle Ages. In the &quot;Leipziger Teilung&quot; of 1485, the Wettiner were split into two branches named after their founding princes Albrecht and Ernst (&quot;albertinisch&quot; and &quot;ernestinisch&quot;). Thuringia was part of the Ernestine holdings of &quot;Kursachsen&quot; (the Electorate of Saxony). In 1572, the branches Saxe-Coburg-Eisenach and Saxe-Weimar were established there. The senior line again split in 1641/41 into three duchies, including the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha.

Duke Ernst I who founded this duchy with its seat at Gotha opposed the system of primogeniture. As a result, on his death in 1675 all of his sons inherited part of his holdings and were supposed to rule under the leadership of his oldest son. In practice, this proved very complicated and brought on three settlements in 1679, 1680 and 1681 that established the following princedoms: Saxe-Gotha (Friedrich), Saxe-Coburg (Albrecht), Saxe-Meiningen (Bernhard), Saxe-Eisenberg (Christian), Saxe-Hildburghausen (Ernst) and Saxe-Saalfeld (Johann Ernst).

===Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen===
Bernhard, Ernst I&#x27;s third son, received the town of Meiningen as well as several other holdings (Wasungen und Salzungen, Maßfeld und Sand, Herrenbreitungen, Herpf, Stepfershausen, Utendorf, Mehlis and the former Franconian lands of the extinct House of Henneberg, Henneberg).

Bernhard chose the town of Meiningen as his residence and became the first duke of Saxe-Meiningen. From 1682 Duke Bernhard I had the Schloss Elisabethenburg built and in 1690 established the Court Orchestra (&quot;Hofkapelle&quot;), in which Johann Ludwig Bach later became the &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; (1711).

In the reshuffle of Ernestine territories that occurred following the extinction of the Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg line upon the death of Duke Frederick IV in 1825, Duke Bernhard II of Saxe-Meiningen received the lands of the former Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen as well as the Saalfeld territory of the former Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld duchy.

As Bernhard II had supported Austria in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, the prime minister of victorious Prussia, Otto von Bismarck, enforced his abdication in favour of his son George II, after which Saxe-Meiningen was admitted to join the North German Confederation.

By 1910, the duchy had grown to and 278,762 inhabitants. The ducal summer residence was at Altenstein Castle. Since 1868, the duchy comprised the &quot;Kreise&quot; (districts) of Hildburghausen, Sonneberg and Saalfeld as well as the northern exclaves of Camburg and Kranichfeld.

===End of the Duchy===
In the German Revolution after World War I, Duke Bernhard III, brother-in-law of Emperor Wilhelm II, was forced to abdicate and his brother Ernst on 11/12 November 1918 refused the succession. The succeeding &quot;Free State of Saxe-Meiningen&quot; was merged into the new state of Thuringia on 1 May 1920.
