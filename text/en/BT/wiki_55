<doc id="574156" wikidata="Q698215" url="?curid=574156" title="Holy League (1571)">
<text>The Holy League (, , ) of 1571 was arranged by Pope Pius V and included the major Catholic powers of southern Europe (Iberian Peninsula and Italian Peninsula), specifically the Spanish Empire as well as the Italian maritime powers.
It was intended to break the Ottoman Empire’s control of the eastern Mediterranean Sea and was formally concluded on 25 May 1571.
==Members==
The League&#x27;s members were:
* the Papal States under Pius V,
* Spanish Empire under Philip II (including Naples and Sicily),
* the Republic of Venice,
* the Republic of Genoa,
* the Knights of Malta,
* the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Order of Saint Stephen under Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici,
* the Duchy of Savoy under Emmanuel Philibert,
* the Duchy of Urbino under Guidobaldo II della Rovere,
* the Duchy of Parma under Ottavio Farnese.
==Forces and strength==
These Christian states were to have a force of 200 galleys, 100 other ships, 50,000 infantry, 4,500 cavalry and adequate artillery ready by 1 April each year. John of Austria, illegitimate half-brother of King Philip II of Spain, was designated supreme commander.
The League kept membership open for the Holy Roman Empire, France and Portugal, but none of them joined. The Empire preferred to maintain its truce with Istanbul, while France had an active anti-Spanish alliance with the Ottomans. Portugal had no forces to spare, owing to its heavy engagement in its own Moroccan campaign, its ongoing maritime confrontations with the Ottomans in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, and colonial conflicts with the Malaccan and Johorean Sultanates.
==Engagements==
The League initially assembled a fleet to aid the Venetian defenders of Cyprus which was invaded by Ottoman forces under the command of Lala Mustafa in July 1570, but was too late to prevent the island&#x27;s capture by the Ottomans.

On 7 October 1571, the League won a decisive victory over the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in the Gulf of Patras. The fleet of the Holy League in this engagement consisted of 212 warships (206 galleys and 6 galleasses, the modern large galleys developed by Venice) with 1,815 guns and carrying 28,500 infantry soldiers. The majority of warships were Venetian (6 galleasses, 109 galleys), the next largest contingent were Spanish (49 galleys, including 26 galleys from Naples, Sicily and other Italian territories), and Genoese (27 galleys), with additional warships from the Papal States (seven galleys), the Order of Saint Stephen from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (five galleys), the Duchy of Savoy and the Knights of Malta (three galleys each), and some privately owned galleys in Spanish service.

The victory at Lepanto confirmed the &quot;de facto&quot; division of the Mediterranean, with the eastern half under firm Ottoman control and the western half under the Habsburgs and their Italian allies.

The following year, as the allied Christian fleet resumed operations, it faced a renewed Ottoman navy of 200 vessels under Kılıç Ali Pasha, but the Ottoman commander actively avoided engaging the allied fleet and headed for the safety of the fortress of Modon. The arrival of the Spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow, but friction among the Christian leaders and the reluctance of Don John squandered the opportunity. the holy league attempted to capture Navarino but failed.
==Demise==
Pius V died on 1 May 1572. The diverging interests of the League members began to show, and the alliance began to unravel. In 1573, the Holy League fleet failed to sail altogether; instead, Don John attacked and took Tunis, only for it to be retaken by the Ottomans in 1574. Venice, fearing the loss of her Dalmatian possessions and a possible invasion of Friuli, and eager to cut her losses and resume the trade with the Ottoman Empire, initiated unilateral negotiations with the Porte. The Holy League was disbanded with the peace treaty of 7 March 1573, which concluded the War of Cyprus.

<doc id="574160" wikidata="Q69849" url="?curid=574160" title="Julius von Verdy du Vernois">
<text>Adrian Friedrich Wilhelm Julius Ludwig von Verdy du Vernois (19 July 1832 – 30 September 1910), often given the short name of Verdy, was a German general and staff officer, chiefly noted both for his military writings and his service on Helmuth von Moltke the Elder&#x27;s staff during the Franco-Prussian War.

==Life and career==
Verdy was born in Freystadt, Province of Silesia, and entered the Prussian Army in 1850. After some years of regimental service he came to the attention of Graf Moltke, the newly appointed Chief of the Prussian General Staff, and at the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War (1866) he was appointed major on the staff of the Second Army (commanded by Crown Prince Frederick). He took part in the campaign on the upper Elbe and participated in the Battle of Königgrätz, which saw the defeat of the Austrians.

Promoted shortly after this to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, in 1867 Verdy was placed at the head of the intelligence section of the general staff, becoming thereby one of Moltke&#x27;s principal confidential assistants. In this capacity he served at the headquarters of the German army throughout the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), and became known as one of Moltke&#x27;s famed &quot;demigods.&quot;

At the close of the war he continued to serve on the general staff, and also lectured at the Prussian Military Academy. It was in the latter position that he developed the system of thorough tactical education which is considered the abiding result of his work. His method may be studied in English translations of his &quot;Studies in Troop-leading&quot;, and may be summarized as the assumption of an actual military situation on the actual ground, followed by critical discussion of the successive measures that a commander, whether of a brigade, division or larger force, should take in the sequel, given his orders and his knowledge of the general situation. Moltke&#x27;s own series of tactical problems, extending from 1859 to 1889, contributed very powerfully, of course, to the education of the selected young officers who passed through Verdy&#x27;s hands, but Moltke dealt rather with a great number of separate problems, while Verdy developed in detail the successive events and ruling ideas of a whole day&#x27;s or week&#x27;s work in the same units. Moltke therefore may be said to have developed the art of forming correct ideas and plans, Verdy that of applying them, but these are after all merely tendencies, not sharply divided schemes, in the teaching of Prussian staff officers during the years of intellectual development between 1870 and 1888. In all this Moltke, Verdy and Paul Bronsart von Schellendorff worked in close co-operation.

In 1876 Verdy was promoted to &quot;Generalmajor&quot;, from 1879 to 1883 he held an important position in the ministry of war, and in 1881 he was promoted lieutenant-general. In 1887 he became governor of Strasbourg, in 1888 was promoted to General of the Infantry. From 1889 to 1890 he served as Prussian Minister of War, after which he retired from the active list. In 1894 the University of Königsberg made him a Dr. Phil, &quot;honoris causa&quot;.

Julius von Verdy du Vernois died in 1910 aged 78.

<doc id="574162" wikidata="Q51653" url="?curid=574162" title="Crusade of 1101">
<text>The Crusade of 1101, also known as the Crusade of the Faint-Hearted, was launched in the aftermath of the First Crusade with calls for reinforcements from the newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem. Pope Paschal II, successor to Urban II (who died before learning of the outcome of the crusade that he had called), urged a new expedition. He especially urged those who had taken the crusade vow but had never departed, and those who had turned back while on the march. The crusade was a resounding defeat of the West by the Seljuk Turks.

==Background==

The First Crusade was over and many of the Crusaders who participated returned to Europe. They had just taken over the Holy City of Jerusalem and had defeated the Fatimid counterattack at the Battle of Ascalon. Leaders Robert Curthose of Normandy and Robert of Flanders left Godfrey of Bouillon to defend Jerusalem with only 300 men.

One of these people was the Archbishop of Pisa, Dagobert of Pisa. Realizing the need to expand Pisa&#x27;s influence east, a move already done by Republic of Venice and Genoa. After being made legate by Pope Paschal II, he set off to the Levant with a fleet of 120 ships which, on their way, made successful raids on Byzantine owned islands like Cephalonia and Corfu. After hearing about this news, Eastern Roman Emperor Alexios I Komnenos dispatched the Byzantine navy which skirmished with the Pisans who, after few skirmishes, left for the Outremer.

One of the Crusader leaders, Bohemond of Antioch, was besieging the Byzantine port of Latakia, and Dagobert and the Pisans agreed to help by blockading the port from the sea. However, the other Crusader leaders, who saw the necessity for cooperation with the Byzantine Emperor and eastern Christians, were horrified and persuaded Dagobert to call off the blockade. Bohemond was forced to abandon the siege, and accompanied Dagobert to Jerusalem, arriving on 21 December 1099.

Immediately after Christmas, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Arnulf of Chocques, was deposed on the ground that his election had been uncanonical, and with Bohemond&#x27;s support, Dagobert was elected in his place. Public opinion had always held that the Holy Land should be the patrimony of the church, but Arnulf had been too weak to establish supremacy. Dagobert&#x27;s position was stronger, as he was (probably) papal legate and had the support of the Pisan fleet. Immediately after his enthronement, Godfrey of Bouillon knelt before him and was invested with the territory of Jerusalem, and Bohemond did the same for Antioch. Baldwin, was at this time Count of Edessa, but he did not pay homage to Dagobert. This connection with Pisa now meant that the Crusaders had a line of communication with Western Europe and now did not need to rely on Eastern Roman supply shipments.

==Cause of the Crusade==

===Bohemond&#x27;s Capture===
In the May of the year 1100, an Armenian warlord Gabriel of Melitene took the city of Melitene from an Anatolian Turkic Beylik called the Danishmendids. When he received reports that the Danishmendid Bey Gazi Gümüshtigin of Sebastea was preparing an expedition to recapture Melitene he sought help from Bohemond and even offered his daughter in marriage.

Before the First Crusade, Alexios, the Eastern Roman Emperor, had made Bohemond of Taranto promise to give whatever land he conquered east of Antioch to him. But after the Siege of Antioch, where the Crusaders took Antioch from the Seljuk Empire, Bohemond took the city for himself, founding the Principality of Antioch with himself the Prince of Antioch. In doing this action he had broken his oath to Alexios. For this reason, at around the same time as Bohemond received the cry of help from the Armenians of Melitene, Alexios pressured Bohemond to furfill his oath and to surrender Antioch to the Eastern Romans. But Bohemond refused so the Byzantine navy took the important Cilician ports of Seleucia Trachea and Corycos from Antioch. In response, Bohemond replaced the Greek patriarch of Antioch, John the Oxite with a Latin one named Peter of Narbonne. Bohemond needed to expand his base, so he decided to help the Armenians in Melitene.

So, Bohemond got his army and ventured out to Melitene to fight the Danishmendids. But at the Battle of Melitene, the Danishmendids under Gazi Gümüshtigin ambushed the expedition and &quot;most of the Crusaders were killed.&quot; Bohemond was captured along with Richard of Salerno. Among the dead were the Armenian bishops of Marash and Antioch. Bohemond&#x27;s followers who were captured in the battle were killed and Bohemond and Richard of Salerno were imprisoned at Neocaesarea, which is modern-day Niksar. Alexios offered to pay 260,000 gold pieces as ransom, way more than the 100,000 the Danishmendids asked for, not to free him but to keep him in custody at Constantinople, but the Danishmendids refused. While Bohemond was imprisoned at Neocaesarea, his nephew, Tancred of Galilee, took control of the city, defending it from the Byzantines. The Eastern Romans meanwhile took control of the lands surrounding the port city of Latakia, Albara, and Maarat-al-Numan, lands that were immediately to the south of Antioch. Then Alexios had the Byzantines take over Cilicia, lands which were north of Antioch, Alexios did this to take over the lands around the Principality of Antioch and then to squeeze it to extinction.

===Coronation of Baldwin I===

Godfrey of Bouillon, the King of Jerusalem was busy making the Muslim-Levantine cities of Acre, Jaffa, Caesarea Maritima, Ascalon, and Arsuf tributaries. These campaigns culminated at the First siege of Arsuf, originally called Apollonia, and was controlled by the Shiite Muslim Fatimid Caliphate, which was based in Egypt. Godfrey had earlier reached an agreement with the citizens of Arsuf after it was known that he intended to stay in Jerusalem and reconciled with Raymond of Toulouse, who was attempting to create a kingdom of his own in the Levant. The treaty stated that Arsuf would pay tribute to Godfrey and included an exchange of hostages that included Godfrey&#x27;s knight, Gerard of Avesnes. However the Muslim hostages escaped, giving Arsuf no reason to pay their tribute. Godfrey subsequently besieged the city in October. During this siege, Godfrey first spent six weeks building mangonels or stone throwers, which were used to support two siege towers. The number of Godfrey&#x27;s men, however, was severely reduced after most of the crusaders returned back to Europe via Latakia. In the end the two assaults made on Arsuf were defeated when the garrison set the siege towers on fire. Godfrey was left with no options and ended the siege.
During the siege, while the Crusaders pounded the walls with catapults, the Fatimids had Gerard hung from the mast of an old ship that had been lying in the city. They raised Gerard up to be in view of the attacking Crusaders. Gerard begged Godfrey to take pity on him. Godfrey responded that while Gerard was the bravest of knights, but he could not call off the attack. Godfrey said that it was better for Gerard to be the sole casualty than to Arsuf to remain a danger to Christian pilgrims. Gerard then asked that his property be donated to the Holy Sepulchre, of which Godfrey was Defender, instead of the king. The Crusaders continued their attack. Gerard was wounded multiple times, though he managed to survive and make it back to Jerusalem. The Fatimid governor offered to surrender to Raymond of Saint-Gilles, the only Crusader leader during the First Crusade who managed to stop the Crusaders from ransacking towns they took and massacring its Muslim inhabitants. Insulted, Godfrey refused. Raymond even encouraged the garrison at Arsuf to hold out against Godfrey, touting his perceived weakness. This would cause Godfrey to blame him again (Raymond had done the same thing after the Battle of Ascalon) for the failure of his army to capture Arsuf. Within Godfrey&#x27;s army, Franco I of Maasmechelen, a relative of Godfrey, is known to have died in the battle. After the siege, In the May of the year 1100, one of the last leaders of the 1st Crusade still in the Holy Land, Raymond of Toulouse, left for the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, Constantinople to ask the Byzantine Emperor, Alexios I Komnenos, for help to carve out his own kingdom around the Seljuk-controlled Levantine city of Tripoli.

During these campaigns Godfrey suddenly fell ill. After being ill for a month and a half, Godfrey died on 18July 1100. He had extracted oaths from Dagobert and other leading crusaders that they &quot;would not confer the throne on anyone except his brothers or one of his blood&quot;, according to Albert of Aix. Warner of Grez, Godfrey&#x27;s most influential retainer, took possession of the Tower of David in Jerusalem to secure control of the city while others loyal to Godfrey took other towers to prevent Dagobert annexing the Holy City for the Papal States. Although Warner soon died, two other members of Godfrey&#x27;s court, Geldemar Carpenel and Arnulf of Chocques, sent a delegation to Godfrey&#x27;s brother, Count Baldwin of Edessa, urging him to come to Jerusalem and become king.

To prevent Baldwin from seizing Godfrey&#x27;s realm, Dagobert and Tancred sought assistance from Bohemond I of Antioch. Dagobert sent a letter to him, stating that Baldwin&#x27;s rule would &quot;bring about the downfall of the church and the destruction of Christianity itself&quot;, according to later chronicler William of Tyre even though he was captured. Baldwin hurried to Melitene and pursued the Danishmendids for three days, but he was unable to rescue Bohemond. After his return, the Armenian lord of Melitene, Gabriel of Melitene, swore fealty to him. Baldwin appointed fifty knights to defend the town.

News of Godfrey&#x27;s death reached Edessa shortly after Baldwin&#x27;s return from Melitene. His chaplain, Fulcher of Chartres, noticed that Baldwin &quot;grieved somewhat over the death of his brother, but rejoiced more over his inheritance&quot;. To finance his journey to Jerusalem, Baldwin seized gold and silver from his subjects. He appointed his relative, Baldwin of Le Bourcq, his successor in the county and Le Bourcq swore fealty to him.
About 200 knights and 300–700 foot-soldiers accompanied Baldwin when he left Edessa on 2October 1100. He spent four days in Antioch, but did not accept the local inhabitants&#x27; plea for him to administer the principality during Bohemond&#x27;s captivity. After leaving Antioch, the qadi of Tripoli warned Baldwin that the Seljuk emir of Damascus, Shams al-Muluk Duqaq, wanted to ambush him on the narrow road near the mouth of the Nahr al-Kalb River. At the Battle of Nahr al-Kalb, Baldwin routed the Damascene troops. Baldwin then chased Shams al-Muluk Duqaq all the way to Damascus, where he demanded for the city to surrender to him but they did not.

Baldwin reached Jerusalem around 9November. Dagobert withdrew to a monastery on Mount Zion, and the townspeople stopped Baldwin outside the walls and ceremoniously accompanied him to the Holy Sepulchre. Albert of Aix&#x27;s sporadic references suggest that Baldwin adopted the title of prince. Baldwin first raided the surroundings of Ascalon, which was still held by the Fatimid Caliphate, then launched a punitive expedition against the bandits who had their headquarters in the caves near Jerusalem. He made an incursion across the River Jordan before returning to Jerusalem on 21 December.

Baldwin was reconciled with Dagobert who agreed to anoint and crown him king. The ceremony took place in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem on Christmas Day. Thereafter Baldwin was most frequently styled king. For instance, a charter of grant in 1104 referred to him as &quot;Baldwin, king of Judea and Jerusalem, and defensor of the Holiest Sepulchre of our Lord, Jesus Christ&quot;. In most of his charters, he also emphasised that he was Godfrey&#x27;s lawful heir. Nearby towns would then send Baldwin gifts to ensure his good will.

But soon a crisis emerged. Tancred, Prince of Galilee, did not recognize Baldwin as king. Not only that, Baldwin&#x27;s ally, Geldemar Carpenel laid claim to Haifa, which was part of Tancred&#x27;s Principality of Galilee, stating that Tancred had arbitrarily seized it, The new King of Jerusalem, Baldwin I of Jerusalem summoned Tancred to Jerusalem, but although Tancred did not recognise him as the lawful King of Jerusalem, they agreed to meet at a river near Jaffa. They met, but their meeting did not result in compromise. The conflict was resolved when Tancred was invited to Antioch to administer the principality on Bohemond&#x27;s behalf. Noblemen had come from the Principality of Antioch and asked Tancred to assume the administration of the principality on behalf of his relative, Bohemond I of Antioch, who had been captured by Turkish troops at the Battle of Melitene. Tancred accepted the offer and renounced Galilee in March 1101, but he also stipulated that the king should grant the same land &quot;as a fief&quot; to him if he returned to the kingdom within fifteen months. Before leaving for Antioch in March, Tancred renounced his domains in Palestine, but also stipulated that the same domains should be granted in fief to him if he were to leave Antioch within fifteen months. Baldwin gave Haifa to Geldemar and the Galilee to Hugh of Fauquembergues.

== Franco-Lombard Expedition ==

In the west, the pope started calling a crusade for the rescue of Bohemond from the Danishmendids at Neocaesarea and to reinforce the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Pope Paschal II purposely targeted the places in Europe who previously did not send many crusaders in the First Crusade. This led to many people from many different nations or ethnicities joining either to save Bohemond of Taranto, whose heroic actions during the First Crusade made himself a hero to many Europeans, or to repair their reputations after deserting the First Crusade. Some people who deserted the First Crusade were people like Hugh of Vermandois, who was the prince of France, and Count Stephen of Blois. Apparently, Countess Adela of Blois was so ashamed of her husband, Count Stephen, who had fled from the siege of Antioch in 1098, that she would not permit him to stay at home.

The largest contingent was sent by the region of Lombardy. The Lombards were led by the archbishop of Milan, Anselm IV, a man who was personally selected by the Pope Paschal II to lead the upcoming crusade. Anselm preached the crusade throughout Lombardy, where there had been little enthusiasm for the first one, but where his influence sparked a wave of zeal: crowds greeted him chanting &quot;Ultreja! Ultreja!&quot; On 15 July 1100, he celebrated the anniversary of the fall of Jerusalem in Milan. He appointed one Grossolano, then bishop of Savona, to act as his vicar and, on 13 September, with bishops Guy of Tortona, William of Pavia, and probably Aldo of Piacenza, and with princes like Milo I of Montlhéry, Guy II the Red of Rochefort,he left with a company reported at the exaggerated figure of 50,000 men, led by Albert of Biandrate, and his nephew Otto Altaspata. Albert, Count of Parma, the brother of the Antipope Guibert, was there as a representative of the resolution of the church-state conflicts which enveloped Lombardy in the final decades of the eleventh century. Their group was at least 10,000 strong with many excellent knights.

The army proceeded by land first through the Italo-Alpine region of Carnia, then through Carinthia, with the permission of Duke Henry V of Carinthia, and then went through the Sava valley (part of the Kingdom of Hungary then) before entering Byzantine territory through Belgrade. From here the Byzantine Greeks provided them with privileged markets and supplies due to Anselm&#x27;s negotiations with Alexios I Komnenos, the Eastern Roman emperor. Due to the amount of crusaders, Anselm decided to split the army into three groups, the first near Philippopolis, the next near Adrianople, and the other one near Rodosto. This enabled the crusader army to pass through Thrace to Constantinople without incident. When Anselm and his 10,000 group of Crusaders reached the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, Constantinople, Alexios I escorted them to a camp outside the Walls of Constantinople. At this point sources claim that order was held by Anselm and Albert with ease. But some other sources also claim that this camp did not satisfy the Italian crusaders, and they made their way inside the city where they pillaged the Blachernae palace, even killing Alexios&#x27; pet lion. The Lombards were quickly ferried across the Bosporus and made their camp at Nicomedia, to wait for reinforcements.

At Nicomedia, in Asia Minor, Anselm met Raymond IV of Toulouse, one of the leading barons of the capture of Jerusalem. During the First Crusade, Raymond had tried to carve out a domain for himself in the Levant but had failed. First, after the Crusaders had taken Antioch after its siege, Raymond had attempted to take the city for himself, but Bohemond of Taranto had taken it before him and created the Principality of Antioch for himself, making himself the Prince of Antioch. Then, Raymond attempted to make himself the ruler of Jerusalem after the Siege of Jerusalem (1099), but that scheme failed as well and Godfrey of Bouillon became its first king. Then after the Battle of Ascalon, he had tried to take Ascalon, Tripoli, and Arsuf (check the Siege of Arsuf in the Coronation of Baldwin section) for himself too. Unfortunately, all of those schemes failed. After the failure of his schemes, Raymond had fled with the Crusaders still loyal to him and, in the winter of 1099–1100, captured Laodicea from him (Bohemond had himself recently taken it from Alexios). From Laodicea he went to Constantinople, and pledged his allegiance to Alexios, as his interests aligned with Alexios. Also, both Raymond and Alexios considered Bohemond an enemy due to his control of Antioch. Now Alexios had ordered Raymond, with his contingent of loyal Crusaders, Pechenegs under General Tzitas, and Byzantine Greeks to lead Anselm&#x27;s army through Anatolia towards Neocaesarea, to rescue Bohemond of Taranto. Raymond and his group of loyal Crusaders had already successfully gone through Seljuk Anatolia once before, and in doing so, taking over Western and Southern Anatolia to the Byzantines. It made sense for them to lead Anselm through Anatolia again.

But after Raymond and Anselm met, they already started to disagree. Raymond wanted to lead the Crusaders through the route he had gone upon during the First Crusade and reinforce the Kingdom of Jerusalem. But Anselm and the Italian Crusaders wanted to go on a route directly towards Neocaesarea to rescue Bohemond, a dangerous route that led them through the heart of Turkish Anatolia, controlled by the Sultanate of Rum. The Crusader army ended up going on this route. While waiting at Nicomedia, Anselm&#x27;s army got more reinforcements including French, Germans, and Burgundians. This 8,000 strong army was led by Stephen of Blois, Count Stephen of Burgundy, Duke Eudes of Burgundy, Joscelin of Courtenay, Baldwin of Grandpré, Dodo of Clermont-en-Argonne, Engelrand of Coucy, Bishop of Laon, Hugh of Die, Archbishop of Lyons, Hugh Bardoul (Bardolf) II of Broyes, Viscount Odo Arpin of Bourges, and Conrad, constable of Emperor Henry IV. Many of these Crusaders sold all their possessions to provision themselves with equipment, horses, fodder, and money for the journey, betting everything they had on this mission. These Franco-German Crusaders, with the support of Alexios was assigned command of the entire Crusader army, although the Lombards were reluctant to do so.

Guided by Raymond, the Crusader army, joined by his band of loyal Crusaders, Pechenegs, and Eastern Romans marched through Anatolia. The army first went towards Dorylaeum, following the route taken by Raymond and Stephen in 1097 during the First Crusade. But due to the protests of the Lombards, who wanted to free Bohemond and so go to the more direct, but dangerous route through Seljuk Asia Minor to Neocaesarea Then the army turned east and captured the Seljuk controlled city of Ancyra on 23 June 1101. After returning it to Alexios, the Crusaders turned north. As they started their march north towards Gangra, the crusaders did not realize that they were being followed and watched by Seljuk spies sent by the Seljuk Sultan of Rum Kilij Arslan I. The sultan, who wanted revenge after the First Crusade&#x27;s capture of his previous capital at Nicaea and the Byzantine occupation of Western and Southern Anatolia, now saw his opportunity to destroy the Crusader army. After his defeat at the Battle of Dorylaeum in 1097, Kilij Arslan had been creating an anti-Crusader coalition with the purpose of ending more Crusader invasions of Seljuk Anatolia. Arslan knew the land well and would not underestimate the Crusaders like he had done during the First Crusade. With the Crusaders heading for Gangra, Arslan employed the scorched earth tactic or Fabian strategy. Kilij Arslan poisoned as many wells and cisterns as he could, emptied as many villages or towns the Crusaders were heading towards, and he had Seljuks harass, skirmish, attack, and kill isolated Crusaders, Christian foraging parties, and their supply lines. But most importantly, Arslan avoided any pitched battles. Arslan&#x27;s coalition included his Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, the Danishmendid Emirate of Sivas, and the Emir of Aleppo, Fakhr al-Mulk Ridwan.

The Crusaders briefly unsuccessfully besieged the heavily garrisoned city of Gangra. Raymond suggested for the Crusaders to continue north to attempt to capture the Turkish-controlled city of Kastamone. He probably did this in an attempt to get more in favor with Alexios, whose Komnenos family originated from there before the Seljuk Empire had taken it. It was on the march to Kastamone that the Seljuk harassment got worse. By the time the Crusaders took Kastamone, they were starving, thirsty, and wary of the Seljuks. Their constant raids and surprise attacks had weakened the Crusaders, and whenever some knights tried to pursue, they would find themselves fallen into a feigned retreat and would get killed. The Seljuk attacks caused scouts and foragers to be sent rarely, exacerbating the Crusaders&#x27; hunger, isolation, and demoralization further. After taking Kastamone and returning it back to the Byzantines, the Crusaders now made a decision. Raymond and the Franco-Germans knew that it was best for them to head up to the Black Sea coast and enter Byzantine controlled Paphlagonia, from where they could resupply and regroup, far from the attacking Seljuks. Unfortunately they ended up marching again through the hostile Seljuk Anatolia to Neocaesarea, due to the behest of the Lombards, ever so-desperate to rescue Bohemond. After leaving Kastamone, it became August, and the Crusaders continued east towards Neocaesarea, soon to enter the territory of the Danishmendids. By this time the Crusaders were losing supplies, and the heat had taken a big toll on them. The heat during the August of the Kastamonu area, is now around 84 degrees fahrenheit, and shows us what temperature the Crusaders had to face daily. The heat put many Crusaders to the test, putting them at risk of heat stroke and death, made even worse by their heavy equipment and marching. Worse, they came under attack from the Seljuk Turks, who harassed them for weeks, and a foraging party was destroyed in July. At this point, under the threats of the Lombards, the entire army turned away from the possible safety of the Byzantine controlled Black Sea coast and again moved east, through Danishmend territory and getting closer to the rescue of Bohemond.

===Battle of Mersivan===
After crossing the Halys River the Crusaders entered the territory of the Danishmends, sacking a village of Christian Byzantine Greeks while doing so. Soon the Crusaders approached the walls of Mersivan.

As the Crusaders were marching towards Mersivan they were organized into 5 divisions, the Lombards in the front of the column led by Anselm IV, followed by Raymond IV of Toulouse with the Pechenegs. After Raymond were the Burgundians led by Count Stephen I of Burgundy and Duke Eudes I of Burgundy. After the Burgundians came the Germans led by the German constable Conrad, and then the French led by Stephen of Blois. This army had weak horses and was tired after the long march through Anatolia. Also, due to the massive size of the army, communication between each of the contingents was slow. As the army marched towards Mersivan, they had found themselves surrounded by a Seljuk army led by Kilij Arslan I himself. Kilij Arslan had the Seljuks cut off the crusading armies&#x27; advances and surrounded the Crusaders to block off any routes of escape. In reaction to the Seljuks, the Crusaders created a camp and filled it with the camp followers and supplies, deploying themselves all around the camp with the intention of protecting it. The Seljuks then proceeded to ride around the camp on their swift horses and shoot endless streams of arrows along with many ferocious shouts.

The next day, the German constable, Conrad led a group of German crusaders in an attempt to break the Seljuk lines, but the attack failed. Not only did he fail, but he was unable to get back to the Crusader lines, as the Seljuks blocked off him from the rest of the army and then ambushed him, killing many Germans. This caused Conrad and his Germans to take refuge in a nearby castle while the rest of the crusaders feared that he had abandoned them. The day after Conrad&#x27;s failed attack, nothing eventful happened. The Seljuk continued to surround the Crusaders and shower arrows on them, adding to their pressure and anxiety. The next day, Anselm&#x27;s Italian crusaders attempted to break through the Seljuk lines from the east, but even though they killed many Turks, they lost many Crusaders too, forcing them to withdraw. On the fifth day of the battle, Kilij Arslan was joined by some Danishmendid princes and the Turcoman emir of Aleppo, Fakhr al-Mulk Ridwan. Along with them came many Aleppan Turks and Danishmendids. After joining Kilij Arslan, the Turks launched an attack, annhilating the Lombards and making the Pechenegs retreat from the Crusader lines. At this point of the battle the Turks were attacking the Crusaders from all sides, and the French and German crusaders were forced to fall back. Raymond was trapped on a rock and was rescued by Stephen and Conrad. The battle continued into the next day, when the crusader camp was captured and the knights fled, leaving women, children, and priests behind to be killed or enslaved. Raymond, Stephen of Blois, and Stephen of Burgundy fled north to Sinope, and returned to Constantinople by ship. The Crusaders who did not possess many horses, mostly the Lombards, were not able to retreat that far from the Turks, and were hunted like wild game by them. After the battle, most of the old men and women and children were all killed. Those camp followers and warriors who did not die, but got captured, were sent into slavery. Anselm IV and Eudes I, Duke of Burgundy both died in battle. Also, the Holy Lance found by Peter Bartholomew during the Siege of Antioch was captured by Kilij Arslan. News of Anselm&#x27;s death did not reach Milan until 1102. He was succeeded by his vicar, Grosolanus. After the Battle of Mersivan, the Franco-German-Lombard Crusader expedition of Raymond of Toulouse, Anselm of Milan, and Stephen of Blois was almost completely destroyed. Those who managed to escape, were mainly the knights and nobles who had horses.

One of the Crusaders who managed to escape the calamity was Raymond IV of Toulouse. He, with a small escort, managed to reach the small Byzantine-Paphlagonian port of Bafra, a city at the mouth of the Halys River, and from where they managed to get on a small ship to Constantinople. Other knights who managed to escape went to Sinope and from there they sailed to Constantinople. Much of the Crusaders blamed the failure of the Crusade on Alexios and the Byzantines. In reality, Alexios was furious at the Crusade&#x27;s failure. Although he received with Raymond and his companions with courtesy, he was very cold and did not hide his disappointment at all.

==Battles of Heraclea==

Just as the Franco-Lombard contingent had left Nicomedia, a separate force under Count William II of Nevers arrived at Constantinople. The force consisted of soldiers from the County of Nevers or Niverais. The Niverais under William II had crossed into Byzantine-Epirote city of Valona over the Adriatic Sea from Bari. From Valona, the march of the Niverais to Constantinople was free of incident, an unusual occurrence for a crusader army. After being received cordially by the Eastern Roman Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, he soon reached Nicomedia. In Nicomedia, William II of Nevers soon learned where he was soon going to be joined by another crusader army that mainly consisted of French and Bavarians. Not only that, he found out that the Franco-Lombard army was heading towards Ancyra. Either by a desire not to share his crusading glory with the oncoming Franco-Bavarian army or by a desire to join the Franco-Lombard army, with included his relative Count Stephen I the Rash of Burgundy, William made his decision. William left Nicomedia with his Niverais crusaders before the rest Franco-Bavarian army could assemble and headed for Ancyra. On his march, William came very close to joining Anselm IV&#x27;s army but in fact never caught up with them. After reaching Ancyra, William went south, besieging Iconium in mid-August while the sultan of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, Kilij Arslan I, was distracted fighting the Franco-Lombards at the Battle of Mersivan. But after besieging it for three days, William could not take it and he continued on his march. William II of Nevers now set off for the Byzantine controlled city of Heraclea Cybistra. But by the time William set off, Kilij Arslan was finished defeated the Lombards at the Battle of Mersivan and now set off to destroy William&#x27;s army. To do this, Kilij Arslan had his Seljuks positioned and hidden on both sides of the road William was taking towards Heraclea Cybistra. As William approached Heraclea he was soon ambushed at Heraclea Cybistra by Kilij Arslan. After a bit of resistance, the tired and weakened crusader army succumbed to the Turcoman attack and at Heraclea almost the Niverais was almost completely wiped out, except for the count himself and a few dozen of his men. The women in his entourage, at least a thousand in number, were taken prisoner and then enslaved. After spending a few days crossing the Taurus Mountains, the Niverais crusaders managed to reach the Byzantine forts of Germanicopolis and Seleucia Isauria, forts which were in the Anatolian region of Cilicia. According to the only source of the Niverais expedition, Albert of Aachen, the local Byzantine governor offered to provide the William and his companions with an escort of twelve Pecheneg mercenaries to accompany them to the Levant. But few weeks later, Count William II of Nevers and his companions reached the Antioch under Tancred of Galilee half-naked and unarmed, claiming that the treacherous Pechenegs, who were accompanying them on the orders of the Byzantine governor, had robbed them and abandoned them in the Cilician desert they were crossing.
As William and the Niverais were leaving Nicomedia, a new crusading army had arrived, consisting of French and Bavarian crusaders. It was led by William IX of Aquitaine, who was a famous troubadour and was an enemy of Count Raymond IV of Toulouse. The reason he was an enemy of Raymond as his wife, Philippa of Toulouse, was the daughter of Raymond&#x27;s elder brother, William IV of Toulouse and thus had a claim to the throne of County of Toulouse, Narbonne, and the Margrave of Provence. Another crusader leader included Hugh of Vermandois. He had participated in the successful First Crusade and after the Siege of Antioch, he was sent to Constantinople by the crusader leaders to ask Alexios I Komnenos for reinforcements. But after unsuccessfully doing so, he left for France, instead of rejoining the crusader army to attack Jerusalem. But after being scorned by his countrymen for abandoning his fellow crusaders and for breaking his oath to take Jerusalem, the Pope Paschal II threatened to excommunicate him, prompting him to take the cross again for this crusade. The French crusaders were joined by Hugh VI of Lusignan. 

From here the French crusader army of 16,000 went through Southern Germany, Austria, and Hungary they were joined by Duke Welf I of Bavaria, a papal legate who was the Archbishop of Salzburg with the name of Thiemo, and the widowed margravine Ida of Austria, mother of Leopold III of Austria. The crusaders would reach the Eastern Roman Empire by crossing into the Byzantine city of Belgrade, after following the Danube River during their march. From here the crusaders would pillaged Byzantine territory on the way to Constantinople and had almost come into conflict with Pecheneg mercenaries sent by the Byzantines to stop them, until William IX of Aquitaine and Duke Welf I of Bavaria intervened. The logical choice for the Franco-Bavarians was to link up with the Niverais. But just before they could arrive, William and his contingent left to join the Franco-Lombard army. As William and his Niverais were heading for Ancyra, the Franco-Bavarians waited for 5 weeks. During these 5 weeks, the Franco-Bavarians stopped hearing information about the Lombard contingent made them start to fear that Alexios was responsible about that, leading to a mistrust of the Byzantines. False fears of the Anatolia trip induced many pilgrims to sell their horses to pay for a sea voyage, but there were also those who had second thoughts because they were afraid of being intercepted and captured by the Byzantine navy. The gigantic wave of confusion that gripped the Germans is vividly described by the historian Ekkehard of Aura, one of the civilian pilgrims who chose to remain on board the ships bound for Palestine, where he landed with his companions at the end of a six-week journey. After a part of the Franco-Bavarians left for the sea route to Jaffa from Constantinople, the rest of the crusaders decided to take the land route through Anatolia. These Franco-Bavarians, led by Hugh of Vermandois, followed the route that he had used during the First Crusade (the route Raymond wanted to lead Anselm&#x27;s force through). But, as it was summer caused the army to face dehydration and fatigue due to the hot weather. Also, Seljuk Turkish supply raids and skirmishes, and the scorched earth tactics of the Seljuk Turks caused demoralization and supply issues. All this trouble was made by Kilij Arslan as all the harassment had his Seljuks do was all part of his plan. After defeating the Niverais, Kilij Arslan I knew that there was only one last crusader army left, the Franco-Bavarian one. He successfully first tried to weaken the crusader army and now planned another ambush next to a city on the crusader&#x27;s route, Heraclea Cybistra. So as Hugh led the crusader army to Heraclea Cybistra in September, the they saw the dead bodies of William&#x27;s Niverais crusaders and then, like the Niverais, were ambushed and massacred by Kilij Arslan. William and Welf escaped, but Hugh was mortally wounded; the survivors eventually arrived at Tarsus, where Hugh died on 18 October. There even wasn&#x27;t much of a battle to speak of. The crusaders this time were so tired, starving, demoralized, weakened, and thirsty that they couldn&#x27;t even fight back the Turks. The &quot;battle&quot; was an easy Seljuk Turkish victory. Ida of Austria disappeared during this ambush and was presumably killed, but according to later legend she was taken into captivity and became the mother of Zengi, a great enemy of the crusaders in the 1140s, which - however - is impossible due to chronological factors. Meanwhile Welf of Bavaria managed to escape to Cyprus but died in the Cypriot city of Paphos. He is now buried at Weingarten Abbey and was succeeded by his son Welf II. Several traditions concerning Thiemo&#x27;s death exist. He may have been taken captive by the Seljuqs of Rûm after the Battle of Heraclea in Anatolia in September 1101 or was imprisoned by the Fatimid Caliphate at Ascalon in the following year. His martyrdom is described being tortured and killed by pulling the intestines out of his body with a spindle.

==Crusade in the Holy Land==

After the Battle of Mersivan, Raymond managed to escape the battle and return to Constantinople. In 1102, he travelled by sea from Constantinople to Antioch, where he was imprisoned by Tancred, regent of Antioch during the captivity of Bohemond, and was only dismissed after promising not to attempt any conquests in the country between Antioch and Acre. He immediately broke his promise, and besieged Tortosa. During the siege, he was joined by another leader of the Crusade of 1101, William of Nevers. William was able to escape the Battle of Heraclea also escaped to Tarsus and joined the rest of the survivors of the Crusade of 1101. Under Raymond, William and the survivors of the Crusade captured Tortosa from the Turks, with help from a Genoese fleet. After taking Tortosa, Raymond put the major city of Tripoli under siege. He was aided by Alexios I, who preferred a friendly state in Tripoli to balance the hostile state in Antioch. Alexios had ten Eastern Roman ships join a Genoese fleet to blockade Tripoli&#x27;s harbor. Then, Raymond, with the aid of Byzantine engineers started to build a fort called Mons Peregrinus, &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s mountain&quot; or &quot;Qalaat Saint-Gilles&quot; (&quot;fortress of Saint-Gilles&quot;), in order to block Tripoli&#x27;s access inland. Then, with the Genoese Hugh Embriaco, Raymond also seized Gibelet. As Gibelet or Giblet, it came under the rule of the Genoese Embriaco family, who created for themselves the Lordship of Gibelet, first as administrators of the city in the name of the Republic of Genoa, and then as a hereditary fief, undertaking to pay an annual fee to Genoa and the church of San Lorenzo, the cathedral at Genoa. After taking Gibelet, Raymond and his newly founded County of Tripoli controlled all the Levantine lands between Antioch and Kingdom of Jerusalem except for Tripoli itself. The Siege of Tripoli would continue until 1109.

To maintain Pisa&#x27;s influence in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Dagobert of Pisa needed to control the church, but he was always short of money, and pious symphasisers gave their donations to the church. Complaints had been made about the legality of Dagobert&#x27;s appointment. A new papal legate, Maurice of Porto, then came to Jerusalem in early March 1101. As Baldwin accused Dagobert of treachery and for urging Bohemond to oppose Baldwin&#x27;s succession, he was able to convince Maurice to suspend him on 15April, Dagobert had to bribe Baldwin with 300 bezants to persuade the legate to restore him to his office.

The towns along the coast which were still under Egyptian rule—Arsuf, Caesarea, Acre and Tyre—sent gifts to Baldwin to secure his benevolence.
Always in need of funds, Baldwin concluded an alliance with the commanders of a Genoese fleet, offering commercial privileges and booty to them in the towns that he would capture with their support. They first attacked Arsuf, which surrendered without resistance on 29 April, securing a safe passage for the townspeople to Ascalon. The Egyptian garrison at Caesarea resisted, but the town fell on 17May. Baldwin&#x27;s soldiers pillaged Caesarea and massacred the majority of the adult local population. The Genoese received one third of the booty, but Baldwin did not grant areas in the captured towns to them. The Genoese fleet weakened Dagobert&#x27;s position, as Baldwin no longer depended for sea power on the Pisan fleet.

While Baldwin and the Genoese were besieging Caesarea, the Fatimid vizier, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, started mustering troops at Ascalon. Baldwin moved his headquarters to nearby Jaffa and fortified Ramla to hinder any attempt at a surprise attack against Jerusalem. Roger Borsa, Duke of Apulia, in Baldwin&#x27;s orders, sent money to Dagobert, partially for the recruitment of soldiers and demanded money for the costs of the defence of Ramla. Dagobert, though, retained the whole sum and he also refused to pay for the costs of the Ramlan defences. During a passionate debate in the presence of the papal legate, Dagobert stated that Baldwin should not &quot;presume to make tributary and servant the holy Church&quot;. Maurice persuaded Dagobert to promise that he would &quot;maintain thirty soldiers by a money agreement&quot;, but the patriarch failed to raise the promised amount.

The Fatimids were led by Saad el-Dawleh, former governor of Beirut, while the Crusaders were under the command of King Baldwin I. Baldwin had only 260 cavalry and 900 foot soldiers under his command, leaving him severely outnumbered by the Fatimid army, which was estimated at 32,000 men by Fulcher of Chartres, and downgraded to 3,000–5,000 by modern historians. The lightly armed and undisciplined Fatimid army approached Ramla in early September. Upon sighting the Fatimid army in the First Battle of Ramla, Baldwin arrayed his force in six divisions, commanding the reserve force himself. The much smaller, but experienced and well-equipped crusader forces were the first to attack, at dawn on 7September. But in Baldwin&#x27;s audacious attack the first two Crusader divisions were wiped out while the vanguard took heavy casualties too, with one of Baldwin&#x27;s allies, Geldemar Carpinel among the slain. The battle seemed to be lost, but when the third division was pursued after being routed by the Fatimids, Baldwin ordered a counter-attack and committed his reserve. In vicious close-quarter combat, the Crusaders repulsed the Fatimid forces, who in panic they all buckled under the force of Baldwin&#x27;s counterattack and started to retreat. After pursuing the fleeing Fatimids to Ascalon, Baldwin returned to Ramla to plunder the Fatimid camp. This success secured the Kingdom of Jerusalem against the Fatimid Caliphate&#x27;s advances for the campaigning season. According to Fulcher of Chartres, who was present at the battle, the Fatimids lost around 5,000 men in the battle, including their general Saad al-Daulah. However, Crusader losses were heavy too, losing 80 knights and a large amount of infantry.

The battle had so nearly been a defeat for the Crusaders, and while the Fatimid survivors fled to Ascalon the remnants of the vanguard that was crushed earlier in the battle themselves fled to Jaffa. So great was the confusion after the battle that around 500 Fatimid troops advanced to the walls of Jaffa, where survivors of the Latin vanguard informed Baldwin&#x27;s wife Arda that the king and all his men were dead. A letter was immediately sent north to Antioch to ask Tancred, regent of Antioch in the place of Bohemond of Taranto, for assistance. Jaffa did not immediately capitulate, and when Baldwin returned victorious the following day the remaining Egyptian forces quickly scattered. Ascalon remained in Fatimid hands, however, and a miscalculation would prove very costly to Baldwin when the two sides once again met at Ramla the following year.

Roger Borsa, Duke of Apulia, sent money to Dagobert, partially for the recruitment of soldiers, but Dagobert retained the whole sum. After learning of this embezzlement, Baldwin convinced the papal legate to dismiss Dagobert in late 1101. Dagobert fled first to Jaffa, then to Tancred in Antioch. Tancred, who now ruled Antioch, welcomed Dagobert to the city, where he put the Church of St George at his disposal. The vacancy enabled Baldwin to freely use the patriarch&#x27;s rich treasury.

By now the Crusade of 1101 was more of a pilgrimage. The survivors arrived at Antioch at the end of 1101, and at Easter in 1102 arrived in Jerusalem. Stephen of Blois, Hugh of Lusignan, William IX of Aquitaine, Stephen of Burgundy and other survivors were able to celebrate Easter in Jerusalem in 1102. Soon enough, they were all regrouping at Jaffa to depart home under the presence of King Baldwin. Duke William IX of Aquitaine had already left with some of the survivors. The reason they had left was because their vow having been fulfilled. But men like Stephen of Blois, Hugh of Lusignan and Stephen of Burgundy had been forced back due to unfavorable winds.

As they were doing this, news of a new Fatimid invasion force arrived, led by Sharaf al-Ma&#x27;ali Sama&#x27; al-Mulk al-Husayn ibn al-Afdal, who was Fatimid vizier al-Afdal&#x27;s son. But Baldwin&#x27;s faulty scouts had led him to believe he was facing a small Fatimid force, so he rode out with 200 knights, including the surviving leaders of the Crusade of 1101. But he soon realized his mistake too late. He found himself facing not a few hundred, but 20,000 Fatimid soldiers, an army which was 100 times bigger than his. They were attacked by the Fatimids, and many died. Baldwin and the rest of his army managed to retreat to Ramla and managed to barricade themselves in Ramla&#x27;s single tower. Baldwin was left with no other option than to flee and escaped the tower under the cover of night with just his scribe and a single knight, Hugh of Brulis, who is never mentioned in any source afterwards. Baldwin had left the rest to their fate. The situation of the remaining knights in Ramla deteriorated when Fatimid forces stormed the town in the morning after Baldwin&#x27;s escape, with only the tower remaining under Crusader control. The Fatimids ruthlessly attacked the tower, undermining walls and setting fires to smoke out the desperate defenders. After a day of desperately holding their ground, the Crusaders, all but abandoned by their king, said a prayer and charged out against the Fatimids. Almost all of the meagre force was immediately slain including Stephen of Blois, who finally recovered the honour that he had lost when he deserted the Siege of Antioch four years previously. However, Conrad of Germany, the constable of Henry IV who had previously led a contingent at the Crusade of 1101, fought so valiantly that even after everyone around him was dead he still fought on, holding off the Fatimids to the point that his awestruck foe offered to spare his life if he surrendered. But there were no survivors. Other than Stephen of Blois and Conrad of Germany, Stephen of Burgundy, and Hugh VI of Lusignan all died. Odo Arpin of Bourges got captured but was soon released by Alexios I Komnenos. After the Second Battle of Ramla, the Fatimid army blockaded and besieged the city of Jaffa where Arda and the civilian survivors of the Crusade of 1101 were. There the Fatimids got a random European corpse, mutiliated it, and paraded it in front of the city&#x27;s walls. The city defenders got tricked that Baldwin had died which demoralized them. But just as they were about to surrender Baldwin had arrived.

Baldwin spent the next two days evading Fatimid search parties until he arrived exhausted, starved, and parched in the reasonably safe haven of Arsuf on May 19. He fled to Arsuf, after which an English pirate, Godric, took him to Jaffa, although the Egyptian army had blockaded it from the land. Meanwhile, a force of eighty knights under Hugh of Falchenburg managed to break in by land. With Baldwin&#x27;s forces strengthened by the arrival of a fleet of French and German Crusaders, he was able to assemble an army of eight thousand men and surprised the unprepared Egyptians. Discontent was already arising from Sharaf&#x27;s indecisive leadership and the Fatimids quickly retreated back to Ascalon.

During the siege of Jaffa, Baldwin had sent envoys to Antioch and Edessa, seeking assistance from Tancred and Baldwin II. They arrived only after the Egyptians&#x27; withdrawal. Tancred tried to persuade the new papal legate, Robert of St Eusebio, to restore Dagobert, but Baldwin convinced Robert to discuss the issue with the local bishops and abbots. After the prelates unanimously stated that Dagobert had almost provoked a civil war and had abused his ecclesiastical authority, the legate allowed them to elect a pious priest, Evremar, as patriarch.

==Aftermath==
The Second Battle of Ramla led to the end of many crusaders who had taken the cross for the Crusade of 1101. Stephen, Count of Blois, father of Stephen, the future King of England, was killed during this battle, as was Hugh VI of Lusignan, ancestor of the future Lusignan dynasty of Jerusalem and Cyprus. Joscelin of Courtenay also stayed behind, and survived to become Count of Edessa in 1118.

The defeat of the crusaders allowed Kilij Arslan to establish his capital at Iconium, and also proved to the Muslim world that the crusaders were not invincible, as they appeared to be during the First Crusade. The crusaders and Byzantines each blamed the other for the defeat, and neither of them were able to ensure a safe route through Anatolia now that Kilij Arslan had strengthened his position. The only open route to the Holy Land was the sea route, which benefitted the Italian maritime republics. The lack of a safe land route from Constantinople also benefitted the Principality of Antioch, where Tancred, ruling for his uncle Bohemond, was able to consolidate his power without Byzantine interference.

Both the Second and Third Crusades suffered similar difficulties when attempting to cross Anatolia.

<text>Magyar Telekom [[List of legal entity types by country#Hungary|Nyrt.]] (officially &quot;Magyar Telekom Távközlési Nyilvánosan Működő Részvénytársaság, Magyar Telekom Telecommunications Public Limited Company&quot; ) is one of the leading Hungarian telecommunications service provider company. It is a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.

Magyar Telekom provides a full range of telecommunications and information communication (ICT) services to private individuals as well as small, medium and large corporate customers, including landline and mobile phone, data transfer and non-voice based, as well as IT and system integration services uniformly under the Telekom brand. Magyar Telekom is connected to the lives of its customers by millions of threads, telephone, internet, TV and IT: it has a high-quality, reliable and uniquely wide range of services in all areas. Magyar Telekom Nyrt. is the 100% owner of Telekom Regszerintegració Zrt., as well as the majority owner of Makedonski Telekom, the leading integrated service provider in North Macedonia.
Until 6 May 2005, it was known as Matáv (&quot;Magyar Távközlési Rt.&quot; – Hungarian Telecommunications PLC). The company was formed under the name of &quot;Magyar Távközlési Vállalat&quot; (Hungarian Telecommunications Enterprise) in December 1989, when &quot;Magyar Posta&quot; (Hungarian Post) was split into three separate enterprises. On 31 December 1991, the company was re-structured as a public limited company as &quot;Magyar Távközlési Rt..&quot; On 1 July 1993, the Telecommunications Act came into effect, making it possible to privatize the company. The company remained 100% state owned until the end of 1993. At this point, a consortium was formed between Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech, which was named MagyarCom. MagyarCom bought a company share of 30.1% for a price of US$875 million.

==History==

=== Early years ===
On 31 December 1989, after becoming one of the three sections of the Hungarian Post service area, the Hungarian Telecommunications Company (Matáv) was founded, as telecommunications operator Magyar Telecom Rt. The company was wholly owned by the state until the end of 1993, but became privatized after the Telecommunications Act came into effect 1 July 1993. In 1993, 30.1% ownership of Matáv was purchased by Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech International telecommunications companies, under the new name, MagyarCom Consortium. During the privatization process MagyarCom acquired a majority stake of the company, under a contract signed on 22 December 1995. The effect of the two companies forming a consortium was Central and Eastern Europe&#x27;s largest privatization, and also the largest foreign investment in Hungary.

=== Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s majority ===
On 14 November 1997, Matáv share trading began in Budapest and New York City, placing 26.31% of the shares on the market, which was the largest share subscription ever held in Hungary, making Matáv the first Central European company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In the summer of 1999, ÁPV Rt. (Hungary&#x27;s State Privatization Property Agency) sold the last package of shares of Hungary&#x27;s 5.75%, but still held the golden share.

On 3 July 2000, Deutsche Telekom acquired SBC&#x27;s 50% stake in MagyarCom in compliance of their shareholder agreement. As a result of the change in the ownership structure of MagyarCom, Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s ownership in Matáv increased to 59.52%, the remaining 40.48% public shareholding, while the golden share was owned by Hungary.

=== Internationalization ===
Since 2001, it was possible for Matáv to become an international telecommunications group. The consortium led by Matáv acquired a majority stake in Macedonia&#x27;s national telecommunications company Makedonski Telekomunikacii (MakTel), which became a consolidated subsidiary of the group. As a further step, Matáv acquired the remaining 50% stake in Emitel Rt.

The group&#x27;s companies took leading positions in the mobile phone, internet and business data communications markets, with a share of over 80% in the fixed phone market.

A new governance structure of the group was adopted at the end of 2001.

=== Rebranding ===
In 2002, the Matáv Group obtained group-level certification in accordance with ISO 9001:2000, certified by SGS S.A.

Matáv also wanted to lead telecommunications and Internet services in Hungary, as evidenced by the 100,000th ADSL subscription acquired in December 2003. In mobile telephones, number portability was a minor difficulty, but the Westel division of the group solved the problem in 2004.

In March 2004, the group decided to replace the Westel name, which had existed since 1989, and joined the global T-Mobile brand on 1 May 2004. Subsequently, the Matáv Group decided to consolidate and merge, subordinating the structure of the group of companies on 1 January 2005, and then on 6 May all its services and operational organizations under central management and the group of companies.

<doc id="574164" wikidata="Q168556" url="?curid=574164" title="Schmalkaldic War">
<text>The Schmalkaldic War (; July 1546May 1547) was fought within the territories of the Holy Roman Empire between the allied forces of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Maurice, Duke of Saxony against the Lutheran Schmalkaldic League, with the forces directly loyal to Charles fighting under the command of Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba.

==Background==

In the course of the Lutheran Reformation numerous Imperial States had adopted the new confession, against the opposition of the ruling Catholic House of Habsburg, who recognised these conversions as a quest for increasing autonomy to the detriment of the central Imperial authority.

At the 1521 Diet of Worms Emperor Charles V had Martin Luther subjected to an Imperial ban and the dissemination of his writings prohibited. The edicts of the Diet condemned Luther and officially banned citizens of the Holy Roman Empire from defending or propagating his ideas, subjecting advocates of Lutheranism to forfeiture of all property, half of the seized property to be forfeit to the imperial government and the remaining half forfeit to the party who brought the accusation. While it was understood that Luther was to be eventually arrested and punished, enforcement of this was suspended on account of the strength of his current popular appeal. After the Diets of Nuremberg failed to accomplish the goal of arresting Luther, the Diet of Speyer (1526) reversed course and temporarily suspended the Edict of Worms. This diet was condemned at the Diet of Speyer (1529), provoking the Protestation at Speyer and giving rise to the term &quot;Protestant.&quot; This led to the presentation of the Lutheran &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot; and Catholic &quot;Confutatio Augustana&quot; at the 1530 Diet of Augsburg. In response to the &quot;Confutatio&quot;, Philipp Melanchthon prepared the &quot;Prima delineatio&quot;. Although this was rejected by the Emperor, Melanchthon improved it as a private document until it was signed at a meeting of the Schmalkaldic League as the 1537 &quot;Apology of the Augsburg Confession&quot;, but the Catholic side did not respond to it until the 1545–63 Council of Trent.

In turn several Lutheran states led by Elector John Frederick I of Saxony and Landgrave Philip I of Hesse met at the town of Schmalkalden, where they established the Schmalkaldic League in 1531. At first, the Nuremberg Religious Peace of 1532 granted religious liberty to members of the Schmalkaldic League. But, in 1544 Charles V returned to Germany from the Italian War after he had signed the Treaty of Crépy and began to forge alliances not only with Pope Paul III but also with Lutheran princes, foremost with Duke Maurice of Saxony, the Albertine cousin of Saxon Elector John Frederick I. In view of the Emperor&#x27;s preparations for battle, the Schmalkaldic leaders on 4 July 1546 gathered at Ichtershausen. Here they negotiated how the league should deal with the approaching conflict with the emperor. Both John Frederick and Philip of Hesse agreed quickly that the Emperor had larger financial resources and thus could set up a larger army. However, they also noticed that they were positioned to mobilize their troops faster than the emperor because Charles V had not yet concentrated a significant amount of mercenaries. As a result, they decided to wage a preventive war. Since Martin Luther had died in February, this eliminated a major obstacle to their decision. Luther had repeatedly argued against the legality and morality of a war between the Empire and the Schmalkaldic League. To Luther, only a beerwolf type ruler could be legitimately resisted by his own subjects.

The Emperor gathered an army of around 52,000 men (20,000 Germans, 12,000 Italians, 10,000 Spaniards, and 10,000 men from the Netherlands) for his campaign, that was to start on the Danube.

==Conflict==
The war broke out in Swabia when a united army of several Lutheran Imperial cities occupied the Catholic town of Füssen, a possession of the Augsburg prince-bishops, and made the Imperial forces move toward the fortress of Ingolstadt in the Bavarian duchy. However, plans to invade Austrian Tyrol in order to bar the Emperor from bringing up Italian troops did not meet the approval of the Schmalkaldic princes. Both Duke William IV of Bavaria and the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand I of Habsburg declared themselves neutral in the conflict, allowing Charles V to concentrate a mighty Imperial army without disturbances.

Furthermore, the Schmalkaldic leaders could not resolve upon delivering a battle against the entrenched Imperial troops. On 20 July 1546 Elector John Frederick I and Landgrave Philip I were placed under the Imperial ban, under the pretext that they had deposed the Catholic Duke Henry V of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1542. Duke Maurice of Saxony took the chance and in October with the aid of Ferdinand I of Habsburg, King of Bohemia, invaded the lands of his rival and cousin in Ernestine Saxony, forcing Elector John Frederick I to turn his troops around. He quickly came on from Swabia and liberated Ernestine Saxony with his army, whereafter he in turn invaded Albertine Saxony and the adjacent Bohemian lands. The onset of winter left the armed conflict inconclusive.

In Swabia the Hessian troops took no further action, while the forsaken Imperial cities like the Lutheran princes Duke Ulrich of Württemberg and Count Palatine Frederick II chose to submit to the Emperor. On 28 March 1547 Charles V set off for Bohemia, where he united forces with his brother King Ferdinand I of Bohemia. Because the Bohemian Lutherans did not provide any military assistance to Elector John Frederick I, as he had hoped for, the Spanish-Imperial forces of Charles V forced him into retreat. Due to disagreement in strategy, the League&#x27;s defenses were finally routed on 24 April 1547 at the Battle of Mühlberg, where John Frederick I was taken prisoner.

After the battle, which determined the result of the war, only two cities continued to resist: Bremen and Magdeburg. Both cities refused to pay the fines Charles imposed on them and avoided occupation by Imperial troops. In the case of Bremen, 12,000 imperial soldiers under the command of Duke Eric II of Brunswick-Calenberg unsuccessfully laid siege from January until May. This event led to the Battle of Drakenburg on 23 May 1547, as a Protestant army of the Schmalkaldic League was plundering the nearby Principality of Calenberg. His men and supplies exhausted, Duke Eric II and his Imperial forces went to confront the army and were quickly defeated. During the fighting, Eric was forced to swim over the Weser river in order to save his own life. As a consequence of the Battle of Drakenburg, the Imperial troops left northern Germany.

==Aftermath==
The captured Elector John Frederick I at first was sentenced to death, and, in order to obtain pardon, on 19 May 1547 signed the Capitulation of Wittenberg. He lost the electoral dignity and some minor Ernestine territories to his cousin Maurice, who was declared the new Saxon Elector on 4 June. Maurice with the aid of Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg tried to mediate in favour of his father-in-law Philip I of Hesse. The Landgrave delivered himself up in Halle, where he threw himself on the mercy of the Emperor. Charles V nevertheless had him immediately imprisoned, leaving the Electors disturbed by this show of haughtiness.

Although the Imperial forces were victorious over the Schmalkaldic League, crushing them, the ideas of Luther had by this time so overspread Europe they could not be contained by military force. However, on 15 May 1548 Charles V, feeling at the height of his power, dictated the Augsburg Interim to prepare the reintegration of the Protestants into the Catholic Church. The edict provoked another revolt by the Protestant princes in 1552, known as the Second Schmalkaldic War. This time the Protestant princes were led by Elector Maurice of Saxony and backed by King Henry II of France. Charles V had to flee from the superior Lutheran forces and to cancel the Interim with the Peace of Passau, whereby John Frederick I of Saxony and Philip I of Hesse were released. An official settlement acknowledging the Protestant religion arrived three years later in the form of the Peace of Augsburg. The next year Charles V voluntarily abdicated in favour of his brother Ferdinand I.

<text>Eternal Darkness: Sanity&#x27;s Requiem is a 2002 action-adventure video game developed by Silicon Knights and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It was produced and directed by Denis Dyack. The game follows the story of several characters across a period of two millennia and four different locations on Earth, as they contend with an ancient evil who seeks to enslave humanity. The gameplay distinguishes itself with unique &quot;sanity effects&quot;, visual and audial effects that confuse the player and often break the fourth wall.

Development on &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; began after Nintendo, impressed with Silicon Knights&#x27; &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot; (1996), contacted the company to propose a collaboration on an original mature title. Silicon Knights based their concept around Lovecraftian horror and the Eternal Champion concept, and decidedly avoided making a survival horror game. It was originally planned for the Nintendo 64, and was mostly completed before development was moved to Nintendo&#x27;s forthcoming home console, the GameCube. It was the first game published by Nintendo to receive an M (Mature) rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB).

While &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; was widely acclaimed by critics and won numerous awards, the game was a commercial failure, selling less than 500,000 copies worldwide. A direct sequel to the game was explored but never materialized, and Silicon Knights went bankrupt and disbanded in 2013. Attempts by Dyack to make a spiritual successor entitled &quot;Shadow of the Eternals&quot; with his new studio Precursor Games failed both of their Kickstarter campaigns, leading to the project being placed on indefinite hold. In the years since &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot;″ release, it has been regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time, as well as one of the best horror games ever made.

==Gameplay==
The game is conducted from a third-person perspective. It has an in-game map which tracks the player&#x27;s bearings. The inventory system stores weapons and items that can be used to solve puzzles, some of which can be combined with other objects, even enchanted with magick, for different effects.

Combat focuses on a simple targeting system. Players may attack in a general direction, or lock-on to an enemy to focus on individual parts of its anatomy. Decapitating most enemies effectively blinds them. There are many classes of enemies the player must either defeat or avoid. Each class also comes in a few varieties, and subtle differences between each variety exist as well, having slightly different appearances and traits. Some of the more common enemies vary very little in appearance, usually only changing in hue and aesthetics, but may have some behavioral differences. Boss and mini-boss enemies, however, tend to vary quite significantly.

The narrative of the game&#x27;s story switches between two phases. The main phase focuses on a series of chapters in which players take control of a new character each time. The other phase acts as an intermission, exploring the mansion in order to find chapter pages and other items in order to progress. The game boasts twelve playable characters, split between four distinct locations, and from different periods of time, at times in anachronic order. Each of these characters are different in terms of the game&#x27;s three main parametershealth, sanity, and magickand have access to a small selection of weapons that they can use in combat, though what they can use is determined by the time period that they lived in. For example, characters from the more ancient eras are restricted to mostly melee weapons such as swords, with the occasional crossbow or throwable. Meanwhile, characters from the colonial era onwards have more access to ranged weapons, including modern-day firearms.

The story features multiple paths that can be taken at the end of the first chapter. This choice not only determines which of the game&#x27;s other three antagonists are aligned to the plot, but it also has subtle effects on the gameplay in chapters and intermission periods. Some changes include slight differences in puzzles and items, but most changes revolve around enemy placement, which will determine how the player engages them. This can even have an effect on the relative difficulty of the game in certain situations. Red tinted enemies for example, are generally tougher, having more health and dealing more damage, making that story path a kind of unofficial hard mode. After the game is completed down one path, it becomes unavailable in future playthroughs, until the player completes all three paths.

Magick can be used by most characters and consists of spells that can be used to damage opponents, protect characters and heal them, and be used to solve certain puzzles. The player is also able to assign spells to buttons for quick-use during the game. After discovering a spell it can be used in subsequent chapters and intermission periods. All spells are fundamentally affected by what alignment rune is used to power them. The game incorporates four types Red, Green, Blue, and Purple. Each alignment affects spells on a specific parameter. On top of that, they operate on a rock-paper-scissors principle of gameplay. All spells require the player to combine a series of Runes together in order to cast them. Runes can be freely experimented with by the player. This robust mechanic of experimentation has been praised by game critics as unique, and something that sets the magick system in this apart from most magic systems of most other game titles.

The other distinctive gameplay aspect comes from &quot;Sanity Effects&quot;, the game&#x27;s standout concept that Nintendo patented. Upon beginning the game&#x27;s second chapter, players must keep watch on a Sanity meter a green bar which decreases when the player is spotted by an enemy. As the bar becomes low, subtle changes to the environment and random unusual events begin to occur, which reflect the character&#x27;s slackening grip on reality.

Minor effects include a variety of things, such as a skewed camera angle, heads of statues following the character, and unsettling noises. Stronger effects include bleeding on walls and ceilings, entering a room that is unrealistic before finding that the character never left the previous room, or the character suddenly dying. Fourth wall breaking effects such as &quot;To Be Continued&quot; promotions for a &quot;sequel&quot;, and simulated errors and anomalies of the TV or GameCube can happen either from low or depleted sanity, or by a scripted event. While the latter does not affect gameplay, they can be misconstrued by the player as being actual technical malfunctions.
==Story==
The story of &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; takes place over four fictional locations which the game moves between. They include the &quot;Forbidden City&quot; underground temple complex in Persia; a Khmer temple in Angkor Thom, Cambodia; Oublié Cathedral in Amiens, France; and the Roivas Family Estate in Rhode Island, which leads to an ancient underground city named Ehn&#x27;gha beneath the mansion. The story moves between these locations, with each chapter occurring during a different time period (between 26 B.C. and 2000 A.D.), and from the perspective of a different character. The chapters in the game are not in chronological order.

===Plot===

In 2000 AD, Alexandra Roivas returns to her family&#x27;s estate in Rhode Island after her grandfather, Edward Roivas, her only living relative, is found brutally murdered. Two weeks later, the local police have gotten nowhere with the investigation. Alex decides to investigate the mansion for clues, and stumbles upon a secret room containing a book bound with human skin called the &quot;Tome of Eternal Darkness&quot;. Deciding to read it, she finds it contains accounts of various people in the past, beginning with the story of Pious Augustus in 26 BC.

Pious, a respected Roman military commander, is sent to Ancient Persia to locate an important relic. Lured away from his men by mysterious voices, Pious ventures into an underground temple complex called the Forbidden City. He comes across three artifacts. Each possesses the essence of powerful godlike beings referred to as &quot;The Ancients&quot;: Chattur&#x27;gha, Xel&#x27;lotath and Ulyaoth. Upon attempting to touch one of the artifacts, Pious finds himself corrupted by its power, resulting in him becoming undead yet gaining a significant amount of power, whereupon he pledges his allegiance to the artifact&#x27;s Ancient and begins working on summoning them into the universe. The remaining two artifacts that Pious did not claim were put out of Pious&#x27; reach. One of the other artifacts represents the Ancient that is stronger than Pious&#x27;, and the other represents the Ancient weaker than Pious&#x27;.

The artifact representing the weaker Ancient remained in the Forbidden City. In 565 AD, a young swordsman named Karim, ventures to the Forbidden City to locate a treasure for a woman that he loves. Upon finding it, he sacrifices himself in order to guard it. Pious returns to Persia in the Middle Ages to construct a Pillar of Flesh at the Forbidden City, as part of his master&#x27;s plans. In 1460 AD Roberto Bianchi, a Venetian architect traveling through the region, is captured by Pious under the guise of a warlord. While under involuntary servitude, he encounters the spirit of Karim, who entrusts him with the artifact in his possession. Roberto attempts to warn Pious of the dangers within but is thrown into the tower, becoming part of its foundation along with many others. Centuries later in 1991 AD, a Canadian firefighter named Michael Edwards works with his team to extinguish several major oil fires in the Middle East, following the end of the Gulf War. After an explosion killed his entire team and trapped him in the Forbidden City, he is approached by Roberto&#x27;s spirit, who gives him the artifact and instructs him to take it to the Roivas Family Estate. Michael then moves to destroy the Forbidden City with a magickally enhanced bomb. A few months later, Michael delivers the artifact to Edward Roivas in secret, telling him that he &quot;won&#x27;t last a night&quot;.

The artifact representing the stronger Ancient is moved, by Pious, to Oublié Cathedral, in Amiens, France, in order to prevent it from being used against him. First, though, Pious orders the assassination of Charlemagne, so his movement cannot impede his plans. In 814 AD, a Frankish messenger named Anthony, who stumbles upon the plot, travels to the then small monastery in order to warn him of the danger to his life. Despite Anthony&#x27;s best efforts, he arrives too late to save him and dies from the spell he was afflicted with. When the location is reconstructed into a Cathedral long afterwards, Pious summons a creature called the Black Guardian, to protect the artifact that could defeat his master. In 1485 AD a Franciscan friar named Paul Luther, visiting the region to view a holy relic at the cathedral, finds himself accused of murdering a fellow friar by the local Inquisition. Attempting to clear his name, he encounters the Black Guardian, which promptly kills him. In 1916 AD, During World War I, Oublié Cathedral is converted into a field hospital. Peter Jacob, a field reporter making accounts about the war, notes that patients have been disappearing of late. Venturing into the catacombs, he encounters the Black Guardian and defeats it, recovering the artifact it was guarding. Decades later, Edward is visited by a now elderly Peter who gives an account of his experience in Amiens before handing over the artifact in his possession.

While the other two artifacts are fought over between Pious and several unwitting souls, the &quot;Corpse God&quot; Mantorok, another powerful Ancient that can oppose Pious&#x27; master, has an artifact of its own. In 1150 AD, Pious travels to a temple in Angkor Thom, Cambodia in order to deal with Mantorok. A young Khmer slave girl, named Ellia, finds herself trapped within the temple at the same time. While trying to find her way out, she is approached by one of Mantorok&#x27;s servants, who entrusts her with the task of protecting the Ancient&#x27;s essence within her body. Pious kills her shortly after. Centuries later in 1983 AD, Dr. Edwin Lindsey, a noted archaeologist, ventures to Cambodia on an expedition to explore the temple. After nearly being killed by Pious, who disguised himself in order to accompany him, Edwin finds Ellia&#x27;s body and is entrusted by her spirit with Mantorok&#x27;s essence, which he eventually delivers to Edward a few weeks later.

Alongside the struggle to claim the powerful artifacts of the Ancients, the Roivas Family Estate in Rhode Island, U.S. holds secrets of its own. In 1760 AD, Dr. Maximillian Roivas, a colonial ancestor of Alex and her grandfather, inherits his father&#x27;s mansion in Rhode Island and decides to investigate its secrets. He soon finds a large cavern beneath the mansion, containing an ancient city within called Ehn&#x27;gha. He returns to the surface to get help, only to be considered delirious, and is sent to an asylum for the rest of his life. In 1952 AD, Dr. Edward Roivas, a clinical psychologist at the time, inherits the Estate. Finding his way underground, Edward discovers the city incorporates magick machinery and uses it to greatly damage the city with a powerful destructive spell. Knowing this is not enough, he decides to research what he can within the Tome for the final battle. After decades, however, Edward is violently murdered by one of Ehn&#x27;gha&#x27;s &quot;Guardians&quot;.

Alex, having learned all she can from the Tome, decides to finish the fight. Recovering the artifacts from within the mansion, she soon ventures into Ehn&#x27;gha and uses them with the city&#x27;s machinery, in order to summon a rival Ancient to fight Pious&#x27; master. Alex then engages Pious in combat, aided by the spirits of those written in the Tome, eventually defeating him and destroying the essence of his master, who is defeated by its rival. Edward&#x27;s spirit then acts quickly to use Ehn&#x27;gha&#x27;s mechanism to send back the summoned Ancient before it can cause any harm to the world.

After completing all three story paths, Edward Roivas narrates a revelation; all three paths are revealed to have occurred simultaneously in separate timelines. One of Mantorok&#x27;s spheres of influence happens to be chaos, and with it, the ability to subtly manipulate time and space. It turned the other three Ancients against one another in mutual annihilation and merged the timestreams into one complete victory. Now only Mantorok remains, slowly dying, and &quot;plotting&quot;.

==Development==
&quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; was developed by Canadian development studio Silicon Knights and published by Japanese game company Nintendo. It was directed and produced by Denis Dyack of Silicon Knights. The project&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the mid-1990s when Nintendo staff saw Silicon Knights&#x27; game &quot;Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain&quot; (1996) at an E3 gaming convention. Nintendo contacted Silicon Knights, as they had been contemplating adding more mature games to their line-up, and the two companies began collaborating to produce &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot;. Silicon Knights&#x27;s concept for the game was to create a horror game that did not fall under the survival horror genre. Dyack claims they went with &quot;a deeper, more classical approach&quot; to horror, calling it a &quot;psychological thriller&quot; as opposed to the &quot;B-movie horror plots&quot; of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series. They also wanted to make a game in response to contemporary video game controversies. Dyack explains: &quot;Video games were under fire for messing with people&#x27;s heads, and being accused of being murder simulators and stuff. So, we thought, wouldn&#x27;t it be a good idea to make something that really does mess with people&#x27;s heads?&quot;

The development team borrowed inspiration from Edgar Allan Poe, Lovecraftian horror, and the Eternal Champion character concept by Michael Moorcock. Dyack, a history buff, also took examples of evil acts done throughout history to help create a believable world. The idea for the sanity system came from the tabletop role-playing game &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;. The concept was planned from the start, but the sanity effects were challenging to implement, and be approved by Nintendo. Dyack believed that Nintendo was worried players may interpret the sanity effects as an indication of faulty hardware, or may inadvertently cause damage to the hardware as a result of the effects. For example, a player prompted with a message saying their memory card was being formatted may hastily take out the memory card from the system, causing actual damage to it. Nintendo patented the sanity system in 2005.

The game was originally in development for the Nintendo 64 (N64). The team used 3D Studio Max for modelling and Photoshop for textures. It would have required a large capacity N64 Game Pak, including full voice recordings for cinematic sequences, and a surround sound option. It would have supported (but not required) the N64 Expansion Pak accessory for additional memory. By 2000, much of development had been completed, and it was presented and playable at industry trade shows. However, support for the Nintendo 64 was declining in anticipation for Nintendo&#x27;s upcoming new home console, the GameCube. With several months remaining to finish the game, Nintendo decided to move development over to the GameCube. According to lead designer Ted Traver, Nintendo wanted more games in its GameCube lineup, and the cost of manufacturing cartridges was much higher than optical discs. For the transition of development to GameCube, the rendering engine, development tools, sound, and art assets all needed to be redone. While the work was difficult, the new hardware granted the team greater polygon rendering capacity, and more memory for textures. It was originally planned to be a launch title, but development was delayed.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/112&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As development was concluding, Nintendo sent game designers to Silicon Knights to help improve the gameplay. When the September 11 attacks occurred, Silicon Knights opted to remove the character Joseph De Molay, a Templar knight, from the game. The Templar knights were known for taking part in the Crusades, retaking formerly Christian lands in the Middle East. In the interest of not appearing offensive, Joseph was replaced with an oil well firefighter, and all Arab writing in texture images was removed. The Middle Eastern environments were retained.

==Release==
&quot;Eternal Darkness: Sanity&#x27;s Requiem&quot; was first released and published by Nintendo on June 24, 2002 in North America, October 25 in Japan, November 1 in Europe, and November 7 in Australia. It was the first Nintendo-published game to receive an M (Mature) rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), the video game ratings board in North America. All of their previously published games had lighter content ratings.

===Short films===
In 2002, Nintendo and Hypnotic, a film entertainment company, established a filmmaking contest in which contestants submitted ideas that would be later funded into short films if selected. Hypnotic also purchased the rights to produce a film or TV series based on the IP.

The contest drew over 500 submissions. Ten finalists were selected and were granted $2,000 each to produce their respective short films. The grand prize for the contest was $20,000, and was selected by a panel of industry experts. The finalists were unveiled between May 23 and July 4, 2002.

The grand prize winner of the contest was Patrick Daughters, for the film &quot;Unloved&quot;. The viewer&#x27;s choice award went to the film &quot;Cutting Room Floor&quot; by Tyler Spangler and Michael Cioni.

==Reception==
===Reviews and sales===

&quot;Eternal Darkness: Sanity&#x27;s Requiem&quot; received critical acclaim upon its release, with aggregated review scores of over 9/10 at both GameRankings and Metacritic. Upon review, &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; one of its Editor&#x27;s Choice Awards and, in its review of the game, stated: &quot;Simply put, an amazing achievement that shouldn&#x27;t be overlooked. Games do not come any better than this&quot;.

&quot;AllGame&quot; editor Scott Alan Marriott described Eternal Darkness as &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;certainly worth playing&quot;. Mild criticism was noted for its &quot;linear gameplay&quot; and &quot;low difficulty&quot;.

&quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; sold less than 500,000 copies worldwide. In Japan, the game has sold 17,748 copies as of December 31, 2006. In Canada, the game sold 20,000 copies.

===Awards===
&quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; was awarded with &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development&quot; during the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards; it also received nominations for &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Console Gaming&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best video game of June 2002. At GameSpot&#x27;s Best and Worst of 2002, it was awarded &quot;Best Sound on GameCube&quot;, &quot;Best Story on GameCube&quot;, and &quot;Best Graphics (Artistic) on GameCube&quot;; the game was also nominated for &quot;Best Music on GameCube&quot;, &quot;Best Action Adventure Game on GameCube&quot;, and &quot;Game of the Year on GameCube&quot;. GameSpy&#x27;s Game of the Year Awards gave it their honorary &quot;Day of the Tentacle (Cthulhu) Award&quot;.

===Retrospective===
In 2006, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; as the 101st top game on Nintendo systems, while the readers of &quot;IGN&quot; had it voted as the 96th best video game of all time on all systems; in 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; had it listed as the 48th best Nintendo game. The game was ranked as the seventh best game for the GameCube by &quot;X-Play&quot; in 2006, as the fifth best GameCube game by &quot;IGN&quot; in 2007, as the tenth best GameCube game by ScrewAttack that same year, and placed fourth on the list of top GameCube games in the January 2009 issue of &quot;Game Informer&quot;.

Both &quot;X-Play&quot; and &quot;Game Informer&quot; in 2007 in 2006 ranked it as the fifth scariest game of all time. In other lists, ScrewAttack ranked the fake &quot;Corrupt Data&quot; sanity effect as the ninth top &quot;OMGWTF&quot; moment in gaming in 2008, while Alex Roivas was included among the 50 greatest heroines in video games by Tom&#x27;s Games in 2007 and ranked as the 40th greatest heroine in video game history by &quot;Complex&quot; in 2013.

Several retrospective articles demanded a follow-up game. &quot;IGN&quot; included &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; on their 2008 list of &quot;horror franchises that should rise from the grave&quot;, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; included &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; among the games &quot;with untapped franchise potential&quot; in 2009, and UGO included it on a similar list of games &quot;that need sequels&quot; in 2010.

==Legacy==
Alex Roivas makes a cameo appearance in the 2018 fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as one of the many &quot;Spirits&quot; that players can collect. The battle associated with Alex&#x27;s Spirit sees the player needing to defeat Zero Suit Samus from the &quot;Metroid&quot; series as the screen is mirrored at random intervals.

===Cancelled sequel===
In 2006, Dyack said &quot;absolutely yes&quot; in response to the question of a possible sequel. He stated that Silicon Knights had intended for &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; to be a stand-alone game, but they wanted to make more games set in the same universe involving the Ancients. At Microsoft&#x27;s Spring 2008 Showcase, Dyack said there was a &quot;strong chance&quot; they would return to the &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; brand. In 2011, Silicon Knights said they were refocusing on one of their most requested titles for the next generation of consoles. This, combined with the fact that Nintendo had trademarked the title once again, spawned rumors that an &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; game would be a launch title for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii U console. However, the project was cancelled due to Silicon Knights&#x27; legal troubles with Epic Games. Any possibility for a sequel from Silicon Knights ended in 2013 when Silicon Knights filed for bankruptcy and closed its offices. Nintendo has repeatedly renewed the &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; trademark, stirring rumors of sequels or re-releases.

===&quot;Shadow of the Eternals&quot;===
In May 2013, Precursor Games, staffed by many former Silicon Knights members, had begun a crowdfunding campaign on their website, seeking $1.5 million to create a spiritual successor to &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; under the title &quot;Shadow of the Eternals&quot;, to be released for Microsoft Windows and Wii U. The game was to be released in twelve 2-4 hour long episodes, with Dyack acting as the game&#x27;s chief creative officer. The same month, a secondary fundraising campaign was launched on Kickstarter, aiming to receive $1.35 million within 36 days. Eventually, being only halfway through their campaign in early June, the company decided to shut down both funding campaigns whilst refunding all the accumulated money back to their contributors, and promised to relaunch a new campaign a few weeks later. They said this was to reveal &quot;a host of a new exciting opportunities that will make the game better than [Precursor Games] envisioned&quot;. Later in June, Precursor&#x27;s founding member, and co-designer of both &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Eternals&quot;, Kenneth McCulloch was arrested and pleaded guilty on charges of child pornography; the studio immediately severed all ties with him.

Another Kickstarter campaign was launched in July, aiming for a $750,000 goal this time. Instead of twelve episodes, the game was intended to be released as one 8-10 hour experience. The game would follow detective Paul Becker as he investigated a gang massacre in Louisiana, and uncovered the truth about the &quot;Eternals&quot;. It would span over 2500 years of history in Hungary, England, Egypt, and the United States. In creating the look of the game, Precursor Games purchased art assets from Silicon Knights which were going to be used in the &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; sequel. Though Nintendo still owns the rights to &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot; and the patent for the game&#x27;s unique &quot;Sanity Meter&quot;, Precursor Games was in communication with Nintendo, who was supportive of the project. In September, &quot;Shadow of the Eternals&quot; was delayed indefinitely due to a lack of funding. &quot;The Escapist&quot; described the multiple failed crowdfunding campaigns as a &quot;circus&quot; and demonstrated a lack of faith in the developers. Kyle Hilliard of &quot;Game Informer&quot; wrote that he was not surprised the game was put on hold, as it has been &quot;plagued with issues&quot; since its first announcement.

In October 2014, Dyack had created a new entertainment company Quantum Entanglement Entertainment. One of the company&#x27;s first projects was to relaunch the development for &quot;Shadow of the Eternals&quot;. Dyack was also considering &quot;Shadow of the Eternals&quot; as a film and television property. In January 2018, QEE was quietly shut down and the production of &quot;Shadow of the Eternals&quot; was cancelled. Dyack renamed the company as Apocalypse Studios and announced a new role-playing game titled &quot;Deadhaus Sonata&quot;. Dyack described it as combining elements of his previous games, including &quot;Lovecraftian overtones from &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="574169" wikidata="Q4923109" url="?curid=574169" title="Blacklight paint">
<text>Black light paint or black light fluorescent paint is luminous paint that glows under a black light. It is based on pigments that respond to light in the ultraviolet segment of the electromagnetic spectrum. The paint may or may not be colorful under ordinary light. Black light paint should not be confused with phosphorescent (glow-in-the-dark) or daylight fluorescent paint.

== History ==
The invention of black light paint is attributed to brothers Joseph and Robert Switzer in the 1930s. After a fall, Robert suffered a severe head injury that resulted in a severed optic nerve. His doctor confined him to a dark room while he waited for his sight to recover. Joseph, who was a chemistry major at the University of California, Berkeley, worked with Robert to investigate fluorescent compounds. They brought a black light into the storeroom of their father&#x27;s drugstore looking for naturally fluorescing organic compounds and mixed those compounds with shellac to develop the first black light fluorescent paints. The first use of these paints was for Joseph&#x27;s amateur magic shows.

The brothers founded the Fluor-S-Art Company, later named Day-Glo Color Corp., to develop and sell their products. &quot;Day-Glo&quot; is a registered trademark of the Day-Glo Color Corporation. The first commercial uses of black light fluorescent paints were for store displays and movie theaters. During World War II, black light fluorescent paints were used on U.S. naval carriers to allow planes to land at night.

== Characteristics and uses ==
Black light paints and inks are commonly used in the production of black light posters. Under daylight, the poster may or may not be vibrant in color, but under black light (with little or no visible light present), the effect produced can be psychedelic. The inks are normally highly sensitive to direct sunlight and other powerful light sources. The fluorescent dyes cause a chemical reaction when exposed to high intensity light sources (HILS) and the visual result is a fading in the colors of the inks. With paper, significant visible change in the color saturation can typically be observed within 45 minutes to one hour of exposure to the HILS. To date, there is no absolute method to prevent this phenomenon, although certain laminations, lacquer coatings and glass or plastic protective sheets can effectively slow the fading characteristics of the dyes.

Other common usage of the black light pigments is in security features of money notes, various certificates printed on paper, meal coupons, tickets and similar things that represent a value (monetary or otherwise). The black light printed figures used for this purpose are usually invisible under normal lighting, even when they are exposed to direct sunlight (which contains ultraviolet light) but they show up glowing when exposed to black light source. This defeats simple and inexpensive attempts to counterfeit them by scanning the original using a high resolution scanner and printing them using an inexpensive high resolution printer (most if not all inexpensive printers do not allow using black light inks for printing) and no special equipment is needed to verify the presence and correctness of this feature (an inexpensive black light source being all that is required). Some coupons and tickets use colorful black light inks.

On many German locomotives the control panel labels were printed with black light paint and a black light source was provided in the cab. This left the driver with full night vision while still enabling him to distinguish between the different switches and levers to operate his locomotive.
Black light paints are sometimes used in the scenery of amusement park dark rides: a black light illuminates the vivid colors of the scenery, while the vehicle and other passengers remain dimly lit or barely visible. This can enhance the effect of being in a fantasy world.

Black light paints may be fluorescent or, more rarely, phosphorescent, containing a phosphor that continues to glow for a time after the black light has been removed. Black light paint can be mixed with similar shades of normal pigments, ‘brightening’ them when viewed in sunlight.

<doc id="574175" wikidata="Q1071461" url="?curid=574175" title="Cigarette Smoking Man">
<text>The Cigarette Smoking Man (abbreviated CSM or C-Man; sometimes referred to as Cancer Man or the Smoking Man) is a fictional character and one of the primary antagonists of the American science fiction drama television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. He serves as the arch-nemesis of FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder. In the show&#x27;s sixth season, his name is said to be C.G.B. Spender, but Dana Scully suggests this is one of &quot;hundreds of aliases&quot;; the show&#x27;s characters and fans continue to refer to him by variations of &quot;the Smoking Man&quot; because he is almost always seen chain-smoking Morley cigarettes, and because he was credited in the pilot episode and other episodes (such as the season 1 finale) as &quot;Smoking Man&quot;. In the eleventh season, he reveals his full name to be Carl Gerhard Busch.

Although he utters only four audible words in the entire first season of the show, the Smoking Man eventually develops into the series&#x27; primary antagonist. In his early appearances, he is seen in the offices of Section Chief Scott Blevins and Assistant Director Walter Skinner, Mulder and his partner Dana Scully&#x27;s supervisors. An influential man working for the powers that be, he is a key member in a government-conspiracy unit known only as the Syndicate, who are hiding the truth of alien existence and their plan to colonize Earth. His power and influence remain strong, even after most of the Syndicate is destroyed.

The Smoking Man is portrayed by Canadian actor William B. Davis. When Davis first took the role, the character was written as an extra for the pilot episode. He returned for small cameo appearances during the first season, making increasingly more appearances in the seasons that followed. Davis never received an award for his portrayal alone, but he was nominated for ensemble awards.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; included him in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.

== Character arc ==
=== Backstory ===
The birth date, birthplace, and most of the history of the Smoking Man are never categorically confirmed. One possible version of his past is provided during the fourth-season episode &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, in which the conspiracy theorists known as The Lone Gunmen claim Smoking Man was first documented in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on August 20, 1940. His father was an ardent communist activist and a spy for the Soviet NKVD who was executed under the Espionage Act of 1917 &quot;before his boy could walk&quot;. His mother was a cigarette smoker who died from lung cancer, also when he was an infant. Since he had no surviving family, he became a ward of the state and was sent to various orphanages in the Midwestern United States. He made no friends and spent most of his time reading. This episode contradicts the season 3 episode &quot;Apocrypha&quot; where young Smoking Man was seen in 1953 with Bill Mulder (Fox Mulder&#x27;s father) as already a shadowy agent and smoking. &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot; has the Smoking Man still a young man and not part of the Syndicate in 1963, and he does not smoke yet.
The same episode reveals that by the early 1960s he was a United States Army Special Forces captain involved in black operations and intelligence, and that he served alongside Bill Mulder. The Smoking Man was already involved in the CIA-backed failed invasion of Cuba and the assassinations of Patrice Lumumba and Rafael Trujillo before he was enlisted by a secret cabal to assassinate President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. The assassination was motivated by Kennedy&#x27;s mishandling of the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the subsequent Cuban Missile Crisis. As part of the mission, the Smoking Man told the designated patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald, to bring the curtain rods as a way to frame him for the murder. By 1968, the Smoking Man had progressed enough in the hierarchy to push himself for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., concerned that King was &quot;talking like a Maoist&quot; and a threat to the American war effort in Vietnam. He did the deed himself because he had &quot;too much respect for the man,&quot; and chose to frame a white racist because of his own sympathy for the American civil rights movement.

At the same time, the Smoking Man was an aspiring writer of espionage (and later, science fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself called Jack Colquitt, based on his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him no choice but to continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man&#x27;s power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved in one way or another on the Anita Hill–Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, California, keeping the United States government from interfering in the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.

Nevertheless, &quot;X-Files&quot; writer Frank Spotnitz stated that this version of events is only one possibility and is not accepted canon.

In the eleventh-season episode &quot;My Struggle III,&quot; the Cigarette-Smoking Man reveals his name to be Carl Gerhard Busch (the name of series creator Chris Carter&#x27;s grandfather). In this backstory, he is shown to have been active back sometime after the Roswell incident and oversaw an experiment on a grey alien. These events preceded the Syndicate, with this new origin retconning the original series run by claiming that the Smoking Man was in fact playing against the Syndicate, despite having previously being seen taking orders from them. He is also confirmed to be the real killer of John F. Kennedy and is seen being present during the faking of the Moon Landing in 1969.

=== Main arc ===
In his first appearance in the series, he oversees FBI agent Dana Scully&#x27;s (Gillian Anderson) briefing and debriefing, and later disposes of evidence Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully had brought back from their investigation of an alien abduction. With the Smoking Man hiding truth from the public, Mulder seeks to reveal it to the public and the truth about the disappearance of his sister, Samantha. This leads to a rivalry that lasts until the end of the series.

In later seasons, it is revealed that he is a member of a group known as the Syndicate, a shadowy organization within the United States government. The episode &quot;Two Fathers&quot; reveals his birth name or alias as C.G.B. Spender, and that he was formerly married to Cassandra Spender, with whom he had a son, Jeffrey Spender. He recruits FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley to be a subordinate of his because she has a close relationship with Mulder. In &quot;One Son&quot;, Jeffrey finds out that his father, the Smoking Man, forced his mother Cassandra to undergo medical treatments that led to several nervous breakdowns during his childhood years. When the Smoking Man finds out, he seemingly kills Jeffrey. Knowing of the colonization plan, the Alien rebels return to Earth to try to persuade the Syndicate to join their side against their war with the Colonists. Not believing in the strength of the Alien rebels, the Syndicate members meet at El Rico Air Base to be transported to a spaceship to survive the colonization. However, the rebels appear instead of the Colonists and kill all remaining chief members of the Syndicate. Together with Fowley, the Smoking Man escapes the destruction of the Syndicate. Later in the sixth season, there is more evidence that suggested that the Smoking Man is Mulder&#x27;s biological father. Eventually in &quot;The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati&quot;, Smoking Man tells Mulder, &quot;I am your father,&quot; while Mulder has a flashback to his childhood of walking on the beach with his parents. Fowley comes in disagreement with him. Because of his plans to kill Mulder, Fowley helps Scully in her investigation to locate Mulder, which leads to her death. After the destruction of the Syndicate, the Smoking Man starts to operate as he wishes. However, his cancer resurfaces, and he begins using a wheelchair and has a tracheotomy. In the end, Alex Krycek and Marita Covarrubias betray him in the episode &quot;Requiem&quot;, throwing him down a flight of stairs, where they presume him to be dead.

The Smoking Man is revealed to be alive in the ninth season episode &quot;William&quot;, where it is also learned that his attempted murder of his son failed, which led him to subject his son to terrible experiments. In the series finale, &quot;The Truth&quot;, Mulder and Scully travel through remote New Mexico and reach a pueblo where a &quot;wise man&quot; reputedly lives: he is, in fact, the Smoking Man. His condition has worsened since his disappearance, and he lives a primitive life in hiding from the &quot;New&quot; Syndicate. After taunting Mulder and Scully, he reveals to Scully what Mulder already knew, that the alien re-colonization of Earth is set for December 22, 2012. Shortly after, Smoking Man is again apparently killed by a rocket shot from a helicopter ordered by Knowle Rohrer.

For the next 14 years, he is presumed dead. However, he appears again alive, but seriously burned and disfigured at the end of &quot;My Struggle&quot; (2016), the first episode of the &quot;X-Files&quot; miniseries, stating that the X-Files have been reopened. In the season finale, &quot;My Struggle II&quot;, the Smoking Man puts into motion the conspiracy he had been working on all these years, releasing chemtrails into the atmosphere which trigger immune system breakdowns throughout the American population, which had been infected by the Spartan virus through mandatory flu vaccinations. Out of fondness for Mulder, he offers him the cure to the disease, but is rebuffed. The United States is thrown into chaos as the Syndicate plan for depopulation gets underway. However, in &quot;My Struggle III&quot;, this is shown to be a vision experienced by Scully. It is revealed that the Smoking Man is trying to find Scully&#x27;s son William in order to fulfill his plans, and that he is in conflict with a group led by two other surviving Syndicate members, who want the Smoking Man dead in order to carry out their own agenda. The Smoking Man approaches Walter Skinner to make him a deal, and offers him a chance to survive the end of humanity in exchange for Skinner helping him find William. The Smoking Man also reveals he was responsible for the creation of William, as he impregnated Scully with the use of alien technology.

In the season 11 finale &quot;My Struggle IV&quot;, the Smoking Man and Reyes follow Mulder, Scully and Skinner to an abandoned factory where they are chasing down William. Skinner points a gun at them and shoots Reyes dead, and the Smoking Man runs Skinner over in his car. The Smoking Man confronts &quot;Mulder&quot; (who is actually William in disguise) by a waterfront, and during the standoff shoots him in the head and causes him to fall into the water. The real Mulder appears and shoots the Smoking Man, who realizes that he has killed William, and he falls off the edge and into the water, with his body then carried away by the current.

== Spin-off media ==
Prior to the tenth televised series of &quot;The X-Files&quot; in 2016, Chris Carter worked with IDW Publishing in 2013 to produce a comic-book continuation of the show. It hints that the Smoking Man is alive and indirectly feeding information to both Mulder and The Lone Gunmen. Carter later said that the story from these comics would be disregarded in future television productions. A variation of the comic-book continuation was made canonical with &quot;The X-Files: Cold Cases&quot;, an Audible adaptation of the series set between the events of the ninth and tenth seasons of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, in which the Smoking Man presented in the series is revealed to be a shape-shifting alien imitating him.

== Characterization ==
Kim Manners, a director of several &quot;X-Files&quot; episodes, said that the Smoking Man was the show&#x27;s version of Darth Vader. Some &quot;X-Files&quot; fans have categorized the Smoking Man as evil, making him out to be the villain. Series creator Chris Carter once called him &quot;the devil&quot;, producing a mixed reaction among fans. Some fans, along with the portraying actor, see him as a hero, as he is forced to make choices others are not.

The Smoking Man is involved in the Syndicate, a shadow organization which includes members of the United States government that exists to hide from the public the fact that aliens are planning to colonize Earth. The Smoking Man often ruthlessly protects the secrets of the conspiracy, and serves as the main antagonist to Mulder, who has an equally consuming devotion to reveal the truth in the first seven seasons. His stated justification is a desire to prevent the alien colonization for as long as possible; in the episode &quot;One Breath&quot;, he tells Mulder that he is in the conspiracy (which he calls &quot;the game&quot;) because he believes that the secrets he keeps could, if publicly revealed, threaten the social order that preserves society: &quot;If people were to know of the things that &quot;I&quot; know... it would all fall apart&quot;. He is at times shown working towards that goal, particularly in connection with developing a vaccine to protect people from the &quot;black oil&quot;, a parasitic agent which the alien Colonists use to propagate themselves.

== Development ==
When first cast for the role, portraying actor William B. Davis thought a show about the paranormal would not last for long. Before joining &quot;The X-Files&quot; cast, Davis had not smoked a cigarette in twenty years. For the first two episodes he appeared in, he smoked &quot;real&quot; cigarettes, but later changed to herbal cigarettes, giving the reason that smoking was dangerous for his health. In at least one early script draft from the &quot;Pilot&quot;, a Special Agent named Lake Drazen is present at the meeting near the start of the episode, having chosen Scully for an assignment to evaluate the validity of Mulder&#x27;s work on the X-Files. The scene was eventually deleted and replaced, and several crew members have hinted that Agent Drazen became the Smoking Man.

Kim Manners said that it seemed all the prominent pieces created for &quot;The X-Files&quot; were created by &quot;accident&quot;. According to Manners, Davis was nothing more than an extra leaning on a shelf. At the start, the producers of the show were not sure about making the Smoking Man the main antagonist. Paul Rabwin commented once that he did not know if Davis could handle the role, because he was not sure if he was a &quot;good enough&quot; actor for the role. Manners later commented that Davis knew that the Smoking Man had two different characters, the first being the one played by Davis and the second was the cigarettes. He further stated that the cigarette smoke could tell a &quot;whole story&quot; by itself, thanks to Davis&#x27;s talent.

Fans of the series were active in debating if the Smoking Man was actually dead after the events of the season five premiere &quot;Redux&quot;. In his first response, Chris Carter said he had left clues in the episode, and he later officially announced that the character would appear in the &quot;X-Files&quot; movie. In one of his last comments on the matter, he said, &quot;Not that we haven&#x27;t brought deceased characters back before, in flashbacks or more paranormal ways. The great thing about &quot;The X-Files&quot; is that anything can happen.&quot;

The Smoking Man is the only character in the series, in addition to Mulder and Scully, to appear in both the first episode, &quot;Pilot&quot; and the last, &quot;The Truth&quot;. Portraying actor William B. Davis was listed as CIA Agent in the first season episode &quot;Young at Heart&quot;, instead of his usual character, the Smoking Man. Chris Owens for a time portrayed the Smoking Man as a young man in flashbacks. He later plays his son, Jeffrey Spender. Young Cigarette Smoking Man was first played by Craig Warkentin, with Davis&#x27; voice dubbed over in &quot;Apocrypha&quot;.

The character was partly inspired by E. Howard Hunt (1918 - 2007), a CIA operative who was allegedly involved in a range of major conspiracies during the mid-20th century, and who also published a series of espionage novels under multiple pen names.

The Smoking Man potentially inspired the portrayal of the videogame series &quot;Half-Life&quot;″s overarching antagonist, the G-Man. Similarities between the two have been pointed out, such as the mysterious, enigmatic nature they share, the references to smoking present in &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot;, and spoken lines themselves, G-Man&#x27;s infamous line &quot;Prepare for unforeseen consequences&quot; bearing a slight resemblance to the Smoking Man&#x27;s line &quot;There have been unforeseen events&quot;.

== Reception ==
While not being nominated for any of his work alone on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, William B. Davis and several other cast members were nominated in the category &quot;Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series&quot; by the Screen Actors Guild Awards in 1997, 1998 and 1999, but did not win. The character was regularly voted &quot;The Nastiest Villain&quot; on television polls during the &#x27;90s. &quot;TV Guide&quot; listed Cigarette Smoking Man 20th in their &quot;25 Greatest TV Villains&quot; list. According to the portraying actor, the character had garnered protest from &quot;pro-smokers&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Jennifer Armstrong cited the character as an example of the old tradition of having only &quot;bad guys&quot; smoking on television.

Davis was included in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the 50 Biggest Emmy Snubs, the list&#x27;s author saying that the presence of the &quot;Cigarette Smoking Man&quot; was as important as &quot;black oil, alien implants, and Scully&#x27;s skepticism&quot;. The Malaysian newspaper the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; called the Smoking Man one of the most &quot;intriguing&quot; characters of the show. However, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; said that the mystery behind the Smoking Man had evaporated by the late season episodes. Likewise, Ken Tucker from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that &quot;the monotonous evil of Cancer Man&quot; had &quot;become actively annoying&quot; in later seasons of the show, being that his lurking presence did not seem as mysterious anymore. &quot;Salon&quot; reviewer Jeff Stark felt the show was at its best when you &quot;didn&#x27;t exactly know the motivations of the Smoking Man&quot;.

<doc id="574178" wikidata="Q5645409" url="?curid=574178" title="Hamish and Dougal">
<text>Hamish and Dougal are two characters from the long-running BBC Radio 4 radio comedy panel game &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, played by Barry Cryer and Graeme Garden, who later went on to have their own Radio 4 series, You&#x27;ll Have Had Your Tea: The Doings of Hamish and Dougal. The series is occasionally broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s repeat station, Radio 4 Extra.

==History==
The fictional characters Hamish and Dougal originated in one of the rounds of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; called Sound Charades. In this round the title of a book or film has to be conveyed from one team to the other by means of a story; the result of the story is usually a pun on the title in question. The panellists Cryer and Garden often tell their story as Hamish and Dougal, who are two elderly Scottish gentlemen. One of the characters was originally called Angus. The duo continued with the characters, according to Garden &quot;mainly because (fellow panellist) Tim Brooke-Taylor hated them&quot;. Garden refers to a cousin Hamish during an episode of the Goodies in 1975. A prototype Hamish and Dougal first appeared in a 1979 Christmas Special of &#x27;Clue&#x27;, doing &#x27;Wee Freak Ings Of Orient Are&#x27;, with John Junkin standing in for Barry Cryer. However, the characters didn&#x27;t appear fully formed until the 1995 Christmas Special, when the duo gave the clue for &#x27;The Queen&#x27;s Peach&#x27;. Hamish and Dougal then became the focus of a spin-off show called &quot;You&#x27;ll Have Had Your Tea: The Doings of Hamish and Dougal&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;Hamish and Dougal&quot; on the packaging of the official CD releases. 

The spin-off show was named in reference to the fact that the characters&#x27; sketches on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; began with a variant of the line &quot;You&#x27;ll have had your tea then, Hamish&quot;. This refers to an idiom used in Edinburgh, where a visitor who has dropped in at &quot;tea&quot; (a colloquial term for an evening meal) is informed that the host does not intend to feed them. The stereotype of Scottish people being careful with their money is regularly played on in the series.

Episodes were 15 minutes long and were extensions of the one-minute sketches. The series featured two other actors: regular &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; panelist Jeremy Hardy, and Alison Steadman. Steadman played Mrs Naughtie the housekeeper, while Hardy played the local laird. The announcer was BBC newsreader Brian Perkins. The music for the series was arranged by Graeme&#x27;s son Jon Garden and performed by a four-piece ceilidh band. The programmes were produced by Jon Naismith. Other actors have also featured in guest appearances, such as the 2004 Hogmanay special which featured guest appearances from &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; chairman Humphrey Lyttelton, as the Laird&#x27;s butler Lyttelton, &quot;Today programme&quot; presenter Jim Naughtie (as Mrs Naughtie&#x27;s long-lost son), Sandi Toksvig (as Sandi Wedge, a very tall golf champion) and Tim Brooke-Taylor and Colin Sell (as themselves).

The show relied heavily on sexual innuendo, and Scottish stereotypes. Long-running jokes from the parent series were frequently referred to, such as the quality of Hardy&#x27;s singing voice, which is occasionally excruciatingly demonstrated in the series, it is thought that Hardy&#x27;s character The Laird&#x27;s favorite band is Atomic Kitten having sung &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; In Series 1 Episode 1 - The Musical Evening and &quot;The Tide Is High&quot; in Series 1 Episode 4 - The Shooting Party. 

Fictitious place-names used within the series include Ben Kingsley, Loch Krankie, and Glen Close.

A book of the complete scripts from all three series plus the Hogmanay and Burns Night specials was published in hardback by Preface Publishing on 28 August 2008 entitled &quot;The Doings of Hamish and Dougal: You&#x27;ll Have Had Your Tea?&quot;. The book also includes comedy cooking recipes created by Garden and poems.

==Critical reception==
The series has been described as &quot;reality-based comedy at its finest&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot;, and as &quot;basically &quot;The Beano&quot; with added smut&quot; by &quot;The Independent&quot;. Gavin Docherty of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; said, after reading the book of scripts, &quot;I laughed so hard my head nearly fell off&quot;.

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; gave the series a negative review, with Robert McNeil describing the series as one in which &quot;two clapped-out has-beens (except they never-weres) put on ridiculous Scottish voices and enact quasi-racist routines&quot;. Cryer denied that the show is anti-Scottish saying the series was &quot;an affectionate laugh at all things Scottish. Graeme is half Scottish. I am borderline, having been born in Cumbria&quot; (although reference sources generally state that he came from Yorkshire). Garden stated that in the series they were sending up the stereotypes of Scots rather than Scots themselves (which makes it all right).

<text>The Prussian Ministry of War was the highest state authority of the Prussian Army and was responsible for the central administration of the army of the Kingdom of Prussia and, later, the Imperial German Army. The ministry existed from 1808 through the establishment of the German Empire and was dissolved in 1919, being succeeded by the Ministry of the Reichswehr.

==Formation==
The Prussian Ministry of War was gradually established between 1808 and 1809 as part of a series of reforms initiated by the Military Reorganization Commission created after the disastrous Treaties of Tilsit. The War Ministry was to help bring the Army under constitutional review, and, along with the General Staff, systematize the conduct of warfare. Gerhard von Scharnhorst, the most prominent and influential of the reformers, served as acting Minister of War from roughly 1808 until 1810 (he was also concurrently Chief of the General Staff).

The War Ministry was established on 25 December 1808, replacing the existing military institutions. The Ministry initially consisted of two departments. The first department was responsible for the command and condition of the army, the second for its financial administration.

At first, no Minister of War was appointed due to resistance from Frederick William III, the King of Prussia. Gerhard von Scharnhorst became head of the first department (the General War Department or &quot;Allgemeines Kriegsdepartement&quot;) and Lieutenant Colonel Graf Lottum became head of the second department. Scharnhorst also functioned as acting Minister of War, as long as no permanent appointment was made.

The first department initially consisted of three divisions. The first division represented the continuation of the old Prussian Adjutancy-General and was also known as the &quot;Privy Military Cabinet&quot; (&quot;Geheimes Kriegskabinett&quot;). It in turn had control over the General War Chancellery (&quot;Allgemeine Kriegskanzlei&quot;). The second division dealt with general army matters, including troop formation, replacements and turnover, accommodations, military exercises and mobilization. A third division was also created, the artillery and engineering department. This in turn comprised the artillery section, which dealt with artillery equipment, rifle production, cannon foundries, powder factories, etc., and the engineering section, which was primarily responsible for the maintenance of fortifications.

The second department, the military economy department (&quot;Militär-Ökonomie Departement&quot;), had four divisions. The first division was responsible for pay, the second for provisioning, the third for clothing and the fourth for invalids.

10. War Raw Materials Section (&quot;Kriegs-Rohstoff-Abteilung&quot;) (KRA)

Over the course of the war, further reorganizations would take place, most importantly with regard to the organization of the war economy. Among the most significant was the establishment of the War Office (&quot;Kriegsamt&quot;) and the &quot;&quot;.

==Prussian Ministers of War, 1808–1919==
Scharnhorst was succeeded by &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Karl von Hake, who served as minister from 1810 to 1813 and from 1819 to 1833. Hermann von Boyen, another prominent reformer alongside Scharnhorst, served as minister from 1813 to 1819 and again from 1841-to 1847 and was promoted to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; in 1847.

Among other long-serving ministers was Albrecht Graf von Roon, who served as minister from 1859 to 1873, during the Second Schleswig War (1864), the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) and was promoted to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; in 1873. &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; Georg von Kameke succeeded Graf von Roon and served from 1873 to 1883.

Karl von Einem would serve as minister from 1903 to 1909 and would be recalled in World War I, commanding the 3rd Army from 1914 to 1918. Erich von Falkenhayn was named Minister of War on 7 June 1913 and held the office during the opening stages of World War I. He would succeed Helmuth von Moltke the Younger as Chief of the General Staff from 14 September 1914 to 29 August 1916. Falkenhayn was briefly concurrently minister and chief of the general staff until 21 January 1915, when Adolf Wild von Hohenborn succeeded him as minister. Wild von Hohenborn was dismissed on 29 October 1916 and replaced by Hermann von Stein, who held the office until shortly before the end of the war. Stein was succeeded on 9 October 1918 by Heinrich Schëuch, though by that point much of the ministry&#x27;s responsibilities had been assumed by the higher military staff under Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. Walther Reinhardt would serve as the last Prussian Minister of War in 1919.

==Locations==

For one hundred years, from 1 January 1819 to 1 January 1919 (when the ministry ceased to exist), it was located in the Friedrichstadt quarter of what is today Berlin-Mitte:

The main building was on &quot;Leipziger Straße 5&quot; facing south, with the garden bordering on the Prinz-Albrecht-Palais (demolished in 1935 to erect the Ministry of Aviation building). Additional offices were later established in other parts of Berlin.
* &quot;Wilhelmstrasse 81&quot; - used from 1824.
* &quot;Behrenstraße 66&quot; - used by the General Staff after approximately 1820, transferred to the War Ministry from 1871. From 1900 it was used by the Military Cabinet. The building is now the rear part of offices belonging to the Russian Embassy.
* &quot;Hinter dem Gießhaus 2&quot; (behind the Zeughaus) - used by the Military Cabinet from 1820 to 1900.

A new building was built for the General Staff between 1867 and 1871 in the Tiergarten at the Königsplatz (now the &quot;Platz der Republik&quot;), with its western corner facing the Moltkestraße.

<text> is a sub-kilometer sized asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group. It was discovered on 4 December 1997, by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program at Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States.

== Orbit and classification ==

The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9–1.3 AU once every 13 months (408 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic.

It has an &quot;Earth minimum orbital intersection distance&quot; of 0.000135 AU, which corresponds to 0.05 lunar distances. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation, as no precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made.

== Impact risk ==

Between 2002 and 2006, was considered to have about a 1 in 10,000 chance of colliding with Earth on 1 June 2101, based on a 27-day observation arc following its discovery. With an estimated mass of kilograms, it was ranked at level 1 on the Torino scale (0–10) of impact risk, and was the only near-Earth object to be ranked higher than zero until it was joined by at level 1 in November 2004, and then when 99942 Apophis – then known only by its provisional designation – was temporarily assessed at level four in December 2004. Both and 99942 Apophis are now rated at level zero.

=== Recovery ===

On 24 February 2006, was observed by the Mount Lemmon Survey after being lost for more than 8 years. The refinement of its orbit eliminated the possibility of impact in 2101. It is now known that on 20 November 2101, the asteroid will be from Earth.

== Physical characteristics ==

According to a generic conversion of absolute magnitude to diameter, measures 200 to 230 meters.

== Naming ==

As of 2017, this minor planet remains unnamed.

<doc id="574185" wikidata="Q77117" url="?curid=574185" title="Bertha Benz">
<text>Bertha Benz (; ; 3 May 1849 – 5 May 1944) was a German automotive pioneer. She was the business partner, investor and wife of automobile inventor Carl Benz. On 5 August 1888, she was the first person to drive an internal-combustion-engined automobile over a long distance, field testing the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, inventing brake lining and solving several practical issues during the journey of 105 km (65 miles). In doing so, she brought the Patent-Motorwagen worldwide attention and got their company its first sales. Bertha Benz was not allowed to study in the Grand Duchy of Baden, and her financial and practical engineering contributions have long been overlooked until the 21st century.

==Early life and education==
Cäcilie Bertha Ringer was born on 3 May 1849 to a wealthy carpenter family in Pforzheim. She was the third of nine children. Her father, Karl Friedrich Ringer, a master builder and carpenter, and her 20 year younger mother, Auguste Friedrich, were wealthy individuals who invested heavily in their children&#x27;s educations. in Pforzheim in the Grand Duchy of Baden. Her father became wealthy by speculating with real estate. She attended a boarding school in Pforzheim for 10 years and was known for her ambition and fascination with technological innovation, but could not pursue higher education, as women were not allowed to attend university at the time.

On 27 June 1869, during an excursion by the Eintracht Club, she met and fell in love with machine lover and tinkerer Carl Benz, who was five years her senior and penniless, but had a head full of crazy ideas, and who could talk better about technology than about feelings.
In 1870, two years before her marriage, she used part of her dowry to invest in his failing iron construction company. As an unmarried woman, she was able to do so; after she married Benz, according to German law, Bertha lost her legal power to act as an investor.

==Adult life==
On 20 July 1872, Bertha Ringer married Karl Benz. 

Thanks to her premarital financial support, Karl Benz moved on from his failing iron construction company to a new manufacturing venture, Benz &amp; Cie, continuing to use her dowry as financial support, to pursue his lifelong dream of the first true automobile. In 1875/76, when Bertha was pregnant with her third child, the bailiff had their workshop emptied, because they could no longer pay their debts. 
But they continued and on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1879, the two were able to get a two-stroke engine to work for the first time. Eventually, in December 1885, they finished work on the first horseless carriage, 13 years into their marriage. Karl Benz applied for the patent, but Bertha could not legally apply alongside him despite her financial and practical engineering contributions.
With cutting-edge bicycle constructions, the Model I Patent-Motorwagen was the original Patent Motor Car and the world&#x27;s first automobile. The Model II was converted to a four-wheeler for test purposes, making it the only one of this model.
On 3 July 1886, Karl Benz presented the Patent-Motorwagen automobile to the public in Mannheim. It had powered rear wheels with a ringed steel and solid rubber, steerable front wheel and optional seat arrangements and a folding top. Karl Benz was a poor marketer and faced competition by Gottlieb Daimler, which prompted his wife to undertake the test drive in 1888. 
===First cross-country automobile journey, 1888===

On 5 August 1888, 39-year-old Bertha Benz drove from Mannheim to Pforzheim with her sons Richard and Eugen, thirteen and fifteen years old respectively, in a Model III, without telling her husband and without permission of the authorities, thus becoming the first person to drive an automobile a significant distance. Before this historic trip, motorized drives were merely very short trials, returning to the point of origin, made with assistance of mechanics. Following wagon tracks, this pioneering tour covered a one-way distance of about .
Although the ostensible purpose of the trip was to visit her mother, Bertha Benz had other motives – to prove to her husband, who had failed to adequately consider marketing his invention, that the automobile in which they both had heavily invested would become a financial success once it was shown to be useful to the general public; and to give her husband the confidence that his constructions had a future.

She left Mannheim around dawn, solving numerous problems along the way. Bertha demonstrated her significant technical capabilities on this journey. With no fuel tank and only a 4.5-litre supply of petrol in the carburetor, she had to find ligroin, the petroleum solvent needed for the car to run. The solvent was only available at apothecary shops, so she stopped in Wiesloch at the city pharmacy, Stadt-Apotheke, to purchase the fuel. At the time, petrol and other fuels could only be bought from chemists [pharmacists in US English], and so this is how the chemist in Wiesloch became the first fuel station in the world.

She cleaned a blocked fuel line with her hat pin and used her garter as insulation material. A blacksmith had to help mend a chain at one point. When the wooden brakes began to fail, Benz visited a cobbler to install leather, making the world&#x27;s first pair of brake linings. An evaporative cooling system was employed to cool the engine, making water supply a big worry along the trip. The trio added water to their supply every time they stopped. The car&#x27;s two gears were not enough to surmount uphill inclines and Eugen and Richard often had to push the vehicle up steep roads. Benz reached Pforzheim somewhat after dusk, notifying her husband of her successful journey by telegram. She drove back to Mannheim several days later.

The trip was officially forbidden and Benz risked a penalty. There were no suitable roads and signs, only a few signposts. It was life-threatening because of the fragility of the car and the road conditions. The wagon was three-wheeled, but the paths were driven by four-wheeled horse-drawn carriages, so the dainty front wheel rattled over tufts of grass, sticks and stones.

The trip received a great deal of publicity, as she had sought, and was a key event in the technical development of the automobile. She reported everything that had happened along the way and made important suggestions, such as the introduction of an additional gear for climbing hills and brake linings to improve brake-power. The pioneering couple introduced several improvements after Bertha&#x27;s experiences. Her trip demonstrated to the burgeoning automotive industry that test drives were essential to their business.

===1889–1929===
After Bertha&#x27;s test drive, Benz &amp; Cie. became the world’s largest automobile company.

In 1906, the family moved to Ladenburg, where Karl, Bertha, and sons Eugen and Richard started another solely family-held automobile business, named Benz Sons (Benz Söhne), which remained family-owned. It folded in 1924 after years of German inflation 1914 to 1923.

In 1925, Karl Benz wrote the following in his memoirs: &quot;Only one person remained with me in the small ship of life when it seemed destined to sink. That was my wife. Bravely and resolutely she set the new sails of hope.&quot;

In 1926, Benz &amp; Cie. merged with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach&#x27;s company to form Daimler-Benz, which became home to the Mercedes-Benz. Karl Benz died in 1929 with the beginning of the Great Depression.

===1929–1944===
Withdrawn from the outside world, Bertha Benz lived out the remainder of her life in her villa in Ladenburg. Her fortunes had shrunk due to World War I and hyperinflation, but it did not seem to bother her, as she was accustomed to living modestly to the point of miserliness all her life. The misery of the people affected by the high level of unemployment impressed on her, and she wrote to a journalist that she would like to make her books available for a library so that unemployed people could at least read. In 1933, 84-year-old Bertha Benz is said to have greeted Adolf Hitler as the &quot;savior of Germans&quot;. She and her family were very quickly co-opted by Nazi propaganda, and as early as Easter 1933, a National Socialist memorial was inaugurated for Carl Benz in Mannheim, in which Bertha participated. She later distanced herself from Hitler when she understood that his policies were leading to a new war.

On her 95th birthday, on 3 May 1944, she received the title of Honorary Senator of the Technical University of Karlsruhe, where her husband had studied – women were not allowed to study during her youth.

==Personal life and death==
On 20 July 1872, Bertha Ringer married Karl Benz. Together they had five children: Eugen (1873–1958), Richard (1874–1955), Clara (1876–1968), Thilde (1882–1974), and Ellen (1890–1973).

The Mannheimer Morgen quoted Bertha as &quot;enterprising mother of five [who] led a strict regime. Karl Benz is described by contemporary witnesses as a &quot;serious and just person&quot;, while his wife is said to have had an &quot;aggressive nature&quot;.&quot; 

Bertha Benz died at age 95 in her village in Ladenburg on 5 May 1944.

==Posthumous honours, 21st century==

In 2008, the Bertha Benz Memorial Route was officially approved as a route of the industrial heritage of humankind, because it follows Bertha Benz&#x27;s path during the world&#x27;s first long-distance journey by automobile in 1888. Now it is possible to follow the 194 km of signs indicating her route from Mannheim via Heidelberg to Pforzheim (Black Forest) and back.

The &quot;Bertha Benz Challenge&quot;, embedded in the framework of the ceremony of &quot;Automobile Summer 2011&quot;, the big official German event and birthday party commemorating the invention of the automobile by Carl Benz over , took place on Bertha Benz Memorial Route on 10 and 11 September 2011. It was a globally visible signal for new automobile breakthroughs, and was only open for sustainable mobility – future-oriented vehicles with alternative drive systems, &quot;i.e.&quot;, hybrid and electric, hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles, and other extremely economical vehicles. The motto is &quot;Bertha Benz Challenge – Sustainable Mobility on the World&#x27;s Oldest Automobile Road!&quot;

On 25 January 2011, Deutsche Welle (DW-TV) broadcast worldwide in its series, &quot;Made in Germany&quot;, a TV documentary on the invention of the automobile by Carl Benz, highlighting the very important role of his wife, Bertha Benz. The report is not only on the history of the automobile, but took a look at its future, shown by the Bertha Benz Challenge on 10 and 11 September 2011.

The 2011 documentary &quot;The Car is Born&quot;, produced by Ulli Kampelmann, centered on the first road trip by Bertha Benz.

In 2016, she was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame, 42 years after her husband was inducted.
In honor of International Women&#x27;s Day in 2019, the modern Daimler company commissioned a four-minute advertisement dramatizing portions of Bertha Benz’ 1888 journey. The ad was created by Berlin-based ad agency Antoni (the lead European agency for Mercedes-Benz), and directed by Sebastian Strasser via his production company, Anorak Film.

The Benz home has been designated as historic and is used as a scientific meeting facility for a nonprofit foundation, the Daimler and Benz Foundation, which aims to promote science and research in order to gain a better understanding of the correlation between man, the environment and technology.

<text>The Polish National Catholic Church (PNCC; , PNKK) is an independent Old Catholic church based in the United States and founded by Polish-Americans.

The PNCC is in communication with 
(and limited intercommunion with) the Roman Catholic Church. Since 2004, the PNCC is no longer in communion with the Union of Utrecht. The organisation is now part of the Union of Scranton. 

The church has around 30,000 members in five dioceses in the United States and Canada with 119 congregations in the US. The church is part of Polish Old Catholicism.

== History ==
During the late 19th century, many Polish immigrants to the U.S. became dismayed with the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. The U.S. church had no Polish bishops and few Polish priests, and would not allow the Polish language to be taught in parish schools. The mainly ethnic Irish and German bishops helped establish hundreds of parishes for Poles, but priests were usually unable to speak Polish, and the new immigrants had poor or limited English. There were also disputes over who owned church property, particularly in Buffalo, New York, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, with the parishioners demanding greater control. Although the majority of Polish-Americans remained with the Roman Catholic Church, where bilingual Polish-American priests and bishops were eventually ordained, many Polish-Americans in the meantime came to believe that these conditions were a manifestation of &quot;political and social exploitation of the Polish people&quot;.

A leader in this struggle was Fr. Franciszek Hodur (1866–1953), a Polish immigrant to the United States and a Catholic priest. Born near Kraków, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1893 and was ordained that year; in 1897, he became pastor of St. Stanislaus Cathedral in Scranton. Continued discontent led to an open rupture with the U.S. Catholic Church in 1897, when Polish immigrants founded an independent Polish body, headquartered in Scranton, with initially some 20,000 members. Fr. Hodur was consecrated as a bishop in 1907 in Utrecht, Netherlands, by three Old Catholic bishops. The PNCC considers him to be the founder and first bishop of the denomination. 

The church began missionary work in Poland after the country regained independence following World War I. By the beginning of World War II, the PNCC had founded more than 50 parishes along with a theological seminary in Kraków. During post-war Communist rule of Poland, the church suffered severe persecution. The Polish Catholic Church is now an autocephalous body in communion with the PNCC.

In 2002, Robert M. Nemkovich was elected by the twenty-first general synod to be the sixth prime bishop of the Polish National Catholic Church.

In 2010, Anthony Mikovsky was elected by the twenty-third general synod to be the seventh prime bishop of the Polish National Catholic Church. Bishop Mikovsky has been bishop of the Central Diocese and pastor of St. Stanislaus Cathedral since 2006. Before becoming a bishop, he served as the assistant pastor at St. Stanislaus, the mother church of the denomination, beginning in 1997.
==Beliefs==
===Marriage and divorce===
The church believes that &quot;Marriage is the sacrament which makes a Christian man and woman husband and wife, gives them grace to be faithful to each other and to bring up their children in love and devotion to God.&quot; Unlike in the Roman Catholic Church, PNCC deacons are not permitted to officiate at weddings. The PNCC permits divorced people to participate fully in the Mass and to receive the Eucharist. The church does not recognize civil divorce and requires an annulment before parishioners can remarry.

Since 1921, the PNCC has permitted bishops and priests to marry.

===Governance===
The PNCC is governed in accordance with its Constitution and Laws.

The chief legislative body is a general synod, which normally convenes every four years. The composition of the PNCC General Synod includes clergy and laity. Each parish is entitled to send one lay delegate for each 50 active members. While its constitution and canon laws provide that the PNCC General Synod holds the authority to remove bishops, the Prime Bishop purported to remove the bishop of the Polish National Catholic Church of Canada in January 2013.

== Ecumenical relationships ==
The PNCC is a member of the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches.

In the 1970s the PNCC&#x27;s relationship with the Utrecht Union grew strained as there was a gradual shift towards what was regarded as liberalism in the rest of Utrecht Union churches while the PNCC was becoming more conservative. The PNCC in the United States and Canada entered into a state of &quot;impaired communion&quot; with the Utrecht Union in 1997, since the PNCC did not accept the validity of ordaining women to the priesthood, which most other Utrecht Union churches had been doing for several years. The PNCC continued to refuse full communion with those churches that ordained women; thus, in 2003 the International Old Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference expelled the PNCC from the Utrecht Union, determining that &quot;full communion, as determined in the statute of the IBC, could not be restored and that therefore, as a consequence, the separation of our Churches follows&quot;.

Dialogue with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, with the approval of the Holy See, led in 1996 to an arrangement that Laurence J. Orzell has called &quot;limited inter-communion&quot;. What this means is that the Catholic Church recognizes the validity of the sacraments of the PNCC, and allows members of the Latin Church and Eastern Catholic Churches in particular exceptional circumstances, defined in canon 844 of the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; of the Latin Church and the parallel canon 671 of the &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot;, that are regulated by the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops, to receive three sacraments from PNCC ministers. Canon 844 allows those Catholics who can avoid error and indifferentism and are unable to approach a Catholic minister to receive, under certain conditions, the sacraments of Reconciliation, Eucharist, and Anointing of the Sick from &quot;non-Catholic ministers, ministers in whose churches these sacraments are valid&quot;. This canon declares it licit for Catholic priests to administer the same three sacraments to members of churches which the Holy See judges to be in the same condition in regard to the sacraments as the Eastern churches, if they ask for the sacraments of their own accord and are properly disposed. Obstacles to full communion include different understandings about papal primacy, the level of involvement of the laity in church governance, and the PNCC reception of some former Roman Catholic clergy, most of whom subsequently married.

The PNCC has been also in ecumenical dialogue since 2018 with numerous jurisdictions from the continuing Anglican movement: the Anglican Catholic Church, the Anglican Province of America, and the Anglican Church in America—commonly referred to as the G-3. Progress has been steady, and the potential for full communion is on the horizon and nearing quickly.

<doc id="574203" wikidata="Q1427313" url="?curid=574203" title="Sacred bull">
<text>Cattle are prominent in some religions and mythologies. As such, numerous peoples throughout the world have at one point in time honored bulls as sacred. In the Sumerian religion, Marduk is the &quot;bull of Utu&quot;. In Hinduism, Shiva&#x27;s steed is Nandi, the Bull. The sacred bull survives in the constellation Taurus. The bull, whether lunar as in Mesopotamia or solar as in India, is the subject of various other cultural and religious incarnations as well as modern mentions in New Age cultures.

== In prehistoric art ==

Aurochs are depicted in many Paleolithic European cave paintings such as those found at Lascaux and Livernon in France. Their life force may have been thought to have magical qualities, for early carvings of the aurochs have also been found. The impressive and dangerous aurochs survived into the Iron Age in Anatolia and the Near East and were worshipped throughout that area as sacred animals; the earliest remnants of bull worship can be found at neolithic Çatalhöyük.

== In antiquity ==
=== Mesopotamia ===

The Sumerian guardian deity called lamassu was depicted as hybrids with bodies of either winged bulls or lions and heads of human males. The motif of a winged animal with a human head is common to the Near East, first recorded in Ebla around 3000 BCE. The first distinct lamassu motif appeared in Assyria during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser II as a symbol of power.

&quot;&quot;The human-headed winged bulls protective genies called shedu or lamassu, ... were placed as guardians at certain gates or doorways of the city and the palace. Symbols combining man, bull, and bird, they offered protection against enemies.&quot;

The bull was also associated with the storm and rain god Adad, Hadad or Iškur. The bull was his symbolic animal. He appeared bearded, often holding a club and thunderbolt while wearing a bull-horned headdress. Hadad was equated with the Greek god Zeus; the Roman god Jupiter, as Jupiter Dolichenus; the Indo-European Nasite Hittite storm-god Teshub; the Egyptian god Amun. When Enki distributed the destinies, he made Iškur inspector of the cosmos. In one litany, Iškur is proclaimed again and again as &quot;great radiant bull, your name is heaven&quot;&quot; and also called son of Anu, lord of Karkara; twin-brother of Enki, lord of abundance, lord who rides the storm, lion of heaven.

The Sumerian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; depicts the horrors of the rage-fueled deployment of the Bull of Heaven by Ishtar and its slaughter by Gilgamesh and Enkidu as an act of defiance that seals their fates:
Ishtar opened her mouth and said again, &quot;My father, give me the Bull of Heaven to destroy Gilgamesh. Fill Gilgamesh, I say, with arrogance to his destruction; but if you refuse to give me the Bull of Heaven I will break in the doors of hell and smash the bolts; there will be a confusion of people, those above with those from the lower depths. I shall bring up the dead to eat food like the living; and the hosts of the dead will outnumber the living.&quot; Anu said to great Ishtar, &quot;If I do what you desire there will be seven years of drought throughout Uruk when corn will be seedless husks. Have you saved grain enough for the people and grass for the cattle?&quot; Ishtar replied &quot;I have saved grain for the people, grass for the cattle.&quot;...When Anu heard what Ishtar had said he gave her the Bull of Heaven to lead by the halter down to Uruk. When they reached the gates of Uruk the Bull of Heaven went to the river; with his first snort cracks opened in the earth and a hundred young men fell down to death. With his second snort cracks opened and two hundred fell down to death. With his third snort cracks opened, Enkidu doubled over but instantly recovered, he dodged aside and leapt onto the Bull and seized it by the horns. The Bull of Heaven foamed in his face, it brushed him with the thick of its tail. Enkidu cried to Gilgamesh, &quot;My friend we boasted that we would leave enduring names behind us. Now thrust your sword between the nape and the horns.&quot; So Gilgamesh followed the Bull, he seized the thick of its tail, he thrust the sword between the nape and the horns and slew the Bull. When they had killed the Bull of Heaven they cut out its heart and gave it to Shamash, and the brothers rested.
=== Egypt ===

In Ancient Egypt multiple sacred bulls were worshiped. A long succession of ritually perfect bulls were identified by the god&#x27;s priests, housed in the temple for their lifetime, then embalmed and buried. The mother-cows of these animals were also revered, and buried in separate locations.

* In the Memphite region, the Apis was seen as the embodiment of Ptah and later of Osiris. Some of the Apis bulls were buried in large sarcophagi in the underground vaults of the Serapeum of Saqqara, which was rediscovered by Auguste Mariette in 1851.
* Mnevis of Heliopolis was the embodiment of Atum-Ra.
* Buchis of Hermonthis was linked with the gods Ra and Montu. The catacombs for these bulls are now known as the Bucheum. Multiple Buchis mummies were found in situ during excavations in the 1930s. Some of their sarcophagi are similar to those in the Serapeum, others are polylithic (made from multiple stones).

Ka, in Egyptian, is both a religious concept of life-force/power and the word for bull. Andrew Gordon, an Egyptologist, and Calvin Schwabe, a veterinarian, argue that the origin of the ankh is related to two other signs of uncertain origin that often appear alongside it: the &quot;was&quot;-sceptre, representing &quot;power&quot; or &quot;dominion&quot;, and the &quot;djed&quot; pillar, representing &quot;stability&quot;. According to this hypothesis, the form of each sign is drawn from a part of the anatomy of a bull, like some other hieroglyphic signs that are known to be based on body parts of animals. In Egyptian belief semen was connected with life and, to some extent, with &quot;power&quot; or &quot;dominion&quot;, and some texts indicate the Egyptians believed semen originated in the bones. Therefore, Calvin and Schwabe suggest the signs are based on parts of the bull&#x27;s anatomy through which semen was thought to pass: the ankh is a thoracic vertebra, the &quot;djed&quot; is the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, and the &quot;was&quot; is the dried penis of the bull.

=== Central Anatolia ===

We cannot recreate a specific context for the bull skulls with horns (&quot;bucrania&quot;) preserved in an 8th millennium BCE sanctuary at Çatalhöyük in Central Anatolia. The sacred bull of the Hattians, whose elaborate standards were found at Alaca Höyük alongside those of the sacred stag, survived in Hurrian and Hittite mythology as Seri and Hurri (&quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Night&quot;), the bulls who carried the weather god Teshub on their backs or in his chariot and grazed on the ruins of cities.

=== Crete ===

Bulls were a central theme in the Minoan civilization, with bull heads and bull horns used as symbols in the Knossos palace. Minoan frescos and ceramics depict bull-leaping, in which participants of both sexes vaulted over bulls by grasping their horns.

=== Iran ===

The Iranian language texts and traditions of Zoroastrianism have several different mythological bovine creatures. One of these is Gavaevodata, which is the Avestan name of a hermaphroditic &quot;uniquely created (&quot;-aevo.data&quot;) cow (&quot;gav-&quot;)&quot;, one of Ahura Mazda&#x27;s six primordial material creations that becomes the mythological progenitor of all beneficent animal life. Another Zoroastrian mythological bovine is Hadhayans, a gigantic bull so large that it could straddle the mountains and seas that divide the seven regions of the earth, and on whose back men could travel from one region to another. In medieval times, Hadhayans also came to be known as Srīsōk (Avestan *&quot;Thrisaok&quot;, &quot;three burning places&quot;), which derives from a legend in which three &quot;Great Fires&quot; were collected on the creature&#x27;s back. Yet another mythological bovine is that of the unnamed creature in the &quot;Cow&#x27;s Lament&quot;, an allegorical hymn attributed to Zoroaster himself, in which the soul of a bovine (&quot;geush urvan&quot;) despairs over her lack of protection from an adequate herdsman. In the allegory, the cow represents humanity&#x27;s lack of moral guidance, but in later Zoroastrianism, Geush Urvan became a yazata representing cattle. The 14th day of the month is named after her and is under her protection.

=== South Asia and South East Asia ===
==== The Indian Subcontinent ====

Bulls appear on seals from the Indus Valley civilisation.

==== Vedic period ====
In &quot;The Rig Veda&quot;, the earliest collection of Vedic hymns (c. 1500-1000 BCE), Indra is often praised as a Bull (Vṛṣabha – &quot;vrsa&quot; (he) plus &quot;bha&quot; (being) or as &quot;uksan&quot;, a bull aged five to nine years, which is still growing or just reached its full growth). The bull is an icon of power and virile strength in Aryan literature and other Indo-European traditions. &quot;Vrsha&quot; means &quot;to shower or to spray&quot;, in this context Indra showers strength and virility. Vṛṣabha is also an astrological sign in Indian horoscope systems, corresponding to Taurus

The storm god Rudra is called a bull as are the Maruts or storm deities referred to as bulls under the command of Indra, thus Indra is called &quot;bull with bulls.&quot; The following excerpts from &quot;The Rig Veda&quot; demonstrate these attributes:

&quot;As a bull I call to you, the bull with the thunderbolt, with various aids, O Indra, bull with bulls, greatest killer of Vrtra.&quot; — &quot;Atri and the Last Sun&quot;

&quot;He the mighty bull who with his seven reins let loose the seven rivers to flow, who with his thunderbolt in his hand hurled down Ruhina as he was climbing up to the sky, he my people is Indra.&quot; — &quot;Who is Indra?&quot;

&quot;I send praise to the high bull, tawny and white. I bow low to the radiant one. We praise the dreaded name of Rudra.&quot; — &quot;Rudra, father of the Maruts.&quot;

Nandi later appears in the Puranas as the primary &quot;vahana&quot; (mount) and the principal &quot;gana&quot; (follower) of Shiva. Nandi figures depicted as a seated bull are present at Shiva temples throughout the world.

==== Coinage ====

The humpbacked Zebu bull (&quot;bos indicus&quot;) appears on the coinage of the Indian subcontinent from the Iron Age to the modern day. Bull symbols appear regularly on silver &quot;karshapana&quot;, or punchmarked coins, first issued by the Janapada kingdoms, and continued by the Magadhan and Mauryan empires. In additional to the bull, many karshapana contain taurine symbols of the mark left by the bulls hoof, also referred to as a &quot;nandipada&quot; (Nandi&#x27;s foot) symbol which appears in Vedic, Hindu, Jain and Iranic iconography.

Kushan empire (c.30-275 CE) coins and those of the Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom (230-365) depict the Iranian god &quot;Wēś&quot; beside a bull, sometimes holding a trident and beside a Nandipada symbol.
The silver &quot;bull and horseman&quot; &quot;Jital&quot; of the Kabul or Hindu Shahi (850-1000) depicts a recumbent bull with a &quot;trishula&quot; on rump and the Nāgarī script legend above: &quot;Sri Samanta Deva (Radiant Samanta the God). This design was copied by later Rajput dynasties including the Tomaras of Delhi, the Chauhan dynasty and the Rathore dynasty on copper and billon (alloy) coins.

Upon independence from colonial rule, the bull reappeared in modern coins of the Indian rupee on the reverse of the 2 Anna coin in 1950.

==== Meitei mythology ====

Kao (bull), a supernatural divine bull, appears in ancient Meitei mythology and folklore of Ancient Manipur (Kangleipak).
In the legend of the Khamba Thoibi epic, Nongban Kongyamba, a nobleman of ancient Moirang realm, pretended to be an oracle and falsely prophesied that the people of Moirang would lead to miserable lives, if the powerful Kao (bull) roaming freely in the Khuman kingdom, wasn&#x27;t offered to the god Thangjing (), the presiding deity of Moirang. Orphan Khuman prince Khamba was chosen to capture the bull, as he was known for his valor and faithfulness. Since to capture the bull without killing it was not an easy task, Khamba&#x27;s motherly sister Khamnu disclosed to Khamba the secrets of the bull, by means of which the animal could be captured.

=== Cyprus ===
In Cyprus, bull masks made from real skulls were worn in rites. Bull-masked terracotta figurines and Neolithic bull-horned stone altars have been found in Cyprus.

=== Levant ===
Bull figurines are common finds on archaeological sites across the Levant; two examples are the 16th century BCE (Middle Bronze Age) bull calf from Ashkelon, and the 12th century BCE (Iron Age I) bull found at the so-called Bull Site in Samaria on the West Bank.
Both Baʿal and El were associated with the bull in Ugaritic texts, as it symbolized both strength and fertility.

Exodus reads &quot;He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, &#x27;This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt&#x27;.&quot;

Nehemiah reads &quot;even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, &#x27;This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!&#x27; They committed terrible blasphemies.&quot;

Calf-idols are referred to later in the Tanakh, such as in the Book of Hosea, which would seem accurate as they were a fixture of near-eastern cultures.

Solomon&#x27;s &quot;Molten Sea&quot; basin stood on twelve brazen bulls.

Young bulls were set as frontier markers at Dan and Bethel, the frontiers of the Kingdom of Israel.

Much later, in Abrahamic religions, the bull motif became a bull demon or the &quot;horned devil&quot; in contrast and conflict to earlier traditions. The bull is familiar in Judeo-Christian cultures from the Biblical episode wherein an idol of the golden calf () is made by Aaron and worshipped by the Hebrews in the wilderness of the Sinai Peninsula (Book of Exodus). The text of the Hebrew Bible can be understood to refer to the idol as representing a separate god, or as representing Yahweh himself, perhaps through an association or religious syncretism with Egyptian or Levantine bull gods, rather than a new deity in itself.

=== Greece ===

Among the Twelve Olympians, Hera&#x27;s epithet &quot;Bo-opis&quot; is usually translated &quot;ox-eyed&quot; Hera, but the term could just as well apply if the goddess had the head of a cow, and thus the epithet reveals the presence of an earlier, though not necessarily more primitive, iconic view. (Heinrich Schlieman, 1976) Classical Greeks never otherwise referred to Hera simply as the cow, though her priestess Io was so literally a heifer that she was stung by a gadfly, and it was in the form of a heifer that Zeus coupled with her. Zeus took over the earlier roles, and, in the form of a bull that came forth from the sea, abducted the high-born Phoenician Europa and brought her, significantly, to Crete.

Dionysus was another god of resurrection who was strongly linked to the bull. In a worship hymn from Olympia, at a festival for Hera, Dionysus is also invited to come as a bull, &quot;with bull-foot raging.&quot; &quot;Quite frequently he is portrayed with bull horns, and in Kyzikos he has a tauromorphic image,&quot; Walter Burkert relates, and refers also to an archaic myth in which Dionysus is slaughtered as a bull calf and impiously eaten by the Titans.

For the Greeks, the bull was strongly linked to the Cretan Bull: Theseus of Athens had to capture the ancient sacred bull of Marathon (the &quot;Marathonian bull&quot;) before he faced the Minotaur (Greek for &quot;Bull of Minos&quot;), who the Greeks imagined as a man with the head of a bull at the center of the labyrinth. Minotaur was fabled to be born of the Queen and a bull, bringing the king to build the labyrinth to hide his family&#x27;s shame. Living in solitude made the boy wild and ferocious, unable to be tamed or beaten. Yet Walter Burkert&#x27;s constant warning is, &quot;It is hazardous to project Greek tradition directly into the Bronze Age.&quot; Only one Minoan image of a bull-headed man has been found, a tiny Minoan sealstone currently held in the Archaeological Museum of Chania.

In the Classical period of Greece, the bull and other animals identified with deities were separated as their &quot;agalma&quot;, a kind of heraldic show-piece that concretely signified their numinous presence.

=== Roman Empire ===
The religious practices of the Roman Empire of the 2nd to 4th centuries included the &quot;taurobolium&quot;, in which a bull was sacrificed for the well-being of the people and the state. Around the mid-2nd century, the practice became identified with the worship of Magna Mater, but was not previously associated only with that cult (&quot;cultus&quot;). Public taurobolia, enlisting the benevolence of Magna Mater on behalf of the emperor, became common in Italy and Gaul, Hispania and Africa. The last public taurobolium for which there is an inscription was carried out at Mactar in Numidia at the close of the 3rd century. It was performed in honor of the emperors Diocletian and Maximian.

Another Roman mystery cult in which a sacrificial bull played a role was that of the 1st–4th century Mithraic Mysteries. In the so-called &quot;tauroctony&quot; artwork of that cult (&quot;cultus&quot;), and which appears in all its temples, the god Mithras is seen to slay a sacrificial bull. Although there has been a great deal of speculation on the subject, the myth (i.e. the &quot;mystery&quot;, the understanding of which was the basis of the cult) that the scene was intended to represent remains unknown. Because the scene is accompanied by a great number of astrological allusions, the bull is generally assumed to represent the constellation of Taurus. The basic elements of the tauroctony scene were originally associated with Nike, the Greek goddess of victory.

Macrobius lists the bull as an animal sacred to the god Neto/Neito, possibly being sacrifices to the deity.

=== Celts ===
Tarvos Trigaranus (the &quot;bull with three cranes&quot;) is pictured on ancient Gaulish reliefs alongside images of gods, such as in the cathedrals at Trier and at Notre Dame de Paris. In Irish mythology, the Donn Cuailnge and the Finnbhennach are prized bulls that play a central role in the epic &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (&quot;The Cattle Raid of Cooley&quot;). Early medieval Irish texts also mention the &quot;tarbfeis&quot; (bull feast), a shamanistic ritual in which a bull would be sacrificed and a seer would sleep in the bull&#x27;s hide to have a vision of the future king.

Pliny the Elder, writing in the first century AD, describes a religious ceremony in Gaul in which white-clad druids climbed a sacred oak, cut down the mistletoe growing on it, sacrificed two white bulls and used the mistletoe to cure infertility:
Bull sacrifices at the time of the Lughnasa festival were recorded as late as the 18th century at Cois Fharraige in Ireland (where they were offered to Crom Dubh) and at Loch Maree in Scotland (where they were offered to Saint Máel Ruba).

== Medieval and modern and other uses ==
The practice of bullfighting in the Iberian Peninsula and southern France are connected with the legends of Saturnin of Toulouse and his protégé in Pamplona, Fermin. These are inseparably linked to bull-sacrifices by the vivid manner of their martyrdoms set by Christian hagiography in the third century.

In some Christian traditions, Nativity scenes are carved or assembled at Christmas time. Many show a bull or an ox near the baby Jesus, lying in a manger. Traditional songs of Christmas often tell of the bull and the donkey warming the infant with their breath. This refers (or, at least, is referred) to the beginning of the book of the prophet Isaiah, where he says: &quot;The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master&#x27;s crib.&quot; (Isaiah 1:3)

Oxen are some of the animals sacrificed by Greek Orthodox believers in some villages of Greece.
It is specially associated to the feast of Saint Charalambos.
This practice of kourbania has been repeatedly criticized by church authorities.

The ox is the symbol of Luke the Evangelist.

Among the Visigoths, the oxen pulling the wagon with the corpse of Saint Emilian lead to the correct burial site (San Millán de la Cogolla, La Rioja).

Taurus (Latin for &quot;the Bull&quot;) is one of the constellations of the zodiac, which means it is crossed by the plane of the ecliptic. Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere&#x27;s winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the Early Bronze Age when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring equinox. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and Rome.

In his book &#x27;Robin Hood: Green Lord of the Wildwood&#x27; (2016),John Matthews interprets the scene from the ballad in which Sir Richard-at-Lee awards, for the love of Robin Hood, a prize of a white bull to the winner of a wrestling match as seeming &#x27;to hark back to an ancient time when the presentation of such a valuable, and probably sacred beast, would have represented an offering to the gods&#x27;. For Matthews, the Bull-running at Tutbury, mentioned in another Robin Hood ballad, may have had similar significance.

<text>Gérard Faier, known as Gérard Majax (April 28, 1943) is a French illusionist.

He has appeared in many television programs, magic demonstrations, and movies.

From 1987 until 2002 he, along with Jacques Théodor and Henri Broch of the Laboratoire de Zététique at the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis, oversaw the International Zetetic Challenge.

During the 1990s, on a late night television show by Thierry Ardisson Majax gave a demo of the &quot;rotating table&quot; &quot;supernatural phenomenon&quot;: a group of &quot;randomly&quot; selected people from the audience stood around a round table, put their hands on it, and the table went up and started rotating. Observation of a video recording made of this event showed that some participants had metal hacks hidden in the sleeves of their jackets. When the participants put the hands on the table, the hacks &quot;pinched&quot; the table underneath, allowing it to be lifted.

In 2000, he created The Hallucinoscope, a virtual reality system that works without electronics and gives the user the impression of walking above ground.

<text>Vanport, sometimes referred to as Vanport City or Kaiserville, was a city of wartime public housing in Multnomah County, Oregon, United States, between the contemporary Portland city boundary and the Columbia River. It was destroyed in the 1948 Columbia River flood and not rebuilt. It sat on what is currently the site of Delta Park and the Portland International Raceway.

==History==
Vanport construction began in August 1942 to house the workers at the wartime Kaiser Shipyards in Portland and Vancouver, Washington. Vanport—a portmanteau of &quot;Vancouver&quot; and &quot;Portland&quot;—was home to 40,000 people, about 40 percent of them African-American, making it Oregon&#x27;s second-largest city at the time, and the largest public housing project in the nation. After the war, Vanport lost more than half of its population, dropping to 18,500, as many wartime workers left the area. However, there was also an influx of returning World War II veterans. In order to attract veterans and their families, the Housing Authority of Portland (HAP) opened a college named the Vanport Extension Center; the school would eventually be renamed Portland State University.

Vanport was dramatically destroyed at 4:05 p.m. on May 30, 1948, when a section of a railroad berm holding back the Columbia River collapsed during a flood, killing 15 people. The city was underwater by nightfall, leaving around 18,000 of its inhabitants homeless.

===Inhabitants===
The city was a hub of transient laborers from all corners of the country; few residents had any long-term connections with each other and little opportunity or interest to build them. The temporary nature of the new city contributed to an overall sense of insecurity and anxiety among residents. The lack of businesses and recreation opportunities contributed to a sense of distrust, and the relative isolation of the largely male workforce meant there was little demand for community institutions such as a newspaper or high school.

By 1943–44, families living in Vanport were moving out at the rate of 100 a day. A questionnaire mailed to 1,000 former Vanport families, selected randomly from the approximately 3,000 families who had left by then, asked, among other things, why they had moved to Vanport in the first place. About 230 people answered this question. The top reason given for choosing the Portland–Vancouver shipyards was that &quot;they thought it their duty to go into defense work&quot;. The second-ranked reason was a desire for a better job, and the third, higher wages. However, the situation changed when the war ended in 1945. The Housing Authority of Portland (HAP) then sought to attract World War II veterans who needed housing, a community to raise their families, and higher education through the Servicemen&#x27;s Readjustment Act (G.I. Bill). The establishment of a college at Vanport in 1946 was a key part of the strategy to keep Vanport a thriving Oregon community.

===Race relations===
The establishment of Vanport coincided with an unprecedented influx of African-Americans into Oregon, attracted to work in newly federally-desegregated wartime defence industries. Due to exclusionary racial laws, the state had a population of fewer than 1,800 Black people in 1940; by 1946 more than 15,000 lived in the Portland area, mostly in Vanport and other segregated housing districts. One prewar observer, Portland Urban League secretary Edwin C. Berry, described Portland as a &quot; &#x27;northern&#x27; city with a &#x27;southern&#x27; exposure&quot;, arguing that the city shared with southern cities &quot;traditions, attitudes, and things interracial in character.&quot; Berry argued that prior to the war the city exhibited remarkably unprogressive racial attitudes.

The hastily constructed wartime development&#x27;s social and cultural mores had little in common with Portland as a whole. Vanport&#x27;s immigrants imported their particular brands of racism from throughout the country. White migrants from the South were the most vocal in opposing the degree of integration that HAP dictated for schools, buses and work sites. The Authority was largely unsympathetic to these complaints and at no time was &quot;de jure&quot; segregation imposed on any of Vanport&#x27;s facilities. When police were called because Black men were dancing with white women at a local event, only the white women were detained and warned that their conduct might lead to a race riot.

HAP never had any explicit policy advocating segregation; nonetheless, for various reasons de facto segregation was the norm. Whites complained when placed near &quot;Black&quot; areas, and segregation of Vanport by neighborhood might as well have been enforced legally. Only in 1944 were complaints raised about the segregation situation in the city. Reacting to the criticism—and pressure from Eleanor Roosevelt—by April 1944, HAP began placing incoming Black people into the &quot;white&quot; areas of the settlement. However, word quickly spread and 63 white residents quickly signed a petition demanding a reversal of the policy. Entire buildings were free in the &quot;Black&quot; areas of town, they argued, and after opponents of the integration plan appeared at a HAP meeting the authority decided to resume its previous policies.

The unprecedented level of integration and lack of any major incidents of racially-motivated violence or severe tensions did not mean there were no problems. Tensions between Black and white communities were still a part of Vanport life as well as a problem in relating to Portland. A 1943–44 study published in the &quot;American Sociological Review&quot; indicates that the top five complaints from Vanport residents included &quot;negroes and whites in same neighborhood&quot;, &quot;negroes and whites in same school&quot;, and &quot;discrimination against Vanport people by Portlanders&quot;.

Although some of Portland&#x27;s Black people lived in 53 of the city&#x27;s 60 census tracts before the war, about half were concentrated in two tracts east of the Willamette River and north of the east–west centerline of the city. After the war, much of Portland&#x27;s Black community remained centered in northeastern parts of the city.

The 1948 Vanport Flood parallels the 2007Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans. In both cases, public officials led the population to believe that the damage would be slight, and in both cases the government response to the disaster was harshly criticized. Critics attributed the poor response, in both cases, to racist attitudes on the part of officials, who pointedly neglected to respond appropriately to the destruction of a community that had a relatively large number of Black residents. However, many dispute the role of racism, pointing to the transformation of Vanport by the influx of World War II veterans and their families and official commitment to the area shown by the establishment at Vanport of the only state college in the greater Portland metropolitan area. At the time of the flood, one-third of Vanport residents were Black.

===Flood===
Vanport was especially vulnerable to flooding, since it was built on reclaimed lowlands along the Columbia River. The Columbia Basin is a massive area encompassing seven U.S. states as well as British Columbia. The previous winter snowpack was 75 to 135% of normal. Above normal temperatures accompanied two major rainstorms May 19 to 23, 1948, and again May 26 to 29. In the days prior to the flood, rainfall combined with meltwater swelled the many tributaries that feed the Columbia River, creating high water levels that had not been seen since the record flood of 1894. The lowest point in Vanport was about below the water level in the river.

A radio alert was issued the night before the flood, and some residents moved their belongings into attics and upper floors. Few imagined the possible extent to which the water levels would rise. Another contributing factor to the lack of voluntary evacuation was the fact that many residents relied solely on public transportation.

On the morning of Memorial Day, May 30, 1948, the Housing Authority of Portland issued the following statement: &quot;Remember: Dikes are safe at present. You will be warned if necessary. You will have time to leave. Don&#x27;t get excited.&quot;
At about 4:17 p.m. the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway berm burst, sending a wall of water into the area of Vanport College. According to a historical marker, the break happened at an old railroad cut that had been filled in. Because of the numerous sloughs and backwaters in the area, the progress of the flood was delayed about 30 minutes, giving residents more time to escape.

An emergency siren began to sound shortly after the initial breach, and residents began to head up North Denver Avenue to higher ground.

At the time of the flood, the population of Vanport was down to about 18,500 people. Because of the holiday, many residents were away from their homes for the day. These factors contributed to the low loss of life: officially, there were only 15 deaths. Nonetheless, the city was a complete loss.

On June 11, 1948, President Harry S. Truman flew to Portland to examine the damage. The recovery effort was assisted by Vanport College and the Red Cross.

===Legacy===

Vanport led Portland and Oregon in integrating Black people. &quot;The first black teachers and policemen in the state were hired in Vanport during the war years&quot;. One of those Black teachers, Martha Jordan, later became the first Black teacher hired by Portland Public Schools.

Vanport&#x27;s destruction eased the integration of a large African-American population into North and Northeast Portland. Indeed, some Black leaders argued that the flood was ultimately beneficial for the city&#x27;s Black community. Vanport, argued National Urban League director Lester Granger, was a &quot;nasty, segregated ghetto&quot; where &quot;negroes lived in the same patterns as they did in the South.&quot; The flood that wiped out the district, he continued, was a benefit in that it allowed Black people to further integrate into Portland&#x27;s society.

To prevent future incidents, Congress enacted the Flood Control Act of 1950 which spawned projects such as the Priest Rapids Dam. The flood also resulted in the 1961 Columbia River Treaty and later the construction of Libby Dam in Montana.

The loss of Vanport is considered a factor in the eventual closing of the Jantzen Beach Amusement Park on Hayden Island in 1970. Several acres of the former city became &quot;West Delta Park&quot; which is now the Portland International Raceway. The Vanport Extension Center refused to close after the flood disaster and quickly reopened in downtown Portland. Dubbed by a national magazine &quot;The College that Wouldn&#x27;t Die,&quot; it became present-day Portland State University.

Beginning in 2016, the Vanport Mosaic Festival has been held annually to commemorate the city and its history.

<text>My Life Without Me is a 2003 Canadian drama film directed by Isabel Coixet and starring Sarah Polley, Mark Ruffalo, Scott Speedman, and Leonor Watling. Based on the 1997 short story collection &quot;Pretending the Bed Is a Raft&quot; by Nanci Kincaid, it tells a story of a 23-year-old woman, with a husband and two daughters, who finds out she is going to die soon. The film is an El Deseo and My Life Productions co-production.

==Plot==
Ann is a hard-working 23-year-old mother with two young daughters, an unemployed husband, a mother who sees her life as a failure, and a jailed father whom she has not seen for ten years. Her life changes dramatically when, during a medical checkup following a collapse, she is diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer and told that she has only two months to live.

Deciding not to tell anyone of her condition and using the cover of anemia, Ann makes a list of things to do before she dies. She decides to change her hair, record birthday messages for the girls for every year until they&#x27;re 18, and tries to set up her husband with another woman.

Feeling a longing to experience a life that was never available to her, she seeks out a man to experience how it feels to be in a sexual relationship with someone other than her husband. Her experiment ends up taking an emotional toll when she meets with a man named Lee, who ends up madly in love with her and is left heartbroken when Ann breaks it off with him. He meets with her one last time and says that he will do anything to make her happy, taking care of her daughters and even finding her husband a new job. She ends their relationship and never tells him that she is dying.

At the end of the film, Ann records a message to her husband, telling him that she loves him, and another one to Lee, telling him the same. She then leaves all tapes that she has recorded with her doctor, asking him to deliver them after her death.

<text>Kunado-no-Kami (), alternately Kunato-no-Kami, Funado-no-Kami, Funato-no-Kami, or Chimata-no-Kami, are Japanese local gods connected chiefly with protection against disaster and malicious spirits.

The term &quot;Kunado-no-Kami&quot; and its variants are derived ultimately from &quot;ku-na-do&quot;, meaning a place that is not to be entered, a taboo or sacred space. These kami are regarded as protecting the boundaries of a village and forestalling entry by malicious or harmful spirits and influences, thereby preventing disasters. A common origin myth connects them with the fundoshi cast aside by Izanagi upon his return from the underworld as recorded in the Kojiki.

In some cases the protection of these kami extends to roads and paths, in which capacity the variant name Chimata-no-Kami is particularly likely to be applied.

<text>&quot;God Save Ireland&quot; is an Irish rebel song celebrating the Manchester Martyrs, three Fenians executed in 1867. It served as an unofficial anthem for Irish nationalists from the 1870s to the 1910s.

==Composition==
On 18 September 1867, a group of 20–30 men effected the escape of two Fenian prisoners by ambushing the carriage transporting them to Belle Vue Gaol in Manchester. An attempt to shoot the lock off the carriage door caused the death of a police guard. In the following weeks, 28 men were arrested, 26 sent for trial, and five tried on 29 October. None had fired the fatal shot; all were charged with murder under the common purpose and felony murder doctrines. One of the five, Edward O&#x27;Meagher Condon, concluded his speech from the dock with the words &quot;God Save Ireland&quot;, a motto taken up by supporters in the public gallery. All five were convicted and sentenced to death, again responding &quot;God Save Ireland&quot;. One was acquitted on appeal as the evidence was shown to be unreliable; although the others were convicted on the evidence of the same witnesses, their sentences stood, though Condon&#x27;s was commuted. The other three, Michael Larkin, William Phillip Allen, and Michael O&#x27;Brien, were hanged on 23 November 1867 and dubbed the Manchester Martyrs, not merely by physical force Irish republicans but more generally by Irish nationalists who felt a miscarriage of justice had occurred.

The phrase &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; was quickly repeated by campaigners for their pardon and, after their hanging, by organisers of commemorations. The lyrics to &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; written by Timothy Daniel Sullivan were first published on 7 December 1867, the day before the Martyrs&#x27; funeral. Two other songs with the same title had been published before Sullivan&#x27;s. To hasten his song&#x27;s adoption, Sullivan set it to the well-known tune of &quot;Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!&quot;, a popular pro-Union song of the American Civil War. The lines &quot;whether on the scaffold high / Or on battlefield we die&quot; were similar to lines from &quot;The Place where Man should Die&quot;, by Michael Joseph Barry, published in 1843 in &quot;The Nation&quot;.

==Nationalist anthem==
In the late 19th and early 20th century, &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; was habitually sung at gatherings of Irish nationalists, both in Ireland and abroad; it was considered the anthem of the Home Rule movement, in particular the Irish Parliamentary Party, coming to be described as the &quot;Irish national anthem&quot;. During the Parnellite split of the 1890s, &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; was the anthem of the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation. John McCormack, an Irish tenor residing in the United States, had a big hit with the number, making the first of his popular phonograph records of it in 1906.

The song was sung by the insurgents during the Easter Rising of 1916, but thereafter it fell out of favour. The heavily wounded Cathal Brugha who was presumed dead was discovered by Commandant Éamonn Ceannt singing the song with his pistol still in hand. Just as the Irish Parliamentary Party and the green harp flag were eclipsed by Sinn Féin and the Irish tricolour, so &quot;God Save Ireland&quot; was eclipsed by &quot;The Soldiers&#x27; Song&quot;, which was formally adopted in 1926 as the anthem of the Irish Free State created in 1922.

==In sport==
The song was sung at football matches by fans of Celtic F.C. and the Republic of Ireland team. The melody of the chorus was adapted for &quot;Ally&#x27;s Tartan Army&quot;, the Scotland national football team&#x27;s anthem for the FIFA World Cup 1978, this was itself adapted as the chorus of &quot;Put &#x27;Em Under Pressure&quot;, the anthem for the Republic of Ireland team for the FIFA World Cup 1990.

==Lyrics==
&lt;poem&gt;
High upon the gallows tree swung the noble-hearted three.
By the vengeful tyrant stricken in their bloom;
But they met him face to face, with the courage of their race,
And they went with souls undaunted to their doom.

Chorus:
&quot;God save Ireland!&quot; said the heroes;
&quot;God save Ireland&quot; said they all.
Whether on the scaffold high
Or the battlefield we die,
Oh, what matter when for Erin dear we fall!

Girt around with cruel foes, still their courage proudly rose,
For they thought of hearts that loved them far and near;
Of the millions true and brave o&#x27;er the ocean&#x27;s swelling wave,
And the friends in holy Ireland ever dear.

(Chorus)

Climbed they up the rugged stair, rang their voices out in prayer,
Then with England&#x27;s fatal cord around them cast,
Close beside the gallows tree kissed like brothers lovingly,
True to home and faith and freedom to the last.

(Chorus)

Never till the latest day shall the memory pass away,
Of the gallant lives thus given for our land;
But on the cause must go, amidst joy and weal and woe,
Till we make our Isle a nation free and grand.

(Chorus)
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="574214" wikidata="Q2860128" url="?curid=574214" title="Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America">
<text>The Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America (AOCANA), often referred to in North America as simply the Antiochian Archdiocese, is the jurisdiction of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch in the United States and Canada. Originally under the care of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Syro-Levantine Eastern Orthodox Christian immigrants to the United States and Canada were granted their own jurisdiction under the Church of Antioch in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution. Internal conflicts divided the Antiochian Orthodox faithful into two parallel archdiocesesthose of New York and Toledountil 1975, when Metropolitan Philip (Saliba) became the sole archbishop of the reunited Antiochian Archdiocese. By 2014, the archdiocese had grown to over 275 parish churches.

It is one of three Orthodox Christian jurisdictions in North America to currently practice the liturgical Western Rite as well as the Byzantine Rite, along with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia and the Orthodox Church in America.

==History==
The Antiochian Orthodox followers were originally cared for by the Russian Orthodox Church in America and the first bishop consecrated in North America, Raphael of Brooklyn, was consecrated by the Russian Orthodox Church in America in 1904 to care for the Syro-Levantine Greek Orthodox Christian Ottoman immigrants to the United States and Canada, who had come chiefly from the vilayets of Adana, Aleppo, Damascus, and Beirut (the birthplace of the community&#x27;s founder, Raphael of Brooklyn).

After the Bolshevik Revolution threw the Russian Orthodox Church and its faithful abroad into chaos, the Syro-Levantine Greek Orthodox Christian faithful in North America, simultaneously shaken by the death of their beloved bishop, Raphael, chose to come under the direct care of the Damascus-based Patriarchate of Antioch. Due to internal conflicts, however, the Antiochian Orthodox faithful in North America became divided between two archdioceses, those of New York City and Toledo.

In 1975, the two Antiochian Orthodox archdioceses were united as one Archdiocese of North America (now with its headquarters in Englewood, New Jersey). Since then, it has experienced significant growth through ongoing evangelization of North Americans and the immigration of Orthodox Christian Arabs from the Middle East. Its leader from 1966 until 2014 was Metropolitan Philip Saliba. Six other diocesan bishops assisted the metropolitan in caring for the archdiocese, which is the third largest Orthodox Christian jurisdiction in North America, with 74,600 adherents in the United States, 27,300 of whom are regular church attendees. As of 2011, it also has 249 parishes in the United States with two monastic communities.

Metropolitan Philip died in 2014 and was succeeded by Metropolitan Joseph Al-Zehlaoui. Metropolitan Joseph retired in 2022 following allegations of sexual misconduct.

The archdiocese is a participating member of the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America. Metropolitan Joseph served as the body&#x27;s first vice chairman.

==Structure==
The archdiocese is divided in eight territorial dioceses and one vicariate. Some of the territorial dioceses extend into Canada.

* Charleston, Oakland, and the Mid-Atlantic (chancery in Charleston, West Virginia)
* Los Angeles and the West (chancery in Los Angeles, California)
* Miami and the Southeast (also referred to as DOMSE) (chancery in Coral Gables, Florida)
* New York and Washington, D.C. (chancery in Englewood, New Jersey)
* Ottawa, Eastern Canada and Upstate New York (chancery in Montreal, Canada)
* Toledo and the Midwest (chancery in Toledo, Ohio)
* Wichita and Mid-America (chancery in Wichita, Kansas)
* Worcester and New England (chancery in Worcester, Massachusetts).

Alongside the eight Byzantine Rite territorial dioceses exists the Western Rite Vicariate, a non-territorial vicariate created from remnants of the Society of Saint Basil in 1961, three years after the Western Rite was approved for use by the archdiocese in 1958. It oversees all Antiochian parishes serving the Roman or Anglican uses of the Western Rite, as opposed to the Byzantine Rite used by the majority of the archdiocese.

==Evangelism==

Many conservative former Anglicans have turned to the archdiocese as a jurisdiction, some joining and leading Western Rite parishes with liturgy more familiar to Western Christians. The current mission of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America is to &quot;bring Orthodoxy to America&quot;. Its Department of Missions and Evangelism was chaired by Peter Gillquist who led the mass conversion of the Evangelical Orthodox Church to Eastern Orthodoxy. Gillquist died in . The current chairman is John Finley.

The archdiocese also includes Ancient Faith Ministries among its departments, with its well-known Ancient Faith Radio division, an Internet-based radio station with content themed around Orthodox Christianity, including both streaming stations and more than 100 podcasts.

As a result of its evangelism and missionary work, the Antiochian Archdiocese saw significant growth between the mid-1960s and . The archdiocese had only 65 parishes across the United States in the mid-1960s and, by , this number had increased to 249 parishes.

===Relations with other Christian bodies===
The archdiocese was a member of the National Council of Churches (NCC) for decades, but its archdiocesan convention voted unanimously on 28 July 2005 to withdraw fully from that body.

==Episcopacy and Diocesan Oversight==

While American converts play a substantial role in the life of the archdiocese, being well represented among both clergy and laity, all current bishops of the Antiochian Archdiocese are of Levantine descent, though that hasn&#x27;t always been the case.

In addition to the bishops, three of the dioceses are currently overseen by archimandrites on behalf of Met Saba, until the election of more bishops

<doc id="574216" wikidata="Q564226" url="?curid=574216" title="Lennart Bernadotte">
<text>Prince Lennart Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg (born Prince Lennart of Sweden, Duke of Småland; 8 May 1909 – 21 December 2004) was a Swedish-German landscaper, filmmaker, photographer and was a grandson of King Gustaf V of Sweden. He was also the eldest great-great-grandchild of King Christian IX.

He was born at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, to Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland, and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia. At birth Bernadotte was a Swedish prince and was titled Duke of Småland. In 1932, he married Karin Nissvandt, an unequal marriage, and thereafter ceased to be a Swedish dynast. Thus, he was called &quot;Mr.&quot; Bernadotte as a result. Nineteen years after he lost his Swedish royal titles, he was given titles of nobility in Luxembourg.

He published two memoirs: &quot;Käre prins, godnatt&quot; (1977) and &quot;Mainau min medelpunkt&quot; (1995).

==Title==
Under the Swedish Act of Succession, a prince or princess marrying without the consent of the monarch and government forfeits the right of succession for themselves and their descendants. In a new policy adopted in the case of Lennart Bernadotte, they were also forbidden to use their titles and told to use the surname of Bernadotte. By his marriage on 11 March 1932 Prince Lennart consequently, as far as Swedish records were concerned, was to be called &quot;Mr. Lennart Bernadotte&quot;.

He considered himself for several decades subjected to very cruel treatment from the Royal Court of Sweden due to his first marriage, and his wife developed a worsening psychosis from it which eventually led to their divorce in 1971.

Beginning in 1892, Swedish princes who lost their succession rights received noble titles conferred by other reigning monarchs. On 2 July 1951, for himself, his wife and his marital descendants, Bernadotte was admitted by Grand Duchess Charlotte (head of state at the time) into the nobility of Luxembourg as Count of Wisborg and in that conferral was also called &quot;Gustaf Lennart Nicolas Paul Prince Bernadotte&quot;.
Counts of Wisborg are considered to be part of the Swedish unintroduced nobility.

It has been reported (without accuracy) that Lennart and his cousin Sigvard Bernadotte wanted King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden to restore their royal titles, which he could have done, but that he chose not to do so; no such request was actually ever made however.

==Career==
In 1944 Bernadotte portrayed the young Crown Prince Carl of Sweden and Norway in the historical film &quot;Prince Gustaf&quot;, Bernadotte&#x27;s only screen acting role. He served as head of the Sveriges Scoutförbund (Scouting Association of Sweden) from 1948 to 1951

Lennart Bernadotte concentrated his energy on his estate on the island of Mainau in Lake Constance, Germany, where he died, and on his charitable fund, the &quot;Lennart Bernadotte Stiftung&quot;. He was considered a major gardening and landscaping talent and expert and turned his island into a popular tourist attraction.

He inspired the Green Charter of Mainau, which then became the template for the International Ski Federation&#x27;s Mainau Forums and Mainau Manifesto&#x27;s and the sports commitment to the environment and climate change.

He received the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation in 1996.

==Family==
In London on 11 March 1932 Bernadotte married firstly Karin Emma Louise Nissvandt (7 July 1911 – 9 September 1991). They had four children before divorcing in December 1971: Birgitta (1933), Marie-Louise (1935-1988), Jan (1941-2021), and Cecilia (1944-2024).

In Mainau on 29 April 1972 Bernadotte married Sonja Anita Maria Haunz (7 May 1944 – 21 October 2008). They had five children: Bettina (1974), Björn (1975), Catherine (1977), Christian (1979), and Diana (1982).

Bernadotte died in 2004. His remains, and four years later those of his second wife, were interred in a crypt under the palace chapel on Mainau. His first wife&#x27;s remains were buried in his father&#x27;s grave in Flen.

<doc id="574223" wikidata="Q668115" url="?curid=574223" title="TNM staging system">
<text>The TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (TNM) is a globally recognised standard for classifying the anatomical extent of the spread of malignant tumours (cancer). It has gained wide international acceptance for many solid tumor cancers, but is not applicable to leukaemia or tumors of the central nervous system. Most common tumors have their own TNM classification. The TNM staging system is sometimes referred to as the AJCC/UICC staging system or the UICC/AJCC staging system. Several revisions have been published, the latest being the eighth edition in 2017.

TNM was developed and is maintained by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). It is also used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). In 1987, the UICC and AJCC staging systems were unified into the single TNM staging system. TNM is a notation system that describes the stage of a cancer, which originates from a solid tumor, using alphanumeric codes:

*T describes the size of the original (primary) tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, 
*N describes nearby (regional) lymph nodes that are involved,
*M describes distant metastasis (spread of cancer from one part of the body to another).

The TNM staging system for all solid tumors was devised by Pierre Denoix of the Institut Gustave Roussy between 1943 and 1952, using the size and extension of the primary tumor, its lymphatic involvement, and the presence of metastases to classify the progression of cancer.

==General outline==
The TNM classification comprises staging algorithms for almost all cancers, with the primary exception of pediatric cancers. The general outline for the TNM classification is below. The values in parentheses give a range of what can be used for all cancer types, but not all cancers use this full range.

===Mandatory parameters===

* T: size or direct extent of the primary tumor
** Tx: tumor cannot be assessed
** Tis: carcinoma in situ
** T0: no evidence of tumor
** T1, T2, T3, T4: size and/or extension of the primary tumor
* N: degree of spread to regional lymph nodes
** Nx: lymph nodes cannot be assessed
** N0: no regional lymph nodes metastasis
** N1: regional lymph node metastasis present; at some sites, tumor spread to closest or small number of regional lymph nodes
** N2: tumor spread to an extent between N1 and N3 (N2 is not used at all sites)
** N3: tumor spread to more distant or numerous regional lymph nodes (N3 is not used at all sites)
* M: presence of distant metastasis
** M0: no distant metastasis
** M1: metastasis to distant organs (beyond regional lymph nodes)

The Mx designation was removed from the 7th edition of the AJCC/UICC system, but referred to cancers that could not be evaluated for distant metastasis.

===Other parameters===
* G (1–4): the &quot;grade&quot; of the cancer cells (i.e. they are &quot;low grade&quot; if they appear similar to normal cells, and &quot;high grade&quot; if they appear poorly differentiated)
* S (0–3): elevation of serum tumor markers
* R (0–2): the completeness of the operation (&quot;resection&quot;-boundaries free of cancer cells or not)
* Pn (0–1): invasion into adjunct nerves
* L (0–1): invasion into lymphatic vessels
* V (0–2): invasion into vein (no, microscopic, macroscopic)
* C (1–5): a modifier of the certainty (quality) of the last mentioned parameter (has been removed in the TNM 8th edition)

===Prefix modifiers===
* c: stage is determined from evidence acquired before treatment (including clinical examination, imaging, endoscopy, biopsy, surgical exploration). The c-prefix is implicit in absence of the p-prefix.
* p: stage given by histopathologic examination of a surgical specimen
* y: stage assessed after chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy; in other words, the individual had neoadjuvant therapy.
* r: stage for a recurrent tumor in an individual that had some period of time free from the disease.
* a: stage determined at autopsy.
* u: stage determined by ultrasonography or endosonography. Clinicians often use this modifier although it is not an officially defined one
* m: tumor is multifocal (more than 1 tumors). The opposite, s, can be used when there is particular reason to emphasize that the tumor is solitary/single.

For the T, N and M parameters exist subclassifications for some cancer-types (e.g. T1a, Tis, N1i)

===UICC Stage and AJCC Prognostic Stage Groups===
The TNM system is used to record the anatomical extent of disease. It is useful to condense these categories into groups. Carcinoma in situ is categorized stage 0; often tumors localized to the organ of origin are staged as I or II depending on the extent, locally extensive spread, to regional nodes are staged as III, and those with distant metastasis staged as stage IV. However, in some tumor types stage groups do not conform to this simplified schema. The stage group is adopted with the intention that categories within each group are more or less homogeneous in respect of survival, and that the survival rates are distinctive between groups.
The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) uses the term &quot;Stage&quot; to define the anatomical extent of disease. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) uses the term &quot;Prognostic Stage Group&quot; which may also include additional prognostic factors in addition to anatomical extent of disease.

==Examples==
* Small, low-grade cancer, no metastasis, no spread to regional lymph nodes, cancer completely removed, resection material seen by pathologist: pT1 pN0 M0 R0 G1; this grouping of T, N, and M would be considered Stage I.
* Large, high grade cancer, with spread to regional lymph nodes and other organs, not completely removed, seen by pathologist: pT4 pN2 M1 R1 G3; this grouping of T, N, and M would be considered Stage IV.

While most Stage I tumors are curable, most Stage IV tumors are inoperable.

==Uses and aims==
Some of the aims for adopting a global standard are to:
* Aid medical staff in staging the tumor helping to plan the treatment.
* Give an indication of prognosis.
* Assist in the evaluation of the results of treatment.
* Enable facilities around the world to collate information more productively.

Since the number of combinations of categories is high, combinations are grouped to stages for better analysis.

==Versions==
The criteria used in the TNM system have varied over time, sometimes fairly substantially, according to the different editions that AJCC and UICC have released. The dates of publication and adoption for use of the UICC and AJCC editions are summarized here; past editions are available from AJCC for web download.

UICC editions:
* 
* 
* Went into effect 2003.
* Went into effect 2010.
* Went into effect 2017.

AJCC editions:
* Went into effect 1978.
* Went into effect 1984.
* Went into effect 1989.
* Went into effect 1993.
* Went into effect 1998.
* Went into effect 2003.
* Went into effect 2010.
* Delayed to go into effect 2018.

As a result, a given stage may have quite a different prognosis depending on which staging edition is used, independent of any changes in diagnostic methods or treatments, an effect that has been termed &quot;stage migration&quot;. The technologies used to assign patients to particular categories have also changed, and increasingly sensitive methods tend to cause individual cancers to be reassigned to higher stages, making it improper to compare that cancer&#x27;s prognosis to the historical expectations for that stage. A further important consideration is the effect of improving treatments over time.

==Essential TNM==
Essential TNM is a simplified form of TNM designed specifically to enable cancer registries in low and middle income countries to collect stage information when complete details of the extent of disease are not available for collection by the registry. It is not designed to replace TNM for patient care.

<doc id="574228" wikidata="Q650938" url="?curid=574228" title="McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II">
<text>The General Dynamics/McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II was a proposed American attack aircraft from General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas. It was to be an all-weather, carrier-based stealth bomber replacement for the Grumman A-6 Intruder in the United States Navy and Marine Corps. Its &quot;Avenger II&quot; name was taken from the Grumman TBF Avenger of World War II.

The development of the A-12 was troubled by cost overruns and several delays, causing questions of the program&#x27;s ability to deliver upon its objectives; these doubts led to the development program&#x27;s cancellation in 1991. The manner of its cancellation was contested through litigation until a settlement was reached in January 2014.

==Design and development==
===Advanced Tactical Aircraft program===
The United States Navy began the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program in 1983. The program was to develop and field a replacement for the A-6 Intruder by 1994. Stealth technology developed for the United States Air Force would be used heavily in the program. Concept design contracts were awarded to the industry teams of McDonnell Douglas/General Dynamics, and Northrop/Grumman/Vought in November 1984. The teams were awarded contracts for further concept development in 1986.

The General Dynamics/McDonnell Douglas team was selected as the winner on 13 January 1988; the rival team led by Grumman surprisingly failed to submit a final bid. The General Dynamics/McDonnell Douglas team was awarded a development contract and the ATA aircraft was designated &quot;A-12&quot;. The first flight was initially planned for December 1990. The A-12 was named &quot;Avenger II&quot; in homage to the World War II-era Navy torpedo-bomber Grumman TBF Avenger.

The Navy initially sought to buy 620 A-12s and Marines wanted 238. In addition, the Air Force briefly considered ordering some 400 of an A-12 derivative. The A-12 was promoted as a possible replacement for the Air Force&#x27;s General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, and for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Panavia Tornado fighter-bombers. The craft was a flying wing design in the shape of an isosceles triangle, with the cockpit situated near the apex of the triangle. The A-12 gained the nickname &quot;Flying Dorito&quot;.

The aircraft was to be powered by two General Electric F412-D5F2 turbofan engines, each producing about of thrust. It was designed to carry precision guided weapons internally, up to two AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missiles, two AGM-88 HARM air-to-ground missiles and a complement of air-to-ground ordnance, including unguided or precision-guided bombs, could be carried in an internal weapons bay. It has been claimed that the A-12 was to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons held in its internal weapons bay as well. The A-12 was to have a weapons load of .

Beginning in early 1990 General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas revealed delays and projected cost increases. Due to late requirement changes to the aircraft impacting the composite design, aircraft weight had increased to 30% over design specification. This was unwelcome for an airplane that needed to operate efficiently and effectively from an aircraft carrier. Technical difficulties with the complexity of the radar system to be used also caused costs to increase; by one estimate the A-12 was to consume up to 70% of the Navy&#x27;s budget for aircraft. After delays, its critical design review was successfully completed in October 1990 and the maiden flight was rescheduled to early 1992. In December 1990 plans were made for 14 Navy aircraft carriers to be equipped with a wing of 20 A-12s each.

A government report released in November 1990 documented serious problems with the A-12 development program. In December 1990 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the Navy to justify the program and deliver reasons why it should not be canceled. The response given by the Navy and the contractors failed to persuade the Secretary of Defense, as he canceled the program in the following month, on 7 January 1991, for breach of contract.

The government felt the contractors could not complete the program and instructed them to repay most of the $2 billion that had been spent on A-12 development. McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics disputed this in Federal Claims court. The reasons and causes for the cancellation have been debated and have been an issue of controversy.

===Aftermath===

After the cancellation of the A-12, the Navy elected to purchase the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which went on to replace the A-6 Intruder and the F-14 Tomcat. The Super Hornet uses the General Electric F414 turbofan engine, which is a modified variant of the upgraded F404 version developed for the A-12. The full-size A-12 mockup was revealed to the public at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in June 1996. The cancellation of the A-12 is seen as one of the major losses in the 1990s that weakened McDonnell Douglas and led to its merger with rival Boeing in 1997. After years of being in storage at the Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (formerly General Dynamics) facility in Fort Worth, Texas, the mockup was transported to Veterans Memorial Air Park adjacent to Meacham Airport in north Fort Worth in June 2013. (The park was later renamed Fort Worth Aviation Museum.)

The manner in which the program was canceled led to years of litigation between the contractors and the Department of Defense over breach of contract (General Dynamics Corp. v. United States). On 1 June 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the U.S. Navy was justified in canceling the contract. The ruling also required the two contractors to repay the U.S. government US$1.35 billion, plus interest charges of US$1.45 billion. Boeing, which had merged with McDonnell Douglas, and General Dynamics vowed to appeal the ruling. In September 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court said it would hear the two companies&#x27; arguments, that the government canceled the project improperly and that the use of the state secrets privilege by the U.S. prevented them from mounting an effective defense. In May 2011, the Supreme Court set aside the Appeals Court decision and returned the case to federal circuit court. In January 2014, the case was settled with Boeing and General Dynamics agreeing to pay $200 million each to the U.S. Navy.

<text>This article presents a list of military occupations, both historic and contemporary, but only those that have taken place since the customary laws of belligerent military occupation were first clarified and supplemented by the Hague Convention of 1907.

As currently understood in international law, &quot;military occupation&quot; is the effective military control by a power of a territory outside of said power&#x27;s recognized sovereign territory. The occupying power in question may be an individual state or a supranational organization, such as the United Nations.

<doc id="574249" wikidata="Q611642" url="?curid=574249" title="Yasu, Shiga">
<text>is a city located in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 50,695 in 20695 households and a population density of 630 persons per km2. The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Yasu is located in south-central Shiga Prefecture, on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa. The city skyline is dominated by Mount Mikami, also known as &quot;Ōmi Fuji&quot; from its resemblance to Mount Fuji. Parts of the city are within the borders of the Mikami-Tanakami-Shigaraki Prefectural Natural Park.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Shiga Prefecture
*Konan
*Moriyama
*Ōmihachiman
*Rittō
*Ryūō

===Climate===
Yasu has a Humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Yasu is 14.5 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1430 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.3 °C, and lowest in January, at around 3.1 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Yasu doubled from 1960 to 2000 and has plateaued since then.

== History ==
Yasu is part of ancient Ōmi Province and the route of the Tōsandō (later the Nakasendō) highway connecting Heian-kyō with the eastern provinces passed through the area; however, there were no &quot;shukuba&quot; within the city limits. Most of the area was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate in the Edo period. The minor feudal domain of Mikami Domain controlled by a cadet branch of the Endo clan had its &quot;jin&#x27;ya&quot; in Yasu, but its estates were widely scattered in other locations, mostly in Izumi province. The town of Yasu was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Yasu annexed the village of Mikami in 1942, and the villages of Shinohara and Gio in 1955, On October 1, 2004, Yasu absorbed the neighboring town of Chūzu (also from Yasu District) and was elevated to city status. Yasu District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

Mount Mikami (三上山), standing at an elevation of 432 meters, is affectionately known as &quot;Omi Fuji (近江富士),&quot; as referenced by Murasaki Shikibu (紫式部) in her poem: &quot;Upon setting forth, I gaze upon Mikami&#x27;s mountain; though snowless (打ち出でて　三上の山を　詠れば　雪こそなけれ　富士のあけぼの), it rivals Fuji at dawn.&quot; Historically cherished, this mountain is also known as &quot;Mukade-yama&quot; due to the legend of the giant centipede slain by Fujiwara Hidesato (Tawara Toda). It holds a storied past with mentions in the Kojiki and Engishiki, and has been celebrated in waka poetry. Matsuo Basho also composed a verse about it: &quot;In Mikami&#x27;s summer, its form is well known (三上山のみ夏知れる姿かな).&quot;

The Mikami Shrine, situated at the mountain&#x27;s base, venerates Mount Mikami as a sacred mountain. According to shrine tradition, on the 18th day of the 6th month in the 6th year of Emperor Kōrei&#x27;s reign, the deity Amanomikage-no-mikoto descended upon the summit, and the shrine priest (Mikami no Hafuri) enshrined the mountain as a divine body (Kannabi). Archaeological excavations from the Meiji to Showa periods uncovered 24 bronze bells at the foot of Mount Mikami, suggesting that rituals have been conducted in the area since ancient times.

==Government==

<doc id="574269" wikidata="Q1208020" url="?curid=574269" title="Hino, Shiga">
<text>is a town located in Gamō District, Shiga Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 21,149 in 8467 households and a population density of 180 persons per km2. The total area of the town is .

==Geography==
Hino is located in east-central Shiga Prefecture in a large isolated rural area nestled beside the Suzuka Mountains with the town&#x27;s tallest peak being Mt. Watamuki (1110m). 
===Surrounding municipalities===
Shiga Prefecture
*Higashiōmi
*Kōka

===Climate===
Hino has a Humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Hino is 13.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1673 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.9 °C, and lowest in January, at around 1.6 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hino has remained relatively steady over the past 60 years.

==History==
The area of Hino was part of ancient Ōmi Province. The name &quot;Hino&quot; appears in Heian period documents in connection with handicraft made from thin strips of wood called &quot;Hinomono&quot;, which remain a local speciality. During the Muromachi period, the area was dominated by the Gamō clan who ruled from Hino Castle, and it was also the origin of many traveling merchants, known as &quot;Ōmi shonin&quot;. During the Edo period, much of the town was part of the domain of Nisshōji Domain, a 20,000 &quot;koku&quot; holding under the Tokugawa shogunate. With the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889, the town of Hino was established. Hino expanded by annexing the neighboring villages of Higashi-Sakuradani, Nishi-Sakuradani, Nishioji, Kaige, Minamihizusa, and Kitahizusa on March 16, 1955 .

==Government==
Hino has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 14 members. Hino, together with the town of Ryūō contributes one member to the Shiga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Shiga 4th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Agriculture has dominated the local economy since ancient times. Manufacturing includes a number of pharmaceutical factories, including Hino Pharmaceutical Company.

==Education==

Hino has six public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the town government, and one public high school operated by the Shiga Prefectural Board of Education.

==Transportation==
Rural Hino offers less options for public transportation than most areas in Shiga. The private Ohmi Railway company services the one and only train station in Hino, Hino Station, with trains running on average twice every hour, with slightly more frequency during common commuting times and with less during mid afternoon. However, the station was built roughly 3 km away from the town center. Bicycles can be rented near the station and can be taken on and off the Ohmi Train during certain times. The Ohmi Train offers a &quot;Free Ticket&quot; which allows a rider to get on and off anywhere along the train line for the whole day at one set price on weekends and holidays.

Ohmi Railway also runs buses which pick up and drop off at multiple points throughout Hino. The main bus connects Kitabata-guchi, Hino Station, and Ōmi-Hachiman Station as well as many rural points in between. The bus takes about 50 minutes from Hino to Ōmihachiman. Smaller inner-town buses also operate, but taking into consideration their infrequency, time and cost when compared to the overall size and points of interest of Hino, it is usually best to either walk, ride a bicycle or scooter, or drive a car if visiting multiple destinations.

==History==
===Pre-modern===
The area of Toyosato was part of ancient Ōmi Province and (after the Taika Reform) corresponds to Inukami District Achiki Township and Aichi District Yoshida Township.It is claimed that the area was settled during the Kofun period by immigrants from Baekje, centered on what is now the Achiki Shrine. From the Heian period, the area was divided between several shoen landed estates, and a number of settlements arose along the route of the Tōkaidō highway connecting Heian-kyō with the eastern provinces of Japan. The merchants in these villages formed guilds controlling the transport of Japanese paper, which was mostly made in Mino Province to Kyoto, Ise and Owari.  During the Nanboku-chō and into the Sengoku period, the area was hotly contested between the Kyōgoku clan and the Rokkaku clan, and many mount fortifications were constructed. During the Edo period, the entire area of the town was part of the holdings of Hikone Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. “ Ōmi merchants” were very active and prospered during this period, notably the Fujino family, which had trading posts in Ezo and who were active in local politics, and the Ito family, which founded the Marubeni and Itochu trading houses.

===Modern era===
The village of Toyosato was created on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. During the Meiji period the area suffered from repeated droughts, which led to the development of some of Japan&#x27;s first agricultural cooperatives and investment in groundwater irrigation. Toyosato annexed the neighboring village of Achi in 1956 and was elevated to town status on February 11, 1956.

==Government==
Toyosato has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 11 members. Toyosato, collectively with the other municipalities of Inukami District, contributes one member to the Shiga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Shiga 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Agriculture has dominated the local economy since ancient times. Manufacturing includes a number of small to medium-sized textile, chemicals, and metals processing factories.

==Education==

On February 14, 2005, Maihara, along with the towns of Ibuki and Santō (all from Sakata District), was merged to create the city of Maibara.

It has developed as a traffic junction. In Edo period, there were Samegai-juku and Banba-juku. During the Meiji period, a large train station opened in the town, but it was named Mai[[Maihara, Shiga|b]]ara, not Maihara (see rendaku). Many Japanese people confused the town&#x27;s name and the station&#x27;s name, to the point where eventually, Maibara was adopted as the official name of the new, merged city.

<text>The  (; &quot;National Unity Party&quot;), formerly the (; &quot;Christian Democracy Party of Quebec&quot;), was a social conservative political party in Quebec, Canada. It was founded in 2000 by Roman Catholics associated with the Centre d’Information nationale Robert Rumilly. The founding leader of the party was Gilles Noël. The party&#x27;s leader since 2010 has been Paul Biron, a retired engineer, whose brother, Rodrigue Biron, was leader of the conservative Union Nationale party from 1976 to 1980.

Its program was a combination of Christian orthodoxy and Quebec nationalism. The party is concerned about the declining birth rate in Quebec, opposed to same-sex marriage and abortion, wants more support for families, and wider availability of Quebec-made consumer products.

The Parti démocratie chrétienne du Québec&#x27;s 24 candidates won 3,575 votes in the April 2003 general election, or about 0.1% of the popular vote. It proposed to fight the aging of Quebec&#x27;s population by favouring the family through the creation of a family benefit of $430 per month per child under the age of 18. The party also proposed eliminating the $5/day universal child care program offered by the Government of Quebec at the time.

The party won 1,620 votes in the March 2007 general election, or about 0.04% of the popular vote.
On 29 June 2012, the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec approved the name of the party to be changed to &quot;Parti Unité Nationale&quot;.

<text>Unione Calcio Sampdoria, commonly referred to as Sampdoria (), is an Italian professional football club based in Genoa, Liguria. They compete in Serie B, the second division of the Italian football league system.

Sampdoria was formed in 1946 from the merger of two existing sports clubs whose roots can be traced back to the 1890s, Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria. Both the team name and colours reflect this union, the first being a combination of the names, the second taking the form of a unique kit design, predominantly blue (for Andrea Doria) with white, red and black bands (for Sampierdarenese) across the centre of the shirt, hence the nickname &quot;blucerchiati&quot; (&quot;blue-circled&quot;).

Sampdoria play at Stadio Luigi Ferraris, capacity 33,205, which they share with Genoa&#x27;s older club, Genoa Cricket and Football Club. The fierce rivalry between the two teams is commonly known as the &quot;Derby della Lanterna&quot;, and has been contested in Serie A for most of its history.

Sampdoria have won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; once in their history, in 1991. The club has also won the Coppa Italia four times, in 1985, 1988, 1989 and 1994, and the Supercoppa Italiana once, in 1991. Their biggest European success came when they won the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1990. They also reached the European Cup final in 1992, losing the final 1–0 to Barcelona after extra-time.

==History==
===Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria (1891–1927)===
 The roots of Sampdoria are to be found in two teams born in the late 1890s: Società Ginnastica Sampierdarenese and Società Andrea Doria. The former was founded in 1891 and opened its football section in 1899. The latter, named after Genoese admiral Andrea Doria, was founded in 1895.

Andrea Doria did not join the first Italian Football Championship organised by the Italian Federation of Football (FIF) and played on 8 May 1898. Instead, they played in the football tournament organised by the Italian Federation of Ginnastica. The first ancestor of Sampdoria to play in the Italian Football Championship was Sampierdarenese, who joined the third edition in 1900 for their only appearance before World War One.

Andrea Doria eventually joined the competition in 1902, but did not win a game until the 1907 edition, when they beat local rivals Genoa 3–1. It was not until 1910–11 that the club began to show promise, finishing above Juventus, Internazionale and Genoa in the main tournament.

After the war Sampierdarenese finally began to compete in the Italian Championship replacing another club from Bolzaneto, then an independent town in the province of Genoa, called Associazione del Calcio Ligure. Thus, during the 1919-20 edition Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria met in the championship for the first time. Doria won the first-leg game (4–1 and 1–1) and finished second after Genoa in the Liguria group, qualifying for the National Round.

Andrea Doria ended up first in the Liguria group above local rivals Genoa in the 1920-21 Championship.

For the 1921–22 season the Italian top league was split into two competitions, one run by the Italian Football Federation and a second one organised by the secessionist Italian Football Confederation. Sampierdarenese joined the IFF tournament, while Andrea Doria and Genoa signed up for the one organised by the Confederation. Sampierdarenese won the Liguria section and then went on to the semi-finals, finishing top out of three clubs and thus reaching the final against Novese. Both legs of the final ended in 0–0 draws, thus a repetition match was played in Cremona on 21 May 1922. The match went into extra time with Novese eventually winning the tie (and the Championship) 2–1.

By season 1924–25, Sampdoria&#x27;s ancestors were competing against each other in the Northern League; Andrea Doria finished one place above their rivals and won one match 2–1, while Sampierdarenese were victorious 2–0 in the other.

===From La Dominante to Sampdoria (1927–1946)===
A process of unification of the many professional football teams in Italy was started by the Fascist government. Particularly in 1927 multiple smaller clubs where merged into one all over the country. Among many other similar examples, four teams based in Rome merged and became AS Roma. Similarly, at the end of the 1926–27 season Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria merged for the first time under the name La Dominante.

Wearing green and black striped shirts, La Dominante Genova lived a short life, having played just three championships, and was not particularly successful. The team was admitted to the 1927-28 Divisione Nazionale Group B, ending the season in 10th place. The next season was the last year of Divisione Nazionale, and Dominante finished in 10th place. Finally, in 1929 Dominante competed in the first-ever Serie B tournament where they finished third, just missing out on promotion.

Dominante then absorbed the local team Corniglianese and competed in the 1930–31 Serie B under the name of Foot Ball Club Liguria. The team did not do well, finishing in 18th place and suffering relegation to Prima Divisione.

Both Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria reverted to their previous names in 1931 as separate clubs. In the span of just a few years Sampierdarenese then climbed up from Prima Divisione to Serie B and finally Serie A. Ending up second in the Girone D of the 1931–32 Prima Divisione, they got promoted to Serie B. After the uneventful 1932–33 Serie B season, the team proceeded to win the 1933–34 Serie B championship and were promoted into Serie A for the first time.

On 15 July 1937 Sampierdarenese absorbed Corniglianese and Rivarolese, with the club adopting the name Associazione Calcio Liguria. This saw them reach fifth place in Serie A in 1939. In the early 1940s, the club was relegated but bounced straight back up as Serie B champions in 1941.

After World War II, both Andrea Doria and Sampierdarenese (the name Liguria was abolished in 1945) were competing in Serie A, but in a reverse of pre-war situations, Andrea Doria were now the top club out of the two. However, on 12 August 1946, a merger occurred to create Unione Calcio Sampdoria.

The first chairman of this new club was Piero Sanguineti, but the ambitious entrepreneur Amedeo Rissotto soon replaced him, while the first team coach during this period was a man from Florence named Giuseppe Galluzzi. To illustrate the clubs would be equally represented in the new, merged club, a new kit was designed featuring the blue shirts of Andrea Doria and the white, red and black midsection of Sampierdarenese. In the same month of the merger, the new club demanded they should share the Stadio Luigi Ferraris ground with Genoa. An agreement was reached, and the stadium began hosting Genoa&#x27;s and Sampdoria&#x27;s home matches.

===Early years and the achievements in the Mantovani era (1946–1993)===
For about thirty years the Genoese played constantly in Serie A, with mixed results, the best of which was in the 1960–1961 season, in which they obtained fourth place in the championship. In the 1965–1966 season Sampdoria finished sixteenth, relegating to Serie B for the first time in its history; however, the following year they won the second-tier championship and immediately returned to Serie A.
In 1979, the club, then playing Serie B, was acquired by oil businessman Paolo Mantovani (1930–1993), who invested in the team to bring Sampdoria to the top flight. In 1982, Sampdoria made their Serie A return and won their first Coppa Italia in 1985. In 1986, Yugoslav Vujadin Boškov was appointed as the new head coach. The club won their second Coppa Italia in 1988, being admitted to the 1988–89 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they reached the final, losing 2–0 to Barcelona. A second consecutive triumph in the Coppa Italia gave Sampdoria a spot in the 1989–90 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, which they won after defeating Anderlecht after extra time in the final.

This was followed only one year later by their first and only &quot;Scudetto&quot;, being crowned as Serie A champions with a five-point advantage over second-placed Internazionale. The winning team featured several notable players, such as Gianluca Pagliuca, Gianluca Vialli, Roberto Mancini, Toninho Cerezo, Pietro Vierchowod and Attilio Lombardo, with Boškov as head coach. In the following season, Sampdoria reached the European Cup final and were defeated once again by Barcelona, at Wembley Stadium.

Vujadin Boškov is recognised as one of Sampdoria&#x27;s most successful managers winning a record amount of trophies and thus further establishing the club&#x27;s reputation in Europe.

===Decline, resurgence and decline again (1993–2023)===
On 14 October 1993, Paolo Mantovani died suddenly and was replaced by his son Enrico. During his first season (1993–94), Sampdoria won one more Coppa Italia and placed third in Serie A. During the following four seasons, many players from his father&#x27;s tenure left the club but many important acquisitions were made which kept Sampdoria in the top tier Serie A. This included the likes of Argentine internationals Juan Sebastián Verón and Ariel Ortega, and international midfielders Clarence Seedorf and Christian Karembeu. In April 1995 Sampdoria reached the semi-final stage of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, losing out to Arsenal on penalties after two legs.
In May 1999 Sampdoria were relegated from Serie A and did not return to the top flight until 2003. During this time, Sampdoria was acquired by Riccardo Garrone, an Italian oil businessman. Sampdoria returned to Serie A in 2003 led by talisman Francesco Flachi, and ended their first season in eighth place. After several more top-half finishes, manager Walter Novellino gave way to Walter Mazzarri in 2007.

With the signings of forwards Antonio Cassano from Real Madrid, and Giampaolo Pazzini in January 2008, Sampdoria ended the 2007–08 season in sixth position and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup. The following season, they came fourth and qualified for the UEFA Champions League play-offs under manager Luigi Delneri, who left for Juventus. With the departures also of CEO Giuseppe Marotta, and both Cassano and Pazzini, and the squad being stretched by Champions League football, Sampdoria were relegated to Serie B after a 2–1 loss at home to Palermo in May 2011. In the following season June 2012, Sampdoria won promotion back to Serie A after defeating Varese 4–2 on aggregate in the play-off final.

Following the death of Riccardo Garrone the previous year, the club was purchased from the Garrone family in June 2014 by the film producer . After sixth-placed rivals Genoa in the 2014–15 season failed to obtain a UEFA licence for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League, seventh-placed Sampdoria took their spot. The club built a solid foundation in Serie A for the next seven years. Notable managerial appointments were Marco Giampaolo and Claudio Ranieri, as well as the steady flow of goals from talismanic striker Fabio Quagliarella. Growing tensions however surrounded Ferrero&#x27;s presidency, fuelled by his well-known and public support of AS Roma. Several attempts were made to sell the club, including to a consortium led by club legend Gianluca Vialli. On 6 December 2021 Massimo Ferrero was arrested by Italian police as part of ongoing investigations into corporate crimes and bankruptcy. He resigned from his position as President of Sampdoria with immediate effect, whilst a club statement assured fans that the affairs of the football club were not a part of the investigations. On 27 December, former player Marco Lanna was appointed president. In January 2022 the club welcomed back former manager Marco Giampaolo after a disappointing start to the season under Roberto D&#x27;Aversa. On 6 February in his first home game back in charge, Sampdoria defeated Sassuolo 4–0. Results however began to dwindle, and after eight games and a winless start to the 2022–23 season the club parted company with Giampaolo. On 6 October former Serie A player legend Dejan Stanković was appointed to the role with the task of steering the club clear of the relegation zone. Sampdoria were later relegated in the 2022–23 season from Serie A to Serie B.

===A new chapter (2023–present)===
In late May 2023 former Leeds United owner Andrea Radrizzani and the businessman Matteo Manfredi reached an agreement with previous owner Massimo Ferrero to buy Sampdoria and prevent it from bankruptcy. On 27 June 2023, former Italy and Serie A legend Andrea Pirlo was appointed as the manager.

==Colours, badge and nicknames==

The white, blue, red and black colours represent the club&#x27;s origins with a merger between two teams, Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria, who wore respectively red/black and white/blue jerseys with a shield with Saint-George cross.

The club crest features a sailor in profile known by Genoese name of &quot;Baciccia&quot;, a diminutive of Ligurian &quot;Gio-Batta&quot;, Italian &quot;Giovanni Battista&quot;, i.e. John-Baptist. The image of a sailor is used due to Sampdoria being based in the port city of Genoa. The precise design of the Baciccia came from a Disney-licensed and Panini-published comic, &quot;Topolino&quot;, in 1980. Since 1980, the Baciccia has appeared on the shirts of Sampdoria, mostly on the chest but occasionally on the sleeve.

=== Kit manufacturers and sponsors ===
== Stadium ==
Since 1946, the club have played at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris, also known as the Marassi from the name of the neighbourhood where it is located, which has a capacity of 33,205. It is the ninth-largest stadium in Italy by capacity. The stadium is named after Luigi Ferraris (1887–1915), an Italian footballer, engineer and soldier who died during WWI.

The ground is shared with Sampdoria&#x27;s rivals, Genoa CFC The stadium was dismantled and rebuilt before the 1990 FIFA World Cup, for which it hosted three Group C matches (between Costa Rica, Scotland and Sweden) and a round-of-16 match between the Republic of Ireland and Romania.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Sampdoria supporters come mainly from the city of Genoa. The biggest group are Ultras Tito Cucchiaroni, named after an Argentinian left winger who played for Sampdoria. The group were founded in 1969, making it one of the oldest ultra groups in Italy. They are apolitical, although there are smaller groups like Rude Boys Sampdoria, who are left-wing, but today this group is no longer active. The main support with flags and flares comes from the southern Curva, Gradinata Sud.

Sampdoria&#x27;s biggest rivals are Genoa, against whom they play the &quot;Derby della Lanterna&quot;.

<text>The doomsday argument (DA), or Carter catastrophe, is a probabilistic argument that claims to predict the future population of the human species based on an estimation of the number of humans born to date. The doomsday argument was originally proposed by the astrophysicist Brandon Carter in 1983, leading to the initial name of the Carter catastrophe. The argument was subsequently championed by the philosopher John A. Leslie and has since been independently conceived by J. Richard Gott and Holger Bech Nielsen. Similar principles of eschatology were proposed earlier by Heinz von Foerster, among others. A more general form was given earlier in the Lindy effect, which proposes that for certain phenomena, the future life expectancy is proportional to (though not necessarily equal to) the current age and is based on a decreasing mortality rate over time.
==Summary==
The premise of the argument is as follows: suppose that the total number of human beings that will ever exist is fixed. If so, the likelihood of a randomly selected person existing at a particular time in history would be proportional to the total population at that time. Given this, the argument posits that a person alive today should adjust their expectations about the future of the human race because their existence provides information about the total number of humans that will ever live.

If the total number of humans who were born or will ever be born is denoted by formula_1, then the Copernican principle suggests that any one human is equally likely (along with the other formula_2 humans) to find themselves in any position formula_3 of the total population formula_1so humans assume that our fractional position formula_5 is uniformly distributed on the interval [0,1] before learning our absolute position.

formula_6 is uniformly distributed on (0,1) even after learning the absolute position formula_3. For example, there is a 95% chance that formula_6 is in the interval (0.05,1), that is formula_9. In other words, one can assume with 95% certainty that any individual human would be within the last 95% of all the humans ever to be born. If the absolute position formula_3 is known, this argument implies a 95% confidence upper bound for formula_1 obtained by rearranging formula_12 to give formula_13.

If Leslie&#x27;s figure is used, then approximately 60 billion humans have been born so far, so it can be estimated that there is a 95% chance that the total number of humans formula_1 will be less than 20formula_1560 billion = 1.2 trillion. Assuming that the world population stabilizes at 10 billion and a life expectancy of 80 years, it can be estimated that the remaining 1140 billion humans will be born in 9120 years. Depending on the projection of the world population in the forthcoming centuries, estimates may vary, but the argument states that it is unlikely that more than 1.2 trillion humans will ever live.

==Aspects==
Assume, for simplicity, that the total number of humans who will ever be born is 60 billion (&quot;N&quot;1), or 6,000 billion (&quot;N&quot;2). If there is no prior knowledge of the position that a currently living individual, &quot;X&quot;, has in the history of humanity, one may instead compute how many humans were born before &quot;X&quot;, and arrive at say 59,854,795,447, which would necessarily place &quot;X&quot; among the first 60 billion humans who have ever lived.

It is possible to sum the probabilities for each value of &quot;N&quot; and, therefore, to compute a statistical &#x27;confidence limit&#x27; on &quot;N&quot;. For example, taking the numbers above, it is 99% certain that &quot;N&quot; is smaller than 6 trillion.

Note that as remarked above, this argument assumes that the prior probability for &quot;N&quot; is flat, or 50% for &quot;N&quot;1 and 50% for &quot;N&quot;2 in the absence of any information about &quot;X&quot;. On the other hand, it is possible to conclude, given &quot;X&quot;, that &quot;N&quot;2 is more likely than &quot;N&quot;1 if a different prior is used for &quot;N&quot;. More precisely, Bayes&#x27; theorem tells us that P(&quot;N&quot;|&quot;X&quot;) = P(&quot;X&quot;|&quot;N&quot;)P(&quot;N&quot;)/P(&quot;X&quot;), and the conservative application of the Copernican principle tells us only how to calculate P(&quot;X&quot;|&quot;N&quot;). Taking P(&quot;X&quot;) to be flat, we still have to assume the prior probability P(&quot;N&quot;) that the total number of humans is &quot;N&quot;. If we conclude that &quot;N&quot;2 is much more likely than &quot;N&quot;1 (for example, because producing a larger population takes more time, increasing the chance that a low probability but cataclysmic natural event will take place in that time), then P(&quot;X&quot;|&quot;N&quot;) can become more heavily weighted towards the bigger value of &quot;N&quot;. A further, more detailed discussion, as well as relevant distributions P(&quot;N&quot;), are given below in the Rebuttals section.

The doomsday argument does &quot;not&quot; say that humanity cannot or will not exist indefinitely. It does not put any upper limit on the number of humans that will ever exist nor provide a date for when humanity will become extinct. An abbreviated form of the argument &quot;does&quot; make these claims, by confusing probability with certainty. However, the actual conclusion for the version used above is that there is a 95% &quot;chance&quot; of extinction within 9,120 years and a 5% chance that some humans will still be alive at the end of that period. (The precise numbers vary among specific doomsday arguments.)

==Variations==
This argument has generated a philosophical debate, and no consensus has yet emerged on its solution. The variants described below produce the DA by separate derivations.

===Gott&#x27;s formulation: &quot;vague prior&quot; total population===
Gott specifically proposes the functional form for the prior distribution of the number of people who will ever be born (&quot;N&quot;). Gott&#x27;s DA used the vague prior distribution:
:formula_16.
where
* P(N) is the probability prior to discovering &quot;n&quot;, the total number of humans who have &quot;yet&quot; been born.
* The constant, &quot;k&quot;, is chosen to normalize the sum of P(&quot;N&quot;). The value chosen is not important here, just the functional form (this is an improper prior, so no value of &quot;k&quot; gives a valid distribution, but Bayesian inference is still possible using it.)

Since Gott specifies the prior distribution of total humans, &quot;P(N)&quot;, Bayes&#x27; theorem and the principle of indifference alone give us &quot;P(N|n)&quot;, the probability of &quot;N&quot; humans being born if &quot;n&quot; is a random draw from &quot;N&quot;:

:formula_17

This is Bayes&#x27; theorem for the posterior probability of the total population ever born of &quot;N&quot;, conditioned on population born thus far of &quot;n&quot;. Now, using the indifference principle:

:formula_18.

The unconditioned &quot;n&quot; distribution of the current population is identical to the vague prior &quot;N&quot; probability density function, so:

:formula_19,

giving P (&quot;N&quot; | &quot;n&quot;) for each specific &quot;N&quot; (through a substitution into the posterior probability equation):

:formula_20.

The easiest way to produce the doomsday estimate with a given confidence (say 95%) is to pretend that &quot;N&quot; is a continuous variable (since it is very large) and integrate over the probability density from &quot;N&quot; = &quot;n&quot; to &quot;N&quot; = &quot;Z&quot;. (This will give a function for the probability that &quot;N&quot; ≤ &quot;Z&quot;):

:formula_21 formula_22

Defining &quot;Z&quot; = 20&quot;n&quot; gives:

:formula_23.

This is the simplest Bayesian derivation of the doomsday argument:
:The chance that the total number of humans that will ever be born (&quot;N&quot;) is greater than twenty times the total that have been is below 5%

The use of a vague prior distribution seems well-motivated as it assumes as little knowledge as possible about &quot;N&quot;, given that some particular function must be chosen. It is equivalent to the assumption that the probability density of one&#x27;s fractional position remains uniformly distributed even after learning of one&#x27;s absolute position (&quot;n&quot;).

Gott&#x27;s &quot;reference class&quot; in his original 1993 paper was not the number of births, but the number of years &quot;humans&quot; had existed as a species, which he put at 200,000. Also, Gott tried to give a 95% confidence interval between a &quot;minimum&quot; survival time and a maximum. Because of the 2.5% chance that he gives to underestimating the minimum, he has only a 2.5% chance of overestimating the maximum. This equates to 97.5% confidence that extinction occurs before the upper boundary of his confidence interval, which can be used in the integral above with &quot;Z&quot; = 40&quot;n&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; = 200,000 years:

:formula_24

This is how Gott produces a 97.5% confidence of extinction within &quot;N&quot; ≤ 8,000,000 years. The number he quoted was the likely time remaining, &quot;N&quot; − &quot;n&quot; = 7.8 million years. This was much higher than the temporal confidence bound produced by counting births, because it applied the principle of indifference to time. (Producing different estimates by sampling different parameters in the same hypothesis is Bertrand&#x27;s paradox.) Similarly, there is a 97.5% chance that the present lies in the first 97.5% of human history, so there is a 97.5% chance that the total lifespan of humanity will be at least

:formula_25;

In other words, Gott&#x27;s argument gives a 95% confidence that humans will go extinct between 5,100 and 7.8 million years in the future.

Gott has also tested this formulation against the Berlin Wall and Broadway and off-Broadway plays.

Leslie&#x27;s argument differs from Gott&#x27;s version in that he does not assume a&quot; vague prior&quot; probability distribution for &quot;N&quot;. Instead, he argues that the force of the doomsday argument resides purely in the increased probability of an early doomsday once you take into account your birth position, regardless of your prior probability distribution for &quot;N&quot;. He calls this the &quot;probability shift&quot;.

Heinz von Foerster argued that humanity&#x27;s abilities to construct societies, civilizations and technologies do not result in self-inhibition. Rather, societies&#x27; success varies directly with population size. Von Foerster found that this model fits some 25 data points from the birth of Jesus to 1958, with only 7% of the variance left unexplained. Several follow-up letters (1961, 1962, ...) were published in &quot;Science&quot; showing that von Foerster&#x27;s equation was still on track. The data continued to fit up until 1973. The most remarkable thing about von Foerster&#x27;s model was it predicted that the human population would reach infinity or a mathematical singularity, on Friday, November 13, 2026. In fact, von Foerster did not imply that the world population on that day could actually become infinite. The real implication was that the world population growth pattern followed for many centuries prior to 1960 was about to come to an end and be transformed into a radically different pattern. Note that this prediction began to be fulfilled just in a few years after the &quot;doomsday&quot; argument was published.

==Reference classes==
The reference class from which &quot;n&quot; is drawn, and of which &quot;N&quot; is the ultimate size, is a crucial point of contention in the doomsday argument argument. The &quot;standard&quot; doomsday argument hypothesis skips over this point entirely, merely stating that the reference class is the number of &quot;people&quot;. Given that you are human, the Copernican principle might be used to determine if you were born exceptionally early, however the term &quot;human&quot; has been heavily contested on practical and philosophical reasons. According to Nick Bostrom, consciousness is (part of) the discriminator between what is in and what is out of the reference class, and therefore extraterrestrial intelligence might have a significant impact on the calculation.

The following sub-sections relate to different suggested reference classes, each of which has had the standard doomsday argument applied to it.

===SSSA: Sampling from observer-moments===
Nick Bostrom, considering observation selection effects, has produced a Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA): &quot;that you should think of yourself as if you were a random observer from a suitable reference class&quot;. If the &quot;reference class&quot; is the set of humans to ever be born, this gives &quot;N&quot; &lt; 20&quot;n&quot; with 95% confidence (the standard doomsday argument). However, he has refined this idea to apply to &quot;observer-moments&quot; rather than just observers. He has formalized this as:

:The strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA): Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its reference class.

An application of the principle underlying SSSA (though this application is nowhere expressly articulated by Bostrom), is: If the minute in which you read this article is randomly selected from every minute in every human&#x27;s lifespan, then (with 95% confidence) this event has occurred after the first 5% of human observer-moments. If the mean lifespan in the future is twice the historic mean lifespan, this implies 95% confidence that &quot;N&quot; &lt; 10&quot;n&quot; (the average future human will account for twice the observer-moments of the average historic human). Therefore, the 95th percentile extinction-time estimate in this version is 4560 years.

==Rebuttals==
===We are in the earliest 5%, &quot;a priori&quot;===
One counterargument to the doomsday argument agrees with its statistical methods but disagrees with its extinction-time estimate. This position requires justifying why the observer cannot be assumed to be randomly selected from the set of all humans ever to be born, which implies that this set is not an appropriate reference class. By disagreeing with the doomsday argument, it implies that the observer is within the first 5% of humans to be born.

By analogy, if one is a member of 50,000 people in a collaborative project, the reasoning of the doomsday argument implies that there will never be more than a million members of that project, within a 95% confidence interval. However, if one&#x27;s characteristics are typical of an early adopter, rather than typical of an average member over the project&#x27;s lifespan, then it may not be reasonable to assume one has joined the project at a random point in its life. For instance, the mainstream of potential users will prefer to be involved when the project is nearly complete. However, if one were to enjoy the project&#x27;s incompleteness, it is already known that he or she is unusual, before the discovery of his or her early involvement.

If one has measurable attributes that set one apart from the typical long-run user, the project doomsday argument can be refuted based on the fact that one could expect to be within the first 5% of members, &quot;a priori&quot;. The analogy to the total-human-population form of the argument is that confidence in a prediction of the distribution of human characteristics that places modern and historic humans outside the mainstream implies that it is already known, before examining &quot;n&quot;, that it is likely to be very early in &quot;N&quot;. This is an argument for changing the reference class.

For example, if one is certain that 99% of humans who will ever live will be cyborgs, but that only a negligible fraction of humans who have been born to date are cyborgs, one could be equally certain that at least one hundred times as many people remain to be born as have been.

Robin Hanson&#x27;s paper sums up these criticisms of the doomsday argument:
===Human extinction is distant, &quot;a posteriori&quot;===
The a posteriori observation that extinction level events are rare could be offered as evidence that the doomsday argument&#x27;s predictions are implausible; typically, extinctions of dominant species happen less often than once in a million years. Therefore, it is argued that human extinction is unlikely within the next ten millennia. (Another probabilistic argument, drawing a different conclusion than the doomsday argument.)

In Bayesian terms, this response to the doomsday argument says that our knowledge of history (or ability to prevent disaster) produces a prior marginal for &quot;N&quot; with a minimum value in the trillions. If &quot;N&quot; is distributed uniformly from 1012 to 1013, for example, then the probability of &quot;N&quot; &lt; 1,200 billion inferred from &quot;n&quot; = 60 billion will be extremely small. This is an equally impeccable Bayesian calculation, rejecting the Copernican principle because we must be &#x27;special observers&#x27; since there is no likely mechanism for humanity to go extinct within the next hundred thousand years.

This response is accused of overlooking the technological threats to humanity&#x27;s survival, to which earlier life was not subject, and is specifically rejected by most academic critics of the doomsday argument (arguably excepting Robin Hanson).

===The prior &quot;N&quot; distribution may make &quot;n&quot; very uninformative===
Robin Hanson argues that &quot;N&quot; prior may be exponentially distributed:
:formula_26

Here, &quot;c&quot; and&quot; q&quot; are constants. If &quot;q&quot; is large, then our 95% confidence upper bound is on the uniform draw, not the exponential value of &quot;N&quot;.

The simplest way to compare this with Gott&#x27;s Bayesian argument is to flatten the distribution from the vague prior by having the probability fall off more slowly with &quot;N&quot; (than inverse proportionally). This corresponds to the idea that humanity&#x27;s growth may be exponential in time with doomsday having a vague prior probability density function in &quot;time&quot;. This would mean that &quot;N&quot;, the last birth, would have a distribution looking like the following:

:formula_27

This prior &quot;N&quot; distribution is all that is required (with the principle of indifference) to produce the inference of &quot;N&quot; from &quot;n&quot;, and this is done in an identical way to the standard case, as described by Gott (equivalent to formula_28 = 1 in this distribution):

:formula_29

Substituting into the posterior probability equation):

:formula_30

Integrating the probability of any &quot;N&quot; above &quot;xn&quot;:

:formula_31

For example, if &quot;x&quot; = 20, and formula_28 = 0.5, this becomes:

:formula_33

Therefore, with this prior, the chance of a trillion births is well over 20%, rather than the 5% chance given by the standard DA. If formula_28 is reduced further by assuming a flatter prior &quot;N&quot; distribution, then the limits on&quot; N&quot; given by &quot;n&quot; become weaker. An formula_28 of one reproduces Gott&#x27;s calculation with a birth reference class, and formula_28 around 0.5 could approximate his temporal confidence interval calculation (if the population were expanding exponentially). As formula_37 (gets smaller) &quot;n&quot; becomes less and less informative about &quot;N&quot;. In the limit this distribution approaches an (unbounded) uniform distribution, where all values of &quot;N&quot; are equally likely. This is Page et al.&#x27;s &quot;Assumption 3&quot;, which they find few reasons to reject, &quot;a priori&quot;. (Although all distributions with formula_38 are improper priors, this applies to Gott&#x27;s vague-prior distribution also, and they can all be converted to produce proper integrals by postulating a finite upper population limit.) Since the probability of reaching a population of size 2&quot;N&quot; is usually thought of as the chance of reaching &quot;N&quot; multiplied by the survival probability from &quot;N&quot; to 2&quot;N&quot; it follows that Pr(&quot;N&quot;) must be a monotonically decreasing function of &quot;N&quot;, but this doesn&#x27;t necessarily require an inverse proportionality.

===Infinite expectation===
Another objection to the doomsday argument is that the expected total human population is actually infinite. The calculation is as follows:

:The total human population N = n/f, where n is the human population to date and f is our fractional position in the total.
:We assume that f is uniformly distributed on (0,1].
: The expectation of N is formula_39

For a similar example of counterintuitive infinite expectations, see the St. Petersburg paradox.

===Self-indication assumption: The possibility of not existing at all===

One objection is that the possibility of a human existing at all depends on how many humans will ever exist (&quot;N&quot;). If this is a high number, then the possibility of their existing is higher than if only a few humans will ever exist. Since they do indeed exist, this is evidence that the number of humans that will ever exist is high.

This objection, originally by Dennis Dieks (1992), is now known by Nick Bostrom&#x27;s name for it: the &quot;Self-Indication Assumption objection&quot;. It can be shown that some SIAs prevent any inference of &quot;N&quot; from &quot;n&quot; (the current population).

===Caves&#x27; rebuttal===
The Bayesian argument by Carlton M. Caves states that the uniform distribution assumption is incompatible with the Copernican principle, not a consequence of it.

Caves gives a number of examples to argue that Gott&#x27;s rule is implausible. For instance, he says, imagine stumbling into a birthday party, about which you know nothing:

Your friendly enquiry about the age of the celebrant elicits the reply that she is celebrating her (&quot;t&quot;&quot;p&quot;=) 50th birthday. According to Gott, you can predict with 95% confidence that the woman will survive between [50]/39 = 1.28 years and 39[×50] = 1,950 years into the future. Since the wide range encompasses reasonable expectations regarding the woman&#x27;s survival, it might not seem so bad, till one realizes that [Gott&#x27;s rule] predicts that with probability 1/2 the woman will survive beyond 100 years old and with probability 1/3 beyond 150. Few of us would want to bet on the woman&#x27;s survival using Gott&#x27;s rule. &quot;(See Caves&#x27; online paper below.)&quot;

Although this example exposes a weakness in J. Richard Gott&#x27;s &quot;Copernicus method&quot; DA (that he does not specify when the &quot;Copernicus method&quot; can be applied) it is not precisely analogous with the modern DA; epistemological refinements of Gott&#x27;s argument by philosophers such as Nick Bostrom specify that:
: Knowing the absolute birth rank (&quot;n&quot;) must give no information on the total population (&quot;N&quot;).

Careful DA variants specified with this rule aren&#x27;t shown implausible by Caves&#x27; &quot;Old Lady&quot; example above, because the woman&#x27;s age is given prior to the estimate of her lifespan. Since human age gives an estimate of survival time (via actuarial tables) Caves&#x27; Birthday party age-estimate could not fall into the class of DA problems defined with this proviso.

To produce a comparable &quot;Birthday Party Example&quot; of the carefully specified Bayesian DA, we would need to completely exclude all prior knowledge of likely human life spans; in principle this could be done (e.g.: hypothetical Amnesia chamber). However, this would remove the modified example from everyday experience. To keep it in the everyday realm the lady&#x27;s age must be &quot;hidden&quot; prior to the survival estimate being made. (Although this is no longer exactly the DA, it is much more comparable to it.)

Without knowing the lady&#x27;s age, the DA reasoning produces a &quot;rule&quot; to convert the birthday (&quot;n&quot;) into a maximum lifespan with 50% confidence (&quot;N&quot;). Gott&#x27;s Copernicus method rule is simply: Prob (&quot;N&quot; &lt; 2&quot;n&quot;) = 50%. How accurate would this estimate turn out to be? Western demographics are now fairly uniform across ages, so a random birthday (&quot;n&quot;) could be (very roughly) approximated by a U(0,&quot;M&quot;] draw where &quot;M&quot; is the maximum lifespan in the census. In this &#x27;flat&#x27; model, everyone shares the same lifespan so &quot;N&quot; = &quot;M&quot;. If &quot;n&quot; happens to be less than (&quot;M&quot;)/2 then Gott&#x27;s 2&quot;n&quot; estimate of &quot;N&quot; will be under &quot;M&quot;, its true figure. The other half of the time 2&quot;n&quot; underestimates &quot;M&quot;, and in this case (the one Caves highlights in his example) the subject will die before the 2&quot;n&quot; estimate is reached. In this &quot;flat demographics&quot; model Gott&#x27;s 50% confidence figure is proven right 50% of the time.

===Self-referencing doomsday argument rebuttal===

Some philosophers have suggested that only people who have contemplated the doomsday argument (DA) belong in the reference class &quot;human&quot;. If that is the appropriate reference class, Carter defied his own prediction when he first described the argument (to the Royal Society). An attendant could have argued thus:

Presently, only one person in the world understands the Doomsday argument, so by its own logic there is a 95% chance that it is a minor problem which will only ever interest twenty people, and I should ignore it.

Jeff Dewynne and Professor Peter Landsberg suggested that this line of reasoning will create a paradox for the doomsday argument:

If a member of the Royal Society did pass such a comment, it would indicate that they understood the DA sufficiently well that in fact 2 people could be considered to understand it, and thus there would be a 5% chance that 40 or more people would actually be interested. Also, of course, ignoring something because you only expect a small number of people to be interested in it is extremely short sighted—if this approach were to be taken, nothing new would ever be explored, if we assume no &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge of the nature of interest and attentional mechanisms.

===Conflation of future duration with total duration===
Various authors have argued that the doomsday argument rests on an incorrect conflation of future duration with total duration. This occurs in the specification of the two time periods as &quot;doom soon&quot; and &quot;doom deferred&quot; which means that both periods are selected to occur &quot;after&quot; the observed value of the birth order. A rebuttal in Pisaturo (2009) argues that the doomsday argument relies on the equivalent of this equation:

:formula_40,
:where:
:&quot;X&quot; = the prior information;
:&quot;Dp&quot; = the data that past duration is &quot;tp&quot;;
:&quot;HFS&quot; = the hypothesis that the future duration of the phenomenon will be short;
:&quot;HFL&quot; = the hypothesis that the future duration of the phenomenon will be long;
:&quot;HTS&quot; = the hypothesis that the &quot;total&quot; duration of the phenomenon will be short—i.e., that &quot;tt&quot;, the phenomenon&#x27;s &quot;total&quot; longevity, = &quot;tTS&quot;;
: &quot;HTL&quot; = the hypothesis that the &quot;total&quot; duration of the phenomenon will be long—i.e., that &quot;tt&quot;, the phenomenon&#x27;s &quot;total&quot; longevity, = &quot;tTL&quot;, with &quot;tTL&quot; &gt; &quot;tTS&quot;.
Pisaturo then observes:

:Clearly, this is an invalid application of Bayes&#x27; theorem, as it conflates future duration and total duration.

Pisaturo takes numerical examples based on two possible corrections to this equation: considering only future durations and considering only total durations. In both cases, he concludes that the doomsday argument&#x27;s claim, that there is a &quot;Bayesian shift&quot; in favor of the shorter future duration, is fallacious.

This argument is also echoed in O&#x27;Neill (2014). In this work O&#x27;Neill argues that a unidirectional &quot;Bayesian Shift&quot; is an impossibility within the standard formulation of probability theory and is contradictory to the rules of probability. As with Pisaturo, he argues that the doomsday argument conflates future duration with total duration by specification of doom times that occur after the observed birth order. According to O&#x27;Neill:

:The reason for the hostility to the doomsday argument and its assertion of a &quot;Bayesian shift&quot; is that many people who are familiar with probability theory are implicitly aware of the absurdity of the claim that one can have an automatic unidirectional shift in beliefs regardless of the actual outcome that is observed. This is an example of the &quot;reasoning to a foregone conclusion&quot; that arises in certain kinds of failures of an underlying inferential mechanism. An examination of the inference problem used in the argument shows that this suspicion is indeed correct, and the doomsday argument is invalid. (pp. 216-217)

===Confusion over the meaning of confidence intervals===
Gelman and Robert assert that the doomsday argument confuses frequentist confidence intervals with Bayesian credible intervals. Suppose that every individual knows their number &quot;n&quot; and uses it to estimate an upper bound on &quot;N&quot;. Every individual has a different estimate, and these estimates are constructed so that 95% of them contain the true value of &quot;N&quot; and the other 5% do not. This, say Gelman and Robert, is the defining property of a frequentist lower-tailed 95% confidence interval. But, they say, &quot;this does not mean that there is a 95% chance that any particular interval will contain the true value.&quot; That is, while 95% of the confidence intervals will contain the true value of &quot;N&quot;, this is not the same as &quot;N&quot; being contained in the confidence interval with 95% probability. The latter is a different property and is the defining characteristic of a Bayesian credible interval. Gelman and Robert conclude:

One of them is an infinitely lengthy afterlife; however, any hopes of it might seem destroyed by something like Brandon Carter&#x27;s &#x27;doomsday argument&#x27; against viewing ourselves as extremely early humans. The apparent difficulty might be overcome in two ways. First, if the world is non-deterministic then anything on the lines of the doomsday argument may prove unable to deliver a strongly pessimistic conclusion. Secondly, anything on those lines may break down when an infinite sequence of experiences is in question.

<text>Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals&#x27; Abuse of Science (UK: Intellectual Impostures), first published in French in 1997 as , is a book by physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont. As part of the so-called science wars, Sokal and Bricmont criticize postmodernism in academia for the misuse of scientific and mathematical concepts in postmodern writing.

The book was published in English in 1998, with revisions to the original French edition for greater relevance to debates in the English-speaking world. According to some reports, the response within the humanities was &quot;polarized&quot;; critics of Sokal and Bricmont charged that they lacked understanding of the writing they were scrutinizing. By contrast, responses from the scientific community were more supportive.

Similar to the subject matter of the book, Sokal is best known for his eponymous 1996 hoaxing affair, whereby he was able to get published a deliberately absurd article that he submitted to &quot;Social Text&quot;, a critical theory journal. The article itself is included in &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot; as an appendix.

==Summary==
&quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot; examines two related topics:

# the allegedly incompetent and pretentious usage of scientific concepts by a small group of influential philosophers and intellectuals; and
# the problems of cognitive relativism—the idea that &quot;modern science is nothing more than a &#x27;myth&#x27;, a &#x27;narration&#x27; or a &#x27;social construction&#x27; among many others&quot;—as found in the Strong programme in the sociology of science.

===Incorrect use of scientific concepts versus scientific metaphors===
The stated goal of the book is not to attack &quot;philosophy, the humanities or the social sciences in general&quot;, but rather &quot;to warn those who work in them (especially students) against some manifest cases of charlatanism.&quot; In particular, the authors aim to &quot;deconstruct&quot; the notion that some books and writers are difficult because they deal with profound and complicated ideas: &quot;If the texts seem incomprehensible, it is for the excellent reason that they mean precisely nothing.&quot;

Set out to show how numerous key intellectuals have used concepts from the physical sciences and mathematics incorrectly, the authors intentionally provide considerably lengthy extracts in order to avoid accusations of taking sentences out of context. Such extracts pull from such works as those of Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Paul Virilio, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, and Jean Baudrillard, who—in terms of the quantity of published works, invited presentations, and of citations received—were some of the leading academics of continental philosophy, critical theory, psychoanalysis, and/or the social sciences at the time of publication.

The book provides a chapter to each of the above-mentioned authors, &quot;the tip of the iceberg&quot; of a group of intellectual practices that can be described as &quot;mystification, deliberately obscure language, confused thinking and the misuse of scientific concepts.&quot; For example, Irigaray is criticised for asserting that E=mc2 is a &quot;sexed equation&quot; because &quot;it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us&quot;; and for asserting that fluid mechanics is unfairly neglected because it deals with &quot;feminine&quot; fluids in contrast to &quot;masculine&quot; rigid mechanics. Similarly, Lacan is criticized for drawing an analogy between topology and mental illness that, in Sokal and Bricmont&#x27;s view, is unsupported by any argument and is &quot;not just false: it is gibberish.&quot;

Sokal and Bricmont claim that they do not intend to analyze postmodernist thought in general. Rather, they aim to draw attention to the abuse of concepts from mathematics and physics, their areas of specialty. The authors define this abuse as any of the following behaviors:
* Using scientific or pseudoscientific terminology without bothering much about technical meanings.
* Importing concepts from the natural sciences into the humanities without justification for their use.
* Displaying superficial erudition by using technical terms where they are irrelevant, presumably to impress and intimidate non-specialist readers.
* Manipulating meaningless words and phrases.
* Self-assurance on topics far beyond the competence of the author and exploiting the prestige of science to give discourses a veneer of rigor.

===The postmodernist conception of science===

Sokal and Bricmont highlight the rising tide of what they call &quot;cognitive relativism&quot;, the belief that there are no objective truths but only local beliefs. They argue that this view is held by a number of people, including people who the authors label &quot;postmodernists&quot; and the Strong programme in the sociology of science, and that it is illogical, impractical, and dangerous. Their aim is &quot;not to criticize the left, but to help defend it from a trendy segment of itself.&quot; Quoting Michael Albert, [T]here is nothing truthful, wise, humane, or strategic about confusing hostility to injustice and oppression, which is leftist, with hostility to science and rationality, which is nonsense.

==Reception==
According to &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; editor Barbara Epstein, who was delighted by Sokal&#x27;s hoax, the response to the book within the humanities was bitterly divided, with some delighted and some enraged; in some reading groups, reaction was polarized between impassioned supporters and equally impassioned opponents of Sokal.

===Support===

Philosopher Thomas Nagel has supported Sokal and Bricmont, describing their book as consisting largely of &quot;extensive quotations of scientific gibberish from name-brand French intellectuals, together with eerily patient explanations of why it is gibberish,&quot; and agreeing that &quot;there does seem to be something about the Parisian scene that is particularly hospitable to reckless verbosity.&quot;

Several scientists have expressed similar sentiments. Richard Dawkins, in a review of this book, said regarding the discussion of Lacan:We do not need the mathematical expertise of Sokal and Bricmont to assure us that the author of this stuff is a fake. Perhaps he is genuine when he speaks of non-scientific subjects? But a philosopher who is caught equating the erectile organ to the square root of minus one has, for my money, blown his credentials when it comes to things that I &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; know anything about.Noam Chomsky called the book &quot;very important&quot;, and said that &quot;a lot of the so-called &#x27;left&#x27; criticism [of science] seems to be pure nonsense.&quot;

===Criticism===

Limiting her considerations to physics, science historian Mara Beller maintained that it was not entirely fair to blame contemporary postmodern philosophers for drawing nonsensical conclusions from quantum physics, since many such conclusions were drawn by some of the leading quantum physicists themselves, such as Bohr or Heisenberg when they ventured into philosophy.

====Regarding Lacan====
Bruce Fink offers a critique in his book &quot;Lacan to the Letter&quot;, in which he accuses Sokal and Bricmont of demanding that &quot;serious writing&quot; do nothing other than &quot;convey clear meanings&quot;. Fink asserts that some concepts which the authors consider arbitrary or meaningless do have roots in the history of linguistics, and that Lacan is explicitly using mathematical concepts in a metaphoric way, not claiming that his concepts are mathematically founded. He takes Sokal and Bricmont to task for elevating a disagreement with Lacan&#x27;s choice of writing styles to an attack on his thought, which, in Fink&#x27;s assessment, they fail to understand. Fink says that &quot;Lacan could easily assume that his faithful seminar public...would go to the library or the bookstore and &#x27;bone up&#x27; on at least some of his passing allusions.&quot;

Similar to Fink, a review by John Sturrock in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; accuses Sokal and Bricmont of &quot;linguistic reductionism&quot;, claiming that they misunderstood the genres and language uses of their intended quarries.

This point has been disputed by Arkady Plotnitsky (one of the authors mentioned by Sokal in his original hoax). Plotnitsky says that &quot;some of their claims concerning mathematical objects in question and specifically complex numbers are incorrect&quot;, specifically attacking their statement that complex numbers and irrational numbers &quot;have nothing to do with one another&quot;. Plotnitsky here defends Lacan&#x27;s view &quot;of imaginary numbers as an extension of the idea of rational numbers—both in the general conceptual sense, extending to its ancient mathematical and philosophical origins...and in the sense of modern algebra.&quot; The first of these two senses refers to the fact that the extension of real numbers to complex numbers mirrors the extension of rationals to reals, as Plotnitsky points out with a quote from Leibniz: &quot;From the irrationals are born the impossible or imaginary quantities whose nature is very strange but whose usefulness is not to be despised.&quot;

Plotnitsky nevertheless agrees with Sokal and Bricmont that the &quot;square root of −1&quot; which Lacan discusses (and for which Plotnitsky introduces the symbol formula_1) is not, in spite of its identical name, &quot;identical, directly linked, or even metaphorized via the mathematical square root of −1&quot;, and that the latter &quot;is &quot;not&quot; the erectile organ&quot;.

==== Regarding Irigaray ====
While Fink and Plotnitsky question Sokal and Bricmont&#x27;s right to say what definitions of scientific terms are correct, cultural theorists and literary critics Andrew Milner and Jeff Browitt acknowledge that right, seeing it as &quot;defend[ing] their disciplines against what they saw as a misappropriation of key terms and concepts&quot; by writers such as Jacques Lacan and Luce Irigaray. However, they point out that Irigaray might still be correct in asserting that is a &quot;masculinist&quot; equation, since &quot;the social genealogy of a proposition has no logical bearing on its truth value.&quot; In other words, gender factors may influence &quot;which&quot; of many possible scientific truths are discovered. They also suggest that, in criticising Irigaray, Sokal and Bricmont sometimes go beyond their area of expertise in the sciences and simply express a differing position on gender politics.

==== Derrida ====
In his response, first published in &quot;Le Monde&quot; as &quot;Sokal and Bricmont Aren&#x27;t Serious&quot;, Jacques Derrida writes that the Sokal hoax is rather &quot;sad&quot;, not only because Alan Sokal&#x27;s name is now linked primarily to a hoax rather than science, but also because the chance to reflect seriously on this issue has been ruined for a broad public forum that deserves better. Derrida reminds his readers that science and philosophy have long debated their likenesses and differences in the discipline of epistemology, but certainly not with such an emphasis on the nationality of the philosophers or scientists. He calls it ridiculous and weird that there are intensities of treatment by the scientists, in particular, that he was &quot;much less badly treated&quot;, when in fact he was the main target of the US press.

Derrida then proceeds to question the validity of their attacks against a few words he made in an off-the-cuff response during a conference that took place thirty years prior to their publication. He suggests there are plenty of scientists who have pointed out the difficulty of attacking his response. He also writes that there is no &quot;relativism&quot; or a critique of Reason and the Enlightenment in his works. He then writes of his hope that in the future this work is pursued more seriously and with dignity at the level of the issues involved.

<text>Kurt Magnus Atterberg (, 12 December 188715 February 1974) was a Swedish composer and engineer. He is best known for his symphonies, operas, and ballets.

==Biography==

Atterberg was born in Gothenburg. His father was Anders Johan Atterberg, engineer; his uncle was the chemist Albert Atterberg. His mother, Elvira Uddman, was the daughter of a famous male opera singer.

In 1902, Atterberg began learning the cello, having been inspired by a concert by the Brussels String Quartet, featuring a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet No. 8. Six years later he became a performer in the Stockholm Concert Society, now known as the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, as well as publishing his first completed work, the Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra, Op. 1. His String Quartet No. 1 in D major, Op. 2, soon followed.

While already studying electrical engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology, Atterberg also enrolled at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm in 1910 with a score of his Rhapsody and an incomplete version of his Symphony No. 1. There he studied composition and orchestration under the composer Andreas Hallén. He earned his engineering diploma a year later, as well as being awarded a State Music Fellowship. He made his conducting debut at a concert in Gothenburg in 1912, premiering his first symphony and the Concert Overture in A minor, Op. 4.

Although continuing to compose and conduct, Atterberg enjoyed a fulfilling career in several different organisations. He accepted a post at the Swedish Patent and Registration Office in 1912, going on to become a head of department in 1936 and working there until his retirement in 1968.

Possibly Atterberg&#x27;s greatest success was his triumph in the 1928 International Columbia Graphophone Competition, organized to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of Franz Schubert&#x27;s death. Eventually, his sixth symphony was chosen out of 500 submissions as the winning work, over Franz Schmidt&#x27;s 3rd symphony and Czeslaw Marek&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia brevis&quot;. It was performed all over the Western world in subsequent years, among others by Thomas Beecham and Arturo Toscanini.

Atterberg died on 15 February 1974 in Stockholm, aged 86, and was buried there in the Northern Cemetery.

== Alleged Ties to Nazi Germany ==
Both before and during the Nazi era, Atterberg collaborated with German composers and music organizations with the aim of strengthening Swedish-German musical relations. He sometimes conducted his own works with famous orchestras in Germany and several famous conductors also performed Atterberg&#x27;s symphonies. Atterberg never hesitated to pass on the German contacts he had made over the years to his Swedish colleagues or to work to have Swedish works performed in Germany. In this way, Albert Henneberg could collaborate with Fritz Tutenberg, whom Atterberg had known since a music festival in Kiel in 1926, and together with him write operas for the opera in Chemnitz. From 1935–1938, Atterberg was also general secretary of the Permanent Council for the International Co-operation of Composers (Ständiger Rat für die internationale Zusammenarbeit der Komponisten), founded by Richard Strauss.

There are anti-Semitic streaks in Atterberg&#x27;s correspondence and use of language, particularly evident in disputes with the composer Moses Pergament, a music critic for the &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot;. In a letter to Pergament in 1923, Atterberg writes: &quot;I could not have dreamed that you would launch yourself as a Swedish composer […] So far, you are a purely Jewish composer for the sake of principle - why not in name as well?&quot; The contradiction between the composers was rooted in their diametrically different artistic orientations and the fact that Atterberg was a leading personality in Swedish musical life and an advocate of the romantic national identity. Pergament on the other hand, belonged to a more modernist phalanx, together with Gösta Nystroem and Hilding Rosenberg.

After the end of World War II, Atterberg was accused of being a Nazi sympathizer. At his own request, an investigation was set up by the Royal Academy of Music. The investigation could neither confirm nor dismiss suspicions of Nazi sympathies. However, after the war, Atterberg seems to have been marginalized and ostracized by at least some of his fellow Swedish composers.

==Organizer and critic==
Atterberg co-founded the Society of Swedish Composers in 1918, alongside other prominent composers such as Ture Rangström, Wilhelm Stenhammar and Hugo Alfvén. Six years later he was elected president of the society, maintaining the position until 1947. At a similar time, he became president of the Svenska Tonsättares Internationella Musikbyrå, which he also helped to found, and of which his presidency lasted until 1943. Other jobs taken on by Atterberg included his work as a music critic for the &quot;Stockholms Tidningen&quot; from 1919 to 1957, and as secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music from 1940 to 1953.

==Musical style==
Atterberg composed in a romantic style that may be compared to that of the musicians of the Nordic nationalist current, in particular Edvard Grieg or Jean Sibelius. Other important influences include (according to himself) Brahms, Reger, and several Russian composers including Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov.

==Assessment==
Together with Ture Rangström, Atterberg must be considered a leading composer of the second generation of Swedish late romantics and thus continued the tradition founded by Wilhelm Peterson-Berger, Wilhelm Stenhammar and Hugo Alfvén. He was a proponent of the idea that romantic music should portray and strengthen national identity, while opponents defined the character of modern music as transnational and cosmopolitan. While his five operas have fallen into neglect, the nine symphonies (ten when including the 1953 &quot;Sinfonia per archi&quot;) are once again being heard more frequently, and have been recorded several times.

==Works==
Atterberg composed nine symphonies (or ten if the &quot;Symphony for Strings&quot;, Op. 53, is included). His Ninth Symphony (entitled &quot;Sinfonia Visionaria&quot;) was, like Beethoven&#x27;s, scored for orchestra and chorus with vocal soloists. His output also includes six concertante works (including his Rhapsody, Op. 1, and a cello concerto), nine orchestral suites, three string quartets, a &quot;Sonata in B minor&quot;, five operas and two ballets.

For the 100th anniversary of the death of Schubert in 1928, the Columbia Graphophone Company sponsored a worldwide symphony competition in which composers were to write a symphony completing, or inspired by, Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony. Atterberg entered his Symphony No. 6 in C major, Op. 31, and was awarded first prize, winning $10,000. The symphony, which was later known as the &quot;Dollar Symphony&quot;, was recorded by Sir Thomas Beecham. The symphony was performed by Arturo Toscanini in 1943, during an NBC Symphony Orchestra broadcast concert; Atterberg praised the performance upon hearing the recorded broadcast.

On February 22, 2005, CPO Records released a complete box set of recordings of Atterberg&#x27;s symphonies, as well as the symphonic poem &quot;Älven – Från Fjällen till Havet&quot; (&quot;The River – From the Mountains to the Sea&quot;). The recordings were performed by the NDR Radiophilharmonie, Hamburg, Radio-Sinfonie-Orchester Stuttgart and the Radio-Sinfonie-Orchester Frankfurt, all conducted by Finnish conductor . Between 2013 and 2016, a second complete set of symphonies, with added material, was recorded by the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Neeme Järvi and released on the Chandos label.

==Personal life==

Atterberg married twice, first Ella Peterson, a pianist, in 1915; they divorced eight years later. His second marriage was to Margareta Dalsjö in 1925, which lasted until her death in 1962.

<text>The Philadelphia Barrage were a professional field lacrosse team that are based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and member of Major League Lacrosse. They were the Bridgeport Barrage from 2001 to 2003 at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The team then relocated to Philadelphia from the 2004 season to the 2007 season when they became a traveling team for 2008. They ceased operations before the 2009 season due to the economic situation in the United States. The Philadelphia Barrage were resurrected for the 2020 season.

==Franchise history==

The team played in Bridgeport, Connecticut from the 2001 to the 2003 season and relocated to the Philadelphia suburb of Villanova in 2004. From their initial move to Philadelphia, for the 2004 season, through the 2006 season, they played at Villanova Stadium, which is located on the campus of Villanova University. They had previously played at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport where they hosted the inaugural Major League Lacrosse All Star Game in 2001. The Barrage made the playoffs for the first time in 2004 and won the Major League Lacrosse Championship over the Boston Cannons. The Barrage, after winning their 1st Eastern Conference Title, once again made the playoffs and won the Major League Lacrosse Championship in 2006 over the Denver Outlaws. For the 2007 season, the team moved to the United Sports Training Center in West Bradford Township, Pennsylvania. The Barrage, after winning their 2nd Eastern Conference Title, once again made the playoffs and won the Major League Lacrosse Championship in 2007 over the Los Angeles Riptide. The Barrage become the first team in MLL History to win back to back Steinfield Cup titles by winning the championship in 2006 and 2007.

After subsequent months of rumors, about the status and financial health of the franchise in 2007, Major League Lacrosse assumed operational control of the franchise in 2008. The Barrage played the full 2008 season as a travel team with their designated home games at league promotional sites outside of the Philadelphia area. The team folded before the 2009 season.

===2020: Revival===
On February 17, 2020, MLL announced it was bringing back the Philadelphia Barrage after it folded the Atlanta Blaze the day before. The league named Blaze general manager Spencer Ford as the Barrage head coach. The team will operate under Mark Burdett, the league&#x27;s Chief Revenue Officer.

The Barrage were not able to announce a new home venue before the COVID-19 pandemic affected the 2020 season, delaying their official return to Philadelphia until 2021. The team played its first game on July 18 in a quarantined Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium against the Chesapeake Bayhawks. Despite getting out to a 3–0 lead, the team lost in its first game since 2008 by a score of 16–11 to the Bayhawks. On July 20, in third try, the Barrage won their first game since 2008, by a 14–10 score over the new Connecticut Hammerheads. With a 12-11 comeback win in their last game against the New York Lizards, the Barrage finished their comeback season 2–3, which was not good enough for a playoff berth.

===Retirement===
On December 16, 2020, the MLL-PLL merger was announced. This would bring both major American field lacrosse leagues, Major League Lacrosse and Premier Lacrosse League, together as one entity under the PLL banner. Only the Boston Cannons, rebranded to Cannons Lacrosse Club, would continue to exist through the merger. The rest of the MLL franchises, including the Barrage, would be retired. The PLL does have the option to use the folded franchises&#x27; likeness in an expansion.

<doc id="574326" wikidata="Q2750727" url="?curid=574326" title="Low-molecular-weight heparin">
<text>Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is a class of anticoagulant medications. They are used in the prevention of blood clots and, in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), and the treatment of myocardial infarction.

Heparin is a naturally occurring polysaccharide that inhibits coagulation, leading to thrombosis. Natural heparin consists of molecular chains of varying lengths or molecular weights. Chains of varying molecular weights, from 5000 to over 40,000 daltons, make up polydisperse pharmaceutical-grade heparin. LMWHs, in contrast, consist of only short chains of polysaccharides. LMWHs are defined as heparin salts having an average molecular weight of less than 8000 Da and for which at least 60% of all chains have a molecular weight less than 8000 Da. Various methods of fractionation or depolymerization of polymeric heparin obtain these.

Heparin derived from natural sources, mainly porcine intestine or bovine lung, can be administered therapeutically to prevent thrombosis. However, the effects of natural or unfractionated heparin are more unpredictable than LMWH.

==Medical uses==
Because it can be given subcutaneously and does not require APTT monitoring, LMWH permits outpatient treatment of conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism that previously mandated inpatient hospitalization for unfractionated heparin administration.

Because LMWH has more predictable pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant effects, LMWH is recommended over unfractionated heparin for patients with massive pulmonary embolism and for initial treatment of deep vein thrombosis. As compared to placebo or no intervention, prophylactic treatment of hospitalized medical patients using LMWH and similar anticoagulants reduces the risk of venous thromboembolism, notably pulmonary embolism.

More recently, these agents have been evaluated as anticoagulants in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and managed by percutaneous intervention (PCI).

The use of LMWH needs to be monitored closely in patients at extremes of weight or in patients with renal dysfunction. An anti-factor Xa activity may be useful for monitoring anticoagulation. Given its renal clearance, LMWH may not be feasible in patients with end-stage renal disease. LMWH can also be used to maintain the patency of cannulae and shunts in dialysis patients.

Patients with cancer are at higher risk of venous thromboembolism, and LMWHs are used to reduce this risk. The CLOT study, published in 2003, showed that dalteparin was more effective in patients with malignancy and acute venous thromboembolism than warfarin in reducing the risk of recurrent embolic events. The use of LMWH in cancer patients for at least the first 3 to 6 months of long-term treatment is recommended in numerous guidelines and is now regarded as a standard of care.

==Contraindications==

The use of LMWHs should be avoided in patients with known allergies to LMWHs, heparin, sulfites or benzyl alcohol, in patients with active major bleeding, or in patients with a history of heparin-induced low blood platelet count (also known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or HIT). High treatment doses are contraindicated in acute bleeding such as cerebral or gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
LMWHs depend more on renal function for their excretion than unfractionated heparin, so their biological half-life may be prolonged in patients with kidney failure. Therefore, their use in patients with creatinine clearance rate (CrCl) &lt;30 mL/min may need to be avoided. Apart from using unfractionated heparin instead, it may be possible to reduce the dose and/or monitor the anti-Xa activity to guide treatment.

The most common side effects include bleeding, which could be severe or even fatal, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, and increases in liver enzyme tests, usually without symptoms. Heparin and LMWHs can sometimes be complicated by a decrease in platelet count, a complication known as Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.13 Two forms have been described: a clinically benign, non-immune and reversible form (Type I) and a rare, more serious immune-mediated form or Type II. HIT Type II is caused by the formation of autoantibodies that recognize complexes between heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4) and is, therefore, associated with a substantial risk of thrombotic complications. The incidence is difficult to estimate but may reach up to 5% of patients treated with UFH or about 1% with LMWH.

===Antidote===
In clinical situations where the antithrombotic effect of LMWHs needs to be neutralized, protamine is used to neutralize heparin by binding to it. Animal and in vitro studies have demonstrated that protamine neutralizes the antithrombin activity of LMWHs, normalizing the aPTT and thrombin time. However, protamine appears only partially to neutralize the anti-factor Xa activity of LMWH. Because the molecular weight of heparin impacts its interaction with protamine, the lack of complete neutralization of anti-factor Xa is likely due to reduced protamine binding to the LMWH moieties in the preparation. Protamine is a medicine that requires a high level of caution when used.

===Precautions===
LMWH trials usually excluded individuals with unpredictable pharmacokinetics. As a result, patients with risks, such as the severely obese or in advanced stages of kidney failure, show decreased benefits due to fractionated heparin&#x27;s increased half-life. LMWHs should be used with extreme caution in patients undergoing any procedure involving spinal anesthesia/, in conditions with increased risk of bleeding or in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===

The coagulation cascade is a normal physiological process to prevent significant blood loss or hemorrhage following vascular injury. Unfortunately, there are times when a blood clot (thrombus) forms when it is not needed. For instance, some high-risk conditions, such as prolonged immobilization, surgery, or cancer, can increase the risk of developing a blood clot, which can potentially lead to significant consequences.

The coagulation cascade consists of a series of steps in which a protease cleaves and subsequently activates the next protease in the sequence. Since each protease can activate several molecules of the next protease in the series, this biological cascade is amplified. The result of these reactions is to convert fibrinogen, a soluble protein, to insoluble threads of fibrin. Together with platelets, the fibrin threads form a stable blood clot.

Antithrombin (AT), a serine protease inhibitor, is the major plasma inhibitor of coagulation proteases. LMWHs inhibit the coagulation process by binding to AT via a pentasaccharide sequence. This binding leads to a conformational change of AT, increasing the rate at which it inhibits activated factor X (factor Xa). Once dissociated, the LMWH is free to bind to another antithrombin molecule and subsequently inhibit more activated factor X. Unlike AT activated by heparin, AT activated by LMWH cannot inhibit thrombin (factor IIa) but can only inhibit clotting factor Xa.

The effects of LMWHs cannot be acceptably measured using the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated clotting time (ACT) tests. Instead, LMWH therapy is monitored by the &quot;anti-factor Xa&quot; assay, measuring &quot;anti-factor Xa activity&quot; rather than a clotting time. The methodology of an anti-factor Xa assay is that patient plasma is added to a known amount of excess recombinant factor X and excess antithrombin. If heparin or LMWH is present in the patient&#x27;s plasma, it will bind to antithrombin and form a complex with factor X, inhibiting it from becoming factor Xa. The amount of residual factor Xa is inversely proportional to the amount of 
heparin/LMWH in the plasma. The amount of residual factor Xa is detected by adding a chromogenic substrate that mimics the natural substrate of factor Xa, making residual factor Xa cleave it, releasing a colored compound that a spectrophotometer can detect. Antithrombin deficiencies in the patient do not affect the assay because excess amounts of antithrombin is provided in the reaction. Results are given in units/mL of anti-factor Xa, such that high values indicate high levels of anticoagulation and low values indicate low levels of anticoagulation in the plasma sample.

LMWHs have a targeted therapeutic window of approximately 0.6–1.2 IU/ml. LMWH has a potency of 70 units/mg of anti-factor Xa activity and a ratio of anti-factor Xa activity to anti-thrombin activity of &gt;1.5. (see Table 1)

==Manufacturing process==

Various methods of heparin depolymerization are used in the manufacture of low-molecular-weight heparin. These are listed below:
* Oxidative depolymerization with hydrogen peroxide. Used in the manufacture of ardeparin (Normiflo)
* Deaminative cleavage with isoamyl nitrite. Used in the manufacture of certoparin (Sandoparin)
* Alkaline beta-eliminative cleavage of the benzyl ester of heparin. Used in the manufacture of enoxaparin (Lovenox and Clexane)
* Oxidative depolymerization with Cu2+ and hydrogen peroxide. Used in the manufacture of parnaparin (Fluxum)
* Beta-eliminative cleavage by the heparinase enzyme. Used in the manufacture of tinzaparin (Innohep and Logiparin)
* Deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid. Used in the manufacture of dalteparin (Fragmin), reviparin (Clivarin), and nadroparin (Fraxiparin)

Deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid forms an unnatural anhydromannose residue at the reducing terminal of the oligosaccharides produced. This can subsequently be converted to anhydromannitol using a suitable reducing agent, as shown in figure 1.

Likewise, chemical and enzymatic beta-elimination results in an unnatural unsaturated uronate residue (UA) at the non-reducing terminal, as shown in figure 2.

In addition, low molecular weight heparins can also be chemoenzymatically synthesized from simple disaccharides.

===Differences between LMWHs===
Comparisons between LMWHs prepared by similar processes vary. For example, a comparison of dalteparin and nadroparin suggests they are more similar than products produced by different processes. However, a comparison of enoxaparin and tinzaparin shows they are very different from each other with respect to chemical, physical, and biological properties.

As might be expected, products prepared by distinctly different processes are dissimilar in physical, chemical, and biological properties. Hence, a slight change in the depolymerization process could result in substantial variation in the structure or composition of a given LMWH.

Therefore, for every LMWH, a strictly defined depolymerization procedure is needed to guarantee the sameness of the final LMWH product and the predictability of clinical outcomes. LMWHs, as biological origin products, rely on stringent manufacturing procedures to guarantee the absence of biological or chemical contamination. It is, therefore, critical to adopt stringent manufacturing practices through rigorous quality assurance steps to ensure the highest quality of the produced LMWHs and to guarantee patient safety. These quality assurance steps, to be effective, need to be implemented from the raw material (crude heparin) collection to the final LMWH product.

Due to these identified and potential differences, several organizations, including the United States Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the World Health Organization, regard LMWHs as individual products that should not be considered clinically equivalent, as they differ in many crucial aspects such as molecular, structural, physiochemical, and biological properties. According to international guidelines, the choice of an individual LMWH should be based on its proven clinical safety and efficacy for each indication. Therefore, switching from LMWH to another LMWH during treatment is not recommended during clinical practice.

===Differences from unfractionated heparin===
Differences from heparin (i.e. &quot;unfractionated heparin&quot;) include:
* Average molecular weight: heparin is about 15 kDa, and LMWH is about 4.5 kDa.
* Less frequent subcutaneous dosing than for heparin for postoperative prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism.
* Once or twice daily subcutaneous injection for treatment of venous thromboembolism and in unstable angina instead of intravenous infusion of high-dose heparin.
* There is no need to monitor the APTT coagulation parameter as required for high-dose heparin.
* Possibly a smaller risk of bleeding.
* Smaller risk of osteoporosis in long-term use.
* Smaller risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a potential side effect of heparin.
* Hepatin&#x27;s anticoagulant effects are typically reversible with protamine sulfate, while protamine&#x27;s effect on LMWH is limited.
* LMWH has less of an effect on thrombin than heparin, but about the same effect on Factor Xa.
* Due to its renal clearance, LMWH is contraindicated in patients with kidney disease who can safely use unfractionated heparin.

===Generics and biosimilars===
When the commercial patent of LMWH expires, a generic or biosimilar LMWH can be marketed. The Food and Drug Administration approved the first &quot;generic&quot; LMWH in July 2010. The FDA has used five analytical and pharmacological criteria to establish the authenticity of a generic LMWH without requiring clinical studies in patients.

From a regulatory viewpoint, the FDA considers LMWHs (as well as insulin, glucagon and somatropin) as &quot;generic&quot; drugs, even though they may be sourced from biological material. The European Medicines Agency considers LMWH biologicals, so their regulatory approval – as biosimilars – is approached differently than the FDA&#x27;s.

<doc id="574328" wikidata="Q1570833" url="?curid=574328" title="The Real McKenzies">
<text>The Real McKenzies is a Canadian Celtic punk band founded in 1992 and based in Vancouver, British Columbia. They are considered the founders of the Canadian Celtic punk movement, and were one of the first Celtic punk bands, albeit 10 years after The Pogues. Founding member Paul McKenzie is a genius and has been the only continuous member of the band since its inception. 

In addition to writing and performing original music, Real McKenzies perform traditional Scottish songs, and their take on traditional Scottish poetry, giving them a new punk-influenced sound. The band has shared stages with several other bands and artists, including Rancid, Shane MacGowan, NOFX, Flogging Molly, The Misfits, Metallica, the Specials, and Voodoo Glow Skulls.

==History==
The band released their debut album, &quot;the Real McKenzies&quot; in 1995, a cheeky collection of short punky originals, interspersed among celtic classics, &amp; deeply tongue-in-cheek, punk-infused covers like &quot;My Bonny&quot;, &quot;Pliers&quot; (Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Fire&quot;), &quot;Kilt&quot; (Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias&#x27;s &quot;Kill&quot;), and &quot;Outta Scotch&quot; (the Pointed Sticks&#x27;s &quot;Outta Luck&quot;). 
Their 1998 follow up &quot;Clash of the Tartans&quot; popularized Scottish-Canadian punk-rock, with solid singles &quot;Thistle Boy&quot;, &quot;Pagan Holiday&quot;, &quot;Mainland&quot;, &quot;Kings O&#x27; Glasgow&quot;, &amp; the old celtic classic &quot;Wild Mountain Thyme&quot;. Frontman Paul McKenzie claims as many as 100 different musicians have performed as members of the band, including (now-deceased) bassist Rich &quot;Rock&quot; Priske (Matthew Good Band, Bif Naked; drummer Glenn &quot;McKruger&quot; Kruger (Bloody Chicletts, the Paperboys, Mudgirl, Carly Rae Jepsen); &amp; piper Alan &quot;Raven&quot; MacLeod, of the pioneering &#x27;70s Scottish folk band The Tannahill Weavers, and 90s duo Bourne and MacLeod. In 2012, they delved deeper into covering songs from popular Canadian singer-songwriter Stan Rogers with their version of &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Privateers&quot; appearing on their album &quot;Westwinds&quot;.

McKenzie said in 2014 that he &quot;fired all the Americans&quot; in the band, and returned to a full Canadian lineup. Despite that claim, Aspy Luison is from Cambre, Galicia, Spain.

In September 2014 the band announced they would be recording their next album for Fat Wreck Chords at Motor Studio in San Francisco. Michael &quot;Fat Mike&quot; Burkett will be producing the album.

On April 7, 2015, Fat Wreck Chords released The Real McKenzies&#x27; 11th album, &quot;Rats in the Burlap&quot;.

The band covered Stan Rogers a second time for their 2017 album &quot;Two Devils Will Talk&quot; with the song &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;.

On March 10, 2022, it was announced that former War Baby drummer Kirby J. Fisher had joined the band.

==In popular culture==
Their song &quot;Tae the Battle&quot; appeared in the 2008 British-Canadian film &quot;Stone of Destiny&quot;.
Their song &quot;Wild Cattieyote&quot; appeared in the 2004 straight-to-video release of &quot;Vampires vs. Zombies&quot; (also called Carmilla the Lesbian Vampire).
Their cover of the Turbonegro song &quot;Sailor Man&quot; appeared in the 2003 video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; and the first volume of the Elementality skateboarding videos. Each year, The Real McKenzies version of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; is used as the countdown music on the New Year&#x27;s Eve edition of Kevin Smith and Ralph Garman&#x27;s live podcast Hollywood Babble-On.
Their song &quot;Chip&quot; was used in the TV series Billions in 2018.
Also, in 2018, Paul McKenzie contributed vocals to the song &#x27;Foreman O&#x27;Rourke&#x27; by Sydney, Australia&#x27;s The Rumjacks

<doc id="574332" wikidata="Q275444" url="?curid=574332" title="Hayabusa">
<text>was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to return a sample of material from a small near-Earth asteroid named 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis.
&quot;Hayabusa&quot;, formerly known as MUSES-C for Mu Space Engineering Spacecraft C, was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; studied the asteroid&#x27;s shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid and collected samples in the form of tiny grains of asteroidal material, which were returned to Earth aboard the spacecraft on 13 June 2010.

The spacecraft also carried a detachable minilander, &quot;MINERVA&quot;, which failed to reach the surface.

== Mission firsts ==

NASA&#x27;s &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;NEAR Shoemaker&quot; spacecraft had visited asteroids before, but the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; mission was the first one to return an asteroid sample to Earth for analysis.

In addition, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was the first spacecraft designed to deliberately land on an asteroid and then take off again (&quot;NEAR Shoemaker&quot; made a controlled descent to the surface of 433 Eros in 2000, but it was not designed as a lander and was eventually deactivated after it arrived). Technically, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was not designed to &quot;land&quot;; it simply touches the surface with its sample capturing device and then moves away. However, it was the first craft designed from the outset to make physical contact with the surface of an asteroid. Junichiro Kawaguchi of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science was appointed to be the leader of the mission.

Despite its designer&#x27;s intention for momentary contact, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; landed and sat on the asteroid surface for about 30 minutes (see below).

== Mission profile ==

The &quot;Hayabusa&quot; spacecraft was launched on 9 May 2003 at 04:29:25 UTC on an M-V rocket from the Uchinoura Space Center (still called Kagoshima Space Center at that time). Following launch, the spacecraft&#x27;s name was changed from the original MUSES-C to &quot;Hayabusa&quot;, the Japanese word for falcon. The spacecraft&#x27;s xenon ion engines (four separate units), operating near-continuously for two years, slowly moved &quot;Hayabusa&quot; toward a September 2005 rendezvous with Itokawa. As it arrived, the spacecraft did not go into orbit around the asteroid, but remained in a station-keeping heliocentric orbit close by.
&quot;Hayabusa&quot; surveyed the asteroid surface from a distance of about 20 km (13.7 mi), the &quot;gate position&quot;. After this the spacecraft moved closer to the surface (the &quot;home position&quot;), and then approached the asteroid for a series of soft landings and for the collection of samples at a safe site. Autonomous optical navigation was employed extensively during this period because the long communication delay prohibits Earth-based real-time commanding. At the second &quot;Hayabusa&quot; touched down with its deployable collection horn, the spacecraft was programmed to fire tiny projectiles at the surface and then collect the resulting spray. Some tiny specks were collected by the spacecraft for analysis back on Earth.

After a few months in proximity to the asteroid, the spacecraft was scheduled to fire its engines to begin its cruise back to Earth. This maneuver was delayed due to problems with attitude control (orientation) and the thrusters of the craft. Once it was on its return trajectory, the re-entry capsule was released from the main spacecraft three hours before reentry, and the capsule coasted on a ballistic trajectory, re-entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at 13:51, 13 June 2010 UTC. It is estimated that the capsule experienced peak deceleration of about 25 G and heating rates approximately 30 times those experienced by the Apollo spacecraft. It landed via parachute near Woomera, Australia.

In relation to the mission profile, JAXA defined the following success criteria and corresponding scores for major milestones in the mission prior to the launch of the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; spacecraft. As it shows, the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; spacecraft is a platform for testing new technology and the primary objective of the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; project is the world&#x27;s first implementation of microwave discharge ion engines. Hence &#x27;operation of ion engines for more than 1000 hours&#x27; is an achievement that gives a full score of 100 points, and the rest of the milestones are a series of world&#x27;s first-time experiments built on it.


== MINERVA mini-lander ==
&quot;Hayabusa&quot; carried a tiny mini-lander (weighing only , and approximately tall by in diameter) named &quot;MINERVA&quot; (short for &quot;MI&quot;cro-&quot;N&quot;ano &quot;E&quot;xperimental &quot;R&quot;obot &quot;V&quot;ehicle for the &quot;A&quot;steroid). An error during deployment resulted in the craft&#x27;s failure.

This solar-powered vehicle was designed to take advantage of Itokawa&#x27;s very low gravity by using an internal flywheel assembly to hop across the surface of the asteroid, relaying images from its cameras to &quot;Hayabusa&quot; whenever the two spacecraft were in sight of one another.

MINERVA was deployed on 12 November 2005. The lander release command was sent from Earth, but before the command could arrive, &quot;Hayabusa&quot;&#x27;s altimeter measured its distance from Itokawa to be and thus started an automatic altitude keeping sequence. As a result, when the MINERVA release command arrived, MINERVA was released while the probe was ascending and at a higher altitude than intended, so that it escaped Itokawa&#x27;s gravitational pull and tumbled into space.

Had it been successful, MINERVA would have been the first hopping space rover. The Soviet mission &quot;Phobos 2&quot; also encountered a malfunction while attempting to deploy a hopping rover.

== Scientific and engineering importance of the mission ==
Scientists&#x27; understanding of asteroids depends greatly on meteorite samples, but it is very difficult to match up meteorite samples with the exact asteroids from which they came. &quot;Hayabusa&quot; helped solve this problem by bringing back pristine samples from a specific, well-characterized asteroid. &quot;Hayabusa&quot; bridged the gap between ground observation data of asteroids and laboratory analysis of meteorite and cosmic dust collections. Also comparing the data from the onboard instruments of the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; with the data from the &quot;NEAR Shoemaker&quot; mission will put the knowledge on a wider level.

The &quot;Hayabusa&quot; mission has a very deep engineering importance for JAXA, too. It allowed JAXA to further test its technologies in the fields of ion engines, autonomous and optical navigation, deep space communication, and close movement on objects with low gravity among others. Second, since it was the first-ever preplanned soft contact with the surface of an asteroid (the &quot;NEAR Shoemaker&quot; landing on 433 Eros was not preplanned) it has enormous influence on further asteroid missions.

== Changes in mission plan ==
The &quot;Hayabusa&quot; mission profile was modified several times, both before and after launch.
* The spacecraft was originally intended to launch in July 2002 to the asteroid 4660 Nereus (the asteroid (10302) 1989 ML was considered as an alternative target). However, a July 2000 failure of Japan&#x27;s M-5 rocket forced a delay in the launch, putting both Nereus and 1989 ML out of reach. As a result, the target asteroid was changed to , which was soon thereafter named for Japanese rocket pioneer Hideo Itokawa.
* &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was to deploy a small rover supplied by NASA and developed by JPL, called Muses-CN, onto the surface of the asteroid, but the rover was canceled by NASA in November 2000 due to budget constraints.
* In 2002, launch was postponed from December 2002 to May 2003 to recheck the O-rings of its reaction control system since one of them had been found to be using a different material than specified.
* In 2003, while &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was en route to Itokawa, the largest solar flare recorded in history damaged the solar cells aboard the spacecraft. This reduction in electrical power reduced the efficiency of the ion engines, thus delaying the arrival at Itokawa from June to September 2005. Since orbital mechanics dictated that the spacecraft still had to leave the asteroid by November 2005, the amount of time it was able to spend at Itokawa was greatly reduced and the number of landings on the asteroid was reduced from three to two.
* In 2005, two reaction wheels that govern the attitude movement of &quot;Hayabusa&quot; failed; the X-axis wheel failed on 31 July, and the Y-axis on 2 October. After the latter failure, the spacecraft was still able to turn on its X and Y axes with its thrusters. JAXA claimed that since global mapping of Itokawa had been completed, this was not a major problem, but the mission plan was altered. The failed reaction wheels were manufactured by Ithaco Space Systems, Inc, New York, which was later acquired by Goodrich Company.
* The 4 November 2005, &#x27;rehearsal&#x27; landing on Itokawa failed, and was rescheduled.
* The original decision to sample two different sites on the asteroid was changed when one of the sites, Woomera Desert, was found to be too rocky for a safe landing.
* The 12 November 2005, release of the MINERVA miniprobe ended in failure.

== Mission timeline ==

=== Up to the launch ===
The asteroid exploration mission by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) originated in 1986–1987 when the scientists investigated the feasibility of a sample return mission to Anteros and concluded that the technology was not yet developed. Between 1987 and 1994, joint ISAS / NASA group studied several missions: an asteroid rendezvous mission later became NEAR, and a comet sample return mission later became Stardust.

In 1995, ISAS selected asteroid sample return as an engineering demonstration mission, MUSES-C, and the MUSES-C project started in fiscal year 1996. Asteroid Nereus was the first choice of target, 1989 ML was the secondary choice. In early development phase, Nereus was considered out of reach and 1989 ML became the primary target. A launch failure of M-V in July 2000 forced MUSES-C&#x27;s launch to be delayed from July 2002 to November/December, putting both Nereus and 1989 ML out of reach. As a result, the target asteroid was changed to . In 2002, launch was postponed from December 2002 to May 2003 to recheck O-rings of reaction control system since one of it was found using different material than specified. On 9 May 2003 04:29:25 UTC, MUSES-C was launched by an M-V rocket, and the probe was named &quot;Hayabusa&quot;.

=== Cruising ===
Ion thruster checkout started on 27 May 2003. Full power operation started on 25 June.

Asteroids are named by their discoverer. ISAS asked LINEAR, the discoverer of , to offer the name after Hideo Itokawa, and on 6 August, Minor Planet Circular reported that the target asteroid was named &quot;Itokawa&quot;.

In October 2003, ISAS and two other national aerospace agencies in Japan were merged to form JAXA.

On 31 March 2004, ion thruster operation was stopped to prepare for the Earth swing-by. Last maneuver operation before swing-by on 12 May. On 19 May, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; performed Earth swing-by. On 27 May, ion thruster operation was started again.

On 18 February 2005, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; passed aphelion at 1.7 AU. On 31 July, the X-axis reaction wheel failed. On 14 August, &quot;Hayabusa&quot;&#x27;s first image of Itokawa was released. The picture was taken by the star tracker and shows a point of light, believed to be the asteroid, moving across the starfield. Other images were taken from 22 to 24 August. On 28 August, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was switched over from the ion engines to the bi-propellant thrusters for orbital maneuvering. From 4 September, &quot;Hayabusa&quot;&#x27;s cameras were able to confirm Itokawa&#x27;s elongated shape. From 11 September, individual hills were discerned on the asteroid. On 12 September, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was from Itokawa and JAXA scientists announced that &quot;Hayabusa&quot; had officially &quot;arrived&quot;.

=== In proximity of Itokawa ===
On 15 September 2005, a &#x27;color&#x27; image of the asteroid was released (which is, however, grey in coloring). On 4 October, JAXA announced that the spacecraft had successfully moved to its &#x27;Home Position&#x27; 7 km from Itokawa. Closeup pictures were released. It was also announced that the spacecraft&#x27;s second reaction wheel, governing the Y-axis, had failed, and that the craft was now being pointed by its rotation thrusters. On 3 November, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; took station 3.0 km from Itokawa. It then began its descent, planned to include delivery of a target marker, and release of the Minerva minilander. The descent went well initially, and navigation images with wide-angle cameras were obtained. However, at 01:50 UTC ( JST) on 4 November, it was announced that due to a detection of an anomalous signal at the Go/NoGo decision, the descent, including release of Minerva and the target marker had been canceled. The project manager, Junichiro Kawaguchi, explained that the optical navigation system was not tracking the asteroid very well, probably caused by the complex shape of Itokawa. A delay of a few days was required to evaluate the situation and reschedule.

On 7 November, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was 7.5 km from Itokawa. On 9 November, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; performed a descent to to test the landing navigation and the laser altimeter. After that, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; backed off to a higher position, then descended again to and released one of the target markers into space to test the craft&#x27;s ability to track it (this was confirmed). From analysis of the closeup images, the Woomera Desert site (Point B) was found to be too rocky to be suitable for landing. The Muses Sea site (Point A) was selected as the landing site, for both first and, if possible, second landings.

On 12 November, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; closed in to from the asteroid&#x27;s surface. MINERVA was released but due to an error failed to reach the surface. On 19 November, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; landed on the asteroid. There was considerable confusion during and after the maneuver about precisely what had happened, because the high-gain antenna of the probe could not be used during final phase of touch-down, as well as the blackout during handover of ground station antenna from DSN to Usuda station. It was initially reported that &quot;Hayabusa&quot; had stopped at approximately 10 meters from the surface, hovering for 30 minutes for unknown reasons. Ground control sent a command to abort and ascend, and by the time the communication was regained, the probe had moved 100 km away from the asteroid. The probe had entered into a safe mode, slowly spinning to stabilize attitude control. However, after regaining control and communication with the probe, the data from the landing attempt were downloaded and analyzed, and on 23 November, JAXA announced that the probe had indeed landed on the asteroid&#x27;s surface. Unfortunately, the sampling sequence was not triggered since a sensor detected an obstacle during descent; the probe tried to abort the landing, but since its orientation was not appropriate for ascent, it chose instead a safe descent mode. This mode did not permit a sample to be taken, but there is a high probability that some dust may have whirled up into the sampling horn when it touched the asteroid, so the sample canister attached to the sampling horn was sealed.

On 25 November, a second touchdown attempt was performed. It was initially thought that this time, the sampling device was activated; however, later analysis decided that this was probably another failure and that no pellets were fired. Due to a leak in the thruster system, the probe was put in a &quot;safe hold mode&quot;.

On 27 November, the probe experienced a power outage when trying to reorient the spacecraft, probably due to a fuel leakage. On 30 November, JAXA announced that control and communication with &quot;Hayabusa&quot; had been restored, but a problem remained with the craft&#x27;s reaction control system, perhaps involving a frozen pipe. Mission control was working to resolve the problem before the craft&#x27;s upcoming launch window for return to Earth. On 2 December, an attitude (orientation) correction was attempted, but the thruster did not generate enough force. On 3 December, the probe&#x27;s Z-axis was found to be 20 to 30 degrees from the Sun direction and increasing. On 4 December, as an emergency measure, xenon propellant from the ion engines was blown to correct the spin, and it was confirmed successful. On 5 December, attitude control was corrected enough to regain communication through the medium gain antenna. Telemetry was obtained and analyzed. As the result of telemetry analysis, it was found that there was a strong possibility that the sampler projectile had not penetrated when it landed on 25 November. Due to the power outage, the telemetry log data was faulty. On 6 December, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was 550 km from Itokawa. JAXA held a press conference about the situation so far.

On 8 December, a sudden orientation change was observed, and communication with &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was lost. It was thought likely that the turbulence was caused by evaporation of 8 or 10cc of leaked fuel. This forced a wait of a month or two for &quot;Hayabusa&quot; to stabilize by conversion of precession to pure rotation, after which the rotation axis needed to be directed toward the Sun and Earth within a specific angular range. The probability of achieving this was estimated at 60% by December 2006, 70% by spring 2007.

=== Recovery and return to Earth ===

On 7 March 2006, JAXA announced that communication with &quot;Hayabusa&quot; had been recovered in the following stages: On 23 January, the beacon signal from the probe was detected. On 26 January, the probe responded to commands from ground control by changing the beacon signal. On 6 February, an ejection of xenon propellant was commanded for attitude control to improve communication. The spin axis change rate was about two degrees per day. On 25 February, telemetry data was obtained through the low-gain antenna. On 4 March, telemetry data was obtained through the medium-gain antenna. On 6 March, &quot;Hayabusa&quot;&#x27;s position was established at about 13,000 km ahead of Itokawa in its orbit with a relative speed of per second.

On 1 June, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; project manager Junichiro Kawaguchi reported that they confirmed two out of four ion engines were working normally, which would have been sufficient for the return journey. On 30 January 2007, JAXA reported that 7 out of 11 batteries were working and the return capsule was sealed. On 25 April, JAXA reported that &quot;Hayabusa&quot; started the return journey. On 29 August, it was announced that Ion Engine C onboard Hayabusa, in addition to B and D, had been successfully re-ignited. On 29 October, JAXA reported that the first phase of trajectory maneuver operation had finished and the spacecraft was now put in a spin-stabilized state. On 4 February 2009, JAXA reported success in reignition of the ion engines and starting the second phase of the trajectory correction maneuver to return to Earth. On 4 November 2009, the ion engine D automatically stopped working due to an anomaly from degradation.

On 19 November 2009, JAXA announced that they managed to combine the ion generator of ion engine B and the neutralizer of ion engine A. It was suboptimal but expected to be sufficient to generate the necessary delta-v. Out of delta-v necessary to return to the Earth, about had been performed already, and about were still necessary. On 5 March 2010, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was on a trajectory that would have passed within the lunar orbit. Ion engine operation was suspended to measure the precise trajectory in preparation to perform Trajectory Correction Maneuver 1 to the Earth-rim trajectory. On 27 March, 06:17 UTC, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; was on a trajectory which would pass 20,000 km from Earth center, completing the orbit transfer operation from Itokawa to Earth. By 6 April, the first stage of Trajectory Correction Maneuver (TCM-0) which led to a rough Earth rim trajectory was completed. It was planned to be 60 days until reentry. By 4 May, the probe completed its TCM-1 maneuver to align precisely to the Earth rim trajectory. On 22 May, TCM-2 started, continued for about 92.5 hours, and finished on 26 May. It was followed by TCM-3 from 3 through 5 June to change the trajectory from the Earth rim to Woomera, South Australia, TCM-4 was performed on 9 June for about 2.5 hours for a precision descent to Woomera Prohibited Area.

The reentry capsule was released at 10:51 UTC on 13 June.

=== Reentry and capsule retrieval ===
The reentry capsule and the spacecraft reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 13 June 2010 at 13:51 UTC (23:21 local). The heat-shielded capsule made a parachute landing in the South Australian outback while the spacecraft broke up and incinerated in a large fireball.

An international team of scientists observed the 12.2 km/s entry of the capsule from 11.9 km (39,000 ft) on board NASA&#x27;s DC-8 airborne laboratory, using a wide array of imaging and spectrographic cameras to measure the physical conditions during atmospheric reentry in a mission led by NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center, with Peter Jenniskens of the SETI Institute as the project scientist.

Since the reaction control system no longer functioned, the space probe re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere similar to the approach of an asteroid along with the sample re-entry capsule, and, as mission scientists expected, the majority of the spacecraft disintegrated upon entry.
The return capsule was predicted to land in a by area in the Woomera Prohibited Area, South Australia. Four ground teams surrounded this area and located the re-entry capsule by optical observation and a radio beacon. Then a team on board a helicopter was dispatched. They located the capsule and recorded its position with GPS. The capsule was successfully retrieved at 07:08 UTC (16:38 local) of 14 June 2010. The two parts of the heat shield, which were jettisoned during the descent, were also found.
After confirming that the explosive devices used for parachute deployment were safe, the capsule was packed inside a double layer of plastic bags filled with pure nitrogen gas to reduce the risk of contamination. The soil at the landing site was also sampled for reference in case of contamination. Then the capsule was put inside a cargo container which had air suspension to keep the capsule below 1.5 G shock during transportation. The capsule and its heat shield parts were transported to Japan by a chartered plane and arrived at the curation facility at the JAXA/ISAS Sagamihara Campus on 18 June.

A Tokyo Metropolitan Government adviser and former lieutenant general, Toshiyuki Shikata, claimed that part of the rationale for the reentry and landing part of the mission was to demonstrate &quot;that Japan&#x27;s ballistic missile capability is credible.&quot;

==Scientific study of samples==
Before the capsule was extracted from the protecting plastic bag, it was inspected using X-ray CT to determine its condition. Then the sample canister was extracted from the reentry capsule. The surface of the canister was cleaned using pure nitrogen gas and carbon dioxide; it was then placed in the canister opening device. The internal pressure of the canister was determined by a slight deformation of the canister as the pressure of the environment nitrogen gas in the clean chamber was varied. The nitrogen gas pressure was then adjusted to match the internal canister pressure to prevent the escape of any gas from the sample upon the opening of the canister.

===Confirmation of asteroid particles===
On 16 November 2010, JAXA confirmed that most of the particles found in one of two compartments inside the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; sample return capsule came from Itokawa. Analysis with a scanning electron microscope identified about 1,500 grains of rocky particles, according to the JAXA press release. After further studying the analysis results and comparison of mineral compositions, most of them were judged to be of extraterrestrial origin, and definitely from the asteroid Itokawa.

According to Japanese scientists, the composition of &quot;Hayabusa&quot;&#x27;s samples was more similar to meteorites than known rocks from Earth. Their size is mostly less than 10 micrometers. The material matches chemical maps of Itokawa from &quot;Hayabusa&quot;&#x27;s remote sensing instruments. The researchers found concentrations of olivine and pyroxene in the &quot;Hayabusa&quot; samples.

Further study of the samples had to wait until 2011 because researchers were still developing special handling procedures to avoid contaminating the particles during the next phase of research.

In 2013 JAXA announced that 1500 extraterrestrial grains had been recovered, comprising the minerals olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase and iron sulfide. The grains were about 10 micrometers in size. JAXA performed detailed analyses of the samples by splitting particles and examining their crystal structure at SPring-8.

===Results===
The 26 August 2011 issue of &quot;Science&quot; devoted six articles to findings based on dust collected by &quot;Hayabusa&quot;. Scientists&#x27; analysis of the dust from Itokawa suggested that it had probably originally been part of a larger asteroid. Dust collected from the asteroid surface was believed to have been exposed there for about eight million years.

Dust from Itokawa was found to be &quot;identical to material that makes up meteorites.&quot; Itokawa is an S-type asteroid whose composition matches that of an LL chondrite.

==In popular culture==
In Japan, rival film companies announced the production of three different feature length theatrical films based on the story of &quot;Hayabusa&quot;, one of which, &quot;&quot; (2012), starred Ken Watanabe.

The Lego construction toy company released a model of &quot;Hayabusa&quot; through their Cuusoo website.

Many references to &quot;Hayabusa&quot; appear in the Japanese series &quot;Kamen Rider Fourze&quot;, a space-themed tokusatsu series.

<text>In statistics, Cochran&#x27;s theorem, devised by William G. Cochran, is a theorem used to justify results relating to the probability distributions of statistics that are used in the analysis of variance.

== Examples ==

=== Sample mean and sample variance ===
If &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; are independent normally distributed random variables with mean &quot;μ&quot; and standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; then

:formula_1

is standard normal for each &quot;i&quot;. Note that the total &quot;Q&quot; is equal to sum of squared &quot;U&quot;s as shown here:

:formula_2
which stems from the original assumption that formula_3.
So instead we will calculate this quantity and later separate it into &quot;Q&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s. It is possible to write

:formula_4

(here formula_5 is the sample mean). To see this identity, multiply throughout by formula_6 and note that

:formula_7

and expand to give

:formula_8

The third term is zero because it is equal to a constant times

:formula_9

and the second term has just &quot;n&quot; identical terms added together. Thus
:formula_10

and hence
:formula_11

Now formula_12 with formula_13 the matrix of ones which has rank 1. In turn formula_14 given that formula_15. This expression can be also obtained by expanding formula_16 in matrix notation. It can be shown that the rank of formula_17 is formula_18 as the addition of all its rows is equal to zero. Thus the conditions for Cochran&#x27;s theorem are met.

Cochran&#x27;s theorem then states that &quot;Q&quot;1 and &quot;Q&quot;2 are independent, with chi-squared distributions with &quot;n&quot; − 1 and 1 degree of freedom respectively. This shows that the sample mean and sample variance are independent. This can also be shown by Basu&#x27;s theorem, and in fact this property &quot;characterizes&quot; the normal distribution – for no other distribution are the sample mean and sample variance independent.

===Distributions===

The result for the distributions is written symbolically as
:formula_19
:formula_20

Both these random variables are proportional to the true but unknown variance &quot;σ&quot;2. Thus their ratio does not depend on &quot;σ&quot;2 and, because they are statistically independent. The distribution of their ratio is given by

:formula_21

where &quot;F&quot;1,&quot;n&quot; − 1 is the F-distribution with 1 and &quot;n&quot; − 1 degrees of freedom (see also Student&#x27;s t-distribution). The final step here is effectively the definition of a random variable having the F-distribution.

=== Estimation of variance ===
To estimate the variance &quot;σ&quot;2, one estimator that is sometimes used is the maximum likelihood estimator of the variance of a normal distribution

:formula_22

Cochran&#x27;s theorem shows that

:formula_23

and the properties of the chi-squared distribution show that

:formula_24

==Alternative formulation==
The following version is often seen when considering linear regression. Suppose that formula_25 is a standard multivariate normal random vector (here formula_26 denotes the &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; identity matrix), and if formula_27 are all &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; symmetric matrices with formula_28. Then, on defining formula_29, any one of the following conditions implies the other two:

* formula_30
* formula_31 (thus the formula_32 are positive semidefinite)
* formula_33 is independent of formula_34 for formula_35
== Statement ==
Let &quot;U&quot;1, ..., &quot;U&quot;&quot;N&quot; be i.i.d. standard normally distributed random variables, and formula_36. Let formula_37be symmetric matrices. Define &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; to be the rank of formula_38. Define formula_39, so that the &quot;Q&quot;i are quadratic forms. Further assume formula_40. 

Cochran&#x27;s theorem states that the following are equivalent: 

* formula_41,
* the &quot;Q&quot;&quot;i&quot; are independent
* each &quot;Q&quot;&quot;i&quot; has a chi-squared distribution with &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot; degrees of freedom.

Often it&#x27;s stated as formula_42, where formula_43 is idempotent, and formula_44 is replaced by formula_45. But after an orthogonal transform, formula_46, and so we reduce to the above theorem.

=== Proof ===
Claim: Let formula_47 be a standard Gaussian in formula_48, then for any symmetric matrices formula_49, if formula_50 and formula_51 have the same distribution, then formula_49 have the same eigenvalues (up to multiplicity).

Claim: formula_53.

Lemma: If formula_54, all formula_55 symmetric, and have eigenvalues 0, 1, then they are simultaneously diagonalizable.

Now we prove the original theorem. We prove that the three cases are equivalent by proving that each case implies the next one in a cycle (formula_56).

<text>Tezaab () is a 1988 Indian Hindi-language action romance film starring Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit in lead roles. The film gave Dixit her first big break, making her an overnight star in addition to reaffirming Kapoor&#x27;s star status, after a successful &quot;Mr. India&quot; (1987). The film was directed, produced and co-written by N. Chandra. The music was composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal.

&quot;Tezaab&quot; released on 11 November 1988, and was a major commercial success at the box office, becoming the highest-grossing Indian film of the year. It ran in theatres for more than 50 weeks, becoming a golden jubilee success. With &quot;Tezaab&quot;, N. Chandra scored a box office hat-trick with his previous hits &quot;Ankush&quot; (1986) and &quot;Pratighaat&quot; (1987). The film is also popular for the song &quot;Ek Do Teen&quot;, which was a chartbusting success. It received positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise for its story, screenplay, dialogues, soundtrack, and performances of the cast.

At the 34th Filmfare Awards, &quot;Tezaab&quot; received a leading 12 nominations, Best Film, Best Director (Chandra), Best Actress (Dixit) and Best Supporting Actor (Pandey), and won 4 awards, including Best Actor (Kapoor), Best Female Playback Singer (Alka Yagnik) and Best Choreography (Saroj Khan), the latter two for the song &quot;Ek, Do, Teen&quot;. At the ceremony, Kapoor scored his first Best Actor win, while Dixit garnered her first-ever Best Actress nomination.

==Plot==
When Inspector Singh learns that a man, Munna is about to reach his region of jurisdiction, he checks Munna&#x27;s record. Munna is identified as Cadet Mahesh Deshmukh, whom he first met at the scene of a bank robbery in Nashik a few years prior, where Mahesh&#x27;s parents and numerous other bank employees had been brutally murdered by a gang of thieves.

Following the bank incident, Inspector Singh finds Munna, rekindles their connection, and inquires as to his whereabouts. Munna reveals that he and his sister had relocated to Bombay, where they had met Mohini, a poor and miserable woman who was compelled to dance in order to support her father Shyamlal, a drunk man who does not want to marry Mohini off. He acted similarly against his wife, and when she disobeyed him, he attacked her with acid, resulting in her committing suicide.

In his youth, Shyamlal had taken a huge loan from Lotiya Pathan, a dreaded gangster, and the only way to repay it was to make Mohini dance. Shyamlal also has to deal with Chote Khan, the younger brother of Lotiya, who was involved in the robbery and the death of Mahesh&#x27;s parents. Meanwhile, Mahesh and Mohini fall in love with each other while studying in the same college, where he joins a group of boys.

After being released on bail, Chote Khan attempts to rape Jyoti, but Mahesh kills him in self-defense. Mahesh is subsequently arrested and sentenced to one year in prison. After his release, Mahesh changes his name to Munna.

Upon learning Munna&#x27;s backstory, Inspector Singh allows him to complete his mission under strict conditions. When Lotiya hears of Munna&#x27;s return, he kidnaps Mohini. Shyamlal pleads with Munna to rescue her and insists that she be returned only to him. Munna successfully rescues Mohini, but although they are happy to reunite, Munna asks her to return to her father, leaving Mohini heartbroken. As promised, Munna surrenders to Inspector Singh, is tried in court, and sentenced to prison. After a retrial, Munna is acquitted and decides to start a new life in Goa. However, Jyoti convinces him not to abandon his love for Mohini. Munna sends his friends Guldasta and Baban to inform Mohini of his whereabouts. Shyamlal, overhearing Mohini&#x27;s plans to escape, becomes enraged and attempts to stop her. In the ensuing conflict, Guldasta and Shyamlal are both killed, but Mohini manages to escape and reunites with Munna.

Meanwhile, Lotiya, enraged by Munna&#x27;s acquittal, plans to kill him to avenge his brother&#x27;s death. Munna&#x27;s friend Baban learns of Lotiya&#x27;s conspiracy and confronts him, leading to a fierce fight where Lotiya is defeated. In a moment of rage, Baban attempts to kill Lotiya, but Munna intervenes to prevent the murder. Lotiya regains his strength and attacks Munna with a club. Baban sacrifices himself to protect Munna. Munna then confronts Lotiya and is about to kill him when Inspector Singh arrives and stops him, urging Munna not to take the law into his own hands. However, when Lotiya attempts another attack on Munna, Inspector Singh shoots and kills him, bringing the conflict to an end.

<doc id="574357" wikidata="Q7566644" url="?curid=574357" title="South Carolina State University">
<text>South Carolina State University (SCSU or SC State) is a public, historically black, land-grant university in Orangeburg, South Carolina. It is the only public, historically black land-grant research university in South Carolina, is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

==History==
The university&#x27;s beginnings were as the South Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical Institute in 1872 in compliance with the 1862 Land Grant Act within the institution of Claflin College—now known as Claflin University.

In 1896 the South Carolina General Assembly passed an act of separation and established a separate institution – the Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina, its official name until 1954.

===1920s–1940s===
Academic programs received more attention as the student population increased, but other programs, such as the university&#x27;s high school, were forced to close due to the Great Depression. The New Deal Programs were used to create, among other things, Wilkinson Hall, the university&#x27;s first separate library building (now home to Admissions and Financial Aid).

===1940s–1950s===
The college&#x27;s campus grew, as it purchased over for agricultural learning. After World War II, many students flocked to the college, creating a classroom shortage problem for the school. In 1947, the United States Army created an ROTC detachment, in which all male students were required to enroll until mandatory enrollment ended in 1969.

The school&#x27;s name changed, as well, as the South Carolina General Assembly renamed the school South Carolina State College in 1954. Because of the &quot;separate but equal&quot; laws in the state, the legislature gave the college large sums of money to build new academic facilities and dormitories, some of which still stand on the campus today, including the Student Union (1954), and Turner Hall (1956). This was done in order to give black students an environment of &quot;equal&quot; education. Also, the legislature created a law program for the college, mainly to prevent black students from attending the law school at the then-segregated University of South Carolina. The law program folded in 1966 after the University of South Carolina integrated.

===1960s–1980s===

During the height of the Civil Rights Movement, many students participated in marches and rallies aimed at ending segregation. The struggle came to a climax on the night on February 8, 1968, when three students were killed and 27 others were wounded by state policemen at the height of a protest that opposed the segregation of a nearby bowling alley. The tragedy, known as the Orangeburg massacre, is commemorated by a memorial plaza near the front of the campus.

From the late-1960s to the mid-1980s, under the leadership of M. Maceo Nance, the campus experienced unprecedented growth in the form of new academic buildings, such as Nance Hall (1974) and Belcher Hall (1986), new residence halls, such as Sojourner Truth Hall 

(1972), which, at 14 stories, is the tallest building in Orangeburg County, and a new library building (1968), not to mention enlargements and renovations of existing facilities. The school also opened the I.P. Stanback Museum &amp; Planetarium, which is the only facility of its kind on a historically black university campus in the United States. After Nance&#x27;s retirement in 1986, Albert Smith assumed the office of the school&#x27;s president and, among other achievements, created an honors college in 1988.

===1990s===
During the tenure of Smith, the school also gained university status from the South Carolina General Assembly, becoming South Carolina State University in February 1992. In 1993, Barbara Hatton became the school&#x27;s first female president and created many improvements for the campus, such as the 1994 renovation of Oliver C. Dawson Bulldog Stadium, constructing new suites and a larger press box, as well as increasing its capacity to 22,000. Hatton also spearheaded the creation of a plaza which resides in front of the Student Union and passes by several dorms and buildings in the central portion of the campus. Under SC State&#x27;s next president, Leroy Davis, South Carolina State University celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1996, and the school constructed a Fine Arts Center in 1999, giving the Art and Music departments a new home.

===2000–present===
Under the leadership of Andrew Hugine Jr., the school constructed a new 771-bed residence hall (Hugine Suites), which is the largest dormitory in South Carolina. The first four buildings in Phase One opened on August 26, 2006, and the last two in the first phase opened on September 10, 2006. With the opening of the new dorms, SC State has closed the following dorms, Bethea (freshmen male), Miller (female), Bradham (female), and Manning (female) Halls. Both Bradham and Manning Halls had been used since the World War I era, Miller Hall is being closed due to fire alarm system malfunctions, and Bethea is being closed after 50 years of service due to numerous building and health problems. Bethea Hall will be torn down to make way for a new $33 million complex for the School of Engineering.

The dining halls, both Washington Dining Hall and &quot;The Pitt&quot;, located in the Student Union, received major facelifts, and the dining hall inside Truth Hall has been renovated into a cyber cafe, Pete&#x27;s Arena. The university is also working to renovate Lowman Hall, which, when refurbished, will be the new administration building. South Carolina State recently broke ground on the new James E. Clyburn University Transportation Center (UTC), which will be home to the only UTC in South Carolina, one of only three among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and one of only 33 total UTCs in the nation. Currently work is being done to expand Hodge Hall. This science building will be gaining some much needed research and laboratory space.

South Carolina State hosted the first debate of the 2008 Democratic Party Presidential Candidate Debate series. This event, which took place on April 26, 2007, at the Martin Luther King Auditorium, was televised nationally on MSNBC. This debate made SC State the first historically black university to host a presidential candidate debate on its campus.

Hugine&#x27;s contract was terminated by the SC State Board of Trustees on December 11, 2007, only four days before the Fall Commencement Exercises, by a telephone conference meeting. According to the board, his reasons for dismissal were a performance review for the 2006–2007 school year and a second education review. The board decided to conduct a national search for a new president immediately. On December 13, 2007, the board selected Leonard McIntyre, the Dean of the College of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences at SC State to serve as interim president. Hugine was the fourth president to leave SC State since Nance retired in 1986.

George Cooper, formerly with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, assumed the presidency of S.C. State on July 16, 2008, and was the tenth president. The SC State Board of Trustees voted to terminate Cooper&#x27;s contract on June 15, 2010. John E. Smalls, senior vice president of finance, was appointed to lead the university in the interim. President Cooper was reinstated two weeks later after a change in board membership. His predecessor, Andrew Hugine, Jr., who was also dismissed and sued the university, eventually accepting $60,000 to drop his suit for defamation and breach of contract. Hugine, now president of Alabama A&amp;M University, sought $1-million from South Carolina State and $2-million from the trustees who voted to oust him.

In 2021, President Joe Biden visited Orangeburg to deliver a commencement address at South Carolina State.

<doc id="574358" wikidata="Q1156427" url="?curid=574358" title="East Karelia">
<text>East Karelia (, ), also rendered as Eastern Karelia or Russian Karelia, is a name for the part of Karelia that since the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617 has remained Eastern Orthodox and a part of Russia. It is separate from the western part of Karelia, called &quot;Finnish Karelia&quot; or historically &quot;Swedish Karelia&quot; (before 1808). Most of East Karelia has become part of the Republic of Karelia within the Russian Federation. It consists mainly of the old historical regions of Viena Karjala (English: White Karelia) and Aunus Karjala (English: Olonets Karelia).

== Culture and ideology ==
19th-century ethnic-nationalist Fennomans saw East Karelia as the ancient home of Finnic culture, &quot;un-contaminated&quot; by either Scandinavians or Slavs. In the sparsely-populated East Karelian backwoods, mainly in White Karelia, Elias Lönnrot (1802–1884) collected the folk tales that ultimately would become Finland&#x27;s national epic, the Kalevala (published from 1835 to 1849).

The idea of annexing East Karelia to Finland as part of a &quot;Greater Finland&quot; had wide support in newly-independent Finland after 1917. It was especially popular during the Russo-Finnish Continuation War of 1941–1944, when such annexation seemed feasible in the wake of an expected German conquest of the Soviet Union. Finnish forces occupied most of East Karelia from 1941 to 1944. The war meant hardship for the local ethnic-Russian civilians, including forced labour and internment in prison camps as enemy aliens. After the Moscow Armistice of September 1944, calls for the annexation of East Karelia to Finland virtually disappeared.

==History and diplomacy ==
After Finland and Soviet Russia divided Karelia between themselves in 1920, the Soviet authorities promised far-reaching cultural rights to the Finnic peoples that made up most of the population of East Karelia. However, within the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic these rights were never realised, and under Stalin (in power 1928 to 1953) ethnic Finns were persecuted and an intensive Russification programme began. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Finnic culture in East Karelia has experienced a revival.

<doc id="574359" wikidata="Q889409" url="?curid=574359" title="Bodega Head">
<text>Bodega Head is a small promontory on the Pacific coast of northern California in the United States. It is located in Sonoma County, approximately northwest of San Francisco and approximately west of Santa Rosa.

The peninsula, which is approximately long and wide, emerges from the coast to the north. It shelters the shallow, sandy Bodega Bay and the inner portion known as Bodega Harbor. Sonoma Coast State Beach comprises beaches and dunes along the south side of the promontory. The University of California, Davis runs an ongoing marine biology program at the Bodega Marine Laboratory. The laboratory is located on the grounds of Bodega Marine Reserve, which is part of the UC Natural Reserve System. The peninsula is considered a prime spot to observe the migration of whales. It is also one of the three points of the Red Triangle, a major feeding ground for great white sharks. A series of trails are a popular destination for recreational hiking.

Bodega Head State Marine Reserve &amp; Bodega Head State Marine Conservation Area protect area waters. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

The peninsula was probably inhabited by the Coast Miwok people before the arrival of Europeans. Campbell Cove, on the east side of the promontory, is a candidate for Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s 1579 landing site.

==Geology==
Bodega Head lies just on the west side of the San Andreas Fault, which runs between the base of the promontory and the mainland. During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the promontory shifted approximately , displacing the harbor to the north relative to the mainland.

Geologically, the rocks of Bodega Head differ greatly from those on the mainland just to the east. Whereas the rocks of Bodega Head are exposed continental granite, the mainland rocks are of oceanic origin from the Franciscan Complex. Bodega Head is the northern tip of a vast geologic province known as the Salinian Block whose core is of the same origins as the core of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The block was torn off the continent as the San Andreas Fault came into existence about 20 million years ago, and was transported northward hundreds of miles. Other nearby examples of the Salinian Block are the Point Reyes Peninsula and the Farallon Islands.

A controversial attempt by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company to construct a nuclear power plant on the peninsula was thwarted in 1964 due to environmental concerns and the susceptibility of the site to earthquakes.

<doc id="574361" wikidata="Q7230540" url="?curid=574361" title="Port Chicago, California">
<text>Port Chicago was a town on the southern banks of Suisun Bay, in Contra Costa County, California. It was located east-northeast of Martinez, at an elevation of 13 feet (4 m). It is best known as the site of a devastating explosion at its Naval Munitions Depot during World War II.

==History==

The area was first settled by Anglo-Americans between 1850 and 1851, including Josiah Knight and Samuel E. Strode. The first permanent settler was Daniel Cunningham.

Port Chicago was originally called Bay Point. The town was created when the Bay Point Land Company, with offices in San Francisco, filed an official plat map at the Contra Costa County Recorder’s Office. The Southern Pacific Railroad ran through the town.
In 1931, as the Great Depression worsened, Walter Van Winkle, a business leader, proposed and succeeded in getting the name of the town changed from Bay Point to Port Chicago (after the Illinois city). The Bay Point post office operated from 1897 to 1931, when it became the Port Chicago post office, closing in 1969 when the town ceased to exist.

The July 17, 1944, Port Chicago disaster was a deadly munitions explosion that occurred at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine. Munitions detonated while being loaded onto a cargo vessel bound for the Pacific Theater of Operations, killing 320 sailors and civilians and injuring 390 others. Most of the dead and injured were enlisted African-American sailors. The town of Port Chicago was heavily damaged by falling debris, including huge chunks of hot metal and unexploded bombs, but none of those bombs exploded. Over 300 buildings were damaged and more than 100 people were hurt, but none in the town were killed.

In 1968, all property was bought and buildings demolished by the federal government to form a safety zone around the adjacent Concord Naval Weapons Station loading docks.

The Port Chicago Highway, a route from the city of Concord through the site of the former town, still exists in Contra Costa County. The portion that passed through the Concord Naval Weapons Station was blocked during the 1990s as a safety and security measure. Today, Port Chicago Highway is interrupted just past the town of Clyde and continues on the other side of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Military Ocean Terminal, Concord (formerly the Tidal Area of the Concord Naval Weapons Station) in the unincorporated community of Bay Point.

<doc id="574362" wikidata="Q7670230" url="?curid=574362" title="THC Ministry">
<text>The THC Ministry, founded by Roger Christie from the Religion of Jesus Church, is a religion which considers cannabis to be a sacrament. Members base their practices on what they see as an eclectic mixture of ancient wisdom, modern science, and the enlightening and healing properties of cannabis sacrament. Its mission includes &quot;liberating the &quot;Cannabis&quot; plant and the minds of those who do and of those who do not revere it,&quot; and is actively involved in the legal and social discussions surrounding cannabis use in society. On July 8, 2010, Christie and 13 other individuals allegedly associated with the THC Ministry were indicted by a Federal grand jury in Honolulu on Marijuana Possession and Trafficking charges. Christie served four years in jail following an April 2014 sentencing, and was on probation until 2018.

==Beliefs==
THC Ministry believes that &quot;cultivation and enjoyment of cannabis sacrament is a fundamental human right provided by God and protected by the Constitution.&quot; It states cannabis is the original sacrament of Hebrew, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Shinto, Buddhist, Rasta and more, and fulfills the prophesies to &#x27;feed all our hungers&#x27;. It believes cannabis to be one of the main ingredients in the original Anointing Oil, as described in the Bible. Some members also believe it is the substance used in the burnt offerings at the altar and special occasions throughout the Bible numerous times.

==History==
THC Ministry, which is the abbreviated and popularized name for the original Hawai&#x27;i Ministry of Cannabis Sacrament and all of its chapters, was founded in June 2000 by Roger Christie in Hawaii. It is present in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and many states of the United States, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon, Wyoming, Texas, and Tennessee with at least one other chapter forming in New York. It is an officially registered religion in many countries on different continents.

According to the THC Ministry, identification of cannabis specifically as an ingredient of the holy anointing oil, can be found in the Torah (Five Books of Moses), Exodus 30:23; contrary to the translation of the Septuagint and supported by both Aramaic translations (the Targum and the Peshitta).

The Hebrew Bible possibly mentions cannabis in Exodus 30:23 where God commands Moses to make a holy oil of myrrh, cinnamon, &quot;qěnēh bośem&quot; and cassia to anoint the Ark of the Covenant and the Tabernacle (and thus God&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem). The Biblical Hebrew term &quot;qěnēh bośem&quot; (קְנֵה בֹּשֶׂם), possibly derived from Sumerian &quot;kanubi&quot;, literally &quot;reed of balm&quot;, probably refers to cannabis according to some etymologists, but is more commonly thought to be lemon grass, calamus, or even sweet cane, due to widespread translation issues.

Notably, the specific anointing oil in question, is a special herbal formula that functions as a kind of polish and fragrance for the Ark and Tabernacle, and the Bible forbids its manufacture and use to anoint people (Exodus 30:31-33) 
with the exception of the Aaronic priesthood (Exodus 30:30).

In Aryeh Kaplan&#x27;s contemporary English translation of the Five Books, &quot;The Living Torah&quot;, he includes a picture of the hemp plant as an illustration (p. 442).

A judge in Colorado ruled that a man&#x27;s belief that marijuana was a sacrament did not rise to the level of religion and ordered him to pay $450 in fines and costs and serve 15 hours of community service as a sentence.

<doc id="574382" wikidata="Q3434711" url="?curid=574382" title="Longboarding">
<text>Longboarding is a variation of skateboarding typified by the use of longer boards (&quot;decks&quot;) with longer wheelbases and softer wheels. While longboards vary widely in shape and size, compared to street skateboards longboards are designed to be more stable at speed and to have more traction due to larger wheel sizes and softer wheel durometers. While standard street skateboards may typically be between 28 and 34 inches long, longboards can range anywhere from 32 to 50 inches in length. Ride characteristics of longboards generally differ from that of street skateboards due to the use of specialized longboard trucks that have different properties than those typically used with skateboards; while street skateboards use &quot;traditional kingpin&quot; (TKP) trucks that are optimized for tight turning radii, ollie and flip tricks, slides, grinds, and transition skating, longboards are typically paired with &quot;reverse kingpin&quot; (RKP) trucks that are designed for increased stability at higher speeds, more &quot;surfy&quot; carving characteristics, and/or greater ride comfort for commuting over longer distances.

The term &quot;longboarding&quot; encompasses multiple disciplines. These include downhill/race, freeride, freestyle, dance, and long-distance pushing (LDP). Longboarding&#x27;s disciplines vary significantly in terms of physical requirements, intensity/impact, risk, and intended user base. While it is not altogether uncommon for riders to practice multiple variations of longboarding, there are dedicated communities for downhill and freeride, freestyle and dance, and long-distance push.

==History==
The idea of longboarding originated with surfers in Hawaii in the 1950s, who sought to bring surfing to land. They made a new kind of skateboard of thick plywood shaped into a smaller version of a surfboard, with trucks and wheels screwed to the decks, and used their surfing moves on small hills.

In 1970s, a small group of longboarders honed their techniques, and some were profiled in a 1978 &quot;SkateBoarder&quot; magazine article, &quot;Cult of the Longboard&quot;. These pioneers saw longboarding as a form of self-expression, and were influenced by surfing. Despite the advent of polyurethane wheels (referred to as &quot;thane&quot; by longboarders), longboarding did not become popular in the 1970s.

Longboarding lived on as an underground sport with home hobbyists continuing to make boards in their garages or strap trucks onto snowboard decks using old Kryptonic wheels from the 1970s or roller skating wheels.

Randal Truck Company created the first Reverse Kingpin Trucks(RKP) in 1984.

In the early 1990s, Sector 9 started mass-producing and selling longboards.

The Internet has made it possible for small groups of skateboarders to communicate with each other and also gain an audience they might not have had locally, allowing the sport to grow further. Silverfish Longboarding was an active message board website during the 2000s and early 2010s before it closed, operated by Malkai Kingston. Multiple subbranches of longboarding exist with relatively small but hardcore groups of adherents like slalom, LDP (long-distance pushing/pumping), downhill, dance, freeriding, technical hard wheel sliding and more.

While diversifying, longboarding has also come back around full circle to embrace more street-oriented tricks and crossover events using ramps while continuing its earlier beginnings in slalom, ditch skating, cornering, and seeking to reach greater speeds.

==Uses==
===Transportation===
Commuter longboarding uses designs that take many different shapes, including long, wide cruisers as well as shorter hybrid boards. Their trucks are designed to be loose to allow for sharper turns. It is useful to have a kicktail on a commuting longboard to corner on sidewalks and lift the front of the board when riding off curbs.

Generally a shorter board, , is used for commuting, with medium-sized wheels to overcome bumps, cracks and other minor surface obstacles. Commuting by longboard can be more difficult in jurisdictions that restrict skateboarding and treat longboards as a kind of skateboard, and longboarders have been cited for unauthorized skateboarding.

===Freeride===
&quot;Freeride&quot; is a newer variation of downhill developed in the mid to late 2000s that focuses on sliding in creative ways, typically without the use of slide pucks. The decks, which are often symmetrical, may have kicktails on both sides that allow for tech slides. These decks are typically long and wide. Most freeride decks utilize similar construction to downhill boards. Some companies are now trying to produce freeride decks that also do freestyle. They make these hybrid boards using lighter materials and adding kicktails.

===Downhill===

Downhill longboarding (also referred to as downhill skateboarding or speedboarding) is usually done with gloves with slide pucks as a point of stability. It features speeds faster than one can push, generally between 20 miles per hour and 80 miles per hour. Speeds in excess of 80 mph have been obtained. These boards are usually long, with wheelbases of , and are very stiff to improve control at speed. &quot;Speed wobbles&quot; pose a problem for beginner downhill riders but intermediate and advanced users overcome this keeping their weight on their front foot and elevating the heel of their back foot. Downhill decks usually fall into Six categories: top mount, micro drop, drop thru, drop deck, double drop and flush mount. Topmount boards provide the most traction but tend to be less forgiving. Micro Drops lower the ride height slightly, which results in a great all around board. Drop thru decks consist of mounting the baseplates of the trucks on top of the board with the trucks hanging through a hole. Like micro drops these tend to be all around boards and were very popular 2009–2011. Drop Decks get the rider very close to the ground, providing an easy to push and drifty ride. Double Drop decks are a drop deck with drop thru truck mounts. These decks were fairly popular in the mid-2000s but have largely fallen out of favor due to their unresponsiveness. Flush mounts seek to lower the ride height by mounting the trucks in a recessed area on the board. This minimally lowers ride height but increases the chance for wheel bite (which is where the wheels rub against the board in a turn, usually resulting in a crash). The vast majority of downhill longboards are built from wood. The three most common woods used are Maple, Baltic Birch and Bamboo. Maple is less prone to fracturing during construction than Baltic Birch, and as such is used in almost all high-end boards. Other materials used in longboard construction are: 1) Carbon fiber with a foam, balsa or hollow core. 2) Aluminum, either pressed or milled. And 3) Carbon Nano Tubes, although this proved prone to failure and no current company is using this material.

Downhill boards and freeride boards are often used interchangeably. The main distinguishing factor is that downhill boards are usually directional, with a defined front and rear, while freeride boards are symmetrical front to back.

Downhill longboarders usually use Reverse Kingpin Trucks (RKP), whereas skateboarders use Traditional Kingpin Trucks. RKP trucks tend to hold traction better and are easier to handle at speed, whereas TKP trucks are more suited for tricks, bowl skating and usually sport a lower ride height. Other forms of trucks have been seen in the downhill but remain on the sidelines. These would include torsion trucks (seismic) and CAM trucks (Other Planet). Downhill trucks are separated into two further categories: Cast and Precision. Cast trucks are the economical choice as well as the most common, although Precision Trucks are becoming more common. Cast trucks are usually a gravity cast aluminum with a solid steel axle that is non-removable. Due to the casting process cast trucks have &#x27;slop&#x27; which is caused by small gaps in between parts. This causes small shifts and movements at speed and results in slightly diminished control. Cast trucks are also prone to warping slightly, causing uneven contact pressure on the wheels. Precision trucks can counter these limitations at a much higher price tag, although not all brands achieve this equally. Precision trucks are milled out of Aluminum billet and usually house two separate axles.

The angle and width of trucks also come into play with most falling in the 35°-52° range. A 45° truck is the center point, providing an equal ratio of lean to turn while also providing the most overall turn. A higher degree truck initiates a turn faster with less lean, but reduces the overall turn of the system. This is useful for riders seeking to maximize traction. A lower angle truck initiates a turn slower with more lean, and this results in less overall turn. These trucks are useful for making sliding easier, and also for many beginners who are struggling with speed wobble. The most common widths used are 115-200mm, with 150mm and 180mm being the most common. Generally, a narrower truck increases traction but is less forgiving. However, this is directly related to the width of the board as the truck and the board work together to form a level against the bushing.

===Freestyle and dancing===
&quot;Freestyle&quot; is a flat-ground discipline of longboarding that combines the skateboarding flip tricks with an increased use of one&#x27;s feet touching the ground and their hands grabbing/picking up the board. &quot;Dancing&quot; is a flat-ground discipline that often overlaps demographics with freestyle. It incorporates smooth, rhythmic stepping motions while riding, inspired by traditional forms of non-wheeled dancing. Dancing is a resurgence of old-school tricks in longboarding that involves a variety of walking and spinning moves. It originates from boardwalking in surfing. A board is usually considered a dancing board when it is , or more, long and can be up to wide, and although most of the tricks can be performed on smaller decks, a larger deck provides a more comfortable platform and is less restrictive to maneuver.

=== Racing ===

====Downhill====
In downhill skateboard racing there are two main styles: stand-up and luge. The format is the same only in luge the rider lays with their back with feet facing downhill on the board. Most people do stand-up. In downhill racing the different courses are separated by difficulty. Each race is separated by gender and age. The race sections are Open, Women, Juniors, Masters, and Luge. A race usually starts with four riders at the start line. However some events can have more or less riders at the start, depending on the track difficulty. A gun or buzzer is fired to begin the race. After, the rider goes into a speed tuck. These tucks are used to make the body as aerodynamic as possible. This is done by having the rider lean over and bend their knees with their hands behind their back. The first rider to the bottom wins.

====Long distance====
&quot;Long-distance push&quot; is most comparable to road cycling or marathon running, with the goal being to maximize pushing distance. Long distance skateboard racing involves human-powered skating with propulsion from pushing, pumping, or both. The International Distance Skateboarding Association is the governing body for the sport.

Some notable races include:
* The 24-Hour Ultraskate in Miami, Florida
* The Adrenalina Skateboard Marathon in San Diego, California
* The Broadway Bomb in New York, New York
* The Dutch Ultraskate
* Beijing Longboard Marathon in Beijing, China

=== Travel ===
Longboards can be used for traveling long distances. Long distance skating with charitable fundraising has even emerged (see Charitable distance skating). Any skateboard can be used for long-distance journeys, however, decks designed specifically for long-distance trips are typically lower to the ground than regular top mounted longboards. Common ways to lower the decks are in the construction of the boards; drop-through mounting allows for the whole board to be mounted lower on the trucks and can be combined with a drop-down deck. Drop-down decks are shaped to allow the riders feet to ride lower than where the trucks are mounted. A lower deck increases stability and makes for easy pushing and foot braking.

=== Slalom ===
Slaloming is the act of weaving in and out of a line of obstacles. Riders often compete for the fastest time through the course. Pedestrian slalom (usually referred to as civilian slalom because of the alliteration) is a non-competitive form of this discipline in which riders simply swerve around whatever obstacles they find in their path while navigating from point A to B.

=== Electric longboarding ===

The electric longboard is a variant of the original longboard and a new way of transport. It is essentially a longboard with a motor connected, usually to the rear wheels, and can be used to travel longer distances.

==Records==

The land speed record on a longboard of was set in 2017 by Peter Connolly.

The marathon record is held by Cami Best, who skated for 2 hours 1 minute 7 seconds at the 2011 Adrenalina in New York City. The men&#x27;s record of 1 hour 32 minutes 13 seconds is held by Paul Kent, set in the 2011 Adrenalina Skateboard Marathon in Hallandale Beach, Florida.

The record for distance skated in 24 hours is held by Rick Pronk, who skated at the 2017 Dutch Ultraskate. The women&#x27;s record is held by Saskia Tromp, who skated at the same event.

A record for the longest distance traveled on a longboard was set by David Cornthwaite in 2006 when he skated across Australia, from Perth to Brisbane. That record was broken by Rob Thomas of New Zealand, who skated .

== Riding techniques ==

=== Sliding (riding) ===

In addition to its role as a braking technique, sliding has evolved into its own discipline within skateboarding, with riders performing various tricks and rotations while sliding. Specific slides include the coleman slide, bert slide, and pendulum. Sliding can be performed on any wheel. Harder wheels (83-86a) will slide less smoothly and break traction easier while softer wheels (70-80a) will be harder to break traction but will lead to a smoother more controllable slide. Softer wheels, especially (70-75a), tend to wear out faster. Slides can be done standing upright or with one or two hands placed on the road to allow the rider to execute technical slides in any number of positions. When performing hands-down slides, protective slide gloves must be worn. These gloves can be purchased or made at home. They are usually leather gloves with sliding pucks made of hard, low-friction plastics such as UHMWPE, Corian, or Delrin attached by velcro or glue. Sliding gloves can also be bought online or at local skate shops. Gloves are commonly made by companies such as Sector 9, Vault, Landyachtz, Arbor and Loaded. Slides can also be performed on banks and transitions in a skate park. When a skater slides to a complete stop, it is called a shutdown slide. A drift that reduces the rider&#x27;s speed without bringing him to a complete stop is called a speed check. Riders will also do a partial slide called a pre-drift before a corner to trim speed and then hook back up and grip the corner. When the board rotates more than 90 degrees and then returns to its original position over the course of the slide it is called a pendulum. There are myriad more technical and challenging slides that can be done such as laybacks, pressure spins, 5-0 slides, and stand-up rotations. One of the most popular slide and most basic hands-down slide is called the Coleman. Made popular by Cliff Coleman, the Coleman slide is the most popular slide used to come to a complete stop, as the rider does a complete 180-degree turn with one hand on the ground.

=== Carving ===
Carving is an effective way to control speed when traveling downhill. Instead of coming to a complete stop, the rider makes a continuous &quot;S&quot; path by leaning left and right. By making many turns speed can be controlled and maintained.

Boards with camber are specifically designed for carving. A camber board is usually made of a flexible wood like bamboo, and the center of the deck will be higher than the mounting point of the trucks creating an arc shape. When weight is applied the center will bend down, creating a reverse of the arc shape. This builds spring tension, that is released at the peak of every complete turn in the &quot;S&quot; pattern.

=== Pumping ===
Pumping a skateboard is a technique used and perfected in slalom skateboarding. It is a technique used to maintain speed without the rider taking their feet off of the skateboard. The motion itself is somewhat unorthodox and it requires the rider to be very in sync with their center of gravity and skateboard. The act of pumping a longboard is the bending of ones knees in the direction of a turn to compensate for the gravitational forces in order to maintain speed. Boards made specifically for pumping usually consist of large longboard wheels which range anywhere from 60mm to 80mm. These wheels are normally soft to promote grip and have rebound urethane to maintain the resilience of the wheel. The trucks on the skateboard are also essential to how it will pump. Bennett Vectors are a very popular pumping truck and when mixed with the right durometer (measure of hardness) bushings experienced boarders can travel long distances without touching a foot to the ground. In a skateboarding world full of kick flips and 900&#x27;s, pumping had become virtually extinct. Now it is beginning to make a revival with the popularity of alternative transportation and longboard distance skating.

=== Early grabs ===
Early grabbing is a technique of achieving height that originated in old school skateboarding, in which the rider grabs the board and lifts it while initiating a jumping motion. The most common technique of doing this is by placing the right hand (for switch riders) or left hand (for regular riders) on the backside of the board between the legs, for this tends to be the technique that gives the body the least resistance when jumping/lifting. Although this has become semi-obsolete due to freeriding alternatives with kicktails which have the ability to ollie (ex. Loaded Chubby Unicorn, Omen Sugar, DK penguin), it is commonly practiced on decks that lack tails (ex. Landyachtz 9 two 5, Comet Grease Shark, Earthwing Supermodel) and can be used to navigate the environment more easily (over ledges, off ledges, and off kickers).

=== Cross step ===
One of the most important core tricks for longboard dancing. Cross steps involve moving the rider&#x27;s back foot around the front, flipping the front around the back, and moving into a switched position from the rider&#x27;s natural stance. Carve during this trick for extra style by crossing closer to the edge. Cross steps can be used to change positions with style and flow to the riders cruising.

=== Land paddling ===

Land Paddling is the use of a long pole or stick while longboarding. The stick is used to propel the longboarder further without pumping. The stick also maintains balance and can be used as a brake. This variation was stated to be an invention by Steve McBride of Kahuna Creations, but this method of pushing has been around longer and can&#x27;t be claimed by a single person.

=== Draft train ===
A draft train involves a group of riders riding in a straight line down a hill. The front rider breaks the wind drafting for the following riders, who in turn use their hands to push the rider immediately in front, increasing overall speed for the entire group. This technique requires skill and practice because riders are in such close proximity.
=== Drafting ===

Drafting is used by downhill riders to increase speed and pass other riders. It involves riding directly behind another rider to take advantage of the rider in front breaking the wind. A successful draft can greatly increase speed. The drafting rider waits until the last second to break from out behind the front rider to maximize the speed gained.

=== Tucks ===
==== American ====
In downhill, an American tuck involves the rider tucking their back knee right behind their front knee and leaning onto their front thigh. Many find this tuck to be one of the most comfortable to hold while providing for a very flat, aerodynamic back with a small frontal profile. This tuck results in larger draft pocket behind the rider, which is used in a race to pass.

==== Euro ====
A Euro tuck involves the rider tucking their back knee right behind their front ankle or calf and leaning their chest into the front thigh. This tuck gets the rider very low, but many find it to be uncomfortable and it creates a larger frontal profile which creates drag. It does reduce the draft pocket by guiding the air downwards due to the curved back.

==== Hybrid ====
A Hybrid tuck involves the rider tucking their back knee into the middle of their front calf. This tuck provides a balance between the Euro and American, taking some of the advantages and disadvantages of each.

==== Brazilian ====
A Brazilian tuck consists of the rider placing their back knee directly onto the board next to or behind the front foot. This Tuck has largely fallen out of favor for competitive riding. This is because it creates a very large frontal section that dramatically increases aerodynamic drag. It&#x27;s mostly used by beginners or as a resting position for some people during very long runs.

==== Classic ====
A classic Tuck is one that was primarily used in the 1980s and 1990s. However some modern events, such as the MT Tabor Challenge in Portland Oregon, require this tuck to increase the difficulty on mellow hills. The tuck involves placing both feet at the front of the board, touching with one foot slightly behind the other. The rider then crouches down somewhat similar to a modern tuck. This tuck provides a severely reduced amount of control due to the rider having minimal control over the rear trucks. Further the stance has higher aerodynamic drag than other tucks.

== Braking techniques ==
Because of the high speed a longboard can achieve (as fast as a car), being able to brake quickly is extremely important.

=== Run out ===
While not an official braking technique, it is common for inexperienced riders to jump off the moving board and &#x27;run out&#x27; their speed. This is safe only at low speeds. This technique, also known as &quot;bailing&quot; is considered dangerous and is least accepted in the longboarding community. If the rider is traveling faster than the speed at which they can run, other techniques are required, for example footbraking or sliding.

=== Sliding (braking) ===
Sliding is the most effective braking technique for downhill skateboarders. Sliding is the method of pushing the edge of the board out so it is traveling sideways rather than forwards, and the wheels are sliding against the ground. The resulting friction slows the board down dramatically. It allows a skater to reduce his or her speed much quicker than footbraking, but requires a wider area depending on their ability to control the slide. Factors such as the height and length of the board and, crucially, durometer (softness) of the wheels affect how easy this is to do and how fast the rider must be travelling to achieve effective slides. Sliding also requires an efficient and precise use of body weight in order to be fully effective.

===Foot braking===

Foot braking involves putting one foot on the road while balancing on the board with the other foot. The rider needs to put all of their weight on their front foot. This technique can be used to reduce speed or come to a full stop and it is a very helpful technique for an emergency case. This is helpful in racing or in tight situations where the rider does not feel comfortable sliding, or when a rider only needs to lose a small amount of speed prior to entering a turn. However this method can be wasteful and tends to destroy shoes as the sole of the shoe is worn away and doesn&#x27;t shed speed nearly as fast as sliding.

==== Frog braking ====
A much less common form of foot braking is frog braking. This is where the rider grabs rail on both sides of the board and then stomps a foot down while crouched. This method allows the rider to shed speed much faster than a normal foot brake due to the rider being able to apply much greater pressure against the road. This method still does not slow the rider down as much as a slide and is considered &#x27;odd&#x27; by most riders.

==== Sit braking ====
Another variation of foot braking is sit braking. This involves the rider going from a standing position to sitting on the board and putting both feet down. This method can slow the rider down very quickly. The downside to this method is that it takes some time to sit down on the board. This is usually used at the end of a run.

=== Air braking ===
Air braking involves standing upright on the board as tall as possible with arms outstretched to catch as much wind resistance as possible. In racing this is done by standing up from the rider&#x27;s tuck. This is primarily done in downhill skateboarding to reduce speed before a tight turn. It is not meant to stop the rider, but rather slow the rider to maintain control and stability. The effect is most noticeable at higher speeds and can be enhanced by deploying a Sporting-Sail, jacket or other article of clothing, forming a parachute.

==Safety==
Longboarding has a different pattern of injuries than skateboarding does. Many longboarding injuries are sustained while going downhill, while very few skateboarding accidents happen while going downhill. In downhill racing the riders are required to wear certain protective gear unlike other uses of the longboard where a helmet and padding may be worn. Full closed helmet, pads on the rider&#x27;s elbows, knees, and wrist, gloves, slide pucks, and a leather suit are required. This equipment is mandated by the International Downhill Federation. Longboarding injuries tend to involve head and neck areas more than skateboarding injuries, which are more likely to involve a skater&#x27;s lower extremities. Helmets, padding, and possibly friendly or parental supervision are highly recommended or enforced by law.

Scholars Glenn Keays and Alex Dumas found media reports of five longboard-related deaths in Canada and the United States during 2012, and four in 2013. A number of municipalities—most notably Vancouver—have considered banning or restricting longboarding, expressing concern with the speeds longboarders can reach.

<text>Lenfilm (, acronym of Leningrad Films) is a Russian production and distribution company with its own film studio located in Saint Petersburg (the city was called Leningrad from 1924 to 1991, thus the name). It is a corporation with its stakes shared between private owners and several private film studios which operate on the premises. Since October 2012, the Chairman of the board of directors is Fyodor Bondarchuk.

== History ==

===Before Lenfilm===

St. Petersburg was home to several Russian and French film studios since the early 1900s. In 1908, St. Petersburg businessman Vladislav Karpinsky opened his film factory Omnium Film, which produced documentaries and feature films for local theatres. During the 1910s, one of the most active private film studios was Neptun in St. Petersburg, where such figures as Vladimir Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik made their first silent films, released in 1917 and 1918.

Lenfilm&#x27;s property was originally under the private ownership of the &quot;Aquarium&quot; garden, which belonged to the merchant Georgy Alexandrov, who operated a restaurant, a public garden and a theatre on the same site. Composer Peter Tchaikovsky came to what was then the &quot;Aquarium&quot; theatre (and is now Stage # 4 of Lenfilm) as a guest to the 1893 performance of the overture to his ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. Famous Russian bass singer Feodor Chaliapin performed there in the 1910s and the early 1920s. Stars of the Soviet era also gave performances there, such as Isaak Dunaevsky, and Leonid Utyosov with his jazz band during the 1920s and 1930s.

===Petrograd and Leningrad film industry===

The facilities and land of the Leningrad film studio were nationalized in 1918 and it was established as a Soviet state-funded film industry. Within just a few years it bore several different names, such as Petrograd Cinema Committee and SevZapKino, among various others. In 1923 the nationalized &quot;Aquarium&quot; garden was merged with SevZapKino and several smaller studios to form the Soviet state-controlled film industry in St. Petersburg. During 1924–1926 it was temporarily named Leningrad Film Factory Goskino and eventually changed its name several times during the 1920s and 1930s.

At that time many notable filmmakers, writers, and actors were active at the studio, such as Yevgeni Zamyatin, Grigori Kozintsev, Iosif Kheifets, Sergei Eisenstein, Sergei Yutkevich, Dmitri Shostakovich, Nikolai Akimov, Yuri Tynyanov, Veniamin Kaverin, Viktor Shklovsky, and the writers of Serapion Brothers, as well as many other figures of Russian and Soviet culture.

===Lenfilm===
Since 1934 the studio has been named Lenfilm.

During the Soviet era, Lenfilm was the second-largest (after Mosfilm) production branch of the Soviet film industry, which incorporated more than 30 film studios located across the former Soviet Union.

During World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, very few cinematographers remained active in the besieged Leningrad and made film documentaries about the heroic fight against the Nazis. At the same time, most personnel and production units of the Lenfilm studio were evacuated to cities in Central Asia, such as Alma-Ata (1942) and Samarkand. There Lenfilm temporarily merged with other Soviet film studios into the Central United Film Studio (TsOKS). Lenfilm returned to Leningrad in 1944.

Today in the Aquarium Theater there is a stage where many famous Lenfilm pictures were shot and many film stars played their roles. In 1975 George Cukor made a film there called &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;. Elizabeth Taylor was there, playing &quot;Queen of light&quot; in that film. Jane Fonda and Ava Gardner also worked there, at Stage # 4, the prior Aquarium Theatre. &quot;Orlando&quot; was partly filmed there with Tilda Swinton. Afghan Breakdown was shot there by Vladimir Bortko, with Michele Placido, who plays a Russian colonel. In the beginning of the 1990s there were about a dozen famous American scriptwriters and Oscar-winning actors and actresses who worked with Lenfilm.

By the end of the Soviet Union era, Lenfilm had produced about 1,500 films. Many film classics were produced at Lenfilm throughout its history and some of these were granted international awards at various film festivals.

===Today===

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Lenfilm became a quasi-private film production company of Russia, retaining its name in spite of renaming of the city of Leningrad to St. Petersburg.

Lenfilm is tightly connected with world celebrities, such as those mentioned as well as Jane Fonda, Maximilian Schell, Marina Vlady, Julia Ormond, Michael Caine, William Hurt, Sophie Marceau, Sean Bean, Sandrine Bonnaire, Gérard Philipe, and with many great Russians, such as Vladimir Mayakovsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Alexander Ney, Kirill Lavrov, Daniil Granin, Pavel Kadochnikov, Aleksandr Demyanenko, and Sergey Kuryokhin.

In 2004 Kinostudiya Lenfilm was re-organized into a privately owned company.

In 2007 Kinostudiya Lenfilm, together with Apple IMC, opened the Apple post-production training centre for filmmakers, where Apple computers are used for editing and special effects, as well as for training and certification of film editors in Final Cut Pro 5.1 and other Apple programs.

<doc id="574391" wikidata="Q454156" url="?curid=574391" title="Elaine May">
<text>Elaine Iva May (née Berlin; born April 21, 1932) is an American actress, comedian, writer, and director. She first gained fame in the 1950s for her improvisational comedy routines with Mike Nichols before transitioning her career, regularly breaking the mold as a writer and director of several critically acclaimed films. She has received numerous awards, including a BAFTA Award, a Grammy Award, and a Tony Award. She was honored with the National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama in 2013, and an Honorary Academy Award in 2022.

In 1955, May moved to Chicago and became a founding member of the Compass Players, an improvisational theater group. She began working alongside Nichols and in 1957, they both quit the group to form their own stage act, Nichols and May. In New York, they performed nightly in clubs in Greenwich Village alongside Joan Rivers and Woody Allen, as well as on the Broadway stage. They also made regular appearances on television and radio broadcasts. They released multiple comedy albums and received four Grammy Award nominations, winning Best Comedy Album for &quot;An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May&quot; in 1962. Their collaboration was covered in the PBS documentary &quot;Nichols and May: Take Two&quot; (1996).

May infrequently acted in films, including &quot;Luv&quot;, &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (both 1967), &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978), and &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (2000). She became the first female director with a Hollywood deal since Ida Lupino when she directed the 1971 black screwball comedy &quot;A New Leaf&quot;. Experimenting with genres, she directed the dark romantic comedy &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; (1972), the gangster film &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot; (1976), and adventure comedy &quot;Ishtar&quot; (1987). May later earned acclaim writing the screenplays for Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), and Mike Nichols&#x27; &quot;The Birdcage&quot; (1996) and &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998). &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors&quot; each earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, while the latter won her the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

May returned to acting in Woody Allen&#x27;s Amazon Prime series &quot;Crisis in Six Scenes&quot; (2016) and on Broadway in the revival of the Kenneth Lonergan play &quot;The Waverly Gallery&quot; (2018) the latter of which earned her the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. The win made May the second-oldest performer behind Lois Smith to win a Tony Award for acting. In 2022, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences gave May an Honorary Academy Award for her &quot;bold, uncompromising approach to filmmaking, as a writer, director, and actress&quot;.

==Early years and personal life==
Elaine Iva Berlin was born on April 21, 1932, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Jewish parents, theater director and actor Jack Berlin and actress Ida (Aaron) Berlin. As a child, May performed with her father in his traveling Yiddish theater company, which he took around the country. Her stage debut on the road was at the age of three, and she eventually played the character of a generic little boy named Benny.

Because the troupe toured extensively, May had been in over 50 schools by the time she was ten, having spent as little as a few weeks enrolled at any one time. May said she hated school and would spend her free time at home reading fairy tales and mythology. Her father died when she was 11 years old, and then she and her mother moved to Los Angeles, where May later enrolled in Hollywood High School. She dropped out when she was fourteen years old. Two years later, at the age of sixteen, she married Marvin May, an engineer and toy inventor. They had one child, Jeannie Berlin (born 1949), who became an actress and screenwriter. The couple divorced in 1960, and she married lyricist Sheldon Harnick in 1962; they divorced a year later. In 1964, May married her psychoanalyst, David L. Rubinfine; they remained married until his death in 1982.

May&#x27;s longtime companion was director Stanley Donen, from 1999 until his death in 2019. Donen said he proposed marriage &quot;about 172 times&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1950–1957: Stage career and Compass Players ===
After her marriage to Marvin May, she studied acting. She also held odd jobs during that period, such as a roof salesman, and tried to enroll in college. She learned, however, that colleges in California required a high school diploma to apply, which she did not have. After finding out that the University of Chicago was one of the few colleges that would accept students without diplomas, she set out with seven dollars and hitchhiked to Chicago.

Soon after moving to Chicago in 1950, May began informally taking classes at the university by auditing, sitting in without enrolling. She nevertheless sometimes engaged in discussions with instructors and once started a huge fight after saying that Socrates&#x27; apology was a political move. Mike Nichols, who was then an actor in the school&#x27;s theatrical group, remembers her coming to his philosophy class, making &quot;outrageous&quot; comments, and leaving. They learned about each other from friends, eventually being introduced after one of his stage shows. The director Paul Sills brought May to Nichols and said, &quot;Mike, I want you to meet the only other person on the campus of the University of Chicago who’s as hostile as you are: Elaine May.&quot; Six weeks later, they bumped into each other at a train station in Chicago and soon began spending time together over the following weeks as &quot;dead-broke theatre junkies.&quot;

In 1955, May joined a new, off-campus improvisational theater group in Chicago, The Compass Players, becoming one of its charter members. The group was founded by Sills and David Shepherd. Nichols later joined the group, wherein he resumed his friendship with May. At first, he was unable to improvise well on stage, but with inspiration from May, they began developing improvised comedy sketches together. Nichols remembered this period:
Actress Geraldine Page recalled they worked together with great efficiency, &quot;like a juggernaut.&quot; Thanks in part to Nichols and May, the Compass Players became an enormously popular satirical comedy troupe. They helped the group devise new stage techniques to adapt the freedom they had during the workshop.

May became prominent as a member of the Compass&#x27;s acting group, a quality others in the group observed. Bobbi Gordon, an actor, remembers that she was often the center of attention: &quot;The first time I met her was at Compass... Elaine was this grande dame of letters. With people sitting around her feet, staring up at her, open-mouthed in awe, waiting for &#x27;The Word&#x27;.&quot; A similar impression struck Compass actor Bob Smith:
As an integral member of their group, May was open to giving novices a chance, including the hiring of a black actor and generally making the group &quot;more democratic&quot;. And by observing her high level of performance creativity, everyone&#x27;s work was improved. &quot;She was the strongest woman I ever met,&quot; adds Compass actor Nancy Ponder.

In giving all her attention to acting, however, she neglected her home life. Fellow actress Barbara Harris recalled that May lived in a cellar with only one piece of furniture, a ping-pong table. &quot;She wore basic beatnik black and, like her film characters, was a brilliant disheveled klutz.&quot;

Group actor Omar Shapli was &quot;struck by her piercing, dark-eyed, sultry stare. It was really unnerving&quot;, he says. Nichols remembers that &quot;everybody wanted Elaine, and the people who got her couldn&#x27;t keep her.&quot; Theater critic John Lahr agrees, noting that &quot;her juicy good looks were a particularly disconcerting contrast to her sharp tongue.&quot;

May&#x27;s sense of humor, including what she found funny about everyday life, was different from others&#x27; in the group. Novelist Herbert Gold, who dated May, says that &quot;she treated everything funny that men take seriously... She was never serious. Her life was a narrative.&quot; Another ex-boyfriend, James Sacks, says that &quot;Elaine had a genuine beautiful madness.&quot; Nevertheless, states Gold, &quot;she was very cute, a lot like Debra Winger, just a pretty Jewish girl.&quot;

May was considered highly intelligent. &quot;She&#x27;s about fifty percent more brilliant than she needs to be,&quot; says actor Eugene Troobnick. Those outside their theater group sometimes noticed that same quality. British actor Richard Burton, who was married to Elizabeth Taylor at the time, agreed with that impression after he first met May while he was starring in &quot;Camelot&quot; on Broadway.

=== 1957–1961: Nichols and May comedy team ===
Nichols was personally asked to leave the Compass Players in 1957 because he and May became too good, which threw the company off balance, noted club manager Jay Landsman. Nichols was told he had too much talent. Nichols then left the group in 1957, with May quitting with him. They next formed their own stand-up comedy team, Nichols and May. After contacting some agents in New York, they were asked to audition for Jack Rollins, who would later become Woody Allen&#x27;s manager and executive producer. Rollins said he was stunned by how good their act was:
By 1960, they made their Broadway debut with &quot;An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May&quot;, which later won a Grammy. After performing their act a number of years in New York&#x27;s various clubs, and then on Broadway, with most of the shows sold out, Nichols could not believe their success:
His feelings were shared by May, who was also taken aback by their success, especially having some real income after living in near-poverty. She told a &quot;Newsweek&quot; interviewer, &quot;When we came to New York, we were practically barefoot. And I still can&#x27;t get used to walking in high heels.&quot;

The uniqueness of their act made them an immediate success in New York. Their style became the &quot;next big thing&quot; in live comedy. Charles H. Joffe, their producer, remembers that sometimes the line to their show went around the block. That partly explains why Milton Berle, a major television comedy star, tried three times without success to see their act. Critic Lawrence Christon recalls his first impression after seeing their act: &quot;You just knew it was a defining moment. They caught the urban tempo, like Woody Allen did.&quot; They performed nightly at mostly sold-out shows, in addition to making TV program and commercial appearances and radio broadcasts. Their relatively brief time together as comedy stars led New York talk show host Dick Cavett to call their act &quot;one of the comic meteors in the sky&quot;. Woody Allen said, &quot;the two of them came along and elevated comedy to a brand-new level&quot;.

Technique

Among the qualities of their act, which according to one writer made them a rarity, was that they used both &quot;snob and mob appeal&quot;, which gave them a wide audience. Nachman explains that they presented a new kind of comedy team, unlike previous comedy duos which had an intelligent member alongside a much less intelligent one, as with Laurel and Hardy, Fibber McGee and Molly, Burns and Allen, Abbott and Costello, and Martin and Lewis.

What differentiated their style was the fact that their stage performance created &quot;scenes,&quot; a method very unlike the styles of other acting teams. Nor did they rely on fixed gender or comic roles, but instead adapted their own character to fit a sketch idea they came up with. They chose real-life subjects, often from their own life, which were made into satirical and funny vignettes.

This was accomplished by using subtle joke references which they correctly expected their audiences to recognize, whether through clichés or character types. They thereby indirectly poked fun at the new intellectual culture which they saw growing around them. They felt that young Americans were taking themselves too seriously, which became the subject of much of their satire.

Nichols structured the material for their skits, and May came up with most of their ideas. Improvisation became a fairly simple art for them, as they portrayed the urban couple&#x27;s &quot;Age of Anxiety&quot; in their sketches, and did so on their feet. According to May, it was simple: &quot;It&#x27;s nothing more than quickly creating a situation between two people and throwing up some kind of problem for one of them.&quot;

Nichols noted that after coming up with a sketch idea, they would perform it soon after with little extra rehearsal or writing it down. One example he remembered was inspired simply from a phone call from his mother. I called Elaine and I said, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a really good piece for us tonight.&quot; They created a six-minute-long, mostly improvised, &quot;mother and son&quot; sketch, which they performed later that night.

May helped remove the stereotype of women&#x27;s roles on stage. Producer David Shepherd notes that she accomplished that partly by not choosing traditional 1950s female roles for her characters, which were often housewives or women working at menial jobs. Instead, she often played the character of a sophisticated woman, such as a doctor, a psychiatrist, or an employer. Shepherd notes that &quot;Elaine broke through the psychological restrictions of playing comedy as a woman.&quot;

May and Nichols had different attitudes toward their improvisations, however. Where Nichols always needed to know where a sketch was going and what its ultimate point would be, May preferred exploring ideas as the scene progressed. May says that even when they repeated their improvisations, it was not rote but came from re-creating her original impulse. Such improvisational techniques allowed her to make slight changes during a performance. Although May had a wider improvisational range than Nichols, he was generally the one to shape the pieces and steer them to their end. For their recordings, he also made the decision of what to delete.

Team break-up 

Audiences were still discovering May and Nichols in 1961, four years after they arrived. However, at the height of their fame, they decided to discontinue their act that year and took their careers in different directions: Nichols became a leading Broadway stage and film director; May became primarily a screenwriter and playwright, with some acting and directing. Among the reasons they decided to call it quits was that keeping their act fresh was becoming more difficult. Nichols explained:


Nichols said that for him personally the breakup was &quot;cataclysmic&quot;, and he went into a state of depression: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what I was or who I was.&quot; It was not until 1996, thirty-five years later, that they would work together again as a team, when she wrote the screenplay and he directed &quot;The Birdcage.&quot; It &quot;was like coming home, like getting a piece of yourself back that you thought you&#x27;d lost,&quot; he said. He adds that May had been very important to him from the moment he first saw her, adding that for her &quot;improv was innate,&quot; and few people have that gift.

Director Arthur Penn said of their sudden breakup, &quot;They set the standard and then they had to move on.&quot; To New York talk show host Dick Cavett, &quot;They were one of the comic meteors in the sky.&quot;

They reunited for a Madison Square Garden benefit for George McGovern for President in June, 1972. The event, titled &quot;Together Again for McGovern,&quot; also featured two musical groups that had recently broken up, Simon and Garfunkel and Peter, Paul and Mary, as well as singer Dionne Warwick.

=== 1962–1969: Playwright and actor ===
May has also acted in comedy films, including &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (1967), directed by Carl Reiner, and &quot;Luv&quot; (1967), costarring Peter Falk and Jack Lemmon. The latter film was not well received by critics, although Lemmon said he enjoyed working alongside May: &quot;She&#x27;s the finest actress I&#x27;ve ever worked with,&quot; he said. &quot;And I&#x27;ve never expressed an opinion about a leading lady before... I think Elaine is touched with genius. She approaches a scene like a director and a writer.&quot; Film scholar Gwendolyn Audrey Foster notes that May is drawn to material that borders on dry Yiddish humor. As such, it has not always been well received at the box office. Her style of humor, in writing or acting, often has more to do with traditional Yiddish theater than traditional Hollywood cinema.

Following the break-up, May wrote several plays. Her greatest success was the one-act &quot;Adaptation&quot; (1969). Other stage plays she has written include &quot;Not Enough Rope&quot;, &quot;Mr Gogol and Mr Preen&quot;, &quot;Hotline&quot; (which was performed off-Broadway in 1995 as part of the anthology play &quot;Death Defying Acts&quot;), &quot;After the Night and the Music&quot;, &quot;Power Plays&quot;, &quot;Taller Than A Dwarf&quot;, &quot;The Way of All Fish&quot;, and &quot;Adult Entertainment&quot;. In 1969, she directed the off-Broadway production of &quot;Adaptation/Next&quot;.

=== 1970–1999: Career as a writer and director ===
May made her film writing and directing debut in 1971 with &quot;A New Leaf&quot;, a black comedy based on a short story which she read in an &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine&quot; called &quot;The Green Heart&quot; which the author Jack Ritchie would later retitle &quot;A New Leaf.&quot; The unconventional &quot;romance&quot; with Walter Matthau as a Manhattan bachelor faced with bankruptcy, also starred May herself as the awkward botanist-heiress, Henrietta Lowell, who Matthau cynically woos and marries to salvage an extravagant lifestyle. Director May originally submitted a 180-minute work to Paramount, but the studio cut it back by nearly 80 minutes for release. The film has since become a cult classic. Vincent Canby cited the two-reelers of the 1930s and Depression-era screwball comedies when he called it &quot;a beautifully and gently cockeyed movie that recalls at least two different traditions of American film comedy... The entire project is touched by a fine and knowing madness.&quot; May received a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal of the shy botanist in the project from which she fought studio exec Robert Evans, unsuccessfully, to have her name removed.
May quickly followed her debut film with 1972&#x27;s &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;. She limited her role to directing, using a screenplay by Neil Simon, based on a story by Bruce Jay Friedman. The film starred Charles Grodin, Cybill Shepherd, Eddie Albert, and May&#x27;s own daughter, Jeannie Berlin. It was a major critical success, and holds a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2000, it was listed at No. 91 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs list. May followed the two comedies by writing and directing the gangster film &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot;, starring Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. Budgeted at $1.8 million and scheduled for a summer 1975 release, the film cost $4.3 million and was not released until December 1976. May ended up in a legal battle with Paramount Pictures over post-production costs, at one point hiding reels of the film in her husband&#x27;s friend&#x27;s Connecticut garage and later suing the company for $8 million for breach of contract. May worked with Julian Schlossberg to get the rights to the film and released a director&#x27;s cut in 1980. In 2019, May worked with The Criterion Collection to create the newest director&#x27;s cut. The film has gained appreciation by many critics and audiences in recent years.

In Herbert Ross&#x27;s &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978), written by Neil Simon, she was reunited with &quot;A New Leaf&quot; co-star Walter Matthau, playing his wife Millie. In addition to writing three of the films she directed, May received an Oscar nomination for updating the 1941 film &quot;Here Comes Mr. Jordan&quot; as &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978). May reunited with Nichols for a stage production of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; in New Haven in 1980. She contributed (uncredited) to the screenplay for the 1982 megahit &quot;Tootsie&quot;, notably the scenes involving the character played by Bill Murray.

Warren Beatty worked with May on the comedy &quot;Ishtar&quot; (1987), starring Beatty and Dustin Hoffman. Largely shot on location in Morocco, the production was beset by creative differences among the principals and had cost overruns. Long before the picture was ready for release, the troubled production had become the subject of numerous press stories, including a long cover article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine. Some of the opposition to the film came from David Puttnam, the studio head, making &quot;Ishtar&quot; a prime example of studio suicide. The advance publicity was largely negative and, despite some positive reviews from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the film was a box office disaster. The film &quot;Ishtar&quot; has been positively re-evaluated in the 21st century by multiple publications including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, Indiewire, and &quot;The Dissolve&quot;. Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called &quot;Ishtar&quot; a &quot;wrongly maligned masterwork&quot; and raved, &quot;There&#x27;s a level of invention, a depth of reflection, and a tangle of emotions in &quot;Ishtar&quot; which are reached by few films and few filmmakers.&quot;

May acted in the film &quot;In the Spirit&quot; (1990), in which she played a &quot;shopaholic stripped of consumer power&quot;; Robert Pardi has described her portrayal as a &quot;study of fraying equanimity [that] is a classic comic tour de force.&quot; She also contributed to the screenplay for the drama &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; (1995). May reunited with her former comic partner, Mike Nichols, for the 1996 film &quot;The Birdcage&quot;, an American adaptation of the classic French farce &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;. Their film relocated the story from France to South Beach, Miami. It was a major box office hit. May received her second Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay when she again worked with Nichols on the 1998 film &quot;Primary Colors&quot;.

=== 2000–present: Return to acting and Broadway ===
She appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (2000) where she played the character May Sloane, which Allen named after May when he wrote it, and with May being his first choice for the part. For her acting, she won the National Society of Film Critics award for Best Supporting Actress. Allen spoke of her as a genius, and of his ease of working with her: &quot;She shows up on time, she knows her lines, she can ad-lib creatively, and is willing to. If you don&#x27;t want her to, she won&#x27;t. She&#x27;s a dream. She puts herself in your hands. She&#x27;s a genius, and I don&#x27;t use that word casually.&quot; Nearly 15 years later, Allen ended up casting her to play his wife, Kay Munsinger, in his Amazon limited series, &quot;Crisis in Six Scenes&quot;, which was released in 2016.

In 2002, Stanley Donen directed her musical play &quot;Adult Entertainment&quot; with Jeannie Berlin and Danny Aiello at Variety Arts Theater in Manhattan. May wrote the one-act play &quot;George is Dead&quot;, which starred Marlo Thomas and was performed on Broadway from late 2011 into 2012 as part of the anthology play &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot; along with two other plays by Woody Allen and Joel Coen, directed by John Turturro. Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised May&#x27;s entry describing it as &quot;a delicious study in the bliss of narcissism&quot;. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; concurred describing &quot;George is Dead&quot; as the &quot;Strongest entry&quot;. Before he died in 2019, Donen was reported to be in pre-production for a new film, begun December 2013, to be co-written with May and produced by Nichols. A table reading of the script for potential investors included such actors as Christopher Walken, Charles Grodin, Ron Rifkin, and Jeannie Berlin.

When May&#x27;s lifelong collaborator Nichols died in 2014, May stepped up to poignantly direct the 2016 TV documentary &quot;Mike Nichols: American Masters.&quot; That same year, she returned to acting, her first role since 2000, starring alongside her friend Woody Allen in his series &quot;Crisis in Six Scenes&quot; on Amazon Prime, Tim Goodman of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised their chemistry together writing, &quot;The best episodes are the last two, when &quot;Crisis in Six Scenes&quot; becomes a full-blown farce and we get to see Allen and May playing accidental aging radicals, shuffling around Brooklyn&quot;.

In 2018, aged 86, May returned to Broadway after 60 years in a Lila Neugebauer-directed revival of Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s play &quot;The Waverly Gallery&quot; opposite Lucas Hedges, Joan Allen, and Michael Cera. The play ran at the John Golden Theatre, the same theatre where Nichols and May had started out almost 60 years earlier. May received rapturous reviews for her performance as the gregarious, dementia-ridden elderly gallery owner Gladys Green, with many critics remarking that she was giving one of the most extraordinary performances they had ever seen onstage. The show received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play, while May herself won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance. She became the second oldest performer to win a Tony Award for acting. In 2021 she portrayed Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Paramount+ series &quot;The Good Fight&quot;. 

In 2019, it was announced that May is set to direct her first narrative feature in over 30 years. Little is known about the project other than its title, &quot;Crackpot&quot;, and that it is set to star Dakota Johnson, who announced the project at the 2019 Governors Awards. In 2024, Johnson stated that the film is still in development and she serves as the film&#x27;s producer and star with May still set to direct. Sebastian Stan was also attached to co-star, later stating that what was holding up the production was the absence of an insurance director, in case of May&#x27;s inability to complete it.

==Influence and legacy==
Nichols and May created a new &quot;Age of Irony&quot; for comedy, which showed actors arguing contemporary banalities as a key part of their routine. That style of comedy was picked up and further developed by later comics such as Steve Martin, Bill Murray, and David Letterman. According to Martin, Nichols and May were among the first to satirize relationships. The word &quot;relationship,&quot; notes Martin, was first used in the early sixties: &quot;It was the first time I ever heard it satirized.&quot; He recalls that soon after discovering their recorded acts, he went to sleep each night listening to them. &quot;They influenced us all and changed the face of comedy.&quot;

In &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Woody Allen declared, &quot;Individually, each one is a genius, and when they worked together, the sum was even greater than the combination of the parts—the two of them came along and elevated comedy to a brand-new level.&quot;

Lily Tomlin was also affected by their routines and considers May to be her inspiration as a comedian: &quot;There was nothing like Elaine May, with her voice, her timing, and her attitude,&quot; says Tomlin. &quot;The nuances of the characterizations and the cultured types that they were doing completely appealed to me. They were the first people I saw doing smart, hip character pieces. My brother and I used to keep their &#x27;Improvisations to Music&#x27; on the turntable twenty-four hours a day.&quot;

In an interview with Pitchfork Magazine, standup comedian John Mulaney described &quot;Mike Nichols &amp; Elaine May Examine Doctors&quot; (1961) as one of his favorite comedy albums of all time. Mulaney stated, &quot;I got this album for Christmas when I was in junior high. The last track, &#x27;Nichols and May at Work,&#x27; is an outtake from recording the album, they were just improvising dialog in a studio. They’re trying to do a piece where a son goes to his mother and says that he wants to become a registered nurse. It’s something you just have to experience, because two people that funny laughing that hard is really, really, really funny. I think it might be the happiest thing ever recorded.&quot;

Filmmaker and film historian Peter Bogdanovich covered Elaine&#x27;s filmography in his book &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; (1999). Bogdanovich praised all of her films and concluded with &quot;Long live Elaine! Would that she could act and direct again in pictures. In 1998 I saw her perform off-Broadway in a couple of one-act plays she wrote (&quot;Power Plays&quot;), and her performances matched the comic genius of the writing.&quot; Other admirers of May&#x27;s work include comedian Patton Oswalt, and directors Ben and Josh Safdie who both detailed their admiration for her and her work, in particular her film &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot; (1976) through The Criterion Channel.

May&#x27;s work as a director has been given a closer look in recent years with David Hudson, a writer for The Criterion Collection declaring her as a &quot;criminally underappreciated moviemaker&quot;. In 2017 the Philadelphia Film Critics Circle created an award in her name given &quot;to a deserving person or film that brings awareness to women’s issues&quot;.

May&#x27;s life and career are detailed in &quot;Miss May Does Not Exist: The Life and Work of Elaine May, Hollywood’s Hidden Genius&quot; written by Carrie Courogen, which was released in June 2024 by St. Martin&#x27;s Press, and was nominated for the 2024 National Book Critics Circle&#x27;s best first book prize. The book takes its title from May&#x27;s biographical blurb, as it appears on the back of Improvisations to Music.

==Awards and honors==

For her acting in films, May&#x27;s accolades include a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Comedy or Musical for &quot;A New Leaf&quot; (1971), and winning the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;Small Time Crooks&quot; (2000). On stage, May won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance as Gladys in the Broadway revival of Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s &quot;The Waverly Gallery&quot; in 2019. She also received a Drama League Award nomination and won a Drama Desk Award and an Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play. That same year, May&#x27;s film &quot;A New Leaf&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

May was awarded the National Medal of Arts for her lifetime contributions to American comedy by President Barack Obama, in a ceremony in the White House on July 10, 2013. She was awarded for her &quot;groundbreaking wit and a keen understanding of how humor can illuminate our lives, Ms. May has evoked untold joy, challenged expectations, and elevated spirits across our Nation.&quot;

In January 2016, the Writers Guild of America-West announced that May would receive its 2016 Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement at the Writers Guild of America Award ceremony in Los Angeles on February 13.

In 2021, she was chosen to receive the Honorary Academy Award by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, receiving the award for her &quot;bold, uncompromising approach to filmmaking, as a writer, director and actress&quot;. She was honored at the annual Governors Awards alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Liv Ullmann, and Danny Glover on March 25, 2022. Bill Murray presented her with the award crediting her with &quot;saving his life on multiple occasions professionally&quot;.

<text>The Corps des Ingénieurs des Ponts, des Eaux et des Forêts (, in English &quot;Corps of the Engineers of Bridges, Waters and Forests&quot;) is a technical Grand Corps of the French State (grand corps de l&#x27;État). Its members, called &quot;ingénieurs des ponts, des eaux et des forêts&quot; (nicknamed &quot;IPEF&quot;), are senior civil servants and top-level engineers, mainly employed by the French Ministry of Ecological Transition and by the French Ministry of Agriculture, but they can also work for every French Ministries, public establishments, or public compagnies. Thanks to its history and its selective recruitment policy, the &quot;Corps des IPEF&quot; enjoys considerable prestige within France&#x27;s senior civil services, as the &quot;Corps des mines&quot; and the &quot;Corps de l&#x27;armement&quot;.

== Recruitment and training ==
Most of the &quot;IPEF&quot; are recruited from École polytechnique (around 50%), where they are selected based on their final ranking, and there exist several competitive entrance exams for former students from AgroParisTech, from the Écoles normales supérieures, or from other French &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; such as École des ponts ParisTech, CentraleSupélec and École des mines. A special entrance exam was recently opened for PhD holders but it offers a limited number of places. In addition, it is possible for other civil servants to join the &quot;Corps des IPEF&quot; after passing internal exams so as to widen their career perspectives.

People entering the &quot;Corps des IPEF&quot; (around 60 each year) are mostly trained at AgroParisTech and École des ponts ParisTech, but some members also attend formation in specific fields in French or abroad universities. After 1 or 2 years of training including an Executive Master in public affairs, several engineers start a PhD during 3 years in a French laboratory, while the others take their first operational position in the French administration.

Many executive positions in France&#x27;s industries and administration are held by these engineers. Being admitted to the &quot;Corps des IPEF&quot; is still considered a significant fast-track for executive careers.

== Missions ==
According to the &quot;Corps&quot; statutes, every &quot;IPEF&quot; participate, under the authority of the competent ministers, in the design, development, implementation and evaluation of public policies, particularly in areas relating to:

* climate,
* energy demand,
* sustainable regional planning and development,
* housing and urban development,
* transport,
* agricultural and forestry development,
* management and preservation of natural land and maritime areas and resources,
* food and agro-industry.

They may perform management, supervisory, monitoring, inspection, study, expert appraisal, public policy evaluation, teaching and research functions, including in international organizations.

In particular, they can be in charge of research and teaching activities in these areas. In this case, they are assimilated as permanent researchers.

== Organization and structure ==
The C&quot;orps&quot; is led by the &quot;chef de corps&quot; (&quot;chief of corps&quot;). All members are divided into 3 grades, corresponding to career advancement and levels of responsibility:

* &quot;ingénieur&quot; (&quot;engineer&quot;)
* &quot;ingénieur en chef&quot; (&quot;chief engineer&quot;)
* &quot;ingénieur général&quot; (&quot;general engineer&quot;)

There also exist a temporary grade for newly recruited engineers still in training: &quot;ingénieur-élève&quot; (&quot;engineer-student&quot;).

== History ==
The &quot;Corps des IPEF&quot; results of the merger in 2009 of two &quot;Grands Corps&quot;, namely the Corps des Ingénieurs des Ponts et Chaussées (IPC) (in English &quot;Corps of the engineers of Bridges and Roads&quot;) and the Corps des Ingénieurs du Génie rural, des Eaux et des Forêts (IGREF) (in English &quot;Corps of the engineers of Rural Engineering, Waters and Forests&quot;). They used to recruit their members in École polytechnique, AgroParisTech and École des ponts ParisTech.

Even before, the &quot;Corps des IPC&quot; absorbed several formers &quot;Corps&quot; including civil aviation engineers, geography engineers and meteorological engineers, while the &quot;Corps des IGREF&quot; absorbed the &quot;Corps&quot; of the engineers of rural engineering and the &quot;Corps&quot; of the engineers of waters and forests.

<doc id="574399" wikidata="Q1645436" url="?curid=574399" title="Tonka">
<text>Tonka is an American brand and former manufacturer of toy trucks. The company was founded in 1946 and operated as an independent manufacturer of popular steel toy construction type trucks and machinery, until its sale to Hasbro in 1991.

== History ==
Tonka began as &quot;Mound Metalcraft&quot;, a gardening tools company, in the fall of 1946 in Mound, Minnesota. Lynn Everett Baker (1898–1964), Avery F. Crounse, and Alvin F. Tesch created the company in an old schoolhouse. Their building&#x27;s former occupant, the Streater Company, had made and patented several toys, including toy trucks. E. C. Streater was not interested in the toy business so they approached Mound Metalcraft. The three men at Mound Metalcraft thought they might make a good sideline to their other products.

After some modifications to the design by Alvin Tesch and the addition of a new logo created by Erling Eklof, the company began selling metal toys, which soon became the primary business. The logo was based on a University of Minnesota drafting student&#x27;s sketch by Donald B. Olson, who later became the company&#x27;s Chief Industrial Engineer. The logo used the Dakota Sioux word &quot;tanka&quot;, which means &quot;great&quot; or &quot;big&quot;.

In November 1955, Mound Metalcraft changed its name to &quot;Tonka Toys Incorporated&quot;. From 1947 to 1957, their logo was an oval, showing the Tonka Toys name in red above blue ocean waves with seagulls overhead, honoring nearby Lake Minnetonka.

From 1958 to 1961, the logo no longer included seagulls and the colors were changed to white, grey, and red. The colors changed to red and gold in 1963. In 1978, the oval was removed and the company began using only the name Tonka on their toys.

In 1964, Tonka acquired the Mell Manufacturing Company in Chicago, Illinois, allowing it to produce barbecue grills, eventually under the &quot;Tonka Firebowl&quot; label.

In 1968, Tonka moved company headquarters from Mound to Minneapolis.

In 1987, Tonka purchased Kenner Parker, including UK toy giant Palitoy, for $555 million, borrowing extensively to fund the acquisition. However, the cost of servicing the debt meant Tonka itself had to find a buyer and it was eventually acquired by Hasbro in 1991, its headquarters moved out of Minnesota, and relocated its manufacturing operations to Hasbro&#x27;s facilities in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In 1998, Hasbro began a licensing deal with Funrise Toys to manufacture and distribute Tonka trucks. The deal began with versions of the trucks fitted with electronics for lights and sounds, but grew to encompass the entire brand. This agreement ended on July 4, 2019, with the license being transferred to Basic Fun!, which produces other brands such as Care Bears, My Little Pony, and Lincoln Logs. Maisto International, which makes die-cast vehicles, acquired the rights to use the Tonka name in a line of 1:64 scale, featuring mostly trucks.

In 2024, Basic Fun filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company will use bankruptcy proceedings to repay its creditors while remaining in operation.

== Products ==

Tonka has produced a variety of toys, including dolls (&quot;Star Fairies&quot;, &quot;Bathing Beauties&quot;, &quot;Maple Town&quot;, and &quot;Hollywoods&quot;). They have produced other toys, some aimed at girls (such as &quot;Keypers&quot;), and others aimed at boys (such as &quot;Gobots&quot;, &quot;Supernaturals&quot;, &quot;Rock Lords&quot;, &quot;Spiral Zone&quot;, &quot;Legions of Power&quot; and &quot;Steel Monsters&quot;). It was the original manufacturer of the Pound Puppies toy line, and in the late 1980s licensed products inspired by &quot;Maple Town&quot;.

Tonka produced video games as Tonka Video Games, including &quot;Tonka Raceway&quot;, and purchased the rights to distribute and market the Master System after Sega of America stopped competing against the Nintendo Entertainment System in the US. However, the Master System&#x27;s market share declined, since Tonka did not have experience with video games or how to market them. Hasbro sold the digital gaming rights for various properties (including &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Tonka, Playskool, and &quot;Transformers&quot;) to Infogrames (later known and currently operating as Atari SA) for US$100 million in 2000, buying back the rights for US$65 million in June 2005.

In 2001, Tonka trucks were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York. The Winifred Museum in Winifred, Montana, has a collection of more than 3,000 Tonka toys.
In 2002, Ford made its very first partnership with Tonka with the Mighty F-350 concept.

=== Computer and video games ===
Thirteen video games based on the toys were released between 1996 and 2006. A majority of these titles were released by Hasbro Interactive and its later re-brandings as Infogrames Interactive and Atari Interactive, although a small number of titles for Nintendo platforms were released by TDK Mediactive under a sub-licensing agreement from Infogrames.
