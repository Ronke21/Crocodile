<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards are honors given out annually by &quot;Billboard&quot;, a publication covering the music business and a music popularity chart. The &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards show has been held annually since 1990, with the exception of the years 2007 through 2010. The event was previously staged in December, but has been held in May since returning in 2011. On October 19, 2023, it was announced that the award ceremony will be reformatted as a digital-only show and move from broadcast television to its website and &quot;Billboard&quot;″s social media pages, starting with the 2023 edition on November 19.

==Awards process==
Unlike other awards, such as the Grammy Award, which determine nominations as a result of the highest votes received by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards finalists are based on album and digital songs sales, streaming, radio airplay, touring, and social engagement. These measurements are tracked year-round by &quot;Billboard&quot; and its data partners, including MRC Data and Next Big Sound. The 2018 awards were based on the reporting period of April 8, 2017 through March 31, 2018. Awards are given for the top album, artist and single in a number of different music genres.

==Categories==
From 1990 to 2006, the show had the same categories and category names every year. In 2011, for the first time, all of the awards were renamed to &quot;Top [award title]&quot;. The &quot;of the year&quot; portion of each category title no longer exists, and many of the awards have been further renamed. Other awards, including both &quot;crossover&quot; awards (No. 1 Classical Crossover Artist and No. 1 Classical Crossover Album) were discontinued. As of 2024, there are three fan-voted categories.

==Performances==
==Broadcast==
Since its inception (created by Rick Garson, Paul Flattery &amp; Jim Yukich), the BMAs had been telecast on the Fox network; however due to contractual expirations and other unforeseen circumstances, the awards were cancelled for 2007. Plans for a new version of the BMAs in 2008 (in association with AEG Live) fell through and were not held until 2011.

On February 17, 2011, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that the BMAs would return to television, moving from its original home on Fox to its new network, ABC, on May 22. A new award statuette was created by New York firm Society Awards. Dick Clark Productions, which is co-owned with &quot;Billboard&quot;, began producing the ceremony in 2014. On November 28, 2017, it was announced that the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards would move from ABC to NBC beginning in 2018 under a multi-year contract.

The 2020 ceremony, originally scheduled for April 29, was postponed indefinitely on March 17 due to coronavirus-related public assembly concerns. On August 14, 2020, it was announced that the 2020 ceremony had been rescheduled to October 14.

On November 25, 2024, it was announced that the BMAs will return to Fox with a pre-recorded special on December 12. It will also stream live on Amazon Fire TV Channels and on-demand on Paramount+.

<text>A choc ice (British English) or ice cream bar (American English) is a frozen dessert generally consisting of a rectangular block of ice cream—typically vanilla flavour—which is thinly coated with chocolate. Related products may also include other fillings with the ice cream and be styled similar to candy bars. The term has also been used as a racial slur.

== Description ==
A choc ice is a generic frozen dessert generally consisting of a rectangular block of ice cream—typically vanilla flavour—which is thinly coated with chocolate.

== History ==

Ice cream enrobed in chocolate was invented in the 1920s. Confectioner Harry Burt invented the chocolate-enrobed ice cream on a stick in 1920, and was granted a patent in 1923. In 1921, the Eskimo Pie chocolate bar was invented in Iowa by a pharmacy owner named Chris Nelson, who was inspired by a boy named Douglas Ressenden who could not decide between candy and ice cream; a patent was awarded in 1922, but invalidated in 1928. The Klondike bar was also invented in 1922.

== Brands ==
In many countries, there are numerous versions of this dessert which are produced under many different brand names.

A notable American brand is Klondike, which introduced its Klondike bar in the United States in 1922. Related products include frozen confections that enrobe fillings with the ice cream and appear similar to candy bars (e.g., Snickers ice cream bars).

== Racial slur ==
The term &quot;choc ice&quot; has also become a racial slur used to describe any person who is figuratively &quot;black on the outside, white on the inside&quot;.

<doc id="566115" wikidata="Q3726284" url="?curid=566115" title="Tawny-flanked prinia">
<text>The tawny-flanked prinia (Prinia subflava) is a small passerine bird belonging to the genus &quot;Prinia&quot; in the family Cisticolidae, a family of Old World warblers. It is widespread and common in most parts of Africa south of the Sahara. The plain prinia (&quot;P. inornata&quot;) of southern Asia was formerly included in this species but is now usually considered to be a separate species.

==Taxonomy==
The tawny-flanked prinia was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the wagtails in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla subflava&quot;. The specific epithet combines the Latin &quot;sub&quot; meaning &quot;beneath&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; with &quot;flavus&quot; meaning &quot;yellow&quot;. Gmelin based his account on a hand coloured engraving by François-Nicolas Martinet that was published to accompany the Comte de Buffon&#x27;s multi-volume work, the &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. The tawny-flanked prinia is now one of 30 species placed in the genus &quot;Prinia&quot; that was introduced by the American naturalist Thomas Horsfield in 1821.

Ten subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. s. subflava&quot; — south Mauritania and Senegal to central Ethiopia and north Uganda
* &quot;P. s. pallescens&quot; — north Mali to northwest Eritrea and north Ethiopia
* &quot;P. s. tenella&quot; — south Somalia, east Kenya and east Tanzania
* &quot;P. s. melanorhyncha&quot; — Sierra Leone to south Uganda, central Kenya and northwest Tanzania
* &quot;P. s. graueri&quot; — central Angola, south, east DR Congo and Rwanda
* &quot;P. s. affinis&quot; — southeast DR Congo and southwest Tanzania to northeast South Africa
* &quot;P. s. kasokae&quot; — east Angola and west Zambia
* &quot;P. s. mutatrix&quot; — south Tanzania to east Zimbabwe and central Mozambique
* &quot;P. s. bechuanae&quot; — southwest Angola and north Namibia to northwest Zimbabwe
* &quot;P. s. pondoensis&quot; — south Mozambique and east South Africa

==Description==

The tawny-flanked prinia is in length with a long, narrow, graduated tail and a fairly long, slender bill. The tail is often held erect or waved from side to side. The upperparts are grey-brown with rufous-brown edges to the flight feathers and a rufous tinge to the rump. The throat and breast are whitish while the flanks and vent are warm buff. There is a whitish stripe over the eye and the lores are dark. The tail feathers have a white tip and a dark subterminal band.

The sexes are similar in appearance. Non-breeding birds have a longer tail than breeding birds. Juveniles have pale yellow underparts and a yellowish bill. There are many recognised subspecies.

The call is short, wheezy and rapidly repeated. The song is a monotonous series of shrill notes. The male often sings from an exposed perch.

The pale prinia (&quot;P. somalica&quot;) of North-east Africa is similar but paler and greyer with whitish flanks. It inhabits drier, more open habitats than the tawny-flanked prinia. The river prinia (&quot;P. fluviatilis&quot;) of West Africa is also paler and greyer and has a longer tail. It is restricted to waterside vegetation.

==Distribution and habitat==
There are ten subspecies distributed across most parts of sub-Saharan Africa except for the driest and wettest areas. It is absent from much of the Congo Basin, southern Namibia, south-west Botswana and the western half of South Africa. It is found amongst shrubs and grass in a variety of habitats including woodland, savanna and cultivated areas. It adapts well to man-made habitats and is not considered to be threatened.

==Behaviour==
It feeds on insects and other invertebrates. It forages in small flocks which move through shrubs and undergrowth.

The nest is purse-shaped and made of strips of grass woven together. It is built one to two metres above the ground. Two to four eggs are laid; they are variable in ground colour and usually have brown or purple spots or blotches.

<text>In philately, a ship cover is a cover that was mailed aboard a ship, while a naval cover is one posted on a navy vessel. Shipboard postal facilities are ubiquitous on ships of any size, although the &quot;post office&quot; may consist only of an alcove and a sailor working it part-time.

Ship covers usually carry a paquebot postmark and/or a postmark unique to the vessel. Collectors of ship covers will look for different types used at different periods, as well as for covers indicating routing through particular ports, and so forth.

The Universal Ship Cancellation Society, founded in 1932, specializes in the study of naval covers, particularly those of the US Navy.

<doc id="566125" wikidata="Q7766944" url="?curid=566125" title="The Stranger (film series)">
<text>The Stranger is a series of direct-to-video (and audio CD) science-fiction dramas produced by BBV and starring Colin Baker. They are now available on DVD.

The series began in 1991 with &quot;Summoned by Shadows&quot;, co-produced with the BBC Film Club as a knowing homage to the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (of which BBV founder Bill Baggs was a fan) and in a pragmatic attempt to take advantage of the consequent pre-existing audience. &quot;Summoned by Shadows&quot; is a &quot;Who&quot;-style tale of strange doings in an unspecified time period on Earth featuring three actors known for their roles in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and playing similar characters. The unnamed protagonist (listed in the credits as &quot;The Stranger&quot;) is played by Colin Baker, his assistant Miss Brown by Nicola Bryant, who had played the Doctor&#x27;s assistant Peri Brown opposite Colin Baker for two years, and the villain of the piece by Michael Wisher, who had been the first actor to play Davros.

The second story, &quot;More than a Messiah&quot;, adapted the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Audio Visuals story of the same name, but with the Stranger and Miss Brown substituted for the Doctor and companion Ria (who was modelled after Peri). In a further connection, it co-starred Sophie Aldred, better known as Ace from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and Peter Miles, who had co-starred (opposite Wisher) in the TV serial &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; – both in completely different roles.

&quot;In Memory Alone&quot;, the third film, found the Stranger and Miss Brown stranded without their mysterious transport (never seen) in a desolate train station with amnesia, and battling a robot and a mysterious man played by Nicholas Briggs (who also wrote the film along with others in the &quot;Stranger&quot; series). Most releases of this film (including VHS) include a behind-the-scenes featurette and a blooper reel.

While the first three may be (and often were) taken as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; by another name, the departure of the Miss Brown character (for which Nicola Bryant does not speak with Peri Brown&#x27;s American accent) and the Stranger himself being likewise &quot;returned to his proper time and place&quot; at the story&#x27;s conclusion allowed for a move to clarify &quot;The Stranger&quot;&#x27;s status as separate work of fiction and developed an identity of its own.

The adventures of the Stranger ran in all to six videos (and four audio dramas, although the second audio drama was much the same as the sixth video).

==History of the Stranger==
In a pan-dimensional area referred to as the &quot;Dimensional Web&quot;, there exist two races: the Protectorate, which are currently dominant and in charge, and the Preceptors, apparently defeated by the Protectorate. The Preceptors act by taking on corporeal forms within the material universe and carry out random acts of violence, terrorism and assassination in an effort to strike back at their oppressors (although it is never truly determined which race is in the right and which is in the wrong), usually in teams of two or three. One such Preceptor cell is headed by Solomon, considered one of the top Preceptor leaders. His second-in-command and partner is Egan (played by David Troughton) and the third member of the team is a relative newcomer named Saul (John Wadmore). Solomon and Egan have worked together for a long time and therefore have complete faith in one another.

However, one mission, while accomplishing the objective (the assassination of an unimportant female caterer), ends in disaster with Solomon being captured by the Protectorate and Egan and Saul managing to escape. Since the Protectorate no longer believe in execution (their own past is too bloody for that) and incarceration would be a drain on their resources, Solomon is selected to be the first to undergo a new process – the Estrangement Programme, in which the prejudices of the subject are &quot;extracted&quot; by a form of mental block or conditioning and wiping out all past memories of the subject&#x27;s &quot;crimes&quot; (the Protectorate state emphatically that this is &quot;not&quot; brainwashing).

&quot;Note: In the audio adventure &quot;The Last Mission&quot;, it is revealed that during the above mission Solomon was captured by the planet&#x27;s local security force, but the officer in charge (Elisabeth Sladen) turned out to be a Protectorate agent who had set a trap for all three Preceptors. While Solomon was in her custody, she offered Solomon a deal in which, in return for her allowing the Preceptors to accomplish their mission and Egan and Saul&#x27;s escape, Solomon would surrender himself to the Protectorate and undergo the then-experimental Estrangement Programme. Believing that his beliefs were not prejudices and that the program would not affect him, he agreed, never revealing the bargain to Egan and Saul.&quot;

After Solomon undergoes the procedure, he is assigned a Protectorate observer who also acts as a companion, Miss Brown (Nicola Bryant), and begins his new life as the Doctor-like &quot;Stranger&quot;. However, in the adventure &quot;In Memory Alone&quot;, the Stranger, while suffering from amnesia and in order to defeat a malfunctioning combat suit, is forced to hook up his own brain to a computer system, and the resulting shock causes the mental conditioning to be disrupted. The Stranger arrives in England on Earth in &quot;The Terror Game&quot; still suffering from amnesia, but runs into Egan and Saul (who now believe that the Stranger, now identified as &quot;Solomon&quot;, may have turned traitor) and Tamora Hennessay (Louise Jameson).

After Tamora reveals herself to be another Protectorate agent, Solomon escapes and goes into hiding under the name of &quot;Preston Richards&quot; while slowly recovering his lost memories and trying to learn whether or not he&#x27;s still being affected by the Estrangement Programme. In the adventure &quot;Breach of the Peace&quot;, Egan and Saul, using the identities of Metropolitan Police detectives, track Solomon down and force him to take them back into the Web, but Metaphysic, a heavily guarded research project where an experiment in psychokinesis is being conducted by a Dr Hunter (Geoffrey Beevers) on a talented girl named Meta (Bernadette Gepheart), causes a tear in the Web that drags Solomon, Egan and Saul back to England (&quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;) and forces them to intervene when Hunter&#x27;s experiment goes out of control.

==Video series==

Another BBV production, &quot;The Airzone Solution&quot;, is sometimes erroneously listed as part of the &quot;Stranger&quot; series. In fact, it is a standalone &quot;ecological thriller&quot; film that, other than its cast, has no connection to either the Stranger or &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Audio series==

&quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; is the basis for the video &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, and while having the same basic plotline trims down the number of parts/actors, changes certain events and has a different ending with Meta deliberately sacrificing herself to save Solomon, Egan and Saul (whereas in the video Solomon is forced to kill Meta at her own request to save himself and Egan).

<text>Robert Beaven (January 20, 1836 – September 18, 1920), son of James Beaven, was a British Columbia politician and businessman. Beaven moved to British Columbia from Toronto, where he had been educated at Upper Canada College, because of the gold rush. He entered business in Victoria, which was then the capital of the Colony of Vancouver Island. After the colony&#x27;s union with British Columbia, Beaven became involved with politics as secretary of Amor De Cosmos&#x27; Confederation League which advocated that the colony enter Canadian Confederation.

Beaven was elected to the provincial legislature in 1871, the year of union with Canada, and served in the cabinets of De Cosmos and his successor George Anthony Walkem as chief commissioner of land and works. He was accused by the opposition of corruption and was criticised for not opening up land for settlement quickly enough as well as running up the deficit. Beaven was in opposition during the government of Andrew Charles Elliott but rejoined the government when Walkem became premier for a second time in 1878 and became minister of finance and agriculture. Due to a shortage of revenues he instituted a poll tax in 1881. In 1882 Beaven became premier of the province but many of his supporters were defeated in the subsequent July election and Beaven ruled with a minority.

As Premier he hosted the three-month visit to British Columbia of the Governor General of Canada, the Marquess of Lorne, and his wife Princess Louise, offering to make the princess Queen of Vancouver Island. She declined.

In January 1883 Beaven attempted to introduce a legislative program but his government was brought down by a Motion of No Confidence and he resigned on January 29, 1883.

Beaven remained an MLA and leader of the opposition until 1894 when he lost his seat in an election after having served in the legislature for twenty-three years. He also served three terms as mayor of Victoria, British Columbia in the 1890s.

Following the 1898 election, no party had a majority and the lieutenant-governor Thomas Robert McInnes passed over the former premier John Herbert Turner and asked Beaven to form a government despite the fact that he had been out of the legislature for four years. Leading members of the legislature refused to support Beaven and he was unable to form a cabinet.

Robert Beaven died in 1920 and was interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria.

<text>The Stranger is an alternative news and commentary publication in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1991 by Tim Keck and cartoonist James Sturm, it has a progressive orientation. The paper&#x27;s principal competitor was the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; until 2019 when the &quot;Weekly&quot; ceased print publication. Originally published weekly, &quot;The Stranger&quot; became biweekly in 2017 and suspended print publication during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, resuming publication of a quarterly arts magazine in March 2023. It also publishes online content.

==History==
&quot;The Stranger&quot; was founded in July 1991 by Tim Keck, who had previously co-founded the satirical newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot;, and cartoonist James Sturm. Its first issue was produced out of a home in Seattle&#x27;s Wallingford neighborhood and was released on September 23, 1991. The newspaper&#x27;s title reflected the fact that Keck had almost no connection to Seattle prior to launching the paper. In 1993, &quot;The Stranger&quot; relocated to Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill district, where its offices remained until 2020. &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s&quot; tagline is &quot;Seattle&#x27;s Only Newspaper&quot; (a characterization alluding to its local ownership).

In its early days, &quot;The Stranger&quot; had a print run of 20,000, and focused on Seattle&#x27;s University District. It was originally distributed as a single sheet of newsprint wrapped around a wad of coupons redeemable at local businesses.

Dan Savage was the &quot;Stranger&quot; editor-in-chief from April 4, 2001, to September 2007. Associated with the paper since its inception, he made a national reputation writing the paper&#x27;s sarcastic and sometimes inflammatory sex advice column, &quot;Savage Love&quot;, which has since appeared in every issue of &quot;The Stranger&quot;. Savage became the paper&#x27;s editorial director in 2007, and was replaced as editor-in-chief by Christopher Frizzelle at that time.

Journalist Charles Mudede, current senior staff writer and former associate editor, had his weekly &quot;Police Beat&quot; column loosely adapted into a film of the same name, directed by its co-writer, Robinson Devor. It received mostly positive reviews, and was released in American cinemas in 2006. Mudede would continue collaborating with Devor on future projects, such as the documentary &quot;Zoo&quot; (2007).

Erica C. Barnett, who was an early news editor for the paper, was named reporter of the year in 2007 by Seattle&#x27;s Municipal League. 

On April 16, 2012, &quot;The Stranger&quot; won a Pulitzer Prize in the &quot;feature writing&quot; category, for &quot;The Bravest Woman in Seattle&quot;, by Eli Sanders described as &quot;a haunting story of a woman who survived a brutal attack that took the life of her partner, using the woman&#x27;s brave courtroom testimony and the details of the crime to construct a moving narrative&quot;. The feature appeared in the June 15, 2011, edition. In 2014, columnist Jen Graves was a Pulitzer finalist for her criticism columns.

From at least 2013 until July 2024, &quot;The Stranger&quot; was owned by the Seattle-based Index Newspapers; it has been described as distinguishing itself from the &quot;Weekly&quot; by its continuous local ownership (as the &quot;Weekly&quot; has had non-local ownership since 1997). By 2015, the influence of the paper&#x27;s endorsements in local elections, which reflect a left-leaning perspective was being felt.

&quot;The Stranger&quot; made the transition to a biweekly format with its September 27, 2017, issue. It was redesigned to include longer feature stories and printed on heavier paper stock similar to magazines. The paper was distributed to local businesses, newsstands, and newspaper boxes free of charge every other Wednesday. The offices of &quot;The Stranger&quot; moved from Capitol Hill to Seattle&#x27;s Chinatown–International District in 2020.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 13, 2020, &quot;The Stranger&quot; announced that, due to a dramatic decrease in income from loss of advertising revenue, it would suspend its print edition. COVID-19 triggered &quot;The Stranger&quot; to lay off eighteen of its employees, which reduced its writing department. A successful online fundraiser was then organized to keep &quot;The Stranger&quot; afloat. Printing resumed in March 2023 with a quarterly arts magazine, while regular editions remain suspended.

In July 2024, the paper and the related &quot;Portland Mercury&quot; were sold by Index Media to Noisy Creek, a Seattle-headquartered media company founded by former &quot;Grist&quot; CEO and state legislator Brady Walkinshaw. Index Media retained a 20 percent stake in the newspaper, while Walkinshaw had the largest share of the &quot;about 20&quot; individual investors in Noisy Creek. Former &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Hannah Murphy Winter was named editor in chief.

The purchase of The Stranger by Noisy Creek was followed by the ouster of longtime news editor Rich Smith in October 2024, who was replaced by interim news editor Marcus Harrison Green, former Seattle times columnist and founder of the independent South Seattle Emerald.

==Awards programs==
Since 2003, in association with the cigarette company Lucky Strike, and later the antismoking arts organization Art Patch, the newspaper has awarded the annual Stranger Genius Awards to four Seattle-area individuals and one Seattle-area arts organization. Besides the recognition, each winner receives a $5000 cash award and a cake. Winners of the award include the filmmaker James Longley, the filmmaker Lynn Shelton, the writer Sherman Alexie, the poet Heather McHugh, the actress Sarah Rudinoff, the experimental-theater collective Implied Violence, Strawberry Theatre Workshop, the artist Jeffry Mitchell, and the artist Wynne Greenwood. A party and rock show for the winners is held every fall; past Stranger Genius Award parties have been held at the downtown public library, Seattle Art Museum, and the Moore Theater.

===January===
* The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff begin to consider how to create a transportation system in the China-Burma-India Theater, primarily involving transport aircraft.
* Lieutenant Ivan Chisov of the Soviet Air Force miraculously survives a fall from without a parachute after departing a heavily damaged Ilyushin Il-4 twin-engined medium bomber. After achieving a terminal velocity of about , he is decelerated when he hits the lip of a snow-covered ravine, sliding down with decreasing speed until he stops at the bottom, suffering a broken pelvis and severe spinal injuries.
* The Soviet Union parachutes 2,000 troops behind German lines at Medyn, near Tula, in support of Soviet Army offensive operations.
* January 4–7 – Soviet Air Force aircraft attack forward &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; airfields at Rzhev and Velikiye Luki while German transport aircraft are using them to resupply German ground units.

* January 6
**Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft based at Truk begin attacks on the Australian air base at Rabaul.
**The first phase of the 1941–42 winter Soviet counter-offensive comes to an end after 33 days.

* January 13 – Heinkel test pilot Helmut Schenk becomes the first person to escape from a stricken aircraft with an ejection seat after the control surfaces of the first prototype He 280 V1 ice up and become inoperable. The fighter, being used in tests of the Argus As 014 pulsejets for Fieseler Fi 103 cruise missile development, had had its regular HeS 8A turbojets removed, and had been towed aloft from the &quot;Erprobungstelle Rechlin&quot; central test facility in Germany by a pair of Messerschmitt Bf 110C tugs in a heavy snow-shower. At , Schenk finds he has no control, jettisons his towline, and ejects.

===February===
* The United States Army Air Forces redesignate various organizations as the Fifth (in the Far East), Sixth (in the Panama Canal Zone), Seventh (in the Territory of Hawaii), and Eleventh (in the Territory of Alaska) Air Forces.
* The Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces, Henry H. Arnold, tells President Franklin D. Roosevelt that an air cargo route between India and China should be established to make up for the likely imminent loss of Rangoon, Burma, to Japanese forces. Roosevelt orders Arnold to commandeer 25 civilian Douglas DC-3s to begin the airlift.
* Royal Air Force Bomber Command begins using &quot;Shaker&quot; – long-burning flares – to illuminate targets for its aircraft.
* The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II greatly intensifies its bombing campaign against Malta.
* February 1 – The U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and launch air strikes against Japanese bases in the Marshall Islands. It is the first offensive operation by American forces in World War II.

* February 11–13 – 250 Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters and 30 Messerschmitt Bf 110 night fighters participate in Operation Thunderbolt, the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s defense of the battlecruisers &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and heavy cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; as they make the &quot;Channel Dash&quot; (Operation Cerberus) from Brest, France, to Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbüttel, Germany, via the English Channel and Strait of Dover. On February 12, six Fleet Air Arm Fairey Swordfish – all of which are shot down; their commander, Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde receives a posthumous Victoria Cross for the attack – and some Royal Air Force Coastal Command Bristol Beauforts attempt torpedo attacks, but score no hits.
* February 12
**The U.S. Army Air Forces activate the Tenth Air Force for service in China, Burma, and India.
**German dive bombers sink the British destroyer at Malta.
* February 13 – One hundred Japanese aircraft drop 700 Japanese paratroopers onto Palembang on Sumatra.
* February 19 – Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft conduct a devastating raid on Darwin, Australia, where 45 ships are in the harbor. Known as the &quot;Great Darwin Raid,&quot; it is both the first and the largest air attack in history against Australian territory. A first wave of 188 Mitsubishi A6M (Allied reporting name &quot;Zero&quot;) fighters, Aichi D3A1 (Allied reporting name &quot;Val&quot;) dive bombers, and Nakajima B5N2 (Allied reporting name &quot;Kate&quot;) torpedo bombers from the aircraft carriers &quot;Akagi&quot;, &quot;Kaga&quot;, &quot;Hiryū&quot;, and &quot;Sōryū&quot; is followed by a second wave of 54 land-based Mitsubishi G3M2 (Allied reporting name &quot;Nell&quot;) and Mitsubishi G4M1 (Allied reporting name &quot;Betty&quot;) bombers. Allied losses in the raid are eight ships sunk (including the U.S. Navy destroyer ), three ships run aground, 25 ships damaged (including the hospital ship &quot;Manunda&quot;), 30 aircraft destroyed, 310 people killed, and 400 people wounded; Japanese bombs also destroy the town″s hospital and damage its post office, and the explosion of the docked cargo ship &quot;Neptuna&quot; – loaded with ammunition – virtually destroys the harbor″s facilities and sets fire to several large oil-storage tanks. In exchange, the Japanese lose three Vals, one Zero, two men killed, and one man captured. Flying a Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Lieutenant Robert Oestreicher shoots down two Vals, while Zeroes shoot down four other USAAF P-40Es; the six downed aircraft are the first confirmed aerial victories ever to occur over Australia. Although Japanese carrier aircraft never strike Darwin again, Japanese land-based aircraft will bomb the town 63 more times, the last raid taking place in mid-November 1943.
* February 20 – The first combat between carrier-type aircraft of the Japanese and U.S. navies takes place between Rabaul-based Japanese aircraft and fighters from the aircraft carrier north of the Solomon Islands. The Americans lose two planes and one pilot, but claim to have shot down most of the 18 Japanese attackers; Lieutenant Edward H. &quot;Butch&quot; O&#x27;Hare shoots down five bombers to become the second U.S. Navy ace and the first in World War II.
* February 21 – Air Marshal Arthur T. Harris assumes command of RAF Bomber Command. Known to the press as &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, he will command Bomber Command for the remainder of World War II.
* February 26 – First Intercontinental Division (ICD) flight, with ex-TWA Boeing 307 Stratoliners in USAAF service, but manned by civilian TWA crews, beginning the transatlantic passenger and critical cargo aerial ferry service between North American and Europe. 
* February 26–27 (overnight) – 49 British bombers attack Kiel, Germany, with the loss of three aircraft. They score two hits on the German battlecruiser &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, killing 116 of her crew and damaging her so badly that she never is seaworthy again.
* February 27 – The aircraft tender USS &quot;Langley&quot; (AV-3), which once had been the U.S. Navy″s first aircraft carrier as , is sunk by Japanese aircraft in the Indian Ocean while trying to deliver Curtiss P-40 fighters from Australia to Java.
* February 28 – Since February 1, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II has flown 2,497 sorties against Malta, including 222 attacks against airfields alone.

===March===
* The Soviet Union redesignates the Ilyushin DB-3F as the Ilyushin Il-4.
* March 1 – The U.S. Navy sinks a German submarine for the first time in World War II when a Patrol Squadron 82 (VP-82) Lockheed PBO-1 Hudson piloted by Ensign William Tepuni USNR sinks &quot;U-656&quot; off Cape Race, Newfoundland.
* March 3 – Three Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters shoot down the KNILM Douglas DC-3 airliner &quot;Pelikaan&quot; (tail number PK-AFV) as it approaches Broome, Australia, forcing it to make a belly landing in shallow surf at Carnot Bay, then strafe it, killing or seriously injuring four of the 12 people on board. A Japanese Kawanishi H6K (Allied reporting name &quot;Mavis&quot;) flying boat bombs the wreckage the following day. A shipment of diamonds worth A£150,000 to A£300,000 aboard the plane disappears, apparently stolen.
* March 3–4 (overnight) – 235 British bombers – the largest number sent against a single target to date – attack the Renault vehicle factory at Boulogne-Billancourt in Paris in an attempt at night precision bombing. Three-quarters of the bombs hit the factory, but 367 French civilians are killed and 10,000 rendered homeless by errant bombs. The death toll in fact is greater than in any single attack on a German city thus far in the war.
* March 4 – Aircraft from the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier raid Japanese bases on Marcus Island.
* March 4–5 (overnight) – Two Imperial Japanese Navy Kawanishi H8K (Allied reporting name &quot;Emily&quot;) flying boats fly from Wotje, refuel from a submarine at French Frigate Shoals, and fly on to bomb Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands, returning safely. The mission is unsuccessful because of heavy cloud cover in the Honolulu area. It is the first combat flight of the H8K.
* March 5 – The Civil Air Patrol begins maritime patrols off the United States East Coast.
* March 7 – The Royal Air Force commits Supermarine Spitfires to the defense of Malta for the first time, flying 15 of them to the island from the aircraft carriers and .
* March 8–9 (overnight) through 10-11 (overnight) – Royal Air Force Bomber Command bombs Essen, Germany, on three consecutive nights with 211, 187, and 126 aircraft respectively, losing a combined total of 16 bombers. The raids are the combat debut of the Gee navigation aid, raising British hopes that precision bombing of the Krupp armaments factory will be achieved, but it is not hit, and bombs in fact do far more damage to neighboring towns than to Essen itself. The third raid includes two Avro Lancasters, the first use of the Lancaster against a German target.
* March 9
**Twelve Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier attack the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; while she is at sea off Norway. They score no hits, and &quot;Tirpitz&quot; shoots down two Albacores. It is the only time that Allied forces attack &quot;Tirpitz&quot; while she is in the open sea.
**The United States Army Air Forces are reorganized, with the separate Air Force Combat Command (the combat element) and United States Army Air Corps (the logistics and training element) discontinued. General Henry H. Arnold, formerly Chief of the Army Air Forces, becomes Commanding General of Army Air Forces. The term &quot;Air Corps&quot; survives until 1947, but only as a reference to the aviation branch of service of the United States Army without indicating any formal organization.
**The U.S. Navy commissions Air Transport Squadron 1 (VR-1), the first of 13 squadrons it will establish for the Naval Air Transport Service during World War II, at Norfolk, Virginia.
* March 10 – The U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and launch a 104-aircraft raid from south of New Guinea and over the Owen Stanley Mountains via a 7,500-foot (2,286-meter) pass to strike Japanese shipping off Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea.
* March 12–13 (overnight) – 68 British Vickers Wellington bombers raid Kiel, Germany, losing five of their number.
* March 20 – The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II further escalates its bombing campaign against Malta as truly massive air raids begin with a goal of forcing the island″s antiaircraft artillery to exhaust its ammunition and personnel, followed by large attacks on airfields and aircraft on the ground, and finally the destruction of naval forces, dockyards, and other military installations.
* March 21 – HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; makes the second delivery of Spitfires to Malta, flying off nine.

Early in the morning, a 56-plane strike from &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; sinks a destroyer and fatally damages an oiler. Later in the morning, a 93-plane strike from &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; sinks &quot;Shōhō&quot; – the first Japanese carrier ever sunk – prompting an American dive bomber pilot to send one of World War II″s most famous radio messages, &quot;SCRATCH ONE FLATTOP.&quot; In the evening, confused Japanese carrier pilots mistake &quot;Yorktown&quot; for their own carrier and begin to fly a landing pattern before realizing their mistake.
**On Madagascar, Diego Suarez falls to invading British forces. Since the invasion began on May 5, aircraft from the British aircraft carriers HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot; and have suppressed Vichy French aircraft, supported British ground forces ashore, attacked coastal artillery, a wrecked a French sloop, and sunk a French armed merchant cruiser and two French submarines.

Forty-one bombers are lost. Fifty-seven more British aircraft operate as night intruders in support of the attack. The Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, retired by Bomber Command a month earlier, participates in a bombing raid for the last time, as Whitleys borrowed from Operational Training Units flesh out the Bomber Command force for the raid.
* May 31
**Since May 1, the Germans and Italians have lost 40 aircraft over Malta in exchange for 25 British planes lost in combat. The British have lost only six aircraft on the ground, 24 fewer than the previous month.

===June===
* Royal Air Force Bomber Command mounts 20 major raids against Germany in June and July, losing 307 bombers (4.9 percent of the attacking force), as well as an additional 63 bombers lost on lesser raids. Beginning in June, Bomber Command monthly loss rates begin to hover consistently around 5 percent, which the British believe is the maximum sustainable loss rate.
* June 1 – Because of the similarity of the red disc in the center of the national insignia for U.S. military aircraft to Japanese markings, the United States adopts a new national insignia without the red disc, consisting simply of a white star centered in a blue circle . The new marking will remain in use until July 1943.
* June 1–2 (overnight) – Royal Air Force Bomber Command mounts what is nominally its second &quot;thousand-bomber raid&quot; – 956 bombers actually participate – targeting Essen, Germany. Industrial haze spoils the attack; the British bombers kill only 15 people in Essen and destroy only 11 homes there, while widely scattered bombs strike Oberhausen, Duisburg, and at least eleven other cities and towns, which suffer more damage than Essen itself.
* June 3 – In an effort to decoy U.S. forces away from planned Japanese landings on Midway Atoll and to cover planned Japanese landings on Attu and Kiska, aircraft from the carriers &quot;Junyo&quot; and &quot;Ryūjō&quot; strike Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. Although only 12 planes, all from &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, manage to reach Dutch Harbor, they inflict considerable damage.
* June 4
**32 aircraft from &quot;Junyo&quot; and &quot;Ryūjō&quot; conduct another damaging strike against Dutch Harbor. Small strikes by U.S. Navy Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats and U.S. Army Air Forces bombers against the two Japanese aircraft carriers are ineffective.
**The Battle of Midway begins with a predawn torpedo strike by U.S. Navy Consolidated PBY Catalinas against Japanese ships, which damages an oiler. After sunrise, 108 aircraft from all four Japanese aircraft carriers – , , , and – carry out a destructive strike on Midway Atoll, shooting down 17 and severely damaging seven of the atoll″s 26 fighters. A series of Midway-based strikes by various types of aircraft against the Japanese carriers sees the combat debut of the Grumman TBF Avenger, but achieve no hits and suffer heavy losses. All three U.S. aircraft carriers – , , and – launch strikes against the Japanese carriers; their 41 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers arrive first and achieve no hits, losing all but four of their number, but &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s and &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers arrive and inflict lethal damage on &quot;Akagi&quot; (which sinks on June 5) and &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Soryu&quot; (which both sink later on June 4). A retaliatory strike by &quot;Hiryu&quot; fatally damages &quot;Yorktown&quot; (which sinks on June 7), but &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; dive bombers then fatally damage &quot;Hiryu&quot; (which sinks on June 5). The loss of all four of their carriers cause the Japanese to cancel the Midway operation and withdraw. It is widely considered to be the turning point of World War II in the Pacific.
* June 6
**Flying 112 sorties, carrier aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; sink the Japanese heavy cruiser &quot;Mikuma&quot; as she withdraws from the Midway area, bringing the Battle of Midway to an end. Three Douglas TBD Devastators participate; it is the last combat mission for the Devastator.

* June 11 – In response to orders from Admiral Chester W. Nimitz to &quot;bomb the enemy out of Kiska,&quot; U.S. Army Air Forces Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers and U.S. Navy Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats begin a bombing campaign against Japanese forces at Kiska in the &quot;Kiska Blitz.&quot; The PBYs bomb almost hourly for 72 hours before withdrawing on July 13, while Army Air Forces continue with twice-daily raids until late June. Flying a round trip, the Army bombers will continue to raid Kiska from a base on Umnak until September.
* June 14–16 – German and Italian aircraft join Italian surface warships and submarines in opposing Operation Harpoon, an Allied Malta resupply convoy from Gibraltar escorted by the British aircraft carriers and , and Operation Vigorous, a simultaneous resupply convoy from Alexandria, Egypt; Royal Air Force and U.S. Army Air Forces aircraft from Malta and North Africa provide support to the convoys. Before the remnants of the Harpoon convoy arrive at Malta and the Vigorous convoy turns back to Alexandria, Axis aircraft sink three merchant cargo ships, fatally damage three destroyers, a cargo ship, and a tanker, and damage the British light cruisers and . Royal Air Force Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers knock the Italian battleship &quot;Littorio&quot; out of action for two months, and disable the Italian heavy cruiser &quot;Trento&quot;, allowing a British submarine to sink her.
* June 20 – In North Africa, Axis forces begin the final phase of the Battle of Gazala with a massive aerial bombardment of Tobruk by between 296 and 306 aircraft. Tobruk surrenders the next day.

* July 15 – The Republic of China Air Force″s American Volunteer Group – the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; – is transferred to the United States Army Air Forces, in which it becomes the 23rd Fighter Group. In its six months of Chinese service, the unit has claimed 286 Japanese aircraft in exchange for 12 of its own lost in air-to-air combat.
* July 18 – The Me 262 third prototype makes its first flight under jet power, test-piloted by Fritz Wendel. Previous flight attempts starting in April 1941 by the first prototype airframe had been driven by a Junkers Jumo 210 piston engine, spinning a propeller in the fuselage&#x27;s nose before any of its intended jet engines were flight-ready.
* July 22 – The first Lockheed P-38F Lightning fighters of the U.S. Army Air Forces″ 14th Fighter Group depart Presque Isle, Maine, for the United Kingdom via Iceland. They become the first fighters to fly across the Atlantic Ocean.

* August 4 – The Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter scores its first aerial victories, when two P-38s of the 343rd Fighter Group flown by U.S. Army Air Forces Lieutenants K. Ambrose and S. A. Long shoot down two Japanese Kawanishi H6K4 flying boats near the Aleutian Islands.
* August 7 – Operation Watchtower, the U.S. invasion of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo, begins. The aircraft carriers and cover the landings with airstrikes, and U.S. Army Air Forces Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses bomb Japanese airfields at Rabaul. Rabaul-based Japanese aircraft attack U.S. transports and their escorts off Guadalcanal, and dogfights with aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; ensue.
* August 8 – U.S. Marines capture the partially completed Japanese airstrip on Guadalcanal. They will rename it Henderson Field, and it will be the focal point of the six-month Guadalcanal campaign. Offshore, Rabaul-based Japanese aircraft damage a U.S. transport, which becomes a total loss.
* August 11 – Axis opposition to Operation Pedestal – an Allied resupply convoy to Malta escorted by the British aircraft carriers , , and , against which 1,000 Axis aircraft have gathered in Sicily and Sardinia – begins when the German submarine &quot;U-73&quot; hits &quot;Eagle&quot; with four torpedoes in the Mediterranean Sea about north of Algiers. &quot;Eagle&quot; sinks in eight minutes, with the loss of 131 of her crew and 16 Sea Hurricane fighters. German torpedo planes launch ineffective attacks on the convoys, and a strike by Royal Air Force Bristol Beaufighter destroys five and damages 14 of the German aircraft on the ground after they return to base.
* August 12
**The first American aircraft – a U.S. Navy PBY-5A Catalina amphibian – lands on Guadalcanal″s Henderson Field. Aircraft based there will become known as the &quot;Cactus Air Force.&quot;
**German and Italian aircraft attack the Pedestal convoy in the Mediterranean, damaging HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot;, sinking a destroyer and a merchant cargo ship, and possibly inflicting fatal damage on two other cargo ships. Italian aircraft employ three new weapons for the first time: the &quot;motobomba&quot; torpedo, a new bomb dropped by Re.2001 fighters designed to cause maximum damage on aircraft carrier flight decks, and an explosive-laden unmanned Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bomber controlled as a guided missile by a CANT floatplane. The &quot;motobomba&quot;s strike no targets, one of the flight-deck bombs is dropped onto the deck of HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; but breaks up and fails to explode, and the SM.79 drone goes out of control and flies inland to crash in Algeria.

* August 16 – During a routine antisubmarine warfare patrol over the Pacific Ocean off California, the two-man crew of the U.S. Navy blimp &quot;L-8&quot; disappears. The unmanned blimp then drifts over California and eventually crashes on a street in Daly City, California. A U.S. Navy investigation concludes that the crew left the blimp voluntarily without their parachutes, but determines no reason for them to have done so. &quot;L-8&quot; is repaired and returns to service, but no trace of the two missing crewmen is ever found.
* August 17 – Heavy bombers of the United States Army Air Forces″ Eighth Air Force carry out their first raid, attacking a railroad marshalling yard at Rouen, France.
* August 18–19 (overnight) – Royal Air Force Bomber Command″s Pathfinder Force flies its first mission, with 31 Pathfinder aircraft attempting to mark the target – the German submarine base at Flensburg – for a main force of 87 bombers.

Based on Crete and beginning reconnaissance operations over Egypt in May, Ju 86Ps of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;′s Long-Range Reconnaissance Group 123 previously had flown with impunity because Allied fighters could not reach their operating altitude. Although the Ju 86P climbs to , Reynolds manages to fire at it before it escapes. The RAF concludes that it must further lighten a Spitfire so that it can intercept the Ju 86Ps.
** The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; begins high-altitude nuisance raids against England by Junkers Ju 86R bombers carrying one bomb each and capable of flying as high as . On the first day, two Ju 86R-2s drop one bomb each on Camberley and Southampton, doing little damage, and a Polish Royal Air Force Spitfire squadron that attempts to intercept the Ju 86Rs fail to reach the altitude of the bombers.

<text>The Swan River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately 60 mi (97 km) long, in northeastern Minnesota in the United States.

It rises in Swan Lake, in southeast Itasca County, near Pengilly, approximately 13 mi (21 km) southwest of Hibbing. It flows southwest, east of Trout Lake, then SSE past Warba. It joins the Mississippi in northern Aitkin County at Jacobson, approximately 20 mi (32 km) southeast of Grand Rapids. 
At Warba, the river measures approximately 130 cubic feet per second.

Swan River is an English translation of the native Ojibwe-language name.

<text>Henry Cogswell College is a former private institution of higher learning that was based in Washington state from 1979 to 2006. The college offered bachelor&#x27;s degrees in business administration, computer science, digital arts, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, mechanical engineering technology, and professional management. It was named after temperance movement crusader Henry D. Cogswell. Historically, the college had an enrollment of 300 students that relied mainly on Boeing-related tuition.

==History==

Henry Cogswell College was founded in 1979 in Kirkland, Washington as Cogswell College North (at the time, an affiliate of Cogswell College in Sunnyvale, California), largely to provide engineering education to local Boeing employees. The college also operated night and summer classes at Shoreline Community College before permanently moving to south Kirkland.

The college moved to Everett, located near Boeing&#x27;s largest assembly plant, in 1996, leasing space in a former Bon Marché department store. In 2000, the college moved into the historic Federal Building in downtown Everett, spending $2 million to renovate the 1917-built office building. Off-campus classes were also held at a Boeing facility in the south Puget Sound (about 30 miles from Everett) to accommodate students living in that area. Limited classes continued to be offered at the Boeing facility even after the main campus moved to Everett. The institution closed on September 1, 2006, due to a decline in enrollment and substantial deficit.

<text>Gary Douglas Hardgrave (born 5 January 1960) is an Australian former politician who served in the House of Representatives from 1996 to 2007, representing the Liberal Party. He was a minister in the Howard government from 2001 to 2007, and later served as Administrator of Norfolk Island from 2014 to 2017.

==Early life==
Hardgrave was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and was educated at Griffith University, Queensland. In the 1970s he began his career as a radio broadcaster, and a TV reporter firstly with the Australian children&#x27;s television show &quot;Wombat&quot; between 1979 and 1982. Between 1982 and 1986, he reported for award-winning Queensland TV programme &quot;State Affair&quot;, in 1987 for ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot; before returning to BTQ 7 in 1988 as a senior reporter for &quot;Carroll at Seven&quot;. In 1989, he was the founding news director for SEA-FM Gold Coast and later worked as a media adviser to Liberal politicians, before entering politics.

==Politics==
Hardgrave initially ran for election to the Queensland state seat of Sunnybank in the 1992 election, but lost. He contested the Division of Moreton successfully at the 1996 federal election against Labor incumbent Garrie Gibson, going on to retain the seat in 1998, 2001 and 2004.

Hardgrave served as Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs from 2001 to 2004, Minister for Vocational and Technical Education between October 2004 to early 2007 and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister from 7 October 2003 to 30 January 2007. On 23 January 2007, Hardgrave was axed from the ministry and returned to the backbench. He lost his seat to Graham Perrett in the 2007 election.

==Career after politics==
In March 2008, Hardgrave returned to media and corporate activities. From January 2011, he hosted talk-back in Brisbane.

Since leaving Parliament, Hardgrave graduated from the Australian Institute of Company Directors&#x27; course and served on a variety of company and community boards including Brisbane Airport Corporation and TAFE Queensland. In January 2014, he left full-time radio but commenced a weekly column in the Queensland &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; newspaper before resigning media and corporate activities in June 2014.

On the advice of the Abbott government, Australian Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove appointed Hardgrave as the 37th Administrator of the Australian External Territory of Norfolk Island. His term commenced on 1 July 2014, and he was Administrator when Norfolk Island lost its self-governing status.

He later went on to host a ‘Sky After Dark’ political opinion show on conservative television station Sky News Australia, where he is a regular critic of among other things, Labor Party MPs and action on climate change.

<doc id="566143" wikidata="Q746422" url="?curid=566143" title="White-throated bee-eater">
<text>The white-throated bee-eater (Merops albicollis) is a near passerine bird in the bee-eater family, Meropidae. It breeds in semi-desert along the southern edge of the Sahara, Africa. The white-throated bee-eater is migratory, wintering in a completely different habitat in the equatorial rain forests of Africa from southern Senegal to Uganda.

==Description==

This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is predominantly green, but its face and throat are white with a black crown, eye stripe, and neckband. The underparts are pale green shading to blue on the breast. The eye is red and the beak is black.

The white-throated bee-eater can reach a length of 19–21 cm, excluding the two very elongated central tail feathers, which can exceed an additional length of 12 cm. They weigh between 20 and 28 grams. Sexes are alike, except that the male has longer tail feathers. The call is similar to European bee-eater.

==Habits==
White-throated bee-eaters also feed and roost communally. As the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. However, this species probably takes mainly flying ants and beetles.

==Nesting==
The white-throated bee-eater is a bird which breeds in dry sandy open country, such thorn scrub and near-desert. These abundant bee-eaters are gregarious, nesting colonially in sandy banks or open flat areas. They make a relatively long 1–2 m tunnel in which the 6 to 7 spherical white eggs are laid. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs, but up to five helpers also assist with caring for the young.

==Status==
Widespread and common throughout its large range, the white-throated bee-eater is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

<text>Luke Hartsuyker ( ; born 28 April 1959) is a former Australian politician who was a member of the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2019, representing the Division of Cowper in New South Wales for the National Party. He served as a government minister in the Turnbull government and an assistant minister in the Abbott government. In August 2018, he announced he would retire from parliament at the 2019 federal election.

==Background and career==
Hartsuyker was born in Muswellbrook, New South Wales, where he attended a state primary school and state high school. His father, Tom Hartsuyker, immigrated from the Netherlands in 1951 and subsequently established a Dutch-themed tourist park in Coffs Harbour called The Clog Barn. Hartsuyker was born a Dutch citizen by descent, but automatically lost his citizenship in 1995 by failing to meet a provision requiring foreign-born citizens to return to the Netherlands every ten years.

Hartsuyker holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Newcastle University, and an Associate Diploma in valuation. He is a Fellow of the Chartered Practising Accountants Australia. He managed his father&#x27;s business before entering politics. He and his wife, Irene, have two sons.

== Politics ==
In the 2001 federal election Hartsuyker was elected to the Division of Cowper after longstanding Nationals MP Garry Nehl retired from the seat. Hartsuyker retained the seat in subsequent elections: 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016.

In 2008, Hartsyuker was named after refusing to leave the Chamber for holding a life-sized cardboard cutout of then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, which he passed on to other members of the Opposition frontbench. He was aided by Liberal MP Don Randall, who brought the cutout into the chamber.

An electoral redistribution changed Cowper&#x27;s boundaries prior to the 2016 election: Port Macquarie was included in Cowper for the first time, while the region north of Coffs Harbour was transferred out of Cowper to the Division of Page.

Former Independent MP Rob Oakeshott, who lives in Port Macquarie (which had been within the Division of Lyne prior to the redistribution), contested the Division of Cowper at the 2016 election. A number of seat-level opinion polls in Cowper found the incumbent Hartsuyker and independent Oakeshott neck-and-neck on the two-party-preferred vote. Hartsuyker won re-election, but suffered a swing of 13 percent – the closest that the Nationals had come to losing Cowper in over half a century. The Nationals have held it for all but one term since 1919. While Oakeshott slashed Hartsuyker&#x27;s two-party margin to 4.5%, Cowper is still a safe National seat in a &quot;traditional&quot; two-party matchup with Labor.

On 8 August 2018, Hartsuyker announced he would retire from federal politics at the 2019 federal election.

===Ministerial career===
Hartsuyker served as the Assistant Minister for Employment and as the Deputy Leader of the House in the Abbott Ministry, between 18 September 2013 and September 2015. He was the Minister for Vocational Education and Skills in the First Turnbull Ministry between September 2015 and February 2016; the Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister between July 2016 and December 2017; and the Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment in the Second Turnbull Ministry between December 2017 and March 2018.

===Positions===
Hartsuyker opposes same-sex marriage and stated he would not vote for it. A 2011 poll in the Coffs Harbour Advocate, representing those within his electorate, resulted in 78% of respondents in favour of same-sex marriage. After his electorate voted in favour of same-sex marriage in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, Hartsuyker did vote in favour of the &quot;Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017&quot;.

<text>The brown anole (Anolis sagrei), also known commonly as the Cuban brown anole, Bahaman anole, or De la Sagra&#x27;s anole, is a species of lizard in the family Dactyloidae. The species is native to Cuba and the Bahamas. It has been widely introduced elsewhere, via the importation and exportation of plants where the anole would lay eggs in the soil of the pots, and is now found in Florida and other regions of the United States including southern Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Hawaii, North Carolina, and Southern California. It has also been introduced to other Caribbean islands, Mexico, and Taiwan.

This species is highly invasive. They are also much more wary of humans than most other Anole species. 
In its introduced range, it reaches exceptionally high population densities, is capable of expanding its range very quickly, and both outcompetes and consumes many species of native lizards, like the green anole. The brown anole&#x27;s introduction into the United States in the early 1970s has altered the behavior and negatively affected populations of the native Carolina anole (&quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot;, also known as the green anole), which have since generally been relegated to the treetops.

== Etymology ==
The specific name, &quot;sagrei&quot;, is in honor of Spanish botanist Ramón de la Sagra.

== Description ==
The brown anole is normally a light brown color with darker brown to black markings on its back, and several tan to light color lines on its sides. Like other anoles, it can change color, in this case a darker brown to black. Its dewlap ranges from yellow to orange-red.

Brown anoles are typically 5.0 to 8.5 inches long. 
The males can grow as large as their male Carolina anole counterparts, around long, with some individuals topping . The females are also around the size of female Carolina anoles, which ranges from . The male brown anole&#x27;s head is smaller than that of the male Carolina anole.

The brown anole&#x27;s tail has a ridge that travels all the way up to behind the head, a feature that the Carolina anole lacks.
Female anolis lizards exhibit heritable polymorphism in their dorsal patterning. A study in Gainesville, Florida reported that one-third of &quot;A. sagrei&quot; females displayed a male-like chevron dorsal pattern, while other females had a striped dorsal pattern with continuous variation.

== Removal ==
In Taiwan, the investigation had discovered that distribution of this foreign species was increasing, posing potential competitive crowding out effect towards the native species such as the Diploderma swinhonis and the Takydromus formosanus in Taiwan. Therefore, the monitoring removal plan was being carried out in 2009. The current removal methods include manual removal, improving the habitat, capturing with traps, biological control, and drug control. The most effective way of capturing the Anolis sagrei is to capture with bare hands at night.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The native range of the brown anole extends over much of the Caribbean, including Jamaica, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and other countries. Currently, they are considered an invasive species in parts of Florida in the United States, including the Florida Keys, Dade County, Broward County, and Palm Beach County as of 1985. Today, their range has extended as far as Georgia and to parts of Mexico. It is believed that these lizards were unintentionally brought to the area in cargo shipments for the Caribbean, as well as an intentional release of approximately 100 individuals in 1941. The species is also established in parts of Honduras.

The brown anole tends to live on the ground, avoiding trees and preferring to live in smaller plants and shrubs and is found in both urban and suburban areas. When the weather is warm, the brown anole can be found basking. When it is cold, they prefer sheltered areas. Brown anoles are less arboreal than the green anoles which are frequently found living in trees, on the ground, or in low vegetation. 

Although the brown anole was initially found in the Caribbean and then introduced to southern Florida, the species is now moving north. Specifically, the species has been found in southern Georgia as well as coastal Georgia. Researchers expect that this trend will continue in the coming years and that the brown anole will continue to migrate to other locations in the north. Due to their invasiveness, they are often the dominant reptile species in a given environment.

== Conservation ==
While the brown anole is an invasive species in the United States, they likely do provide some benefits to their ecosystems. Because they eat predominantly arthropods, they may keep populations of spiders at appropriate levels. Some research suggests that local spider populations depend directly on the population of the brown anole.

In habitats they share with the green anole, the brown anole dominates and shrinks the population of the green anole. They also occasionally eat hatchlings of the green anole, further putting pressure on their populations. No concentrated efforts have been made to mitigate the spread of the brown anole populations in the United States.

Additionally, the brown anole has been shown to be responsible for the transmission of parasites among lizard populations in Hawai&#x27;i, which are often deadly for these local populations.

== Phylogeny ==
The brown anole belongs to the family and genus, Datyloidae and &quot;Anolis&quot;, respectively. 

The most closely related species to &quot;Anolis sagrei&quot; is &quot;Anolis nelsoni&quot;, also called Nelson&#x27;s anole. 

The brown anole has a shorter snout length than the green anole. The green anole, or &quot;Anolis carolinensis&quot;, is green or light brown patterned.

== Territoriality ==

=== Male-male competition ===
Studies suggest that male brown anoles exhibit territoriality over ground below perches on which they rest. When the male anole spots other males in his ground territory, he is very likely to put on displays to attempt to intimidate the competitor. If, however, the competitor presents himself on the same perch as the male or at roughly the same height, the male is much more likely to attack the competitor. So, the male brown anole is thought to use his perch to survey his territory, but is not likely to leave the perch to fight off competitors, as doing so would be costly. Additionally, research shows that the success of an individual male anole in competition with another is dependent on his size relative to his competitor. The size of a male also correlates with the height of his perch; that is, larger males are more often found on higher perches and smaller males on lower ones. Different specific confrontational behaviors are also exhibited by differently sized males; larger ones more often initiate conflict and smaller ones more often nod their heads towards larger anoles. The loss of a male brown anole&#x27;s tail has been shown to have little to no effect on the size of the territory he protects or dominance patterns between male brown anoles.

=== Habitat migration ===
Under certain circumstances, brown anoles leave their current territory and migrate to a new one. Males migrate to new territories in response to male-male competition, with smaller males being more likely to migrate. The distance that a male migrates is negatively correlated with his size relative to other males; large males travel shorter distances to new territories and small males travel longer distances to new territories. Female brown anoles do not show an association between size and probability of migration or migration distance. Instead, females in territories with a high density of other females are more likely to move to territories with lower densities of other females. Generally, individuals, regardless of sex, prefer to remain in their original territory as migrating poses predation risks and energetic costs.

== Diet ==

Brown anoles feed on small arthropods such as crickets, moths, ants, grasshoppers, cockroaches, mealworms, beetles, flies, earwigs, butterflies, spiders, waxworms, amphipods, and isopods. Brown anoles also feed on other types of invertebrates such as earthworms and snails. They may also eat other lizards, such as skinks, geckos, curly-tailed lizards, the Carolina anole, lizard eggs and hatchlings (including members of their species), and their own molted skin and detached tails. If near water, they eat aquatic arthropods or small fish – nearly any prey that will fit in their mouths. Occasionally, individuals will also consume figs and plant material; it might be interpreted as a hydration mechanism or accidental ingestion.

== Reproduction ==
In a given habitat, female brown anoles reproduce in the warmer parts of the year. The brood size of a single female brown anole is one egg, which it lays in damp environments. The female lays its eggs roughly 2 weeks apart from each other, resulting in a total of 15 to 18 eggs in a single breeding season. The breeding season of a female extends slightly longer than that of a male, as the female is capable of storing sperm for a short time. When a juvenile anole is born, usually in June, it is completely independent from its parents. Sexual maturation of both males and females occurs within a year of hatching, so an individual can participate in the mating season following its birth.

When a female anole is prepared for mating, it begins by making itself visible to the male whose territory it is in. When mating occurs, the male grabs on to the back on the females neck with its mouth, so prior to mating, a female will bend its neck such that it is more visible and accessible by the male, indicating that it is ready for procreation. If the male decides to reproduce, it will begin mating with the female, which usually lasts from 30 to 60 minutes. Males indicate that they are available for mating by extending their dewlap and bobbing their head.

== Mating ==
Male anoles have a flap that extends below their neck called a &quot;dewlap&quot;. Dewlap extension occurs alongside a number of behaviors exhibited by the brown anole, namely during courtship. In an experiment by Richard Tokarz, an experimental group of male brown anoles underwent a surgery that rendered them unable to extend their dewlaps; a control group of male anoles were subject to the same surgery, but without the final step, so they retained the ability to extend their dewlap. Males and females were then put together in an enclosure; the experimental males took more time to begin mating when in the presence of females and mating took longer. Control males were more quick to begin mating and finished mating more quickly.

A separate study suggests that the dominant male in a territory is more influential over the mating partners of a female than female mate choice. During observation, females that mated with multiple males did so because dominance over a territory transferred between males, while the female remained in the same territory. There were no observations of female brown anoles seeking out different males or entering a new territory.

Additionally, female brown anoles are more likely to participate in mating behaviors in the presence of precipitation.

== Parental care ==
An individual egg will hatch four weeks after it was laid. From the moment they are born, the anole is completely independent from its parents. As such, the brown anole displays no reproductive division of labor past the mating event and displays no cooperative brood care. However, female brown anoles have been observed digging holes and positioning eggs within these holes after oviposition. This is thought to allow for additional parental influence on phenotype and offspring survival. The selection of a site to nest by a female and how she lays her eggs within this site is performed in an effort to maximize survival of her offspring. A female will lay one egg at a time and can lay a new egg each week of the reproductive season.

== Enemies ==
Known predators of the brown anole include broad-headed skinks, snakes, birds, and occasionally other species of anoles. More often than not, brown anoles eaten by other anoles are juvenile. Predation by many vertebrates has been observed. Spiders can prey upon young anoles and are one of the few exceptions to this observation.

== Antipredator behavior ==

The coloration of the brown anole allows it to easily blend in with its surroundings, making it difficult for predators to spot. The brown anole has a detachable tail that can be detached if the anole is grabbed by the tail by a predator or used as a distraction, as it twitches after detaching. The tail grows back afterwards, albeit smaller and a duller color. Despite the extensive list of predators, the lizard&#x27;s alertness and sprint speed make it very difficult for predators to track and capture.

== Physiology ==

=== Hindlimb length ===
When raised in terraria with surfaces differing in width (wide or narrow), brown anoles wide-surface terraria grew longer hindlimb than their narrow-surface terraria counterparts. Brown anoles demonstrate phenotypic plasticity in this trait, akin to very rapid evolution.

===Toepads ===
Extreme climate events such as hurricanes can provoke species changes through natural selection. In areas recently affected by hurricanes, anoles with large, strong-gripping toepads were more successful in surviving. In 12 insular populations of &quot;Anolis sagrei&quot;, and 188 species from across the Neotropics over the past 70 years, the populations that were more frequently affected by hurricanes had proportionately larger toepads.

=== Dewlap ===
Nearly all species of anole, including the &quot;Anolis sagrei&quot;, have a dewlap on their throat. The dewlap can be used as a means of identifying specific species within the Dactyloidae family. This is useful for not only mate selection between male anoles, but also to ensure the female is indeed mating with an individual within their own species. The dewlap of the &quot;Anolis sagrei&quot; is typically a shade of red or yellow, while the rest of an individual is brown. The extension of the dewlap is controlled by the ceratobranchials II, a bone below the throat. The size and color of a species&#x27; dewlap has been shown to vary with the light of their environments and color of their body, respectively; specifically, dimmer environments elicit larger dewlaps and duller body colors elicit brighter dewlap colors. In the brown anole, dewlap color is not dependent on an individual&#x27;s consumption of lutein and zeaxanthin, pigments typically used as colorants in species that display color on their body. Dewlaps are believed to be involved in mate selection, as well as communication between individual brown anoles.

== Shedding ==
Brown anoles molt in small pieces, unlike some other reptiles, which molt in one large piece. Anoles may consume the molted skin to replenish supplies of calcium. In captivity, the molted skin may stick to the anole if humidity is too low. The unshed layer of skin can build up around the eyes, preventing the lizard from feeding and may lead to starvation. This can be prevented by maintaining high humidity.

== Communication ==
Anoles use visual cues as their primary signaling mode.

<text>A newspaper stamp is a special type of postage stamp used to pay the cost of mailing newspapers and other periodicals. Although many types were issued in the 19th century, typically representing rates reduced from regular mail, they generally fell out of use in the mid-20th century, as mail services began to arrange bulk handling directly with publishers.

The exact use of newspaper stamps varied; small-value stamps were generally intended to be affixed to newspaper wrappers, in much the fashion of regular mail, but with values usually less than regular stamps. Higher values were used on bundles of newspapers, and later on receipts.

The first newspaper stamp was issued by Austria in 1851, and a number of nations soon followed suit. The newspaper stamps of the United States, in use from 1865 to 1898, were always intended for bulk shipments, and with face values ranging up to US$100, are the highest-value newspaper stamps.

Newspaper stamps seem to have been printed in great quantities, and almost all types are today inexpensive and easily acquired.

<doc id="566166" wikidata="Q2646347" url="?curid=566166" title="David Hawker">
<text>David Peter Maxwell Hawker (born 1 May 1949) is a former Australian politician who served as a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from May 1983 to July 2010, representing the Division of Wannon, Victoria, previously represented by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser.

Hawker served as the 25th Speaker of the House of Representatives from 2004 to 2007.

==Early life==
Hawker was born in Adelaide on 1 May 1949, the son of Pamela Gavin and David Hawker. His father, a grazier, was a grandson of colonial MP George Charles Hawker and cousin of federal MP Charles Hawker.

Hawker&#x27;s family moved to Apsley, Victoria, when he was four years old, where they ran a sheep station. He attended Geelong Grammar School and went on to study mechanical engineering at the University of Melbourne. He entered residence at Trinity College in 1968, graduating Bachelor of Engineering in 1972. He subsequently worked as a graduate engineer at the Altona Refinery and also as a jackaroo outside of Port Augusta, South Australia, before returning to manage the family property at Apsley.

==Career==
After Fraser announced his retirement from politics amid the Coalition&#x27;s heavy defeat in the 1983 federal election, Hawker won the seat in a May 1983 by-election. Hawker was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1990–93, a Deputy Opposition Whip 1989–90 and 1994, and Chief Opposition Whip 1994–96.

On 15 November 2004 Hawker was chosen by the Parliamentary Liberal Party as its candidate for the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives. He was formally elected to the position on 16 November without opposition. After the 2007 federal election, Labor member Harry Jenkins succeeded Hawker as Speaker of the House, and took office on 12 February 2008.

Hawker announced in June 2009 that he would retire from parliament at the 2010 federal election.

==Speaker==

As speaker from 2004 to 2007, Hawker was the subject of some controversy.

===Early dissent===

Some of Hawker&#x27;s rulings, from motions put by the Australian Labor Party Opposition, were somewhat controversial early in his term, with one session of Question Time on 1 December 2004 resulting in twelve points of order, some continuously raised, to Brendan Nelson&#x27;s response to a question on school funding raised by Sophie Mirabella, in that it was seen by the Opposition to anticipate debate. This session resulted in a dissent motion regarding the permission of ministers tabling documents at the end of answers, which was negatived. A further dissent motion was raised on 7 December 2004, regarding questions asked relating to public affairs but not directly regarding the subject&#x27;s portfolio, specifically, the desire of the Opposition to question De-Anne Kelly to her supposed approval of funding of a project not relating to her portfolio of Veterans&#x27; Affairs. This dissent motion was also voted down. Likewise, a motion of dissent on 28 November 2005 to a ruling that the Member for Perth resume his seat, having twice ignored an instruction to desist in argument across the chamber, was voted down. (Immediately thereafter, the motion to &quot;place further motions on notice&quot; was passed without a vote, and the Speaker responded to the Leader of the Opposition&#x27;s subsequent Point of Order by stating that the motion was a &quot;request&quot;.)

===Questions over impartiality===
A 2006 ruling made by Hawker after an incident during a heated exchange in the House brought further motions of dissent from the Opposition, and drew criticism of the Speaker&#x27;s impartiality from the media.

After a motion regarding share trading was moved by Kelvin Thomson, the Member for Wills, on 25 May 2006, Leader of the House Tony Abbott referred to Thomson indirectly using unparliamentary language by moving the motion &quot;that that snivelling grub be no longer heard&quot;. The Deputy Chair at the time, Peter Lindsay, did not make comment against to the withdrawal Abbott made using the words &quot;if I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally&quot;. Later, the Speaker assumed the Chair, but it was only after the Opposition attempted to move a dissent motion that Abbott withdrew &quot;unconditionally any imputation or offensive words against the member for Wills&quot;.

The following week, on 31 May, Manager of Opposition Business Julia Gillard attempted to mimic exactly the exchange of 25 May by moving the motion &quot;that that snivelling grub over there be not further heard&quot; against Abbott on a health legislation amendment, and then stating that &quot;If I have offended grubs, I withdraw unconditionally&quot;, the Speaker asked Gillard to withdraw &quot;without reservation&quot;. Gillard responded that &quot;in accordance with your ruling yesterday, I have withdrawn effectively&quot;, but the Speaker then said that &quot;I have no option...but to name the member&quot;, and subsequently by motion from Abbott, Gillard was removed from the House for 24 hours.

The Opposition had earlier asked questions to the Speaker about the apparent impartiality of the latter ruling, but criticism of the decision reached the media, with the Speaker defending the decision made referring to Abbott&#x27;s later unconditional withdrawal. Under standing order 94A, the Speaker can throw members out of the parliament without a verbal warning for one hour. This rule has frequently been used to expel disruptive opposition members from the parliament. During the Question Time debate over the government&#x27;s controversial Industrial Relations reforms some eleven Labor members were thrown out in one day.

==Honours==
On 11 June 2012, he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia for &quot;distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, to public administration and monetary policy reform, and to the community through local government, health and sporting organisations.&quot;

<doc id="566168" wikidata="Q2907941" url="?curid=566168" title="Bobby Caldwell">
<text>Robert Hunter Caldwell (August 15, 1951 – March 14, 2023) was an American singer and songwriter. He released several albums spanning R&amp;B, soul, jazz, and adult contemporary. He is known for his soulful and versatile vocals. Caldwell released the hit single and his signature song &quot;What You Won&#x27;t Do for Love&quot; from his double platinum debut album &quot;Bobby Caldwell&quot; in 1978. After several R&amp;B and smooth jazz albums, Caldwell turned to singing standards from the Great American Songbook. He wrote many songs for other artists, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 single &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot; for Amy Grant and Peter Cetera. Caldwell&#x27;s musical catalog is perhaps best known today for its later sampling by several prolific hip hop and R&amp;B artists.

==Early life==
Bobby Caldwell was born in Manhattan, but grew up in Miami, Florida. His mother sold real estate and one of her clients was reggae singer Bob Marley; Caldwell and Marley became friends. Growing up in Miami exposed Caldwell to a variety of music such as Haitian, Latin, reggae, and R&amp;B. His parents hosted a local variety television show called &quot;Suppertime&quot;. He grew up listening to the music of Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. When he was 12, Caldwell started playing piano and guitar. He was drawn to rock and roll, jazz, and rhythm and blues.

==Career==
Caldwell was a member of a Miami band called Katmandu who wrote much of their material while also performing traditional standards. Caldwell played multiple instruments and sang. At 17, he worked with the band in Las Vegas, then moved to Los Angeles. 

Caldwell got his first career break as a rhythm guitarist for Little Richard in the early 1970s. Caldwell and his band eventually left Little Richard, and Caldwell went solo. By 1977, he had spent six years in Los Angeles playing in different bar bands and trying to get a record deal. Caldwell eventually signed with TK Records in Miami in 1978. After songs for his first album were recorded, executives told Caldwell they enjoyed the album, but thought it was lacking a hit. Caldwell returned to the studio for two days and wrote &quot;What You Won&#x27;t Do for Love&quot;. TK was mainly an R&amp;B label popular among African American listeners. Executives at the label wanted to conceal the fact that Caldwell was white, so they kept his face off the album cover. When he toured with Natalie Cole to support the album, most of the audience was black and many were surprised that Caldwell was white.

&quot;What You Won&#x27;t Do for Love&quot; on &quot;Bobby Caldwell &quot;reached the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Hot 100 (No. 9) R&amp;B (No. 6), and Adult Contemporary (No. 10) charts. The song has been covered, remade and sampled many times. Caldwell remade it in 1998. It was covered by Go West, Phyllis Hyman, Roy Ayers, Michael Bolton, Intro, Boyz II Men and Snoh Aalegra and was sampled by Tupac Shakur for his hit &quot;Do for Love&quot;. It was covered by Elliott Yamin during the fifth season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2006. Caldwell&#x27;s track &quot;My Flame&quot; is sampled for &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; by The Notorious B.I.G. featuring R&amp;B group 112.

Caldwell&#x27;s debut album was followed by &quot;Cat in the Hat&quot; (1980) and &quot;Carry On&quot; (1982). The track &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; from &quot;Cat in the Hat&quot; was sampled by J Dilla on Common&#x27;s &quot;The Light&quot; from his 2000 album &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;. &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; was also covered by artists John Legend and Dwele. For the album &quot;Carry On&quot;, Caldwell played all the instruments, was the producer and helped with arranging and mixing. In 2019, Lil Nas X was sued for $25 million for using the song &quot;Carry On&quot; (from the album of the same name) without permission in his own song of the same name from his 2018 mixtape &quot;Nasaratti&quot;, which at the time was available on YouTube, Spotify and SoundCloud. In 1983, Caldwell released &quot;August Moon&quot; only in Japan. It was released in the United States in the 1990s.

Singer Boz Scaggs advised Caldwell to write songs for other musicians after TK Records shut down. Caldwell wrote &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot;, which became a hit for Amy Grant and Peter Cetera, along with songs for Scaggs himself, Roy Ayers, Chicago, Natalie Cole, Neil Diamond, Roberta Flack, and Al Jarreau.

On &quot;Blue Condition&quot; (1996), Caldwell turned from R&amp;B to recording big band arrangements of songs from the Great American Songbook, particularly those sung by Frank Sinatra. He also portrayed Sinatra in tributes to the Rat Pack in Las Vegas. He continued to sing standards on &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; (1999), &quot;The Consummate Bobby Caldwell&quot; (2010) and &quot;After Dark&quot; (2014). In 2015, he collaborated with record producer Jack Splash on the album &quot;Cool Uncle&quot;.

==Death==
Caldwell died at his home in Great Meadows, Independence Township, New Jersey, on March 14, 2023, at the age of 71. His death was announced the following day by his wife, Mary Beth Caldwell. According to his wife, Caldwell&#x27;s health had declined after suffering severe side effects from fluoroquinolone in 2017.

==Film soundtracks==
Caldwell wrote and performed songs for the movies &quot;Back to School&quot; (&quot;Educated Girl&quot;), &quot;Mac and Me&quot; (&quot;Take Me, I&#x27;ll Follow You&quot;), &quot;Salsa&quot; (&quot;Puerto Rico&quot;) and its sequel (&quot;Every Teardrop&quot;). He also recorded a song for the 1984 film &quot;Night of the Comet&quot; (&quot;Never Give Up&quot;). Due to what he has cited in interviews as a lower cost of use than the original recordings, his versions of big band standards have appeared in several films. Examples include &quot;Simone&quot; (2001) and &quot;Lake Boat&quot; (2002).

Aside from a minor role in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Salsa&quot;, Caldwell portrayed Frank Sinatra from October 1999 to January 2000 in the Las Vegas musical &quot;The Rat Pack Is Back&quot;.

<doc id="566175" wikidata="Q16195116" url="?curid=566175" title="Kelly Hoare">
<text>Kelly Joy Hoare (; 1 July 1963 – 21 March 2024) was an Australian politician. She was a member of the House of Representatives from 1998 to 2007, representing the New South Wales seat of Charlton for the Australian Labor Party (ALP). She succeeded her father Bob Brown in federal parliament.

==Early life==
Hoare was born on 1 July 1963 in Deniliquin, New South Wales. She is one of two children born to Elizabeth Joy () and Robert James Brown. Her father, a school principal, was elected to state parliament in 1978 and to federal parliament in 1980, becoming a federal government minister. She is also a distant descendant of Henry Turner, one of the founders of the ALP.

Hoare completed a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Canberra. She was a public servant before entering politics, working as an auditor in the Department of Defence and later in the employment department where she was responsible for unemployed people with special needs. She then worked as an electorate officer for her father.

==Politics==
Hoare was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election, succeeding her father in the seat of Charlton. She was re-elected at the 2001 and 2004 elections. She is the first woman to follow her father into federal parliament.

In 2003, Hoare was described as the &quot;only Caucus member from New South Wales not factionally aligned&quot;, although she opposed Kim Beazley returning to the party&#x27;s leadership. She was a public opponent of the proposed Anvil Hill Coal Mine.

Prior to the 2007 federal election, Hoare was successfully challenged for ALP preselection by high-profile trade unionist Greg Combet. Her removal as the endorsed candidate was acrimonious. She publicly threatened to sue the ALP for unfair dismissal, and she stated that her removal would lead to her family losing its house as she was the sole breadwinner. After being replaced by Combet, allegations of sexual misconduct against Hoare were leaked to the Murdoch media. In her final speech to parliament in June 2007, she stated she was &quot;disgusted by the vile way in which I have been treated by people from whom I should have been able to expect greater decency, loyalty and support&quot; and that there was &quot;nothing voluntary about my departure from this parliament&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hoare and her husband had two children. In May 2007 she publicly stated she was undergoing counselling after she &quot;allegedly demanded sex from a government driver&quot;. She died on 21 March 2024.

<doc id="566185" wikidata="Q6210353" url="?curid=566185" title="Joe Hockey">
<text>Joseph Benedict Hockey (born 2 August 1965) is an Australian former politician and diplomat. He was the Member of Parliament for North Sydney from 1996 until 2015. He was the Treasurer of Australia in the Abbott government from 18 September 2013 until September 2015 when he resigned from Cabinet, having refused an alternative offer from the incoming prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. He previously served as the Minister for Human Services and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in the Howard government. He also served as Ambassador of Australia to the United States from January 2016 until January 2020.

Hockey&#x27;s parliamentary resignation triggered a 2015 North Sydney by-election where he was succeeded by Trent Zimmerman, who had previously worked for Hockey as a staffer. His appointment as Ambassador of Australia to the United States was announced on 8 December 2015 to replace Kim Beazley, whose term ended in early 2016, and he assumed that position on 29 January 2016. His term as ambassador ended on 30 January 2020, and he was succeeded by Arthur Sinodinos the week after.

==Early life and career==
Hockey was born the youngest of four siblings in North Sydney to Australian mother, Beverley, and Palestinian father, Richard Hokeidonian, who was born in Mandatory Palestine. His father&#x27;s surname was anglicised to &quot;Hockey&quot; in 1948 after his arrival in Australia. He was named after Joseph Benedict Chifley, the post-war prime minister whose immigration policies allowed for his father to enter Australia.

Hockey attended St Aloysius&#x27; College, Milsons Point and the University of Sydney, residing at St John&#x27;s College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws. While at university he was President of the University of Sydney Students&#x27; Representative Council, and assisted in inviting Pope John Paul II to visit the University of Sydney during the 1986 Australian papal visit. In 1987, Hockey protested at Bob Hawke&#x27;s introduction of university fees. Hockey&#x27;s term as SRC president, besides the protests, included the renovation of the club&#x27;s headquarters, a cutback on the expenses of &quot;Honi Soit&quot;, the closure of the SRC Women&#x27;s Room, but the opening of a free legal advice service. Towards the end of his term as SRC President, the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister Lionel Bowen phoned Hockey and invited him to join the ALP. Hockey researched the philosophies of John Stuart Mill and decided to join the Liberal Party. Upon graduating, Hockey worked as a banking and finance lawyer at Corrs Chambers Westgarth and subsequently as the Director of Policy to the Premier of New South Wales, before entering politics.

==Political career==

Hockey worked as a policy advisor to Premier John Fahey before the 1995 New South Wales state election. Hockey became the president of the NSW Young Liberals and had a position in Nick Greiner&#x27;s state government, reforming the financial and business structure of the state.

===Howard government===
Hockey was preselected as a Liberal Party of Australia candidate for the 1996 election in the Division of North Sydney when aged just 29. He faced little preselection competition, since the seat&#x27;s incumbent independent, Ted Mack, was thought to be unbeatable. However, Mack did not renominate; had his intentions been known earlier, it was widely believed at the time that Hockey would have faced a more rigorous preselection contest for what has traditionally been a &quot;blue ribbon&quot; Liberal seat. As it was, Hockey all but assured himself of becoming the seat&#x27;s next member with his preselection victory. &quot;Traditional&quot; two-party matchups during Mack&#x27;s tenure had shown North Sydney as a fairly safe Liberal seat, and it had been a foregone conclusion that the seat would revert to the Liberals once Mack retired. In 1993, for instance, the Liberals would have held the seat on a traditional two-party margin of 9.5 percent–just on the edge of being safe. As expected, Hockey regained the seat for the Liberals on 65.6 percent of the two-party preferred vote. He actually won 57.8 percent of the primary vote, more than enough to win the seat outright without the need for preferences.

When contesting the 1996 election, Hockey bought a bus which he painted in the colours of the North Sydney Bears, which had the effect of positioning Hockey as an Independent and showed Hockey&#x27;s local ties. Hockey would park the bus everywhere in his electorate to raise awareness. Robert Orrell, Hockey&#x27;s campaign manager in 1995, states that Hockey presented himself as a Liberal in &quot;John Howard&quot; areas like Lane Cove which had recently been redistributed from Howard&#x27;s seat of Bennelong. He branded himself as an independent in areas like North Sydney and McMahons Point. Hockey made use of his parents’ reputation within the local community and his business connections to successfully connect with supporters and volunteers - giving out umbrellas and other souvenirs. A key issue in the 1996 election was the issue of aircraft noise: Laurie Brereton, the ALP transport minister, had closed east–west runways and opened north–south runways at Sydney Airport, diverting aircraft noise from Labor seats to Liberal seats.

Soon after his election in 1996, He was appointed the chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum. During this time, Hockey formed a friendship with Anthony Albanese, and Albanese took Hockey to his electorate to see the inequalities of the airport routing. Following this, Hockey worked to address inconsistencies in the airport noise amelioration program. Hockey and fellow &quot;small-l liberals&quot; Chris Gallus and Susan Jeanes founded the short-lived John Stuart Mill Society to combat the conservative Lyons Forum. Hockey made his maiden speech in September 1996, highlighting modern liberalism, composed of recognition of the rights of the individual, parliamentary democracy, and committing to improve society through reform. Hockey highlighted his father&#x27;s heritage, and highlighted barriers against women achieving success. In the lead-up to the 1998 election, which Hockey characterised as &quot;the GST election&quot;, despite being the minister in charge of the GST, Hockey stopped campaigning shortly before the election because he felt that talking about the GST was losing him votes. He was awarded the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation portfolio from 1998 to 2001 and Minister for Small Business and Tourism (2001–04).

In January 2000, Hockey had done an interview with the John Laws program about the GST, confirming the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC)&#x27;s position of businesses being able to round up or down the price of goods and services when needed. This caused controversy, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; printed a story that declared that voters could be charged more than the 10% GST promised.

When HIH Insurance went bankrupt in March 2001, Joe Hockey was the minister responsible for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which oversaw HIH. Although Hockey&#x27;s office had sought written assurances from HIH that everything was fine, the public felt that Hockey was to blame. Upon learning that the estimated damages were between $4-$8 billion, Hockey took this to the Cabinet and sought a bail out. Peter Costello advised that APRA should sort out HIH. After the collapse of HIH Insurance, Hockey became concerned about the NRMA, and called Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC), the ACCC, APRA and the Australian Taxation Office and instructed them to investigate NRMA Insurance thoroughly.

As part of his work as Tourism Minister, Hockey produced a White Paper analysing the tourism industry.

With the return of the Howard government in 2004, he was appointed Minister for Human Services and was elevated to the Cabinet in January 2007, when appointed Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Although North Sydney has long been a blue-ribbon Liberal seat, Hockey was the first person in over 60 years to be promoted to cabinet while holding the seat.

In 2004 as Human Services Minister, Hockey proposed an &quot;Access Card&quot; and spent $3 million advertising the card before submitting the legislation to parliament.

Hockey regularly appeared on the Seven Network&#x27;s morning program &quot;Sunrise&quot; in the &quot;Big Guns of Politics&quot; section debating the Opposition Leader, Kevin Rudd, drawing 20,000–30,000 additional viewers who would tune in specifically for that segment, until the arrangement was mutually terminated on 16 April 2007 following controversy over plans to stage a pre-dawn Anzac Day service in Vietnam. Hockey credits this show for introducing him to an audience who had no interest in politics.

===Opposition===
In December 2007, Hockey was made Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing and Manager of Opposition Business in the House. In September 2008 he became Shadow Minister for Finance, Competition Policy and Deregulation. He became Shadow Treasurer in February 2009 when Julie Bishop stepped down from the portfolio.

Prior to his appointment as shadow treasurer there had been a move to get Hockey to transfer to New South Wales state politics to replace Barry O&#x27;Farrell as state Liberal leader and lead the Coalition to victory at the 2011 state election, which would have made Hockey the Premier of New South Wales. Hockey, however, denied any interest to move into state politics. The push to get Hockey into state politics came to an end when he was promoted to shadow treasurer as that placed him within striking distance of becoming federal leader.

Hockey&#x27;s popularity among voters grew under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull and, in October 2009, polls showed him as the preferred Liberal leader. However, Hockey announced that he had no intention to challenge for the leadership.

On 9 November 2009, Hockey gave a speech, &quot;In Defence of God&quot;, at the Sydney Institute. 
A Newspoll released on 30 November 2009 placed Hockey at 33%, Turnbull at 30% and Tony Abbott at 19%, when voters were asked who would be the &quot;best person to lead&quot; the Liberal Party. Speculation flourished that Hockey would challenge Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party, and Hockey consulted senior party dignitaries such as Howard and Costello about whether he should run.

Hockey faced a dilemma. He had been a consistent supporter of the ETS. Running against Turnbull, a fellow moderate in the Liberal Party, would mean taking the leadership with the support of the party&#x27;s right wing and climate change sceptics.

On 1 December 2009, Hockey chose to include his candidacy in a party room ballot to determine the leadership of the Liberal Party. The ballot was between Hockey, Turnbull and Abbott. Hockey was eliminated in the first round of the ballot, with the eventual winner being Abbott. Following the change of leadership, Hockey remained Shadow Treasurer.

He told ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; audience on 7 March 2011 that corporate Australia had fallen behind in female boardroom representation and if companies failed to meet a reasonable target within a period of time then &quot;more punitive measures&quot; needed to be taken by parliament. He later said that &quot;quotas must be a last resort&quot;.

Hockey gave a speech to the Grattan Institute on 11 March 2010 called &quot;In Defence of Liberty&quot;. The speech defended anti-terrorism laws and rejected a hypothetical bill of rights, while criticising increased police powers. A series of &quot;In Defence...&quot; speeches by Hockey followed over 2010 and 2011: &quot;In Defence of Enterprise&quot; to the EIDOS Institute on 14 April 2010; &quot;In Defence of Opportunity&quot; to the Sydney Institute on 9 March 2011; and &quot;In Defence of Youth&quot; to the University of New England on 27 July 2011. This series of speeches were seen as Hockey&#x27;s bid for the Liberal leadership.

Biographer Madonna King points out &quot;Australia&#x27;s Future Engagement in the Asian Century&quot; (25 October 2011) and &quot;The Future of Free Markets, Global Trade and Commerce&quot; (7 December 2011) as other key speeches from this three-year period of Joe Hockey trying to show what he stood for.

On 17 April 2012, Hockey gave a speech at the Institute of Economic Affairs in London. He warned Australians that the time to become self-sufficient was at hand and that the government could not afford to give &quot;universal payments&quot; to Australians. The speech was controversial in Australia, sparking discussion on the ABC &quot;Lateline&quot; program and an article in &quot;The Australian&quot;. The speech was said to change the public&#x27;s perception of Hockey from &quot;avuncular&quot; to &quot;hard-head&quot;. and foreshadowing Hockey&#x27;s first budget.

On 26 April 2012, Hockey gave a speech, &quot;The Future of Australian Diversity&quot;, at the Islamic Council of Victoria. &quot;To judge Islam based on the actions of extremists and terrorists would be no different than judging Christianity on the actions of those who have over the centuries committed atrocities in the name of Christianity.&quot;

===Abbott government===

The Coalition won government at the 2013 election, and Hockey was named Treasurer.

In 2014, the &quot;end of the age of entitlement&quot; was used to justify the government refusing financial assistance to Holden in South Australia and SPC Ardmona in Victoria and explaining why they could not participate in Barnaby Joyce&#x27;s proposal for a bail out of farmers. Hockey&#x27;s approach has been described by sociology lecturer Verity Archer as being like former US President Richard Nixon&#x27;s, &quot;using claims of a budget emergency&quot; to cut welfare.

In April 2014, Hockey faced criticism for saying &quot;the poorest people either don&#x27;t have cars, or actually don&#x27;t drive very far&quot; when seeking an increase in the fuel excise tax.

In May 2014, Fairfax media published a story stating that political donors to the North Sydney Forum were able to have &quot;VIP&quot; meetings with Hockey, under the title &quot;Treasurer for Sale&quot;.

Hockey delivered the 2014 budget on 13 May 2014. The austere budget faced widespread criticism and was overwhelmingly rejected by the Australian public as reflected in all opinion polls after its release. Michael Pascoe, writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, regards Hockey as being saddled with policies that were fiscally irresponsible, but designed to win support, giving as an example the scrapping of the price on carbon. Hockey was considered by his colleagues to have made a poor case for the economic reforms in the 2014 budget. The Guardian writes that criticism of the budget as &quot;unfair&quot; harmed Hockey&#x27;s public image.

After the February 2015 Liberal party leadership spill motion, there were calls for Hockey to be replaced as Treasurer.

In the lead-up to the 2015 budget, Abbott stated that no matter how the budget was received, Hockey would continue as Treasurer. Hockey delivered the 2015 budget. This was considered a vast contrast to the 2014 budget.

In June 2015, Hockey was criticised over his response to housing affordability issues, where he advised first home buyers to &quot;get a good job that pays good money&quot;.

In August 2015, Peter FitzSimons, chair of the Australian Republican Movement, announced that Joe Hockey would help lead a parliamentary friendship group aimed at a referendum on an Australian republic before 2020. This led to criticism of Hockey by members of the Coalition, who regarded the renewed push for a republic to be a distraction from the government&#x27;s priorities. Later in August, a leak stated that two cabinet ministers were urging Abbott to reassign Hockey as treasurer.

After Malcolm Turnbull ousted Abbott at the 2015 Liberal leadership spill, there was growing speculation that Turnbull would not retain Hockey as Treasurer in his new government, even though as mentioned above they are both members of the Liberal Party&#x27;s moderate wing. Although Turnbull offered Hockey a different role in his government, Hockey declined and on 20 September 2015 announced his intention to leave Parliament. Hockey gave his final speech to parliament on 21 October 2015.

===Parliamentary resignation and US Ambassador role===

Hockey resigned from parliament on 23 October 2015 which triggered the 2015 North Sydney by-election which was won by Trent Zimmerman. It was announced on 8 December 2015 that Hockey would become the next Ambassador of Australia to the United States when Kim Beazley&#x27;s term ended in early 2016. In his new role as Ambassador, Hockey wrote a response to a New York Times editorial about cuts to climate change research at CSIRO. In the first 100 days of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency, Malcolm Turnbull and Trump had a phone conversation regarding the agreement for the US to take detained refugees from Manus Island that Turnbull had struck with Barack Obama. Trump described the deal as &quot;dumb&quot; on Twitter. Hockey met with Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus for discussions.

Hockey&#x27;s term as ambassador was extended for a year but ended on 30 January 2020, and was replaced as ambassador by former Liberal Party Senator Arthur Sinodinos the week after. His farewell party was held on 17 January 2020 in Washington, D.C., and was attended by Abbott and Australian golfer Greg Norman.

==Post-political career==
At the start of 2020, Hockey planned to continue staying and working in the United States for several years after his role as ambassador to the United States. It was previously reported that he was planning to take up a part-time position as a guest lecturer on public policy and politics in an American university.

Hockey made unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the Presidential vote of the 2020 United States elections. Hockey&#x27;s basis for the claim was a 93% Democratic vote in Washington, D.C., where he had been living for several years. However, the Democratic vote in Washington, D.C., regularly reaches the level cited by Hockey. Hockey wrote an opinion piece in The Sydney Morning Herald supporting Joe Biden for President of the United States.

In October 2022 Hockey released his autobiography:

==Personal life==
Hockey met Melissa Babbage, his future wife, in 1991 at a Young Liberals state convention. On 18 December 1994, Hockey married Babbage, an investment banker, later head of foreign exchange and global finance at Deutsche Bank. As of 2014, the couple had three children and lived in Hunters Hill, New South Wales. Upon the birth of his youngest child, Hockey became the first federal Minister to take paternity leave. He has walked the Kokoda Track and has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro to raise funds for medical equipment. Hockey and his wife became owners of a 200 hectare cattle farm in Malanda, near Cairns, Queensland. In 2012, he lost more than 20 kg following gastric sleeve surgery.

In 2014, Hockey launched defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media over an article published in its newspapers, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;, titled &quot;Treasurer for sale&quot;, which he said falsely implied that he accepted bribes paid to influence his decisions and that he corruptly sold privileged access to a select group of Liberal Party donors. A trial was held to determine whether the allegations were defensible in March 2015 in the NSW Supreme Court before Justice Richard White, where Hockey argued that false allegations of the nature contained in the article, and the conduct of Fairfax during the proceedings, evidenced a malicious intent to smear his otherwise good reputation and consequently would justify the award of aggravated damages. Hockey was represented by Bruce McClintock SC. Fairfax was defended by Dr Matt Collins QC. In June 2015, the judge partially ruled in favour of Hockey, ruling that where the headline had been seen without the article, it was defamatory, and awarded Hockey $200,000 in damages. Fairfax was ordered to pay 15% of Hockey&#x27;s court costs.

<text>The Indian roller (Coracias benghalensis) is a bird of the family Coraciidae. It is long with a wingspan of and weighs . The face and throat are pinkish, the head and back are brown, with blue on the rump and contrasting light and dark blue on the wings and tail. The bright blue markings on the wing are prominent in flight. The sexes are similar in appearance. Two subspecies are recognised.

The Indian roller occurs widely from West Asia to the Indian subcontinent. Often found perched on roadside trees and wires, it is common in open grassland and scrub forest habitats, and has adapted well to human-modified landscapes. It mainly feeds on insects, especially beetles. The species is best known for the aerobatic displays of males during the breeding season. Adult males and females form pair bonds and raise the young together. The female lays 3–5 eggs in a cavity or crevice, which is lined with a thin mat of straw or feathers. The roller is the state bird of three Indian states. It is listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Taxonomy==
The Indian roller was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where he coined the binomial name &quot;Corvus benghalensis&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;Jay from Bengal&quot; described and illustrated in 1731 by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin, derived from a drawing by illustrator Joseph Dandridge.

In 1766, Linnaeus described an Indian roller under the name &quot;Coracias indica&quot;, based on a description by George Edwards in 1764 of a specimen collected in Sri Lanka. The latter name was used for many years; Indian ornithologist Biswamoy Biswas suspected it was because Linnaeus&#x27; 12th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; was preferred as the starting point for formal descriptions. German ornithologist Ernst Hartert determined there were distinct northern and southern subspecies and allocated &quot;benghalensis&quot; to the former and &quot;indicus&quot; to the latter. However, Biswas noted that the type locality (where the specimen was originally found) for &quot;benghalensis&quot; was Madras Presidency, which lies within the range of the southern subspecies, and proposed a neotype be selected from Bengal, where Linnaeus had assumed the taxon had come from. This was accepted by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 1962.

Two subspecies are recognized:

* &quot;C. b. benghalensis&quot; occurs from western Asia to India north of the Vindhya Range.
* &quot;C. b. indicus&quot; occurs in central and southern India and in Sri Lanka. It is distinguished by its slightly shorter wing and tail, darker blue crown and upper wing coverts, more brownish mantle and shoulder, and more pronounced red-brown collar on hindneck.
The Indochinese roller (&quot;C. affinis&quot;) was often treated as a subspecies due to some hybridisation between the two taxa over an area from central Nepal to western Assam. However, a 2018 molecular study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA showed that the latter taxon was actually most closely related to the purple-winged roller (&quot;C. temminckii&quot;) while the Indian roller was their next closest relative, diverging from a lineage that gave rise to those two species.


The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union has designated &quot;Indian roller&quot; the official common name for the species. In British India, it was also colloquially termed &#x27;blue jay&#x27;. The Indian roller is called &#x27;Little King&#x27; by villagers in Khuzestan Province in Iran.

==Description==

The Indian roller is a bulky and broad-winged bird with a large head and short neck and legs. It has a body length of with a wingspan of and weighs . The bare skin around the eyes is dull orange, the legs and feet are yellow-brown. The bill is tinged with brown at the base. The iris is grey-brown. 

===Plumage===
The plumage on the forehead, chin and lores are pinkish buff, the ear coverts are darker red-brown with pale cream or pinkish streaks, while the throat is a dull wine-red with narrow cream streaks. The crown and nape are a darker dull turquoise. The back and rump are a bright turquoise, and the belly is pale blue. The tail coverts are dark purple-blue with turquoise tips. The middle two tail feathers are greyish blue-olive with black shafts, while the surrounding tail feathers are an intense purple-blue with a broad pale blue band and greenish tinge towards the tips. The flight feathers on the wings have the same purple-blue colour of those on the tail, with a similar pale blue band across the most distal five or six primaries. The underwing coverts and are pale blue, while the upperwing coverts are a dull green-blue. The primary coverts are pale blue with olive or purple-blue tips, and the lesser coverts are purple-blue along the leading edge of the wing. The colours look dull when the bird is perched but become vibrant in flight. Moulting commences anywhere from mid-June to mid-August and concludes between November and the beginning of March.

The blue colours of the flight feathers are structural and are formed by microstructures in the barbs that produce blue through scattering, which C.V. Raman noted in the 1930s as being more complex than can be explained by the Tyndall effect. Studies in 2010 found the feather barbs structured like a channel with β-keratin rods in diameter with airspaces between them.

Adult males and females are similar in appearance and there are no seasonal changes. Juvenile birds are duller, paler and browner in colour, with a dull green crown and dull green-blue belly tinged with buff. The bill is brown with a yellowish base rather than black.

===Voice===
The Indian roller has a monosyllabic contact call which varies from a short &quot;chack&quot; to a longer, harsher &quot;tschow&quot;. &quot;Kaarsch&quot; calls are made during rolling displays, and increase in frequency and volume as the bird flies towards an intruder. When perched side by side, rollers make staccato chattering. In the nest, young produce a loud, &quot;distressing&quot; sound when calling for food, while young fledglings make a loud &quot;screaming gobble&quot; after eating. Newly independent rollers make cat-like mews while foraging.

===Differences from other species===
At a distance the species can be mistaken for the European roller, which is a migrant through parts of the Indian roller&#x27;s range. The European roller has a longer neck and tail in flight, as well as black primaries and an all-blue head. The Indochinese roller is darker, larger and has a purplish brown and unstreaked face and breast, and blue-green forehead. The underwing coverts are a deeper shade of blue. Its call is higher-pitched and has a more nasal sound.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Indian roller is distributed from Iraq and United Arab Emirates through the Indian subcontinent, including Sri Lanka. In Pakistan, it is resident in the wetlands around Chotiari Dam in Sindh, in Jiwani Coastal Wetland in Balochistan, and in Punjab along the Taunsa Barrage and Chenab River. It has been recorded as a summer visitor to Jalalabad in northeastern Afghanistan. It has been recorded as a vagrant in Syria,Saudi Arabia, Masirah Island, Qatar, Yemen, Socotra, Bahrain, where it was sighted in 1996 and in 2008, Lakshadweep islands, the Maldive Islands, and Turkey.
In Kuwait, it is a common winter visitor at Green Island and farmlands near Al Jahra.
In the 1970s, it was reported as a common winter visitor to the marshes and mudflats of Shadegan County in Iran. However, it is listed as resident in Iran.

The species is common, and often found in open woodland dominated by trees of the genera &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Prosopis&quot;, and has adapted well to human-modified landscapes such as parks and gardens, fields, date and coconut palm plantations. It has been nicknamed &quot;roundabout bird&quot; in northern Oman, where pairs live in vegetation at roundabouts. In Oman, it is common in the Al Batinah Region and in cultivated areas east of the Sharqiya Sands below elevations of . In India, it was sighted at elevations ranging from sea level in the Bhitarkanika Mangroves and the Gulf of Mannar to about in the Nilgiri Mountains.

==Behaviour and ecology ==
The Indian roller is generally not very gregarious and is usually found alone or in pairs. It is often territorial, though migrants may forage in flocks with no aggression. They patrol their territory by flying at treetop height or three-stories high and when an intruder is spotted, they drive it away by a fast rolling flight. Its migration patterns are not well understood; in Oman they are present year-round but appear to be more common in winter than summer.

The Indian roller spends a few minutes preening followed by flying around its roosting site. It favours electric or telegraph wires as perches. It has been observed perching in trees and shrubs at a height of from where it flies down to forage for ground insects. It also uses higher perches in the upper canopy of trees. The display of the Indian roller is aerobatic with twists and turns. It is attracted by wildfires and darts into hot smoke in pursuit of insects. It has been observed following tractors for disturbed invertebrates. In agricultural habitats in southern India, it has been found at densities of about 50 birds per km2.

Nesting Indian rollers act aggressively towards potential predators. They drive away Indian jungle crows (&quot;Corvus culminatus&quot;) from nests and have even been recorded repeatedly divebombing an Egyptian vulture (&quot;Neophron percnopterus&quot;), and flying at humans.

&quot;Haemoproteus coraciae&quot; live inside the red-blood cells and &quot;Leucocytozoon&quot; blood parasites have been recorded in the lung tissues. Parasitic helminth worms &quot;Hadjelia srivastavai, Cyrnea graphophasiani,&quot; &quot;Habronema thapari&quot; and &quot;Synhimantus spiralis&quot; have been recorded from the gizzards of Indian rollers.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is March to June, slightly earlier in southern India, when adult males and females form pair bonds. During courtship, mates perform aerial displays which include steep, undulating flights, somersaults, nose-drives, hovering and lateral rolling. This is accompanied by vocalizations. The pair then perch and display to each other with bows, dropped wings and fanned tails and may engage in allopreening. The nest site is usually an existing hole in a tree, a dead palm or building but may also be a hole in a mud bank. The hole may be excavated completely in soft material such as rotten wood. A thin mat of feathers, straw or grass is placed at the bottom of the cavity. In Bandhavgarh National Park, nests have been recorded at heights of in &quot;Shorea robusta&quot; trees and above the ground in &quot;Syzygium cumini&quot; trees. 

The clutch consists of 3–5 eggs, which are white and oval with an average size of . The eggs are incubated mainly by the female beginning as soon as the first egg is laid and hatch asynchronously after 17 to 19 days. The young are naked when first hatched and are fed and cared for by both parents. The fledging period lasts 30 to 35 days.

===Food and feeding===
The Indian roller descends to the ground to capture insects and to a lesser extent amphibians, reptiles, birds, and small mammals. It is attracted to swarms of winged termites; as many as 40 birds have been seen to perch on a stretch of electric wire to hunt them. Beetles make up around 45% of its diet, followed by grasshoppers and crickets at around 25%. 

The Indian roller often associates with the great Indian bustard (&quot;Ardeotis nigriceps&quot;), catching insects flushed out by the latter species. In Tamil Nadu, it was observed to forage mainly by gleaning (catching prey on a surface), followed by feeding on the ground and in the air. It occasionally dives into water to take frogs and fish, much like a kingfisher. It may make use of opportunities such as insects attracted to lights, feeding even late after dusk.

In March 2019, an Indian roller was observed feeding on an Indian wolf snake (&quot;Lycodon aulicus&quot;) in Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary.

==Conservation==

In India, the Indian roller received legal protection in 1887, when hunting it was banned under the Wild Birds Protection Act of 1887 and later under the Wild Birds and Animals Protection Act of 1912. In Iran, the Indian roller is protected by the Islamic code, but not listed as protected by law.

As of 2016, the Indian roller was listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List, due to its wide range and apparent increasing population. The total population size is unknown, but it appears to be common in most of its range. As of 2015, about 2,500 breeding pairs were estimated to live in Iraq and 15,000 breeding pairs in the Arabian Peninsula; the population was thought to have increased in particular in the United Arab Emirates.

=== Threats ===
The numbers of Indian roller sighted along the highway between Aligarh and New Delhi decreased between the mid 1960s and mid 1980s, as traffic increased during that time. Its habit of feeding near roadsides sometimes results in collisions with traffic. Its habit of utilizing powerlines puts it at risk of electrocution. In Rajasthan, it was found to be the second most commonly electrocuted bird after the house crow (&quot;Corvus splendens&quot;).

==In culture==

The Indian roller is associated with Hindu legends and said to be sacred to Vishnu; it used to be caught and released during festivals such as Dussera or the last day of Durga Puja. Adding its chopped feathers to fodder for cows was believed to increase the latter&#x27;s milk yield, giving it the Telugu name of &quot;paala-pitta&quot; (), meaning &#x27;milk bird&#x27;. A Hindustani name is &quot;neelkanth&quot; (; ), meaning &#x27;blue throat&#x27;, a name associated with the deity Shiva due to a legend that he drank the Halahala poison emerging from Samudra Manthana to save the world but stopped it from going past his throat, turning it blue. 

The Kol people traditionally considered a sighting of an Indian roller as a good omen as did people in Bengal who, upon seeing the bird, would chant a couplet showing devotion to Vishnu and seeking a vision of the bird at the time of their death. A nomadic tribe of fortune-tellers from the Vishakapatnam area wore feathers of the Indian roller on their head utilizing the folk belief that the bird could foretell events. The Indian roller is the state bird of the Indian states of Odisha, Telangana, and Karnataka.

At the height of the plume trade in the early 20th century, the Indian roller was sought for export of its colourful feathers, and was among the most widely killed bird species in India.

<doc id="566190" wikidata="Q4355403" url="?curid=566190" title="Dot and the Kangaroo">
<text>Dot and the Kangaroo is an 1899 Australian children&#x27;s book written by Ethel C. Pedley about a little girl named Dot who gets lost in the Australian bush and is eventually befriended by a kangaroo and several other marsupials. The book was adapted into a stage production in 1924, and a film in 1977.

==Plot summary==
A 5-year-old girl named Dot is lost in the bush after chasing a hare into the wood and losing sight of her home. She is approached by a grey kangaroo who gives her some berries to eat. Upon eating the berries, Dot is able to understand the language of all animals, and she tells the kangaroo her plight. The kangaroo, who has lost her own joey, decides to help little Dot despite her own fear of humans. They consult the platypus (who insists on being called Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus) and he tells them that Willy Wagtail will be able to help her. After much adventure, including being hunted by Aborigines and Dot being on trial in an animal court, Dot and her kangaroo finally find her home, and the kangaroo finds her joey there.
==Film adaptations==

A film adaptation was released in 1977 directed by Yoram Gross. It combines animation with live action.

<doc id="566191" wikidata="Q285857" url="?curid=566191" title="Distcc">
<text>In software development, distcc is a tool for speeding up compilation of source code by using distributed computing over a computer network. With the right configuration, distcc can dramatically reduce a project&#x27;s compilation time.

It is designed to work with the C programming language (and its derivatives like C++ and Objective-C) and to use GCC as its backend, though it provides varying degrees of compatibility with the Intel C++ Compiler and Sun Microsystems&#x27; Sun Studio Compiler Suite. Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, distcc is free software.

==Design==

distcc is designed to speed up compilation by taking advantage of unused processing power on other computers. A machine with distcc installed can send code to be compiled across the network to a computer which has the distccd daemon and a compatible compiler installed.

distcc works as an agent for the compiler. A distcc daemon has to run on each of the participating machines. The originating machine invokes a preprocessor to handle header files, preprocessing directives (such as codice_1) and the source files and sends the preprocessed source to other machines over the network via TCP either unencrypted or using SSH. Remote machines compile those source files without any local dependencies (such as libraries, header files or macro definitions) to object files and send them back to the originator for further compilation.

distcc version 3 supports a mode (called &quot;pump mode&quot;) in which included header files are sent to the remote machines,
so that preprocessing is also distributed.

==Related software==
distcc was an option for distributed builds in versions of Apple&#x27;s Xcode development suite prior to 4.3, but has been removed.

=== Goma ===
Goma is a similar tool made by Google to replace distcc &amp; ccache in compiling chromium.

=== Ccache ===
ccache is another tool aimed to reduce the compilation time by caching the output from the same input source files. ccache can also use distcc as its backend, providing distributed compiling if it is not already cached by using the CCACHE_PREFIX environment variable.

=== Icecream ===
icecream was created by SUSE based on distcc. Like distcc, icecream takes compile jobs from a build and distributes it among remote machines allowing a parallel build. But unlike distcc, icecream uses a central server that dynamically schedules the compile jobs to the fastest free server.

<text>A branding iron is used for branding, pressing a heated metal shape against an object or livestock with the intention of leaving an identifying mark.

==History==
The history of branding is very much tied to the history of using animals as a commodity. The act of marking livestock with fire-heated marks to identify ownership begins in ancient times with the ancient Egyptians. The process continued throughout the ages, with both Romans and American colonists using the process to brand slaves as well.

In the English lexicon, the Germanic word &quot;&quot; originally meant anything hot or burning, such as a &quot;fire-brand&quot;, a burning stick. By the European Middle Ages it commonly identified the process of burning a mark into a stock animals with thick hides, such as cattle, so as to identify ownership under animus revertendi. In England, the rights of common including the common pasture system meant that cattle could be grazed on certain land with commoner&#x27;s rights and the cattle were branded to show ownership, often with the commoner&#x27;s or Lord of the manor&#x27;s mark. The practice was widespread in most European nations with large cattle grazing regions, including Spain. 

With colonialism, many cattle branding traditions and techniques were spread via the Spanish Empire to South America and to countries of the British Empire including the Americas, Australasia &amp; South Africa where distinct sets of traditions and techniques developed respectively.

In the Americas these European systems continued with English tradition being used in the New England Colonies and spread outwards with the western expansion of the U.S. The Spanish system evolved from the south with the &quot;vaquero&quot; tradition in what today is the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The branding iron consisted of an iron rod with a simple symbol or mark which was heated in a fire. After the branding iron turned red-hot, the cowhand pressed the branding iron against the hide of the cow. The unique brand meant that cattle owned by multiple owners could then graze freely together on the commons or open range. Drovers or cowboys could then separate the cattle at &quot;roundup&quot; time for driving to market.

==Types of branding irons==
Branding Irons come in a variety of styles, designed primarily by their method of heating.

===Fire-heated===
The traditional fire-heated method is still in use today. While they require longer lengths of time to heat, are inconsistent in temperature and all around inferior to more advanced forms of branding, they are inexpensive to produce and purchase. Fire-heated branding irons are used to brand wood, steak, leather, livestock and plastics.

===Electric===
Electric branding irons utilize an electric heating element to heat a branding iron to the desired temperature. Electric branding irons come in many variations from irons designed to brand cattle, irons designed to mark wood and leather and models designed to be placed inside a drill press for the purposes of manufacturing. An electric branding iron’s temperature can be controlled by increasing or decreasing the flow of electricity.

===Propane===
Propane Branding Irons use a continuous flow of propane to heat the iron head. They are commonly used where electricity is not available. Utilizing the flow of propane, the temperature can be adjusted for varying branding environments.

A commercially built branding iron heater fired with L.P. gas is a common method of heating several branding irons at once.

===Freeze-branding===

In stark contrast to traditional hot-iron branding, freeze branding uses an iron that has been chilled with a coolant such as dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Instead of burning a scar into the animal&#x27;s skin, a freeze brand damages the pigment-producing hair cells, causing the animal&#x27;s hair to grow back white within the branded area. This white-on-dark pattern is prized by cattle ranchers as its contrast allows some range work to be conducted with binoculars rather than individual visits to every animal. To apply a freeze brand the hair coat of the animal is first shaved very closely so that bare skin is exposed. Then the frozen iron is pressed to the animal&#x27;s bare skin for a period of time that varies with both the species of animal and the color of its hair coat. Shorter times are used on dark-colored animals, as this causes follicle melanocyte death and hence permanent pigment loss to the hair when it regrows. Longer times, sometimes as little as five seconds more, are needed for animals with white hair coats. In these cases the brand is applied for long enough to kill the cells of the growth follicle, those that create the hair filaments themselves. This leaves the animal permanently bald in the branded area. The somewhat darker epidermis then contrasts well with a pale animal&#x27;s coat.

==Popular use==

===Livestock===
Livestock branding is perhaps the most prevalent use of a branding iron. Modern use includes gas heating, the traditional fire-heated method, an iron heated by electricity (electric cattle branding iron) or an iron super cooled by dry ice (freeze branding iron). Cattle, horses and other livestock are commonly branded today for the same reason they were in Ancient times, to prove ownership.

===Wood branding===
Woodworkers will often use Electric or Fire-Heated Branding Irons to leave their maker&#x27;s mark or company logo. Timber pallets and other timber export packaging is often marked in this way in accordance with ISPM 15 to indicate that the timber has been treated to prevent it carrying pests.

===Steak===
Steak branding irons are used commonly by barbecue enthusiasts and professional chefs to leave a mark indicating how well done a steak is or to identify the chef or grill master.

===Leather===
Branding Irons are used often by makers of horse tack often in place of a steel leather stamp to indicate craftsmanship.

<text>The Abyssinian roller (Coracias abyssinicus), or Senegal roller, is a member of the roller family of birds which breeds across tropical Africa in a belt south of the Sahara, known as the Sahel. It is resident in the southern part of its range, but northern breeding populations are short-distance migrants, moving further south after the wet season.

==Taxonomy==
==Description==
The Abyssinian roller is a large bird, nearly the size of a jackdaw at . It has a warm brown back, with the rest of the plumage mainly blue. Adults have long tail streamers. Sexes are similar, but the juvenile is a drabber version of the adult. Abyssinian roller is striking in its strong direct flight, with the brilliant blues of the wings contrasting with the brown back and the long tail streamers trailing behind. The call of the Abyssinian roller is a harsh crow-like &quot;gak&quot; sound, or a screeched &quot;aaaargh&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Abyssinian roller is native to tropical Africa. Its range extends from southern Mauritania and Senegal in the west and to Ethiopia, Somalia and northern Kenya in the east. It also occurs in south-western Saudi Arabia and western Yemen. This is a common bird of warm open country with some trees, and has adapted to farmland and human habitation.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Abyssinian rollers often perch prominently on trees, posts or overhead wires, like giant shrikes, whilst watching for the large insects and small rodents on which they feed. They will dash into the smoke of a forest fire for disturbed invertebrates. They are fearless, and will dive and roll at humans and other intruders. The display of this bird is a lapwing-like display, with the twists and turns that give this group its English name. It nests in a scantily lined hole in a tree or building, and lays three to six eggs.

==Status==
The population trend for the Abyssinian roller is thought to be upward, as it exploits the opportunities provided by modern agricultural practices and urbanization. It has an extensive range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

<text>The N Seoul Tower (), officially the YTN Seoul Tower and the Namsan Tower, is a communication and observation tower located on the summit of Namsan (262m) in central Seoul, South Korea. The structure marks the second highest point in Seoul and is considered a local landmark.

Built in 1971, N Seoul Tower is South Korea&#x27;s first general radio wave tower, providing TV and radio broadcasting in Seoul. Currently, the tower broadcasts signals for Korean media outlets, such as KBS, MBC, and SBS.

== History of the Seoul Tower ==
Built in 1969 at a cost of approximately , the tower was completed on 3 December 1971, designed by architects at Jangjongryul, though at the time the observatory was not built, and the tower was only used for transmission purposes, primarily to block North Korean television and radio from reaching Seoul. The observatory was built in 1975, but was not opened due to national security concerns, as the presidential residence at the time, the Blue House, was visible from the observatory, with President Park Chung Hee even saying &quot;Songaksan is visible from there? If so, then the Blue House would be visible too, right?&quot;. Even today, telescopes are not mounted in the general direction of the Blue House. Since opening to the public in October 1980, the tower has been a landmark of Seoul. Tower elevation ranges from at the base to above sea level. It was renamed to &quot;N Seoul Tower&quot; in 2005, with the &#x27;N&#x27; standing for &#x27;new&#x27;, &#x27;Namsan Mountain&#x27;, and &#x27;nature&#x27;. Approximately was spent in renovating and remodeling the tower, also in 2005. 

When N Seoul Tower&#x27;s original owner merged with CJ Corporation, it was renamed the &quot;N Seoul Tower&quot; (official name &quot;CJ Seoul Tower&quot;). YTN acquired it from CJ Corporation in 1999, and changed its name to &quot;YTN Seoul Tower&quot;. It has also been known as the &quot;Namsan Tower&quot; and &quot;Seoul Tower&quot;. It is also Korea&#x27;s first general radio wave tower that holds transmissions antennas of KBS, MBC, SBS TV, FM, PBC, TBS, CBS, and BBS FM.

N Seoul Tower, along with Changdeokgung, was selected as one of the world&#x27;s top 500 tourist destinations in Lonely Planet&#x27;s Ultimate Travel List.

== Floors and amenities ==
N Seoul Tower is divided into three main sections called &quot;N Lobby&quot;, &quot;N Plaza&quot; and &quot;N Tower&quot;. The N Plaza section comprises two floors, while the N Tower section comprises four floors. There are three observation decks throughout the building, although the restaurant on the third floor (3F) and the revolving restaurant on the top floor (7F) offer views comparable to those of the observation decks on the fourth (4F) and fifth (5F) floors.

=== N Lobby ===
The lobby has the entrance to the observatory, an information desk, a museum, a cafe, children&#x27;s theatre, and a nursing room.

=== N Plaza ===
N Plaza has two floors. The first floor (&quot;1F&quot;) includes the ticket booth, a souvenir shop, a cafe and a burger shop, whereas the second floor (&quot;2F&quot;) houses an Italian restaurant and a roof terrace. The &quot;Locks of Love&quot; are situated within the roof terrace.

=== N Tower ===
The N Tower section has four floors: &quot;3F&quot;, &quot;4F&quot;, &quot;5F&quot;, and &quot;7F&quot;. Unlike most buildings in South Korea that do not have a fourth floor due to Tetraphobia (similar to Triskaidekaphobia), N Seoul Tower does but avoids Tetraphobia by including the &#x27;F&#x27; suffix for &#x27;floor&#x27; in the floor name. Note that there is no sixth floor.

Most of the city of Seoul can be seen from the N Tower section, although a lattice transmission tower is situated approximately east of N Seoul Tower. The third floor (3F) of N Seoul Tower has a Korean restaurant called &quot;Hancook&quot;, and a digital observatory with a 360° panoramic view that showcases Korea&#x27;s history through 32 LCD screens. Floors 4F and 5F have observation decks and gift shops. The seventh floor (7F) has a French restaurant, which rotates at a rate of one revolution every 48 minutes.

== Attractions ==

=== Visiting ===

Many visitors ride the Namsan cable car up Namsan Mountain to walk to the tower. The tower is renowned as a national landmark and for its cityscape views. The tower sits on the Namsan Mountain (). It attracts thousands of tourists and locals every year, especially during nighttime when the tower lights up. Photographers enjoy the panoramic view the tower offers. Each year, approximately 8.4million visit the N Seoul Tower, which is surrounded by many other attractions South Korea offers, including Namsan Park and Namsangol Hanok Village. Visitors may go up the tower for a fee that differs for the following groups: children, elderly and teenagers, and adults. Rates also differ for packages and group size.

In 2012, surveys conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government revealed foreign tourists ranked the N Seoul Tower as the number one tourist attraction. The N Seoul Tower is now also a symbol of Seoul.

=== Lighting of the Tower ===
The N Seoul Tower is illuminated in blue from sunset to 11pm (10pm in winter) on days that the air quality in Seoul does not exceed as measured by fine dust concentration. During the spring of 2012, the tower was lit up for 52 days, which is four days more than in 2011. The tower uses the latest LED technology to offer visitors a digital, cultural art experience through &#x27;light art.&#x27; The N Seoul Tower puts on many different shows, including the &quot;Reeds of Light&quot; and &quot;Shower of Light.&quot;

An exception to this is Earth Hour. During Earth Hour, lights are turned off nationwide to promote energy conservation awareness. At N Seoul Tower, lights are turned off in support of Earth Hour at 8pm.

=== Love Padlocks ===
In a poll of nearly 2,000 foreign visitors conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in November 2011, 16 percent stated that hanging named padlocks on the tower fence as a symbol of love was their favorite activity in Seoul. This attraction is situated on the 2nd floor of the N Plaza, at the Roof Terrace. The &quot;Locks of Love&quot; is a popular location for people to hang locks that symbolize eternal love, and has been depicted in many Korean television shows, dramas, and movies for this reason.

&#x27;Love padlocks&#x27; is a common couple activity that involves purchasing of a padlock and key, where initials, messages and symbols can be personally inscribed onto the surface of the lock with markers and pens. Securing the padlocks on the fences filled with locks of previous participants, the key is often thrown away as a symbol of everlasting love. This is similar to the love locks in Paris, France, on the Pont Neuf bridge.

=== Wishing Pond and Observatory ===
The N Tower also holds many other attractions including the digital observatory and the Wishing Pond. The Wishing Pond can be found on the second floor of the tower, where people throw coins into the pond while making a wish. The coins are collected and donated to help develop schools in China and Southeast Asia, especially in underdeveloped areas. The observatory, renovated in 2011, is on the third floor. The observatory not only offers a 360° view of the city, but also exhibits 600 years of Korean history through 36 LCD screens. The fifth floor houses a French restaurant known as N Grill.

=== Other events and attractions ===
In 2008, the Teddy Bear Museum was opened at the tower, with a Christmas tree made with 300 teddy bears to celebrate its opening. It showcases teddy bears in the past, present, and future of Seoul, as well as teddy bears models in Seoul attractions, such as the Cheonggyecheon Stream, Myeongdong, Insadong, and Dongdaemun.

=== Displays of 55-inch OLED Panels ===
OLED panels are displayed all around the Namsan Seoultower from level 1 to 4. On level 1, guests will be greeted by a OLED tunnel with welcome messages, and a curved panorama OLED display with a view of the Gwanghwamun Gate and Gyeongbokgung Palace through the four seasons. On level 2, we can see the OLED circle, shaped like a round belt hanging in the air. On level 4, there is a wavy structure decorated with images of wish lanterns, flames and patterns of dancheong to represent beautiful sky across Seoul. And next, we can experience &#x27;3D video world&#x27;.

<text>Dale Arden is a fictional character, the fellow adventurer and love interest of Flash Gordon and a prototypic heroine for later female characters, including Princess Leia and Padmé Amidala in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Flash, Dale and Dr. Hans Zarkov fight together against Ming the Merciless.

== Profile ==
Dale is Flash Gordon&#x27;s constant companion in his adventures, as well as his one true love. The emperor Ming the Merciless is immediately attracted to her and the early strips were essentially based on Flash&#x27;s heroic efforts to rescue Dale from Ming&#x27;s many attempts to marry her.

Filmation&#x27;s Flash Gordon&#x27;s Bible portrayed Dale Arden as follows:

==Alex Raymond&#x27;s comic strip==
Dale Arden is introduced in the first &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; story, July 7, 1934, as simply &quot;a passenger&quot; on the plane Flash is flying on. After the plane is hit by a meteor, Flash saves Dale by parachuting to the ground. The two are then abducted by Dr. Zarkov, who takes them on his rocket to the planet Mongo. In the 1930s comic strips, Dale often comes into conflict with other female characters who desire Flash romantically (such as Princess Aura and Queen Azura).

==Comic books==
In the 2011 Dynamite Comics &quot;Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist&quot;, Dale Arden is a cartographer and researcher for the State Department in 1934. As in Raymond&#x27;s original story, she and Flash are abducted by Zarkov and brought to Mongo. In the later Dynamite Comics &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; series, Dale Arden is a modern-day science journalist with a special interest in the space program, as well as a feminist. She travels with Zarkov and Flash on the former&#x27;s Z-Plane to Mongo.

==In other media==
*Dale&#x27;s broadcast debut was in a Hearst Radio series that ran from April to October 1935. The actress who played her is unknown.
*Dale was first portrayed on film by Jean Rogers in the film serials &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1936) and &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars&quot; (1938).
*In the 1940 serial, &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot;, Dale was portrayed by Carol Hughes.
*Irene Champlin took the role for the 1954 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; television series. Champlin was praised for transforming Arden from the typical damsel in distress of the serials into a trained scientist and a &quot;quick thinker who often saved [Flash and Zarkov] from perishing&quot;.
* Meltem Mete portrayed in Dale in the 1967 Turkish film &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Battle in Space&quot; (AKA &quot;Baytekin – Fezada Çarpisanlar&quot; in Turkish). Here Dale is depicted as a spy who helps Flash.
*Diane Pershing provided the voice for the character in the 1979 Filmation series. Filmation&#x27;s version of the character was a newspaper reporter.
*In 1980, Dale was portrayed by Melody Anderson in the film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, produced by Dino De Laurentiis. In this version of the story, Dale is a New York travel agent.
*During the course of the 1980s Marvel animated series &quot;Defenders of the Earth&quot;, Dale is captured and killed by Ming, but her consciousness is left trapped inside a crystal Flash uses to power the Defenders&#x27; base on Earth, Monitor. Dale is reborn as the heart of the base, Dynak.
*Lexa Doig voiced Dale in the 1996 animated series &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;.
*Gina Holden portrayed Dale in the 2007 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; television series.

== Parodies ==
*In the 1974 adult film spoof &quot;Flesh Gordon&quot;, the character is renamed Dale Ardor and is portrayed by Cindy Hopkins, aka Suzanne Fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlSeries/Festivals - Movies - Riverfront Timespage 1 - Riverfront Times&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>The Hillbrow Tower (officially the Telkom Joburg Tower, and formerly JG Strijdom Tower) is a tall tower located in the suburb of Hillbrow in Johannesburg, South Africa. At , it was the tallest tower in Africa for 50 years, until it was surpassed in 2021 by the Iconic Tower in Egypt&#x27;s New Administrative Capital, as well as the continent&#x27;s tallest structure for eleven years, until overtaken by the Nador transmitter in Morocco; it remained Africa&#x27;s tallest free-standing structure for two more years until overtaken by the chimney of the Sasol III Steam Plant in 1984. For seven years it was also the tallest structure in the Southern Hemisphere until 1978, when surpassed by the 270 m Mount Isa Chimney in Queensland, Australia. It remains the tallest telecommunications tower in Africa. Construction of the tower began in June 1968 and was completed three years later, in April 1971. Construction cost 2 million rand (at the time, US$2.8 million). The tower was initially known as the &quot;JG Strijdom Tower&quot;, after JG (Hans) Strijdom, South African Prime Minister from 1954 to 1958. On 31 May 2005 it was renamed the &quot;Telkom Joburg Tower&quot;.

The tower was constructed for South African Posts &amp; Telecommunications, which later became Telkom, South Africa&#x27;s government-run and largest telecommunications company. As the general height of buildings rose in the central business district, it became necessary that the height of the new telecommunications tower stayed above the height of the buildings surrounding it.

== Tourist attraction ==
The Hillbrow Tower has been closed to visitors since 1981, primarily for security reasons. Before the closure, the Hillbrow tower was one of the largest tourist draws in Johannesburg. The public was able to enter six public floors at the top of the tower. One of the floors housed a popular revolving restaurant named &quot;Heinrich&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; and a discotheque named &quot;Cloud 9&quot; as well as another non-rotating restaurant known as &quot;the Grill Room&quot; and the observation floor which was at 197 m height.

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, a huge football was fitted to the tower to celebrate the event. In 2013, television programme &quot;Carte Blanche&quot; broadcast from what used to be the revolving restaurant.

The Hillbrow Tower is one of two iconic towers that are often used to identify the Johannesburg skyline. The second tower, the Sentech Tower (old Albert Hertzog Tower), is used for television and radio transmissions.

<doc id="566221" wikidata="Q7636585" url="?curid=566221" title="Sultan (chimpanzee)">
<text>Sultan, one of the brightest of the early chimpanzees used for psychological research, was tested by Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler. Sultan is particularly recognized for his insight in solving numerous problems, including stacking or manipulating boxes to reach a reward and use of two sticks as a unit to rake food to a reachable distance.

While other Chimpanzees in Köhler&#x27;s study were also quite adept at problemsolving—namely, obtaining an out-of-reach fruit suspended above a playground or perched just beyond arm&#x27;s reach outside the bars of a cage—Sultan proved to be peculiarly advanced. He and his peers were also known to stack crates to reach the fruit, and even scramble up a hastily balanced stick to grab the banana before falling back down.

Chimpanzees helped Köhler to prove that animals are capable of learning beyond simple trial and error, and that, given the right conditions, many species—particularly the more &quot;human&quot; species of primates—will demonstrate a deeper understanding of the constituents of a problem. For example, several chimpanzees who had proven capable of reaching the banana via a stack of crates found that in a crateless room, a table or chair worked to meet the same end.

<text>The blue-bellied roller (Coracias cyanogaster) is a member of the roller family of birds which breeds across Africa in a narrow belt from Senegal to northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is resident, apart from some local seasonal movements, in mature moist savannah dominated by &quot;Isoberlinia&quot; trees.

==Taxonomy==
The blue-bellied roller was given the binomial name &quot;Coracias cyanogaster&quot; in 1816 by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier based on &quot;Le Rollier à ventre bleu&quot; that had been described and illustrated by François Levaillant in 1806. The specific epithet combines the Ancient Greek &quot;kuanos&quot; meaning &quot;dark-blue&quot; with &quot;gastēr&quot; meaning &quot;belly&quot;. Levaillant mistaken believed that the specimen had been collected on the island of Java. The species is resident in West-Africa and the type location was later designated as Senegal. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The blue-bellied roller is a large bird, nearly the size of a jackdaw at . It has a very dark brown back, buffy or chalky white head, neck and breast, with the rest of the plumage mainly blue. Adults have tail streamers. Sexes are similar, but the juvenile is a drabber version of the adult.

The blue-bellied roller is striking in its strong direct flight, with the brilliant blues of the wings contrasting with the dark back and cream colored head, and the tail streamers trailing behind.

The call of blue-bellied roller is a harsh clicking &quot;ga-ga-ga&quot; sound.
==Distribution and habitat==
This is a common bird of warm open country with some trees. These rollers often perch prominently on trees, posts, or overhead wires, like giant shrikes, whilst watching for the grasshoppers and other large insects on which they feed.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The display of this bird is a lapwing-like display, with the twists and turns that give this species its English name. It nests in a hole in a tree - a tree cavity.

==Status==
Widespread and common throughout its large range, the blue-bellied roller is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

==In captivity==
The blue-bellied roller is kept in some zoos, open air aviaries and similar educational facilities. There are instances of the bird escaping captivity and adjusting to the local environment. In Nepalganj area of Joka, Kolkata, two blue-bellied rollers have been spotted since May 2023 that have adapted to the local environment.

<doc id="566231" wikidata="Q559811" url="?curid=566231" title="Microexpression">
<text>A microexpression is a facial expression that only lasts for a short moment. It is the innate result of a voluntary and an involuntary emotional response occurring simultaneously and conflicting with one another, and occurs when the amygdala responds appropriately to the stimuli that the individual experiences and the individual wishes to conceal this specific emotion. This results in the individual very briefly displaying their true emotions followed by a false emotional reaction.

Human emotions are an unconscious biopsychosocial reaction that derives from the amygdala and they typically last 0.5–4.0 seconds, although a microexpression will typically last less than 1/2 of a second. Unlike regular facial expressions it is either very difficult or virtually impossible to hide microexpression reactions. Microexpressions cannot be controlled as they happen in a fraction of a second, but it is possible to capture someone&#x27;s expressions with a high speed camera and replay them at much slower speeds. Microexpressions express the seven universal emotions: disgust, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, contempt, and surprise. Nevertheless, in the 1990s, Paul Ekman expanded his list of emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions not all of which are encoded in facial muscles. These emotions are amusement, embarrassment, anxiety, guilt, pride, relief, contentment, pleasure, and shame.

==History==
Microexpressions were first discovered by Haggard and Isaacs. In their 1966 study, Haggard and Isaacs outlined how they discovered these &quot;micromomentary&quot; expressions while &quot;scanning motion picture films of psychotherapy for hours, searching for indications of non-verbal communication between therapist and patient&quot; Through a series of studies, Paul Ekman found a high agreement across members of diverse Western and Eastern literate cultures on selecting emotional labels that fit facial expressions. Expressions he found to be universal included those indicating anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Findings on contempt are less clear, though there is at least some preliminary evidence that this emotion and its expression are universally recognized. Working with his long-time friend Wallace V. Friesen, Ekman demonstrated that the findings extended to preliterate Fore tribesmen in Papua New Guinea, whose members could not have learned the meaning of expressions from exposure to media depictions of emotion. Ekman and Friesen then demonstrated that certain emotions were exhibited with very specific display rules, culture-specific prescriptions about who can show which emotions to whom and when. These display rules could explain how cultural differences may conceal the universal effect of expression.

In the 1960s, William S. Condon pioneered the study of interactions at the fraction-of-a-second level. In his famous research project, he scrutinized a four-and-a-half-second film segment frame by frame, where each frame represented 1/25th second. After studying this film segment for a year and a half, he discerned interactional micromovements, such as the wife moving her shoulder exactly as the husband&#x27;s hands came up, which combined yielded rhythms at the micro level.

Years after Condon&#x27;s study, American psychologist John Gottman began video-recording living relationships to study how couples interact. By studying participants&#x27; facial expressions, Gottman was able to correlate expressions with which relationships would last and which would not. Gottman&#x27;s 2002 paper makes no claims to accuracy in terms of binary classification, and is instead a regression analysis of a two factor model where skin conductance levels and oral history narratives encodings are the only two statistically significant variables. Facial expressions using Ekman&#x27;s encoding scheme were not statistically significant. In Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s book &quot;Blink&quot;, Gottman states that there are four major emotional reactions that are destructive to a marriage: defensiveness which is described as a reaction toward a stimulus as if you were being attacked, stonewalling which is the behavior where a person refuses to communicate or cooperate with another, criticism which is the practice of judging the merits and faults of a person, and contempt which is a general attitude that is a mixture of the primary emotions disgust and anger. Among these four, Gottman considers contempt the most important of them all.

A 2024 study investigated the impact of then-President Donald Trump&#x27;s televised COVID-19 address on viewers&#x27; emotions, with a focus on his micro-expressions. Researchers found that a specific micro-expression of fear in Trump&#x27;s address was perceived by his supporters as an authentic emotional cue, enhancing their connection to the speech, indicating that subtle nonverbal cues can influence emotional responses based on political alignment.

==Types==
Microexpressions are typically classified based on how an expression is modified. They exist in three groups:
*Simulated expressions: when a microexpression is not accompanied by a genuine emotion. This is the most commonly studied form of microexpression because of its nature. It occurs when there is a brief flash of an expression, and then returns to a neutral state.
* Neutralized expressions: when a genuine expression is suppressed and the face remains neutral. This type of micro-expression is not observable due to the successful suppression of it by a person.
*Masked expressions: when a genuine expression is completely masked by a falsified expression. Masked expressions are microexpressions that are intended to be hidden, either subconsciously or consciously.

==In photographs and films==
Microexpressions can be difficult to recognize, but still images and video can make them easier to perceive. In order to learn how to recognize the way that various emotions register across parts of the face, Ekman and Friesen recommend the study of what they call &quot;facial blueprint photographs&quot;, photographic studies of &quot;the same person showing all the emotions&quot; under consistent photographic conditions. However, because of their extremely short duration, by definition, microexpressions can happen too quickly to capture with traditional photography. Both Condon and Gottman compiled their seminal research by intensively reviewing film footage. Frame rate manipulation also allows the viewer to distinguish distinct emotions, as well as their stages and progressions, which would otherwise be too subtle to identify. This technique is demonstrated in the short film Thought Moments by Michael Simon Toon and a film in Malayalam Pretham 2016 Paul Ekman also has materials he has created on his website that teach people how to identify microexpressions using various photographs, including photos he took during his research period in New Guinea.

==Moods vs emotions==
Moods differ from emotions in that the feelings involved last over a longer period. For example, a feeling of anger lasting for just a few minutes, or even for an hour, is called an emotion. But if the person remains angry all day, or becomes angry a dozen times during that day, or is angry for days, then it is a mood. Many people describe this as a person being irritable, or that the person is in an angry mood. As Paul Ekman described, it is possible but unlikely for a person in this mood to show a complete anger facial expression. More often just a trace of that angry facial expression may be held over a considerable period: a tightened jaw or tensed lower eyelid, or lip pressed against lip, or brows drawn down and together.
Emotions are defined as a complex pattern of changes, including physiological arousal, feelings, cognitive processes, and behavioral reactions, made in response to a situation perceived to be personally significant.

==Controlled microexpressions==
Facial expressions are not just uncontrolled instances. Some may in fact be voluntary and others involuntary, and thus some may be truthful and others false or misleading. Facial expression may be controlled or uncontrolled. Some people are born able to control their expressions (such as pathological liars), while others are trained, for example actors. &quot;Natural liars&quot; may be aware of their ability to control microexpressions, and so may those who know them well; they may have been &quot;getting away&quot; with things since childhood due to greater ease in fooling their parents, teachers, and friends. People can simulate emotion expressions, attempting to create the impression that they feel an emotion when they are not experiencing it at all. A person may show an expression that looks like fear when in fact they feel nothing, or perhaps some other emotion. Facial expressions of emotion are controlled for various reasons, whether cultural or by social conventions. For example, in the United States many little boys learn the cultural display rule, &quot;little men do not cry or look afraid&quot;. There are also more personal display rules, not learned by most people within a culture, but the product of the idiosyncrasies of a particular family. A child may be taught never to look angrily at his father, or never to show sadness when disappointed. These display rules, whether cultural ones shared by most people or personal, individual ones, are usually so well-learned, and learned so early, that the control of the facial expression they dictate is done automatically without thinking or awareness.

== Emotional intelligence ==
Involuntary facial expressions can be hard to pick up and understand explicitly, and it is more of an implicit competence of the unconscious mind. Daniel Goleman created a conclusion on the capacity of an individual to recognize their own, as well as others&#x27; emotions, and to discriminate emotions based on introspection of those feelings. This is part of Goleman&#x27;s emotional intelligence. In E.I, attunement is an unconscious synchrony that guides empathy. Attunement relies heavily on nonverbal communication. Looping is where facial expressions can elicit involuntary behavior. In the research motor mimicry there shows neurons that pick up on facial expressions and communicate with motor neurons responsible for muscles in the face to display the same facial expression. Thus displaying a smile may elicit a micro expression of a smile on someone who is trying to remain neutral in their expression.
Through fMRI we can see the area where these Mirror neurons are located lights up when you show the subject an image of a face expressing an emotion using a mirror. In the relationship of the prefrontal cortex also known as the (executive mind) which is where cognitive thinking experience and the amygdala being part of the limbic system is responsible for involuntary functions, habits, and emotions. The amygdala can hijack the pre-frontal cortex in a sympathetic response. In his book &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot; Goleman uses the case of Jason Haffizulla (who assaulted his high school physics teacher because of a grade he received on a test) as an example of an emotional hijacking in which rationality and better judgement can be impaired. This is one example of how the bottom brain can interpret sensory memory and execute involuntary behavior. This is the purpose of microexpressions in attunement and how you can interpret the emotion that is shown in a fraction of a second. The microexpression of a concealed emotion that&#x27;s displayed to an individual will elicit the same emotion in them to a degree, this process is referred to as an emotional contagion.

== MFETT and SFETT ==
Micro Facial expression training tools and subtle Facial expression training tools are software made to develop someone&#x27;s skills in the competence of recognizing emotion. The software consists of a set of videos that you watch after being educated on the facial expressions. After watching a short clip, there is a test of your analysis of the video with immediate feedback. This tool is to be used daily to produce improvements. Individuals that are exposed to the test for the first time usually do poor trying to assume what expression was presented, but the idea is through the reinforcement of the feedback you unconsciously generate the correct expectations of that expression. These tools are used to develop rounder social skills and a better capacity for empathy. They are also quite useful for development of social skills in people on the autism spectrum. Lie detection is an important skill not only in social situations and in the workplace, but also for law enforcement and other occupations that deal with frequent acts of deception. Microexpression and subtle expression recognition are valuable assets for these occupations as it increases the chance of detecting deception. In recent years it was found that the average person has a 54% accuracy rate in terms of exposing whether a person is lying or being truthful. However, Ekman had done a research experiment and discovered that secret service agents have a 64% accuracy rate. In later years, Ekman found groups of people that are intrigued by this form of detecting deception and had accuracy rates that ranged from 68% to 73%. Their conclusion was that people with the same training on microexpression and subtle expression recognition will vary depending on their level of emotional intelligence.

==Lies and leakage==
The sympathetic nervous system is one of two divisions under the autonomic nervous system, it functions involuntarily and one aspect of the system deals with emotional arousal in response to situations accordingly. Therefore, if an individual decides to deceive someone, they will experience a stress response within because of the possible consequences if caught. A person using deception will typically cope by using nonverbal cues which take the form of bodily movements. These bodily movements occur because of the need to release the chemical buildup of cortisol, which is produced at a higher rate in a situation where there is something at stake. The purpose for these involuntary nonverbal cues are to ease oneself in a stressful situation. In the midst of deceiving an individual, leakage can occur which is when nonverbal cues are exhibited and are contradictory to what the individual is conveying. Despite this useful tactic of detecting deception, microexpressions do not show what intentions or thoughts the deceiver is trying to conceal. They only provide the fact that there was emotional arousal in the context of the situation. If an individual displays fear or surprise in the form of a microexpression, it does not mean that the individual is concealing information that is relevant to investigation. This is similar to how polygraphs fail to some degree: because there is a sympathetic response due to the fear of being disbelieved as innocent. The same goes for microexpressions, when there is a concealed emotion there is no information revealed on why that emotion was felt. They do not determine a lie, but are a form of detecting concealed information. David Matsumoto is a well-known American psychologist and explains that one must not conclude that someone is lying if a microexpression is detected but that there is more to the story than is being told. Matsumoto was also the first to publish scientific evidence that microexpressions may be a key to detecting deception.

Despite the prevailing belief among law enforcement and the public that micro-expressions are able to reveal whether a person is being deceitful, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this claim. Research has shown that there is often a disconnect between displayed emotions and felt emotions; in short, deception does not necessarily produce negative emotions and negative emotions do not necessarily signal deception. In addition, microexpressions do not occur often enough to be useful. In one of the few studies of microexpressions, researchers found that only 2% of emotional expressions coded could be considered microexpressions and they appeared equally for truth-tellers and liars. Other studies have found that liars and truth-tellers exhibit different responses than expected: in a concealed information test, Pentland and colleagues found that liars showed less contempt and more intense smiles than truthful people. This counters the fundamental idea behind microexpressions, which suggests that it is impossible for a liar to conceal their true nature, as evidence of their guilt &quot;leaks&quot; out through these expressions. Taken together, their findings suggest that micro-expressions do not occur frequently enough to be detectable, neither are they consistent enough to distinguish liars from truth-tellers.

==Universality==

A significant amount of research has been done in respect to whether basic facial expressions are universal or are culturally distinct. After Charles Darwin had written &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; it was widely accepted that facial expressions of emotion are universal and biologically determined. Many writers have disagreed with this statement. David Matsumoto however agreed with this statement in his study of sighted and blind Olympians. Using thousands of photographs captured at the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Matsumoto compared the facial expressions of sighted and blind judo athletes, including individuals who were born blind. All competitors displayed the same expressions in response to winning and losing. Matsumoto discovered that both blind and sighted competitors displayed similar facial expression, during winnings and loss. These results suggest that our ability to modify our faces to fit the social setting is not learned visually. Matsumoto also has training tools he has created on his website that teaches people how to identify micro and subtle facial expressions of emotion.

==In popular culture==

Microexpressions and associated science are the central premise for the 2009 television series &quot;Lie to Me&quot;, based on discoveries of Paul Ekman. The main character uses his acute awareness of microexpressions and other body language clues to determine when someone is lying or hiding something.

They also play a central role in Robert Ludlum&#x27;s posthumously published &quot;The Ambler Warning&quot;, in which the central character, Harrison Ambler, is an intelligence agent able to recognize them. Similarly, one of the main characters in Alastair Reynolds&#x27; science fiction novel, &quot;Absolution Gap&quot;, Aura, can easily read microexpressions.

In &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, the main character, Patrick Jane, can often tell when people are being dishonest. However, specific reference to microexpressions is only made once in the 7th and final season.

In the 2015 science fiction thriller &quot;Ex Machina&quot;, Ava, an artificially intelligent humanoid, surprises the protagonist, Caleb, in their first meeting, when she tells him &quot;Your microexpressions are telegraphing discomfort.&quot;

==Controversy==
Though the study of microexpressions has gained popularity through popular media, studies show it lacks internal consistency in its conceptual formation.

Maria Hartwig, professor of Psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, argues that it has led to wrongful imprisonment of suspects who were aggressively interrogated due to perceived micro expressions. 

A 2016 article in &quot;Nature&quot; explains that it is possible to mask involuntary expressions with fake expressions, and that in real world situations, over 40% of the time we can not tell the difference. 

Judee K. Burgoon argues in a 2018 &quot;Frontiers in Psychology&quot; opinion that micro expressions theory presumes that people feel detectible emotions always connected to the same thoughts or motivations. But what if, for example, people feel happy rather than guilty about deceiving others? Burgoon also cites studies showing that micro-expressions are rare:In one of the very few investigations of microexpression frequency, Porter and ten Brinke (2008) coded 700 high-stakes genuine and falsified emotional expressions and found only 2% were microexpressions.and that they seldom result in arrests when implemented at places like airports:testimony to the U.S. Congress revealed that only 0.6% out of 61,000 passenger referrals to law enforcement in 2011 and 2012 resulted in arrests (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2013)

<text>Time of Judgment is a series of roleplaying game scenario books for the World of Darkness settings of White Wolf Game Studio. These scenarios are presented as the semi-canonical endings of the original World of Darkness, as preparation for the new version of the setting. As the Time of Judgment approaches, vampires cease to exist, werewolves fight their last battle against the Wyrm, and mages face their last test.

The series ran for four hardback books; one for &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot; respectively, with the fourth book delegated to each of the remaining settings. Each setting received between three and six potential scenarios.

==Roleplaying scenario books==

===&quot;Vampire: Gehenna&quot;===

&quot;Vampire: Gehenna&quot;, released in January 2004, began the Time of Judgment chronicle, providing four different scenarios and tips for Storytellers to end their &quot;&quot; game sessions. Its scenarios are;

* &quot;Wormwood&quot;, which is similar to the biblical story of Noah&#x27;s ark, in which God silently eradicates vampiric life from Earth. The focus is on character interaction as the Player Characters are among the sole survivors in an abandoned sanctuary, as all other vampiric forms are cleansed, with the Player Characters given a chance to interact with each other, reconcile and turn to God before 40 Nights are over.
* &quot;Fair is Foul&quot;, which concerns the mythology of Lilith and the struggles of her own descendants against those of her enemy, Caine.
* &quot;Nightshade&quot;, a large-scale story which follows up on many metaplot hooks such as the rising of the antediluvian and rebirth of Saulot.
* &quot;Crucible of God&quot;, is best described as a post-apocalyptic monster epic, with the antediluvian having completely rewritten the world to their ideals.

===&quot;Werewolf: Apocalypse&quot;===

&quot;Werewolf: Apocalypse&quot;, released in February 2004, providing four different scenarios for &quot;&quot; game sessions.

* &quot;The Last Battleground&quot; covered the apocalypse as a great battle, taking place in the spirit realm, where the players would seek for any support before the final battle.
* &quot;A Tribe Falls&quot; covers what events could occur if one of the existing thirteen tribes fell &#x27;to the wyrm&#x27;, like the Black Spiral Dancer tribe.
* &quot;Weaver Ascendant&quot; essentially places the Weaver as the source of all problems in the cosmos, and throws the characters into conflict with it.
* &quot;Ragnarok&quot; outlines what would happen if a giant asteroid were to collide with the world, igniting an apocalyptic war with the forces of the Wyrm.

===&quot;Mage: Ascension&quot;===

&quot;Mage: Ascension&quot;, released in March 2004, providing five different scenarios for &quot;&quot; game sessions.

* &quot;Judgment&quot;, the most metaplot-heavy of the lot, features many current strands (rogue councils, forgotten traditions, the avatar storms), which ultimately leads to all characters ascending while the universe becomes one great singularity.
* &quot;The Revolution Will Be Televised&quot; outlines a civil war in the Technocracy, with a view from the inside.
* &quot;The Earth Will Shake&quot; outlines what would happen if a giant asteroid were to collide with the world, in a different manner to the event in Werewolf.
* &quot;A Whimper, Not A Bang&quot; dealt with a threat from an alien lifeform, which had not previously been mentioned within the game for many years. These creatures are gradually consuming the world&#x27;s magic, not much affecting humans but essentially producing the extinction of mages.
* &quot;Hell On Earth&quot; outlined what would happen were the Nephandi to win the battle and bring chaos to the world.

===&quot;Time of Judgment&quot;===

&quot;World of Darkness: Time of Judgment&quot;, also released in March 2004, covered &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Kindred of the East&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, with each receiving between three and four scenarios. &quot;Orpheus&quot; also got its final book, &quot;End Game&quot; in 2004, but it was not considered part of the Time of Judgment. &quot;&quot; had already ended in 1999 due to lack of sales.

==Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre==

&quot;Laws of Judgment&quot; ended the &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre&quot; line of World of Darkness live-action role-playing games. &quot;Laws of Judgment&quot; is a condensed adaptation of the Time of Judgment books, as well as the final &quot;Wraith: The Oblivion&quot; book, &quot;Ends of Empire&quot;. &quot;Laws of Judgment&quot; omitted the &quot;Rising of Mount Meru&quot; scenario for &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; (from &quot;World of Darkness: Time of Judgment&quot;), on the grounds that its themes did not fit with those of &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre&quot;, as well as the entire &quot;&quot; scenario from &quot;World of Darkness: Time of Judgment&quot;, as &quot;Demon&quot; was never adapted to &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre&quot; format.

==Novels==

There are also three fiction novels that picture the end of times for &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, respectively. These novels are &quot;Gehenna&quot;, &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, and &quot;Judgment Day&quot;. None of these are considered to be the canonical ending of the line, as the storylines are left open for each group to end them as they please.

<doc id="566242" wikidata="Q1415630" url="?curid=566242" title="Filth Pig">
<text>Filth Pig is the sixth studio album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released on January 30, 1996, by Warner Bros. Records. The title was allegedly derived from a statement made in the British Houses of Parliament, in which the band&#x27;s leader Al Jourgensen was described as a &quot;filthy pig&quot; for his onstage theatrics by MP Teddy Taylor.

Despite being the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in the US, it was negatively received by reviewers, sharply divided the band&#x27;s fanbase, and did not live up to the platinum-selling success of &quot;Psalm 69.&quot; Despite poor sales, the album entered several charts, peaking at the highest positions Ministry has ever achieved. This would be the last Ministry album with Mike Scaccia on guitar until 2004&#x27;s &quot;Houses of the Molé&quot;.

== Background ==
&quot;Filth Pig&quot; marked a major shift artistically for the band from their previous album. Jourgensen said everyone around him wanted him to continue making music similar to &quot;Psalm 69&quot;. However, he wanted to move away from using samples and focus on a slower, heavier sound. Jourgensen rejected any songs that sounded like their previous work. 

The 2002 live album &quot;Sphinctour&quot; was generally well received by critics.

<text>An open relationship is an intimate relationship that is sexually or romantically non-monogamous. An open relationship generally indicates a relationship where there is a primary emotional and intimate relationship between partners, who agree to at least the possibility of sexual or emotional intimacy with other people. The term &quot;open relationship&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with the term polyamory, but the two concepts are not identical. 

Open relationships include any type of romantic relationship (dating, marriage, etc.) that is open. 
An &quot;open&quot; relationship means one or more parties have permission to be romantically or sexually involved with people outside of the relationship. This is opposed to the traditionally &quot;closed&quot; relationship, where both parties agree on being with one another exclusively. The concept of an open relationship has been recognized since the 1970s.

==Types==
To a large degree, open relationships are a generalization of the concept of a relationship beyond monogamous relationships. A form of open relationship is the open marriage, in which the participants in a marriage have an open relationship.

There are several different styles of open relationships. Some examples include:

* Multi-partner relationships, between three or more partners where a sexual relationship does not occur between all of the parties involved.
* Hybrid relationships, when one partner is nonmonogamous and the other is monogamous.
* Swinging, in which singles or partners in a committed relationship engage in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity.

The main unifying element to open relationship styles is non-exclusivity of romantic or sexual relationships. Another generic term for all these types of relationships is open love.

===Swinging===

Swinging is a form of open relationship in which the partners in a committed relationship engage in sexual activities with others at the same time. Swingers may regard the practice as a recreational or social activity that adds variety or excitement into their otherwise conventional sex lives or for curiosity. Swingers who engage in casual sex maintain that sex among swingers is often more frank and deliberative and therefore more honest than infidelity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship.

===Open marriage===

An open marriage, sometimes referred to as consensual non-monogamy or CNM, is a type of marriage wherein the involved parties unequivocally consent to their partners entering or engaging in romantic and/or sexual relationships with other people.

===Polyamory===
Polyamory is the practice, desire, or acceptance of having more than one intimate relationship at a time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. While &quot;open relationship&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;polyamory&quot; or &quot;polyamorous relationship&quot;, the terms are not synonymous; polyamorous people may choose between open relationships or polyfidelity. The &quot;open&quot; in &quot;open relationship&quot; refers to the sexual aspect of a relationship, whereas &quot;polyamory&quot; refers to allowing bonds to form (which may be sexual or otherwise) as additional long-term relationships.

The terms &quot;polyamory&quot; and &quot;friends with benefits&quot; are fairly recent, having come about within the past few decades though the concept is as old as society.

==Prevalence==

Some believe that open relationships occur more frequently in certain demographics, such as the young rather than the old in America, including, more specifically, the college-educated middle-class rather than the uneducated working-class, or people of certain ethnic and/or other racial minorities. According to the 2012 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, 4% of respondents reported being in an open relationship. It was also found that males and LGB individuals are more likely to report being in an open relationship, with 33% of gay men, 23% of bisexual men, 5% of lesbian females, and 22% of bisexual females reporting an open relationship.

A 1974 study showed that male students who either cohabit or live in a communal group are more likely to become involved in open relationships than females, and are still more interested in the concept than females even if not participating in open relationships. A survey taken by gay men&#x27;s &quot;health and life magazine&quot;, &quot;FS Magazine&quot;, of the 1,006 gay men they surveyed 41% are in, or have previously experienced, an open relationship. Of the men who are in an open relationship, 75% believe that open relationships are great.

Many couples within open relationships are dual-career, meaning that both primary partners have a stable job and/or a career. Both men and women in these, especially in closed groups, are also more likely to be in managerial jobs. Most also are either childfree, or post child-rearing.

==Reward vs. risk==
===Reasons for entering an open relationship===

An open relationship may form for various reasons. These include:
* liking another person but not wanting to end the old relationship
* pressure or coercion from the partner wishing for an open relationship
* being non-monogamous by nature (i.e. born that way)
* a difference emerging between two people in a relationship
* one partner realizing that they are unable to fulfill the other&#x27;s needs
* varying sex drive between partners
* one or both partners desiring more freedom, companionship, intellectual variety, a variety of sexual partners, getting ahead career-wise or maintaining relationships
* a need for challenge: some people feel that their relationship is inadequate unless they are being challenged. Open relationships may create a sense of jealousy, attachment, or possessiveness, all of which are challenges for a relationship to work through. These emotions can also lead to greater self-awareness which may be seen as satisfying to those in open relationships. Some research has found that individuals in open relationships report less jealousy compared to those in monogamous relationships.
* the enjoyment of new relationship energy, the state of heightened emotional and sexual receptivity and excitement experienced during the formation of a new physical relationship
* being able to meet other couples and individuals with a similar outlook with whom the participants can connect with on an intellectual and emotional level
* being in a relationship of convenience, that is, one that is not primarily based on mutual feeling of love towards each other (anymore), but rather on economic or social factors (e.g.: the traditional practice of polyandry in rural Tibet)
* distance – when partners live in separate parts of the world for part or all of the time
* sex may be more pleasing, and the participants may engage in it more frequently than those in an average couple
* issues with sexual compatibility
* increased trust that comes with boundary setting and communication
* increased intimacy that comes with open discussion around sexual desires and experiences

“It has been proposed that men (both gay and straight), in contrast to women, are able to cognitively separate sex from emotions (or love) in a process commonly termed compartmentalization.&quot; This means it is not unusual for homosexual men to have open relationships, which means breaking the ‘norm’ of a committed and ‘typical’ heterosexual relationship. That is not to suggest that open relationships do not work; research has shown comparable relationship satisfaction for both monogamous and non-monogamous couples. However, it could be that there is a lack of emotional investment in the relationship that makes it harder to navigate through tough times.

===Reasons for avoiding an open relationship===
Many couples consider open relationships, but choose not to follow through with the idea. If a person attempts to approach their committed monogamous partner about transitioning to an open relationship, the monogamous partner may convince or coerce them to either stay monogamous or pursue a new partner. There may also be concern that when beginning an open relationship, a partner may become only concerned in their personal development and pay less attention to their partner.

Jealousy is often present in monogamous relationships, and adding one or more partners to the relationship may cause it to increase. Results of some studies have suggested that jealousy remains a problem in open relationships because the actual involvement of a third party is seen as a trigger. In Constantine &amp; Constantine (1971), the researchers found that 80% of participants in open marriages had experienced jealousy at one point or another.

Consensual nonmonogamous relationships have negative stereotypes around them, including less sexually fulfilling, more sexually risky, and less moral. These stereotypes are reinforced by mononormativity, which is the belief that monogamous relationships are the most natural and culturally acceptable relationship.

Cultural pressure may also dissuade initiating or switching to an open relationship. There is a commonly held societal stereotype that those involved in open relationships are less committed or mature than those who are in monogamous relationships. Films, media, and self-help books present the message that to desire more than one partner means not having a &quot;true&quot; relationship. In the post-WWII 1950s-1970s, it was traditional to &quot;date around&quot; (with guidelines such not going out with one particular suitor twice in a row) until ready to start &quot;going steady&quot; (the onset of exclusivity and sexual exploration); since then, non-exclusive dating around has lost favour and going directly to steady (now known simply as exclusive dating) has been elevated instead. Desiring an open relationship in these days often claimed to be a phase that a person is passing through before being ready to &quot;settle down&quot;. The logistics of an open relationship may be difficult to cope with, especially if the partners reside together, split finances, own property, or parent children.

==== Sexually transmitted infection ====

Any sexual contact outside of a strictly monogamous or polyfidelitous relationship increases the possibility that one member of the group will contract a sexually transmitted infection and pass it into the group.

Neither barrier device use (such as condoms) nor more vigilant STI testing and vaccination can fully eliminate such risk, but can reduce the statistical increase attributable to nonmonogamy. Nevertheless, using data from the 2012 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, Levine et al. (2018) found that individuals in open relationships reported more condom use in both vaginal and anal intercourse compared to monogamous couples.

The development of PrEP has led to a decrease in risk for HIV infection by as much as 92%. If both partners are on PrEP, risk of HIV infection is diminished, even if there are multiple partners.

==Successful open relationships==
One of the most significant factors that aids a relationship in being successful is that it is about making the relationship fit the needs of all parties involved. No two open relationships will be the same, and the relationship will change due to the current circumstances at each specific moment. The style of the open relationship will mirror the parties&#x27; involved values, goals, desires, needs and philosophies.

The most successful relationships have been those that take longer to establish. By taking the time to develop a clear idea of what both partners want out of the openness of a relationship, it allows the parties involved to self-reflect, process their emotions, deal with possible conflicts, and (for those transitioning from monogamy to nonmonogamy) find ways to cope with the change.

Negotiating the details of the open relationship is important throughout the communication process. Topics that are commonly found in negotiations between couples include honesty, the level of maintenance, trust, boundaries and time management.

Other tools that couples utilize in the negotiation process include allowing partners to veto new relationships, prior permission, and interaction between partners. This helps to reassure each partner in the relationship that their opinion is important and matters. However, although ability to veto can be a useful tool in negotiation, a successful negotiation and open relationship can still occur without it. Some reject veto power because they believe it limits their partner from experiencing a new relationship and limits their freedom.

===Boundaries===
Types of boundaries include physical, which is along the lines of not touching someone without permission being given; sexual boundaries; and emotional boundaries, which is avoiding the discussion of specific emotions. Boundaries help to set out rules for what is and is not acceptable to the members of the relationship. They also help people to feel safe and that they are just as important in the open relationship as their partners.

Examples of boundaries that are set could include:
* Who (geographically and interpersonally, such as in the community, friends, family, et cetera) could be an additional partner;
* What types of physical limits are placed on that relationship (kissing, dating, or other sexual activities);
* Whether sexual relations will take place in a separate bedroom, playroom or premises (e.g. hotel).

Some couples create a physical relationship contract. These can be useful in not only negotiating, but also clearly articulating the needs, wants, limits, expectations, and commitments that are expected of the parties involved.

===Time management===
Adequate time management can contribute to the success of an open relationship. Even though having a serious commitment with one partner is common, negotiating the time spent among all partners is still important. Although the desire to give an unlimited amount of love, energy, and emotion to others is common, the limited amount of time in a day limits the actual time spent with each partner. Some find that if they cannot evenly distribute their time, they forego a partner. Time management can also be related to equity theory, which stresses the importance of fairness in relationships.

==Research on open marriages==
===Positive outcomes===
Published 1974, a national study of sexuality conducted by Hunt found that relatively few people engage in swinging. Hunt attributed the low number of people in these open marriages to various social, psychological, and practical problems. Yet, some of these people &quot;confirmed what the advocates and enthusiasts have claimed—namely, that marital swinging can provide physically intense experiences, that it can be immensely ego-gratifying and that it is a temporary release from confinement and responsibility and a brief chance to live out one&#x27;s wildest fantasies&quot; (pages 273–274).

Some studies show that couples in open marriages can maintain satisfying relationships. Rubin observed no differences in marital adjustment between couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous marriages. Rubin and Adams reported no differences in marital satisfaction between couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous relationships. Gilmartin likewise found no differences in marital satisfaction between sexually open and sexually monogamous couples. A study by Bergstrand and Willams found couples in open marriages had higher levels of satisfaction than couples in the general population.

Some couples in open marriages report high levels of satisfaction with their relationships. A study conducted by Wolf found that 76 percent of couples in open marriages described the quality of their relationships as &quot;better than average&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot;. Dixon found similarly high levels of marital satisfaction in a study of 100 bisexual and heterosexual husbands in open marriages. In another study, Dixon observed that 80 percent of wives in open marriages rated their marital compatibility as &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, and 76 percent of the wives rated their sexual satisfaction as &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. Buunk has also reported high levels of satisfaction in couples in open marriages. 
Some couples feel open marriage has increased their marital satisfaction. Bergstrand and Williams collected online questionnaires from 1092 people involved in swinging style open marriages. 
Among those people who said they were &quot;somewhat unhappy&quot; or &quot;unhappy&quot; with their marriages before swinging, around 80–90 percent said they were happier with their marriages after they started swinging. Nearly half of people who said they were &quot;very happy&quot; with their marriages before swinging claimed to be even happier with their marriages after swinging. Open marriage can in some cases increase marital satisfaction.

===Neutral outcomes===
Couples sometimes drop out of the open marriage lifestyle and return to sexual monogamy. In a five-year study of bisexuals, 80 percent of whom initially had open relationships, Martin Weinberg, Colin J. Williams, and Douglas Pryor observed a definite shift towards sexual monogamy over time. When first interviewed, a majority of these bisexuals preferred sexual non-monogamy as their ideal form of romantic relationships. Five years later, around 60 percent had changed their views, and most of those who changed their views said sexual monogamy was their new ideal. Some of these changes were motivated by the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. Monogamy was seen as a way to avoid getting HIV/AIDS. But, for many, the shift to monogamy was due to a genuine change in what they sought in relationships. Their desire to be sexually monogamous had nothing to do with the AIDS epidemic.

Couples who try open marriages and decide to return to sexually monogamous marriages may be left with different feelings about open marriage. Some may have negative feelings about their open marriage experiences. Others may continue to &quot;see nonmonogamy as possibly good for others but not for themselves&quot;. Overall, open marriage has a relatively neutral impact on these couples. Rubin and Adams did not observe any difference in the risk of divorce for couples in open marriages and couples in sexually monogamous marriages.

===Negative outcomes===
Couples in open marriages expose themselves to the potential for conflicts caused by jealousy. Studies have shown that 80 percent or more of couples in open marriages experience jealousy over their extramarital relationships. Jealousy with its roots in open marriage can lead to serious conflicts. For example, attempting to interfere with a rival relationship may make a partner angry. Insulting or berating a partner may provoke retaliatory responses. Demanding greater commitment may ignite arguments. Indeed, many studies have reported that conflict occurs during episodes of jealousy. The conflicts caused by jealousy can seem overwhelming and damage relationships.

Even when jealousy is not an overwhelming problem, open relationships may cause other complications. Numerous authors have argued that open marriages disrupt relationships by interfering with intimacy and provoking insecurities.

Some couples report that open marriage contributed to their divorces. Janus and Janus asked divorced people to list the one primary reason for their divorces. Approximately 1 percent of men and 2 percent of women listed open marriage as the primary reason for their divorce. This seems like a small percentage, but keep in mind that only 1 to 6 percent of the population have open marriages. Open marriage is perceived as a primary cause of divorce in a substantial minority of the 1 to 6 percent of people who have open marriages.

The extent to which open marriage actually contributes to divorce remains uncertain. Blumstein and Schwartz note a slightly higher risk of divorce among couples who engage in extramarital sex, even if the couples agree to allow extramarital sex.

<text>Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) is the primary television, radio and digital public broadcasting network for most of the U.S. state of Oregon as well as southern Washington. OPB consists of five full-power television stations, dozens of VHF or UHF translators, and over 20 radio stations and frequencies. It also streams its programming on the Internet. Broadcasts include local and regional programming as well as television programs from the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and American Public Television (APT), and radio programs from National Public Radio (NPR), American Public Media (APM), Public Radio Exchange (PRX), and the BBC World Service, among other distributors. Its headquarters and television studios are located in Portland, Oregon.

OPB has been a major producer of television programming for national broadcast on PBS and Create through distributors like APT, with shows such as &quot;History Detectives&quot;, &quot;Barbecue America&quot;, &quot;Foreign Exchange&quot;, &quot;Rick Steves&#x27; Europe&quot;, and travel shows hosted by Art Wolfe.

The part of southwestern Oregon not served by OPB is served by KLCC radio, Jefferson Public Radio, and Southern Oregon PBS.

==History==
===20th century===

OPB traces its roots back to January 23, 1923, when KFDJ signed on from the Oregon State University campus in Corvallis. From 1923 to 1981, the Oregon State campus served as the radio and later TV base of operations for Oregon&#x27;s public broadcasting. Charles B. Mitchel, a first-year speech professor at Oregon State, was instrumental in bringing Oregon&#x27;s first public radio station to the state. OSU physics instructor Jacob Jordan is credited with building the station&#x27;s first radio transmitter near campus in 1923. 

The radio station&#x27;s call letters were changed to KOAC on December 11, 1925. In 1932, KOAC became a service of the Oregon State Board of Higher Education General Extension Division.

During the mid-1950s, the university constructed KOAC&#x27;s first TV studios inside Gill Coliseum. On October 7, 1957, the station began television broadcasting as KOAC-AM-TV. For nearly 60 years, faculty and students at Oregon State University broadcast news, information and entertainment programming across the state from the Corvallis studios. First known as Oregon Educational Broadcasting, the public network became the Oregon Educational and Public Broadcasting Service (OEPBS) in 1971. 

KOAC won its first Peabody Award for Outstanding Public Service by a Local Station in 1942 for &quot;Our Hidden Enemy, Venereal Disease&quot;. KOAC won a second Peabody Award in 1972 for &quot;Conversations with Will Shakespeare and Certain of His Friends&quot;.


In the late 1950s, KOAC&#x27;s broadcast signal was shared across the state by microwave transmitters and receivers. KOAC also added satellite studios for radio broadcasting in Eugene, Monmouth, Salem, and Portland. In the 1960s, satellite TV studios were added in Portland and Eugene. The Portland satellite, KOAP-FM-TV, was located in a leased building at what is now 2828 SW Naito Parkway. KOAP started broadcasting on February 6, 1961. The Eugene satellite was located on the University of Oregon campus, in Villard Hall. Up until 1965, all programs from the KOAC satellites were live, due to a lack of video recording equipment. Both studios operated two RCA TK31 cameras for live broadcasts. 

On December 6, 1964, KTVR-TV began broadcasting in La Grande. The station started primarily as a commercial television station, affiliated with NBC and ABC. KTVR-TV operated as a semi-satellite of KTVB in Boise, Idaho. The La Grande studio was located at 1605 Adams Ave. and produced nightly newscasts and other local programming. However, by 1967, the La Grande studio and office were closed and KTVR became a full-fledged satellite of KTVB. KTVR was unique in the Pacific Time Zone, because as a repeater of a Mountain Time Zone station, its &quot;prime time&quot; schedule was broadcast from 6 to 9 p.m. OEPBS bought KTVR on August 31, 1976, and converted it to PBS on February 1, 1977. At first, KTVR rebroadcast programming from two Washington stations—KWSU-TV in Pullman and KSPS-TV in Spokane—until OEPBS completed a transmission link to La Grande. On September 1, 1977, OEPBS took KTVR off the air for transmitter repairs, due to increasing technical problems. KTVR returned to the air on January 1, 1978, carrying OEPBS programming for the first time.
KOAB-TV in Bend began broadcasting on February 24, 1970, as KVDO-TV, a commercial independent station licensed to Salem. Channel 3 struggled to compete with Portland&#x27;s established independent, KPTV (channel 12), and in 1972, the station was purchased by Liberty Communications, then-owners of Eugene&#x27;s ABC affiliate KEZI (channel 9). The intention was to make KVDO a full-power satellite of KEZI. During the sale, KATU (channel 2), Portland&#x27;s ABC affiliate, objected over duplication of programming, and there were also objections to Liberty&#x27;s common ownership of local cable systems and the television station. As a result, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed Liberty to buy KVDO-TV on the condition that it sell the station within three years.

The state government approved the purchase of KVDO-TV in 1975, with OEPBS taking control of the station on February 19, 1976. Nine days later, on February 28, a disgruntled viewer protesting KVDO&#x27;s sale to OEPBS cut guy wires, toppling the channel 3 transmitter tower. On September 20, 1976, KVDO signed back on the air with a new tower; from then until March 31, 1981, the station broadcast an alternate program lineup to KOAP-TV and KOAC-TV, featuring time-shifted OEPBS programs, shows for the Spanish-speaking population in the Willamette Valley, and several local productions in Salem. OEPBS consistently eyed moving the station elsewhere to reduce duplication, which became more acute when budget cuts prompted KVDO-TV to drop its separate programs in 1981. The network pursued and won approval from the FCC to move the channel 3 allocation and license to Bend, which had no PBS coverage. KVDO-TV ceased broadcasting in Salem on July 31, 1983; on December 22, channel 3 signed back on the air as KOAB. The call letters were modified to KOAB-TV when KOAB-FM signed on the air on January 23, 1986.

KEPB-TV in Eugene began operation on February 27, 1990, as Eugene&#x27;s first public television station, bringing most of Eugene a clear signal for PBS programming for the first time ever. Although KOAC-TV had long claimed Eugene as part of its primary coverage area (Corvallis is part of the Eugene market), it only provided rimshot coverage to most of Eugene itself and was marginal at best in the southern portion of the city. Most of Eugene could only get a clear picture from KOAC-TV on cable.

In 1981, OEPBS was spun off from the Oregon State System of Higher Education and became a separate state agency, Oregon Public Broadcasting. As part of the network overhaul, KOAP became the flagship of the OPB network and central operations were relocated from Corvallis to Portland.

In the early 2000s, OPB installed Oregon&#x27;s first digital transmitter, taking a critical first step in the digital television transition.

===21st century===
For 2001 and 2002, the Oregon state government provided about 14 percent of OPB&#x27;s operational budget; for 2003 and 2004, it was cut to 9 percent.

On December 4, 2007, OPB launched opbmusic, a 24-hour online radio channel spotlighting Pacific Northwest musicians. As of December 11, 2020, OPB discontinued the opbmusic HD radio and online audio stream and integrated opbmusic multimedia content into its broader arts and culture reporting.

In March 2009, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting chose OPB to manage the pilot version of American Archive, CPB&#x27;s initiative to digitally preserve content created by public broadcasters.

==Television stations==
Notes:
==Cable and satellite availability==
OPB Television is available on all cable providers in its service area. On Dish Network, KOPB-TV, KEPB-TV, and KOAB-TV are available on the Portland, Eugene and Bend local broadcast station lineups, respectively. KOPB-TV and KEPB-TV are available on the Portland and Eugene DirecTV broadcast station lineups.

==Digital television==
OPB&#x27;s first digital channel was OPB CREATE (an affiliate of the Create network), announced in January 2006; its availability was limited to certain Comcast digital cable customers and on Clear Creek Television in Oregon City.

In December 2008, in anticipation of the original February 18, 2009, deadline for switching to all-digital broadcasting, OPB announced the launch of three digital subchannels: OPB, which would air OPB programming with an &quot;improved picture for viewers with traditional sets&quot;, OPB HD, airing programming in &quot;high definition with the highest-quality picture and sound&quot;, and OPB Plus, which offered &quot;more choices in viewing times and added programs in news, public affairs and lifestyle.&quot;

===Subchannels===
OPB currently offers four digital multiplex channels:
OPB was one of the partners of The Oregon Channel, a public affairs network that began with the 74th Oregon Legislative Assembly in 2007. Programming consisted of Oregon legislative sessions and other public affairs events. The Oregon Channel was discontinued in 2011.

All of OPB&#x27;s digital channels are also available on cable providers Comcast Xfinity, Charter Spectrum and Ziply Fiber (grandfathered TV subscribers), and three other providers serving specific regions and communities in Oregon: Clear Creek (a cooperative serving the Redland area of Oregon City), BendBroadband (serving Central Oregon), and Crestview Cable Communications (serving Madras, Prineville, and La Pine).

On July 6, 2011, OPB combined OPB and OPB SD into one high-definition channel feed on the main channel of its digital stations. OPB Plus moved from the third digital subchannel to the second subchannel and OPB Radio moved from the fourth digital subchannel to the third subchannel. 

On January 26, 2023, OPB ended broadcasting of OPB Plus and replaced it with OPB World.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
During 2009, OPB shut down the analog transmitters of the stations on a staggered basis. The station&#x27;s digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows:
* KOAC-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 7; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 39 to VHF channel 7.
* KOPB-TV shut down its analog, signal, over VHF channel 10; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 27 to VHF channel 10.
* KEPB-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 28; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 29, using virtual channel 28.
* KOAB-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 11, using virtual channel 3.
* KTVR shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 13; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 5 to channel 13.

OPB also began producing a weekly podcast about local politics called &quot;OPB Politics Now&quot;, which is hosted by Geoff Norcross. OPB produced a 2018 podcast hosted by Leah Sottile entitled &quot;Bundyville&quot; that discussed Cliven Bundy and the sovereign citizen movement. The following year they produced the second season of the podcast entitled &quot;Bundyville: The Remnant&quot;, which discussed right wing extremism and anti-government extremism in America more broadly. In 2020, OPB produced a podcast called Timber Wars. The podcast was hosted by Aaron Scott and discussed the 1990s conflicts in the Pacific Northwest between loggers and environmentalists.

<doc id="566264" wikidata="Q477334" url="?curid=566264" title="Edy's Pie">
<text>Edy&#x27;s Pie (formerly known as Eskimo Pie) is an American brand of chocolate-covered vanilla ice cream bar wrapped in foil. It was the first such dessert sold in the United States. It is marketed by Dreyer&#x27;s, a division of Froneri.

In wake of the George Floyd protests, the name was changed to Edy&#x27;s Pie, in recognition of Dreyer&#x27;s co-founder, candy maker Joseph Edy. The former name used the term Eskimo, a term considered offensive by some for American Inuit, Yupik, and Aleut peoples.

==History==
Danish immigrant Christian Kent Nelson, a schoolteacher and candy store owner, claimed to have received the inspiration for the Eskimo Pie in 1920 in Onawa, Iowa, when a boy in his store was unable to decide whether to spend his money on ice cream or a chocolate bar. After experimenting with different ways to adhere melted chocolate to bricks of ice cream, Nelson began selling his invention, under the name I-Scream Bars. In 1921, he filed for a patent, and secured an agreement with local chocolate producer Russell C. Stover to mass-produce them under the new trademarked name &quot;Eskimo Pie&quot; (a name suggested by his wife, Clara Stover), and to create the Eskimo Pie Corporation. After was issued on January 24, 1922, Nelson franchised the product, allowing ice cream manufacturers to produce them under that name. The patent, which applied to any type of frozen confection encased in candy, was invalidated in 1928.

Stover sold his share of the business. He then formed the well-known chocolate manufacturer Russell Stover Candies. Nelson became independently wealthy off the royalties from the sale of Eskimo Pies. In 1922, he was selling one million pies a day.

Nelson then sold his share of the business to the United States Foil Company, which made the Eskimo Pie wrappers. He retired at a young age, but reportedly out of boredom rejoined what was then called Reynolds Metals Company (now part of Alcoa) in 1935, inventing new methods of manufacturing and shipping Eskimo Pies and serving as an executive until his ultimate retirement in 1961.

In 1992, Nelson died at the age of 99. In that same year, Eskimo Pie Corporation was spun off from Reynolds in an initial public offering, as an alternative to an acquisition that Nestlé had proposed in 1991.
The original round-faced child icon for the brand was created by the illustrator Gyo Fujikawa.

CoolBrands International, a Markham, Ontario-based company, acquired Eskimo Pie Corporation in 2000. Originally a yogurt maker, CoolBrands at one point owned or held exclusive long-term licenses for brands including Eskimo Pie, Chipwich, Weight Watchers, Godiva, Tropicana, Betty Crocker, Trix, Yoo-hoo and Welch&#x27;s. The company encountered financial difficulties after losing its Weight Watchers/Smart Ones license in 2004. By 2007, it was selling off core assets and in February 2007 it sold Eskimo Pie and Chipwich to the Dreyer&#x27;s division of Nestlé.

In 2020, Dreyer&#x27;s announced that they would change the former brand name to &quot;Edy’s Pie&quot; in 2021. The Edy&#x27;s name is a nod to candy maker Joseph Edy, one of the founders of Dreyer&#x27;s.

== In France ==
In June 1924, the &quot;Esquimaux-Brick&quot; company was founded in Paris. It quickly expanded its production to other European countries, in particular to Italy and Hungary. The company produced &quot;Esquimaux Bricks&quot; which, as the name says, did not yet have a stick. The rights for Esquimaux brand were registered in France in 1928. The &quot;Esquimaux Ch. Gervais&quot; were marketed the same year by Gervais, a French cheese producer. In 1931, Gervais bought the Société Esquimaux-Brick, which was dissolved. The trademark was filed by Gervais. It was renamed to &quot;Kim&quot; (&quot;Kim Eskimo&quot; or &quot;Kim cone&quot;) during the years 1990–2000, as due to its wide use it was recognized as a generic name.

==In other countries==

In South Australia, the Alaska Ice Cream company licensed the Eskimo Pie name and manufacturing process in 1923.

In the countries of the former Soviet Union as well as in France the word &quot;Eskimo&quot; is used as a generic name, not a trademark, for chocolate-covered ice cream with a wooden stick to handle it.

In the Czech Republic, &quot;Eskymo&quot; is a brand of Eskimo Pie-style ice cream produced (as of 2020) by Unilever under its Algida brand. While the word &quot;Eskymo&quot; can be used as a generic term in some regions of the country, the most common word for a chocolate-covered bar of ice-cream with a stick handle is &quot;Nanuk&quot; (in reference to the 1922 film &quot;Nanook of the North&quot;).

<text>The pervasiveness of words of [[French language|French]] origin that have been borrowed into English is comparable to that of borrowings from Latin. Estimates vary up, but up to 45% of all English words may have a French origin. This suggests that up to 80,000 words should appear in this list. The list, however, only includes words directly borrowed from French, so it includes both and but does not include derivatives with English suffixes such as , , , and . 

Furthermore, the list excludes compound words in which only one of the elements is from French, e.g. , , , , , and , and English-made combinations of words of French origin, e.g. ( + ), ( + ), , , , and . Also excluded are words that come from French but were introduced into English via another language, e.g. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .

English words of French origin should be distinguished from French words and expressions in English.

Although French is mostly derived from Latin, important other word sources are Gaulish and some Germanic languages, especially Old Frankish. Since English is of Germanic origin, words that have entered English from French borrowings of Germanic words might not look especially French. 

Latin accounts for about 60% of English vocabulary either directly or via a Romance language. As both English and French have taken many words from Latin, determining whether a given Latin word came into English via French or not is often difficult.

== Historical context ==

Most of the French vocabulary now appearing in English was imported over the centuries following the Norman Conquest of 1066, when England came under the administration of Norman-speaking peoples. William the Conqueror invaded the British Isles, distributing lands and property to Norman, Breton, Flemish, and French soldiers. As a result, Old French became the language of culture and the administration, evolving into Anglo-Norman French. 

Although most English people kept speaking Old English, this started to change due to increasing numbers of words borrowed from French (and Latin), the languages of the ruling elite. Often this resulted in pairs of words, often pertaining to different language registers: /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /. Walter Scott popularized the idea of the Anglo-Norman nobility eating the meats of the animals that Anglo-Saxon peasants had raised: /, /, /, /. In each case the word of French origin was only used in the kitchen. However, this occurred centuries after the Norman conquest and might owe more to the enduring prestige of French cuisine than to a hypothetical specialization of tasks. 

Words of French origin often refer to more abstract or generalized notions than their Old English equivalents (e.g. /, /, /, /), and are therefore of less frequent use in everyday language. However, this is not true for all English words of French origin. Consider, for example, some of the most common words in English: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . 

After Henry Plantagenet ascended the throne of England, other French dialects gained influence at the expense of Anglo-Norman French, notably the Angevin dialect from whence the House of Plantagenet came, and possibly Poitevin, the tongue of Eleanor of Aquitaine. With the English claim to the throne of France, the influence of the language in use at the French royal court in Paris increased. French cultural influence remained strong in the following centuries, and from the Renaissance onward, most borrowings were from Parisian French, which became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard language of France.

== Notable fields of French influence ==

=== Feudalism ===

Norman rule of England had a lasting impact on British society. Words from Anglo-Norman or Old French include terms related to (, , , , , , ) and other institutions (, , , , , , ), the organisation of religion (, , , , , , , , , , , , , ), the nobility (, , , , , , ), and the art of war (, , , , , , , ). Many of these words related to the feudal system or medieval warfare have a Germanic origin (mainly through Old Frankish) (see also &quot;French words of Germanic origin&quot;).

The Norman origin of the British monarchy is visible in expressions like , , in which the adjective goes after the noun, as in French.

=== Heraldry ===

The vocabulary of heraldry has been heavily influenced by French (, , , , , ), for more details see tinctures, attitudes, and charges of heraldry.

Sometimes used in heraldry, some mythological beasts (, , , , , ) and exotic animals (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ) draw their name from French. This is also true for some animals native to Europe (via Anglo-Norman: , , , , , , , , , , , , , ).

=== Military ===

The vocabulary of warfare and the military includes many words and expressions of French origin (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , /, , , , , , , , , , , , ). This includes military ranks: , , , , , , . Many fencing terms are also from French.

=== Politics and economics ===

The political/economic lexicon includes many words of French origin such as , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .

=== Law ===

The judicial lexicon has been heavily influenced by French (, , , , , ).

=== Diplomacy ===

=== Arts ===

=== Architecture ===

=== Aviation and automobiles ===

France played a pioneering role in the fields of (, , , , , , , , , ) and engineering or design (, , , , , , , , , , ).

=== Cuisine ===

Vegetables and fruits: (, , , , , , , , , , , , ).

=== Colours and Months ===

Other borrowings include the names of colours (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ), and months of the year (, , , , , ).

=== Terms coined by French people ===

Some of the French words that made their way into the English language were coined by French speaking inventors, pioneers or scientists: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .

=== Named after French people ===

Some English words come from the French surnames of famous people, especially in the fields of science (, , , , , , , , , , ), botany and mineralogy (, , , , , ), fashion and other cultural aspects (, , , , , , , , guillotine). Note also and , though these are not originally French words.

=== Proper names ===

The names of some cities in non-francophone areas came into English with French spelling (Louisville, Constance, Ypres, Bruges, Louvain, Turin, Milan, Plaisance, Florence, Rome, Naples, Syracuse, Vienna, Prague, Munich, Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle, Seville, Constantinople).

In North America, the names of some of the Native American peoples and First Nations who the French were in contact with first are from French (Sioux, Saulteaux, Iroquois, Nez Perce, Huron, Cheyenne, Algonquin). Many place names also came into English via French, such as Canada, Arkansas, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Vermont, Baton Rouge, Boise, Chicago, Des Moines, Detroit.

== Main patterns of influence ==

Some Old French words have been reborrowed during the Middle French or Modern French periods, generally with a more restrictive or specialised meaning. Consider for instance these doublets : /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /, /. Note that the word in French has retained the general meaning: e.g. &quot;château&quot; in French means &quot;castle&quot; and &quot;chef&quot; means &quot;chief&quot;. In fact, loanwords from French generally have a more restricted or specialised meaning than in the original language, e.g. (in Fr. &quot;légume&quot; means &quot;vegetable&quot;), (in Fr. &quot;gâteau&quot; means &quot;cake&quot;).

In some cases, English has been more conservative than French with Old French words, at least in the spelling: e.g. (O.Fr. &quot;apostle&quot; / M.Fr. &quot;apôtre&quot;), (O.Fr. &quot;castel&quot; or &quot;chastel&quot; / M.Fr. &quot;château&quot;), (O.Fr. &quot;forest&quot; / M.Fr. &quot;forêt&quot;), (O.Fr. &quot;vaissel&quot; / M.Fr. &quot;vaisseau&quot;). Other Old French words have even disappeared from Modern French, e.g. .

On the other hand, a move to restore classical word roots (Latin or Ancient Greek), occurred in the 16th and 17th centuries; many words from Old French had their spelling re-Latinized. While this did not generally affect their pronunciation (e.g. , , , ), in some cases it did (e.g. , , ). In words of Greek origin, &quot;f&quot; was replaced by the older &quot;ph&quot; digraph. Hence &quot;fantosme&quot; became , &quot;fesan&quot; became . This also occurred in French, though less systematically: Old French &quot;farmacie&quot; became &quot;pharmacie&quot; (&quot;pharmacy&quot;), &quot;fenix&quot; became &quot;phénix&quot; (&quot;phoenix&quot;), but &quot;fantosme&quot; became &quot;fantôme&quot; (&quot;phantom, ghost&quot;) and &quot;fesan&quot; became &quot;faisan&quot; (&quot;pheasant&quot;).

Beside re-Latinization that blurred the French origin of some words (e.g. , ), other spelling changes have included alterations due to folk etymology e.g. , , , , , , , , , , .

The spelling of some words was changed to keep the pronunciation as close to the original as possible (e.g. ). In other cases, the French spelling was kept, leading to a totally different pronunciation than in French (e.g. , ). More recent borrowings from French have kept their original spelling and a more or less close approximation their original pronunciation: (e.g. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ). However, this may change with time, e.g. the initial &quot;h&quot; in &quot;&quot; is not silent anymore, consider also the variant pronunciations of and . Meanwhile, expressions such as , , , and are still recognisably French.

Borrowing is not a one-way process (&quot;See Reborrowing&quot;). Some words of French origin ultimately come from Old English (Anglo-Saxon words): e.g. , , , or Middle English: e.g. . Conversely, some English words of French origin have made their way &quot;back&quot; into Modern French: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .

<text>Sparganophilus, the only genus in the family Sparganophilidae, is a group of long, slender, limicolous (mud-dwelling) earthworms native to North America. The number of species is unknown, most of them are undescribed, throughout the continent and into Central America. One species, &quot;S. tamesis&quot;, has been introduced into the streams of Europe, where it is now widespread; its synonyms are &quot;S. eiseni&quot;, &quot;S. benhami&quot;, &quot;S. guatemalensis&quot;, &quot;S. carnea&quot;, &quot;S. elongatus&quot;, &quot;S. cuenoti&quot; and, newly, &quot;S. langi&quot;.

&quot;Sparganophilus&quot; species are characterised by a simple gut with no gizzard and no typhlosole. They are true earthworms, having a complex vascular system with capillaries and having the male pores far behind the female pores. They were at one time placed in the earthworm family Glossoscolecidae, but at present are considered to constitute their own family.

&quot;Sparganophilus&quot; species are commonly found in mud next to rivers and streams. They feed in the low oxygen mud and organic material, but with their highly vascularized posterior region on or near the surface.

&quot;Sparganophilus&quot; has no accepted common name.

<text>The Ashanti–Akim–Akwapim War, also known as the Ashanti Invasion of the Gold Coast, was the expansion of West African Empire of Ashanti against the alliance of Akyem and Akuapem tribes from 1814 until 1816 for access to the coast. This battle was not a direct war on Akyem states, which were never subdued by any power, but a war to get access to the coasts in which the Akyem along with Akuapem forces allied for. 

In 1814 the Ashanti, under the leadership of Asantehene Osei Bonsu, defeated the outnumbered Akim-Akwapim alliance. 

After attacking the Fante during this period, the Ashanti seized Accra and took over Fante country, turning it into an Ashanti province. 

After the war and with access to the coast the Ashanti followed up their victory by pillaging the coastal Ga people.

<text>&quot;Chopsticks&quot; (original name &quot;The Celebrated Chop Waltz&quot;) is a simple, widely known waltz for the piano. Written in 1877, it is the only published piece by the British composer Euphemia Allan (under the pen name Arthur de Lulli). Allan—whose brother, Mozart Allan, was a music publisher—was sixteen when she composed the piece, with arrangements for solo and duet. The title &quot;Chop Waltz&quot; comes from Allan&#x27;s specification that the melody be played in two-part harmony with both hands held in a vertical orientation, little fingers down and palms facing each other, striking the keys with a chopping motion. The similar &quot;The Coteletten Polka&quot; also was first heard in 1877, with the piano collection &quot;Paraphrases&quot; elaborating on the theme by 1879.

== Tati-tati and &quot;Paraphrases&quot; ==

An equivalent of this rudimentary two-finger piano exercise was known in Russia in duple meter as &quot;tati-tati&quot; or the &quot;Cutlet Polka&quot;. This version alternates the notes between the hands, rather than playing them at the same time in harmony.

In 1877, Alexander Borodin&#x27;s daughter Gania played &quot;The Coteletten Polka&quot;, with four bars of music similar to the beginning of Allan&#x27;s work, though there is no hard evidence of a common source between the two pieces. In 1878–1879, César Cui, Anatoly Lyadov, Borodin, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Nikolai Shcherbachov each wrote variations for piano duet on the theme, published together under the title &quot;Paraphrases&quot;. A supplementary paraphrase by Franz Liszt was later appended to the collection. In Borodin&#x27;s version, the first four bars begin in a similar way to Allan&#x27;s, but are nevertheless distinct. According to Fuld&#x27;s book &quot;World-Famous Music&quot;, no common origins for the &quot;Chop Waltz&quot; and the &quot;Coteletten Polka&quot; have yet been discovered.

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;Chopsticks&quot; was used as the introductory music to Edgar Kennedy&#x27;s series of short comedies made at the RKO Studios, from 1931 until his death in 1948.
* American composer and educator John Sylvanus Thompson published a set of variations on &quot;Chopsticks&quot; in 1941.
* The first three Pooch the Pup cartoons used &quot;Chopsticks&quot; as their opening music.
* In the 1946 William Wyler film &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, composer Hoagy Carmichael performs a duet of &quot;Chopsticks&quot; with Harold Russell, a World War II Navy veteran who lost both of his hands in combat. He played the simple piece (including variations) with Hoagy taking the lower part. Mr. Russell&#x27;s hooks that served as hands seemingly did not deter him from delivering a rendering of the tune, complete with a final glissando up the keyboard.
* While the 1946 Bugs Bunny short cartoon &quot;Rhapsody Rabbit&quot; mostly features Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&quot;, at one point a mouse briefly plays the opening bars of &quot;Chopsticks&quot;.
* Liberace plays a virtuoso &quot;Chopsticks&quot; accompanied by full orchestra early in the 1955 film &quot;Sincerely Yours&quot;.
* The theme music for the television series &quot;My Three Sons&quot; (1960–1972), written by Frank De Vol, was based on &quot;Chopsticks&quot;, though key changes were added and the meter was changed to 4/4.
* In the 1955 Billy Wilder film &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, Tom Ewell played this together with Marilyn Monroe and tried to kiss her, only to fail.
* In the 1955 season 4 episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; &quot;Ethel&#x27;s Home Town&quot;, Fred Mertz (William Frawley) plays Chopsticks.
* In the 1972 &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Etude in Black&quot;, Columbo plays chopsticks as a way to get under the skin of the pompous murderer/conductor Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes).
* &quot;Chopsticks&quot; accompanied the sequence in the 1972 ABC Saturday Superstar Movie &quot;Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter&quot; in which Beetle Bailey&#x27;s comrade Sergeant Snorkel piles a variety of food on top of a secret message he planned to eat, Dagwood sandwich style.
* A simplified version of the tune is featured in the Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band version of the song &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot;, originally by Bruce Springsteen. The Springsteen version did not contain the tune.
* In Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Lisztomania&quot;, the audience of adolescent girls attending the first Franz Liszt concert demand that he play &quot;Chopsticks&quot;, which he intersperses throughout a fantasia played on the piano based on themes from a Richard Wagner opera, which forces a disgusted Wagner to walk out.
* &quot;Chopsticks&quot; is the second song played by Tom Hanks and Robert Loggia in the famous giant piano scene at FAO Schwarz in the 1988 film &quot;Big&quot;.
* In the stage musical adaption of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Chopsticks&quot; can be heard in the song &quot;Lioness&#x27; Hunt&quot;.
* In the episode &quot;Blind Faith&quot; Season 2 Episode 5 of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; first aired November 1, 1989 Scott Bakula leaps into a blind piano player on stage just in time for the encore performance. Bakula plays &quot;Chopsticks&quot; amusing the large audience in the music hall.
* The character Ryan Sinclair plays chopsticks in &quot;The Haunting of Villa Diodati&quot;, an episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; anachronistically set in 1816.
* The melody is quoted in Hoyt Curtin&#x27;s theme to the 1960s Hanna-Barbera animated sitcom &quot;The Jetsons&quot;.
* The melody is the basis of J-pop group NiziU&#x27;s 2021 single &quot;Chopstick&quot;.
* Singer-songwriter Liz Phair opens the song “Chopsticks”, from her 1994 album &quot;Whip-Smart&quot;, with a variation of the waltz played on piano in 4/4 time, and the theme continues through the song.
* The tune was played in the &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; episode &quot;Breaking Up And Making Up&quot;.
* The melody is played by Sean Penn in the 1984 film &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot; while he is teaching Elizabeth McGovern the piano in an old honky-tonk bar.
* In Brazil the melody is known as &quot;O Bife&quot; (The Beef). An adaptation as a song has been used since the 80s by Danone for commercials for their children&#x27;s petit suisse brand &quot;Danoninho&quot; even releasing an LP in 1989 under the name &quot;O Bifinho&quot;.

<text>Polly Celine Eveline Matzinger (born July 21, 1947) is a French-born immunologist who proposed the danger model theory of how the immune system works.

==Early years==
Polly Matzinger was born on July 21, 1947, in France to a French mother (Simone) and a Dutch father (Hans). In 1954, she immigrated to the U.S. with her sister, Marjolaine, and parents. Her prior jobs included being a bass jazz musician, carpenter, dog trainer, waitress, and Playboy Bunny. She finished her bachelor&#x27;s of science in biology at the University of California, Irvine in 1976, and doctorate in biology at the University of California, San Diego in 1979. She then did four years of postdoctoral work at the University of Cambridge and was a scientist at the Basel Institute for Immunology for six years before working at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Ghost Lab at NIAID==
Matzinger is chief of the T-Cell Tolerance and Memory Section at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The lab has been referred to as the &quot;Ghost Lab&quot; for Matzinger&#x27;s choice to conduct the first nine months of her research alone with a focus on chaos theory. In 2013, while reorganizing the Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, NIAID transferred Matzinger&#x27;s section to the Laboratory of Immunogenetics.

In 2015, Matzinger recorded an eight-part series on the danger model of the immune system, covering transplant rejection, tumors, autoimmunity, T cells, parasites, and alarmins.

== Research ==
===The danger model===
The Self/Non-self Model proposed by Macfarlane Burnet and Frank Fenner in 1949 faced challenges in the late 1980s as immunologists recognized that T cells depend on antigen-presenting cells showcasing materials and sending co-stimulatory signals. Driven by the writings of Thomas Kuhn on paradigm shifts in science, Charles Janeway made a 1989 proposal that the innate immune system was the real gatekeeper of immune system responses. He also theorized that the innate immune system used ancient pattern-recognition receptors to make these decisions, recognizing a pathogen by its unchanging characteristics.

====Danger signals====
In her 1994 article &quot;Tolerance, Danger, and the Extended Family&quot;, Matzinger extended the danger model, arguing that antigen-presenting cells respond to &quot;danger signals&quot; released from cells undergoing unprogrammed cell death when injured or stressed, as opposed to apoptosis (controlled cell death). The alarm signals released by these cells let the immune system know that there is a problem requiring an immune response. She argued that T cells and the immune response they orchestrate occur not because of a neonatal definition of &quot;self&quot;, as in the previous model, nor because of ancient definitions of pathogens, as in Janeway&#x27;s argument, but because of a dynamic and constantly updated response to danger as defined by cellular damage.

====Scope====
The danger model is broad, covering topics as diverse as transplantation, maternal/fetal immunity, autoimmunity, cancer treatments, and vaccines. Matzinger argued that prior models failed to explain why immune system responses vary based on the specific threat&#x27;s location and severity. Prior models also fail to explain how the immune system rejects tumors, induces autoimmune diseases, or generates allergic responses.

Some immunologists still maintain Janeway&#x27;s ideas, believing that the immune response is mainly fueled by innate evolutionarily conserved &quot;pattern recognition receptors&quot; that recognize similarities between microorganisms, minimizing the effects of unprogrammed cell death.

===Pattern recognition and a tissue-driven immune system===
Seung-Yong Seong and Matzinger have proposed exposed hydrophobic regions on biological compounds as among the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of the danger model. Facing stressors, cells misfold and denature their proteins, exposing hydrophobic regions that aggregate into clumps to avoid exposure to the water-filled environment.

In a 2013 article in &quot;Nature Immunology&quot;, Matzinger highlighted the danger model&#x27;s primary implication that bodily tissues drive immune responses. As research continues to show the bacteria of each organ&#x27;s microbiome guiding its function and outputs, Matzinger theorizes that microbes may be shown as driving immune system responses. Matzinger argues that DAMPs may explain why toll-like receptors respond to both external and endogenous ligand signals with her danger model suggesting a multitude of signalling pathways determining the extent and nature of each immune system response.

===Challenges to Matzinger&#x27;s theories===
Regulatory T cells have been shown suppressing immune responses, exemplified by the autoimmune IPEX syndrome occurring when the master regulator of these Treg cells is dysfunctional. Matzinger has incorporated Treg cells into her danger model, arguing that their regulation activity is not absolute, based on transplant organs being rejected at higher rates if infected, showing that danger signals continue to dictate the immune response.

Criticisms of the danger model focus on two key points: First, Matzinger argued that tumors persist to cause cancer because their cells undergo programmed cell death, failing to release danger signals for an immune response. However, recent research has shown the immune system detecting and destroying some tumors. Second, the danger model explains transplant rejection as the result of surgery-induced damage, but this explanation fails to account for greater tolerance of autotransplantation, the movement of tissue between parts of the same body.

Terms coined by Matzinger, such as &quot;professional antigen-presenting-cell&quot;, &quot;danger signal&quot;, and &quot;DAMPs&quot;, are frequently repurposed for explanations of the self/non-self model of the immune system. The immunologist Russell E. Vance has argued that immunological paradigms like the danger model are inevitably inaccurate representations of distinct mechanisms generated under evolutionary pressure.

===Dog co-author controversy===
In 1978, Matzinger published her fourth paper in the &quot;Journal of Experimental Medicine&quot;, listing her Afghan Hound, Galadriel Mirkwood, as a coauthor to write in a third-person active voice. Upon identifying this, she was banned from publishing in the journal.

== Awards ==
At the 1986 Köln Film Festival, Polly Matzinger won the Award for Special Excellence in Educational Films for the German translation of &quot;Immunity: The Inside Story&quot;. In 1996, she was inducted as an honorary lifetime member of the Scandinavian Society of Immunology. In 2002, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine recognized Matzinger as one of the fifty most important women in science. In 2003, she received an honorary doctorate from Hasselt University. In 2008, she was listed as a &quot;Highly Cited&quot; research among the top 1% of citations for her field on the Web of Science.

Since 2009, the biotechnology company EpiVax has funded the Polly Matzinger Fearless Scientist Scholarship for women scientists at the University of Rhode Island&#x27;s Institute for Immunology &amp; Informatics that overcome challenges.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1945:

== Events ==
* The probe-and-drogue aerial refueling system, in which the tanker aircraft trails a hose with a stabilizing conical drogue at its end which mates to a fixed probe mounted on the receiving aircraft, is perfected. It is superior to and replaces the looped-hose system which had been in use since 1934, and it remains in use today.
* With its runways repaired Leningrad′s Shosseynaya Airport (the future Pulkovo Airport) reopens; it had been closed since 1941 because of the proximity of German forces during the Siege of Leningrad. Only cargo and mail flights will take place until February 1948, when scheduled passenger service finally will resume.
* Iraqi Airways is founded. It will begin flight operations in January 1946.

===January===
* January 1 – The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; targets Allied airfields in Europe in &quot;Operation Bodenplatte&quot;, occurring during the German withdrawal from the Battle of the Bulge.
* January 2
** Japanese aircraft attack United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress bases on Saipan for the last time.
** U.S. Army Air Forces Twentieth Air Force B-29s based at Calcutta, India, bomb Bangkok, Siam.
**Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay dies in the crash just after takeoff of a Lockheed Hudson at Toussus-le-Noble, France.
* January 3 – The United States Navy creates its first aircraft carrier task group devoted to night flying, Task Group 38.5, consisting of the carriers and and six destroyers.
* January 3–4 – U.S. Navy Task Force 38 begins its support of the U.S. invasion of Lingayen Gulf with carrier air strikes against Japanese forces and facilities on Formosa, the Pescadores, the Sakishima Gunto, and Okinawa, with the loss of 22 U.S. aircraft. Bad weather curtails the strikes and makes bomb damage assessment impossible, although the task force believes it has destroyed about 100 Japanese aircraft.
* January 4
** A single Japanese bomber destroys 11 U.S. Navy PV-1 Ventura patrol aircraft parked at Tacloban Airfield on Leyte.
** The escort carrier is fatally damaged by a Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; in the Sulu Sea and scuttled later in the day.
** The Japanese make their last &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on the U.S. invasion force off Mindoro, causing a cargo ship carrying ammunition to explode, killing all 71 merchant mariners on board.
* January 5 – &quot;Kamikazes&quot; damage the U.S. escort carrier and heavy cruiser and the Australian heavy cruiser in the South China Sea west of Manila Bay.
* January 6
** Twentieth Air Force B-29s raid the Ōmura aircraft factory on Kyushu.
** Task Force 38 carrier aircraft attack Japanese forces and facilities on Luzon, claiming 14 Japanese aircraft destroyed in the air and 18 on the ground in exchange for the loss of 17 U.S. aircraft, but bad weather prevents them from employing the &quot;Big Blue Blanket&quot; tactic of maintaining continuous coverage over Japanese airfields to prevent Japanese aircraft from attacking the U.S. invasion force in Lingayen Gulf. In Lingayen Gulf, &quot;kamikazes&quot; damage the battleship , killing 30 – including British Lieutenant General Herbert Lumsden – the battleship , the heavy cruiser – mortally wounding Rear Admiral Theodore E. Chandler – the heavy cruiser HMAS &quot;Australia&quot;, the light cruiser , three destroyers, a destroyer-minesweeper, and a destroyer-transport and sink a destroyer-minesweeper.
* January 7
** In clearer weather, Task Force 38 aircraft employ the &quot;Big Blue Blanket&quot; tactic over Luzon, flying 757 sorties, shooting down all four Japanese aircraft that they meet in the air and claiming another 75 destroyed on the ground. Task Force 38 loses 10 planes in combat and 18 due to non-combat causes. Eleven U.S. escort carriers in Lingayen Gulf contribute another 143 sorties, and U.S. Army Air Forces planes also participate. In Lingayen Gulf, &quot;kamikazes&quot; sink a destroyer and a destroyer-minesweeper.
** The second-highest-scoring American ace of World War II, U.S. Army Air Forces Major Thomas McGuire, is killed when his P-38 Lightning stalls at low altitude and crashes during a dogfight with a Japanese Nakajima Ki-43 (Allied reporting name &quot;Oscar&quot;) fighter near Manapla over Negros Island in the Philippines. He has 38 kills at the time of his death.
* January 8
** A &quot;kamikaze&quot; again damages the heavy cruiser HMAS &quot;Australia&quot; in Lingayen Gulf. Out in the South China Sea, &quot;kamikazes&quot; damage the escort carriers and and an attack transport.
** The Pan American World Airways Martin M-130 flying boat &quot;China Clipper&quot;, operating as Flight 161, strikes a blacked-out boat and crashes while landing at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, killing between 23 and 25 of the 30 people on board.
* January 9
** U.S. forces invade Luzon, landing at Lingayen Gulf. During the day, &quot;kamikazes&quot; attacking ships in the gulf damage the battleship and the light cruiser .
** Task Force 38 carrier aircraft strike Japanese targets at Formosa and Miyako-jima in foul weather, flying 717 sorties and dropping 212 tons (192,325 kg) of bombs. They shoot down all four Japanese aircraft they encounter in the air and claim 42 more on the ground, in exchange for the loss of 10 U.S. aircraft. They also sink a number of merchant ships and small naval craft. It is the last of seven days of Task Force 38 support to the Lingayen landings, during which it has flown 3,030 combat sorties, dropped 9,110 bombs – totaling about 700 tons (635,036 kg) of bombs – and lost 46 planes in combat and 40 to non-combat causes.
** B-29s based at Kunming, China, attack Japanese shipping along the coast of Formosa, while Mariana Islands-based B-29s drop 122 tons (110,678 kg) of bombs on Japan.
* January 11 – U.S. Army Air Forces Twentieth Air Force B-29s based at Calcutta bomb Singapore.
* January 12 – With 850 aircraft aboard its carriers, Task Force 38 strikes targets along a 420-nautical mile (778-km) stretch of the coast of French Indochina, flying 1,465 sorties; sinking 12 tankers, 17 other merchant ships, the disarmed French cruiser , and 15 Japanese naval vessels, including the light cruiser ; and destroying 15 Japanese aircraft in the air, 77 on the ground, and 20 floatplanes on Camranh Bay in exchange for the loss of 23 U.S. aircraft.
* January 12–13 – &quot;Kamikazes&quot; resume attacks in Lingayen Gulf, damaging a destroyer escort, a destroyer-transport, an attack transport, and several merchant ships.
* January 13 – A &quot;kamikaze&quot; damages the escort carrier in the South China Sea off the mouth of Lingayen Gulf. It is the last successful &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack in the waters of the Philippine Islands.
* January 14 – U.S. Army Air Forces Twentieth Air Force B-29s bomb Formosa.
* January 15
**Task Force 38 carrier aircraft in bad weather strike Japanese forces in China, Formosa, and the Pescadores, sinking two destroyers, a transport, and a tanker and destroying 16 Japanese aircraft in the air and 18 on the ground in exchange for the loss of 12 U.S. aircraft.
**The German submarine torpedoes the British escort aircraft carrier in the Irish Sea near the Clyde Lightvessel. &quot;Thane&quot; never again is seaworthy.
* January 16
** Task Force 38 aircraft strike Hong Kong, Hainan, and Canton and sweep the coast of China from the Liuchow Peninsula to Swatow. Hampered by bad weather, they sink two merchant ships and damage four others and destroy 13 Japanese planes in exchange for the loss of 22 U.S. aircraft in combat and five to non-combat causes.
** U.S. Navy escort carrier support to the Lingayen Gulf landings ends. During 12 days of support, their aircraft have flown 6,152 sorties and claimed 92 Japanese aircraft destroyed in exchange for the loss of two aircraft, both FM Wildcat fighters.
** The new British Pacific Fleet departs Ceylon for Australia.
* January 16–20 – The U.S. Army Air Forces Fourteenth Air Force destroys over 100 Japanese planes on the ground in and around Shanghai, China.
* January 17 – Twentieth Air Force B-29s bomb Formosa.
* January 21
** Task Force 38 aircraft fly 1,164 sorties in strikes on Formosa, the Pescadores, and the Sakishima Gunto, sinking five tankers and five other merchant ships and destroying two Japanese aircraft in the air and 104 on the ground. In Japanese air attacks on the task force, a bomber damages the aircraft carrier and &quot;kamikazes&quot; damage the carrier and a destroyer; an accidental bomb explosion during a landing accident damages the carrier .
**The British East Indies Fleet aircraft carriers and support the landings of the 26th Indian Infantry Division on Ramree Island off the coast of Burma.
* January 22
** Task Force 38 aircraft conduct an early morning night strike against Formosa, sinking a large tanker in exchange for the loss of three U.S. aircraft, then fly 682 sorties during daylight hours to strike and conduct photographic reconnaissance missions against Okinawa, the Sakishima Gunto, Ie Shima, and Amami O Shima, destroying 28 Japanese aircraft, all on the ground. Task Force 38 then retires to its base at Ulithi Atoll. During January 1945, its aircraft have destroyed 300,000 tons of Japanese shipping and claimed 615 Japanese planes destroyed in exchange for the loss of 201 U.S. carrier aircraft.
** U.S. Army Air Forces aircraft begin a heavy bombing campaign against Japanese forces on Corregidor. By the time U.S. ground forces land on Corregidor on February 15–16, they will drop over 3,200 tons (2,903,021 kg) of bombs on the island.

Japanese aircraft counterattack the British carriers, but the British combat air patrol shoots them all down. In the strikes on January 24 and 29 combined, the British Pacific Fleet has lost 16 aircraft to enemy action and others in accidents, as well as 30 aircrewmen, some without trace.
**The Germans scuttle the incomplete aircraft carrier – the proposed name &quot;Weser&quot; for her had never been officially assigned – at Königsberg to prevent her capture by the Soviet Union.
* January 31
** Part of the left wing of the Australian National Airways Stinson Model A &quot;Tokana&quot; (registration VH-UYY) separates from the aircraft at an altitude of about as it flies near Redesdale, Victoria, Australia. The airliner crashes, killing all 10 people on board.
