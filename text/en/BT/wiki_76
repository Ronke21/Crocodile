<text>The Mitsubishi G4M is a twin-engine, land-based medium bomber formerly manufactured by the Mitsubishi Aircraft Company, a part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy from 1940 to 1945. Its official designation is and was commonly referred to by Japanese Navy pilots as due to the cylindrical shape of its fuselage and its tendency to ignite after a hit. The Allied reporting name was &quot;Betty&quot;.

Designed to a strict specification to succeed the Mitsubishi G3M already in service, the G4M boasted very good performance and excellent range and was considered the best land-based naval bomber at the time. This was achieved by its structural lightness and an almost total lack of protection for the crew, with no armor plating or self-sealing fuel tanks. The G4M was officially adopted on 2 April 1941, but the aforementioned problems would prove to be a severe drawback, often resulting in heavy losses; Allied fighter pilots nicknamed the G4M &quot;The Flying Lighter&quot;, as it was extremely prone to ignition after a few hits. It was not until later variants of the G4M2 and G4M3 that self-sealing fuel tanks, armor protection for the crew and better defensive armament was installed.

Nevertheless, the G4M would become the Japanese Navy&#x27;s primary land-based bomber. It is the most widely produced and most famous bomber operated by the Japanese during World War II and it served in nearly all battles during the Pacific War. Attacks by G4M and G3M bombers resulted in the sinking of the Royal Navy battleship and battlecruiser , the first time capital ships actively defending themselves were sunk solely by air power while in the open sea. G4Ms and G3Ms are also credited with sinking the heavy cruiser USS &quot;Chicago&quot; during the Battle of Rennell Island. The aircraft later served as the mother ship that carried the Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka, a purpose-built anti-ship suicide weapon during the final years of the war. Of the 2,435 G4Ms produced, no fully intact aircraft have survived, though several airframes exist as unrestored wreckage or in partial states of completion.

==Design and development==

The G4M&#x27;s predecessor, the Mitsubishi G3M, went into service in 1937 in China. Only two months later the Japanese Navy issued specifications to Mitsubishi. The specifications, unprecedented at the time, called for a twin-engine, land-based, attack bomber with a top speed of , a cruising altitude of , and a range of unloaded (without bombs and torpedoes), and a range of when carrying an torpedo or the same weight in bombs.
The G4M was designed for a long range and high speed at the time of its introduction. In order to meet the Navy&#x27;s specifications a Mitsubishi team led by Kiro Honjo did not incorporate self-sealing fuel tanks and armor plating to save weight and extend range. This consequently made both the G4M and the Zero, in which Mitsubishi used the same design features, vulnerable to machine gun and cannon fire. Consequently, this led to Allied fighter pilots giving it derisive nicknames such as &quot;the flying lighter&quot; &quot;the one-shot lighter&quot;, &quot;the flying Zippo&quot; and &quot;the flying cigar&quot; because of its tendency to ignite from damage to the wing fuel tanks after being hit by gunfire. The pilots of the Imperial Japanese Navy called the G4M the &quot;hamaki&quot; (&quot;cigar&quot;), although this was due to its shape. Due to deficiencies of the G3M in warding off concentrated fighter attacks Honjo incorporated guns in the nose, on top and both sides of the fuselage and in the tail a cannon was added.

When used for medium- to high-altitude bombing against stationary land targets like supply depots, seaports or airfields, it was much harder to intercept. Using its long range and high speed, the G4M could appear from any direction, and leave before any fighters intercepted it. The 20 mm cannon in its tail turret was much heavier armament than was commonly carried by bombers of either side, making aerial attacks from the rear quite dangerous for the Allied fighter aircraft. If G4Ms did not catch fire after being hit in the wings by flak from the ground or by machine gun bullets from enemy fighters, they could remain airborne despite severe damage. For example, after the attack of the &quot;751 Kōkūtai&quot; (air group) on the USS &quot;Chicago&quot; during the Battle of Rennell Island, three out of four surviving aircraft (of the original eleven) returned despite flying with only one engine.

As the war continued improved bomber designs failed to materialize and Mitsubishi began creating additional versions to fulfill various new missions as well as eliminate the weakness in the design including various engine and weapon variants. The G4M2 redesign failed to rectify the G4M&#x27;s vulnerability to weapons fire.

===First flight===
The first G4M prototype left Mitsubishi&#x27;s Nagoya plant in September 1939 disassembled and loaded in five ox-drawn farm carts to Kagamigahara airfield to the north. On 23 October 1939, test pilot Katsuzo Shima flew the G4M prototype. Despite successful tests, the Navy shelved the bomber for the more heavily armed G6M1 variant in hopes it could be used as heavy escort fighter for other bombers. Failing these expectations, the G4M1 was ordered into production.

===Production===
The first production G4M was completed in April 1941 and was not discontinued until the end of the war.

* G4M1 Model 11: 1172 examples (including prototypes)
* G4M2 models 22, 22 &quot;Ko&quot; and 22 &quot;Otsu&quot;: 429 examples
* G4M2a, models 24, 24 &quot;Ko&quot;, 24 &quot;Otsu&quot;, 24 &quot;Hei&quot;, and 24 &quot;Tei&quot;: 713 examples
* G4M3 models 34 &quot;Ko&quot;, 34 &quot;Otsu&quot;, and 34 &quot;Hei&quot;: 91 examples
* G6M1: 30 examples
* Total production of all versions: 2,435 examples

==Operational history==
The G4M was similar in performance and missions to other contemporary twin-engine bombers such as the German Heinkel He 111 and the American North American B-25 Mitchell. These were all commonly used in anti-ship roles. The G4M Model &quot;11&quot; was prominent in attacks on Allied shipping from 1941 to early 1944, but after that it became increasingly easy prey for Allied fighters.

The G4M was first used in combat on 13 September 1940 in Mainland China, when 27 &quot;Bettys&quot; and Mitsubishi C5Ms of 1st &quot;Rengo Kōkūtai&quot; (a mixed force including elements of the &quot;Kanoya&quot; and &quot;Kizarazu&quot; &quot;Kōkūtai&quot;) departed from Taipei, Omura, and Jeju City to attack Hankow. The bombers and the reconnaissance aircraft were escorted by 13 A6M Zeros of 12th &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; led by the IJN lieutenant, Saburo Shindo. A similar operation occurred in May 1941. In December 1941, 107 G4Ms based on Formosa of 1st &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; and &quot;Kanoya Kōkūtai&quot; belonging to the 21st &quot;Koku Sentai&quot; (air flotilla) crossed the Luzon Strait en route to bombing the Philippines; this was the beginning of Japanese invasions in the Southwest Pacific Theater.
In its first year of combat the G4M was a success. They bombed the U.S. Army air base Clark Field, Philippines on 8 December 1941. The G4M was instrumental in sinking HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; two days later. Nine G4Ms participated in the long-range bombing raid of Katherine, Northern Territory, on 22 March 1942 (the deepest inland attack on Australian territory during the war at over 200 miles from the coast). Against weak fighter opposition the G4M attacked targets ranging as far as the Aleutians to Australia using its long range, the drawbacks of no self-sealing fuel tanks and armor not presenting themselves as problems at this point.

The G4M&#x27;s most notable use as a torpedo bomber was in the sinking of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; off the eastern coast of Malaya on 10 December 1941. The G4Ms attacked along with older Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot; bombers, which made high-level bombing runs. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were the first two capital ships to be sunk exclusively by air attacks during a war, while in open waters. The bomber crews were from the Kanoya Air Group (later 751 Ku), Genzan Air Group (later 753 Ku), and the Mihoro Air Group (later 701 Ku), trained in torpedo attacks at an altitude of less than , and in long-range over-ocean navigation, so they could attack naval targets moving quickly at sea.

G4Ms later made many attacks against Allied ships and also land targets during the six-month-long Guadalcanal Campaign (in the Solomon Islands) in late 1942. More than 100 G4M1s and their pilots and crews were lost (with no replacements or substitutes available) during the many battles over and near Guadalcanal from August to October 1942. On 8 August 1942, during the second day of the U.S. Marine landings on Guadalcanal, 23 IJNAF torpedo-carrying G4M1s attacked American ships at Lunga Point, but the American ships were well-defended by carrier-based F4F fighters and very heavy anti-aircraft fire. 18 of the G4M1s were shot down while all 18 Japanese crews – approximately 120 aviators – were lost at Lunga Point. In the two days of the Battle of Rennell Island, 29 and 30 January 1943, 10 out of 43 G4M1s were shot down during night torpedo attacks, all by U.S. Navy anti-aircraft fire. About 70 Japanese aviators, including Lieutenant Commander Higai, were killed during that battle.
Probably the best-known incident involving a G4M in the war came during the top secret mission to intercept the aircraft carrying Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, resulting in Yamamoto&#x27;s death. On 18 April 1943, sixteen P-38 Lightnings of the 339th Fighter Squadron of the 347th Fighter Group, Thirteenth Air Force, shot down a G4M1 of the 705th &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; with the tailcode &quot;T1-323&quot;, carrying Admiral Yamamoto. In the same battle, another G4M1 carrying Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki was also downed by the P-38s, although Ugaki survived.
The G4M Model &quot;11&quot; was replaced by the Models &quot;22&quot;, &quot;22a/b&quot;, &quot;24a/b&quot;, &quot;25&quot;, &quot;26&quot;, and &quot;27&quot; from June 1943 onward, giving service in New Guinea, the Solomons, and the South Pacific area, in defense of the Marianas and finally in Okinawa. Other G4Ms received field modifications, resulting in the Model &quot;24j&quot;. This model carried the Yokosuka MXY7 &quot;Ohka&quot; Model &quot;11&quot; suicide flying bomb, beginning on 21 March 1945, with disastrous results due to heavy Allied fighter opposition.

After the loss of Okinawa, G4Ms constituted the main weapon of the land-based Japanese naval bomber force. It consisted of twenty &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; at the end of the war. This included the testing air group, which was equipped in 1944–45 with the latest version G4M3 Models &quot;34&quot; and &quot;36&quot; - though these arrived too late to affect the course of the war.

From November 1944 to January 1945, G4Ms were one of the main types of aircraft used in the Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands and plans to use converted G4Ms to land commandos on the islands were developed in mid-1945 and cancelled only at the end of the war.

As part of the negotiations for the surrender of Japan, two demilitarized G4Ms, given the call-signs Bataan 1 and Bataan 2, flew to Ie Shima, carrying the first surrender delegations on the first leg of their flight to Manila. The G4Ms were painted white with green crosses and were escorted by American P-38 fighters.

The G4M&#x27;s intended successor was the Yokosuka P1Y Ginga. However, because of production problems, the changeover was only begun by the time the war ended.

==Variants==

===G4M1===
;G4M1 prototypes: (Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 attack bomber) / (Mitsubishi Navy Experimental 12-Shi land attacker). Two prototypes built.
;G4M1 Model 11: (Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 Attack Bomber Model 11). The first bomber model of series, with Mitsubishi MK4A &quot;Kasei&quot; Model 11 engines driving three-blade propellers. The following modifications were made during production:
* March 1942: the first aircraft (241st production example) fitted with Mitsubishi MK4E &quot;Kasei&quot; Model 15 engines with larger superchargers for better high altitude performance, became standard in August 1942 from 406th aircraft onwards. These MK4E-engined aircraft have often (erroneously) been referred as the &quot;G4M1 Model 12&quot;.
* Summer 1942: propeller spinners introduced
* March 1943: from 663rd machine onwards, rubber ply sheets installed beneath the wing outer surfaces to protect the underside of the fuel tanks (speed reduced by and range by , armour plates added into tail gunner&#x27;s compartment.
* Spring 1943: outer half of the tail cone cut away in order to improve tail gunner&#x27;s field of fire.
* August 1943: a completely redesigned tail cone, with reduced framing and wide V-shaped cut out; this form of tail cone was also used in all G4M2 models.
* September 1943: individual exhaust stacks from 954th airframe onwards

Production of the G4M1 ended in January 1944.

===G4M2===

The first of the four G4M2 prototypes flew in December 1942 (Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 Attack Bomber Model 22). It differed from the preceding model in having Mitsubishi MK4P &quot;Kasei&quot; Model 21 engines with VDM electric four-blade propellers capable of full feathering function, redesigned main wings with LB type laminar flow airfoil. and widened tail horizontal stabilizer wing area, which improved service ceiling to and maximum speed to . Main wing fuel tanks were enlarged to which increased the range to (overloaded, one way). An electrically powered dorsal turret featuring a Type 99 cannon was introduced in place of G4M1&#x27;s dorsal position with a Type 92 machine gun, total guns armed were two Type 99 cannons (one tail turret, one top turret), and four Type 92 machine guns (one nose, two waist, and one cockpit side). External differences also included increased nose glazing, flush side gun positions instead of blisters, and rounded tips of wings and tail surfaces. These major improvements also made it possible for the G4M2 to carry more powerful bombs; one Navy Type 91 Kai-7 aerial torpedo or one bomb or two bombs or one Type 3 No. 31 bomb (ray-detective type bomb) and twelve bombs. The G4M2 entered service in mid-1943.

;G4M2 Model 22: (Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 Attack Bomber Model 22) the base model, the first production example completed in July 1943. Introduced bulged bomb bay doors from 65th aircraft onwards, and an optically flat panel in the nose cone from the 105th aircraft onwards.
;G4M2 Model 22&quot;Ko&quot;: (Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 Attack Bomber Model 22 &quot;Ko&quot;) very similar to previous model. Carried Type 3 &quot;Ku&quot; Mark 6 search radar and was armed with Type 99 Model 1 cannon s replacing the Type 92 machine guns in the lateral positions.

* United States Army Air Force operated captured aircraft for evaluation.

==Surviving aircraft==
No complete or flyable Mitsubishi G4Ms are left, although several wrecks remain scattered in southeast Asia and on Pacific islands, having been left in-situ following the end of the war. In addition, several G4Ms survive in the form of preserved fuselage sections.
*G4M1 Model 11 (Serial #1280): On display in a diorama at the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California in an unrestored condition. The only complete G4M Betty bomber. Built in Nagoya Works No. 3 on 16 April 1942, tail number &quot;370&quot;, which had probably crash landed before mid-1944, and was recovered from Babo Airfield, Indonesia, in 1991.
*G4M1 Model 11 (Serial #1800): Assigned to the 701st Naval Air Group. Abandoned on Ballale Airfield. During August 2018, it was recovered from Ballale Island in the Solomon Islands, along with another G4M1 (Serial #2806) and the fuselage of an early model G4M1 by a &quot;foreign salvager.&quot;
*G4M1 Model 11 (Serial #2806): Tail code &quot;U-321&quot;, was assigned to the Misawa Naval Air Group in the Solomon Islands from Ballale Airfield. Was abandoned on a revetment, next to a bomb crater, both engines missing. During August 2018 it was recovered by a &quot;foreign salvager&quot; along with another G4M1 Betty Model 11 (Serial #1800) and a fuselage of an early model G4M1. Since late January 2021 was on display at Markwarth Collection / Solomon Islands War Museum (SIWM) with a tail section attached, possibly with that of the early model G4M1.

Several other locations display pieces of G4Ms including the restored fuselage of a G4M2 is on display at the Kawaguchiko Motor Museum in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan.

Additionally the Smithsonian Institution retains the forward fuselage of a G4M3 Betty Model 34. Likely based in Oppama Air Field near Yokosuka, Japan there is no recorded tail number. The aircraft was part of 145 other Japanese aircraft for tests and evaluations by the U.S. Navy. After being flight tested as &quot;Foreign Equipment Test number T2-2205&quot; the airplane was dismembered by a cutting torch for unknown reasons.

The wreck of Admiral Yamamoto&#x27;s G4M1 Model 11 (Serial #2656) tail code &quot;323&quot; were still present at the crash site in the jungle near Panguna, Bougainville Island, with some parts and artifacts recovered and displayed at the museums in Papua New Guinea, Australia, and Japan. The wreck consisted of rear fuselage section and vertical stabilizer along with parts of the wings and engines. The crash site is accessible via prior arrangement to the landowners.

<text>In mathematics, for a function formula_1, the image of an input value formula_2 is the single output value produced by formula_3 when passed formula_2. The preimage of an output value formula_5 is the set of input values that produce formula_5.

More generally, evaluating formula_3 at each element of a given subset formula_8 of its domain formula_9 produces a set, called the &quot;image of formula_8 under (or through) formula_3&quot;. Similarly, the inverse image (or preimage) of a given subset formula_12 of the codomain formula_13 is the set of all elements of formula_9 that map to a member of formula_15

The image of the function formula_3 is the set of all output values it may produce, that is, the image of formula_9. The preimage of formula_3, that is, the preimage of formula_13 under formula_3, always equals formula_9 (the domain of formula_3); therefore, the former notion is rarely used.

Image and inverse image may also be defined for general binary relations, not just functions.

==Definition==


The word &quot;image&quot; is used in three related ways. In these definitions, formula_23 is a function from the set formula_9 to the set formula_25

===Image of an element===

If formula_2 is a member of formula_27 then the image of formula_2 under formula_29 denoted formula_30 is the value of formula_3 when applied to formula_32 formula_33 is alternatively known as the output of formula_3 for argument formula_32 

Given formula_36 the function formula_3 is said to or if there exists some formula_2 in the function&#x27;s domain such that formula_39 
Similarly, given a set formula_40 formula_3 is said to if there exists formula_2 in the function&#x27;s domain such that formula_43 
However, and means that formula_44 for point formula_2 in the domain of formula_3 .

===Image of a subset===

Throughout, let formula_23 be a function. 
The under formula_3 of a subset formula_8 of formula_9 is the set of all formula_51 for formula_52 It is denoted by formula_53 or by formula_54 when there is no risk of confusion. Using set-builder notation, this definition can be written as
formula_55

This induces a function formula_56 where formula_57 denotes the power set of a set formula_58 that is the set of all subsets of formula_59 See below for more.

===Image of a function===

The &quot;image&quot; of a function is the image of its entire domain, also known as the range of the function. This last usage should be avoided because the word &quot;range&quot; is also commonly used to mean the codomain of formula_60

===Generalization to binary relations===

If formula_61 is an arbitrary binary relation on formula_62 then the set formula_63 is called the image, or the range, of formula_64 Dually, the set formula_65 is called the domain of formula_64

==Inverse image==
Let formula_3 be a function from formula_9 to formula_25 The preimage or inverse image of a set formula_70 under formula_29 denoted by formula_72 is the subset of formula_9 defined by
formula_74

Other notations include formula_75 and formula_76 
The inverse image of a singleton set, denoted by formula_77 or by formula_78 is also called the fiber or fiber over formula_5 or the level set of formula_80 The set of all the fibers over the elements of formula_13 is a family of sets indexed by formula_25

For example, for the function formula_83 the inverse image of formula_84 would be formula_85 Again, if there is no risk of confusion, formula_86 can be denoted by formula_87 and formula_88 can also be thought of as a function from the power set of formula_13 to the power set of formula_90 The notation formula_88 should not be confused with that for inverse function, although it coincides with the usual one for bijections in that the inverse image of formula_12 under formula_3 is the image of formula_12 under formula_95

==Notation for image and inverse image==
The traditional notations used in the previous section do not distinguish the original function formula_23 from the image-of-sets function formula_97; likewise they do not distinguish the inverse function (assuming one exists) from the inverse image function (which again relates the powersets). Given the right context, this keeps the notation light and usually does not cause confusion. But if needed, an alternative is to give explicit names for the image and preimage as functions between power sets:

===Arrow notation===

* formula_98 with formula_99
* formula_100 with formula_101

===Star notation===

* formula_102 instead of formula_103
* formula_104 instead of formula_105

===Other terminology===

* An alternative notation for formula_106 used in mathematical logic and set theory is formula_107
* Some texts refer to the image of formula_3 as the range of formula_29 but this usage should be avoided because the word &quot;range&quot; is also commonly used to mean the codomain of formula_60

==Examples==
# formula_111 defined by formula_112 The &quot;image&quot; of the set formula_113 under formula_3 is formula_115 The &quot;image&quot; of the function formula_3 is formula_117 The &quot;preimage&quot; of formula_118 is formula_119 The &quot;preimage&quot; of formula_120 is also formula_121 The &quot;preimage&quot; of formula_122 under formula_3 is the empty set formula_124
# formula_125 defined by formula_126 The &quot;image&quot; of formula_127 under formula_3 is formula_129 and the &quot;image&quot; of formula_3 is formula_131 (the set of all positive real numbers and zero). The &quot;preimage&quot; of formula_132 under formula_3 is formula_134 The &quot;preimage&quot; of set formula_135 under formula_3 is the empty set, because the negative numbers do not have square roots in the set of reals.
# formula_137 defined by formula_138 The &quot;fibers&quot; formula_139 are concentric circles about the origin, the origin itself, and the empty set (respectively), depending on whether formula_140 (respectively). (If formula_141 then the &quot;fiber&quot; formula_139 is the set of all formula_143 satisfying the equation formula_144 that is, the origin-centered circle with radius formula_145)
# If formula_146 is a manifold and formula_147 is the canonical projection from the tangent bundle formula_148 to formula_149 then the &quot;fibers&quot; of formula_150 are the tangent spaces formula_151 This is also an example of a fiber bundle.
# A quotient group is a homomorphic &quot;image&quot;.

== Properties ==

=== General ===

For every function formula_23 and all subsets formula_153 and formula_154 the following properties hold:

Also:

* formula_155

=== Multiple functions ===

For functions formula_23 and formula_157 with subsets formula_153 and formula_159 the following properties hold:

* formula_160
* formula_161

=== Multiple subsets of domain or codomain ===

For function formula_23 and subsets formula_163 and formula_164 the following properties hold:

The results relating images and preimages to the (Boolean) algebra of intersection and union work for any collection of subsets, not just for pairs of subsets:

* formula_165
* formula_166
* formula_167
* formula_168
(Here, formula_169 can be infinite, even uncountably infinite.)

With respect to the algebra of subsets described above, the inverse image function is a lattice homomorphism, while the image function is only a semilattice homomorphism (that is, it does not always preserve intersections).

<doc id="579316" wikidata="Q109002196" url="?curid=579316" title="Red River College Polytechnic">
<text>Red River College Polytechnic (RRC Polytech) is a college located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is the province&#x27;s largest institute of applied learning and applied research, with over 200 degree, diploma, and certificate programs, and more than 21,000 students annually.

Between 6,000 and 8,000 students attend daily, as well as students registered in continuing and distance education programs. RRC Polytech hosts approximately 1500 international students each year, from over 60 countries.

It has over 200 full-time programs in such areas as biotechnology, construction trades, digital multimedia, business, aerospace, nursing, engineering technology, as well as others.

RRC Polytech offers one year certificate, two- and three-year diploma, joint-degree and post-graduate advanced diploma programs. English as an Additional Language programs for international students begin each month. The college also offers three Kids Technology Camps throughout the year to introduce kids to technology. &quot;Girls Exploring Trades &amp; Technologies Camp&quot; is a program for girls 12 to 14, &quot;Technology Exploration Camp&quot; is a summer camp program for girls and boys aged 11 to 13, and &quot;Saturday Kids Kamps&quot; introduces Grade 7 students to Electrical Engineering Technology.

==History==
In 1963, the Notre Dame campus was built and the college name was changed to the Manitoba Institute of Technology (MIT). Half the campus was an arts and science complex, operating under the separate name Manitoba Institute of Applied Arts (MIAA). The two halves consolidated to a single name: Red River Community College (RRCC) in 1969. In 1998, it was renamed to &quot;Red River College of Applied Arts, Science, and Technology&quot;, or Red River College.

In 2004, the Princess Street Campus was built in Downtown Winnipeg, with a large focus on multimedia design, computer technology, and the popular Creative Communications program, which prepares students for careers in advertising, journalism, media production, and public relations.

In 2011, the Princess Street Campus was renamed to the Roblin Centre in honour of former Manitoba Premier Duff Roblin. The Roblin Centre, together with the Paterson GlobalFoods Institute is now known as the Exchange District Campus.

On July 4, 2012, the college discontinued over the air broadcasting of student radio station 92.9 Kick FM after nearly 10 years of broadcasting, due to a campus radio policy change by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

In 2021, the school rebranded from Red River College to Red River College Polytechnic, in line with plans to modernize apprenticeships and expand into applied research and hands-on learning. That same year the Exchange District Campus was expanded with the completion of the Manitou a bi Bii daziigae innovation centre.

In 2022, the Manitoba government pledged to invest more than in funding for a new interdisciplinary health and community services simulation centre at the Notre Dame Campus in Winnipeg, to be called the Health Sciences and Community Services Simulation Centre. The facility was expected to be completed within two years, and is expected to support 115 new post-secondary nursing seats. The new centre will span and will house a triage station, hospital ward, high-fidelity healthcare simulation room, phlebotomy laboratory, apartment, and exam room for experiential learning, plus academic classrooms and office space.

===Notre Dame Campus===
Located near the intersection of Notre Dame Avenue and King Edward Street (Route 90), the Notre Dame Campus features fitness facilities with cardio, weight equipment, shower facilities, cardio and yoga classes, playing fields and running paths. The campus also has a Print Shoppe, library and student parking lots as well as cafeterias.

The RRC Polytech Students&#x27; Association (RRCSA) operates a convenience store at the Notre Dame Campus called &quot;The Ox&quot;.

===Exchange District Campus===
====Roblin Centre====

Located at 160 Princess Street in Winnipeg&#x27;s Exchange District, the Roblin Centre (formerly known as the Princess Street Campus) is home to approximately 200 staff and 2,000 students. The Centre has a focus on modern media, information technology, and business.

The building features the original façades along Princess Street, and incorporates modern green building technology. The Roblin Centre&#x27;s construction merged five prominent heritage buildings on Princess Street as well as a 1905 warehouse on William Avenue. The merging of these buildings incorporates a former lane into the current Atrium. Many of the architectural features of the original buildings, such as wood columns, floors, brickwork, millwork, and windows were restored and incorporated into the new structure.

The Roblin Centre has a building energy management system and is the largest C-2000*
building in Canada. The Centre was completed before the advent of LEED Certification in Canada, but the environmental performance of this project would put it at the level of LEED Gold or Platinum. The Centre was the largest Canadian project to date involving extensive material re-use, and incorporates a 34 kW building-integrated photovoltaic system which was the largest of its kind at the time of installation.

The Roblin Centre features fitness facilities, Campus Store, a library and a full-service Tim Hortons.

Similar to &quot;The Ox&quot; at the Notre Dame Campus, the RRCSA operated a convenience store at the Roblin Centre called &quot;The Mercantile&quot;. The store closed in 2019 and was not re-opened the following year on account of the COVID-19 pandemic and as of Oct 2022, had not re-opened.

====Paterson GlobalFoods Institute====

The Paterson GlobalFoods Institute is the home of the Culinary Arts, Hospitality and Tourism Management and Professional Baking and Patisserie programs. Located in the Exchange District, the Institute was completed in January 2013.

In May 2009, the Government of Canada pledged the college with $9.5-million of funding to help reconstruct the Union Bank Building at the corner of Main Street and William Avenue in downtown Winnipeg. The Manitoba government also announced it would contribute $5-million for the construction of the building.

The Institute is located in the Union Bank Building in Winnipeg&#x27;s Exchange District, an 11-storey building that dates back to 1903. The institute provides classroom and kitchen space and two restaurants on the first three floors, as well as residence for 103 students on the floors above. The renovation is expected to cost $34 million, up from the initial $27 million estimate, and involved the addition of two new glass fronted structures adjacent to the existing Union Bank Building. The new adjacent structures were required for the project, as the tower itself could not house the necessary heating and cooling systems. The Union Bank Tower is the last skyscraper of this vintage remaining in Canada, and had been sitting vacant since 1992.

====Manitou a bi Bii daziigae====

Manitou a bi Bii daziigae is a building in the Exchange District campus, with 18 classrooms and five labs. The building&#x27;s name is in Anishinaabemowin (Ojibwe) and translates to Where Creator sits (Manitou a bi) and Brings light (Bii daziigae). Construction for the 100,000 sqft facility began in 2018 and completed in 2021, with a cost of $95 million.

==Scholarships &amp; bursaries==
The Government of Canada sponsors an Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool that lists over 680 scholarships, bursaries, and other incentives offered by governments, universities, and industry to support Aboriginal post-secondary participation.

RRC Polytech scholarships for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include:
* Manitoba Hydro Electrical Technology Scholarship
* Hannah (Nancy) Boon Bursary
* &quot;Our Children, Our Ways&quot; Distance Education Award
* West Region Child and Family Services Residential Care Unit Award
* Project Neecheewan Award
* Technical Communication Faculty Scholarship
* Pitblado LLP Legal Administrative Assistant Awards
* Employment Equity Education Awards

==Student life==
===Athletics===
Until 2022, RRC Polytech&#x27;s Rebels Athletics had the following groups:
* Men&#x27;s Volleyball
* Men&#x27;s Basketball
* Men&#x27;s Soccer
* Men&#x27;s Futsal
* Women&#x27;s Volleyball
* Women&#x27;s Basketball

* Women&#x27;s Futsal

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, basketball and soccer teams competed in the Manitoba Colleges Athletic Conference (MCAC).

The school announced January 13, 2022, that it would be eliminating the Rebels athletic program. The varsity sports teams at RRC Polytech competed for over 50 years prior to being cut.

===Newspaper===
The official newspaper of RRC Polytech is &quot;The Projector&quot;, which is published by the RRC Polytech Students’ Association every second Monday. The Projector has been the official RRC Polytech student newspaper since 1967.

===Restaurants===
Until December 2012, Red River College students operated &quot;Prairie Lights&quot;, a fine dining restaurant at the Notre Dame Campus. The restaurant featured full service lunch and dinner menus from September to November and March to May. The evening program featured flambé service and was licensed for alcohol service. The restaurant provided practical experience to the students of the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management programs, and also functioned as a catering room for the Food Services Department for private functions. The restaurant was open to the public. In December 2012, the restaurant closed, with plans to move the program to Jane&#x27;s, a fine dining restaurant at the Paterson GlobalFoods Institute.

The restaurants in the Paterson GlobalFoods Institute opened to the public in early 2013. The Culinary Exchange café opened on 15 January 2013, and Jane&#x27;s opened 21 February 2013.

===Radio station===
Students in RRC Polytech&#x27;s Creative Communications program run an online radio station known as &quot;Red River Radio&quot;. The radio station is an opportunity for students to host, program and produce both music and news/talk format radio, and features music and talk shows, as well as news, sports, and weather.

Launched on August 24, 2012, the online radio station replaces the over-the-air local radio station formerly run by the College, 92.9 Kick FM. The online station follows similar format to the discontinued broadcast station, with 24-hour programming and a focus on local indie rock and folk bands.

===Directions conference===
RRC Polytech operates a yearly Business and Applied Arts conference called &quot;Directions&quot;. The conference promotes networking between current students and potential employers, and promotes career areas such as Business Administration, Indigenous Education, Continuing Education as well as Hospitality and Tourism.

<doc id="579319" wikidata="Q6445546" url="?curid=579319" title="Kural (poetic form)">
<text>The Kural is one of the most important forms of classical Tamil language poetry. It is a very short poetic form being an independent couplet complete in 2 lines, the first line consisting of 4 words and the second line consisting of 3. As one of the five types of Venpa stanza, it must also conform to the grammar for Venpa, the most difficult and the most highly esteemed of stanzaic structures in classical Tamil literature. The &quot;Tirukkuṛaḷ&quot; by Tiruvalluvar, one of the greatest philosophical works in Tamil, is a typical example.

==Structure==
===Prosodic background===
The Tamil conception of metrical structure includes elements that appear in no other major prosodic system. This discussion is presented in terms of syllables, feet, and lines (although syllables are not explicitly present in Tamil prosodic theory).

Similarly to classical Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit prosody, a syllable is long if its vowel is (1) long (including diphthongs) or (2) followed by two or more consonants. Generally other syllables are short, though some syllables are considered &quot;overshort&quot; and ignored in the metrical scheme, while &quot;overlong&quot; syllables are variously dealt with.

===Metrical structure===
 is a closely related family of very strict Tamil verse forms. They differ chiefly in the number of standard lines that occur before the final short line. In (or simply &quot;kural&quot;) a single 4-foot (&quot;standard&quot;) line is followed by a final 3-foot (&quot;short&quot;) line, resulting in a 7-foot couplet. Syntactically, each foot normally consists of only a single word, but may also consist of two words if they are very closely linked (for example, in apposition). Metrically, the first six feet are all identical, conforming to this structure:

 (u)x (u)x (x)

:u = 1 short syllable
:x = 1 short or 1 long syllable (&quot;anceps&quot; in Western parlance)
:( ) = the enclosed syllable is optional

This very flexible structure would generate 48 possible syllabic patterns, but two additional constraints apply: 
# The initial (u)x may not be realized by u alone.
# The final anceps is prohibited if the second (u)x is realized by u alone.

...leaving 30 possible syllabic patterns per foot, each realized with two to five syllables:

 – u
 – – (x)
 – uu (x)
 – u– (x)
 uu u
 uu – (x)
 uu uu (x)
 uu u– (x)
 u– u
 u– – (x)
 u– uu (x)
 u– u– (x)

:– = long syllable
:(x) represents 3 possibilities: absent, u (short), or – (long)

The kural&#x27;s final foot is essentially a much-shortened version. The structure of the entire couplet is thus:

 (u)x (u)x (x) | (u)x (u)x (x) | (u)x (u)x (x) | (u)x (u)x (x)
 (u)x (u)x (x) | (u)x (u)x (x) | (u)x

:| = division between feet (and words)

In actual composition, syllabic patterns are limited further, because every realized foot places constraints upon the syllabic pattern of the &quot;following&quot; foot, thus:
* When the final optional anceps of a foot is PRESENT, the next foot must not begin with a short syllable.
* When the final optional anceps of a foot is ABSENT AND …
** The middle optional short syllable is PRESENT, the next foot must not begin with a short syllable.
** The middle optional short syllable is ABSENT, the next foot must begin with a short syllable.

===Ornamentation===
One ornamental feature of Tamil versification is , often translated &quot;rhyme&quot;, although it is distinct from typical Western rhyme. This occurs often in kural, but is not obligatory. There is variance in Tamil practice, but in a kural couplet, is usually more or less equivalent to the &quot;exact repetition of the initial line&#x27;s second syllable as the final line&#x27;s second syllable&quot;. An example (not in a kural, but in a four-line ) is:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;
 &lt;/poem&gt;

Sometimes additional syllables, beyond the second, are also repeated.

<text>The fairness doctrine of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), introduced in 1949, was a policy that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that fairly reflected differing viewpoints. In 1987, the FCC abolished the fairness doctrine, prompting some to urge its reintroduction through either Commission policy or congressional legislation. The FCC removed the rule that implemented the policy from the &quot;Federal Register&quot; in August 2011.

The fairness doctrine had two basic elements: It required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters. Stations were given wide latitude as to how to provide contrasting views: It could be done through news segments, public affairs shows, or editorials. The doctrine did not require equal time for opposing views but required that contrasting viewpoints be presented. The demise of this FCC rule has been cited as a contributing factor in the rising level of party polarization in the United States.

While the original purpose of the doctrine was to ensure that viewers were exposed to a diversity of viewpoints, it was used by both the Kennedy and later the Johnson administration to combat political opponents operating on talk radio. In 1969 the United States Supreme Court, in &quot;Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC&quot;, upheld the FCC&#x27;s general right to enforce the fairness doctrine where channels were limited. However, the court did not rule that the FCC was &quot;obliged&quot; to do so. The courts reasoned that the scarcity of the broadcast spectrum, which limited the opportunity for access to the airwaves, created a need for the doctrine.

The fairness doctrine is not the same as the equal-time rule, which is still in place. The fairness doctrine deals with discussion of controversial issues, while the equal-time rule deals only with political candidates.

==Origins==
In 1938, Lawrence J. Flynn, a former Yankee Network employee, challenged the license of John Shepard III&#x27;s WAAB in Boston, and lodged a complaint about WNAC. Flynn asserted that these stations were being used to air one-sided political viewpoints and broadcast attacks, including editorials, against local and federal politicians that Shepard opposed. The FCC requested that Shepard provide details about these programs. To appease the commission, the Yankee Network agreed to drop the editorials. 

Flynn created a company called Mayflower Broadcasting and tried to get the FCC to award him WAAB&#x27;s license. The FCC refused. In 1941, the commission made a ruling that came to be known as the Mayflower Decision, which declared that radio stations, due to their public interest obligations, must remain neutral in matters of news and politics, and they were not allowed to give editorial support to any particular political position or candidate.

In 1949, the FCC&#x27;s Editorializing Report repealed the Mayflower doctrine, which since 1941 had forbidden on-air editorializing. This laid the foundation for the fairness doctrine, by reaffirming the FCC&#x27;s holding that licensees must not use their stations &quot;for the private interest, whims or caprices [of licensees], but in a manner which will serve the community generally.&quot; 

The FCC Report established two forms of regulation on broadcasters: to provide adequate coverage of public issues, and to ensure that coverage fairly represented opposing views. The second rule required broadcasters to provide reply time to issue-oriented citizens. Broadcasters could therefore trigger fairness doctrine complaints without editorializing. The commission required neither of the fairness doctrine&#x27;s obligations before 1949. Until then broadcasters had to satisfy only general &quot;public interest&quot; standards of the Communications Act.

The doctrine remained a matter of general policy and was applied on a case-by-case basis until 1967, when certain provisions of the doctrine were incorporated into FCC regulations.

In 1969, the United States courts of appeals, in an opinion written by Warren Burger, directed the FCC to revoke Lamar Broadcasting&#x27;s license for television station WLBT due to the station&#x27;s segregationist politics and ongoing censorship of NBC network news coverage of the U.S. civil rights movement.

== Application of the doctrine by the FCC ==
In 1974, the Federal Communications Commission stated that the Congress had delegated the power to mandate a system of &quot;access, either free or paid, for person or groups wishing to express a viewpoint on a controversial public issue&quot; but that it had not yet exercised that power because licensed broadcasters had &quot;voluntarily&quot; complied with the &quot;spirit&quot; of the doctrine. It warned that: 

In one landmark case, the FCC argued that teletext was a new technology that created soaring demand for a limited resource, and thus could be exempt from the fairness doctrine. The Telecommunications Research and Action Center (TRAC) and Media Access Project (MAP) argued that teletext transmissions should be regulated like any other airwave technology, hence the fairness doctrine was applicable, and must be enforced by the FCC. In 1986, Judges Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the fairness doctrine did apply to teletext, but that the FCC was not required to apply it.  In a 1987 case, &quot;Meredith Corp. v. FCC&quot;, two other judges on the same court declared that Congress did not mandate the doctrine and the FCC did not have to continue to enforce it.

==Decisions of the United States Supreme Court==
In &quot;Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC&quot;, , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld, by a vote of 8–0, the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine in a case of an on-air personal attack, in response to challenges that the doctrine violated the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The case began when journalist Fred J. Cook, after the publication of his &quot;Goldwater: Extremist of the Right&quot;, was the topic of discussion by Billy James Hargis on his daily &quot;Christian Crusade&quot; radio broadcast on WGCB in Red Lion, Pennsylvania. Cook sued arguing that the fairness doctrine entitled him to free air time to respond to the personal attacks.

Although similar laws are unconstitutional when applied to the press, the court cited a Senate report (S. Rep. No. 562, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 8-9 [1959]) stating that radio stations could be regulated in this way because of the limited public airwaves at the time. Writing for the court, Justice Byron White declared:

The court did not see how the fairness doctrine went against the First Amendment&#x27;s goal of creating an informed public. The fairness doctrine required that those who were talked about be given chance to respond to the statements made by broadcasters. The court believed that this helped create a more informed public. Justice White explained that, without this doctrine, station owners would only have people on the air who agreed with their opinions. Throughout his opinion, Justice White argued that radio frequencies, and by extension, television stations, should be used to educate listeners, or viewers, about controversial issues in a way that is fair and non-biased so that they can create their own opinions. 

In 1969, the court &quot;ruled unanimously that the Fairness Doctrine was not only constitutional, but essential to democracy. The public airwaves should not just express the opinions of those who can pay for air time; they must allow the electorate to be informed about all sides of controversial issues.&quot; The court also warned that if the doctrine ever restrained speech, then its constitutionality should be reconsidered. Justice William O. Douglas did not participate, but later wrote that he would have dissented because the Constitutional guarantee of Freedom of the press was absolute.

However, in the case of &quot;Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo&quot;, , Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote (for a unanimous court):
This decision differs from &quot;Red Lion v. FCC&quot; in that it applies to a newspaper, which, unlike a broadcaster, is unlicensed and can theoretically face an unlimited number of competitors.

In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could not forbid editorials by non-profit stations that received grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (&quot;FCC v. League of Women Voters of California&quot;, ). The court&#x27;s 5-4 majority decision by William J. Brennan Jr. stated that while many now considered that expanding sources of communication had made the fairness doctrine&#x27;s limits unnecessary: 
After noting that the FCC was considering repealing the fairness doctrine rules on editorials and personal attacks out of fear that those rules might be &quot;chilling speech&quot;, the court added: 

==Use in political leveraging==

Various presidential governments used the Fairness Doctrine to counter their political opponents. At the FCC, Martin Firestone&#x27;s memorandum to the Democratic National Committee presented political strategies to combat small, rural radio stations unfriendly to Democratic politicians:

The right-wingers operate on a strictly-cash basis and it is for this reason that they are carried by so many small [radio] stations. Were our efforts to be continued on a year-round basis, we would find that many of these stations would consider the broadcasts of these programs bothersome and burdensome (especially if they are ultimately required to give us free time) and would start dropping the programs from their broadcast schedule.

The use of the fairness doctrine by the National Council for Civic Responsibility (NCCR) was to urge right-wing radio stations to air rebuttals against the opinions expressed on their radio stations.

== Revocation ==
=== Basic doctrine ===
In 1985, under FCC Chairman Mark S. Fowler, a communications attorney who had served on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign staff in 1976 and 1980, the FCC released its report on &quot;General Fairness Doctrine Obligations&quot; stating that the doctrine hurt the public interest and violated free speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. The commission could not, however, come to a determination as to whether the doctrine had been enacted by Congress through its 1959 Amendment to Section 315 of the Communications Act.

In response to the 1986 &quot;Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center v. F.C.C.&quot; decision, the 99th Congress directed the FCC to examine alternatives to the fairness doctrine and to submit a report to Congress on the subject. In 1987, in &quot;Meredith Corporation v. F.C.C.&quot; the case was returned to the FCC with a directive to consider whether the doctrine had been &quot;self-generated pursuant to its general congressional authorization or specifically mandated by Congress.&quot;

The FCC opened an inquiry inviting public comment on alternative means for administrating and enforcing the fairness doctrine. In its 1987 report, the alternatives—including abandoning a case-by-case enforcement approach, replacing the doctrine with open access time for all members of the public, doing away with the personal attack rule, and eliminating certain other aspects of the doctrine—were rejected by the FCC for various reasons.

On August 4, 1987, under FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick, the FCC abolished the doctrine by a 4–0 vote, in the &quot;Syracuse Peace Council&quot; decision, which was upheld by a panel of the Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit in February 1989, though the court stated in their decision that they made &quot;that determination without reaching the constitutional issue.&quot; The FCC suggested in &quot;Syracuse Peace Council&quot; that because of the many media voices in the marketplace, the doctrine be deemed unconstitutional, stating that: 

At the 4–0 vote, Chairman Patrick said:

Sitting commissioners at the time of the vote were:

* Dennis R. Patrick, chairman, Republican(Named an FCC commissioner by Ronald Reagan in 1983)
* Mimi Weyforth Dawson, Republican(Named an FCC commissioner by Ronald Reagan in 1986)
* Patricia Diaz Dennis, Democrat(Named an FCC commissioner by Ronald Reagan in 1986)
* James Henry Quello, Democrat(Named an FCC commissioner by Richard M. Nixon in 1974)

The FCC vote was opposed by members of Congress who said the FCC had tried to &quot;flout the will of Congress&quot; and the decision was &quot;wrongheaded, misguided and illogical&quot;. The decision drew political fire, and cooperation with Congress was one issue. In June 1987, Congress attempted to preempt the FCC decision and codify the fairness doctrine, but the legislation was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan. In 1991, another attempt to revive the doctrine was stopped when President George H. W. Bush threatened another veto.

In February 2009, Fowler said that his work toward revoking the fairness doctrine under the Reagan administration had been a matter of principle, his belief that the doctrine impinged upon the First Amendment, not partisanship. Fowler described the White House staff raising concerns, at a time before the prominence of conservative talk radio and during the preeminence of the Big Three television networks and PBS in political discourse, that repealing the policy would be politically unwise. He described the staff&#x27;s position as saying to Reagan: 

=== Conservative talk radio ===
The 1987 repeal of the fairness doctrine enabled the rise of talk radio that has been described as &quot;unfiltered&quot;, divisive and/or vicious: &quot;In 1988, a savvy former ABC Radio executive named Ed McLaughlin signed Rush Limbaugh — then working at a little-known Sacramento station — to a nationwide syndication contract. McLaughlin offered Limbaugh to stations at an unbeatable price: free. All they had to do to carry his program was to set aside four minutes per hour for ads that McLaughlin&#x27;s company sold to national sponsors. The stations got to sell the remaining commercial time to local advertisers.&quot;

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;From his earliest days on the air, Limbaugh trafficked in conspiracy theories, divisiveness, even viciousness&quot;, e.g., &quot;feminazis&quot;. Prior to 1987 people using much less controversial verbiage had been taken off the air as obvious violations of the fairness doctrine.

=== Corollary rules ===

Two corollary rules of the doctrine, the personal attack rule and the &quot;political editorial&quot; rule, remained in practice until 2000. The &quot;personal attack&quot; rule applied whenever a person, or small group, was subject to a personal attack during a broadcast. Stations had to notify such persons, or groups, within a week of the attack, send them transcripts of what was said and offer the opportunity to respond on-the-air. The &quot;political editorial&quot; rule applied when a station broadcast editorials endorsing or opposing candidates for public office, and stipulated that the unendorsed candidates be notified and allowed a reasonable opportunity to respond.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ordered the FCC to justify these corollary rules in light of the decision to repeal the fairness doctrine. The FCC did not provide prompt justification, so both corollary rules were repealed in October 2000.

== Reinstatement considered ==
=== Support ===
In February 2005, U.S. Representative Louise Slaughter (D-NY) and 23 co-sponsors introduced the Fairness and Accountability in Broadcasting Act (H.R. 501) in the 1st session of the 109th Congress of 2005-2007, when Republicans held a majority of both Houses. The bill would have shortened a station&#x27;s license term from eight years to four, with the requirement that a license-holder cover important issues fairly, hold local public hearings about its coverage twice a year, and document to the FCC how it was meeting its obligations. The bill was referred to committee, but progressed no further.

In the same Congress, Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) introduced legislation &quot;to restore the Fairness Doctrine&quot;. H.R. 3302, also known as the &quot;Media Ownership Reform Act of 2005&quot; or MORA, had 16 co-sponsors in Congress.

In June 2007, Senator Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) said, &quot;It&#x27;s time to reinstitute the Fairness Doctrine&quot;, an opinion shared by his Democratic colleague, Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.). However, according to Marin Cogan of &quot;The New Republic&quot; in late 2008: 
On June 24, 2008, U.S. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the Speaker of the House at the time, told reporters that her fellow Democratic representatives did not want to forbid reintroduction of the fairness doctrine, adding &quot;the interest in my caucus is the reverse.&quot; When asked by John Gizzi of &quot;Human Events&quot;, &quot;Do you personally support revival of the &#x27;Fairness Doctrine?, the Speaker replied &quot;Yes&quot;.

On December 15, 2008, U.S. Representative Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) told &quot;The Daily Post&quot; in Palo Alto, California that she thought it should also apply to cable and satellite broadcasters, stating:

On February 11, 2009, Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) told radio host Bill Press, &quot;we gotta get the Fairness Doctrine back in law again.&quot; Later in response to Press&#x27;s assertion that &quot;they are just shutting down progressive talk from one city after another&quot;, Senator Harkin responded, &quot;Exactly, and that&#x27;s why we need the fairthat&#x27;s why we need the Fairness Doctrine back.&quot;

Former President Bill Clinton has also shown support for the fairness doctrine. During a February 13, 2009, appearance on the Mario Solis Marich radio show, Clinton said:
Clinton cited the &quot;blatant drumbeat&quot; against the stimulus program from conservative talk radio, suggesting that it does not reflect economic reality.

On September 19, 2019, Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) introduced H.R. 4401 Restore the Fairness Doctrine Act of 2019 in the House of Representatives, 116th Congress. Rep. Gabbard was the only sponsor. H.R. 4401 was immediately referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day. It was then referred to the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology on September 20, 2019.

H.R. 4401 would mandate equal media discussion of key political and social topics, requiring television and radio broadcasters to give airtime to opposing sides of issues of civic interest. The summary reads: &quot;Restore the Fairness Doctrine Act of 2019. This bill requires a broadcast radio or television licensee to provide reasonable opportunity for discussion of conflicting views on matters of public importance. The Restore the Fairness Doctrine Act would once again mandate television and radio broadcasters present both sides when discussing political or social issues, reinstituting the rule in place from 1949 to 1987 ... . Supporters argue that the doctrine allowed for a more robust public debate and affected positive political change as a result, rather than allowing only the loudest voices or deepest pockets to win.&quot;

=== Opposition ===
The fairness doctrine has been strongly opposed by prominent conservatives and libertarians who view it as an attack on First Amendment rights and property rights. Editorials in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The Washington Times&quot; in 2005 and 2008 said that Democratic attempts to bring back the fairness doctrine have been made largely in response to conservative talk radio.

In 1987, Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, in applauding President Reagan&#x27;s veto of a bill intended to turn the doctrine into law, said that the doctrine is an infringement on free speech and intrudes on broadcasters&#x27; journalistic judgment.

In 2007, Senator Norm Coleman (R-MN) proposed an amendment to a defense appropriations bill that forbade the FCC from &quot;using any funds to adopt a fairness rule.&quot; It was blocked, in part on grounds that &quot;the amendment belonged in the Commerce Committee&#x27;s jurisdiction.&quot;

In 2007, the Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007 was proposed in the Senate by Senators Coleman with 35 co-sponsors (S.1748) and John Thune (R-SD), with 8 co-sponsors (S.1742), and in the House by Republican Representative Mike Pence (R-IN) with 208 co-sponsors (H.R. 2905). It provided:
Neither of these measures came to the floor of either house.

On August 12, 2008, FCC Commissioner Robert M. McDowell stated that the reinstitution of the fairness doctrine could be intertwined with the debate over network neutrality (a proposal to classify network operators as common carriers required to admit all Internet services, applications and devices on equal terms), presenting a potential danger that net neutrality and fairness doctrine advocates could try to expand content controls to the Internet. It could also include &quot;government dictating content policy&quot;. The conservative Media Research Center&#x27;s Culture &amp; Media Institute argued that the three main points supporting the fairness doctrine — media scarcity, liberal viewpoints being censored at a corporate level, and public interest — are all myths.

In June 2008, Barack Obama&#x27;s press secretary wrote that Obama, then a Democratic U.S. senator from Illinois and candidate for president, did not support it, stating:
On February 16, 2009, Mark Fowler said:
In February 2009, a White House spokesperson said that President Obama continued to oppose the revival of the doctrine.

In the 111th Congress, January 2009 to January 2011, the Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2009 (S.34, S.62, H.R.226) was introduced to block reinstatement of the doctrine. On February 26, 2009, by a vote of 87–11, the Senate added that act as an amendment to the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 (S.160), a bill which later passed the Senate 61–37 but not the House of Representatives. 

The Associated Press reported that the vote on the fairness doctrine rider was &quot;in part a response to conservative radio talk show hosts who feared that Democrats would try to revive the policy to ensure liberal opinions got equal time.&quot; The AP report went on to say that President Obama had no intention of reimposing the doctrine, but Republicans, led by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-SC, wanted more in the way of a guarantee that the doctrine would not be reimposed.

===Suggested alternatives===
Media reform organizations such as Free Press feel that a return to the fairness doctrine is not as important as setting stronger station ownership caps and stronger &quot;public interest&quot; standards enforcement, with funding from fines given to public broadcasting.

===Public opinion===
In an August 2008 telephone poll, released by Rasmussen Reports, 47% of 1,000 likely voters supported a government requirement that broadcasters offer equal amounts of liberal and conservative commentary. 39% opposed such a requirement. In the same poll, 57% opposed and 31% favored requiring Internet websites and bloggers that offer political commentary to present opposing points of view. By a margin of 71–20%, the respondents agreed that it is &quot;possible for just about any political view to be heard in today&#x27;s media&quot;, including the Internet, newspapers, cable TV and satellite radio, but only half the sample said they had followed recent news stories about the fairness doctrine closely. The margin of error was 3%, with a 95% confidence interval.

==Formal revocation==
In June 2011, the chairman and a subcommittee chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, both Republicans, said that the FCC, in response to their requests, had set a target date of August 2011 for removing the fairness doctrine and other &quot;outdated&quot; regulations from the FCC&#x27;s rulebook.

On August 22, 2011, the FCC voted to remove the rule that implemented the fairness doctrine, along with more than 80 other rules and regulations, from the &quot;Federal Register&quot; following an executive order by President Obama directing a &quot;government-wide review of regulations already on the books&quot; to eliminate unnecessary regulations.

<text>Ultramarine are an English electronic music duo, formed in 1989 by Ian Cooper and Paul Hammond. Their work blends elements of techno, house and ambient music with acoustic instrumentation, the influence of the 1970s Canterbury scene, and other eclectic sources. They are best known for their 1991 album &quot;Every Man and Woman Is a Star&quot;, reissued on Rough Trade the following year.

==Biography==
Cooper and Hammond first worked together in the band, A Primary Industry, during the mid-1980s. Following the split of that band, they formed Ultramarine and released their debut album &quot;Folk&quot; in April 1990 on the Belgian label Les Disques du Crépuscule. The duo&#x27;s second long player, &quot;Every Man and Woman Is a Star&quot; (initially released in 1991 by Brainiak Records and reissued as an expanded version by Rough Trade in 1992), was described by music writer Simon Reynolds in his book &quot;Energy Flash&quot; as &quot;Perhaps the first and best stab at that seeming contradiction-in-terms, pastoral techno... all sun-ripened, meandering lassitude and undulant dub-sway tempos... like acid-house suffused with the folky-jazzy ambience of the Canterbury scene.&quot;

Live appearances during this period included a US tour in 1992 with Meat Beat Manifesto and Orbital and US and European tours in 1993 supporting Björk. The group&#x27;s collaborative work has included a songwriting and recording partnership with Robert Wyatt, recordings with Kevin Ayers and David McAlmont, plus numerous live and studio sessions with members of the London jazz scene, including Lol Coxhill, Elton Dean, Dave Green, Roger Beaujolais, Greg Heath and Jimmy Hastings.

&quot;Every Man and Woman Is a Star&quot; was followed by the albums &quot;United Kingdoms&quot; (1993), which features an extensive collaboration with Robert Wyatt, &quot;Bel Air&quot; (1995) and &quot;A User&#x27;s Guide&quot; (1998). After a long sabbatical, the group released their sixth album, &quot;This Time Last Year&quot; in 2013. &quot;Every Man and Woman Is a Star&quot; was reissued by Rough Trade in 2014 as a triple vinyl set, including a previously unreleased 1992 John Peel BBC Radio 1 session.

Ultramarine simultaneously released a double-album &quot;Signals into Space&quot; and a mini-album &quot;Meditations&quot; on Les Disques du Crépuscule in 2019. &quot;Signals into Space&quot; includes songs written in collaboration with Anna Domino and contributions from saxophonist Iain Ballamy.

The group appears on Woo&#x27;s album &quot;Arcturian Corridor&quot; (2020), remixing the track &quot;Arc II&quot;.

<text>Koninklijke KPN N.V. (Royal KPN N.V. in English), trading as KPN is a Dutch telecommunications company. KPN originated from a government-run postal, telegraph and telephone service and is based in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

==History==
===Until 1998===
What is now KPN was first officially established as a postal service called the Statenpost in 1752. In 1799, Dutch postal services were reformed into a single, national system, and in 1807, was placed under the administration of the Ministry of Finance. In 1893, postal system and telegraph and telephone services were brought together to form the Staatsbedrijf der Posterijen, Telegrafie en Telefonie (approximately, “National corporation for Postage, Telegraphy and Telephony”), shortened to PTT or internationally as PTT-NL, under the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce.

Around a hundred years later, post codes were introduced in the Netherlands in 1977, which allowed full automation of the postal system. On 1 January 1989, the PTT was corporatised and reorganised as a private business known as Koninklijke PTT Nederland (“Royal PTT Netherlands”), shortened to KPN or PTT Nederland. KPN remained wholly owned but no longer managed by the Dutch government. Its postal service was called PTT Post while its telecom service was called PTT Telecom, both independent from each other.

In 1992, KPN cofounded GD Express Worldwide (GDEW) with TNT and the state owned postal companies of Canada, France, West Germany and Sweden. KPN later bought out the shares held by the state owned postal companies, owning a total of 50% shareholding of GDEW.

KPN took over its GDEW partner TNT between October 1996 and January 1997. KPN also controlled the national Dutch postal services until its postal division was spun-off and merged with TNT to form TNT Post Group (TPG) in 1998.

The Dutch government progressively privatised KPN beginning in 1994, with KPN listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, then reduced its stake to 6.4% in 2005, and finally completed the process in 2006, giving up its golden share veto rights.

===Since 1998===
In 2001 KPN tried to merge with the Belgian telco Belgacom. It did not succeed because of the objections of the Belgian government. In 2001, Spanish Telefonica expressed an interest in buying KPN.

The Japanese mobile telephone company NTT DoCoMo holds a 2% stake in KPN Mobile NV. From 2002 until 2007 KPN Mobile provided i-mode services on its mobile phone networks. i-mode as introduced by KPN&#x27;s E-Plus in Germany in March 2002 and by KPN Mobile The Netherlands in April 2002 was the first mobile Internet service in Europe (ahead of Vodafone&#x27;s V-live).

KPN partly owned KPNQwest, a telecommunications company equally owned by KPN and the American Qwest Communications International. The company was set to bring together the state-of-the-art fibre-optic networks of the two partners and the Internet services expertise and customer base of EUnet International. The company collapsed in a bankruptcy in 2002.

KPN also has operational synergies through joint ventures with TDC and Swisscom.

In 2007 KPN acquired Getronics N.V., a worldwide ICT services company with more than 22,000 employees, and almost doubled its former size. KPN is still divesting parts of Getronics that didn&#x27;t meet their core interests. Recently they sold a Dutch department of Getronics named Business Application Services (BAS) to CapGemini for about €250,000,000.

In August 2013, América Móvil offered to take over the remaining 70% stake of the Dutch telecommunications company for 7.2 billion Euros ($9.49 billion). América Móvil currently owns close to 30% of KPN. The Dutch Government has issued a warning on this proposed takeover of KPN by Mexican Billionaire Carlos Slim, as part of his ambition to expand his telecom empire. The plans eventually ended when the &quot;Stichting Preferente Aandelen B KPN&quot; exercised a call option to gain ~50% of the total shares, in order to put up a temporary protection wall against the hostile takeover.

In November 2020, EQT AB offered to take over KPN for 11 billion Euros. Further in April 2021 EQT AB and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners jointly started work on a KPN takeover bid for 12.5 billion Euros.

On 10 June 2021, a fiber-optic joint venture called Glaspoort and based in Amsterdam was established, a partnership between KPN and pension fund APG to expand the supply of fiber. Glaspoort plans to connect some 750,000 households and about 225,000 businesses to fiber which will require an investment of over €1 billion over the next five years.

<doc id="579328" wikidata="Q124180" url="?curid=579328" title="Anton Kutter">
<text>Anton Kutter (13 June 1903, in Biberach an der Riß – 1 February 1985, in Biberach) was a German film director and screenwriter. He studied mechanical engineering at Stuttgart Technical University.

In 1926 Kutter went to Cologne and joined the Phototechnical Laboratory, and created his first films the same year. From 1931 to 1947 he worked for the Bavaria Film in Munich. In 1937 he made the science fiction movie, &quot;Weltraumschiff I startet&quot; [Space Ship I Launches], a story about a first Moon flight which he dated on 13 June 1963, his 60th birthday. Kutter was awarded two golden medals at the Venice Biennale.

Already at age 12, Kutter manufactured his first refracting telescope from lenses taken from a toy cinematograph. Later he became known to Anton Staus (1872-1955) who introduced him to the theory of &#x27;s &quot;Brachy&quot; telescopes. He invented the Schiefspiegler telescope which is a modified Cassegrain reflector featuring superb optical definition due to an off-axis secondary mirror. An obituary was published by Roger W. Sinnott in &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot;.

<text>:&quot;There are two places in New Zealand called Heretaunga. For the suburb of Upper Hutt, see Heretaunga, Wellington.&quot;
The Heretaunga Plains is a alluvial plain at the southern end of Hawke Bay on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The towns of Napier, Hastings and Havelock North are on the plain.

The plain was formed over the last 250,000 years from sediment deposited by the Tutaekuri, Ngaruroro and Tukituki Rivers and from coastal marine deposits. It consists of layers of gravel, sand and silt. Permeable gravel beds form aquifers and the artesian groundwater provides 85% of the requirements for public water supply, irrigation and industrial use on the Heretaunga Plains and adjacent areas.

The fertile soil, the warm, dry climate of the area, and the water for irrigation make the plain an excellent site for horticulture and agriculture. Half of the total New Zealand production of fruit, vegetables and grapes is on the Heretaunga Plains. It is one of New Zealand&#x27;s leading wine producing areas.

The Heretaunga Plains are named after a carved wharenui (meeting house) at Whatonga, and Māori migrating south have taken the name with them and given it to a watercourse now known as the Hutt River.

<text>Alexander Johnston Chalmers Skene (; 17 June 1837 – 4 July 1900) was a British-American gynaecologist from Scotland who described what became known as Skene&#x27;s glands.

==Biography==
Skene was born in Fyvie, Scotland, on 17 June 1837. At the age of 19, he went to North America. He studied medicine at King&#x27;s College (now the University of Toronto), then at the University of Michigan, and finally at the Long Island College Hospital (now the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center) in Brooklyn graduating in 1863. From July 1863 until June 1864, he was acting assistant surgeon in the U. S. Army, after which he entered private practice in Brooklyn and advanced to become Professor of Disease of Women at Long Island College Hospital. He was professor of gynaecology in the post-graduate Medical School of New York in 1884, and was president of the American Gynaecological Society.

Skene wrote over 100 medical articles and several textbooks. He contributed many surgical instruments and improved on surgical techniques. He performed the first successful operation of gastro-elytrotomy that is recorded, and also that of craniotomy, using Sims&#x27;s speculum. Primarily, he is remembered for his description of the Skene&#x27;s glands at the floor of the urethra. He also described their infection—&quot;skenitis&quot;. Skene collaborated with J. Marion Sims, who performed gynecologic exams and surgeries on enslaved African-American women without anesthesia, but Skene does not appear to be part of these experiments.

As a sculptor, Skene created a bust of Sims which is on display in the lobby of the Kings County Medical Society. A bust honoring Skene is located in Prospect Park Plaza (also known as Grand Army Plaza). This statue was proposed to be moved in 2011 to accommodate a statue of former U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, but this did not happen.

Skene died in his summerhouse in the Catskills, New York, on 4 July 1900. He left behind a son, Jonathan Bowers. He is buried at Rockland Cemetery in Sparkill, NY.

<doc id="579351" wikidata="Q187200" url="?curid=579351" title="Time in the United States">
<text>In the United States, time is divided into nine standard time zones covering the states, territories and other US possessions, with most of the country observing daylight saving time (DST) for approximately the spring, summer, and fall months. The time zone boundaries and DST observance are regulated by the Department of Transportation, but no single map of those existed until the agency announced intentions to make one in September 2022. Official and highly precise timekeeping services (clocks) are provided by two federal agencies: the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (an agency of the Department of Commerce); and the United States Naval Observatory (USNO). The clocks run by these services are kept synchronized with each other as well as with those of other international timekeeping organizations.

It is the combination of the time zone and daylight saving rules, along with the timekeeping services, which determines the legal civil time for any U.S. location at any moment.

==History==
Before the adoption of four standard time zones for the continental United States, many towns and cities set their clocks to noon when the sun passed their local meridian, pre-corrected for the equation of time on the date of observation, to form local mean solar time. Noon occurred at different times but time differences between distant locations were barely noticeable prior to the 19th century because of long travel times and the lack of long-distance instant communications prior to the development of the telegraph.

The use of local solar time became increasingly awkward as railways and telecommunications improved. American railroads maintained many different time zones during the late 19th century. Each train station set its own clock making it difficult to coordinate train schedules and confusing passengers. Time calculation became a serious problem for people traveling by train (sometimes hundreds of miles in a day), according to the Library of Congress. Train drivers had to recalculate their own clocks in order to know departure time. Every city in the United States used a different time standard so there were more than 300 local sun times to choose from. Time zones were therefore a compromise, relaxing the complex geographic dependence while still allowing local time to be approximate with mean solar time. Railroad managers tried to address the problem by establishing 100 railroad time zones, but this was only a partial solution to the problem.

Weather service chief Cleveland Abbe introduced four standard time zones for his weather stations, an idea which he offered to the railroads. Operators of the new railroad lines needed a new time plan that would offer a uniform train schedule for departures and arrivals. Four standard time zones for the continental United States were introduced at noon on November 18, 1883, in Chicago, Illinois, when the telegraph lines transmitted time signals to all major cities.

In October 1884, the International Meridian Conference at Washington, D.C., decided that the prime meridian for longitude and timekeeping should be one that passes through the center of the transit instrument at the Greenwich Observatory in the United Kingdom. The conference therefore established the Greenwich Meridian as the prime meridian and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) as the world&#x27;s time standard. The U.S. time-zone system grew from this, in which all zones referred back to GMT on the prime meridian.

===From GMT to UTC===
In 1960, the International Radio Consultative Committee formalized the concept of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which became the new international civil time standard. UTC is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0°. UTC does not observe daylight saving time.

For most purposes, UTC is considered interchangeable with GMT, but GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community. UTC is one of several closely related successors to GMT.

==United States and regional time zones==
Standard time zones in the United States and other regions are currently defined at the federal level by statute . The federal law also establishes the transition dates and times at which daylight saving time occurs, with federal law making its observation dependent on state or tribal law. It is ultimately the authority of the secretary of transportation, in coordination with the states, to determine which regions will observe which of the standard time zones and if they will observe daylight saving time. As of August 9, 2007, the standard time zones are defined in terms of hourly offsets from UTC. Prior to this they were based upon the mean solar time at several meridians 15° apart west of Greenwich (GMT).

Only the full-time zone names listed below are official; abbreviations are by common use conventions, and duplicated elsewhere in the world for different time zones.

===Zones used in the contiguous U.S.===

From east to west, the four time zones of the contiguous United States are:
* Eastern Time Zone (Zone R), which comprises roughly the states on the Atlantic coast and the eastern two thirds of the Ohio Valley.
* Central Time Zone (Zone S), which comprises roughly the Gulf Coast, Mississippi Valley, and most of the Great Plains.
* Mountain Time Zone (Zone T), which comprises roughly the states and portions of states that include the Rocky Mountains and the western quarter of the Great Plains.
* Pacific Time Zone (Zone U), which comprises roughly the states on the Pacific coast, plus Nevada and the Idaho Panhandle.

===Zones used in states beyond the contiguous U.S.===
* Alaska Time Zone (UTC−09:00; Zone V), which comprises most of the state of Alaska.
* Hawaii–Aleutian Time Zone (no daylight saving in Hawaii, UTC−10:00; zone W), which includes Hawaii and most of the length of the Aleutian Islands chain (west of 169°30′W).

===Zones used in U.S. territories===
* Samoa Time Zone (UTC−11:00; Zone X), which comprises American Samoa.
* Chamorro Time Zone (UTC+10:00; Zone K), which comprises Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
* Atlantic Time Zone (UTC−04:00; Zone Q), which comprises Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

===Minor Outlying Islands===
Some United States Minor Outlying Islands are outside the time zones defined by 15 U.S.C. §260 and exist in waters defined by nautical time. In practice, military crews may simply use Zulu time (UTC+00:00) when on these islands. Baker Island and Howland Island are in UTC−12:00, while Wake Island is in UTC+12:00. Because they exist on opposite sides of the International Date Line, it can, for example, be noon Thursday on Baker and Howland islands while simultaneously being noon Friday on Wake Island. Other outlying islands include Jarvis Island, Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, and Kingman Reef (UTC−11:00); Johnston Atoll (UTC−10:00); and Navassa Island, Bajo Nuevo Bank, and Serranilla Bank (UTC−05:00).

===Antarctic research stations===

In Antarctica, the U.S. research facility Palmer Station is in UTC−03:00, while McMurdo Station and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station use UTC+12:00 in order to coordinate with their main supply base in New Zealand.

==Boundaries between the zones==
(Described from north to south along each boundary.)

===Eastern–Central boundary===
* roughly follows the border between Wisconsin (to the south and west) and the Upper Peninsula (U.P.) of Michigan (to the north and east); the Upper Peninsula counties that border Wisconsin (namely Gogebic, Iron, Dickinson, and Menominee counties) observe central time, all other counties in the U.P. observe eastern time
* follows Lake Michigan
* divides a small portion of Northwestern Indiana near Chicago from the rest of the state
* follows the border between Central Illinois (west) and Central Indiana (east), with parts of the central time zone extending into northern and southern Indiana.
* divides a small portion of Southwestern Indiana from the rest of the state
* divides Kentucky in half roughly along a line that is west of Louisville, Kentucky running from northwest to southeast.
* divides the region legally defined as East Tennessee, except for four counties adjoining Middle Tennessee, from the rest of Tennessee.
* follows the border between Alabama (west) and Georgia (east), although Phenix City, Alabama and some nearby towns unofficially observe eastern time.
* divides the Florida Panhandle along the Apalachicola River and Intracoastal Waterway just west of Tallahassee, Florida.

===Central–Mountain boundary===
* divides the southwest portion of North Dakota from the rest of the state
* divides South Dakota roughly in half
* divides the western third of Nebraska from the rest of the state
* divides a very small portion of extreme western Kansas bordering Colorado (Greeley, Hamilton, Sherman, and Wallace counties) from the rest of the state (three other counties which border Colorado—Cheyenne, Morton, and Stanton counties—observe central time)
* follows the border between New Mexico (west) and Oklahoma (east) (although the zone legally begins at the Oklahoma–New Mexico state line, Kenton in extreme northwestern Cimarron County, Oklahoma unofficially observes mountain time)
* follows the border between New Mexico (west) and Texas (east)
* divides El Paso County, Hudspeth County, and a portion of northwestern Culberson County that includes eastern Guadalupe Mountains National Park from the rest of Texas

===Mountain–Pacific boundary===
* follows the border between northern Idaho (to the west) and northwestern Montana (to the east)
* turns west at (just south of Nez Perce Pass), and follows the Idaho County line to the Salmon River
* follows the Salmon River west to the town of Riggins, where the Salmon River turns north. This puts almost all of northern Idaho in the Pacific time zone, except for the small loop described next.
* turns north and follows the Salmon River to the Snake River at the Oregon border (at ). This loop to the north creates a curious situation where one can enter a more westerly time zone by traveling &quot;east&quot; over one of the six bridges across this portion of the Salmon River.
* turns south and follows the Snake River between Oregon (west) and Idaho (east) to the northern border of Malheur County, Oregon
* turns west and follows the northern border of Malheur County, Oregon to its western border, where it turns south
* follows the western border of Malheur County to latitude 42.45° (42°27′ N), where it turns east, and returns to the Oregon/Idaho border
* turns south and follows the border between Oregon (west) and Idaho (east)
* turns east and follows the border between Idaho (north) and Nevada (south) along the 42nd parallel north to longitude 114.041726 W.
* turns south and follows the border between Nevada (west) and Utah (east), except for following the west city limit line of West Wendover dividing it from the rest of Nevada, and putting it in the mountain time zone. Jackpot, Nevada, just south of the 42nd parallel and some west of the time zone south turn, also observes mountain time, on an unofficial basis.
* follows the border between Nevada (west) and Arizona (east)
* follows the border between California (west) and Arizona (east), mostly defined by the Colorado River, to the border between the U.S. and Mexico.

==Daylight saving time (DST)==
Daylight saving time (DST) begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November.

Clocks are set ahead one hour at 2:00 a.m. on the following start dates and set back one hour at 2:00 a.m. on the corresponding end dates:

In response to the Uniform Time Act of 1966, each state has officially chosen to apply one of two rules over its entire territory:
* Most use the standard time for their zone (or zones, where a state is divided between two zones), except for using daylight saving time during the summer months. Originally this ran from the last Sunday in April until the last Sunday in October. Two subsequent amendments, in 1986 and 2005, have shifted these days so that daylight saving time now runs from the second Sunday in March until the first Sunday in November. 
*Arizona and Hawaii use standard time throughout the year. However:
**The Navajo Nation observes DST throughout its entire territory, including the portion that lies in Arizona. But the Hopi Nation, which is entirely surrounded by the Navajo Nation and is entirely in Arizona, does &quot;not&quot; observe DST. (See map inset right.)
* In 2005, Indiana passed legislation that took effect on April 2, 2006, that placed the entire state on daylight saving time (see Time in Indiana). Before then, Indiana officially used standard time year-round, with the following exceptions:
**The portions of Indiana that were on Central Time observed daylight saving time.
**Some Indiana counties near Cincinnati and Louisville were on Eastern Time but did (unofficially) observe DST.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended daylight saving time for an additional month beginning in 2007.

The Sunshine Protection Act of 2021 passed the United States Senate in March 2022. The bill would make daylight saving time the time year-round in the entire United States. The bill was not voted on by the House of Representatives.

<text>Episodic memory is the memory of everyday events (such as times, location geography, associated emotions, and other contextual information) that can be explicitly stated or conjured. It is the collection of past personal experiences that occurred at particular times and places; for example, the party on one&#x27;s 7th birthday. Along with semantic memory, it comprises the category of explicit memory, one of the two major divisions of long-term memory (the other being implicit memory).

The term &quot;episodic memory&quot; was coined by Endel Tulving in 1972, referring to the distinction between knowing and remembering: &quot;knowing&quot; is factual recollection (semantic) whereas &quot;remembering&quot; is a feeling that is located in the past (episodic).

One of the main components of episodic memory is the process of recollection, which elicits the retrieval of contextual information pertaining to a specific event or experience that has occurred. Tulving seminally defined three key properties of episodic memory recollection as:
*A subjective sense of time (or mental time travel) 
*Connection to the self
*Autonoetic consciousness, a special kind of consciousness that accompanies the act of remembering, which enables an individual to be aware of the self in a subjective time
Aside from Tulving, others named additional aspects of recollection, including visual imagery, narrative structure, retrieval of semantic information and feelings of familiarity.

Events that are recorded into episodic memory may trigger episodic learning, i.e. a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event, such as a fear of dogs after being bitten by a dog.

== Nine properties ==
There are essentially nine properties of episodic memory that collectively distinguish it from other types of memory. Other types of memory may exhibit a few of these properties, but only episodic memory has all nine:

# Contain summary records of sensory-perceptual-conceptual-affective processing. 
# Retain patterns of activation/inhibition over long periods. 
# Often represented in the form of (visual) images. 
# They always have a perspective (field or observer).
# Represent short time slices of experience. 
# They are represented on a temporal dimension roughly in order of occurrence. 
# They are subject to rapid forgetting. 
# They make autobiographical remembering specific. 
# They are recollectively experienced when accessed.

==Cognitive neuroscience==
The formation of new episodic memories requires the medial temporal lobe, a structure that includes the hippocampus. Without the medial temporal lobe, one is able to form new procedural memories (such as playing the piano) but cannot remember the events during which they happened (See the hippocampus and memory).

The prefrontal cortex (and in particular the right hemisphere) is also involved in the formation of new episodic memories (also known as episodic encoding). Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex can learn new information, but tend to do so in a disordered fashion. For example, they might show normal recognition of an object they had seen in the past, but fail to recollect when or where it had been viewed. Some researchers believe that the prefrontal cortex helps organize information for more efficient storage, drawing upon its role in executive function. Others believe that the prefrontal cortex underlies semantic strategies which enhance encoding, such as thinking about the meaning of the study material or rehearsing it in working memory.

Other work has shown that portions of the inferior parietal lobe play a role in episodic memory, potentially acting as an accumulator to support the subjective feeling that something is &quot;old&quot;, or perhaps supporting mental imagery which allows you a sense of the vividness of memories. Indeed, bilateral damage to the inferior parietal lobe results in episodic memory that is largely intact, however it lacks details and lesion patients report low levels of confidence in their memories.

Researchers do not agree about how long episodic memories are stored in the hippocampus. Some researchers believe that episodic memories always rely on the hippocampus. Others believe the hippocampus only stores episodic memories for a short time, after which the memories are consolidated to the neocortex. The latter view is strengthened by recent evidence that neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus may ease the removal of old memories and increase the efficiency of forming new memories.

==Relationship to semantic memory==
Endel Tulving originally described episodic memory as a record of a person&#x27;s experience that held temporally dated information and spatio-temporal relations. A feature of episodic memory that Tulving later elaborates on is that it allows an agent to imagine traveling back in time. A current situation may cue retrieval of a previous episode, so that context that colours the previous episode is experienced at the immediate moment. The agent is provided with a means of associating previous feelings with current situations. Semantic memory, on the other hand, is a structured record of facts, concepts, and skills that we have acquired. Semantic information is derived from accumulated episodic memory. Episodic memory can be thought of as a &quot;map&quot; that ties together items in semantic memory. For example, all encounters with how a &quot;dog&quot; looks and sounds will make up the semantic representation of that word. All episodic memories concerning a dog will then reference this single semantic representation of &quot;dog&quot; and, likewise, all new experiences with the dog will modify the single semantic representation of that dog.

Together, semantic and episodic memory make up our declarative memory. They each represent different parts of context to form a complete picture. As such, something that affects episodic memory can also affect semantic memory. For example, anterograde amnesia, from damage of the medial temporal lobe, is an impairment of declarative memory that affects both episodic and semantic memory operations. Originally, Tulving proposed that episodic and semantic memory were separate systems that competed with each other in retrieval. However, this theory was rejected when Howard and Kahana completed experiments on latent semantic analysis (LSA) that supported the opposite. Instead of an increase in semantic similarity when there was a decrease in the strength of temporal associations, the two worked together so semantic cues on retrieval were strongest when episodic cues were strong as well.

==Age differences==

Episodic memory emerges at approximately 3 to 4 years of age. Activation of specific brain areas (mostly the hippocampus) seems to be different between younger (aged 23–39) and older people (aged 67–80) upon episodic memory retrieval. Older people tend to activate both their left and right hippocampus, while younger people activate only the left one.

==Relationship to emotion==
The relationship between emotion and memory is complex, but generally, emotion tends to increase the likelihood that an event will be remembered later and that it will be remembered vividly. Flashbulb memory is one example of this. Flashbulb memory is event-specific, which consists of depictions of personal experiences. For example, saying &quot;I remember seeing Grandma smile when I gave her the present&quot;, or remembering the detailed events of the tragedy of 9/11. This idea of flashbulb memory was proposed by R. Brown and Kulik (1977), in which they stated that this idea revolves around remembering an event or unexpected circumstance due to emotional arousal. They referred to this memory as &quot;photographic vividness&quot;. However, whether the vividness of the flashbulb memory is due to a virtual &quot;flash&quot; that occurs because of the emotional experience has been hotly contested. Flashbulb memories may occur because of our propensity to rehearse and retell those highly emotional events, which strengthens the memory. R. Brown and Kulik represented that these memories contain information that falls under the categories: place, ongoing activity, informant, own affect, and aftermath. Flashbulb memory is usually perceived as highly accurate and consistent over time and are presented with great confidence, even if sometimes they are inaccurate. Authors Brown, Kulik, and Conway argued that these special memories involve the limbic system, specifically, the amygdala. There is an abundancy of research that shows the amygdala involvement regarding retrieval of emotional memories, for example, research using brain imaging techniques.

==Pharmacological enhancement==
In healthy adults, longterm visual episodic memory can be enhanced specifically through administration of the Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor Donepezil, whereas verbal episodic memory can be improved in persons with the val/val genotype of the val158met polymorphism through administration of the CNS penetrant specific catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Tolcapone. Furthermore, episodic memory is enhanced through AZD3480, a selective agonist at the neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor, which is developed by the company Targacept. Currently, there are several other products developed by several companies—including new catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitors with fewer side effects—that aim for improving episodic memory. A recent placebo controlled study found that DHEA, which is a functional cortisol antagonist, improves episodic memory in healthy young men (Alhaj et al. 2006).

A 2015 meta-analysis of high quality evidence found that therapeutic doses of amphetamine and methylphenidate improve performance on working memory, episodic memory, and inhibitory control tests in normal healthy adults.

==Damage==
* Based on a review of behavioral studies, it is suggested that there may be selective damage to the limbic-prefrontal episodic memory system in some autistic people. Another study exhibited evidence of autistic deficits in the episodic or self-conscious memory of personally experienced events.
* The label &quot;amnesia&quot; is most often given to patients with deficits in episodic memory.
* Alzheimer&#x27;s disease tends to damage the entorhinal cortex  and the hippocampus before other brain areas and this leads to episodic memory loss 
* A rare type of shellfish poisoning called amnesic shellfish poisoning or &quot;ASP&quot; quite effectively and irreversibly damages the hippocampus, rendering one amnesic.
* Korsakoff&#x27;s syndrome is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, a form of malnutrition which can be precipitated by overconsumption of alcohol compared to foods.
* An acute cortisol level (by injection) has been found to significantly inhibit the recall of autobiographical memories which may contribute to memory deficits found in depression.
* The use of MDMA (&quot;Ecstasy&quot;) has been associated with persistent deficits in episodic memory.

==In animals==
Tulving (1983) proposed that to meet the criteria of episodic memory, evidence of conscious recollection must be provided. Demonstrating episodic memory in the absence of language, and thus in non-human animals, has been declared impossible as long as there are no agreed-upon non-linguistic behavioral indicators of conscious experience (Griffiths et al., 1999).
This idea was first challenged by Clayton and Dickinson in their work with the western scrub jay (&quot;Aphelocoma californica&quot;). They were able to demonstrate that these birds may possess an episodic-like memory system as they found that they remember where they cached different food types and discriminately recovered them depending on the perishability of the item and time that elapsed since caching. Thus, scrub-jays appear to remember the &quot;what-where-and-when&quot; of specific past caching events. The authors argued that such performance meets the behavioral criteria for episodic memory, but referred to the ability as &quot;episodic-like&quot; memory because the study did not address the phenomenological aspects of episodic memory.
According to a study conducted by the University of Edinburgh (2006), hummingbirds were the first animal to demonstrate two of the aspects of episodic memory—the ability to recall where certain flowers were located and how recently they were visited. Other studies have examined this type of memory in different animal species, such as dogs, rats, honey bees, and primates.

The ability of animals to encode and retrieve past experiences relies on the circuitry of the medial temporal lobe, a structure including the hippocampus. Animal lesion studies have provided significant findings related to the importance of particular brain structures in episodic-like memory. For example, hippocampal lesions have severely impacted all three components (what, where, and when) in animals, suggesting that the hippocampus is responsible for detecting novel events, stimuli, and places when forming new memories and retrieving that information later on.
Despite similar neural areas and evidence from experiments, some scholars remain cautious about comparisons to human episodic memory. Purported episodic-like memory often seems fixed to a particular domain or could be explained in terms of procedural or semantic memory. The problem may be better tractable by studying episodic memory&#x27;s adaptive counterpart: the capacity to flexibly imagine future events. However, a recent experiment addressed one of Suddendorf and Busby (2003)&#x27;s specific criticisms (the Bischof-Köhler hypothesis, which states that nonhuman animals can only take actions based on immediate needs, as opposed to future needs). Correia and colleagues demonstrated that western scrub-jays can selectively cache different types of foods depending on which type of food they will desire at a future time, offering strong evidence against the Bischof-Köhler hypothesis by demonstrating that scrub-jays can flexibly adjust their behavior based on past experience of desiring a particular food. Similarities and differences between humans and other animals are currently much debated.

==Autobiographical memory==
An autobiographical memory is a personal representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Additionally, it also refers to the memory of a person&#x27;s history. An individual does not remember exactly everything that has happened in one&#x27;s past. Memory is constructive, where previous experience affects how we remember events and what we end up recalling from memory. Similarly, autobiographical memory is constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person&#x27;s autobiographical memory is fairly reliable, although the reliability of autobiographical memories is questionable because of memory distortions.

Autobiographical memories can differ for special periods of life. For instance, people recall a few personal events from the first years of their lives. The loss of these first events is called childhood or infantile amnesia. Also, people tend to recall many personal events from adolescence and early adulthood. This effect is called the reminiscence bump. Additionally, people recall many personal events from their previous few years. For adolescents and young adults, the reminiscence bump and the recent events can coincide.

It is known that autobiographical memories initially are stored as episodic memories, but it is currently unknown if autobiographical memories are the same as episodic memories or if the autobiographical memories become converted to semantic memories with time.

== Types ==
* Specific events
** When you first set foot in the ocean.
* General events
** What it feels like stepping into the ocean in general. This is a memory of what a personal event is generally like. It might be based on the memories of having stepped in the ocean, many times during the years.
* Flashbulb memories
** Flashbulb memories are critical autobiographical memories about a major event.

==Neural network models==

Episodic memories can be stored in autoassociative neural networks (e.g., a Hopfield network) if the stored representation includes information on the spatiotemporal context in which an item was studied. Smaller memories such as words or references said by someone are labeled as inactive or active neurons in the entorhinal cortex.

Neural networks help us understand how the brain sends and receives different messages to the body, and how they are connected. These networks are a group of neurons or structures that are connected together. These structures work harmoniously to produce different cognitions within the brain. One of the largest proposals for this ideology is that of Diffusion Tensor Imaging. This technique traces the differing pathways of nerve fibres that further create communication throughout differing structures. These networks can be thought of as neural maps that can expand or contract according to the information being processed at that time. Neural Network Models can undergo learning patterns to use episodic memories to predict certain moments. Neural network models help the episodic memories by capturing the naturalistic state you are currently in such as scenery, rooms, time, smell, or even your current feeling.

<text>The Finn dinghy is a single-handed, cat-rigged sailboat, and a former Olympic class for men&#x27;s sailing. Since its debut at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Finn featured in every summer Olympics until 2020, making it the longest serving dinghy in the Olympic Regatta and one of the most prolific Olympic sailboats. The Finn is a physically demanding boat to race at the highest levels, especially since the class rules now allow unlimited boat rocking and sail pumping when the wind is above 10 knots. The event did not feature on the Olympic programme from 2024.

==Design==
The Finn was designed by Swedish canoe designer, Rickard Sarby, in 1949 for the Helsinki Olympics.

in 1952 the hulls were built of timber and the sails were of cotton. Initially there was little understanding of the role of a mast which could bend to reduce power. However over time the Finn sailors learned how to plane timber off the front of their masts for heavy winds and to glue on strips of timber on the front of the masts for lighter winds.

Although the Finn hull has changed little since then, there have been developments to the rig. The original spars were made of wood until the late 1960s and early 1970s, when there was a gradual change to aluminum masts. Aluminum masts are significantly more flexible and allow more control over sail shape, and became commonplace after the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich when they were first supplied to Olympic sailors. More recently, carbon fiber masts have become commonplace in competition Finns.

The sails, too, have evolved and are now commonly made of various laminates such as Technora, polyester, and Kevlar.

The class rules are overseen by the International Finn Association.

<doc id="579361" wikidata="Q631805" url="?curid=579361" title="Painted stork">
<text>The painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala) is a large wader in the stork family. It is found in the wetlands of the plains of tropical Asia south of the Himalayas in the Indian Subcontinent and extending into Southeast Asia. Their distinctive pink tertial feathers of the adults give them their name. They forage in flocks in shallow waters along rivers or lakes. They immerse their half open beaks in water and sweep them from side to side and snap up their prey of small fish that are sensed by touch. As they wade along they also stir the water with their feet to flush hiding fish. They nest colonially in trees, often along with other waterbirds. The only sounds they produce are weak moans or bill clattering at the nest. They are not migratory and only make short-distance movements in some parts of their range in response to changes in weather or food availability or for breeding. Like other storks, they are often seen soaring on thermals.

==Description==

This large stork has a heavy yellow beak with a down-curved tip that gives it a resemblance to an ibis. The head of the adult is bare and orange or reddish in colour. The long tertials are tipped in bright pink and at rest they extend over the back and rump. There is a distinctive black breast band with white scaly markings. The band continues into the under-wing coverts and the white tips of the black coverts give it the appearance of white stripes running across the under-wing lining.

The rest of the body is whitish in adults and the primaries and secondaries are black with a greenish gloss. The legs are yellowish to red but often appear white due their habit of urohidrosis or defecating on their legs especially when at rest. The short tail is black with a green gloss. For a stork, it is medium-sized, standing about tall, in wingspan and weighing . Males and females appear alike but the males of a pair are usually larger than the female.

The downy young are mainly whitish with grey bills and blackish facial skin. The juveniles assume a brownish plumage and like most other storks reach breeding condition after two to three years.

Like all storks, they fly with their neck outstretched. They often make use of the late morning thermals to soar in search of foraging areas. Like other storks they are mostly silent but clatter their bills at nest and may make some harsh croaking or low moaning sounds at nest.
==Taxonomy==
In the past the species has been placed in the genera &quot;Ibis&quot;, &quot;Tantalus&quot; and &quot;Pseudotantalus&quot;. The slight curve to the beak led them to be considered as a relative of the ibises. The older genus names were based on Greek mythology where Tantalus was punished by having to stand in a pool of water. T C Jerdon called it the &quot;Pelican Ibis&quot;. Later studies placed along with the wood-storks in the genus &quot;Mycteria,&quot; members of which have similar bill structure and share a common feeding behaviour of sweeping their half-open bill from side to side inside water as they wade and their evolutionary affinity has been confirmed by sequence based studies.

==Distribution and habitat==
The painted stork is widely distributed over the plains of Asia. They are found south of the Himalayan ranges and are bounded on the west by the Indus River system where they are rare and extend eastwards into Southeast Asia. They are absent from very dry or desert regions, dense forests and the higher hill regions. They are rare in most of Kerala and the species appears to have expanded into that region only in the 1990s. They prefer freshwater wetlands in all seasons, but also use irrigation canals and crop fields, particularly flooded rice fields during the monsoon. They are resident in most regions but make seasonal movements. Young birds may disperse far from their breeding sites as demonstrated by a juvenile ringed at a nest in Keoladeo National Park that was recovered 800 kilometres away at Chilka in eastern India. Breeding is always on large trees, usually in areas where nesting trees are secured over long periods of time, including in wetland reserves, along community-managed village ponds and lakes, inside villages when protection is also afforded to nesting birds like in Kokrebellur, protected tree patches in urban locations such as zoos, and on islands in urban wetlands.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Painted storks feed in groups in shallow wetlands, crop fields and irrigation canals. The maximum success of finding prey was at 7 cm of water depth at Keoladeo National Park. They feed mainly on small fish which they sense by touch while slowly sweeping their half open bill from side to side while it held submerged. They walk slowly and also disturb the water with their feet to flush fish. They also take frogs and the occasional snake. They forage mainly in the day but may forage late or even at night under exceptional conditions. After they are fed they may stand still on the shore for long durations. Painted storks in the Delhi region were observed eating fish, while those in Kokrebellur in south India fed nestlings with frogs, crabs, large insects and grasshoppers. Flock sizes in agricultural landscapes are mostly small (&lt;5 birds) but reach flocks of over 50 birds. In such landscapes, flock sizes do not vary much between seasons, but densities are much higher in winter after chicks of the year have fledged from nests.

Painted storks breed on trees either in mixed colonies along with other water birds, or by themselves. The breeding season begins in the winter months shortly after the monsoons. In northern India, the breeding season begins in mid-August while in southern India the nest initiation begins around October and continues till February and or even until April. One detailed study in Bengaluru city saw storks building nests between early February and mid-March, with all of the observed nests having fledgelings by mid-May. Considerable variation is noticed in the onset of breeding across sites with the season at Kokrebellur and Edurupattu around January or February but at Telineelapuram, Kundakulam and Tirunelveli the breeding begins around October or November.

The typical clutch varies from one to five eggs with early breeders having larger clutches. The incubation period is about a month while the fledging period is nearly two months. There is occasional predation of chicks by migrant &quot;Aquila&quot; eagles, Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle, House Crows, and Black Kites. During the mid-day heat, adults will stand at the nest with wings outstretched to shade the chicks. They defecate on their legs which are highly vascularized in order to cool themselves. This behaviour known as urohidrosis increases with ambient temperature. To feed chicks, adults regurgitate fish that they have caught and these are typically smaller than long. Young chicks, when threatened, disgorge food and feign death by crumpling to the nest floor. The daily requirement for chicks has been estimated to be made up of about 9 fish fed in two sessions. Nest survival (measured as daily nest survival) is higher for nests initiated early in the monsoon season, lower with decreasing temperature, and higher at larger colonies.
The bare red skin on the head is developed when reaching breeding maturity and involves the loss of feathers and the deposition of lipids under the skin. Birds in captivity have been known to live for as long as 28 years. Birds raised as chicks have been known to be tame and docile, even responding to their names when called.

A bird louse, &quot;Ardeicola tantali&quot; was described on the basis of a specimen obtained from this species as also a subcutaneous mite, &quot;Neottialges kutzeri&quot;, of the family Hypoderidae.
==Conservation==
Painted stork nesting colonies often become centres of tourist attraction due to their large size and colour. Particularly well-known nest sites close to human settlements are in the south Indian villages of Kokrebellur and Veerapura. In Kokrebellur, the birds nest within the trees in the village forming mixed nesting colonies with the spot-billed pelican. The local people provide security to these birds during the brief nesting season when the birds arrive in October and until they leave the village after a couple of months.
Another well-known colony that has been studied since the 1960s is the one inside the Delhi Zoological Park where the birds arrive about 30–40 days after the onset of the monsoons in Delhi. This colony is made up of 300 to 600 wild birds that make use of the trees within the artificial islands inside the zoo. Another colony of 26-96 nests is known from the Sultanpur National Park in Haryana, India where years with increased rainfall see more storks nesting. The largest north-Indian breeding population is known from Keoladeo-Ghana National Park that is estimated to have 2,500 nests. Uppalapadu village near Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, Kolleru, Gowtavaram Village in Andhra Pradesh and Ranganathittu are among the many other breeding colonies known from southern India. Captive birds are known to breed readily when provided with nesting materials and platforms. The largest secure population is found in India. Birds in Pakistan along the Indus River system are endangered and chicks at their nests are taken away for the bird trade. The species was nearly decimated in Thailand while small populations are known from Cambodia and Vietnam. Painted Storks taken from Sri Lanka were kept in captivity and subsequently released in Malaysia where the annual growth of the population is 10-13%.

There are some concerns for the closely related milky stork owing to hybridization with the painted stork, particularly in zoos. Hybrids have been recorded in the wild in Cambodia and in several zoos including those at Kuala Lumpur, Singapore Zoo and Bangkok. Hybridization with lesser adjutant storks have also been recorded in several zoos, especially at the Colombo Zoo, Sri Lanka where a male painted stork and female lesser adjutant mated and reared chicks several times.

<doc id="579364" wikidata="Q235657" url="?curid=579364" title="Maria of Portugal, Queen of Castile">
<text>Maria of Portugal () (9 February 1313 – 18 January 1357) was a Portuguese princess who became Queen of Castile upon her marriage to Alfonso XI in 1328. She was the eldest daughter of King Afonso IV of Portugal and his wife Beatrice of Castile.

== Life ==
In 1328, Maria married Alfonso XI of Castile. As part of the dower, King Alfonso gave her Guadalajara, Talavera de la Reina and Olmedo.

The relationship between Maria and Alfonso was unhappy: Alfonso had a relationship with Leonor de Guzmán who gave him ten children, including the future King Henry II of Castile. Maria did not participate in the affairs of the court, being replaced by the royal mistress, and it is quite likely that she spent long periods secluded at the Royal Monastery of San Clemente in Seville.

In 1335, Maria returned to her father in Évora, who demanded that Alfonso separated from Leonor. In the peace treaty of Seville in July 1340, Alfonso agreed to have Leonor sent to a convent, thereby securing the support of the King of Portugal in the Battle of Río Salado which was fought on 30 October 1340, although, once the military conflict had been resolved, he returned to his mistress and did not fulfill the promise he had made to the Portuguese monarch.

At Alfonso&#x27;s death, on 26 March 1350, Maria secured a power position by exerting influence upon the leader of her son&#x27;s council, João Afonso de Albuquerque. She ordered the murder of her husband&#x27;s mistress, Leonor de Guzmán, in the spring of 1351 in Talavera de la Reina. Maria also participated in the rebellion against her son in 1354. On 16 January 1356, when she was in the Alcázar of Toro, King Peter, accompanied by several squires, entered the place and ordered the killing of several nobles who accompanied the Queen, including her &quot;mayordomo&quot; Martim Afonso Telo de Meneses. After this, she returned to Portugal.

== Death and Burial ==
Maria had executed a will in Valladolid on 8 November 1351 in which she asked to be buried at the Royal Chapel of the Cathedral of Seville where her husband Alfonso XI had been buried and that, if his remains were transferred to another church, hers should also be transferred and buried alongside her husband.

She died in Évora on 18 January 1357 and was buried there until, against the wishes expressed in her will, her remains were transferred to the Royal Monastery of San Clemente in Seville. In 1371, King Henry II had ordered that his father, King Alfonso XI, should receive burial at the Royal Collegiate Church of Saint Hippolytus in Córdoba and at the same time, he probably decided that Maria, who had been responsible for his mother&#x27;s death, should be buried at the Royal Monastery of San Clemente in Seville. The gravestone made of simple tiles at the monastery mentions that she is buried there with two &quot;tender infants&quot;.

== Children ==

* Two sons buried with their mother in the Royal Monastery of San Clemente in Seville. One of them, the firstborn Fernando, died a few months after birth.
* Peter of Castile (1334–1369), King of Castile and León at the death of his father in 1350. He married Maria de Padilla, Blanche of Bourbon and Juana de Castro. His remains lie today in the crypt of the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Seville.

<text>Yun Sŏndo (; 1587–1671), also spelled as Yoon Sun-Do, was a Korean philosopher, poet, and politician. A Neo-Confucian scholar, he was also known by his art names Gosan and Haeong.

==Life==
He was born in Seoul, Joseon. He achieved early success as a government official, but his straightforward character made enemies at court and he was banished for imprudent criticism of those in power. Thirteen years later he returned to become tutor to the royal princes but was later banished again. He spent most of his 85 years in his rustic country home, contemplating the nature of life, teaching and writing poetry.

Yun is considered the greatest master of the sijo form in Korean literature. His most famous composition is &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Calendar&quot; (어부사시사, 1651) a cycle of forty seasonal sijo. In both Chinese and Korean classical poetry, the fisherman symbolized a wise man who lives simply and naturally. In art, the fisherman appeared almost invariably in one of the most common genres of Asian water colors: sets of four paintings, one for each season of the year.

Yun Sŏndo wove both traditions into &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Calendar&quot;. It is the longest and most ambitious sijo cycle attempted during the classical period of his life.

Some lines are given below from a translation of the Autumn section by Gross.A fisherman&#x27;s life is idyllic, away from cares of the world...

Do not mock the old fisherman, you&#x27;ll see him in every painting.

I look back on the world of men, the farther off the better. 
And from &quot;Five Friends&quot;.
Moon, you watch but keep silent; isn&#x27;t that what a good friend does?

<doc id="579381" wikidata="Q296112" url="?curid=579381" title="Karl Shuker">
<text>Karl Shuker (born 9 December 1959) is a British zoologist, cryptozoologist and author. He lives in the Midlands, England, where he works as a zoological consultant and writer. A columnist in &quot;Fortean Times&quot; and contributor to various magazines, Shuker is also the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Journal of Cryptozoology&quot;, which began in November 2012.

==Career==
Shuker received a BSc (Hons) in zoology from the University of Leeds and a PhD in zoology and comparative physiology from the University of Birmingham.
He is a Scientific Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society, a consultant for the Centre for Fortean Zoology, and a member of the Society of Authors.

Some of his larger works include &quot;Mystery Cats of the World&quot; (1989), &quot;The Lost Ark: New and Rediscovered Animals of the 20th Century&quot; (1993; expanded in 2002 as &quot;The New Zoo&quot;), and &quot;In Search of Prehistoric Survivors&quot; (1995), as well as two worldwide bestsellers – &quot;Dragons: A Natural History&quot; (1995; reissued in 2006), and &quot;The Unexplained&quot; (1996; reissued in 2002). Shuker also published &quot;Star Steeds and Other Dreams&quot;, a book of poetry which appeared in 2009.

According to Jonathan Downes, there are a number of little-known cryptids to which Shuker was the first cryptozoologist to bring widespread public attention. These include the Sri Lankan horned jackal and Devil Bird, Gambo the Gambian sea serpent, Goodenough Island mystery bird, New Guinea ropen and devil pig or gazeka, Scottish earth hound, Indonesian veo and horned cat, New Caledonian du, Irish dobhar-chú, Shatt al Arab venomous mystery fish, Zanzibar makalala, Ethiopian death bird, Zululand kondlo, Arctic North American waheela, Kellas cat, Mongolian Death Worm, Hungarian reedwolf, Fujian blue or Maltese tiger as shown on the cover of &quot;Mysteries of Planet Earth&quot; (1999), Welsh cenaprugwirion, bigfin squid, St Helena sirenian, Timor Sea ground shark, and crowing crested cobra.

Shuker pens two cryptozoological columns (&quot;Alien Zoo&quot; and &quot;The Lost Ark&quot;) in &quot;Fortean Times&quot;, and contributes regularly to &quot;Strange Magazine&quot;, to &quot;Fate Magazine&quot;, and to &quot;Paranormal Magazine&quot;. In addition, he is the zoological consultant for &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

In a 2012 interview, Shuker stated that three of the most important zoological discoveries of the twentieth century were the okapi, the coelacanth and the saola (or Vu Quang ox). Shuker&#x27;s 2012 volume, &quot;The Encyclopaedia of New and Rediscovered Animals&quot; provides a detailed discussion of similar discoveries, including discoveries made as recently as 2011.

In November 2012, Shuker launched the &quot;Journal of Cryptozoology&quot;. As the journal&#x27;s founding editor-in-chief, Shuker has the stated goal of &quot;providing an outlet for cryptozoological research with a genuinely scientific approach,&quot; with the hope of elevating the field&#x27;s reputation among the scientific community. Upon announcing plans to start the new journal, Shuker had expressed &quot;hope that cryptozoological researchers will submit papers to the journal that are totally worthy of publication in mainstream zoological journals but which may not be accepted by them simply because their subject is cryptozoological.&quot; Remarking that many newly discovered or rediscovered species begin as cryptids, Shuker believes that the field of cryptozoology is at a disadvantage, noting &quot;as soon as one of its subjects is confirmed to be real, it is no longer cryptozoological but zoological instead.&quot;

==Scientific approach==

Shuker engages in what he describes as the scientific investigation of &quot;animals still awaiting formal zoological detection and description in the 21st century.&quot; However, Shuker is critical of investigators who set out to uncritically validate their preconceptions, stating that such activity is not serious cryptozoology.

Shuker&#x27;s approach also sometimes leads to a more reserved position regarding cryptid claims. Having investigated the mystery of the chupacabra, Shuker noted in an interview with Benjamin Radford that the inconsistencies surrounding descriptions and accounts of the creature made it difficult to separate actual reports from folklore.

Based on his interpretation of available accounts and evidence of the creature, Shuker hypothesized that the chupacabra itself might be &quot;a nonexistent composite&quot; resulting from accounts of &quot;different entities [...] all being lumped together.&quot;

==Critical reception==
In a 1996 review of Shuker&#x27;s book &quot;Dragons: A Natural History&quot; in &quot;Natural History&quot;, Richard Ellis discussed the &quot;impressive assortment of illustrations,&quot; as well as Shuker&#x27;s coverage of dragon imagery and icons throughout history, but criticized a lack of focus on &quot;the &#x27;real&#x27; animals held to be responsible for some of the dragon or sea serpent stories, such as the crocodile, the Komodo dragon, the African rock python, and the oarfish.&quot; Ellis found fault with coverage of &quot;aquatic serpent dragons&quot; such as the Loch Ness monster, lamenting that &quot;despite corroborated evidence that the famous Loch Ness monster&#x27;s &#x27;surgeon&#x27;s photograph&#x27; was a hoax, [...] &#x27;Nessie&#x27; is one of the contemporary &#x27;dragons&#x27; in this book.&quot;

In June 1997 Shuker criticized &quot;Fortean Times&quot; publisher Mike Dash, who has described most reports of strange phenomena to be products of the imagination, to which Shuker stated, &quot;there are some intriguing pieces of evidence for the existence of a large underwater mammal in Loch Ness, not least the sonar soundings of 1972 which showed the presence of a 6-ft flipper.&quot; However, in a 1998 &quot;Sunday Times&quot; interview, Shuker suggested that the Loch Ness monster was losing traction, with more attention going toward large cat sightings, stating, &quot;They&#x27;re more tangible,&quot; and that &quot;[a]ny scientist who these days decides to take the Loch Ness monster seriously knows that it will damage his reputation.&quot;

Reviewing Shuker&#x27;s 2003 book &quot;The Beasts that Hide from Man&quot;, Mark Bayless described the work as &quot;thought provoking and well researched,&quot; contrasting Shuker&#x27;s work favorably against other cryptozoology texts as providing a &quot;scholarly, reader-friendly format,&quot; and addressing a wider range of cryptids that are not covered in comparable sources.

A March 2013 review of the &quot;Journal of Cryptozoology&quot; in Brazilian journal &quot;Revista Piauí&quot; was generally positive regarding Shuker&#x27;s efforts at a scientific approach to documenting cryptozoological findings, noting an article which put forth a giant oarfish as the most likely candidate to explain a recent sighting, but noted the professional challenges that cryptozoological researchers seeking to document findings may face, suggesting some are met with ridicule from colleagues due to a large portion of the cryptozoological community not being scientifically regarded.

==Awards and honours==
In 2005, a new species of Loricifera was named &quot;Pliciloricus shukeri&quot;, after Shuker.

In November 2001, Karl Shuker won £250,000 on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;.

<text>The Merrie Monarch Festival is a week-long cultural festival that takes place annually in Hilo, Hawaii during the week after Easter. It honors King David Kalākaua, who was called the &quot;Merrie Monarch&quot; for his patronage of the arts and is credited with restoring many Hawaiian cultural traditions during his reign, including hula. Many &quot;hālau hula&quot; (schools), including some from the U.S. mainland and some international performers, attend the festival each year to participate in exhibitions and competitions. The festival has received worldwide attention and is considered the most prestigious of all hula contests.

Merrie Monarch week begins Easter Sunday every year. The competitive hula events end the week, and occur on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday; They are televised and live-streamed for free online by &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot; (formerly KHII-TV, KFVE/K5).

The 2020 Merrie Monarch festival was cancelled due to coronavirus pandemic concerns. The 2021 competition was held June 24–26, without a live audience, and was broadcast July 1–3 on KFVE.

The 2023 Merrie Monarch hula competition began on April 13, 2023 at 6:00pm HST, and was livestreamed free all three nights on the website of &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot;.

== History ==
The festival is dedicated to the memory of King David Kalākaua, the last king of the Kingdom of Hawaii, who reigned from 1874 until his death in 1891. Kalākaua was “a patron of the arts, especially music and dance,” and is credited with reviving many endangered native Hawaiian traditions such as mythology, medicine, and chant. He was also a strong supporter of the hula, a traditional form of dance. Many of these cultural practices &quot;had been suppressed for many years under missionary teachings.&quot; The festival is named after Kalākaua&#x27;s nickname “Merrie Monarch” because he was known to always be happy, fun, and loving towards his people. The structure of the festival takes after Kalākaua&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. This was a two-week celebration of Hawaiian culture on his 50th birthday (1886) at ʻIolani Palace on the island of Oʻahu.

The Merrie Monarch Festival began in 1963 when Helene Hale, then Executive Officer of Hawaii County, decided to create an event to increase tourism to the Island of Hawaii. The island had suffered from economic problems after the collapse of the sugar industry, and it was hoped that a festival would boost the depressed economy. Along with George Naʻope and Gene Wilhelm, Hale organized the first Merrie Monarch Festival in 1964. This festival “consisted of a King Kalākaua beard look–alike contest, a barbershop quartet contest, a relay race, a re–creation of King Kalākaua&#x27;s coronation, and a Holoku Ball among other events.”
George Naʻope was a well known Kumu Hula (teacher of Hawaiian dance) throughout the whole world. He studied hula from his great grandmother since he was three years old and established his own hula school, the George Naʻope Hula School, shortly after graduating high school. He taught hula in Japan, Guam, Australia, Germany, England, and both North and South America. His purpose in life was to preserve the Hawaiian culture, and he thought the festival was a perfect way of allowing the culture live on.

By 1968, the festival had waned in popularity. Dottie Thompson took over the festival as executive director, and transformed it into a private community organization. Thompson “wanted to move the festival more toward a Hawaiian theme,” a goal that was accomplished by centering the festival events around hula. In 1971 Thompson and Na’ope introduced a hula competition. Nine wahine (female) hālau entered the competition in its first year, and in 1976 the festival opened the competition to kāne (male) hālau.

Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival is an annual week–long event culminating in three days of prestigious hula competition. It is now a non–profit organization registered with the State of Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. Proceeds from the festival support educational scholarships, workshops, seminars, symposiums and the continuation of the event itself.

==Festival activities==
The Merrie Monarch Festival occurs annually in the spring. It runs from Easter Sunday morning to Saturday evening.

===The Royal Court===
For the festival, a Royal Court is created to represent King David Kalākaua and Queen Kapiʻolani and their family. The Royal Court is coordinated by Uʻilani Peralto and Luana Kawelu, who each year search for a male and female to portray the king and queen. Peralto says, “the selection committee looks to find two individuals who exemplify maturity, humility, and pride in the Hawaiian culture.” The court consists of 22 members total, typically represented by the friends and family of the chosen king and queen. The rest of the royal court includes a counselor, kahu (caretaker), ladies-in-waiting, kahili bearers, chanters, and pu kane (conch shell blowers). Each person in the royal court is educated about their roles and Kalākaua&#x27;s mission. These people who make up the Royal Court represent more than just Hawaiian history, but the Hawaiian spirit that continuously flows throughout the islands. The procession of the Royal Court precedes and ends each night of the Merrie Monarch hula competition, and they sit in state during the performances.

===Non-competition events===

The first four days of the festival consist of free, non–competition events. These include performances by local and international halau at many venues around Hilo, as well as an arts and crafts fair. The Wednesday Ho&#x27;ike Night Free exhibition is very popular, and often features international hālau from other Pacific islands and Japan, and native or indigenous dancers and dances from locations such as Alaska and New Zealand. A final non–competition event, the Merrie Monarch Parade, takes place on Saturday morning.

===Hula competition===

The festivities culminate in the annual competitions held at the Edith Kanakaʻole Multipurpose Stadium in Hoʻolulu Park. Dancers perform individually and in groups, with seven minutes allowed for each performance.

====Miss Aloha Hula====
Thursday night is the first competition event. Individual female dancers compete for the title of Miss Aloha Hula. Dancers perform in both modern (hula ʻauana) and traditional (hula kahiko) forms of hula, as well as chant (oli).

Miss Aloha Hula is hula&#x27;s top solo wahine, or women&#x27;s, honor. Originally known as Miss Hula, the title was later changed to Miss Aloha Hula. Aloha Dalire, a kumu hula and hula dancer, won the first Miss Aloha Hula under her maiden name, Aloha Wong, in 1971.

The Miss Aloha Hula competition began in 1971. Each hālau may submit one contestant who is 18 to 25 years old and unmarried. Each contestant performs a hula kahiko and hula &#x27;auana. For kahiko, they must perform an oli, ka&#x27;i, mele, and ho&#x27;i in the 7 minute time limit. No microphones are used for the oli and minimal makeup is applied. They are also judged on their costuming and leis.

====Group hula kahiko====

There are two divisions of group competition, the male (kāne) division and the female (wahine) division. 
Friday night features hālau performing ancient style hula.

====Group hula ʻauana====

Saturday night features hālau performing modern style hula. Awards are also announced on Saturday night.

====Judging criteria====

During their performances hālau and individuals are judged in a variety of categories. First, there is the entrance (kaʻi). During their chant (oli) and dance (hula), judges look for interpretation of the song being performed, expression of the hula, chant, or song, posture, precision, hand gestures, feet and body movement, grooming, and authenticity of costume and adornments. Finally there is the exit off stage (hoʻi). Performers are scored on each aspect of the performance.

==Cultural impact==
Many believe that the Merrie Monarch Festival “brought about a renaissance of Hawaiian culture.” The festival identifies four goals related to Hawaiian culture: “1) Perpetuating the traditional culture of the Hawaiian people; 2) Developing and augmenting a living knowledge of Hawaiian arts and crafts through workshops, demonstrations, exhibitions and performances of the highest quality and authenticity; 3) Reaching those who might not otherwise have the opportunity to participate; and, 4) Enriching the future lives of all of Hawaii&#x27;s children,” and claims that through the festival “thousands of people in Hawaii and throughout the world are learning about the history and culture of Hawaii.” 
The Merrie Monarch Festival “has received worldwide recognition for its historic and cultural significance.” 

==Television coverage and web livestream==

The festival was first broadcast on local TV in 1981, when KITV brought the festival to homes across Hawaii. Coverage began as taped and edited highlight segments and eventually went live. KITV broadcast the festival for 29 years; in 2009, Luana Kawelu, who had recently taken over the job of president of the Merrie Monarch Festival, signed a deal with competitor KFVE to broadcast the festival in 2010 and beyond.

The hula competition is livestreamed for free all three nights on the website of &quot;Hawaii News Now&quot;, so that persons not living in Hawaii may enjoy it.

== Nā Hiwahiwa O Hawai&#x27;i festival, Japan ==
For some hālau, the festival does not end after the competition is over. Those who place in the competition are then invited to attend the Nā Hiwahiwa Festival in Tokyo, Japan. This festival includes Merrie Monarch Festival winners and Nā Hōku Hanohano winners. This festival is a celebration of the Hawaiian dancers and singers who received award-winning recognition in these competitions. Japan is one of the biggest supporters in the world of hula and the Hawaiian culture. Japanese hula schools do not compete in the Merrie Monarch Festival, but most of the schools travel to Hilo every year to support the hula hālau and experience the festivities Merrie Monarch has to offer.

<text>In computational biology, gene prediction or gene finding refers to the process of identifying the regions of genomic DNA that encode genes. This includes protein-coding genes as well as RNA genes, but may also include prediction of other functional elements such as regulatory regions. Gene finding is one of the first and most important steps in understanding the genome of a species once it has been sequenced.

In its earliest days, &quot;gene finding&quot; was based on painstaking experimentation on living cells and organisms. Statistical analysis of the rates of homologous recombination of several different genes could determine their order on a certain chromosome, and information from many such experiments could be combined to create a genetic map specifying the rough location of known genes relative to each other. Today, with comprehensive genome sequence and powerful computational resources at the disposal of the research community, gene finding has been redefined as a largely computational problem.

Determining that a sequence is functional should be distinguished from determining the function of the gene or its product. Predicting the function of a gene and confirming that the gene prediction is accurate still demands &quot;in vivo&quot; experimentation through gene knockout and other assays, although frontiers of bioinformatics research are making it increasingly possible to predict the function of a gene based on its sequence alone.

Gene prediction is one of the key steps in genome annotation, following sequence assembly, the filtering of non-coding regions and repeat masking.

Gene prediction is closely related to the so-called &#x27;target search problem&#x27; investigating how DNA-binding proteins (transcription factors) locate specific binding sites within the genome. Many aspects of structural gene prediction are based on current understanding of underlying biochemical processes in the cell such as gene transcription, translation, protein–protein interactions and regulation processes, which are subject of active research in the various omics fields such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and more generally structural and functional genomics.

== Empirical methods ==
In empirical (similarity, homology or evidence-based) gene finding systems, the target genome is searched for sequences that are similar to extrinsic evidence in the form of the known expressed sequence tags, messenger RNA (mRNA), protein products, and homologous or orthologous sequences. Given an mRNA sequence, it is trivial to derive a unique genomic DNA sequence from which it had to have been transcribed. Given a protein sequence, a family of possible coding DNA sequences can be derived by reverse translation of the genetic code. Once candidate DNA sequences have been determined, it is a relatively straightforward algorithmic problem to efficiently search a target genome for matches, complete or partial, and exact or inexact. Given a sequence, local alignment algorithms such as BLAST, FASTA and Smith-Waterman look for regions of similarity between the target sequence and possible candidate matches. Matches can be complete or partial, and exact or inexact. The success of this approach is limited by the contents and accuracy of the sequence database.

A high degree of similarity to a known messenger RNA or protein product is strong evidence that a region of a target genome is a protein-coding gene. However, to apply this approach systemically requires extensive sequencing of mRNA and protein products. Not only is this expensive, but in complex organisms, only a subset of all genes in the organism&#x27;s genome are expressed at any given time, meaning that extrinsic evidence for many genes is not readily accessible in any single cell culture. Thus, to collect extrinsic evidence for most or all of the genes in a complex organism requires the study of many hundreds or thousands of cell types, which presents further difficulties. For example, some human genes may be expressed only during development as an embryo or fetus, which might be difficult to study for ethical reasons.

Despite these difficulties, extensive transcript and protein sequence databases have been generated for human as well as other important model organisms in biology, such as mice and yeast. For example, the RefSeq database contains transcript and protein sequence from many different species, and the Ensembl system comprehensively maps this evidence to human and several other genomes. It is, however, likely that these databases are both incomplete and contain small but significant amounts of erroneous data.

New high-throughput transcriptome sequencing technologies such as RNA-Seq and ChIP-sequencing open opportunities for incorporating additional extrinsic evidence into gene prediction and validation, and allow structurally rich and more accurate alternative to previous methods of measuring gene expression such as expressed sequence tag or DNA microarray.

Major challenges involved in gene prediction involve dealing with sequencing errors in raw DNA data, dependence on the quality of the sequence assembly, handling short reads, frameshift mutations, overlapping genes and incomplete genes.

In prokaryotes it&#x27;s essential to consider horizontal gene transfer when searching for gene sequence homology. An additional important factor underused in current gene detection tools is existence of gene clusters — operons (which are functioning units of DNA containing a cluster of genes under the control of a single promoter) in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Most popular gene detectors treat each gene in isolation, independent of others, which is not biologically accurate.

== &quot;Ab initio&quot; methods ==
Ab Initio gene prediction is an intrinsic method based on gene content and signal detection. Because of the inherent expense and difficulty in obtaining extrinsic evidence for many genes, it is also necessary to resort to &quot;ab initio&quot; gene finding, in which the genomic DNA sequence alone is systematically searched for certain tell-tale signs of protein-coding genes. These signs can be broadly categorized as either &quot;signals&quot;, specific sequences that indicate the presence of a gene nearby, or &quot;content&quot;, statistical properties of the protein-coding sequence itself. &quot;Ab initio&quot; gene finding might be more accurately characterized as gene &quot;prediction&quot;, since extrinsic evidence is generally required to conclusively establish that a putative gene is functional.

In the genomes of prokaryotes, genes have specific and relatively well-understood promoter sequences (signals), such as the Pribnow box and transcription factor binding sites, which are easy to systematically identify. Also, the sequence coding for a protein occurs as one contiguous open reading frame (ORF), which is typically many hundred or thousands of base pairs long. The statistics of stop codons are such that even finding an open reading frame of this length is a fairly informative sign. (Since 3 of the 64 possible codons in the genetic code are stop codons, one would expect a stop codon approximately every 20–25 codons, or 60–75 base pairs, in a random sequence.) Furthermore, protein-coding DNA has certain periodicities and other statistical properties that are easy to detect in a sequence of this length. These characteristics make prokaryotic gene finding relatively straightforward, and well-designed systems are able to achieve high levels of accuracy.

&quot;Ab initio&quot; gene finding in eukaryotes, especially complex organisms like humans, is considerably more challenging for several reasons. First, the promoter and other regulatory signals in these genomes are more complex and less well-understood than in prokaryotes, making them more difficult to reliably recognize. Two classic examples of signals identified by eukaryotic gene finders are CpG islands and binding sites for a poly(A) tail.

Second, splicing mechanisms employed by eukaryotic cells mean that a particular protein-coding sequence in the genome is divided into several parts (exons), separated by non-coding sequences (introns). (Splice sites are themselves another signal that eukaryotic gene finders are often designed to identify.) A typical protein-coding gene in humans might be divided into a dozen exons, each less than two hundred base pairs in length, and some as short as twenty to thirty. It is therefore much more difficult to detect periodicities and other known content properties of protein-coding DNA in eukaryotes.

Advanced gene finders for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes typically use complex probabilistic models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to combine information from a variety of different signal and content measurements. The GLIMMER system is a widely used and highly accurate gene finder for prokaryotes. GeneMark is another popular approach. Eukaryotic &quot;ab initio&quot; gene finders, by comparison, have achieved only limited success; notable examples are the GENSCAN and geneid programs. The GeneMark-ES and SNAP gene finders are GHMM-based like GENSCAN. They attempt to address problems related to using a gene finder on a genome sequence that it was not trained against. A few recent approaches like mSplicer, CONTRAST, or mGene also use machine learning techniques like support vector machines for successful gene prediction. They build a discriminative model using hidden Markov support vector machines or conditional random fields to learn an accurate gene prediction scoring function.

&quot;Ab Initio&quot; methods have been benchmarked, with some approaching 100% sensitivity, however as the sensitivity increases, accuracy suffers as a result of increased false positives.

===Other signals===
Among the derived signals used for prediction are statistics resulting from the sub-sequence statistics like k-mer statistics, Isochore (genetics) or Compositional domain GC composition/uniformity/entropy, sequence and frame length, Intron/Exon/Donor/Acceptor/Promoter and Ribosomal binding site vocabulary, Fractal dimension, Fourier transform of a pseudo-number-coded DNA, Z-curve parameters and certain run features.

It has been suggested that signals other than those directly detectable in sequences may improve gene prediction. For example, the role of secondary structure in the identification of regulatory motifs has been reported. In addition, it has been suggested that RNA secondary structure prediction helps splice site prediction.

=== Neural networks ===

Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition. Neural networks must be trained with example data before being able to generalise for experimental data, and tested against benchmark data. Neural networks are able to come up with approximate solutions to problems that are hard to solve algorithmically, provided there is sufficient training data. When applied to gene prediction, neural networks can be used alongside other &quot;ab initio&quot; methods to predict or identify biological features such as splice sites. One approach involves using a sliding window, which traverses the sequence data in an overlapping manner. The output at each position is a score based on whether the network thinks the window contains a donor splice site or an acceptor splice site. Larger windows offer more accuracy but also require more computational power. A neural network is an example of a signal sensor as its goal is to identify a functional site in the genome.

== Combined approaches ==
Programs such as Maker combine extrinsic and &quot;ab initio&quot; approaches by mapping protein and EST data to the genome to validate &quot;ab initio&quot; predictions. Augustus, which may be used as part of the Maker pipeline, can also incorporate hints in the form of EST alignments or protein profiles to increase the accuracy of the gene prediction.

== Comparative genomics approaches ==
As the entire genomes of many different species are sequenced, a promising direction in current research on gene finding is a comparative genomics approach.

This is based on the principle that the forces of natural selection cause genes and other functional elements to undergo mutation at a slower rate than the rest of the genome, since mutations in functional elements are more likely to negatively impact the organism than mutations elsewhere. Genes can thus be detected by comparing the genomes of related species to detect this evolutionary pressure for conservation. This approach was first applied to the mouse and human genomes, using programs such as SLAM, SGP and TWINSCAN/N-SCAN and CONTRAST.

=== Multiple informants ===

TWINSCAN examined only human-mouse synteny to look for orthologous genes. Programs such as N-SCAN and CONTRAST allowed the incorporation of alignments from multiple organisms, or in the case of N-SCAN, a single alternate organism from the target. The use of multiple informants can lead to significant improvements in accuracy.

CONTRAST is composed of two elements. The first is a smaller classifier, identifying donor splice sites and acceptor splice sites as well as start and stop codons. The second element involves constructing a full model using machine learning. Breaking the problem into two means that smaller targeted data sets can be used to train the classifiers,
and that classifier can operate independently and be trained with smaller windows. The full model can use the independent classifier, and not have to waste computational time or model complexity re-classifying intron-exon boundaries. The paper in which CONTRAST is introduced proposes that their method (and those of TWINSCAN, etc.) be classified as &quot;de novo&quot; gene assembly, using alternate genomes, and identifying it as distinct from &quot;ab initio&quot;, which uses a target &#x27;informant&#x27; genomes.

Comparative gene finding can also be used to project high quality annotations from one genome to another. Notable examples include Projector, GeneWise, GeneMapper and GeMoMa. Such techniques now play a central role in the annotation of all genomes.

== Pseudogene prediction ==

Pseudogenes are close relatives of genes, sharing very high sequence homology, but being unable to code for the same protein product. Whilst once relegated as byproducts of gene sequencing, increasingly, as regulatory roles are being uncovered, they are becoming predictive targets in their own right. Pseudogene prediction utilises existing sequence similarity and ab initio methods, whilst adding additional filtering and methods of identifying pseudogene characteristics.

Sequence similarity methods can be customised for pseudogene prediction using additional filtering to find candidate pseudogenes. This could use disablement detection, which looks for nonsense or frameshift mutations that would truncate or collapse an otherwise functional coding sequence. Additionally, translating DNA into proteins sequences can be more effective than just straight DNA homology.

Content sensors can be filtered according to the differences in statistical properties between pseudogenes and genes, such as a reduced count of CpG islands in pseudogenes, or the differences in G-C content between pseudogenes and their neighbours. Signal sensors also can be honed to pseudogenes, looking for the absence of introns or polyadenine tails.
== Metagenomic gene prediction ==

Metagenomics is the study of genetic material recovered from the environment, resulting in sequence information from a pool of organisms. Predicting genes is useful for comparative metagenomics.

Metagenomics tools also fall into the basic categories of using either sequence similarity approaches (MEGAN4) and ab initio techniques (GLIMMER-MG).

Glimmer-MG is an extension to GLIMMER that relies mostly on an ab initio approach for gene finding and by using training sets from related organisms. The prediction strategy is augmented by classification and clustering gene data sets prior to applying ab initio gene prediction methods. The data is clustered by species. This classification method leverages techniques from metagenomic phylogenetic classification. An example of software for this purpose is, Phymm, which uses interpolated markov models—and PhymmBL, which integrates BLAST into the classification routines.

MEGAN4 uses a sequence similarity approach, using local alignment against databases of known sequences, but also attempts to classify using additional information on functional roles, biological pathways and enzymes. As in single organism gene prediction, sequence similarity approaches are limited by the size of the database.

FragGeneScan and MetaGeneAnnotator are popular gene prediction programs based on Hidden Markov model. These predictors account for sequencing errors, partial genes and work for short reads.

Another fast and accurate tool for gene prediction in metagenomes is MetaGeneMark. This tool is used by the DOE Joint Genome Institute to annotate IMG/M, the largest metagenome collection to date.

<doc id="579393" wikidata="Q1936265" url="?curid=579393" title="Misogi">
<text>is a Japanese Shinto practice of ritual purification by washing the entire body. Misogi is related to another Shinto purification ritual, &quot;harae&quot;. Thus, both are collectively referred to as .

==Background==
Every year, many people take pilgrimages to sacred waterfalls, lakes and rivers, either alone or in small groups, to perform misogi. Mount Ontake, the Kii mountain range and Mount Yoshino are but a few examples of ancient and well known areas for misogi in Japan. In Kyoto, people douse themselves under Kiyomizu Temple&#x27;s &quot;Otowa no taki&quot; (Sound-of-Wings) waterfall, although the majority of visitors drink from the waters rather than plunging into them. In the United States, misogi was performed at the Tsubaki Grand Shrine of America at the Konryu Myojin no Taki waterfall each morning in the years prior to its closure in 2023.

Before encountering misogi, members generally undergo some sort of preliminary purification. Such things as prayers, fasting, or some sort of physical activity is common. Generally, women put on a special white kimono and men put on a fundoshi (loincloth), with both genders also wearing headbands. They then begin or &quot;spirit shaking&quot; by clenching their hands in front of the stomach and shaking them up and down, vibrating the upper torso. The purpose of this is to become aware of/unified with the spirit&#x27;s presence within. Following this is a &quot;warm-up&quot; or calisthenics ( or &quot;bird boat&quot; rowing). These two aforementioned practices are sometimes accompanied by special prayers or incantations. After, the leader begins to speak out invocations/prayers that are said to activate the spirit. The followers generally speak along with them, thus affirming the potential for realizing one&#x27;s own spirit, and thus unifying them with the kami around them.
The above exercises make participants raise their metabolism, and some groups accompany that with deep breathing. The exercises may be sprinkled with purifying salt and may be given sake to spit into the waterfall in three mouthfuls. Sometimes the participants are given salt to throw into the waterfall as they enter. In some groups, the leader counts to nine, cuts the air, and shouts the word &quot;&quot;yei!&quot; to dispel this impurity. The participants then enter the waterfall while continuously chanting the phrase . This phrase asks the &quot;kami&quot; to wash away the impurity from the six elements that make up the human being, the five senses and the mind. The practice of this varies from group to group, each having their own traditions or methods.

Misogi is also used in some forms of martial arts, especially aikido, to prepare the mind for training and to learn how to develop one&#x27;s &quot;Dantian&quot;, or centre. The founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, regularly used this form of meditation to complement his training and search for perfection. The Sen Shin tei Misogi Well at Ki Society Headquarters in Japan is a well-known place for people performing misogi with cold water before sunrise.

<doc id="579400" wikidata="Q899017" url="?curid=579400" title="Levinthal's paradox">
<text>Levinthal&#x27;s paradox is a thought experiment in the field of computational protein structure prediction; protein folding seeks a stable energy configuration. An algorithmic search through all possible conformations to identify the minimum energy configuration (the native state) would take an immense duration; however in reality protein folding happens very quickly, even in the case of the most complex structures, suggesting that the transitions are somehow guided into a stable state through an uneven energy landscape. 
== History ==
In 1969, Cyrus Levinthal noted that, because of the very large number of degrees of freedom in an unfolded polypeptide chain, the molecule has an astronomical number of possible conformations. An estimate of 10300 was made in one of his papers (often incorrectly cited as the 1968 paper). For example, a polypeptide of 100 residues will have 200 different phi and psi bond angles, two within each residue. If each of these bond angles can be in one of three stable conformations, the protein may misfold into a maximum of 3200 different conformations (including any possible folding redundancy), not even considering the peptide linkages between each residue or the conformations of the side-chains. Therefore, if a protein were to attain its correctly folded configuration by sequentially sampling all the possible conformations, it would require a time longer than the age of the universe to arrive at its correct native conformation. This is true even if conformations are sampled at rapid (nanosecond or picosecond) rates. The &quot;paradox&quot; is that most small proteins fold spontaneously on a millisecond or even microsecond time scale. The solution to this paradox has been established by computational approaches to protein structure prediction.

Levinthal himself was aware that proteins fold spontaneously and on short timescales. He suggested that the paradox can be resolved if &quot;protein folding is sped up and guided by the rapid formation of local interactions which then determine the further folding of the peptide; this suggests local amino acid sequences which form stable interactions and serve as nucleation points in the folding process&quot;. Indeed, the protein folding intermediates and the partially folded transition states were experimentally detected, which explains the fast protein folding. This is also described as protein folding directed within funnel-like energy landscapes. Some computational approaches to protein structure prediction have sought to identify and simulate the mechanism of protein folding.

Levinthal also suggested that the native structure might have a higher energy, if the lowest energy was not kinetically accessible. An analogy is a rock tumbling down a hillside that lodges in a gully rather than reaching the base.

Levinthal&#x27;s paradox was cited on the first page of the Scientific Background to the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (awarded to David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John M. Jumper for computational protein design and protein structure prediction) by way of demonstrating the sheer scale of the problem given the astronomical number of permutations.

<text>Development communication refers to the use of communication to facilitate social development. Development communication engages stakeholders and policy makers, establishes conducive environments, assesses risks and opportunities and promotes information exchange to create positive social change via sustainable development. Development communication techniques include information dissemination and education, behavior change, social marketing, social mobilization, media advocacy, communication for social change, and community participation.
Development communication has been labeled as the &quot;Fifth Theory of the Press&quot;, with &quot;social transformation and development&quot;, and &quot;the fulfillment of basic needs&quot; as its primary purposes. Jamias articulated the philosophy of development communication which is anchored on three main ideas. Their three main ideas are: purposive, value-laden, and pragmatic. Nora C. Quebral expanded the definition, calling it &quot;the art and science of human communication applied to the speedy transformation of a country and the mass of its people from poverty to a dynamic state of economic growth that makes possible greater social equality and the larger fulfillment of the human potential&quot;. Melcote and Steeves saw it as &quot;emancipation communication&quot;, aimed at combating injustice and oppression. According to Melcote (1991) in Waisbord (2001), the ultimate goal of development communication is to raise the quality of life of the people, including; to increase income and wellbeing, eradicate social injustice, promote land reforms and freedom of speech

== Definition ==

Anirban Bosu Roy Choudhuri, in the lecture she delivered for an Honorary Doctorate at the London School of Economics, University of London in December 2011, clearly accounted that the Development Communication was first articulated on 10 December 1971 at the University of the Philippines in Los Banos (UPLB). At that time, the UPLB College of Agriculture held a symposium (in honor of Dr. Dioscoro L. Umali, a national scientist in the area of plant breeding) titled &quot;In Search of Breakthroughs in Agricultural Development&quot;.

A recent and more encompassing definition of development communication states that it is: Jan Carlo Sabile and the team
&quot;...the art and science of human communication linked to a society&#x27;s planned transformation from a state of poverty to one dynamic socio-economic growth that makes for greater equality and the larger unfolding of individual potentials.&quot;
Erskine Childers defined it as:
Development support communications is a discipline in development planning and implementation in which more adequate account is taken of human behavioural factors in the design of development projects and their objectives.
According to the World Bank, the Development Communication is the &quot;integration of strategic communication in development projects&quot; based on a clear understanding of indigenous realities.

In addition, the UNICEF views it as: &quot;a two-way process for sharing ideas and knowledge using a range of communication tools and approaches that empower individuals and communities to take actions to improve their lives.&quot;

Bessette (2006) defined development communication as a &quot;planned and systematic application of communication resources, channels, approaches and strategies to support the goals of socio-economic, political and cultural development&quot;. Development communication is essentially participatory, because, according to Ascroft and Masilela (1994) &quot;participation translates into individuals being active in development programmes and processes; they contribute ideas, take initiative and articulate their needs and their problems, while asserting their autonomy.&quot;

Who are development communicators? What qualities do they possess? Nora C. Quebral gave a succinct characterization:

# They understand the process of development, the process of communication, and the environment in which the two processes interact.
# They are knowledgeable in communication skills and techniques as well as proficient in subject matter to be communicated.
# They have internalized the values inherent in equity and the unfolding of individual potential.
# They have firsthand knowledge of the several kinds of end-users of development communication.
# They have a sense of commitment, the acceptance of individual responsibility for advancing human development.

== History ==

The practice of development communication began in the 1940s, but widespread application came about after World War II. The advent of communication sciences in the 1950s included recognition of the field as an academic discipline, led by Daniel Lerner, Wilbur Schramm and Everett Rogers. Both Childers and Quebral stressed that DC includes all means of communication, ranging from mass media from people to people.

According to Quebral (1975), the most important feature of Philippines-style development communications is that the government is the &quot;chief designer and administrator of the master (development) plan wherein, development communication, in this system then is purposive, persuasive, goal-directed, audience-oriented, and interventionist by nature&quot;.

== Academic schools ==

Various schools of development communication arose in response to challenges and opportunities in individual countries. Manyozo (2006) broke the field into six schools. The &quot;Bretton Woods&quot; school was originally dominant in international literature. The others were the Latin American, Indian, African, Los Baños and participatory schools.

=== Catholic social change ===

While not per se an academic school, the Church has been conducting &quot;development communication&quot; for many decades. The Catholic Church&#x27;s social teachings and moral norms parallel those of social development. &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; (On the New Things), for example, an encyclical written in 1891 by Pope Leo XIII critiqued social ills and promoted &quot;the Catholic doctrine on work, the right to property, the principle of collaboration instead of class struggle as the fundamental means for social change, the rights of the weak, the dignity of the poor and the obligations of the rich, the perfecting of justice through charity, on the right to form professional associations&quot; In 1961, Pope John XXIII, writing on the topic &quot;Christianity and Social Progress&quot;, produced an encyclical entitled &quot;Mater et magistra&quot; (Mother and Teacher), which taught that the &quot;Church is called in truth, justice and love to cooperate in building with all men and women an authentic communion. In this way, economic growth will not be limited to satisfying men&#x27;s needs, but it will also promote their dignity&quot;. Then in 1967, Pope Paul VI published &quot;Populorum Progressio&quot;(Progressive Development). In it the Pope underscored the importance of justice, peace, and development by declaring that &quot;development is the new name of peace&quot;. Addressing development workers, he said, &quot;genuine progress does not consist in wealth sought for personal comfort or for its own sake; rather it consists in an economic order designed for the welfare of the human person, where the daily bread that each man receives reflects the glow of brotherly love and the helping hand of God&quot;. The importance of engagement for social transformation and development is also asserted in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

=== Bretton Woods ===

The Bretton Woods school of development communication paralleled the economic strategies outlined in the Marshall Plan, the Bretton Woods system and of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in 1944.
The little-used name served to differentiate the original paradigm from other schools that evolved later. Leading theorists included Daniel Lerner, Wilbur Schramm and Everett Rogers. Due to his pioneering influence, Rogers was referred to as &quot;one of the founding fathers of development communication.&quot;

This approach to development communication was criticized by Latin American researchers such as Luis Ramiro Beltan and Alfonso Gumucio Dagron, because it emphasized problems in the developing nation rather than its unequal relation with developed countries. They claimed that it proposed industrial capitalism as a universal solution and that many projects failed to address obstacles such as lack of access to land, agricultural credits, and fair market prices.

Failed projects in the 1960s led to revisions. Manyozo found that the school had been the most dynamic in testing and adopting new approaches and methodologies.

Institutions associated with the Bretton Woods school of development communication include:
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
Rockefeller Foundation
Department for International Development, United Kingdom
Ford Foundation

=== Latin America ===

The Latin American school of development communication predates the Bretton Woods school, emerging in the 1940s with the efforts of Colombia&#x27;s Radio Sutatenza and Bolivia&#x27;s Radios Mineras. They pioneered participatory and educational approaches to empowering the marginalised. In effect, they served as the earliest models for participatory broadcasting efforts around the world.

In the 1960s Paolo Freire&#x27;s theories of critical pedagogy and Miguel Sabido&#x27;s enter-educate method became important elements of the Latin American development communication school.

Other influential theorists include Juan Diaz Bordenave, Luis Ramiro Beltran, and Alfonso Gumucio Dagron (Manyozo 2006, Manyozo, 2005).

In the 1990s, technological advances facilitated social change and development: new media outlets emerged, cable TV reached more regions, and the growth of local communication firms paralleled the growth of major media corporations.

=== India ===

Organized development communication in India began with rural radio broadcasts in the 1940s. Broadcasts adopted indigenous languages to reach larger audiences.

Organized efforts in India started with community development projects in the 1950s. The government, guided by socialist ideals and politicians, started many development programs. Field publicity was employed for person-to-person communication. The radio played an important role in reaching the masses because literacy was low. Educational institutions – especially agricultural universities, through their extension networks – and international organizations under the United Nations umbrella experimented with development communication.

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) relied on close inter-personal relations among communicators.

Communication from the government was more generic and unidirectional. So-called Public Information Campaigns were government-sponsored public fairs in remote areas that presented entertainment along with information on social and developmental schemes. Villagers engaged in competitions to attract attendees. Public and private organizations sponsored stalls in the main exhibition area. Development agencies and service/goods providers also attended. Some state governments employed this model.

Community radio was used in rural India. NGOs and educational institutions created local stations to broadcast information, advisories and messages on development. Local participation was encouraged. Community radio provided a platform for villagers to publicize local issues, offering the potential to elicit action from local officials.

The widespread adoption of mobile telephony in India created new channels for reaching the masses.

=== Africa ===

The African school of development communication sprang from the continent&#x27;s post-colonial and communist movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Anglophone Africa employed radio and theatre for community education, adult literacy, health and agricultural education (Kamlongera, 1983, Mlama, 1971).

In 1994, the FAO project &quot;Communication for Development in Southern Africa&quot; was a pioneer in supporting and enhancing development projects and programs through the use of participatory communication. The FAO project, placed under SADC, developed an innovative methodology known as Participatory Rural Communication Appraisal (PRCA), which combined participatory tools and techniques with a strong communication focus needed to enhance projects results and sustainability. FAO and SADC published a handbook on PRCA that was used in projects around the world.

The radio maintained a strong presence in research and practice into the 21st century. Radio was especially important in rural areas, as the work of the non-governmental organization Farm Radio International and its members across sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated. Knowledge exchange between development partners such as agricultural scientists and farmers were mediated through rural radio (Hambly Odame, 2003).

=== Philippines ===

Systematic study and practice began at the University of the Philippines Los Baños in the 1970s, through the establishment of the Department of Development Communication in the College of Agriculture, which offered undergraduate and master&#x27;s degrees.

Quebral coined the term &quot;development communication&quot; while at the university&#x27;s Office of Extension and Publications, now the College of Development Communication (CDC). According to Felix Librero, the term was first used by Quebral in her 1971 paper, &quot;Development Communication in the Agricultural Context,&quot; presented in at a symposium at the University of the Philippines Los Baños. In her paper, Quebral argued that development communication had become a science, requiring the tasks associated with communicating development-oriented issues be based on scientific inquiry. At the time the field was limited to agricultural and rural development.

At the time the term &#x27;development support communication&#x27; was used in UNDP programmes under Erskine Childers, with coauthor and wife, Malicca Vajrathron. This area of research focused on the functions of communication in promoting UN agricultural and development programmes. Development communication at Los Baños became an academic field rather than a techniques program. Quebral cited Seers&#x27;s definition of development in arguing for the term, as opposed to Childer&#x27;s &#x27;development support communication&#x27;, which was used in public and in the scientific literature for the first time. Librero recounted that colleagues in agricultural communications in Los Baños agreed with Quebral, but colleagues from the field of mass communication in the University of the Philippines Diliman, and from countries in North America, did not initially agree, although they ultimately relented.

In 1993, in the Institute of Development Communication&#x27;s faculty papers series, Alexander Flor proposed expanding the definition of development communication to include the perspective of cybernetics and general systems theory:

&quot;If information counters entropy and societal breakdown is a type of entropy, then there must be a specific type of information that counters societal entropy. The exchange of such information – be it at the individual, group, or societal level – is called development communication.&quot;

=== Participatory development communication ===
The evolution of the participatory development communication school involved collaboration between First World and Third World development communication organizations. It focused on community involvement in development efforts and was influenced by Freirean critical pedagogy and the Los Baños school (Besette, 2004).

=== World Bank ===

The World Bank actively promotes this field through its Development Communication division and published the &quot;Development Communication Sourcebook&quot; in 2008, a resource addressing the history, concepts and practical applications of this discipline.

Development Communication or Communication for Development

World Bank tends to espouse and promote the title &quot;Development Communication&quot; while UNICEF uses &quot;Communication for Development&quot;. The difference seems to be a matter of semantics and not ideology since the end goals of these global organizations are almost identical to each other.

UNICEF explains: 

World Bank defines Development Communication &quot;as an interdisciplinary field, is based on empirical research that helps to build consensus while it facilitates the sharing of knowledge to achieve a positive change in the development initiative. It is not only about effective dissemination of information but also about using empirical research and two-way communications among stakeholders&quot;. (Development Communication division, the World Bank).

== Examples ==
One of the first examples of development communication was Farm Radio Forums in Canada. From 1941 to 1965 farmers met weekly to listen to radio programs, supplemented by printed materials and prepared questions to encourage discussion. At first, this was a response to the Great Depression and the need for increased food production in World War II. Later the Forums dealt with social and economic issues. This model of adult education or distance education was later adopted in India and Ghana.
Radio DZLB was the community broadcasting station of UPLB College of Development Communication. It was a forerunner of the school-on-air (SOA) concept that provided informal education for farmers. DZLB hosted SOAs on nutrition, pest management and cooperatives. DZLB aired educational programming for farmers and cooperatives.
Established in 2009, Global South Development Magazine has been a recent example of development communication in practice.
Instructional television was used in El Salvador during the 1970s to improve primary education. One problem was a lack of trained teachers. Teaching materials were improved to make them more relevant. More children attended school and graduation rates increased.
In the 1970s in Korea the Planned Parenthood Federation succeed in lowering birth rates and improving life in villages such as Oryu Li. It mainly used interpersonal communication in women&#x27;s clubs. Oryu Li&#x27;s success did not recur in all villages. The initial effort had the advantage of a remarkable local leader and visits from the provincial governor.
A social marketing project in Bolivia in the 1980s tried to get women in the Cochabamba Valley to use soybeans in their cooking. This was an attempt to deal with chronic malnourishment among children. The project used cooking demonstrations, posters and broadcasts on local commercial radio stations. Some people tried soybeans but the outcome of the project was unclear.
In 1999 the US and DC Comics planned to distribute 600,000 comic books to children affected by the Kosovo War. The books were in Albanian and featured Superman and Wonder Woman. The aim was to teach children what to do when they find an unexploded land mine left over from Kosovo&#x27;s civil war. The comic books instruct children not to touch and not to move, but instead to call an adult for help.
Since 2002, Journalists for Human Rights, a Canadian NGO, has operated projects in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. JHR works directly with journalists, providing monthly workshops, student sessions, on the job training and additional programs on a country by country basis.
Cuban Media and Education – In 1961, the year of education, the well known literacy campaign was initiated. Television and radio played a complementary role in the dissemination of literacy training programs. Live coverage of literacy worker and students was used to dramatise and this was reinforced on radio and in newspapers.

== Policy ==
Development communication policy covers formal and informal processes where interests are defined, expressed and negotiated by actors with different levels of power and with the goal of influencing policy decisions.

Alexander G. Flor, PhD, a noted development communicator and professor at the University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB) and University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU), posits that development communication and the policy sciences are linked inextricably albeit distinct and mutually exclusive disciplines. &quot;Policy sciences&quot;, he states in a nutshell, is the scientific study of policies and policy-making while &quot;policy&quot; is the set of decisions with specific objectives and target audience.

Development communication is intended to build consensus and facilitate knowledge sharing to achieve positive change in development initiatives. It disseminates information and employs empirical research, two-way communication and dialogue among stakeholders. It is a management tool to help assess socio-political risks and opportunities. By using communication to bridge differences and take action towards change, development communication can lead to successful and sustainable results.

Development communication is a response to historic, social and economic factors that limit access to information and citizen participation. These include poverty and unemployment, limited access to basic services, remote settlement patterns, lack of access to technology, lack of information, inadequate health services, lack of education and skills and lack of infrastructure.

FAO asserted that communication can play a decisive role in promoting human development. Democracy, decentralization and the market economy empower individuals and communities to control their own destinies. Stimulating awareness, participation, and capabilities are vital. Policies must encourage effective planning and implementation of communication programs.

Lee advocated that communication policies and practices require joint action among leaders in social, economic, scientific, educational and foreign affairs and that success requires constant contact and consultation with communicators and citizens.

UNESCO conducted studies on communication policies as part of the resolutions adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO during its 16th session in 1970. Its objective was to promote awareness of communication policies at the governmental, institutional and professional levels of selected member states. The selected countries were Ireland, Sweden, Hungary, Yugoslavia, West Germany, and Brazil. Two years later, a UNESCO meeting of experts on communication policies and planning defined communication policy as a set of norms established to guide the behavior of communication media. According to these experts, the scope of communication policies comprises:
The values that determine the structure of communication systems and guide their operation
The systems of communication, their structures, and operation
The output of these systems and their impact and social functions

The Asian Media Information and Communication Centre (AMIC) was commissioned by UNESCO to do a feasibility study on &quot;Training in Communication Planning in Asia&quot; in 1974.
It organized the first AMIC Regional Conference on Development Communication Policies and Planning in Manila, Philippines in May 1977. Attended by delegates from ten countries, it drew up basic recommendations including the organization of national development communication councils by each country&#x27;s governmental, educational and media groups.

According to Habermann and De Fontgalland, the difficulties in the adoption of a viable development communication policy have to be simultaneously analyzed horizontally and vertically. Horizontally government agencies, semi-governmental offices (e.g., rural extension service), independent development organizations and private media outlets must coordinate policy. Vertically, information must flow in both directions between the population base and decision-making bodies. This involves local and supra-local administrations that are active in handing out directives and reporting back to the government. Commonly, default policies do not encourage/require such institutions to feed information from the populace to policymakers, with the exception of government extension bureaus.

In 1986 Quebral stressed the importance of equally recognizing systematic practice along with formal research as a legitimate basis for decisions. According to her, research must precede and become the foundation of policy.

=== Stakeholder analysis ===
The design and implementation of policies is becoming more complex, and the number and type of actors involved in policy implementation more diverse; hence, the policy process is evolving towards multi-actor and multi-goal situations. &quot;Stakeholder&quot; has been variously defined according to the goal of the analysis, the analytic approach or the policy area. Where several groups of stakeholders are involved in the policy process, a stakeholder analysis can provide a useful resource.

Stakeholder analysis can help analyze the behavior, intentions, interrelations, agendas, interests and the resources of stakeholders in the policy processes. Crosby described stakeholder analysis as offering methods and approaches to analyze the interests and roles of key players. Hannan and Freeman include groups or individual who can affect or be affected by the achievement of the organization&#x27;s objectives, while others exclude those who cannot influence the outcome. For instance, Brugha and Varvasovszky defined stakeholder as &quot;individuals, groups, and organizations who have an interest (stake) and the potential to influence the actions and aims of an organization, project, or policy direction.&quot; According to Flor, a stakeholder analysis of communication policy would reveal the interplay of the following sectors:
Government – Enacts all communication policies, making it the most powerful stakeholder.
Education sector – Conducts research that underlies subsequent policies.
Communication industry – Influences communication policies. May adopt self-regulation to avoid/delay government regulation. For example, the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas and the Philippine Press Institute institute ethics codes.
Private sector – Avoid policies that limit content and to protect themselves from opponents.
Religious sector – Traditionally opposes policies that allow obscenity, violence and profanity to be distributed.
Foreign interests – e.g., international lending agencies may demand the end of monopolies—including state media entities—as a condition for financial aid.
Consumers – Traditionally not consulted, but more recently claiming to protect the public interest.

The United Nations has recognised the importance of &quot;the need to support two-way communication systems that enable dialogue and that allow communities to express their aspirations and concerns and participate in decisions...&quot; Such two-way interactions can help expose local reality.
Keune and Sinha claim that community involvement in development communication policy is important, as they are the &quot;ultimate and perhaps the most important beneficiaries of development communication policies and planning&quot;.

=== Historical perspectives ===
Cuilenburg and McQuail (2003) identify three main phases of communications policy-making:
 Emerging Communications Industry Policy (until the Second World War)—during this era, communications policy mainly supported state and corporate benefits. Policy-covered telegraph, telephony and wireless and later, cinema. Policies were ad hoc measures designed to facilitate a series of technical innovations.
Public Service Media Policy (1945–1980)—After the Second World War, policy was dominated by sociopolitical rather than economic and national strategic concerns. This phase began after the Second World War. Policy expanded from addressing technical matters to the content of communications and to cover the traditional press.
New Communications Policy Paradigm (1980 to present)—Technological, economic and social trends fundamentally changed media policy from 1980 onward. Technological convergence became an agenda item when the US Office of Technology Assessment published its pioneering study, &quot;Critical Connections&quot; (OTA, 1990) followed by the European Union (CEC, 1997). &quot;Convergence&quot; meant that the boundaries between information technologies blurred: computer and telecommunications converged to telematics; personal computers and television become more similar; and formerly separated networks become interconnected. Regulation of mass media became increasingly linked to telecommunications regulation. Globalization and the permeability of national frontiers by multinational media limited the impact of policy in most countries.

=== Critiques ===

Development communication policy as a field experienced persistent conflict. Debates operated within the discourse of each period: autonomous vs. dependent in the 1950s; unequal North–South communication flows in the 60s and 70s; transnational corporations and non-governmental actors in the 80s; the converged global information society and the market-based media structure in the 90s; and online media and the digital divide in the 2000s.

==== Participation ====
Hamelink and Nordenstreng called for multistakeholder participation in information and communications technology (ICT) governance and for formal and informal policy development mechanisms to enable state and non-state actors to shape the media and communication industries.

==== Funding agency bias ====

Manyozo advocated a rethinking of communication for development policies, perceiving a failure by communication policy makers to identify funding institutions that encourage cultural imperialism and unequal power relations between Western and local organizations. He attributed this to the absence in communication policy debates of a political economy discourse. In reviewing the different approaches to communication for development policies—media, participation and community dialogue—Manyozo criticizes groups that emphasizes one over the others.

=== Development communication policy science ===

Development communication and the policy sciences provide a distinct role of development communication that is apart from traditional mass communication, its purposive nature (Flor, 1991). With this, communication strategies deemed at sustainable development are hereby presented (Servaes &amp; Malikhao (2007):
a) Behavior Change Communication (BCC, interpersonal communication)
b) Mass Communication (MC, mix of community media, mass media and ICTs)
c) Advocacy Communication (AC, mix of interpersonal and/or mass communication)
d) Participatory Communication (PC, interpersonal communication and community media)

Flor (1991) argues the importance of application of knowledge in social sciences where most of policy principles are drawn from. In the conduct of developmental activities, the role of communication is critical as it influences participation of individuals given that relevant information is well-disseminated. For instance, communication media are critical in creating awareness, generating public interest and demand, and placing the issue on the public agenda and building social support (Servaes, 2008).

Development communication policy science take off from development theory that which it says that policy recommendation becomes an engine to the process of social change (Servaes, 1986). The concept of development communication policy science has reference to the following:
a) Diffusion model which enunciates that &#x27;the role of communication was (1) to transfer technological innovations from development agencies to their clients, and (2) to create an appetite for change through raising a &#x27;climate for modernization&#x27; among the members of the public&#x27;.
b) The participatory model which incorporates the concept of multiplicity development through democratization and participation at all levels – international, national, local and individual but values the cultural identity of local communities.

A typology of Participation in Development Initiatives illustrates a participation ladder (Mefalopulos, 2018) starting from the lowest form which is merely a form of token participation, to the highest form, where local stakeholders share equal weight in decision making with external stakeholders. The participation ladder consists of the following: (a) Passive participation. Stakeholders participate by being informed about what is going to happen or has already happened. People&#x27;s feedback is minimal or nonexistent, and individual participation is assessed mainly through head-counting and occasionally through their participation in the discussion. (b) Participation by consultation Stakeholders participate by providing feedback to questions posed by outside researchers or experts. Because their input is not limited to meetings, it can be provided at different points in time. In the final analysis, however, this consultative process keeps all the decision-making power in the hands of external professionals who are under no obligation to incorporate stakeholders&#x27; input. (c) Functional participation. Stakeholders take part in discussions and analysis of pre-determined objectives set by the project. This kind of participation, while it does not usually result in dramatic changes on &quot;what&quot; objectives are to be achieved, does provide valuable inputs on &quot;how&quot; to achieve them. Functional participation implies the use of horizontal communication among stakeholders. (d) Empowered participation. Stakeholders are willing and able to be part of the process and participate in joint analysis, which leads to joint decision making about what should be achieved and how. While the role of outsiders is that of equal partners in the initiative, local stakeholders are equal partners with a decisive say in decisions concerning their lives.
Flor recognizes the affinity of Development Communication and Policy Science; hence coined &quot;Development Communication Policy Science&quot;. In his writings, this concept can be deduced to mean creating guidelines that &quot;stems from the need for actively applying knowledge from and principles of the social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change&quot; and of which in the process communication is a critical variable.

UNESCO posits that in order to effect positive developmental change, there is a need to form people and processes that facilitate the creation of knowledge. For development to happen, a two-way horizontal model which allow direct participation of those most affected by the development issue(s) can be adopted. In this model, the stakeholder&#x27;s participation are in a form of defining and implementing solutions and identifying development directions. Engaging in dialogue with stakeholders for purposes of understanding their perceptions, perspectives, values, attitudes and practices are essential inputs to the design and implementation of development initiatives.

Development communication policy science is a thriving and a contemporary field in social sciences. It is the application of the policy sciences to improve policy development, implementation and evaluation in the development communication context. According to Flor (1991), development communication and policy sciences are regarded as distinct and mutually exclusive areas of study but are inextricably linked. He added that development communication and the policy sciences, although different in scope, stem from the same rationale: the need for actively applying knowledge from the principles of social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change. Separately, development communication is a purposive, pragmatic, and value-laden development intervention while the policy sciences are the scientific study of policies and policy-making for the social good. Both endorse a normative or prescriptive role for the social sciences, work to alleviate societal problems and recognize communication&#x27;s important function (Ongkiko &amp; Flor, 2006). As an academic discipline, development communication policy science is the study of the use of the art and the science of policy in the development communication context.
Development communication&#x27;s ultimate goal is to catalyze local development activities, local development planning and implementation, and local communication to smoothen the path to development. It is the science which uses communication to educate, change and motivate people&#x27;s attitudes and values leading to developmental goals Policy is a term which frames the action rather than simply describing it (Colebatch, 2002). Thus, it labels what we see so that we can make sense of it in a particular way. Understanding policy means understanding the way in which practitioners use it to shape action. It leads us to ask who is involved in what setting, how the action is framed and what significance in this process of the idea of authorized purpose, and not simply an outcome. Indeed, the &quot;approach of the policy science is forward-looking and anticipatory&quot;.

Thus, development communication comprises the utilization of strategic communication to address the pressing issues and problems in the society. It is an area of study where the roles of media to aid in the social transformation is considered an utmost importance. According to Melkotea and Steeves (2015), while communication has been referred to as shared meaning, development is considered as empowerment in the development communication, where it seeks to understand the social issues at all levels.

The two fields are undoubtedly different. However, Flor accurately stated that &quot;both stem from the same rationale: the need for actively applying knowledge and principles of the social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change&quot;. The connection between the two fields will be apparent once the question, &#x27;what is the policy for?&#x27; is answered. Since policy is the pursuit of goals and the effect they have on the action; and development communication aims to facilitate social change, the two processes are represented as a sequence of stages in the development, beginning with the thought and the intention (policy), moving through action brought about by communication, and ending with the solution (action). To reiterate, unless the policy decision could shape the action, there would be no point in making it.

When policy sciences and development communication have been firmly established in an organization or community, the instruments of policy analysis will provide &quot;unprecedented versatility and effectiveness&quot; (Lasswell, 1969). Specifically, the practice and application of social marketing strategies to influence the stakeholders in making decisions to create not only an individual but also social change.

It is important to know and understand that the stakeholders are not only the decision makers alone. Flor (1991) identified seven sectors as stakeholders: the government, the education sector, the communication, industry, the private sector, the church, foreign vested interests and the consumers. Flor discussed the different concerns of each sectors such as the education sector for its involvement in communication aspect; the church, in fulfillment of its outreach activities; and the private sectors concerning how policies would affect how they do business. But among the enumerated sectors, the government still serves as the most powerful sector as it has a direct hand in implementing policies. While the government is the most powerful, the most important stakeholder, but apparently the least involved in development of a policy, is actually the consumer or the regular citizens. While the government may impose a policy or a regulation, the success of it falls on the adoption and cooperation of the consumers.

Development communication is a contemporary field in social science. It uses scientific methods to enrich its own field through research where theories and principles can be derived and applied to development problems. It is defined as the interaction of two social processes- development and communication-in any given environment, and in 1971, the definition changed to the art and science of human communication applied to the speedy transformation of a country and the mass of its people from poverty to a dynamic state of economic growth that makes possible greater social equality and the larger fulfillment of the human potential. Its domain is best described by the phrase &#x27;communication and development&#x27;. This suggests that both mediated and non-mediated forms of communication are relevant to the development issue. This compromise is especially useful with the growing importance for development of the new information and communication technologies. The main scope and functions of development communication are not exclusively about communicating information and messages, but it also involves engaging stakeholders and assessing the situation. Communication is not only about &quot;selling ideas.&quot; Such a conception could have been appropriate in the past, currently, the scope of development communication has broadened to include an analytical aspect as well as a dialogical one—intended to open public spaces where perceptions, opinions, and knowledge of relevant stakeholders can be aired and assessed. It is applied to engage stakeholders, assess the situation, and devise effective strategies leading to better and more sustainable development initiatives. It is more than transmitting information. It is about using communication to generate new knowledge and consensus in order to facilitate change. Between the two social processes, Communication is the vehicle that carries development onward. Quebral (2012) mentioned in the definition of Development Communication the art and science of human communication. The science of communication is a research-driven consultative process involving planning, design and implementation of strategic interventions. It provides relevant information and adequate motivation to impact on attitudes and behaviors of individuals or groups of people. The artistic side of communication involves designing creative messages and products, and identifying effective interpersonal, group and mass-media channels based on the sound knowledge of the participants we seek to reach. Communication for Development is a social process based on dialogue using a broad range of tools and methods. It is also about seeking change at different levels, including listening, building trust, sharing knowledge and skills, building policies, debating and learning for sustained and meaningful change.

Development Communication and Policy Sciences are inextricably linked. Policy Sciences grew out of a multidisciplinary effort within the social sciences, based initially at the University of Chicago and later at the Social Science Research Council (SSRC), to develop theories and methods of integrating insights from multiple disciplines in the interest of providing a distinct integrative framework for understanding and addressing complex social problems. The University of Chicago and SSRC developments were themselves an outgrowth of earlier efforts that dated to at least the middle of the 19th century.). It is a new set of paradigm which is oriented towards the needs of applying structured rationality, systematic knowledge and organized creativity to the directed development of humanity. The main concern of Policy Sciences is with understanding and improvement of macro control systems, which is, policy making systems. Policy making is not about its substantive content but rather with the improved methods, knowledge, and systems for better policy making. In 1971, Lasswell&#x27;s identified two separate approaches to the policy sciences: one emphasizing in knowledge of the policy process and another emphasizing knowledge for use in the policy process. Lasswell&#x27;s chosen phrase was &quot;the policy sciences of democracy&quot;. To stress &quot;sciences&quot; resulted in a vision of rational analysis, while to stress &#x27;democracy; led to a vision of politicizes governmental processes. The distinction is important in drawing attention to policy analysis as an academic activity concerned primarily with advancing understanding; and policy analysis as applied activity concerned mainly with contributing to the solution of social problems. This vision of scientific method and democratic humanism, however, proved operationally difficult as the policy sciences moved to realize status and recognition during the 1960 and 1970&#x27;s. These two approaches- process and content strengthened their respective identities, each claiming some sort of conceptual superiority. Operationally the two approaches are: POLICY ANALYSIS is concerned with knowledge in and for policy process, while, POLICY PROCESS is concerned with knowledge about the formation and implementation of public policy. Policy analysis and Policy process focus on real-world problems and require application of both normative and behavioral sciences. The underlying disciplines of policy sciences are the management sciences (operations research, cost-effective analysis, systems analysis, economics and more) and the behavioral sciences (political science, sociology, social psychology, organization theory, behavioral theory of the firm, psychology of judgment and more). The management sciences can be viewed as sciences of normative knowledge- what one should do with the application of their methodologies involving optimization of some objective function.

Policy Sciences has long been at the forefront of development issues. while, Development Communication&#x27;s chief purpose is about social transformation and development, the fulfillment of basic needs. Both fields, development communication and policy sciences are concerned with scientific methods, and choosing and evaluating the relevance of available knowledge for the solution of particular problems that will enrich humanity. In essence, development communication is the sharing of knowledge aimed at reaching a consensus for action that takes into account the interests, needs and capacities of all concerned. It is thus a social process. While, Policy Sciences hold forth the hope of improving the most backward of all human institutions and habits, which is policy making and decision making. It constitutes a major attempt to assert and achieve a central role for rationality and intellectualism in human affairs and to increase by jumps the capacity of humanity to direct its future.

==== Policy sciences ====
Policy sciences provide an integrated approach in solving various problems in local, national, regional and international level. Coined by Harold D. Lasswell, policy sciences draw knowledge from various disciplines where recommendations are formulated, hence, its integrated approach. Because of its integrative nature, policy sciences follow a systems approach such that elements are interrelated and forms a &#x27;generality principle&#x27;.

Following its interdisciplinary nature is the idea that policy sciences encourage diversity of perspectives from various disciplines. This instigates consultative communication from various individuals in the principle of common interest.

In the pursuit of knowledge, policy scientists need to be careful in deciphering relevance of particular knowledge given the impact of various knowledge sources that are trying to influence policy decisions. In this regard, informed decisions are drawn from critiquing, careful analysis and recommendations that will be beneficial to many rather than a few individuals. 
Lasswell (1970: 3) defines policy sciences as &quot;knowledge of the policy process as well as knowledge in this process&quot;. Torgerson (1985) states that Lasswell proposed the development of policy science-or policy sciences-as an interdisciplinary field to embrace all the social sciences and to produce knowledge applicable to public problems. The term &quot;policy sciences&quot; in its plural form, therefore, emphasizes its interdisciplinary nature (Flor, 1991). According to Hale (2011), the central aim of policy sciences is to resolve problems [in the service of human dignity] and the diverse human, historical, and contextual element in public policy-making. This is a reiteration of the Lasswellian maxim on public policy in the following key elements: &quot;contextual&quot;; &quot;problem-oriented&quot;; &quot;multi-method inquiry&quot; or diverse empirical methods, &quot;political&quot;, &quot;normative, welfare-oriented&quot; in the case of social policy goals; and posing &quot;interdisciplinarity&quot; or moving between humanities and social sciences. Indeed, Lasswell&#x27;s original goal of the policy sciences was to provide, &quot;intelligence pertinent to the integration of values realized by and embodied by interpersonal relations [such as] human dignity and the realization of human capacities&quot; (Lasswell and Kaplan, 1950: p. xii). The &quot;policy sciences&quot; therefore adopts an approach to understanding and solving problems that draw on and contribute to all fields of knowledge (Quebral, 2006) and sets out procedures in an integrated and comprehensive form to help clarify and secure common interests.

According to Harold Lasswell (1971), the policy sciences are concerned with the knowledge &quot;of&quot; and &quot;in&quot; the decision processes of the public and civic order. Knowledge of decision processes points to the empirical and scientific understanding of how policies are made and executed. At one moment, the analyst regards his subject-matter as an objective phenomenon, but this phase alternates with another in which the analyst comes to view himself as actively involved in the phenomenon which he investigates. Inquiry displays both tension and interplay between these moments; they are distinct yet interwoven, complementary in the ongoing development and refinement of contextual orientation (Togerson, 1985). Empirical knowledge pertains to those generated through scientific inquiry and observation as applied to decision processes. As such, the notion of the policy sciences is construed in various shades since it was introduced in the 1940s and over the years, Lasswell and his colleagues refined the concept, through practice and peer review, as the intellectual tools needed to support problem-oriented, contextual, and multi-method inquiry in the service of human dignity for all. The policy sciences is a forward-looking body of knowledge, with the plural form emphasizing its interdisciplinary and holistic nature. It recognizes the multiplicity of factors affecting certain problems and multi-dimensions of certain phenomena that are subject to decision processes. According to Laswell (1971, p. 39), an adequate strategy of problem solving in policy sciences encompasses five intellectual tasks performed at varying levels of insight and understanding namely: goal clarification; trend description; analysis of conditions; projection of developments; and invention, evaluation, and selection of alternatives. As such, the emphasis of policy sciences is on applying scientific or empirical evidences in understanding problems so that more realistic, responsive and effective interventions are identified and implemented. Since a problem is multidimensional, various scientific disciplines are needed to form a comprehensive analysis of a certain phenomenon. The trend toward a policy sciences viewpoint is a move away from fragmentation and the fragmented &quot;worm&#x27;s eye view&quot; of policy matters.

According to Yehezkel Dror in his article entitled, &quot;Approaches to Policy Sciences,&quot; two of the main features of policy sciences can be summarized as follows:
1) Policy sciences, as with all applied scientific knowledge, are, in principle, instrumental-normative in the sense of being concerned with means and intermediate goals rather than absolute values. But policy sciences are sensitive to the difficulties of achieving &quot;value free sciences&quot; and try to contribute to value choice by exploring value implications, value consistencies, value costs, and the behavioral foundations of value commitments.
2) Policy sciences emphasize meta-policies (that is, policies on policies), including modes of policy-making, policy analysis, policy-making systems, and policy strategies. While the main test of policy sciences is better achievement of considered goals through more effective and efficient policies, policy sciences as such do not deal with discrete policy problems, but do provide improved methods and knowledge for doing so. Furthermore, he mentioned that the main foci of concern for policy sciences include, for example, (i) policy analysis, which provides heuristic methods for identification of preferable policy alternatives; (ii) policy strategies, which provide guidelines for postures, assumptions, and main guidelines to be followed by specific policies (for example, with respect to incrementalism versus innovation, attitudes to risk and time, comprehensive versus shock policies, and goal-oriented versus capacity oriented policies); (iii) evaluation and feedback, including, for instance, social indicators, social experimentation, and organizational learning; and (iv) improvement of the system for policymaking-by redesign and sometimes nova design (designing anew), including changes in input, personnel, structure, equipment, external demands, and so forth.

As defined by Laswell (1970), the policy sciences may be conceived as knowledge of the policy process and of the relevance of knowledge in the process. Its approach is anticipatory which aims to improve policymaking in order to provide as much lead time as necessary in the solution of societal problems. However, it should be considered that since it is a science, the knowledge that can be acquired in the process should be based on the concept of scientific evidence. Therefore, one issue that may arise along the way is how to regard societal problems and issues scientifically. However, according to Lasswell and McDougal (1992), while the problems are addressed scientifically, there is also a need for considering the contextual and normative approach to solving problems. The reason is that the knowledge produced is not only universalizable but ethical and empirico-analytical. Through this, policy science is thought not only problem-oriented but also multidisciplinary and contextual.

Generally, the relationship between development communication and the policy sciences can be described as inextricable although both fields of study have different concentration, scope, and limitations. Furthermore, both development communication and the policy sciences share the same practice: the need for actively applying knowledge from and principles of the social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change. In today&#x27;s society where it is being described as troubled and problematic, there is no better way to confront the societal issues but to have a strong knowledge and a better understanding of communication policy.

In the context of communication policy development, the policy sciences are necessary to make more purposeful, responsive, and effective communication policies. Profoundly influenced by Freud and Marx, Lasswell emphasized the importance of the contextual orientation of policy analysts, both individually and collectively (Lasswell, 1965). When he first articulated this principle of contextuality, Lasswell indeed referred explicitly to the &quot;exposition of the dialectical method&quot; (1965) in Lukacs&#x27;s &quot;History and Class Consciousness&quot;, adding that the insights of psychoanalysis provided a complement to the Marxian dialectic which would aid in understanding &quot;the symbolic aspects of historical development&quot; (Laswell, 1965, p. 19). Here Lasswell proposed a mode of contextual-configurative analysis whereby, through &quot;an act of creative orientation&quot; (Laasswell, 1965, p. 13), the inquirer could locate himself in an &#x27;all-encompassing totality&quot; (Lasswell, 1965, p. 12). In this regard, Lasswell considered such contextual orientation indispensable to the conduct of rational inquiry, and urged the use of contextual-configurative analysis in the development of a policy science profession. Hale (2011, p. 221) contends that Lasswell saw that robust policy solutions could only be obtained by insisting upon a commitment to contextuality, problem orientation, and methodological diversity. All for good reasons: first, no decision can adequately be understood apart from the larger social process in which it is itself apart. Thus contextuality is a key element in the policy sciences. As a reliance on ideology, principle, and grand historical projects cannot, given the complexity and contextuality of policy problems, serve with reliable solution, a discipline geared to resolve problems should expressly orient itself on those problems and should be purposeful. Thus problem orientation is the second key element in the policy sciences. Finally, due to the multidimensionality and complexity of many of these problems it stands to reason that the policy scientist should draw from a diversity of methodologies. Thus methodological diversity is the third key element in the policy sciences. It is Lasswell&#x27;s sincere belief that understanding the policy formation and decision-making process will eventually also be beneficial in the creation of public policy (Hale, 2011).

Hepp, A., Roitsch, C., &amp; Berg, M. (2016) introduces the approach of contextualised communication network analysis as a qualitative procedure for researching communicative relationships realised through the media. It combines qualitative interviews on media appropriation, egocentric network maps, and media diaries. Through the triangulation of these methods of data collection, it is possible to gain a differentiated insight into the specific meanings, structures and processes of communication networks across a variety of media. The approach is illustrated using a recent study dealing with the mediatisation of community building among young people. In this context, the qualitative communication network analysis has been applied to distinguish &quot;localists&quot; from &quot;centrists&quot;, &quot;multilocalists&quot;, and &quot;pluralists&quot;. These different &quot;horizons of mediatised communitisation&quot; are connected to distinct communication networks. Since this involves today a variety of different media, the contextual analysis of communication networks necessarily has to imply a cross-media perspective.

To guide communication policy-makers in addressing challenges, Picard and Pickard (2017) proposed policy principles that aim to guide contemporary media and communications policymaking in democratic countries so the contributions of these operations and systems to society may be improved. They maintain that &quot;Media and communications policies are central to many of the social and political issues that societies face today.&quot; However, existing policies are often unable to respond to rapid technological, economic, political, and social developments because they address only particular media and communication challenges at a particular time. On the other hand, fundamental principles are constant, thus providing guidance on how to respond to new concerns and challenges and making appropriate policies.

Picard and Pickard (2017) note that &quot;policy principles are coherent statements based on underlying norms and values that help policymakers and organisations respond to issues and take part in legislative and regulatory activities&quot;. In practice, principles are articulated and then used to set policy objectives and determine the means to achieve them. The latter two stages opine Picard and Pickard (2017), are subjected to &quot;political&quot; processes that determine the final policy outcome.

Picard and Pickard (2017) therefore came up with the following rubric list of potential principles that they believe are crucial in crafting a much reflective communication policy:

# Meeting fundamental communication and content needs;
# Providing effective ability for public use of media and communications;
# Promoting diversity/plurality in ownership of media and content available;
# Affording protection for users and society;
# Providing transparency and accountability;
# Pursuing developmental and economic benefits; and
# Pursuing equitable and effective policy outcomes.

The authors (Picard and Pickard, 2017) disaggregated these key principles as follows:

Principles are therefore not neutral, because they are normative, reflecting specific values that are subject to contestation. In choosing among policy principles, Picard and Pickard (2017) assert that policymakers should optimally be concerned about &quot;effects of policy on all stakeholders&quot;, giving primacy to fundamental communication &quot;needs&quot; of society and seeking to &quot;balance&quot; social and economic benefit.

&quot;Communication and Culture, Conflict and Cohesion&quot; is a book edited by Alexander G. Flor (2002), an expert on Knowledge Management for Development, which discusses the need for convergence in society through inter-cultural communication, using case studies in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It also examines environmental conflicts, indigenous peoples, and the official development assistance in the Philippines. In the book, Flor noted that communication and culture are &quot;inextricably linked&quot;. Societal conflict in this age of informatization is a &quot;function of culture caused by a dysfunction of societal communication&quot;. The quality and degree of societal communication – the mass media and education—determine the ways that cultures are exposed to others. The higher the quality and degree of inter-cultural communication, the lower the propensity for conflict, and vice versa. He observed that many of the world&#x27;s contemporary wars – in Rwanda, Basque, Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Aceh, East Timor—are not being waged by national political struggles &quot;but by cultures&quot;. For example, Catholic bishops and Islam ulama agree that the conflict in the island of Mindanao in the Philippines is triggered by &quot;opposing value systems (on the use of natural resources), opposing social structures (feudal vs. oligarchic), and opposing worldviews (materialistic vs. idealistic)&quot; – all of which, Flor noted, are components of culture. One of the first steps to help repair the situation is for communication policy scientists to &quot;begin with tolerance as a short-term solution, and understanding as a long-term solution&quot;. Tolerance and understanding require &quot;good communication&quot; from both ends of the spectrum that are striving to achieve &quot;mutual understanding&quot; – the goal of Kincaid (1979) for communication in his Convergence Model. The concept of convergence looks at the communication process as cyclical between source and receiver, and interactive between their message and feedback. &quot;With convergence comes cohesion.&quot; Mutual understanding achieved through communication helps preclude conflicts, and encourages cohesion among the world&#x27;s cultures.


==== Communication policy science ====
The atmosphere of participation created by recent administrations has brought about a more significant role for the development communication specialist/ policy scientist. His involvement in communication policymaking is facilitated by the so-called institutionalization of people power. His expertise may be directly tapped by the most important stakeholder, the media consumer. The participation of information users and media consumers in policy making may be realized by the formation of a nationwide media consumer&#x27;s organization or a federation of local organizations of this nature in which policy analysts play a significant role. This proposed organization could initiate media education in the formal and non-formal modes. Media education at the formal level may be facilitated by lobbying for the inclusion of such in existing secondary and tertiary curricula. Non-formal education may be conducted through media consumer sponsored awareness campaigns. This organization could also conduct its own audience related studies and policy research. It could establish a nationwide network involving the church, academic communities, grassroots organizations and cause-oriented groups. Communication policy scientists may also serve as part of the staff of our legislators in the Congress and Senate. In their private capacities, they can form research and development outfits or &quot;think tanks&quot; whose services may be availed of by government agencies. Indeed, now is a fortuitous time for policy engagement in development communication.

Culture, politics, economics and technology have an impact on policy decisions. In order to investigate the factors that influence communications policy, one has to go beyond conventional views of media and communication and should combine these with policy studies.

According to experts, communication policy science would be understood if the public just had access to the right scientific information. Coyle, in his article &quot;Theory of Development Communication&quot;, articulates that people have options to change their ways of life through communication. People improve their lives and ways of thinking through communication, sharing their perspectives and understanding what is going on in their surroundings. As highlighted by Flor, communication development has something to do with policy science as these are anchored for improving policy making.

As stipulated in Walt Rostow&#x27;s theory in Boado&#x27;s article, societies progress through specific stages of development on their way to modernity. Policy makers and scientists can communicate directly with the public through social media and blogging. By using social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook, policymakers and scientists can serve as critical mediators in disseminating scientific information by sharing advancements directly with society.

=====Communication policy and its dimensions=====

Citing an article, &quot;Dimensions of an Information and Communication Policy&quot;: &quot;for a national policy to be effective, it must attempt to be comprehensive, covering issues that are considered relevant for that particular society&quot;. Because it involves communication, the use of many forms is deemed important, such as traditional and indigenous cultural forms, print media, electronic/broadcast media, film, cinema among others. Such communication policy must be centered on development, in transforming the lives of marginalized people. Development encompasses economic benefits, health improvement, education and other transformative agents. The process involves people empowerment in identifying goals, needs, and solutions to various challenges. Thus, communication policy that is national in scope has broad objective dimensions as well as specific areas where community needs are addressed. Intervention of communication strategies such as dissemination of information both mediated and personal where the latter constitutes participatory communication is deemed important.

John A.R. Lee, author of &quot;Towards Realistic Communication Policies: Recent Trends and Ideas Compiled and Analysed&quot;, published by The Unesco Press, shares that every state or nation carries communication policies. These policies are stated/embedded in &quot;legislation, conditions, codes of conduct, rules and proceedings&quot; or implied/suggested &quot;in accepted practices.&quot; He adds that they are present &quot;at the national, institutional and professional levels.&quot;

By citing a Unesco report made by experts on communication and planning, Lee defines communication policies as &quot;sets of principles and norms established to guide the behaviour of communication systems.&quot;

He adds that the dimensions of communication policies as well as communication planning encompass the communication system, its components and structures; the functions of the system; the &quot;clients&quot; or audience using the system; the types of information carried by the system and its components; the values and qualities of the information content; and a variety of considerations about the system, its functions, audience, types of information and qualities. Members of the audience are classified based on such characteristics as age, sex, occupations, socio-economic strata, urban-rural (locations) and persuasions. Types of information refer to the conversation, cultural forms, data, education, entertainment, general information, music, news and opinion. Meanwhile, truth, objectivity, relevance, educational effectiveness, violence, humour, sex, libel are examples of values and qualities of the information content.

According to Lee, the &quot;consideration, identification and determination&quot; of the scope of specific communication systems and societal principles and norms are needed in formulating communication policies.

In his paper, Lee also discusses participation in the formulation of communication policies by asking, &quot;Who is involved?&quot; and identifying the stakeholders. They are government executive, legislative bodies, authorities in charge of social and economic planning, individual ministries and their planning boards, communication enterprises, professional organizations, the citizen, the social scientist and the economist.

E. Lloyd Sommerland, UNESCO Regional Communication Adviser for Asia, points out the difference between communication policies and communication planning by saying that the former provides &quot;the principles, rules and guidelines on which the communication system is built,&quot; while the latter is concerned with the policy implementation.

He shares that every country engages in development planning that touches different sectors of a society like &quot;agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, education, health, transport and communication, social and community services.&quot; At the heart of these plans for development is communication. &quot;Communication is part and parcel of this whole process of development and needs its own infrastructure,&quot; said Summerland. The word &quot;communication&quot; in this particular context includes telecommunications, mass media (print and broadcast), face-to-face communication and traditional channels and these are resources tapped by a society &quot;to enable information to flow within it&quot;, he adds.

The author emphasizes the role of communication in national development.

Sommerland also underlines that communication policies are not the ends and they provide a framework for action. He makes a reference to what a UNESCO expert group has said that behind these policies is strategic planning.

&quot;(It) determines the alternative ways to achieve long-range goals and sets the frame of reference for shorter-range operational planning. Strategic planning translates into quantified targets and systematic approaches, the general objectives of communication policies,&quot; he says.

Sommerland also supports some claims of Lee that communication policies are either embedded or implied in the existing policies of a nation.

&quot;For a country to try and formulate a coherent national communication policy does not, of course, imply that no policies in this area already exist,&quot; the former says. &quot;...Because communication is interdisciplinary and because it is the thread which binds a nation together, communication policies even if incomplete and implicit, are to be found in many different parts of a political and social system.

==== Development communication and policy sciences as mutually constitutive fields ====
Development communication and policy sciences exhibits mutuality as catalysts of change in this fluid environment. Both are geared towards effecting change in society. Will these two sciences be robustly beneficial if converged in one developmental framework? Allen (as cited in Flor, 1991) postulates that policy is a science of decision-making based on empirical data gathered from observation. One important characteristic of policies is, it is created to facilitate civic order, an agent to development process. How does it relate to development communication? Although a relatively young science, Development Communication has now been recognized and adopted by various agencies: the government and private sector as a means to institute effective changes using bottom-up approach. In the same vein, policy sciences grew out of this need to reorient actively the social sciences to the resolution of policy issues. Recognizing that every human being is a value-shaper and sharer in the social process, interaction as whole has been considered systemically by both sciences. A policy science is anchored on its &quot;intelligence&quot; function, followed by mobilization and bureaucratic reforms where mobilization is a key component of development communication. Development communication practitioners are well-equipped when it comes to understanding social phenomena which can aid in the &quot;intelligence function&quot; of policy scientists. The development agenda of both sciences are anchored on &quot;contextuality,&quot; meaning both recognizes the human&#x27;s social values and institutions in drafting interventions, plans and policies to achieve an &quot;enlightened society&quot;.

These policies are products of Development Communication initiatives that can influence decision makers or the government in enacting pertinent laws for the benefit of the publics. Development communication&#x27;s process is akin to policy science as both recognizes the context or the environment where humans socially interact. Both are using social science procedures in solving large-scale problems and further acknowledges communication as an integral part of the process. Hence one can surmise that policy decision-making is dependent on communication.

In an era of rapid development, each field should not be viewed as dialectically superior against the other, rather both development communication and policy sciences should mutually work to advance for the social change. The thrusts and goals of Development communication can be sustainable if it is backed by certain policies.

Following Quebral&#x27;s definition of Development communication &quot;the &quot;art&quot; and &quot;science&quot; of &quot;human communication&quot; applied to &quot;speedy transformation&quot; of a country and the mass of its people from &quot;poverty&quot; to &quot;dynamic state of economic growth&quot; that makes possible &quot;greater social equality&quot; and the &quot;larger fulfillment of human potential&quot;&quot;, Flor and Ongkiko explained each aspect of this definition for better understanding on why development communication was defined this way.

ART

In relaying a message, creativity is needed to attract the attention of its audience. It does not focus only on beautifying the message or the image but the art of communicating with people that would help them understand and adapt to the changes that will happen to them.

SCIENCE

As Flor and Ongkiko emphasize, development communication is a social science. At the same time, it is both theory and practices. The theory is backed-up with science in order to understand a situation, then the application or execution of plans towards development is the practice. A systematic approach which mostly based on the methods of science is followed in order to address a situation. The most commonly used method is identifying the problem, gathering data about the problem and develop communication processes that will be useful in able to address the situation and helped the community for development.

HUMAN COMMUNICATION

This is an important aspect for development communication because it is people-centred. The people need to communicate with one another for their own development. The people behind the development is reaching out to the people who need development. That is human communication.

SPEEDY TRANSFORMATION

This represents the social change that will happen to the community. All the researches made in able to identify the problem must put into action for the transformation of the lives of the people in the community.

POVERTY

The greatest challenge in development communication is poverty. Even in the Millennium Development Goals of United Nations, poverty is at the top of the list that needs to address with the hope of eradicating it in the future. Because of poverty, many people are experiencing malnutrition, unemployment and illiteracy which adds to the burden of the people.

DYNAMIC STATE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, GREATER SOCIAL EQUALITY, LARGER FULFILLMENT OF HUMAN POTENTIAL

Since the goal is for development, this is a continuous process. The aim is to help the people with their economic, social, and environmental goals.

Noticeably, everything that was mentioned in the explanation of the definition of development communication has something to do with goals, progress, theory, research, problem identification, and practices. Thomas L. McPhail, also describes development communication as a process of change using education or media as long as it is for the purpose of positive social change.

This coincides with Harold Lasswell&#x27;s vision that policy sciences bring together social sciences and practical policymaking to solve public problems, formalizing the link between the two.

As mentioned, development communication is backed with science through theories by identifying the problems needed to address. Lasswell identified policy science as problem-solving, with the idea of when addressing the problems, it should focus on human dignity or the fulfilment of human potential as Quebral said on her definition of development communication.

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

According to Jaime B. Ramirez (2011), members of the development media have considered economic and social development as one of the significant and vital signs of national development. Admittedly, he said, development communication cam always bridge gaps between the traditional and modern changing society, as it can raise the full aspirations of the people under the new society in the overall strategy for change. Development communication accordingly, can enforce social norms. In terms of policy sciences, development communication Ramirez adds, can broaden the policy dialogue by providing the two-way flow of information and opinion required for development as a nation. It, therefore, plays a potent and major role to economic and social development as well as political power. Without sacrificing its freedom, the development media can contribute to the growth of democratic institutions and to political stability, essential to national development.

===== Social marketing and social mobilization for development =====
In the aim to address and solve the myriad of societal problems of various contexts, the policy sciences are important to be able to have a more structured operational and strategic plan. In view of this, the role of social marketing and social mobilization are deemed necessary to achieve the goal of the policy sciences by purposively crafting and implementing target-specific plans and programs for positive societal change.

Social marketing (soc mar) and social mobilization (soc mob) are utilized to facilitate development (Velasco, Cadiz, and Lumanta, 1999). Development, as defined by Gonzales (n.d.), is &quot;a quest for an improved quality of life for all.&quot; Moreover, Gonzales (n.d.) describes development as multidimensional (possesses political, economic, social, cultural, institutional, and environmental dimensions), multidisciplinary (draws from various disciplines), interdisciplinary (derives comprehensive, strategic, and operational plans for implementation from relationships between and among disciplines), and integrative (unifies diverse orientation to allow inter-penetration among disciplines).
Therefore, the mobilization of people and resources is essential in the quest for development. &quot;True development is people oriented and participatory, bringing about people empowerment. It uses technology in harmony with the environment. It aims to be relevant, responsive, effective, efficient, economical, equitable, and sustainable&quot; (Gonzales in Velasco, Cadiz, and Lumanta, 1999).

===== Social marketing versus social mobilization =====
Social marketing uses different strategies to market social ideas and values that aim to create a change in behavior. Whereas, social mobilization has a much broader scope and it encompasses social marketing and communication. Social mobilization aims to bring together individuals and groups in spreading awareness about a certain cause using social marketing strategies. Social marketing is implemented when an advocacy/cause/message needs to be crafted in a way that it will effectively reach certain groups of people or target markets.

Kotler and Zaltman (in McKee, 1992) define social marketing as &quot;the design, implementation, and control of program calculated to influence the acceptability of social ideas, involving considerations of product, pricing, communications, and market research.&quot; On the other hand, McKee (1992) described social mobilization as &quot;the process of bringing together all feasible and practical inter-sectoral and social allies to raise people&#x27;s awareness of the demand for a particular development program, to assist in the delivery of resources and services, and to strengthen community participation for sustainability and self reliance.&quot;

===== Social marketing hand-in-hand with social mobilization =====
Social marketing and social mobilization combined creates a more powerful movement as both elements strengthen each other. Social mobilization prompts the use of social marketing strategies to attain the main objectives of a program. Likewise, social marketing intensifies social mobilization as it upholds a people-centered approach in putting together activities through the use of different media, in achieving the development goal. As an illustration, the interplay of social marketing and social mobilization is manifested in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs of different organizations.

==== Strategic communication for sustainable development ====
&quot;Communication is a key factor to begin and keep a proper Sustainable Development strategy&quot; (Bucur and Petra, 2011). Development Communication can be defined as a &quot;dialogue-based process entailing the strategic application of communication approaches, methods and/or technologies for social change&quot;. This definition highlights the three important features of development communication – process, analytical activity based on dialogue, and aims to achieve change. Strategic Communication is essential in encouraging public participation and achieving effective policy making. It affects goal setting, decision making, development and implementation, and impact assessment. However, communication as a strategic tool remains deficient in development programs creating the need to establish an Interest Group on Strategic Communication for Sustainable Development. Strategic communication &quot;aims at the innovative and sustainable change of practices, behaviors and lifestyles, guides communication processes and media interventions within and among social groups&quot;.
An effective strategy for sustainable development integrates the vision and action plan of the government, civil society and the private sector. The World Bank views development communication as the &quot;integration of strategic communication in development projects&quot; based on a clear understanding of indigenous realities. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency is now recognizing the value of implementing strategic communication to support development initiatives. This is aligned with the long tradition of strategic communication initiatives used in development projects related to human rights, democracy, poverty alleviation and health aimed at generating awareness, promoting behavioral changes, affording mobilization, and creating partnerships to reach common goals.

==== Gender ====

Development communication efforts, along with other development strategies, have failed to improve the conditions of women on a global scale, and when compared with men, women are disproportionately subject to poverty, illiteracy, domestic violence, discrimination, and barriers to senior professional positions, even in development organizations (Harbour &amp; Twist, 1996). As a group that is marginalized from global, national, and community power structures, Wilkins (1999) contends that women tend to constitute a target more often than a participant in the production of development communication. Moore (1995) estimated that &quot;gender&quot; made its &quot;first discursive appearance&quot; in development institutions during the 1960s (p. 43). However, it was not until 1975 that women&#x27;s contributions to the development process were formally acknowledged by the United Nations (UN). The mid-1970s marked a shift in attention to women in development, along with other critical transitions in the field of development communication (Rogers, 1976; Schramm &amp; Lerner, 1976). A WID strategy advocated including women as an explicit focus in order to achieve development goals (Dagenais &amp; Piché, 1994). In 1975, WID was placed on a global agenda when the UN sponsored a conference in Mexico City to launch the Year of Women. This facilitated the designation of the Decade for the Advancement of Women (1976 until 1985). As a discourse, WID served to organize principles for the production of knowledge about women by states, institutions, and communities (Escobar, 1995, p. 210). WID construed women as actively contributing to society through their economic production and human reproduction (Staudt, 1985). WID also pointed to a need to improve women&#x27;s access to education, employment, and political participation (Valdivia, 1996), conditions considered in earlier models of modernization that tended to privilege male constituents. Throughout the Decade for the Advancement of Women however, several scholars recognized limits to using media to promote social change, such as problematic stereotypes of women in media texts, a lack of women&#x27;s employment in positions of power in media industries, and poor access to mediated technologies as a source of information, particularly among rural women.
Following the Decade for Women, attention to WID gradually shifted toward a concern with gender and development (GAD). This shift from &quot;women&quot; to &quot;gender&quot; resonates with an understanding of gender as a socially constructed category, rather than essentializing sex as a biological condition (Dagenais &amp; Piché, 1994). GAD attempted to position women as active agents of social change situated within social and structural systems of patriarchy and power (Dagenais &amp; Piché, 1994). Steeves (1993) drew attention to critical scholarship about the political economy of communication and participatory approaches to development (Freire, 1983) to propose the creation of a global, imagined feminist community that challenges power relations. A &quot;global feminist&quot; approach to development would critique what appears to be defining gender according to reproductive capacity in a way that promotes motherhood as a universal role for women, rather than celebrating diversity in women&#x27;s intentions, experiences, backgrounds, and capabilities.

Hooda and Singh (2012) note that the most significant and longest social movement continuing is the movement for the emancipation of women. However, the primary goal for women empowerment is to improve the quality of life of women, but also has deep ramifications in social, economic and political scenario of body polity. It is such contentions that stressing the need to recognize power dimensions within women&#x27;s domestic, professional, and social contexts, GAD proponents would advocate interventions designed to change structures or norms.

Development communication activity embodies models of social change that are implemented across political and cultural boundaries wherein, issues of gender, communication, and development are grounded in global structures and processes of power, which condition access to and acquisition of economic and social resources. Watkins (1999) notes that in as much as critical scholars have described the global domination of media systems by Western and corporate agencies, gender also factors into this equation, as the extensive documentation of the tendency of media industries to trivialize women&#x27;s roles and concerns has been historically demonstrated (van Zoonen, 1994). Early scholars of development communication did not explicitly address the role of gender in their discussions of media and modernity (Watkins, 1999, p. 48). However, an examination of their work illustrates implicit assumptions made about men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s roles in the development process. There is thus a need to understand the dynamics contributing to the institutional construction of gender within development communication strategies designed to alleviate social problems. Watkins (1999) cites Steeves (1993) whose summary of feminist scholarship concluded that, among other areas, research is needed &quot;on women&#x27;s roles and representations in Third World development communication activities, including funding agency projects&quot; (p. 120). Along with integrating regional, national, and/or organizational perspectives, one specific tool for policymakers is ensuring that gender perspective is incorporated into policies. Regardless whether gender plays a central role in a development communication policy, the policy-making process has to be taken in a deliberate way to address concerns of both women and men. When views of different groups of women and men in policy formation and delivery are taken accordingly, misjudging of the different effects on each group, and the systems and organizations that support them can be avoided.

In a quest to ensure that the overall legal and policy framework is promoting gender equality, more than just adopting laws that explicitly provide for gender equality can be done. Thus it is essential that all laws and policies reflect gender equality considerations, through a process called gender mainstreaming. Gender mainstreaming is the mechanism to ensure a gender-sensitive approach to policy making.

Gender mainstreaming, according to the United Nations, is a globally accepted strategy for promoting gender equality. Mainstreaming is not an end in itself but a strategy, an approach, a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. Mainstreaming involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities—policy development, research, advocacy/ dialogue, legislation, resource allocation, and planning, implementation and monitoring of programmes and projects. A strong, continued commitment to gender mainstreaming is one of the most effective means for the United Nations to support promotion of gender equality at all levels—in research, legislation, policy development and in activities on the ground, and to ensure that women as well as men can influence, participate in and benefit from development efforts.

United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund or UNICEF also promotes gender sensitivity in its policies. UNICEF gender review ensures that gender is mainstreamed in all UNICEF&#x27;s projects and programs as well as in its work with partners. UNICEF also ensures that the monitoring and evaluation tools are gender sensitive and that every staff is aware of the UN Code of conduct. UNICEF also uses the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGAD) as a tool to promote gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment in the development and implementation of projects.

The communication approach embedded within empowerment models combines the use of appropriate media. This means using a variety of channels ranging from indigenous media, local and international media systems. (Einsiedel 1996).

==== Demography ====
Defined as the statistical study of populations, Demography is seen as more of a general science that can analyze populations that show change over a period of time. However, in combination with the more specific aspect of communication that has to do with social sciences, demographics can be a significant factor and consequently influencer of Development Communication policy design. Population changes are brought about by birth, migration and mortality. These demographic processes affect the use of resources, nation-building and society formation, and cultural development calling for development communication policies.

Researcher for the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research Sebastian Klüsener &quot;investigated how the exchange of ideas and information between people could affect the development of spatial, temporal, and social differences in demographic change. The results highlight that communication plays a much larger role in shaping demographic processes...&quot; In her discussion of the relationship between communicators and their audiences, Natalie T. J. Tindall, an associate professor in the department of communication at Georgia State University, US, shares &quot;Demographic categories can still tell us a lot about our social structure, and continue to be useful for macro-level understandings of people and societies.&quot; It is with this understanding that policies can be designed more tailor-fit to those it is designed for.
Furthermore, the criterion by which a demography is performed are relevant factors that may act as a roadmap that can guide development communication policy making. This includes but is not limited to age, level of education, gender distribution profile, individual and household income, etc. With the anticipatory objective of policy sciences in relation to crisis or problem solving, the better policy makers get a grasp of how a population is demographically—not just socially—the more sensitive and pro-active policy making as a process can be. When perspectives of an accurate cross-sectional sampling of a population, group, or culture are taken into consideration, the ensuing policies are better geared towards the pre-set objectives. Scalone, Dribe, and Klusener have further found that &quot;Communication can significantly increase the impact of population-relevant policies and other processes of social change...&quot; which reinforces the idea that as a science in itself, development communication policy design, becomes more accurate and purposeful when the correct information and variables are holistically integrated.

==== Selected approaches to communication planning for policy development ====
UNESCO or the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization is one of the multilateral organizations that uses communication planning for policy development. In one of its publications back in 1980 &quot;Approaches to Communication Planning,&quot; where it presents some of the most common approaches that scholars, planners and professionals to use. Below are common approaches to communication planning.

==== Process approach ====
The process approach deals directly with the communication planning process which deals to the theories within the planning process that asserts that planning is the application of theory on how and why they are used. (UNESCO, 1980) The second is it deals with the planning process itself that provide alternative ways of organizing the planning function and process, given different purposes and planning contexts. (UNESCO, 1980) The thrust of the argument is that there are alternatives to the widely known rational/comprehensive planning approach (UNESCO, 1980).

Communication policy makers are not acting in isolation; they had the full support of scientist and theorists. Communication for Development aims at upholding change in people&#x27;s attitudes and behavior so as to increase their participation in the development process. Rogers&#x27; diffusion of innovations theory is perhaps the most influential theory in the modernization paradigm. The diffusion model gained wide currency in most developing nations and still looms large with the agenda to support &#x27;development&#x27; by &quot;informing the populations about the development projects, illustrating their advantages and recommending that they be supported&quot;(Servaes, 1996). Communication within the modernization approach is synonymous to information and ignores the importance of feedback in the communication process. Melkote and Steeves (2001) contributed three key qualities of modernization theory and practice: blaming the victim, Social Darwinism, and sustaining class structure of inequality. (1) Blaming the victim is an ideological process, an almost painless circumvention among policy-makers and intellectual all over the world. It is a process of justifying inequality in society by finding defects in the victims of inequality. The policymakers simply blame the despondent lives led by the poor in Third World countries and it is being attributed to the lack of motivation and access to information relating to the various social and economic aspects that they need in order to redeem themselves. (2) Social Darwinists believed that government interventions on behalf of the poor would have disastrous results since they would interfere with the laws of natural selection. The theorist believed that outside interventions to address matters concerning the poor would have dreadful results since these would be interfering with a natural course of events and individual choices and rights. (3) Sustaining class structure of inequality, this is a capitalist interest and quite difficult to overcome. The effect of a focus on individual level cultural deficiencies has been to sustain the status quo within and between unequal societies and thus delay change.

===== Systems approach =====

The systems approach in communication planning deals on how to establish new systems within organizations (UNESCO, 1980). This approach is valuable to planners faced with the task of setting up organizational systems to carry out communication functions (UNESCO, 1980). This approach can also be best applied to problems in the environment, providing planners with an analytical perspective on problem analysis and a range of techniques to use in implementing this perspective (UNESCO, 1980).

===== Network approach =====

Network approach (Padovani &amp; Pavan, 2014) is a heuristic framework for theorizing and empirically investigating global communication governance (GCG) environments or networks in supranational settings characterized by plurality and multiplicity of agents, actors and stakeholders, plurality and diversity of cultures, complexity of interactions, plurality of political systems, and multiplicity of policy processes. GCG is a term coined by Padovani &amp; Pavan (2014) to &quot;indicate the multiplicity of networks of interdependent but operationally autonomous actors that are involved with different degrees of autonomy and power, in processes of formal or informal character, through which they pursue different goals, produce relevant knowledge and cultural practices, and engage in political negotiation while trying to influence the outcome of decision-making in the domain of media and communication in transnational context&quot; (p. 544). Network approach specifically focuses on the transnational dynamics that govern communication systems.

===== Policy life cycle =====

Government officials and policy makers in both developed and developing countries are often confronted with problems for which they have no design solutions. Every problem, country and culture requires a specific approach and seems to go through policy life cycle. Winsemius proposed four phases of policy cycle;
Phase 1: Recognizing the problem; groups in the society such as government official, lobbyists and countries&#x27; leaders recognize the problem, e.g. terrorism, poverty, global warming, and other. The problem is made known to all stakeholders, during this stage the members realized that problem should be tackled through policy.
Phase 2: Gaining Control over the Problem; at this point, the government start to advance in their mechanisms through the formulation of policies. Policy oriented research is often appointed to scientific institutions, opinion surveys are piloted, and options for improving and solving the problem are accounted.
Phase 3: Solving the Problem; at this stage, policies, programs and projects are implemented. In most cases, the government will manage all the details of a program by itself but the best scenario is when NGOs and other involved groups participate in the initiatives.
Phase 4: Monitoring the Problem: At this point the focus is to ensure that the problem is under control and must remain so. This is also the time to think about future policies and to develop public and private partnerships in implementing policies.

==== Interdisciplinary research for policy and practice ====
Policy analysis has traditionally followed a linear model – problem identification, policy formulation, legislation, implementation, evaluation, and iteration. However, in solving complex socio-economic problems, a more interdisciplinary approach to societal problems may be more effective particularly for research topics of interdisciplinary nature (e.g., women&#x27;s studies, environment) or those relevant to policy or strategic issues – drawing from different disciplines to enhance understanding of particular issues or for concept development. The main interest of interdisciplinary research for policy and practice is description, prediction, and ultimately social action. In interdisciplinary research, different disciplines interact and work together at each and every stage of the research process – from conceptualisation, research design and methodology, data analysis and interpretation into policy development.

==== Methods in communication policy analysis ====
Ongkiko and Flor (2006) argue that a development communication specialist (DCS), at one time or another, also assumes the role of a communication policy analyst in Communication Policy Analysis &#x27;because of his proactive posture and his preoccupation with purpose&#x27; (Flor, 1991). Remember that policy sciences anticipates, and looks forward, thus, substantiates the proactive nature of a DCS. In order to fully act out this role, there is a need for a rudimentary knowledge of methods in policy analysis, particularly those related to development communication. Among these methods are discussed below:

===== Communication technology assessment (CTA) =====
Communication plays a vital role in project coordination, management, knowledge collection and transfer among different project shareholders (Malone &amp; Crowston, 1994; Espinosa &amp; Carmel, 2003, as cited by Gill, Bunker, &amp; Seltsikas, 2012). CTA is a qualitative method that seeks to determine the higher and lower order impacts of specific forms of communication technology on the individual and society (Flor, 1991) prior to the adoption of new technology (Ongkiko &amp; Flor, 2006). The decision to adopt or not depends on the findings of the assessment. CTA is forward-looking and adopts certain value premises on what is socially beneficial or detrimental to society. Being anticipatory in nature, CTA forecasts, at least on a probabilistic basis, the full spectrum of possible consequences of technological advance, leaving to the political process the actual choice among the alternative policies in the light of the best available knowledge of their likely consequences (Brooks, 1976, as cited by Ely, Zwanenberg, &amp; Stirling, 2010). In this case, it should provide an unbiased analysis and information concerning the physical, biological, economic, social, and political effects of [communication] technologies.

===== Cost-Benefit Analysis =====
Introduced by Jules Dupuit in the 1840s, French engineer and economist, the cost benefit analysis is a methodology used in policy analysis as a way of weighing up projects costs and benefits, to determine whether to go ahead with a project.

Beyea (1999), identifies the types of cost analysis used in policy making to aid decision process. These are: Cost-Benefit analysis, Cost-effectiveness, cost-utilization and cost utility.

===== Social cost-benefit analysis =====
Pathak (n.d.) explains that Social Cost Benefit Analysis (SCBA) is also referred to as Economic Analysis (EA). SCBA or EA is a feasibility study of a project from the viewpoint of a society to evaluate whether a proposed project will add benefit or cost to the society (Ibid.). Ongkiko and Flor (2006) further elaborate that SCBA is a quantitative method which attaches monetary values on social conditions brought by certain communication policies. Flor (1991) explains the monetary value of the social costs is subtracted from the social benefits of a particular program or policy. A positive difference is required for a program or policy to be adjudged as socially beneficial. The purpose of SCBA is to assist public decision-making, not in terms of producing the ideal project but simply by proposing the optimum solution for the community out of the spectrum of possibilities (Dupuis, 1985). Hence, the objective is to determine optimum quantities as a contribution to decision-making or to evaluate the effectiveness of decisions already taken.

===== Problematique analysis =====
The problematique analysis procedure is a naturalistic approach that seeks to discover the influential factors and describe the structure of problems that exist in communication systems (Librero, 1993; Flor, 1991). The basic purpose of this approach, according to Librero (1993), is to identify the problem rather than the solution. In the process, therefore, the evaluator employing problematique analysis identifies the factors that influence the system, shows the hierarchical relationships of these factors and traces the root causes of the problems of the system. Flor (1991) classified these influential factors as either &quot;subordinate&quot; or &quot;superordinate&quot;, with the former being merely the symptoms of the latter. The identification of the superordinate influential factors or the root causes, then, prevents the recurrence of the problem situation.

&quot;Problematique&quot; situation occurs when certain recurring problems come about due to the fact that symptoms are treated but not the root cause of such problems. When &#x27;superordinate influential factors&#x27;, root causes of problems, are identified and given focus, real solutions come about. This is done through a &#x27;problematic map&#x27; (Librero, 1998), perceived as basic tool for problem analysis that basically identifies the root causes which can be the bases for forming solutions.

===== Scenario construction =====
As a policy analysis tool, scenario construction (SC) describes a possible set of future conditions (Moniz, 2006) or hypothetical events that may occur in the future of a particular system (Allen, 1978, as cited by Flor, 1991). It has also been defined as a description of the conditions and events under which some system being studied is assumed to be operating (Kraemer, 1973, as cited by Flor, 1991). Scenarios provide an educated description of one of many possible futures of a system, usually presented at the most optimistic or &quot;best-case&quot; state and the most pessimistic or &quot;worst-case&quot; state. According to Moniz (2006), the most useful scenarios are those that display the conditions of important variables over time. In this approach, the quantitative underpinning enriches the narrative evolution of conditions or evolution of variables; narratives describe the important events and developments that shape the variables. In terms of innovative methods for policy analysis, the foresight and scenario construction methods can be an interesting reference for social sciences (Moniz, 2006). Citing Allen (1978), Flor (1991) enumerates six steps in scenario construction, namely: (1) defining the system; (2) establishing a time period for the system to operate; (3) defining the external constraints on the environment of the system; (4) defining the elements or events within the system that are likely to increase or decrease the chances of the system&#x27;s meeting its goals and objectives; (5) stating in probabilistic terms the likelihood of the occurrence of the elements or events; and (6) conducting a sensitive analysis of the results.

===== Policy Delphi =====
The Policy Delphi, according to Flor (1991), is a variation of the Delphi technique. It is a tool for the analysis of policy issues seeking the involvement and participation of anonymous respondents (usually representatives of the different stakeholders of the policy). Herein, the desirability and feasibility of certain policies are assessed from the points of view of the different stakeholders. Meanwhile, according to Turoff (1975), the policy Delphi aims to create the best possible contrasting insights to resolve a major policy problem. Herein, the decision maker is interested on having a group that will give him options and supporting evidences where he can choose from for him to make a solution, rather than having a group that will produce the decision for him. &quot;The Policy Delphi is, then, a tool for the analysis of policy issues and not a mechanism for making a decision&quot; (Turoff, 1975). Turoff (1975) notes the challenging nature of policy Delphi as a means for policy analysis, &quot;both for the design team and for the respondents&quot; (Turoff, 1975). As a process, the policy Delphi undergoes the following six phases: (1) Formulating the issue; (2) Citing options; (3) Deciding preliminary stance about the issue; (4) Searching and getting reasons for disputes; (5) Assessing the underlying reasons; (6) Reassessing the options.

As a methodology, Delphi is used for structuring a group communication process so that the process is effective in allowing a group of individuals, as a whole, to deal with a complex problem. As mentioned, one of the advantages of this technique is the involvement of stakeholders in the analysis which is imperatively instrumental in building a consensus among people who will be/are affected by the policy/project. In the Philippines, this has also been well applied in a study conducted by Dr. Alexander Flor and Dr. Felix Librero in the Southeast Asian Needs Assessment for a Global Open Agriculture and Food University. Recently, Haynes, Palermo and Reidlinger(2016) adopted a Delphi modified technique(James Lind Alliance Approach) in their study in exploring obesity prevention in Australia.

Flor (1991) emphasizes the incorporation of divergent stakeholders in communication policy making. That the State is not a lone actor in the creation of public policies as noted by the various stakeholders identified by Flor (1991), attesting to the fact that State actions do not occur in an empty space. Consumer involvement to policy making can therefore of paramount importance in helping create relevant policies vis-à-vis Gatung&#x27;s (1979) postulation of policies promoting &quot;&quot;horizontalization&quot; where exchanges occur between the centers and peripheries &quot;on more equal terms&quot;.&quot; In this regard, employing appropriate methods in policy research such would be necessary in &#x27;light of the diversity of stakeholders involved, there is a possibility to broaden the scope of &#x27;expertise&#x27; to share opinion across diverse perspectives including local communities&#x27; (Haynes, et al., 2016). Employing the Modified Policy-Delphi technique to crafting an all-inclusive communication policy include the following jusutification:
* The Policy-Delphi technique ability to explore consensus and dissent, rather than aiming to achieve consensus,
* As a flexible technique, it can be applied to various situations to map overlapping priorities from different perspectives and identify mutual priorities across stakeholder groups and therefore is a valuable exercise for investigating complex public issues
* The technique facilitates an in-depth investigation which may detect limitations, considerations and consequences of policy options which may enhance the value and success of policy implementation.
* The diversity of stakeholders involved makes reaching consensus on priorities less feasible but where mapping perspectives may identify mutual concepts behind the most agreeable options to inform future research and practice.
* The technique provides an opportunity for participants to contribute equally, and offers additional options and comments throughout; in this respect, it gives all participants, including consumers, a voice in the complex debate [equity in &#x27;Voices&#x27;]
The methodology outlined in Haynes et al. (2016) paper align with Servaes (1986) reference to the application of Participatory Communication (Research) from a Freirean Perspective by positing that for dialectical and emancipatory process of action and reflection that constitutes the &quot;process of &quot;conscientization,&quot; where an agenda instead of defined by an academic elite and programs enacted by a bureaucratic elite for the benefit of an economic or political elite, participatory research involves people gaining an understanding of their situation, confidence and an ability to change that situation&quot; (Servaes, 1986). Therefore, the notion of Participatory Communication stresses the importance of cultural identity of local communities, and of democratisation and participation at all levels – international, national, local and individual. It points to a strategy, not merely inclusive of, but largely emanating from, the traditional &#x27;receivers&#x27;. However one needs not to romanticize the use of such &#x27;equity&#x27; methods. Sarveas(1986) had outlined the following caution:
* Participatory research can all too easily be utilized as yet another tool of manipulation by vested interests.
* While the approach strives towards empowerment, challenges existing structures, and is consequently ideological, rigidly prescribed ideologies must be avoided
* In addition, knowledge and perspective gained may well empower exploitative economic and authoritarian interests instead of local groups.
* Far from helping the process of liberation, if the researcher is not careful, he or she may only enable the traditional policy-makers and vested interests to present their goods in a more attractive package.
* Even the best intentioned researcher/activist can inadvertently enhance dependency rather than empowerment. If she/he enters communities with ready-made tools for analyzing reality, and solving problems, the result will likely be that as far as those tools are successful, dependency will simply be moved from one tyrant to another&quot;.

===== Simulations and modelling =====
Simulations and modelling recently become a useful tool policy analysis involving computers and software in creating a virtual representation of the scenario. Because it offers a systems view of the situation, the analyst or researcher can monitor how the players or variables interacts in the simulated environment. The purposes of simulations may vary to include education, research, design improvement and/or the exploration of the probable effect of different policy decisions.

Guyonne Kalbe(2004) identifies and distinguishes two types of simulation models: macro and micro levels. According to Kalbe, the macro-level is applied mostly for huge sectors of the industries. This macro simulation is usually applied by developed countries in order to assess and understand policy changes. On the other hand, the micro-level is used for a specific company using a sample of population when a need for more precised and focused information is its goal. In contrast to large-scale industries that use the macro-level approach, the micro-level is individualized.

Since problems in policy decisions are not linear by nature, computer simulations provides a concrete view of the situation and how the variables changes pace. These changes in behaviors are integral in developing policies. Steven Bankes(1992) explicates the use of computer simulation in policy decisions wherein models used in policy analysis provide arguments to illuminate options for policy decisions based on the result of computer simulated analysis.

The methodology has been successfully used in development projects. Thorngate &amp; Tavakoli(2009) mention fields where computer simulations has aided decision makers in assessing the context and solutions to specific problems. Among these include: the climate changes, effects of fiscal changes in economic policies, traffic regulations, health allocation resources, air regulations and crisis management to name a few.

It is noted that simulations and modelling could be based on artificial data generating process (DGP) or real live data from the environment for analysis. The real data derived from the environment is often called &quot;big data&quot; due to the significantly larger size. This is especially critical in the development communication discussion when there is prevalent use of digital communication technology in low and middle income countries (Taylor &amp; Schroeder, 2015). The technologies in these countries include mobile phones and notebooks. These technologies emit data as a byproduct and have great potential to fill some of the problematic gaps encountered by country policy makers and international development organizations. There is research indicating that the use of big data represents an important complement to country level statistics (Taylor &amp; Schroeder, 2015)., better water quality modelling (Korfmacher, 1998) and improved agricultural development (WESTERVELT, 2001).

The use of big data can ensure a more accurate measurement of macro-economic data such as price track. The Billion Prices Project (BPP) initiated by MIT&#x27;s Sloan School of Management challenges the Argentina government on the misleading inflation index report. It reported by very high inflation rate by the government&#x27;s statistical institute which led to the fire of all government officials in the department a few years later. The actual inflation rate after the lay-off eventually stabilizes. The group in MIT decided to investigate what is going on by programming a web scraper to find prices for everyday goods posted on the web by the country&#x27;s supermarkets. It scrapes many data on the web and is a financially affordable experiment. The outcome of the result led to an increased suspicion that Argentina&#x27;s statistical agency was under pressure to level off inflation rate by higher order authority. The BPP proves to be influential because it produced an inflation index that was more intuitively reflective of perceptions and in real society than the government. It also provides an alternative set of perspective on economic trends which policymakers can use to make prudent finance policy decisions. There is an increasing need for major governments in the world to rethink how development statistics should be collated in order to craft better and finer public policy.

The simulation approach in policy science is beneficial to policy coherence on the sustainable development goals commonly called SDGs. The SGDs developed by United Nations has integrative nature which is suitable for integrative modelling techniques (Collste et al., 2017). Collste and the researchers have shown in a Tanzania experiment that modelling approach towards SGDs can bring interlinks to the forefront and facilitate a shift to a discussion on development grounded in systems thinking. It brings the multitudes of possible feedback loops that shape a country&#x27;s development especially those in developing country. The modelling approach in SDGs maps interlinkages and provide analysis about the resulting behaviour of different policy decisions. It also provide new casual pathways on investments in public projects.

==== Applications of policy sciences to context-specific developmental policy issues ====

===== Environmental assessment =====
The policy sciences are highly relevant in environmental impact assessments (EIA) and large-scale environmental change modeling. One example is the use of scenario-making in the study by Garb, Pulver, and VanDeveer (2008). Using storyline driven modeling, they sought to understand the impacts of human activities on natural systems. The said study departs from the increasingly technical approach to scenario analysis. Instead, they drew concept and methodologies from science and technology studies, sociology, and political science. Policy-making is multi-method, and in this case, multi-disciplinary. In this study&#x27;s framework, scenario is said to be able to &quot;co-produce knowledge and social order by facilitating collaboration between scientific and technical experts of various types and policy-makers and other non-scientists, as together they &#x27;make sense&#x27; of aspects of the natural world and aspects of social interaction (their own and that of societies at large).&quot; The intertwined relationship between development communication and policy sciences is affirmed because the study recommends including more representatives of social science professionals in global environmental scenario teams, and creating fora with their active involvement, as well.

In recent years, international-funding agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank has recognised the potential of EIA as an opportunity for dialogue between and among project stakeholders (Flor, 2004).

Flor posits that though the EIA is generally regarded as a regularly and management tool, it should also be regarded as a communication process that seeks to achieve mutual understanding—the overall purpose of development communication and for that matter, environmental communication programs. This mutual understanding would translate to societal environmental consciousness.
Development communication as a discipline grew as a response to some of the most pressing problems of underdevelopment including environment and resources degradation. Environmental communication programs are logically subsumed under development communication.

Citing five case studies of the use of communication and social mobilisation in environmental protection and natural resources management programs, Flor laid out the following lessons learned from the five programs:

# Effective environment communication is not merely instructive nor consultative.
# Effective environmental communication is not merely informative either.
# Participation and collective action is internally driven, not externally imposed.
# Environmental communication should make use of indigenous media.
# Environment communication should be done on an interpersonal level as well as on a community level, and further on a national level.
# Participation takes time; effective communication proceeds at its own pace.
# Effective environment communication assumes a momentum of its own.

Transformational Communication Approach in Chaotic Environment

Development communication policies on environment take on approaches expected to create good environment practices. A particular approach that aims for the conversion of the heart and mind is Transformational Communication. This communication model is the answer to failed environment programs, especially the top-down strategy and those that target only behavior change (Flor and Smith, 1997).

Mooney (2017) views Transformational Communication superior to other communication types which simply passes information (transactional) and purpose (transformative) on a rational level. He defines Transformational as transfer of meanings to achieve emotional connection. The International Environmental Communication Association explains that meanings and values influence how people relate to nature and environment. It also asserts that sustainable ecology entails changes in human culture. Thus, ethical and effective communication helps usher in necessary cultural adjustments to solve ecological crisis (Meisner, 2015).

For Flor &amp; Smith (1997), this value-laden or normative approach of Transformational Communication paradigm makes it more effective than other modes in addressing the highly unstable or chaotic biogeopysical components of the environment system. The Butterfly Effect for example shows that just a little stimuli (flapping of a butterfly wings) can suddenly make a fine weather turbulent. 
In the area of communication, this chaotic field is populated with numerous friendly and unfriendly behaviors toward the environment. Interventions for each behavior may not be feasible, and solutions for only a few might also be fragmented. Flor &amp; Smith(1997) advise that focusing on norms that direct environment-friendly behaviors is the key intervention in complex ecology.

Flor &amp; Smith (1997) offers three substantive areas of the normative approach: Environmental Literacy, Environmental Ethics, and Environmental Advocacy geared for massive social transformation. According to Flor &amp; Smith (1997), these three areas in Transformational Communication operate as institutional or network level, process-driven social learning which initiates values formation, and strategic by working with specific leaders and policy makers key to the mobilization of the critical mass in environment revolution.

====Establishing Trust in Internal Communication====

According to Kennan and Hazleton (2006) in their theory of internal public relations, they said that effective communication is based on social capital. Social capital is the ability of the organization to achieve desirable organizational goals, which could be through employee satisfaction, commitment, productivity and customer satisfaction. Shockley-Zalabak et al. (2000) argued that trust is a social capital. Sockley-Zalabak&#x27;s found that trust is linked to lower incidents of litigation and legislation. It also directly affects an organization&#x27;s ability to deal with change and crisis. They also found that trust influences job satisfaction, productivity and team building.

Corporate communication policies are essential in sustaining an organization. It can make or break your business and thus have to be explicitly communicated especially when dealing with complex issues and rapid changes in a turbulent market.

====Policy science as catalyst instrument for environmental communication towards development====

Policy science is the bedrock in developing environmental and social movement to address immense issue and predicament regarding environmental depletion and societal development. However, there are three components to be considered when addressing about the issue and talking about development (economy, environment, and society). The most prevalent phenomenon bound to become increasingly imperative through the ongoing dual process of economic-cum-ecological globalization wherein the process of constructing policies for sustainable development is essential. The concept of &quot;policy science&quot; plays a central role in the development; therefore, the incorporation and synchronization of communication and policy science in tackling the challenges encountered is valuable. The communicators are critical contributors to societal development and environmental sustainability wherein the basis could be aided as the framework for policy analysis and policy construction. At these science-policy interfaces, policymakers, communicators and other key stakeholders are supposed to interact on a constant basis.

Development with emphasis on environmental communication instrument guided by the policy science is a trending topic. Indeed, the consideration of environmental communication in developing policy to handle the enduring distresses act as catalyst for policy makers to unravel protuberant concern. Numerous countries that have developed or are developing when surfacing about the environment is essentially crucial as the development that is being misguided by the policy science will lead to a plethora of environmental crisis. Therefore, policy creation in fostering environmental communication is vital as it has significantly contributed to the totality growth of economy and serve as a platform to raise key questions that positively helpful in decision making. Environmental communication, defined as &quot;... the medium that we use in constructing environmental problems and negotiating communities different responses to them. The development of environmental policy instruments at the national level has a positive influence on environmental management at other levels and all sectors. However, the requirement in developing &quot;environmental communication instrument&quot; is essential to lay the foundation for the framework to understand the environmental communication policy science in stimulating for development into top-down stream from national level. Communication in the environmental sector that is primarily formally regulated by access to information and participation legal acts, has great potential, if an immense variety of well-developed and continuously emerging new environmental communication forms represented by different sectors and target groups, are utilized for the common goal of sustainable development. However, these will become successful when communicators, policy makers, and key stakeholders can effectively convey their messages to each other and build mutual trust based on a set of co-constructed knowledge. Setting policy to promote environmental communication for development is essential. However, understanding environmental communication instruments especially the broad spectrum of technical content and social consideration to lever the consequences should not be deserted.

===== Governance =====
In a study by Hilbert, Miles, and Othmer (2009), a five-round Delphi exercise was conducted to show how &quot;international foresight exercises, through online and offline tools, can make policy-making in developing countries more participatory, fostering transparency and accountability of public decision-making&quot;. Policy science was used to identify future priorities with regard to the 2005–2007 Latin American and Caribbean Action Plan for the Information Society (eLAC2007). The paper presented specific policy guidance, and explained how Policy [null Delphi] methods can be applied to make public decision-making more transparent and accountable, particularly in developing countries. Practical implications drawn include 1) &quot;the governments&#x27; acknowledgement of the value of collective intelligence from civil society, academic and private sector participants of the Delphi and the ensuing appreciation of participative policy-making&quot; and 2) &quot;the role that can be played by the United Nations (and potentially by other inter-governmental agencies) in international participatory policy-making in the digital age, especially if they modernize the way they assist member countries in developing public policy agendas&quot;.

Issues and Challenges of Development Communication and Policy Science

Although the field of development communication has been present as early as the 1950s, Waisbord (2005) mentioned that it faces two sets of challenges. The first set of challenges has something to do with the critical aspects of development projects: scale and sustainability. The first challenge asks how a small-scale project and its effects in a locally based community be replicated to the national level. On the other hand, sustainability refers to community projects that have a long-lasting impact. It asks the questions about how long will the impact of the project take effect?. The second set of challenges focuses on the specific issues of communication. This concentrates on bridging the divide between &#x27;small&#x27; and &#x27;big&#x27; media and looking at their contribution towards development communication.

Servaes and Lie (2014) also outlined the main challenges for the field of communication for development:
#The differences between good governance and good government and the issues of transparency and accountability. 
#The complexity of the participatory concept. 
#Participation taking place at different levels.
#The reinforcement of independent and pluralistic media.
#Not making full use of potential radio.
#Enabling policy and resources.
#Implementing a legal and supportive framework favoring the right to free expression and the emergence of free and pluralistic information systems.
#Building alliances
#New global partnerships are necessary with the media, development agencies, universities, and governments.

===== Distance education =====
In the book &quot;Beyond Access and Equity: Distance Learning Models in Asia&quot;, Flor (2002) details the case of SMP Terbuka, a junior secondary education in Indonesia delivered in distance learning mode. This is in consonance with the country&#x27;s pursuit of the Universalization of Basic Education. In assessing the socio-cultural environment of SMP Terbuka and in determining the policy environment for distance learning, environmental scanning was done. The study also used the problematique method to analyze structural-organizational problems in a distance learning system, along with their causes. Overall, a systems analysis approach was employed where the environment, the stakeholders, the organization cum network, and problem structure were analyzed. Flor proceeds with a proposed communication and advocacy plan for SMP Terbuka aimed at eliciting public support to this alternative education mode. In designing the social marketing and advocacy blueprint, situation analysis was used. This employed four methods, namely, &quot;environmental scanning, communication resources assessment; review of existing communication strategies; and strategic impact analysis directed at sector stakeholders&quot;.

===== Health reforms =====
Walt and Gilson (1994) emphasized the central role of policy analysis in health reforms in developing countries. In their study, they argue that health policy narrowly focuses on the content of reform, and neglects other crucial considerations such as the context that calls for such reform, the processes involved, and the social actors or the stakeholders associated with the reform.
Bernardo (2017) has considered that care policies are not the same globally. It has been recommended to create four complementary offices to standardize what is right or wrong to all patients as well as contribute to establishing the key strategies and priorities of the national policy. This includes the managerial office in evidence-based medicine, evidence-generation offices, evidence-implementation offices, and conflict-arbitration offices.

Community Health

The underlying principles of development communication have had significant impact on various levels of policy planning. A UNICEF commissioned report by Galway, for example, cited that there was a large communication initiative in Bangladesh where a national information campaign was launched to raise awareness of villagers on arsenic in drinking water. In his report, &quot;top-down health education models are being replaced with more participatory approaches;&quot; an approach which development communication features as a more effective methodology than linear models of communication. Schiavo also noted that participatory processes provide a platform for health messages and interventions which communicate directly to local communities.

==== Information overload and the wastage ratio ====
Fred Fedler (1989), mentioned in the book, Dilemmas in the Study of Information: Exploring the Boundaries of Information Science, describes the impact of the Information age by referring to media&#x27;s &quot;vulnerability to hoaxes&quot;. Fedler contends &quot;journalists are vulnerable to information and will always be. Journalists cannot determine the truth to the stories they publish, nor check every details. They receive too many stories, and a single story may contain hundreds of details&quot;. In the same vein, this is what majority of the specialists posits as the information explosion.

Now more than ever, information has exceeded in millions of gigabytes. Technology has brought people around the world to be confronted with so much information that utilization of this information has now become an issue. Dr Paul Marsden of the Digital Intelligence Today defines information overload as &quot;when the volume of potentially useful and relevant information available exceeds processing capacity and becomes a hindrance rather than a help&quot; (Marsden, 2013).

Dr. Alexander Flor, in his article on the information wastage ratio, argues that although information can be consumed anytime and seldom has expiration date;

&quot;Research information is generated for a particular purpose, a specific user and a definite problem in mind. If such information is unavailable to the right person, at the right time and at the right place, then we conclude that the effort exerted to generate this amount of information has been wasted&quot;.

One approach that Flor has postulated to establish the underutilization is his information wastage ratio. The ratio takes into consideration the concepts of information generation (IG) and information utilization (IU) expressed as &quot;wastage ratio that is equivalent to one minus the amount of information utilized divided by the quantity of information generated&quot;, thus:

:Wr = 1 – IU/IG

Flor&#x27;s formula accounts for the information deficit especially, among the Third World countries, where information utilization is constrained by factors such as &quot;low literacy, limited media access and availability, low computer literacy, low levels of education and unsound communication policy&quot;.
The framework that Flor presented is best described as &quot;the communication revolution contributes to the quantity of information generated thus, information explosion happens&quot;. Since the relationship of the two phenomena is reciprocal, &quot;the quantity of information, the quality of information and the information overload determine the information wastage in an information society&quot;.
The outcome of this wastage ratio provides support for the initiation of communication policies to ensure full utilization of information in varied fields.

====Between research, development and policy====

It is a complex task to achieve effectiveness in development policy especially in rural areas. It involves a range of stakeholders who need to demonstrate coordinated action. Sunitiyoso et al. (2012) claim that holistic thinking is needed to solve public policy problems which requires collaborative efforts across different organizational boundaries. The government through its administration must show vigor and integrity to implement these programs. Development policy makers must consider providing education and sustained training in order to materialize the programs provided to the beneficiaries. Sustained training does not only rely to ICT, it also needs emotional quotient to motivate beneficiaries to get involved and develop a sense of ownership. President Julius K. Nyerere once stated that the people must participate in considering, planning, and implementing their development (in Tanganyika African National Union, 1971 ). Therefore, development can only be achieved when people develop themselves. This has been realized by not only socialist and communist nations, but also by capitalist nations such as Singapore and South Korea. Self- development is usually accompanied by social mobilization by political parties, non- government organizations and workers from the academe.

Scholars have proposed categories for the analysis of changes present in the research and policy sectors. What generates lack of accord between the effectiveness of development communication policy is the unrealized link between the importance of research and development to policy making. As compared to Europe, the United States and Latin America, the challenges of knowledge and technology transfer have been solved in the forefront of attention in economic, social and industrial policy.

=====Gap between researchers and policy makers=====
The &quot;praxis&quot; or the marriage of research and practice, according to Flor (1991) is needed to address the pressing social issues that are pestering the society. However, there are factors that delay its realization. According to UNCTAD Virtual Institute (2006), there are still a huge communication gap between researchers and policy makers. On the side of the policy makers, the information on ongoing researchers barely reaches to them. The researchers, on the other hand, lack the awareness and the knowledge on the most important policy that could contribute so much in the research. Here are some common reasons for the wide gap between the two:
Policy makers turn primarily to international organizations, international research institutes or their own technical experts or diplomatic missions to obtain information and analysis as policy inputs. Local universities and research institutes may have the capacity but are often not able to engage in cooperation with policy makers.
Policy-makers consider the credibility of researchers and research outputs a key requirement for cooperation.
Governments lack systematic procedures regarding which research institutions to turn to, and when and how to establish contact with researchers.
Data required for informed research may be non-existent or inaccessible.
Hence, the joint UNCTAD-WTO-ITC workshop on trade policy analysis workshop has forwarded these recommendations for both the research institutions and policy making bodies:

As a researcher:
Try to disseminate information about current research projects as widely as possible:
Invite concerned government officials to conferences or presentations of research, or organize specific events bringing together policy makers and researchers
Send notes and abstracts to relevant ministries
Distribute research to government agencies but also to NGOs, which might also be among its users. Be ready to discuss work in progress with policy-makers after initial contacts have been established.
Try to get in direct contact, for example with negotiators, by providing them with short notes/abstracts of relevant research findings.
Establish contact and build a long-term cooperation with relevant ministries. The start can be facilitated by having a &quot;champion&quot; in the ministry. However, the researcher/research institution may need to avoid being too closely identified with a &quot;champion&quot;, and hence, depending too much on the evolution of the &quot;champion&#x27;s&quot; status.
Access to high-ranked officials at ministries can be facilitated by involving higher-level representatives at universities (deans, vice-chancellors...) in the establishment and maintenance of contacts. However, more decentralized cooperation can also be productive if he procedures within the university tend to be very hierarchical and bureaucratic.
As a policy maker:
Involve policy-makers in research. Policy-makers who are consulted at the initial stages of a research project tend to be more open since they can actively participate and hence have a stake in shaping the research questions, and thereby take &quot;ownership&quot; of the research as well. Regular interaction during the research project can help adjusting the questions researched and the tools used to the needs of policy makers.
Make sure that your research addresses issues of policy relevance to your country by approaching permanent missions in Geneva which can act as facilitators by providing information regarding current policy-relevant research questions.

=====Bridging the gap through collaboration=====

There has been shift of policy-making from academic sources of development relations between government, academia and industry, and scholars often refer this as &quot;triple helix model&quot;. Henry Etzkowitz defines it as &quot;a spiral model of innovation that captures multiple reciprocal relationships at different points in the process of knowledge capitalization.&quot; Etzkowitz and Melo (2004) stated that recognizing that university is the source of new knowledge, industry is where the practice ground for technology and development and the supporting role of government as policy makers. The importance of collaboration is a successful model in any project management. More so when a holistic approach is applied in policy development, it may be a solution to address the complexity of policy implementation as all stakeholders are required to participate beginning from the conceptualization, planning, policy formulation and implementation.

==== Policy sciences ====
Nora Quebral (1971) defines development communication as &quot;the art and science of human communication applied to the speedy transformation of a country and the mass of its people from poverty to a dynamic state of economic growth that makes possible greater social equality and larger fulfilment of the human potential&quot;.

The fundamental characteristic that distinguishes development communication from traditional views of mass communication is its purposive nature. According to Flor, policies, being guidelines, imply that certain directions are already assumed. Development communication and the policies sciences stem from the same rationale, which is the need for actively applying knowledge form and principles of the social sciences in order to solve large-scale societal problems under the premise of social change.

Melafopulos (2008) presented two modes or approaches to development communication: the monologic mode and the dialogic mode. The monologic mode is linked to the standpoint of &#x27;diffusion&#x27; following the one-way model of communication. The purpose of this mode is to disseminate information and messages to persuade its recipients about the intended change. In short, communication is positioned to (1) inform and (2) persuade. In this model, the feedback is enhanced and canned allowing the sender to refine its persuasive message. On the other hand, dialogic mode is related with the participatory paradigm which follows a two-way communication model. It seeks to create a conducive environment where stakeholders are involved in all stages of the project from the definitions down to the implementation of solutions. This model seeks to make use of communication (1) to assess and (2) to empower. The use of dialogic communication paves the way for building of trust and understanding which is the key to participation and eventually for the empowerment of the people in the grassroots.

Achieving development in the community is collaboration between different stakeholders. Development communication believes that in order to have genuine development, that desire to improve and uplift their lives must come from the grassroots level; it must come from the people. Development communication empowers the people to believe in themselves that they can do something in order to alleviate their standard of living. In their book, Introduction to Development Communication, Ongkiko and Flor (2006) claimed that Development communication entails motivating individuals and groups of people such as farmers, fisherfolks, workers, housewives, and the youth to change their habits, their lifestyles, their way of thinking and their way of doing things. This further proves that development communication is not just merely providing facts and information instead its goal is to persuade the people to become an active participant in the achievement of their goals.

Policy sciences refer to the scientific study of policies and policy making. Policy refers to a cluster of decisions with a particular purpose and audience in mind. The word &quot;science&quot; is used to suggest the use of empirical data gathered from systematic observation. The plural form (sciences) is used to underscore the interdisciplinary nature of this field (Allen, 1978). Policy science was conceived in order to cope-up with the fast changing landscape of our society. Because of these changes they called, &quot;turbulent field&quot;, the traditional social science methodology was already considered inadequate in solving today&#x27;s societal problems (Allen, 1978). The goal of policy sciences is to develop and provide concrete solution to the rising problems brought by technological progress.

Policy sciences are concerned with knowledge of and in the decision processes of the public and civic order. Knowledge of the decision process implies systematic, empirical studies of how policies are made and put into effect. When knowledge is systematic, it goes beyond the aphoristic remarks that are strewn through the &quot;wisdom&quot; literature of the past.

Development communication and policy sciences are two essential elements in resolving recurring dilemma especially in the third world societies.

==== In the Information Age ====
In Flor&#x27;s &quot;Developing Societies in the Information Age: A Critical Perspective&quot;, he mentioned the 2000 Okinawa Summit of G7/G8 nations that described information and communications technology or ICT as &quot;one of the most potent forces in shaping the Twenty-first Century...fast becoming a vital engine of growth for the world economy&quot;. The summit also decried the existence of a digital divide between rich and poor nations and that the major challenge posed today is to bridge this widening chasm. The Information Age, the so-called third era of human civilization is a pervasive social phenomenon, a global environment. In the Information Age, capital becomes less important than information. In fact, information becomes the &quot;primary resource&quot;. There is an observed global shift in resources of power from land, labor and capital to information. The change is more on the nature of resources that are being controlled.

As Flor stated, &quot;informatization comes with the Information Age. All aspects of society – politics, culture, business and economy – have become increasingly information-oriented. Information gives rise to economies and societies wherein information, naturally, becomes the dominant commodity or resource. Concomitant to informatization is the globalization of the economy. The communications or information revolution has tended to shrink the size of the world, figuratively. Instant communication between two persons situated at opposite sides of the globe is a common occurrence. Distance no longer serves as a minor factor in communication.&quot;

===== Information society vs. Information Age =====
An &quot;information society&quot; should be differentiated from &quot;Information Age&quot;. An information society refers to a social system, meanwhile, the Information Age refers to an era in human civilization, a worldwide phenomenon. It is possible for people to live in an information age but not in an information society. Observations have also pointed that the trend towards information societies can be found in the Third World. For example, in Asia, certain trends that are indifferent to political developments show that Asia is moving towards that direction. These trends include: the growing demand for mobile devices and software, broadband, Wi-Fi, wi-max services, and even online educational programs.

===== Control through communication =====
&quot;Control is achieved through communication. Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics, equated communication with control and observed that it is negatively related to entropy, the tendency for all systems towards breakdown. This function or relationship is magnified in the Information Age.&quot; Therefore, in the Information Age, there seems to be a positive correlation between information and power, between communication and power. The logical consequence of this is the gravitation of special interest groups to the communication/information industry and the mad scramble for communication resources. Those who will gain access to more resources would understandably hold more political and economic power. They may, in turn, perpetuate this condition by determining enabling societal structures. According to Flor, information, traditionally defined, is that which contributes to the reduction of uncertainty. Although technically accurate, the definition neglects the social dimension of information. &quot;It is the social function which adds value to information and which gives those who possess it advantage over those who do not. Thus, information should be regarded first and foremost as a resource. As in the case of other resources, there is a tendency for other exploitative groups to hoard information and to use it to further their interests. Information nowadays is associated with influence and power. It is now treated as a dominant commodity under the control and manipulation of the elite.&quot; He also noted that &quot;Information resources should contribute more towards equality than exploitation, towards harmony than conflict, towards complementarities than dominance, towards integration than segregation, towards participation than elitism, towards indigenous development than dependency, and towards convergence than divergence.&quot;

The availability of information may be a function of the availability of mass media, new media and other channels of information. Availability of communication media is obviously a prerequisite for access. For communities wherein media are relatively unavailable, access to communication media is hampered to a considerable degree.

In contrast, development communication can also be key towards more democratic societies. Democracy has been a prevailing philosophy in many countries for the recent years. However, until today, how democratic institutions affect human well-being, particularly people&#x27;s health is still argued. Existing evidences are not robust or strong in providing critical insights into the significance of democratic institutions on achieving better life expectancies and reducing mortalities (Besley and Kudamatsu, 2006). Life expectancies have increased dramatically and mortalities have significant reduced over the years. Such progress has been mostly attributed to increasing income per capita (Li and Zhu, 2006), improved medical technologies and interventions (Papageorgiou et al., 2007) and strengthened global collaborations (Elobu et al., 2014, Chu et al., 2014), among others. Previous literature has also favoured more democratic governments in maximizing health systems performance; and thereafter, improving health outcomes. In this view, health outcomes are better achieved because governments are controlled by the majority, leaders are more accountable for the benefit of all rather than minor groups of society, and mechanisms for selecting competent leaders to implement policies are deemed stronger. Despite evidence on its significance, some have still argued that democracy can only be successful in effecting positive impacts only if proper conditions are met. For example, the 1983 Polish health system has moved from a communist model without general practitioners to where clinicians in polyclinics provided free healthcare. The former system was then perceived to be better because the latter created more opportunities for bribery; hence, increasing inequitable access to healthcare (Scully, 2007). Recently, most health systems have transitioned along a continuum of private or market health systems similar to the United States and a public or state health systems similar to the United Kingdom (Chernichovsky, 1995). Such transitions may also be highly attributable to transitions in political states. In a market/private-based health system similar to the United States health system, medical care is provided by private physicians and by private and public hospitals and patients have free choice of physicians. In addition, most people receive health insurance coverage through their workplace and health insurance is provided by multiple third-party insurers (Chernichovsky, 1995). On the other hand, planned/public-based health systems such as in the United Kingdom expects that healthcare is a right (Chernichovsky, 1995). As such, health demands are provided directly through budgeting and management of providers. Low and middle income countries (LMICs) are placed in between these continuum. In most LMICs, various health system reforms and transitions have already been done. Despite such transitions, they are still faced with poorer health outcomes and health statuses that are far beyond health targets. Hence, is it really democracy that matters or does it simply serve as proxy for societal and political progress? Some argued that proper conditions must first be met for such gains of democracy to be achieved. Development communication can serve as a tool to ensure the country&#x27;s visions are aligned, a step towards creating such proper conditions.

===== Information and communication technologies for development =====
In the Information Age, technological growth is a crucial driving force behind economic progress, citizen engagement and job creation. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are shaping many aspects of the world&#x27;s economies, governments and societies. Developing countries, too, recognize the importance of engaging various stakeholders to harness the transformative power of ICTs to provide more efficient services, catalyze economic development and strengthen social networks. When done properly and implemented effectively, ICT infrastructure investment and policy reform can empower poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

The World Bank Group&#x27;s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector strategy, which was adopted in 2012, intends to help developing countries make use of the potential of ICTs to improve the delivery of public services; drive innovations and productivity gains; and improve competitiveness. Under the strategy, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) focus on three priorities: (1) &quot;Transformation&quot;, by making developments more open and accountable and improving service delivery; (2) &quot;Connectivity&quot;, by scaling up affordable access to broadband including for women, disabled citizens, disadvantaged communities and people living in remote and rural areas; and (3) &quot;Innovation&quot;, by developing competitive IT-based industries and fostering ICT innovation with a focus on job creation.

Nascent technologies, such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence, are also set to reshape the development landscape. The United Nations, through its Virtual Reality Series Project, has tapped virtual reality to build platforms for advocacy, awareness, and fundraising. Its VR production titled Clouds over Sidra earned accolades for shedding light on the conditions of some 84,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan&#x27;s Za&#x27;atari camp. HTC, developer of the Vive VR system, also supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals through its &quot;VR for Impact&quot; program, which seeks to &quot;create a pathway to global peace and prosperity together&quot;. In terms of policy implication, the immersive experience brought about by VR is expected &quot;to elevate the voices of those who often do not have a say, bringing peoples&#x27; voices directly into the decision making process&quot;.

==== Digital divide ====
The rapid transformation of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate. As a result, more and more people are getting &quot;wired&quot;, which means connected to the Internet. The explosion of information creates an interconnected global village where everyone can easily connect and transact business in a flick of a second. This explosion of information however has widen the gap between the information rich and the information poor creating Digital Divide. Groups or communities that can afford technologies and has full access to the internet are the information rich while the underprivileged are the information poor.

In his book &quot;Developing Societies in the Information Age&quot;, Alexander Flor elucidated that digital divide emerges from an information dependent social environment. He further emphasized that &quot;the divide is further aggravated by domineering system between the haves and the have-nots&quot;. In a study conducted by Dr. Alexander Flor from 1983 to 1986 on the widening gap and its implications on the agricultural sector, he found out that &quot;the information rich gets richer while the information poor gets poorer.&quot;

====Gender equality====

Although the discourse of development communication may recognize the importance of considering gender in the process of social change, organizational structures and norms may inhibit the successful implementation of projects. Despite the considerable attention directed toward women in health, nutrition, and population projects, women&#x27;s conditions have not improved. This failure should not, however, be attributed as a direct consequence of development communication. Rather, the problematic conditions of women, along with the interventions designed to resolve them, need to be situated within a broader context of discourse and practice that privileges individual consumption and structural privatization in strategies for social change (Watkins, 1999, 63).

Hooda and Singh (2012) note that many feminist scholars recognize that everyday women&#x27;s participation in the process of communication is essential. Involvement by the women to state their opinions in the institutions and systems that govern their lives is not only for recognition that participation is a basic human right, but also for a redistribution of political power in favor of disadvantaged groups. Involvement in decision-making is primarily about confronting the hegemonic structures of power—locally, nationally and globally (Sheth, 1997). It is a political action, a political struggle, a struggle that is not only among states, but also among people. Indeed, Wong (2012) shows why a discourse on gender matters in ICT for Development. Wong (2012) cites Resurreccion (2011) who stresses that the access to, and the use of, ICTs is gender-shaped in that gender influences how the benefits, costs and risks of ICTs are distributed between, and within, women and men. As noted by Kothari (1985), communications is not taken as informatics (alone), but as politics on issues of empowerment.

Information and communication, food security and nutrition, and gender equality are closely linked dimensions of rural development, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-Dimity Project, 2011. The vital contribution of women to the agricultural sphere in developing societies cannot be overemphasized. It&#x27;s critical to give rural women access to the same resources and opportunities as men in order to be more productive. To achieve enhanced productivity and better performance, women have to be provided access to information, knowledge and decision-making. Hooda and Singh (2011) however opine that with regard to the impact of technologies on women, there has been a tendency on the part of governments and development agencies to treat technologies as neutral, value-free, without taking into account the social, environmental and economic effects of the technology being introduced. A common assumption with respect to technology is that the simple existence of technology itself will advance competence and will thus fetch empowerment and reimbursement to the women. Wong (2012) illustrates that restricted access to assets, gender-biased institutional arrangements, and unfavourable social structures have reduced women&#x27;s capability to draw on ICTs in tackling climate change. According to Hooda and Singh (2011), focus on ICT competence and capability compromises concerns related to equity. In any case, social equity requires assurance to women&#x27;s equal opportunity. Therefore, women&#x27;s equality needs to be integrated as a cornerstone of any development and communication strategy. In addressing these limitations, Wong (2012) outlines four digital empowerment proposals that may make &#x27;ICT climate change&#x27; interventions more gender-sensitive:

(1) Contextualise gender mainstreaming: gender mainstreaming helps integrate gender analysis into ICT policies. It acknowledges that men and women perceive and receive information differently, and that this requires diverse approaches to adaptation. However, the attempt to reposition women and girls as &#x27;ecocarers&#x27; is problematic because this fails to capture their protective, as well as their destructive, role in relation to natural resources. Without addressing the unequal power relations between women

and girls, e-adaptive practices can also help reproduce the intergenerational equalities.

(2) Strengthen governance: crafting new and reforming old, institutional arrangements is essential to improve gender inclusion. Women only interventions are sometimes necessary to empower previously excluded women to engage in ICT related decisions. However, poor and powerless men should also have their say in climate change policies.

(3) Develop gender-sensitive funding mechanisms: securing adequate funding to support ICT interventions is crucial to gender empowerment. Yet, targeting women by microcredit projects risk putting an additional financial burden on them, and that needs serious reconsideration.

(4) Recognise agency-structure dynamics: women are active agents, but they are socially constrained from engaging in ICT related decisions. Women&#x27;s preferences, institutional arrangements and politics need to be taken into account in order to tackle digital exclusion.

Wong (2012) believes that taking the outlined four proposals are useful for development agencies, governments and NGOs to improve the gendered outcomes from use of ICTs in response to an issue as climate change. Thus, communicating from a gender perspective is important for fighting poverty and for supporting the economic empowerment of women. Women who are frequently the most disadvantaged gender in society are central to development, yet they have very little voice in the process of development planning. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Gender Equality and Women&#x27;s Empowerment reports that &quot;while women make up more than 40 percent of the agriculture labor force, only 3 to 20 percent are landholders. In Africa, women-owned enterprises make up as little as 10 percent of all businesses. In South Asia, that number is only 3 percent. And despite representing half the global population, women comprise less than 20 percent of the world&#x27;s legislators.&quot;

Advancing gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment is a vital key in utilizing human resources and capital on an enormous scale. According to the World Bank, &quot;&quot;countries with greater gender equality are more prosperous and competitive&quot;.&quot; For communities to grow, gender equality policy and strategies have to be developed and implemented. Women must be provided access to information, technology, and education. They must have equal rights and equal opportunities as entrepreneurs, wage earners, and leaders of our society. Promoting gender equality is a profitable investment we can make to advance women development.

Since its early inception, development communication has been widely utilized by many regions of the world owing its strategic direction of alleviating the lives of the poor by extending knowledge and information to a number of projects and programs intended to create a sustainable life. Hence, development communication practice in various areas of the world yielded a number of policy integrations reflecting its core objectives for an inclusive development. True to its definition, development communication, according to S.T. Kwame Boafo, author of the article &#x27;Utilizing Development Communication Strategies in African Societies: A Critical Perspective&#x27;, &quot;is the application of modem and traditional communication technologies to aid and enhance the process of socio-economic, political and cultural change. It is the planned, conscious and systematized use of communication strategies and processes to bridge informational and attitudinal gaps and to establish or sustain a climate that favors the process of change and development.&quot; However, this definition itself does not lend the idea that change immediately follows. Hence, Boafo articulated further that the definition above &quot;does not imply that communication or information per se can effect development or change without an integrated and consistently pursued national development policy.&quot; Therefore, it is vital that development communication should be an integral element in the formulation of national policies so as to utilize its full potential.

==== Catholic Church: sample communications policies ====
Christ commissioned the Apostles to preach the Good News to the whole world, a mission extended to all Christians today. Communication therefore is part of following Christ. Being committed to spread the Good News, the Catholic Church has always been at the forefront of communications – from oral preaching, catechesis, personal friendships, small or big groups gatherings (openly or in secret where Christians are persecuted, even in present times), manual copying in papyrus or parchments scrolls, artwork, architecture, oral traditions, printing, theaters, tri-media and online, etc.

For academic studies within the Catholic setting, Pontifical Universities in Rome offer Bachelor&#x27;s, Licentiate and Doctoral courses on Church communications, lasting three to six years.

The following guidelines, and communication as a whole, should, as Prof. Flor states, &quot;be employed for the service of others&quot; (Chapter 3, p. 7).

Catholic Church Communications at the universal Church level: The Pope&#x27;s Roman Curia

The Roman Curia, or the Pope&#x27;s central administrative office, has a Secretariat for Communication, which coordinates all the media realities in the Vatican:
Pontifical Council for Social Communications
Holy See Press Office
Vatican Internet Service
Vatican Radio
Vatican Television Centre
L&#x27;Osservatore Romano
Vatican Printing Press
Photo Service
Vatican Publishing House

This setup is replicated in various degrees in countries all over the world. Communications policies are left to the regional, national or parish levels, rather than having a unified policy for the Catholic Church in the whole world.

Many documents, in the form of reflections or guidelines, have been published on different topics related with communications. In this website, one document dates back to 1936, an Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XI, called &quot;Vigilanti Cura&quot;, manifesting his thoughts on the &quot;Motion Picture&quot; as it affects the moral and religious life of Christians.

Example of Catholic Church Communications Policies at the Regional Level: CELAM

The Consejo Episcopal LatinoAmericano (CELAM), is the umbrella organization of 22 Episcopal Conferences (groups of Latin American and Caribbean Catholic Bishops, usually by country). Its office is based in Bogotá, Colombia, and has a Department of Communications and Press.

While no Communications Policy is posted on CELAM&#x27;s website (nor is any retrievable online), there is a link to a presentation of the Department&#x27;s four programs. Specific objectives contained therein could be considered as general directives indicating what the different lower levels of Church organization should undertake (my own translation from Spanish follows):
Common Communication Efforts in Communion and Dialogue towards Fraternity
Formation and Expression in Communication for the Development of the Culture of Encounter and the Announcing the Good News
Communication for the Transformation of Reality Towards the Fullness of Life of our Peoples
Inter-institutional Communion and Dialogue (within the Church)

CELAM is situated at a very broad level, covering part of North America (Mexico), the whole of Central and South America, and the Caribbeans. It is quite typical for Church documents at a high level, to focus heavily on principles, objectives and generalized directives; meanwhile, the concrete communications policies would be left to the local levels.

Example of Catholic Church Communications Policies at the National Level: USCCB Social Media Guidelines

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) &quot;is an assembly of the hierarchy of the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands who jointly exercise certain pastoral functions on behalf of the Christian faithful of the United States. As its Introduction states, &quot;These guidelines are offered as a synthesis of best practices. They include material compiled from church entities, for-profit corporations, and non-profit organizations&quot;, presented as an aide to come up with local or organizational communications policies when it comes to the social media.
It begins with guiding principles, quoting from Pope Francis: &quot;Communication is a means of expressing the missionary vocation of the entire Church; today the social networks are one way to experience this call to discover the beauty of faith, the beauty of encountering Christ. In the area of communications too, we need a Church capable of bringing warmth and of stirring hearts&quot;.

Social media is a powerful instrument, changing the way people communicate. Pope Benedict XVI says that the Church has to be involved in social media to advance its mission of spreading the Good News, at the same time encouraging respect and dialogue, true friendship. In addition, the Church encourages a responsible use of these social media, in the midst of opportunities and challenges when it comes to visibility, the community and accountability.

The USCCB document tries to cover all the areas in social media, suggesting the following elements to be included when parishes or other Church organizations develop guidelines: define boundaries, include examples of codes of conduct, define instructions, recommendations on dealing with offenders, providing trusted sites, and reminding administrators of their broad audience. Guidelines are also provided for organizational and personal sites, and social networking with minors.

Example of Catholic Church Communications Policies at the Local Level: St. Mary Magdalene Catholic Church, in Simpsonville, South Carolina, USA

These policies pertain to the parish&#x27;s:

Internal Communication, such as:
Mass Announcements
Welcome/Newcomer Information
Mailings to parishioners
Email communications
Parish bulletin
Parish events for parishioners
Distributed materials

and External Communication, such as:
Marquee on the parish sign
Media interviews
Parish events open to public
Parish website
Press releases
Social media
Community Solicitations

Being a parish that serves the churchgoers, St. Mary Magdalene Catholic Church tries to make clear the procedures that would make the communications processes as efficient as possible. The document is quite detailed, allowing the reader (whether a parish employee, or the public) to know exactly how to proceed in each scenario.

== International communication ==

International communication, the intellectual field that deals with issues of mass communication at a global level, is sometimes also called development communication. This field includes the history of the telegraph, submarine communication cables, shortwave or international broadcasting, satellite television, and global flows of mass media. Today it includes issues of the Internet in a global perspective and the use of new technologies such as mobile phones.

== Risk communication ==
Risk communication originated in the United States where environmental clean-up efforts were implemented through legislation. The terms &#x27;risk communications&#x27; and &#x27;risk management&#x27; were first used by William Ruckelshaus, the first administrator of the U.S. &#x27;Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was established in the 1970s. Risk communication includes management decision risks, implementation risks and risks related to existing environmental, health, political, or social circumstances. For instance, in the health sector, risk communication addresses pandemics, natural disasters, bioterrorism, resource contamination, etc. Definitions of &quot;risk&quot; include:
&quot;The identification and analysis, either qualitative or quantitative, of the likelihood of the occurrence of a hazardous event overexposure, and the severity of injury or illness that may be caused by it.&quot; —American National Standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (ANSI/AIHA Z10 – 2005 ):
&quot;...the probability that a substance or situation will produce harm under specified conditions. Risk is a combination of two factors: (1) the probability that an adverse event will occur and (2) the consequences of the adverse event.&quot;—The Framework for Environmental Health Risk Management (Presidential/Congressional Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management, 1997):
&quot;...the probability (or likelihood) that a harmful consequence will occur as a result of an action.&quot;—The Safety Professionals Handbook (Fields 2008 ):

Risk management was described as:
The evaluations and decisions that go into coping with risks (Lundgren and McMakin, 2004)
Planning for a crisis, which should involve the removal of risks and allow an organization, a society, or a system adequate control(Fearn-Banks, 2007) and
Factors that combat crises with the objective of minimizing damage. (Combs, 1999)

Risk communications involves important information for managing risks, both from authorities to those at risk and vice versa.

Development communication benefits from risk communications when the latter clarifies the risks of development (or lack thereof).

==Policy analysis in an organizational communication==

Development in the community has been observed critically not only the stakeholders but also the public themselves. Being one the recipients of the community projects, the public has been eyeing the government on the implementation of the development projects they are implementing. Part of the analysis in the organization is by analyzing how the communication in an organization works. The two are related as discussed as follows:

===Communication and its roles in development===
In the Philippines, the Medium Term Development Plan for 2004–2010 of the National Economic Development Authority states, &quot;the successful implementation of the plan rests on the support of all sectors of society—the legislature, the judiciary, the local government units, the media and all sectors of society&quot; (NEDA, 2004).

In the context of Carnoy and Samoff (1990), they believed that education has great importance as part of the means of achieving social transformation. They emphasized that &quot;appropriate ideas, values, and worldviews will be developed so that from the process of scholarship there emerges a new person—not simply with skills, but also someone with an understanding of his or her own role in the world&quot;.

More than analyzing how the process of the implementation will run through, it is also relative to note who will deliver the message pertaining to the development project. This is where the role of communication takes place. As mentioned by NEDA, media played an important role in the process of the delivery of development projects. With the wide range of power of media to influence and to transmit information, it has the capability to reach the public connecting to the government and vice versa.

Communication is pervasive in the process of development. Communication includes mass media, telecommunications, information and communication technologies (ICTs), organized interpersonal communication, and all resources used by a society to enable information to flow within it. It has for its aims to inform, educate, persuade, entertain, motivate people and induce behavior change that contributes toward national development.

According to Fraser and Restrepo-Estrada (2001):
&quot;Communication succeeds when it is an integral part, from the very beginning, of a development programme, playing a full role during the identification of the problems and priorities, as well as during the detailed planning, implementation, and evaluation... communication needs clear objectives, identification of different audience groups... careful message design... and monitoring and feedback.&quot;

===Communication and organizational theory===
As mentioned, delivery of development project can be achieved should proper communication will be used. In attaining such, an organization implementing the development project should consider the system to be used.
An organization is where a system is being implemented. Its structure varied depending on the goals of the company, the image it portrays, and the quality it aims to achieve. Being a member of an organization, one has to know how the organization works.

This aim in knowing the technical-know-how within the organization leads to the concept of &#x27;Organization Theory&#x27;. Later it becomes a &#x27;social science discipline&#x27; which refers to &quot;a body of thinking and writing that describes, explains and influences what goes on in organization&quot;. This leads to making this discipline as basis for exploring &#x27;management and leadership theory&#x27; that enables the scholars to understand how an &#x27;organization theory&#x27; works in the application of a certain system.

Further, organizational theory (OT), according to Barzilai (2016), is the &quot;study of organizations for the benefit of identifying common themes for the purpose of solving problems, maximizing efficiency and productivity, and meeting the needs of stakeholders&quot;.

Thus, development communication interweaves with policy science and organizational theory for one reason: Development projects require an organization as deciding body in crafting policy leading to the attainment of the project and as implementor of the projects.

==Interface revisited and reinforced: development communication and policy sciences==

To affirm the interface, I reviewed the notions of development communication and policy sciences. Development education, a related and a younger discipline is shortly discussed. I also highlight the similarities of these fields.

Quebral (2012) redefines development communication as &quot;the science of human communication linked to the transition of communities from poverty in all its forms to a dynamic overall growth that fosters equity and the unfolding of individual potential&quot; (p. 9).

Meanwhile, Guru (2016) explains that development communication &quot;(1) provides a conceptual and practical framework in accelerating development in all spheres of life; (2) includes the integration of planned, organized, and specific communication package into planning, programming, and implementation; (3)facilitates the flow of development education among various stakeholders; and (4) empowers marginalized individuals, groups, and organizations&quot; (p. 101).

I thought that development education is just a function or a subset of development communication just like information, motivation, persuasion, among others. In fact, it is discipline in its own right that started in the 1990s. Bourn (2015) describes it as &quot;an education approach that (1) responds to issues of development, human rights, justice, and world citizenship; (2) presents an international development and human rights perspective within education in various parts of the world; (3) promotes voices and viewpoints of those who are excluded from an equal share in the benefits of international human development; (4) connects and compares development issues and challenges all over the world; (5) provides opportunities for people to reflect on their international roles and responsibilities with regard to issues of equality and justice in human development; and (6) narrates a new story of human development&quot; (p. 47).

On the other hand, policy sciences or policy studies basically refer to the policy cycle, which involves &quot;policy making, policy implementation, policy evaluation, and policy feedback&quot; (Flynn and Asquer, 2017, p. 40). Originally, it is a function of governance and, therefore the domain of government officials. However, with democracy as a form of government in many nations, it has also become the domain of the governed, hence, the term public policy. Most available literature on policy studies quote the definition developed by Hence Thomas Dye as &quot;whatever governments choose to do or not to do.&quot;

However, Chakrabarty and Chand (2016) argue that &quot;[t]here cannot be a universal definition of policy although one can endure a near universal definition by highlighting its technical character&quot; (p. 3). With these, they characterize Dye&#x27;s definition as &quot;functional in character&quot; and contend that &quot;governments are not at all free to choose because their choice is context-dependent and governed by the ideology they adhere to&quot; (p. 4).

They raise the limitations Dye&#x27;s definition: (1) does not reflect or represent the ideological goals of the government; (2) does not reflect the critical role of institutions; and (3) does not provide enough inputs to conceptualize public policy as an executive device and as a marker of ideology.

After presenting the etymology of &quot;public&quot; and &quot;policy&quot;, they propose a layman&#x27;s definition through an acronym: POLICY. PO stands for periodically organized, which suggests that policies are &quot;constantly reinvented and transformed in accordance with changing social, economic, and political realities&quot;. To add, LI means legally induced, which suggests it cannot dispense &quot;constitutions and other legal instruments in shaping policy.&quot; Lastly, CY means calculated yields, which implies that policies must be beneficial and profitable (p. 6).

With this, they propose a definition, that is, &quot;[p]olicy being a functional design seeking to fulfill certain objectives on the basis of specific calculations of the pros and the cons, and this is naturally context-dependent&quot; (p. 7). Hence, it has a dynamic character: (1) it considers the changing environment, and (2) it prioritizes public good.

They also enumerate the features of a policy: (1) intentional or deliberately designed to address societal issues; (2) a course of action with specific goals and objectives; (3) devised in response to a perceived need or demand or problem; (4)creates an environment in which various actors converge to develop policy designs; (5) an authoritative decision by the government (Chakbarty and Chand, 2016, p. 8).

Three broad and dynamic disciplines are presented. It is then instructive to highlight their commonalities or similarities to affirm their interface: (1) systematic (planned, organized, designed, or an approach); (2) change-oriented, preferably for the better if not the best (public good); (3) holistic and multidimensional; (4) pro-people or advocates of equity or social justice, and (5) largely participatory.

Development education, being the youngest field or discipline, has two distinct emphases: sustainable development and global citizenship (Bourn, 2015). A number of modifiers have come before the term development over time, but the most recent is sustainable, hence, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Guru (2016) defines it as &quot;a vision of the future that provides necessary blueprint through which the developmental activities of individuals and institutions can be streamlined on the basis of ethical, humanitarian, and professional considerations&quot; (p. 85). It has three dimensions: social, economic, and environmental (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002 in Guru, 2016). In fact, it is imperative for both development practitioners and policy makers to understand these dimensions.

== Culture ==
In the context of globalization, the need for communication is increasing. Many countries has invested in developing their technology which in turns speed up the exchange of information across different countries. This has led to a more complex work context in different institutions especially in business, education, and non-profit organizations. Employees not only has to deal with a lot of things that are not present in a very homogenous environment like observing other religious holidays, communicating in different languages, and also understanding different preferences on certain things. In a multi-cultural environment, organizational culture becomes more complex.

There were countless of research that show how poor communication can lead to poor organizational performance. It is important for every organisation to develop an effective means to communicate internally and externally in the organization and find ways to develop a health knowledge sharing culture. Understanding the impact of globalisation is crucial for any organisation to be competitive in the global market. In this context, effective communication is expected to create a healthy organizational culture by providing necessary information that will bridge many gaps in the organization.

Flor (2007) noted that &quot;communication and culture are inextricably linked&quot; (p. 112). Seemingly, communication constitutes culture and vice versa in any organizational engagement internally and externally. From time immemorial, effective internal organizational communication which reduces uncertainties and increases productivity in the workplace has been the common goal of many organizations worldwide. Consequently, effective communication processes could mean effective communication policies are in place explicitly or have been legitimized in practice. Making this complicated is perceived in how decision-makers, policy experts and organizational members interact in furthering organizational communication processes. Flor (2007) describes potential complexities at work that could burden more than could help the organization&#x27;s communication culture.The really difficult part of communication work (and perhaps the most time consuming) is pleasing everybody from your superior, to the subject matter specialist and, finally, to the user whose opinions (and tastes) may altogether vary from those of the decision-maker. This potentially is the most time consuming particularly since, right or wrong, everyone believes that he is a communication expert (p.167-168).

=== Participatory approach, community radio and policy development ===

The roots of participatory approaches in development communication according to Yoon (1996) can be found in the early years of the 1970s when many people in the development community began to question the top-down approach of development dominant in the 1950s and 60s which targeted the economic growth of countries as its main goal. Development according to Yoon (1996) was &quot;thought to be triggered by the wide-scale diffusion and adoption of modern technologies&quot;. Such modernization Yoon (1996) further expounds, was planned in the national capitals under the guidance and direction of experts brought-in from developed countries. Often, the people in the villages who are the &quot;objects&quot; of these plans were the last to know when &quot;strangers from the city turned-up, frequently unannounced, to survey land or look at project sites&quot;. However, the demarcation of the First, Second and Third Worlds by the late 1960s to early 1980s has broken down and the cross-over centre-periphery can be found in every region, a need for a new concept of development which emphasizes cultural identity and multidimensionality is raised (Servaes and Malikhao, 2005). Servaes and Malikhao (2005) posit that the&#x27;global&#x27; world, in general as well as in its distinct regional and national entities, is confronted with multifaceted crises. Apart from the obvious economic and financial crisis, they elaborate that one could also refer to social, ideological, moral, political, ethnic, ecological and security crises thus the previously held dependency perspective has become more difficult to support because of the growing interdependency of regions, nations and communities in the globalized world. A new viewpoint on development and social change has come to the forefront according to them which &quot;the common starting point is the examination of the changes from &#x27;bottom-up&#x27;, from the self-development of the local community&quot;.

At first, speech, traditional and folk media, and group activities were considered the most appropriate instruments for supporting participatory communication hence, the practitioners in the mass media responded by innovating their own approach towards participatory communication (Yoon, 1996) which brought the emergence of community radios. The historical philosophy of community radio is to use this medium as the voice of the voiceless, the mouthpiece of the oppressed people and generally as a tool for development. Yoon (1996) articulates that in community radios, the people &quot;produced and voiced the programs which were focused on local issues which were the most current and important making way for participatory communication to be practiced at both the community or village level and at the broader regional or sub-regional level&quot;. Most of the successes of community broadcasting are to be found in the non-formal education sector (Beltran, 1993 in Yoon, 1996). Literacy programs have been effectively conducted via community radio and television stations. Other subjects covered by these stations include gender issues, farming, health, income-generation, workers&#x27; safety and occupational health, land tenure, and religious matters (Yoon, 1996).

Mhagama (2015) posits that participatory development projects such as community radio employ a participatory approach to decision making processes and enable marginalized people to &quot;define their own development path through the identification and implementation of projects that are initiated by them&quot;. He stresses that &quot;participatory communication gives the local community a right to freely share or exchange information and to reach a consensus on what they want to do or to be done and how to do it&quot;. Tamminga (1997) in Mhagama (2015) addresses that in community radio the dichotomy between the rich and the marginalized sectors like women, indigenous peoples and the poor is broken by &quot;allowing listeners an opportunity to shape the medium to meet their own specific needs and breakdown the monopolies of knowledge and power that marginalize them politically, economically and socially&quot;. In one project of UNESCO in partnership with the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), and the Philippine government a participatory communication project using community radio dubbed as &quot;Tambuli&quot; (Tambuli is a Filipino term referring to a traditional way of calling villagers to an important meeting)(Jayaweera and Tabing, 1997) was launched in 1991. According to Howley (2005) the project was able to make the community residents come to appreciate radio&#x27;s potential as a forum to discuss issues of mutual concern allowing the local populations to give immediate and sustained feedback to local, regional and even national political leaders and authorities which afforded them greater opportunity to chart their own destiny.

Howley (2010) as cited in Mhagama (2015) stressed that &quot;community radio highlights people&#x27;s ability to alter and rearrange existing media structures to better suit their needs&quot;. This is made possible Servaes (1996) in Mhagama (2015) concludes because community radio allows non-professionals to participate in media production, management, and planning of the communication systems.

== Development communication and the policy sciences work together towards social change ==
Flor (n. d., as cited in Academia, 2015) states that policy sciences and development communication have seemingly identical underlying function in society: to solve societal issues and make social change possible for the benefit of the greater majority. Development communication and policy sciences share key characteristics. First, both policy sciences and development communication are purposive. They serve specific and systematic functions to achieve a common goal which is to solve issues and problems in society in order to achieve change. Second, both policy sciences and development communication believe that, at times, power and corrupt practices in the government have the potential to undermine reasoned logic. This is evident in the commercialisation of mass media that advances profit over social responsibility. Thus, development communication and policy sciences have the role to combat such corrupt practices. The third characteristic that policy sciences and development communication share is to heed action for policies to take effect. Policies that remain in print/word without action is a futile enterprise. A policy to be effective needs to be implemented, monitored, assessed and sustained. For development communication and policy sciences to make great impact to the world, participation or engagement of stakeholders is necessary. Below is an analysis of a few studies that deal with how development communication relates with policy sciences, and how they fuse in order to effect change in the larger society. In a discussion on the policy sciences, Allen (1978, as cited in Flor, n. d.) states:Since communication permeates every facet of a person&#x27;s behaviour, the study of communication is no less than one way to study policy making. Communication is a useful concept precisely because it is one more handle whereby we can effectively study policy making. Communication is one of those few variables through which any policy decision is dependent (p.69).

Another example where development communication takes an important role is in the global health space. International organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, ASEAN, and the United Nations have all used the principles of development communication to achieve global impacts. Specifically, on 8 August 1967, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which was then composed of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand was established with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration). In the succeeding years, other Southeast Asian countries have joined, including Brunei (1984), Viet Nam (1995), Lao PDR (1997), Myanmar (1997), and Cambodia (1999) (ASEAN 2012a: 1). It was established to accelerate the economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region; promote regional peace and stability; promote active collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest; provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities; and collaborate more effectively for the greater utilization of their agriculture and industries; among others (ASEAN 2012a: 1). Criticisms on the ASEAN have, however, noted various failures in the regionalism efforts in Southeast Asia. Previous studies have defined regionalism as &quot;more than an institutional process of multilateral policy coordination and the negotiation of competing stakeholder interests... [It is a] collective and intersubjective identities&quot; (Elliott 2003: 29–52). Recent regionalism efforts worldwide also worked either institutionally or through cooperation among governments (Anonymous2005: 2291–2313). Although some argues that the ASEAN&#x27;s regionalism efforts were seen as more of cooperation among the governments rather than an institutional one, development communication can play a key role in bridging these countries and towards commitment to the Declaration.

== Risk and disaster communication amongst the youths ==
The youths hold a pivotal role in making a difference in society. Being digital natives, they communicate efficiently, develop networks pervasively, and create, influence and change social norms and practices. In short, being communication natives who can create a collective voice, they have the power to influence policies and change perspectives deeply rooted in society. For instance, during disasters, the youths are viewed as passive victims with no role in communicating risks or preventing and responding to disasters. Since disaster management seems to be predominated by top-down strategies, not bottom-up, the youths are seen as weaklings who are at the receiving end of calamity relief operations. However, Mitchell, Haynes, Hall, Wei and Oven (2008) seem to have refuted this perception based on the findings of their case studies in El Salvador and New Orleans. Mitchell et al. (2008) concluded that children and youths can be potential informants within informal and formal risk communication networks. Their case studies have shown that:children and youth can become effective conduits, vehicles and bridges as they are embedded within the household and community and can act as trusted two-way &quot;translators&quot; and communicators. Overall, children and youth were found to be effective communicators of risk when language barriers exist increasing the agency of young people, an outside agent has helped support the organization of youth groups, the community has strong social cohesion, and there is a level of distrust in political sources (such as police impunity) (p. 269).In the Philippines, a study by Fernandez and Shaw (2013) found that even until today, &quot;young people are not given an active role in (or worse, are excluded from) the action toward disaster risk reduction&quot; (p. 135). Fernandez and Shaw&#x27;s (2013) review of national policies of the Philippines related to youth council participation in disaster risk reduction (DRR) shows discrepancies between ideal scenarios and actual youth participation in DRR in practice. So much more needs to be done in engaging young people in helping build disaster resilient communities. However, although these discrepancies exist, there are many success stories of Filipino youths involved in development programs with the aim to prepare communities for disasters. The National Youth Commission (NYC, 2013) believed that children and youth are not just a vulnerable group, but can play vital roles in their communities to prepare for future disasters. For instance, the Tanay Mountaineers Youth Arm, a Ten Accomplished Youth Organization (TAYO) 2013 winner, has been responding to victims of disasters not only in Tanay, Rizal but even in Quezon Province since Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) hit their town in 2009 (Rappler.com, 2014). The local government of Tanay has tapped the Tanay Mountaineers as the official disaster response team of the municipality. Another TAYO 2013 winner, the Hayag Youth Organization, carried out the &quot;Langoy para sa Kaluwasan,&quot; a Swim Camp Disaster Preparedness and Open Water Safety Training for children and youth from impoverished communities in Ormoc City, Leyte. This is in response to the fact that many youths in Ormoc still do not know how to swim apart from the fact that water safety skills are not taught to them in school (Rappler.com, 2014). Despite scepticism, there still exists a growing optimism that policy scientists and communication policy developers can help review and reaffirm existing youth policies in the Philippines in engaging youth groups themselves for DRR projects, among others. Fernandez and Shaw (2013) posited that open and engaging communication is necessary so that the youths become more involved in disaster management and risk reduction efforts in their communities.

== Urban farming in cities and countries ==
Globalisation has been shaping this world into a small village. With this phenomenon comes urbanisation or massive urban planning that governments and private industries are advancing. With policies being created and governance being mandated, remote heartlands of countries are now slowly being transformed into urbanised places and spaces which in turn produce setbacks such as pollution, health issues and other social problems. However, one trend that is becoming popular in some countries is urban forestry which somehow demands for sound scientific information and public participation. According to Janse and Konijnendijk (2007), urban society&#x27;s manifold perceptions, preferences and demands for urban forest goods and services indicate the necessity for socially inclusive policy planning processes. They said that successful policies can only be formulated by establishing close links with, for example, urban planning and municipal policies. Inherently, this means that close ties between research and policy are required. They discussed the outcomes of the NeighbourWoods research and development project in which a wide range of tools for public participation were tested in six urban woodland case-studies across Europe. Findings confirmed that a set of tools comprising a step-wise process from informing the public in an attractive way, collecting information on public opinion, towards fully participatory approaches such as direct involvement in decision-making is most likely to ensure socially inclusive planning. Communication with policy-makers requires a high degree of openness, clearly explaining every phase of the process, being open about each other&#x27;s expectations, and developing relationships based on mutual trust (Janse &amp; Konijnendijk, 2007).

Despite power issues that lurk in most organisations and governments, Development Communication and policy sciences seem to advance specific and systematic functions to achieve a common goal for the benefit of the majority. This is shown in an increasingly global India, whereby an agricultural community in Pune, Maharashtra was faced with losing farmland to urbanisation and devised an unusual solution (Sami, 2013). Pooling their land together, the farmers in this community leveraged their social and political networks to take advantage of the changing economic climate in Pune and built a mixed-use township on their 400 acres of farmland (Sami, 2013). They formed alliances with other stakeholders, both internally within the agricultural community and externally at the city and state levels. Sami (2013) concluded that &quot;ad-hoc coalitions in the power and politics of urban processes in an Indian city have emerged as a result of a political will and leadership vacuum in Indian cities in the face of the changing focus and priorities of national and regional governments as well as a growing gap in urban service provision&quot; (p. 151).

== Communication for development (C4D) and e-Agriculture ==
If highly urbanised and wealthy cities or countries are advancing urban agriculture, it cannot be denied that many of the Third World countries are also at par when it comes to improving agricultural processes and policies and in the informatisation of agriculture. In Malawi, one of the poorest regions in Africa, Agunga (2012) emphasised that the success rate of poverty-reduction programming could be greater if C4D education was provided for development decision-makers and field staff, especially agricultural extension workers. Agunga (2012) further stated that agricultural extension education can impact development by focusing on how C4D can strengthen agricultural extension performance. He implied that educating policymakers about C4D will increase donor investments in pilot C4D projects, a strengthening of agricultural extension systems, and success of poverty-reduction programs (Agunga, 2012).

In the Philippines, a book by Flor (2007) entitled Development Communication Praxis discussed a rice scandal such that in the last quarter of 1990, the Philippines groaned as the price of rice and other commodities went up. Flor (2007) said: Rice farmers who were expected to gain from the situation were likewise disadvantaged. They were not able to sell their produce at reasonable prices. On one hand, their bumper crop entailed expensive inputs – certified high yielding varieties, irrigation, pesticides and fertilizer. On the other, middle men bought their harvest at cutthroat prices leaving them penniless and in debt... the nature of the rice industry is such that information, particularly market information, means money and power. For all practical purposes, the Philippine rice industry is controlled by a group of obscure Filipino-Chinese businessmen called the Binondo Rice Cartel... Employing a nationwide marketing network composed mainly of fellow Filipino-Chinese traders, the cartel has held a viselike grip over rice trading since the post World War II years that enable them to virtually dictate the buying price of dried paddy all over the country (pp. 114–115).What was done when this happened? Did development communication come into the picture? Was change sought? There were a few discussions on alternatives such as proper use of funds since it was observed that international donations for the agricultural farmers were spent more on the informatisation of agriculture (increasing need for computers, logistical aids, etc.) instead of investing into more practical and realistic methods to empower the farmers and improve their farming methods. Attention was also given to the rise of white-collar jobs which was cutting down the numbers of agricultural farmers tilling the land (Flor, 2007). The youths became more attracted to the life in the city and to seek for office or desk jobs than remain in the province and till the farm. With this, Flor (2007) suggested policy rationalisation: Rationalisation need not mean a reduction of monies awarded to the information sector. It primarily means the rearrangement of priorities and the increase of allotment to actual farming activities in the case of agriculture or to direct social services in the case of rural development. (p. 123).However, with the seemingly hegemonic influence of the internet and the impact of globalisation, the field of agriculture needs to adapt to radical changes in society for it to become sustainable. As policy sciences and development communication suggest, the goal of communication and policies is to empower individuals or groups, and this empowerment necessitates crucial adaptation to an ever-changing world. This brought agriculture into another layer: e-agriculture. What is e-agriculture? The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO, 2013) defined this as: &lt;block quote&gt;An emerging field focusing on the enhancement of agricultural and rural development through improved information and communication processes. More specifically, e-Agriculture involves the conceptualization, design, development, evaluation and application of innovative ways to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture (p. 1).

In a post on e-Agriculture webpage, Walter (2009), indicates that the Philippines has launched a Knowledge Working Towards Enhancing Agricultural Communities Program or K-Agrinet project with the aim to promoting the use of ICT to attain agricultural sustainability and competitiveness for the country&#x27;s farmers. The project is a collaborative effort amongst the country&#x27;s diverse agencies to utilize information technology (IT) as a tool to fast-track the dissemination of agriculture and natural resources information and technologies to farmers, upland dwellers, and rural entrepreneurs in the Philippines. The institutional key players in the agricultural and natural resource sectors are: (1) the e-Learning led by the Open Academy for Philippine Agriculture of the Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA-PhilRice) which focuses on e-extension and distance learning for agriculture extension workers; (2) the e-Consortia led by the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCARRD) which intensifies technology and knowledge generation and exchange amongst existing partner R&amp;D Institutions through improved ICT tools and applications; (3) the e-Farm also led by DOST-PCARRD that promotes e-commerce by initiating e- based farm to market opportunities through the FITS centers and their respective farmer-scientists; and lastly, (4) the e-Agrikultura led by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) and Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) tasked at mobilising and generating the participation of agrarian reform communities into the program (Walter, 2009, p. 1).

Indeed, the goal of C4D and e-agriculture is clear: to improve the lives of people especially the poor and the marginalised. This entails educating and empowering them for the impact of change to be sustainable.

== Women&#x27;s roles on development through advancing policies ==
Reports and studies show that women are mostly victims of many kinds of abuse. For instance, Kaunda (1990) described that a smallholder development strategy in Malawi, Africa puts emphasis on commercialization of agriculture, combined with decision making processes which are centralized in the bureaucracy, serving only to reproduce and perpetuate historical forms of social differentiation which are the basis of the women&#x27;s subordination and/or subjugation.

However, it can be seen in the past few decades that women have been successful in championing a cause and in letting their voices be heard in the society. Women from all walks of life have been engaging themselves into some development projects. For Instance, in the Philippines, the World Food Programme (WFP, 2012) launched a project in the Philippine island of Mindanao to helping women kick start agriculture in the region by providing them with the training they need to become successful farmers. This shows that women can be empowered and independent – two qualities that development communication and policy sciences are championing. HumanaPeopletoPeople (2012) is also promoting gender equality in India, whereby, to release the empowerment of women, the women in their communities have formed coalitions such as women self-help groups focusing on community projects. The women are empowered to bargain, to have economic influence, to earn money for improvement of health and education of the family and to gain a stronger social standing.

Either in the First World or in the Third World nations, a huge number of women are making a difference in a lot of fields with the goal to contribute to character and nation-building. In the field of developing women&#x27;s capacities to run and manage their small-medium enterprises (SMEs), Gail Romero, the founder and CEO for Collective Changes, has been providing effective technology platforms to business mentors for women&#x27;s SMEs in developing nations. Gail continues to drive support for empowering women in business and global recognition of the economic engine that women can provide to their nations. Gail is also Senior Advisor for MacKenzie-Romero Consulting, Executive Producer for Rainmakers TV and carried the title of Ambassador for Global Health for the American Cancer Society until August 2011. Gail has spent the last two decades creating and directing the development and integration of innovative economic ideas and campaigns and strategic alliances with policy makers to advance women in leadership throughout the world... She has held numerous corporate board positions for start-up companies and guided new social venture partnerships. She has served as a visiting professor and international speaker and presenter on social justice, women&#x27;s issues and education. Gail is a recent TED Prize nominee for her work to leverage technology to grow women&#x27;s business skills (&quot;Advancing Women in Leadership&quot;, 2014).Development communication and policy sciences have gone a long way to advancing the rights and freedom of people – children and youths, women, farmers, labourers, etc., with the goal that they become more informed and empowered to make decisions for themselves and their communities, to realise their full potential and to become a catalyst for change as Flor (2007) postulated.

== Agenda setting ==
Agenda setting is an important topic in the Development Communication and policy sciences because it sets problems and issues into policies. It sets the tone of how policies are crafted, based on the needs of the public. Equally important in this discussion is understanding the Agenda Setting Process by which problems and alternative solutions gain or lose public and elite attention (Birkland, 2011). It is in this area where individuals take collective action and vie for attention. According to Schattschneider (1960), groups that successfully describe a problem will also be the one to define the solutions to it, thereby prevailing in public debate.

Another idea offered by Schattschneider is the Theory of Group Mobilization &amp; Participation in Agenda Setting wherein the issues are more likely to be elevated to agenda status if the scope of conflict is broadened. There are 2 ways to broaden an issue:
# Groups go public by using symbols and images or;
# Groups to lose the first level of public interest appeal to a higher decision-making level.
When powerful groups lose control of the agenda, they are said to enter into policy debates to gain attention (Baumgartner &amp; Jones), while other groups do venue shopping and ally with those who are able to advance their issues.

Levels of Agenda

From the vast field of issues (Agenda Universe), groups push issues meriting public attention &quot;within the legitimate jurisdiction of existing governmental authority&quot; (Birkland, quoting Cobb and Elder), moving to the next level (Systemic Agenda). Ideas that gain active and serious consideration of decision/policy makers go the next level (Institutional Agenda). If acted upon, it reaches Decision Agenda—the last level in the policy making process. Within these levels there are push and pull actions that happen between and among interest groups in order to pursue or challenge such initiatives.

Process of Policy Development (also Stages of the Policy Cycle)

It includes the following activities that sets off creation of policies:
# Issue Framing – which is a technique of getting the issues on the policy maker&#x27;s agenda so that a problem is recognized and debated.
# Agenda setting as already discussed in previous paragraphs.
# Policy Formulation wherein proposed actions are articulated, debated and drafter into language.
# Advocacy &amp; policy dialogue which will involve and mobilize stakeholders and the public, and
# Data analysis which focuses on political costs and benefits.

<text>Lambda Lambda Lambda ( or Tri-Lambs) is a national collegiate co-ed social fraternity founded on January 15, 2006 on the main campus of the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. Tri-Lambs does not discriminate based on race, gender, religion, class, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

==History==
Inspired by the movies &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, Lambda Lambda Lambda is a small co-ed social fraternity, unaffiliated with the Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils, dedicated to the enjoyment and enrichment of pop culture and to the camaraderie of its members. The &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; was founded as a student group at the University of Connecticut on January 15, 2006 by ten members, nine male and one female. The fraternity was founded on changing what a fraternity is back to its original meaning. The &quot;openness of the fraternity&quot; leads it to be a place in which to create a &quot;network of support&quot; among its brothers and sisters.

The &quot;Beta chapter&quot; at SUNY Buffalo was chartered in the fall of 2008. This was followed by chapters at University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Western Washington University; and Bowie State University. Chapters that fail to induct new members became inactive, as occurred with the &quot;Beta chapter&quot;.

== Membership ==
Consistent with the founding ideals of the fraternity, Lambda Lambda Lambda has historically included a range of students in its ranks. Tri-Lambs does not discriminate based on race, gender, religion, class, gender identity, or sexual orientation. While each sister or brother is chosen to join the fraternity, the opportunity to rush is afforded to all students in a chapter&#x27;s jurisdiction, and selection is made based on that individual&#x27;s merits. 

Sisters and brothers of Lambda Lambda Lambda must be inducted by a chapter accredited by the national fraternity. Individual chapters may stipulate requirements for eligibility within the precepts of the mission of the organization. Typically, a group of students is selected from the pool of interested and eligible candidates by active members of the chapter. Following this selection these individuals learn about the organization before their formal induction into the fraternity.

== Governance ==
The fraternity is governed by the University of Connecticut&#x27;s &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;. A group of officers presides over all matters internally and externally with changes to the organization&#x27;s running being decided by majority vote at chapter meetings achieving a quorum of active sisters or brothers. The &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; is also responsible for colonization and induction of new chapters. Historically, a representative of the Alpha chapter has guided the first class of new chapters into the fraternity before that chapter embarks on the task of self-governance. 

==Chapters==
Following is a list of the chapters of Lambda Lambda Lambda. Active chapters are indicated in bold. Inactive chapters are indicated in &quot;italics&quot;.

Several rogue chapters have inducted themselves at a variety of institutions. The rogue chapter at Sacred Heart University has claimed the title of &quot;Zeta chapter&quot;. Tennessee Tech hosts a chapter that has claimed the name &quot;Pi chapter&quot;. These chapters and others are not sanctioned by Lambda Lambda Lambda National Fraternity. New chapters of Tri-Lambs become created through a process delineated by the national fraternity and administered by the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;.

<doc id="579414" wikidata="Q2991682" url="?curid=579414" title="Drug design">
<text>Drug design, often referred to as rational drug design or simply rational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein, which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design. In addition to small molecules, biopharmaceuticals including peptides and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed.

==Definition==
The phrase &quot;drug design&quot; is similar to ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, and side effects, that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and effictive drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques.

Due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug. Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to select compounds with more favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and toxicological profiles.

== Drug targets ==

A biomolecular target (most commonly a protein or a nucleic acid) is a key molecule involved in a particular metabolic or signaling pathway that is associated with a specific disease condition or pathology or to the infectivity or survival of a microbial pathogen. Potential drug targets are not necessarily disease causing but must by definition be disease modifying. In some cases, small molecules will be designed to enhance or inhibit the target function in the specific disease modifying pathway. Small molecules (for example receptor agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists, or modulators; enzyme activators or inhibitors; or ion channel openers or blockers) will be designed that are complementary to the binding site of target. Small molecules (drugs) can be designed so as not to affect any other important &quot;off-target&quot; molecules (often referred to as antitargets) since drug interactions with off-target molecules may lead to undesirable side effects. Due to similarities in binding sites, closely related targets identified through sequence homology have the highest chance of cross reactivity and hence highest side effect potential.

Most commonly, drugs are organic small molecules produced through chemical synthesis, but biopolymer-based drugs (also known as biopharmaceuticals) produced through biological processes are becoming increasingly more common. In addition, mRNA-based gene silencing technologies may have therapeutic applications. For example, nanomedicines based on mRNA can streamline and expedite the drug development process, enabling transient and localized expression of immunostimulatory molecules. In vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA allows for delivery to various accessible cell types via the blood or alternative pathways. The use of IVT mRNA serves to convey specific genetic information into a person&#x27;s cells, with the primary objective of preventing or altering a particular disease.

=== Drug discovery ===

====Phenotypic drug discovery====

Phenotypic drug discovery is a traditional drug discovery method, also known as forward pharmacology or classical pharmacology. It uses the process of phenotypic screening on collections of synthetic small molecules, natural products, or extracts within chemical libraries to pinpoint substances exhibiting beneficial therapeutic effects. This method is to first discover the in vivo or in vitro functional activity of drugs (such as extract drugs or natural products), and then perform target identification. Phenotypic discovery uses a practical and target-independent approach to generate initial leads, aiming to discover pharmacologically active compounds and therapeutics that operate through novel drug mechanisms. This method allows the exploration of disease phenotypes to find potential treatments for conditions with unknown, complex, or multifactorial origins, where the understanding of molecular targets is insufficient for effective intervention.

====Rational drug discovery====

Rational drug design (also called reverse pharmacology) begins with a hypothesis that modulation of a specific biological target may have therapeutic value. In order for a biomolecule to be selected as a drug target, two essential pieces of information are required. The first is evidence that modulation of the target will be disease modifying. This knowledge may come from, for example, disease linkage studies that show an association between mutations in the biological target and certain disease states. The second is that the target is capable of binding to a small molecule and that its activity can be modulated by the small molecule.

Once a suitable target has been identified, the target is normally cloned and produced and purified. The purified protein is then used to establish a screening assay. In addition, the three-dimensional structure of the target may be determined.

The search for small molecules that bind to the target is begun by screening libraries of potential drug compounds. This may be done by using the screening assay (a &quot;wet screen&quot;). In addition, if the structure of the target is available, a virtual screen may be performed of candidate drugs. Ideally, the candidate drug compounds should be &quot;drug-like&quot;, that is they should possess properties that are predicted to lead to oral bioavailability, adequate chemical and metabolic stability, and minimal toxic effects. Several methods are available to estimate druglikeness such as Lipinski&#x27;s Rule of Five and a range of scoring methods such as lipophilic efficiency. Several methods for predicting drug metabolism have also been proposed in the scientific literature.

Due to the large number of drug properties that must be simultaneously optimized during the design process, multi-objective optimization techniques are sometimes employed. Finally because of the limitations in the current methods for prediction of activity, drug design is still very much reliant on serendipity and bounded rationality.

== Computer-aided drug design ==

The most fundamental goal in drug design is to predict whether a given molecule will bind to a target and if so how strongly. Molecular mechanics or molecular dynamics is most often used to estimate the strength of the intermolecular interaction between the small molecule and its biological target. These methods are also used to predict the conformation of the small molecule and to model conformational changes in the target that may occur when the small molecule binds to it. Semi-empirical, ab initio quantum chemistry methods, or density functional theory are often used to provide optimized parameters for the molecular mechanics calculations and also provide an estimate of the electronic properties (electrostatic potential, polarizability, etc.) of the drug candidate that will influence binding affinity.

Molecular mechanics methods may also be used to provide semi-quantitative prediction of the binding affinity. Also, knowledge-based scoring function may be used to provide binding affinity estimates. These methods use linear regression, machine learning, neural nets or other statistical techniques to derive predictive binding affinity equations by fitting experimental affinities to computationally derived interaction energies between the small molecule and the target.

Ideally, the computational method will be able to predict affinity before a compound is synthesized and hence in theory only one compound needs to be synthesized, saving enormous time and cost. The reality is that present computational methods are imperfect and provide, at best, only qualitatively accurate estimates of affinity. In practice, it requires several iterations of design, synthesis, and testing before an optimal drug is discovered. Computational methods have accelerated discovery by reducing the number of iterations required and have often provided novel structures.

Computer-aided drug design may be used at any of the following stages of drug discovery:
# hit identification using virtual screening (structure- or ligand-based design)
# hit-to-lead optimization of affinity and selectivity (structure-based design, QSAR, etc.)
# lead optimization of other pharmaceutical properties while maintaining affinity
In order to overcome the insufficient prediction of binding affinity calculated by recent scoring functions, the protein-ligand interaction and compound 3D structure information are used for analysis. For structure-based drug design, several post-screening analyses focusing on protein-ligand interaction have been developed for improving enrichment and effectively mining potential candidates:
* Consensus scoring
** Selecting candidates by voting of multiple scoring functions
** May lose the relationship between protein-ligand structural information and scoring criterion
* Cluster analysis
** Represent and cluster candidates according to protein-ligand 3D information
** Needs meaningful representation of protein-ligand interactions.

== Types ==

There are two major types of drug design. The first is referred to as ligand-based drug design and the second, structure-based drug design.

=== Ligand-based ===

Ligand-based drug design (or &quot;indirect drug design&quot;) relies on knowledge of other molecules that bind to the biological target of interest. These other molecules may be used to derive a pharmacophore model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target. A model of the biological target may be built based on the knowledge of what binds to it, and this model in turn may be used to design new molecular entities that interact with the target. Alternatively, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), in which a correlation between calculated properties of molecules and their experimentally determined biological activity, may be derived. These QSAR relationships in turn may be used to predict the activity of new analogs.

=== Structure-based ===

Structure-based drug design (or &quot;direct drug design&quot;) relies on knowledge of the three dimensional structure of the biological target obtained through methods such as x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. If an experimental structure of a target is not available, it may be possible to create a homology model of the target based on the experimental structure of a related protein. Using the structure of the biological target, candidate drugs that are predicted to bind with high affinity and selectivity to the target may be designed using interactive graphics and the intuition of a medicinal chemist. Alternatively, various automated computational procedures may be used to suggest new drug candidates.

Current methods for structure-based drug design can be divided roughly into three main categories. The first method is identification of new ligands for a given receptor by searching large databases of 3D structures of small molecules to find those fitting the binding pocket of the receptor using fast approximate docking programs. This method is known as virtual screening.

A second category is de novo design of new ligands. In this method, ligand molecules are built up within the constraints of the binding pocket by assembling small pieces in a stepwise manner. These pieces can be either individual atoms or molecular fragments. The key advantage of such a method is that novel structures, not contained in any database, can be suggested. A third method is the optimization of known ligands by evaluating proposed analogs within the binding cavity.

==== Binding site identification ====

Binding site identification is the first step in structure based design. If the structure of the target or a sufficiently similar homolog is determined in the presence of a bound ligand, then the ligand should be observable in the structure in which case location of the binding site is trivial. However, there may be unoccupied allosteric binding sites that may be of interest. Furthermore, it may be that only (protein without ligand) structures are available and the reliable identification of unoccupied sites that have the potential to bind ligands with high affinity is non-trivial. In brief, binding site identification usually relies on identification of surfaces on the protein that can accommodate drug sized molecules that also possess appropriate &quot;hot spots&quot; (hydrophobic surfaces, hydrogen bonding sites, etc.) that drive ligand binding.

==== Scoring functions ====

Structure-based drug design attempts to use the structure of proteins as a basis for designing new ligands by applying the principles of molecular recognition. Selective high affinity binding to the target is generally desirable since it leads to more efficacious drugs with fewer side effects. Thus, one of the most important principles for designing or obtaining potential new ligands is to predict the binding affinity of a certain ligand to its target (and known antitargets) and use the predicted affinity as a criterion for selection.
One early general-purposed empirical scoring function to describe the binding energy of ligands to receptors was developed by Böhm. This empirical scoring function took the form:

formula_1

where:
* ΔG0 – empirically derived offset that in part corresponds to the overall loss of translational and rotational entropy of the ligand upon binding.
* ΔGhb – contribution from hydrogen bonding
* ΔGionic – contribution from ionic interactions
* ΔGlip – contribution from lipophilic interactions where |Alipo| is surface area of lipophilic contact between the ligand and receptor
* ΔGrot – entropy penalty due to freezing a rotatable in the ligand bond upon binding

A more general thermodynamic &quot;master&quot; equation is as follows:

formula_2

where:
* desolvation – enthalpic penalty for removing the ligand from solvent
* motion – entropic penalty for reducing the degrees of freedom when a ligand binds to its receptor
* configuration – conformational strain energy required to put the ligand in its &quot;active&quot; conformation
* interaction – enthalpic gain for &quot;resolvating&quot; the ligand with its receptor

The basic idea is that the overall binding free energy can be decomposed into independent components that are known to be important for the binding process. Each component reflects a certain kind of free energy alteration during the binding process between a ligand and its target receptor. The Master Equation is the linear combination of these components. According to Gibbs free energy equation, the relation between dissociation equilibrium constant, Kd, and the components of free energy was built.

Various computational methods are used to estimate each of the components of the master equation. For example, the change in polar surface area upon ligand binding can be used to estimate the desolvation energy. The number of rotatable bonds frozen upon ligand binding is proportional to the motion term. The configurational or strain energy can be estimated using molecular mechanics calculations. Finally the interaction energy can be estimated using methods such as the change in non polar surface, statistically derived potentials of mean force, the number of hydrogen bonds formed, etc. In practice, the components of the master equation are fit to experimental data using multiple linear regression. This can be done with a diverse training set including many types of ligands and receptors to produce a less accurate but more general &quot;global&quot; model or a more restricted set of ligands and receptors to produce a more accurate but less general &quot;local&quot; model.

== Examples ==

A particular example of rational drug design involves the use of three-dimensional information about biomolecules obtained from such techniques as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Computer-aided drug design in particular becomes much more tractable when there is a high-resolution structure of a target protein bound to a potent ligand. This approach to drug discovery is sometimes referred to as structure-based drug design. The first unequivocal example of the application of structure-based drug design leading to an approved drug is the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor dorzolamide, which was approved in 1995.

Another case study in rational drug design is imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed specifically for the &quot;bcr-abl&quot; fusion protein that is characteristic for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias (chronic myelogenous leukemia and occasionally acute lymphocytic leukemia). Imatinib is substantially different from previous drugs for cancer, as most agents of chemotherapy simply target rapidly dividing cells, not differentiating between cancer cells and other tissues.

Additional examples include:
* Many of the atypical antipsychotics
* Cimetidine, the prototypical H2-receptor antagonist from which the later members of the class were developed
* Selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs
* Enfuvirtide, a peptide HIV entry inhibitor
* Nonbenzodiazepines like zolpidem and zopiclone
* Raltegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor
* SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), a class of antidepressants
* Zanamivir, an antiviral drug
== Drug screening ==
Types of drug screening include phenotypic screening, high-throughput screening, and virtual screening. Phenotypic screening is characterized by the process of screening drugs using cellular or animal disease models to identify compounds that alter the phenotype and produce beneficial disease-related effects. Emerging technologies in high-throughput screening substantially enhance processing speed and decrease the required detection volume. Virtual screening is completed by computer, enabling a large number of molecules can be screened with a short cycle and low cost. Virtual screening uses a range of computational methods that empower chemists to reduce extensive virtual libraries into more manageable sizes.

==Case studies==

* 5-HT3 antagonists
* Acetylcholine receptor agonists
* Angiotensin receptor antagonists
* Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitors
* Cannabinoid receptor antagonists
* CCR5 receptor antagonists
* Cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors
* Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors
* HIV protease inhibitors
* NK1 receptor antagonists
* Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
* Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors
* PDE5 inhibitors
* Proton pump inhibitors
* Renin inhibitors
* Triptans
* TRPV1 antagonists
* c-Met inhibitors
== Criticism ==
It has been argued that the highly rigid and focused nature of rational drug design suppresses serendipity in drug discovery.

<text>John Obadiah Westwood (22 December 1805 – 2 January 1893) was an English entomologist and archaeologist noted for his artistic talents. He published several illustrated works on insects and antiquities. He was among the first entomologists with an academic position at Oxford University. He was a natural theologian, staunchly anti-Darwinian, and sometimes adopted a quinarian viewpoint. Although he never travelled widely, he described species from around the world on the basis of specimens, especially of the larger, curious, and colourful species obtained by naturalists and collectors in England.

== Life and work ==


John Obadiah Westwood was born into a Quaker family in Sheffield, the son of medal and die maker, John Westwood (1774–1850) and Mary, daughter of Edward Betts. He went to school at the Friends&#x27; School, Sheffield and later at Lichfield when the family moved there. He apprenticed briefly to become a solicitor and worked briefly as a partner in a firm but gave up a career in law for his interests. In his spare time he studied Anglo-Saxon and medieval manuscripts and earned a living by illustrating and writing. His early works included reproductions of old manuscripts and illuminations. In 1824, he met the entomologist Reverend Frederick William Hope for the first time and they were close friends. In 1833, Westwood and Hope were founding members of the Entomological Society of London and Westwood served as its secretary in 1834. In the same year, Hope had his insect collections organized by Westwood. This allowed Westwood to examine and describe insects from around the world. 

When Hope decided to gift away his collections to Oxford University in 1849 he got Westwood to be appointed a curator of the collections. Westwood was appointed in 1857 and he donated his own insect specimens to the Hope Collection. Hope worked on setting up a new zoology chair endowed an entomological position in Oxford University, Westwood was the first nominee and selected as Hope professor in 1861. He received an MA by decree in 1861 and joined Magdalen College, Oxford. Among the prominent writers and naturalists he associated with was James Rennie, whom he assisted in the editing of Gilbert White&#x27;s &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot; in 1833. In his early writings he was influenced by the quinarian system, but tended to be a general natural theologian. Although he worked on insect classification and diversity for more than thirty years from the publication of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;, he never accepted ideas on evolution. Darwin even suspected that an anonymous author of a bad review of his book in the &quot;Athenæum&quot; to have been Westwood. That review was however by John Leifchild although Westwood remained a critic of Darwin to the extent that he proposed a &quot;permanent endowment of a lecturer [at Oxford] to combat the errors of Darwinism&quot;. He considered mimetic resemblances of insects as freaks of nature. Westwood was succeeded in the Hope chair by E.B. Poulton who adopted evolutionary views. Westwood was among the first to attempt an estimate of the total number of species of insects which he put at half a million.

== Family, learned societies and later life ==

In 1839, Westwood married Eliza Richardson (&quot;d&quot;. 1882), who accompanied him on all his archæological tours, and who assisted in making sketches and rubbings of the inscribed stones for his &quot;&#x27;Lapidarium Walliæ&quot;.&#x27; Westwood was a Fellow of the Linnean Society (elected 1827) and president of the Entomological Society of London (1852–1853). He received the Royal Society&#x27;s medal, based on recommendations from many including Darwin, in 1855 for his work on insects. In 1883 he was honoured in the Jubilee year of the Entomological Society as honorary life president of the society. He was also on the staff of the &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Chronicle&quot; serving as a bridge between gardeners and entomologists. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1883.

A fall in 1884 led to an arm injury that ended his studies. On 30 December 1892, not long after returning home from a convention in London, Westwood had suddenly collapsed of a cerebral haemorrhage, which left him hospitalised. He slipped into a coma one day later and died on 2 January 1893. His funeral took place on 6 January 1893, and he was interred in St Sepulchre&#x27;s Cemetery, Oxford.

== Legacy ==

The J. O. Westwood Medal, awarded every two years by the Royal Entomological Society, is named in his honour. The ichneumon wasp genus &quot;Westwoodia&quot; was erected by Brullé in 1846. A vestry in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Sandford-on-Thames was constructed in 1893 in his honour.

<text>John Timothy Irvine Porteous, CM (August 31, 1933 – February 11, 2020) was a Canadian administrator.

==Student days==
A native of Montreal, he studied at Bishop&#x27;s College School, Selwyn House School and McGill University, where he earned both a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of civil law. Porteous first met Pierre Trudeau in 1957 when the two were students traveling in West Africa for a World University Service of Canada seminar, for which Porteous represented McGill, where he had previously been responsible for the outstanding 1957 student production of &quot;My Fur Lady&quot;, which he co-wrote.

==Early career==
He and Trudeau remained friends and became even closer when Porteous took a two-year leave of absence from his law practice in 1966 and went to Ottawa to work as an executive assistant to Treasury Board president Charles Drury, before volunteering as a speechwriter on Trudeau&#x27;s 1968 leadership campaign.

He is credited with introducing Trudeau to Margaret Sinclair, who Trudeau later married.

When Trudeau won the Liberal Party leadership campaign, on becoming Prime Minister later in 1968 he offered Porteous a job as his executive assistant, a position he held for five years. After his time in government, Porteous went on to head both the Canada Council and the Ontario College of Art and Design.

==Canada Council==
Porteous was perhaps best known for his 12-year tenure as associate director and director of the Canada Council. He was appointed to be a Member of the Order of Canada in October 2003, in recognition of his public service.

<text>HMS &quot;Onyx&quot; was an of the Royal Navy.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was a direct follow on of the &quot;Porpoise&quot; class, with the same dimensions and external design, but updates to equipment and internal fittings, and a higher grade of steel used for fabrication of the pressure hull.

As designed for British service, the &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines were in length between perpendiculars and in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . Displacement was 1,610 tons standard, 2,030 tons full load when surfaced, and 2,410 tons full load when submerged. Propulsion machinery consisted of two Admiralty Standard Range 16 VMS diesel generators, and two electric motors, each driving a three-bladed propeller at up to 400 rpm. Top speed was when submerged, and on the surface. Eight diameter torpedo tubes were fitted (six facing forward, two aft), with a total payload of 24 torpedoes. The boats were fitted with Type 186 and Type 187 sonars, and an I-band surface search radar. The standard complement was 68: 6 officers, 62 sailors.

&quot;Onyx&quot; was laid down by Cammell Laird on 16 November 1964, and launched on 18 August 1966. During &quot;Onyx&quot;″s construction there was an explosion which took the life of a shipyard worker and severely wounded communist union leader Barry Williams. The boat was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 20 November 1967. &quot;Onyx&quot; was ordered after a previous &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarine of the same name (laid down by Chatham Dockyard in 1962) was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as before launching in February 1964.

==Operational history==

The first commission of &quot;Onyx&quot; saw her visit Swansea in South Wales for the investiture of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales. She also attended the bicentennial celebrations of the United States of America in 1976.

===Falklands War===
&quot;Onyx&quot; was the only non-nuclear submarine of the Royal Navy to take part in the Falklands War.The diesel submarine went south with a special 5 man diving chamber and fully armed with 10 MK 24, 2 Mk 20 and 11 Mk 8 torpedoes 

&quot;Onyx&quot; was tasked with providing reconnaissance photographs of enemy installations enforcing the exclusion zone around the Falklands. Her smaller displacement compared to the nuclear submarines also made her ideal for landing SBS and SAS special forces, picked up from Ascension Island, ashore on the islands in shallow waters. The charts used for these landings, however, were made 200 years before the war.

During one of these missions, &quot;Onyx&quot; hit an uncharted pinnacle while submerged at and suffered minor damage to her bow. Another claim is that the damage was inflicted by one of two torpedoes dropped by an Argentine Navy S-2E Tracker aircraft from operating off the Argentine coast. The Tracker S-2 twice detected sub-surface and electronic traces and a magnetic anomaly detector contact on 5–6 May while searching for which was out of contact after being hit by Sea Skua missiles launched by Westland Lynx helicopters.

Contrary to some reports, after the British cancelled Operation Mikado, there was never a plan to use &quot;Onyx&quot; to land the SAS in order to destroy Argentina&#x27;s remaining stockpile of Exocet missiles. Prior to the submarine being damaged the SBS had been embarked to attack a mainland airfield but this operation, too, was cancelled.

Postwar, &quot;Onyx&quot; sank the hulk of the landing ship with a Mk 8 Torpedo after firing two Mk 24 Tigerfish, the second Tigerfish, after a ten-minute delay, at the hulk; both failed to explode probably due to torpedo battery faults. &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; had been damaged beyond repair during an Argentine Air Force raid at Fitzroy and Bluff Cove.

==Decommissioning and preservation attempts==

Defence cuts in the UK saw the Royal Navy dispense with its diesel-powered submarines to concentrate on nuclear attack submarines. In 1991, &quot;Onyx&quot; was decommissioned from the navy. She was then cared for by the Warship Preservation Trust and was on public display alongside several other ships in Birkenhead, UK.

In May 2006, &quot;Onyx&quot; was sold to the Barrow-in-Furness businessman Joe Mullen, for a reported £100,000 as a &#x27;gift to the people of Barrow&#x27;. She left Birkenhead on 13 June 2006 to form the centrepiece of The Submarine Heritage Centre, a new heritage museum in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, as a celebration to the town&#x27;s illustrious submarine-building history.

After the submarine museum went into debt she was taken by an unknown liquidation company as a financial asset, to be broken up for scrap. A small party from HMS &quot;Exploit&quot; gave her a send off recognising her contribution to the Navy and country in the Cold War and Falklands conflict. On 30 April 2014 she was sailed from Barrow in tow for the Clyde and berthed at Rosneath amid continued uncertainty as to whether at least part of &quot;Onyx&quot; might be preserved. &quot;Onyx&quot; was alongside Rosneath Jetty on the Gare Loch, Scotland on 18 July 2014. She was scrapped in Rosneath later that year.

<doc id="579430" wikidata="Q15816787" url="?curid=579430" title="Parliaments of the Australian states and territories">
<text>The parliaments of the Australian states and territories are legislative bodies within the federal framework of the Commonwealth of Australia.

All the parliaments are based on the Westminster system, and each is regulated by its own constitution. Queensland and the two territories have unicameral parliaments, with the single house being called the Legislative Assembly. The other states have a bicameral parliament, with a lower house called the Legislative Assembly (New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia) or House of Assembly (South Australia and Tasmania), and an upper house called the Legislative Council.

Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia prevents persons with dual citizenship from being members of the Federal Parliament, but there are no laws preventing holders of dual citizenship being members of State Parliaments.

==Background==
Before the formation of the Commonwealth in 1901, the six Australian colonies were self-governing colonies, with parliaments which had come into existence at various times between 1825, when the New South Wales Legislative Council was created, to 1891, when Western Australia became the last of the colonies to gain full self-government.

The colonies ratified the Constitution of Australia, becoming States of the Commonwealth in the new federation, and ceding certain of their legislative powers to the Commonwealth Parliament, but otherwise retaining their self-governing status with their own constitutions and parliaments. The state parliaments were all created by legislation of the British Imperial Parliament, and their original constitutions were contained in Acts of that Parliament; however now the power to amend state constitutions resides with the respective state parliaments, in accordance with its constitution. The Commonwealth Parliament cannot amend a state&#x27;s constitution.

The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, by contrast, are territories of the Commonwealth, and their parliaments were created by way of legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament. Although the Commonwealth treats the territories as though they were states for many purposes, they are not states, and the legislative powers of their parliaments can be altered or even abolished by the Commonwealth Parliament. The Commonwealth can also overturn legislation passed by the territory parliaments.

== Overview ==

==States and territories==

===New South Wales===

The Parliament of New South Wales is a bicameral legislature comprising the New South Wales Legislative Council, the Legislative Assembly and the King, represented by the Governor of New South Wales. The Legislative Council has 42 members elected for eight-year terms with half the members facing re-election every four years. The Legislative Council cannot block appropriation bills. They are elected by proportional voting with the whole state being one electorate. The Legislative Assembly has 93 members elected for four-year terms from single-member constituencies, using optional preferential voting.

===Victoria===

The Parliament of Western Australia is a bicameral legislature comprising the Western Australian Legislative Council, the Legislative Assembly and the King, represented by the Governor of Western Australia. The Legislative Council has 36 members, elected for fixed four-year terms from six multi-member electoral regions by &quot;community of interest&quot; —3 metropolitan and 3 rural—each electing 6 members by proportional voting. There is a significant malapportionment in the Legislative Council in favour of rural regions. The Legislative Assembly has 59 members, elected for fixed four-year terms from single-member constituencies, using preferential voting. Voting is compulsory, with elections being held every four years on the second Saturday in March, though the term of the Legislative Council does not expire until May after the election.

===Northern Territory===

The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is a unicameral legislature. The Legislative Assembly has 25 members, elected for four-year terms from single-member constituencies, using preferential voting. The head of government is called the Chief Minister, while the Administrator of the Northern Territory (appointed by the federal government) forms a similar role to state governors in providing assent to legislation.

===Norfolk Island===

In the external territory of Norfolk Island located in the South Pacific Ocean, the local legislative body is the Norfolk Island Regional Council, established in 2016. The island was previously governed by a Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. Formed after the Norfolk Island Act 1979 was passed in the Australian parliament, its first members were elected on the tenth of August 1979. The assembly consisted of 9 members elected every three years by popular vote. It was abolished in June 2015 as part of a reorganisation of the territory&#x27;s government by the Parliament of Australia.

===Christmas Island===

In the external territory of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, the Shire Council provides local governance. The nine-member Shire Council was established in 1993. Councilors serve four-year terms, with four or five being chosen every second year.

===Cocos (Keeling) Islands===

In the external territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean, the Shire of Cocos is the local legislative body. Established in 1993, the Shire Council consists of 7 members serving terms of four years. Elections for half the seats are held every two years.

<doc id="579432" wikidata="Q3244676" url="?curid=579432" title="New South Wales Legislative Council">
<text>The New South Wales Legislative Council, often referred to as the upper house, is one of the two chambers of the parliament of the Australian state of New South Wales. Along with the Legislative Assembly, it sits at Parliament House in the state capital, Sydney. It is normal for legislation to be first deliberated on and passed by the Legislative Assembly before being considered by the Legislative Council, which acts in the main as a house of review.

The Legislative Council has 42 members, elected by proportional representation in which the whole state is a single electorate. Members serve eight-year terms, which are staggered, with half the Council being elected every four years, roughly coinciding with elections to the Legislative Assembly.

==History==
The parliament of New South Wales is Australia&#x27;s oldest legislature. It had its beginnings when New South Wales was a British colony under the control of the Governor, and was first established by the &quot;New South Wales Act 1823&quot;. A small, 5-member appointed Legislative Council began meeting on 25 August 1824 to advise the Governor on legislative matters. It grew to seven members in 1825, and between ten and fifteen in 1829. Under the &quot;Electoral Act 1843&quot;, the Legislative Council was expanded to 36 members, of whom 12 were appointed by the Governor in the name of the Crown, and the remainder elected from among eligible landholders. This change partly incorporated William Wentworth&#x27;s ideals of self government proposed through the Australian Patriotic Association. Following the passage into law of &quot;The Electoral Act 1851&quot;, the Council was enlarged to 54 members with 36 of its members elected by adult males who met certain property requirements and 18 appointed members. 
In 1856, under a new Constitution, the Parliament became bicameral with a fully elected Legislative Assembly and a fully appointed Legislative Council with a Government taking over most of the legislative powers of the Governor. The right to vote was extended to all adult males in 1858.

On 22 May 1856, the newly constituted New South Wales Parliament opened and sat for the first time. With the new 54-member Legislative Assembly taking over the council chamber, a second meeting chamber for the 21-member upper house had to be added to the Parliament building in Macquarie Street. In 1901, New South Wales became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia and many government functions were transferred to the new Commonwealth government. In 1902, women gained the right to vote and the current Constitution of New South Wales was adopted, and in 1918, reforms permitted women to be members of parliament.

In 1925, 1926 and 1929, Premier Jack Lang made attempts to abolish the Legislative Council, following the example of the Queensland Legislative Council in 1922, but all were unsuccessful. The debate did, however, result in another round of reforms, and in 1933, the law was changed so that a quarter of the Legislative Council was elected every three years by votes cast by members of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council together, using STV, rather than being appointed by the Governor. 

In 1962, Indigenous Australians gained the unfettered right to vote in all state elections, overriding protection orders and other historical restrictions on some Aboriginal people voting. 

In 1978, the Council became a directly elected body in a program of electoral reform introduced by the Wran Labor government. The number of members was reduced to 45, with a third elected each third year, although transitional arrangements meant that there were 43 members from 1978 to 1981, and 44 from 1981 to 1984. 

Further reform in 1991 by the Greiner Liberal-National government saw the size of the Legislative Council cut to 42 members, with half being elected every 4 years. (In 1991, the NSW Legislative Assembly was reduced from 109 to 99 Members, and then to 93 members in 1999.)

As with the federal parliament and other Australian states and territories, voting in the election to select members for the council is compulsory for all New South Wales citizens over the age of 18. As the result of a 1995 referendum, every four years half the seats in the Council come up for election on the fourth Saturday in March, barring exceptional circumstances.
=== Opening of parliament ===

The King of Australia has a throne in the Legislative Council. Queen Elizabeth II opened the New South Wales Parliament on two occasions. The first was on 4 February 1954, as part of her first visit to Australia. It was the first time that the monarch of Australia had opened a session of any Australian parliament. The other occasion was on 20 February 1992, during her visit to Sydney to celebrate the sesquicentenary of the incorporation of the City of Sydney, on which occasion she stated: 

===Presidency of the Legislative Council===

From 1846 to 1856 the title of the presiding officer was &quot;Speaker of the Legislative Council&quot;, and after that date it has been &quot;President of the Legislative Council&quot;.

The Legislative Council chamber is a prefabricated cast-iron building, intended as an &quot;iron store and dwelling with ornamental front&quot;, which had been manufactured in Scotland and shipped to Victoria. In 1856, when plans for a new chamber for the Legislative Council were not ready in time, this building was purchased and shipped to Sydney, where it was erected as an extension to Parliament House. The Legislative Council chamber is furnished in red, which follows the British tradition for the upper house.

==Composition and powers==
Proportional representation, with the whole state as a single electorate, means that the quota for election is small. This almost guarantees the representation of minor parties in the Legislative Council, including micro-parties that might attract less than 2% of the primary vote but are elected through preferences.

In the 1999 elections, a record number of parties contested seats in the council, resulting in an unwieldy ballot paper (referred to as the &quot;table cloth&quot; ballot paper), and a complex exchange of preferences between the numerous parties running candidates. As a result, party registration requirements have since been made more restrictive (e.g., requiring more voters as members, and a larger number of candidates to become eligible for a simple &quot;above-the-line&quot; voting box), and the replacement of party preference arrangements with optional preferential voting. This reduced the number of parties contesting elections and increased the difficulty for small, upstart parties to be elected, so that only six minor parties are now represented in the council (the Greens; One Nation; Shooters, Fishers and Farmers; Animal Justice; Legalise Cannabis and Liberal Democrats), along with Labor, Liberal, and National Party members.

==Current distribution of seats (2023–2027)==


The President of the Legislative Council has a casting vote should the result be equal from among those present eligible and choosing to vote. With 42 members, with one removed as president, a majority is 21 of the 41 possible of the whole 42.

Section 22I of the NSW Constitution states that &quot;All questions arising in the Legislative Council shall be decided by a majority of the votes of the Members present other than the President or other Member presiding and when the votes are equal the President or other Member presiding shall have a casting vote.&quot;

<text>The New South Wales Legislative Assembly is the lower of the two houses of the Parliament of New South Wales, an Australian state. The upper house is the New South Wales Legislative Council. Both the Assembly and Council sit at Parliament House in the state capital, Sydney. The Assembly is presided over by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly.

The Assembly has 93 members, elected by single-member constituency, which are commonly known as seats. Voting is by the optional preferential system.
Members of the Legislative Assembly have the post-nominals MP after their names.
From the creation of the assembly up to about 1990, the post-nominals &quot;MLA&quot; (Member of the Legislative Assembly) were used.

The Assembly is often called &quot;the bearpit&quot; on the basis of the house&#x27;s reputation for confrontational style during heated moments and the &quot;savage political theatre and the bloodlust of its professional players&quot; attributed in part to executive dominance.

==History==

The Legislative Assembly was created in 1856 with the introduction of a bicameral parliament for the Crown Colony of New South Wales, a process led in the Legislative Council by William Wentworth. In the beginning, only men were eligible to be members of the Assembly, and only around one half of men were able to pass the property or income qualifications required to vote. Two years later, the Electoral Reform Act, which was passed despite the opposition of the Legislative Council, saw the introduction of a far more democratic system, allowing any man who had been resident in the colony for six months the right to vote, and removing property requirements to stand as a candidate. Following Australia&#x27;s federation in 1901, the New South Wales parliament became a State legislature. Women were granted the right to vote in 1902, and gained the right to be members of the Assembly in 1918, with the first successful candidate being elected in 1925.

==Chamber==
The Legislative Assembly sits in the oldest legislative chamber in Australia. Originally built for the Legislative Council in 1843, it has been in continuous use since 1856. The colour of the Legislative Assembly chamber is green, which follows the British tradition for lower houses.

==Function==
Most legislation is initiated in the Legislative Assembly. The party or coalition with a majority of seats in the lower house is invited by the Governor to form government. The leader of that party subsequently becomes Premier of New South Wales, and their senior colleagues become ministers responsible for various portfolios. As Australian political parties traditionally vote along party lines, most legislation introduced by the governing party will pass through the Legislative Assembly.

As with the federal parliament and other Australian states and territories, voting in the Assembly is compulsory for all those over the age of 18. Elections are held every four years on the fourth Saturday in March, as the result of a 1995 referendum to amend the New South Wales Constitution. An early election can only be held if the government fails a vote of no confidence and no alternative government can command a vote of confidence. The Legislative Assembly may also be dissolved on the advice of the Premier or the Executive Council.

==Current distribution of seats==

* 47 votes as a majority are required to pass legislation.

==Administrative officers==

===Clerk===
The clerk of the house of the NSW Legislative Assembly is the senior administrative officer. The clerk advises the speaker of the Assembly and members of parliament on matters of parliamentary procedure and management. The office is modelled on the clerk of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The following have served as clerks:
*Richard O’Connor 
*Charles Thompson 
*Oliver Kelly 
*Stephen Jones 
*Frederick Webb CMG 
*Richard Arnold 
*William Mowle 
*Sydney Boydell 
*William Rupert McCourt CMG

*Harry Robbins MC 
*Allan Pickering CBE 
*Ivor Vidler CBE 
*Ronald Ward 
*Douglas Wheeler 
*Grahame Cooksley 
*Russell Grove PSM 
*Ronda Miller 
*Helen Minnican

===Serjeant-at-arms===
The ceremonial duties of the serjeant-at-arms are as the custodian of the mace, the symbol of the authority of the House and the speaker, and as the messenger for formal messages from the Legislative Assembly to the Legislative Council. The serjeant has the authority to remove disorderly people, by force if necessary, from the Assembly or the public or press galleries on the instructions of the speaker. The administrative duties of the serjeant include allocation of office accommodation, furniture and fittings for members&#x27; offices, co-ordination of car transport for members, mail and courier services for the House, security for the House and arrangements for school visits. Once a meeting has started in an Assembly, the serjeant will usually stand at the door to keep authority and make sure no one else comes in or out. The following have served as serjeant-at-arms:
*Laurence Joseph Harnett 
*John Mackenzie Webb
*Harry Robbins
*Ivor Percy Kidd Vidler
*Hubert Pierre Scarlett
*Ronald Edward Ward
*Frederick Augustine Mahony 
*William Geoffery Luton 
*Peter John McHugh

<text>The Victorian Legislative Council is the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Victoria, Australia, the lower house being the Legislative Assembly. Both houses sit at Parliament House in Spring Street, Melbourne. The Legislative Council serves as a house of review, in a similar fashion to its federal counterpart, the Australian Senate. Although it is possible for legislation to be first introduced in the Council, most bills receive their first hearing in the Legislative Assembly.

The presiding officer of the chamber is the President of the Legislative Council. The Council presently comprises 40 members serving four-year terms from eight electoral regions each with five members. With each region electing 5 members using the single transferable vote, the quota in each region for election, after distribution of preferences, is 16.7% (one-sixth). Ballot papers for elections for the Legislative Council have above and below the line voting. Voting above the line requires only a &#x27;1&#x27; being placed in one box, and group voting tickets voting has applied since 1988. Semi-optional voting is available if a voter votes below the line.

The Chamber of the Legislative Council is noticeably red - all carpet and furnishings in the chamber are red, which is a symbol of royalty and nobility. This aesthetic is in line with the United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Lords.

== History ==
===First Legislative Council ===

The separate colony of Victoria was proclaimed on 1 July 1851 and writs for the election of the first Legislative Council were issued at the same time for the 20 elected members. The Legislative Council initially consisted of 30 members, 10 of whom were nominated by the Lieutenant-Governor and 20 were elected from 16 &quot;electoral districts&quot;, with Melbourne electing three members, and Geelong and the county of Bourke electing two members each. The electors were male British subjects over the age of 21 years, who owned freehold valued at £100 or a householder paying rent of £10 per year, both very large sums at the time. Members of the Legislative Council were unpaid, further restricting participation of those without independent means. It took some time before the Legislative Council was elected and ready to sit. The Legislative Council met for the first time in November 1851 at St Patrick&#x27;s Hall, which had been built in 1847 in Bourke Street, Melbourne. The Legislative Council sat there until the opening of the Parliament House in 1856. James Frederick Palmer was the presiding officer of the Council, then called speaker.

The Legislative Council was expanded in 1853 to 18 nominees and 36 elected members. A further expansion of the Council occurred in 1855, when 8 new members were elected from five new electorates, with one new nominee.
The first Legislative Council existed for five years and was responsible for at least three significant and enduring contributions to the parliamentary system of Victoria:
*it drafted the &quot;Constitution of Victoria&quot;, which provides the framework for the system of government in Victoria;
*it introduced the secret ballot. The Victorian Electoral Act 1856 introduced secret ballots on 19 March 1856, an innovation at the time but now common around the world; and
*it ordered the construction of the Victorian Parliament House in Melbourne.

The new constitution was approved by the Legislative Council in March 1854 and was sent to Britain where it was passed by the United Kingdom Parliament as the &quot;Victoria Constitution Act 1855&quot;, received Royal Assent on 16 July 1855 and was proclaimed in Victoria on 23 November 1855. The Constitution established a Westminster-style system of responsible government that continues in Victoria today.

===Second Legislative Council ===

The new Constitution came into effect in 1856. It created a bicameral Parliament of Victoria, with the Legislative Assembly being the lower house and the Council being the upper house. The Council consisted of 30 members, with five members being elected from each of the six provinces. The Parliament of Victoria first met on 21 November 1856 at the almost completed main sections of Parliament House. James Frederick Palmer was elected first President of the Council.

The Legislative Council was later elected from a varying number of provinces. In 1882, several new provinces were created while Central and Eastern were abolished. In 1904, more provinces were created and two members (MLCs) represented each province. The terms for members were two Assembly terms, and one member was elected in rotation at each election, by majority-preferential (AV) vote. Until 1950, the Legislative Council was elected on a restricted property-based franchise and always had a conservative majority.

Until 1958, elections for the Legislative Council were not held in conjunction with those for the Legislative Assembly, but starting at the 1961 election they have been held at the same time. Prior to the 2006 election, the Legislative Council consisted of 44 members elected for two terms of the Legislative Assembly from 22 two-member provinces. Half the members were elected at each election on a rotation basis. This old system tended to favour the Liberal Party and the National Party (often in Coalition) over the Labor Party and other parties; as the Liberal party&#x27;s support was more evenly spread across the state, compared to Labor&#x27;s wasted votes in already safe provinces. This resulted in many instances of a Labor government being faced with an opposition-controlled Council – a rare occurrence elsewhere in Australia.

===2003 reforms===
The electoral system used to elect members of the Legislative Council changed for the 2006 Victorian election, as a result of major reforms passed by the Labor government, led by Steve Bracks, in 2003. Under the new system the State is divided into eight electoral regions, each of which returns five members. These Legislative Council members serve terms linked to the Legislative Assembly, which has fixed four-year terms unless earlier dissolved in exceptional circumstances.

Each electoral region covers 11 contiguous Legislative Assembly electoral districts and has 420,000 electors.

Five regions are metropolitan (Melbourne and environs) (Eastern Metropolitan, Northern Metropolitan, South Eastern Metropolitan, Southern Metropolitan, and Western Metropolitan) and three are non-urban regions (Eastern Victoria, Northern Victoria and Western Victoria).

Since 2006, Legislative Council members have been elected using the single transferable vote system of proportional representation. Each region elects five members. The quota for a seat in each region is 16.7% (one-sixth), approximately 70,000.

Small parties never receive this amount on the First Count in Victoria&#x27;s Legislative Council elections but through the vote transfers that are part of STV, some candidates of small parties do receive vote transfers from other small-party candidates and pass quota that way. STV thus results in an increase in the number of minor parties represented in the Legislative Council as compared to the Instant-runoff voting system. Under Instant-runoff voting, in 2002 for example, the traditional big three - Labor, Liberal and National - took all the seats - Greens with 314,000 voters overall did not take one seat. In 2006 the Greens took almost exactly the same number of votes that it had in 2002 and this time won three seats, just slightly less than its 10 percent of the vote should have given it proportionally. The Democratic Labour Party also won a seat, the first one it had won in 50 years. STV was such that the success for those two parties was achieved while at the same time Labor, Liberal and National parties each still took a number of seats.

At the same time, the Council&#x27;s ability to block supply was removed.

== Composition ==

Since the 2006 Victorian state election, the Legislative Council has had 40 members serving four-year terms, elected from eight electoral regions, each returning five members.

Prior to the 2006 election, the Legislative Council consisted of 44 members elected for two terms of the Legislative Assembly from 22 two-member provinces. Half the members were elected at each election on a rotation basis. The number of members was increased to 44 from 36 in 1976 and from 34 in 1967.

Property qualifications for voting in the Legislative Council were abolished for the 1952 Legislative Council election, increasing the number of eligible voters from 0.5 million in 1949 to 1.4 million in 1952, and resulting in a large increase in the number of Labor MLCs. However, Labor achieved a majority in the Council only at the 1985 and the 2002 elections.

<text>The Rolls-Royce RB.80 Conway was the first turbofan jet engine to enter service. Development started at Rolls-Royce in the 1940s, but the design was used only briefly, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before other turbofan designs replaced it. The Conway engine was used on versions of the Handley Page Victor, Vickers VC10, Boeing 707-420 and Douglas DC-8-40.

The name &quot;Conway&quot; is the English spelling of the River Conwy, in Wales, in keeping with Rolls&#x27; use of river names for gas turbine engines.

==Development==

===Background===
Alan Arnold Griffith had proposed a number of different bypass or turbofan engine designs as early as the 1930s while he and Hayne Constant were trying to get their axial-flow jet engines working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. However, simpler turbojet designs were prioritized during World War II for their use in military applications. Priorities changed dramatically at the end of the war and in 1946 Rolls-Royce agreed that existing engines like the Rolls-Royce Avon were advanced enough to enable a start to work on more advanced concepts like bypass.

Griffith, who by then had become Chief Engineer at Rolls-Royce, suggested building a purely experimental bypass design using parts of the Avon and another experimental jet engine, the AJ.25 Tweed. In April 1947, a design was proposed, but over the next few months it was modified to evolve into a larger design in response to a need for a new engine to power the Mk.2 low-level version of the Vickers Valiant bomber. The go-ahead to start construction of this larger design was given in October, under the name RB.80.

===Early models===

During development it was decided to further improve the basic design by adding another feature then becoming common, a &quot;two spool&quot; compressor arrangement. Earlier engines generally consisted of a series of compressor stages connected via a shaft to one or more turbine stages, with the burners between them arranged around the shaft. Although this arrangement is mechanically simple, it has the disadvantage of lowering the efficiency of the compressor. Compressor stages run at their maximum efficiency when spinning at a specific speed for any given input air pressure - in a perfect compressor each stage would run at a separate speed. The multi-spool design, first used on the Bristol Olympus turbojet, is a compromise, the compressor being separated into &quot;spools&quot; designed to operate closer to most efficient speed, driven by separate turbines via concentric shafts. Two- and three-spool designs are common; beyond that the mechanical complexity is too great.

The new version had a four-stage low-pressure compressor driven by a two-stage turbine and an eight stage high-pressure compressor driven by another two-stage turbine. Now known by the Ministry of Supply designation as the RCo.2, design work was completed in January 1950 and the first example ran for the first time in July 1952 at thrust. By this time, the low-level Valiant Pathfinder had been abandoned and so the first example was also destined to be the last. Nevertheless, it proved the basic concept sound and &quot;ran perfectly for the whole of its 133 hours life.&quot;

The work on the RCo.2 was soon put to good use. In October 1952, the Royal Air Force awarded a contract for the Vickers V-1000, a large jet-powered strategic transport that was intended to allow the V bomber force to be supported in the field through air supply only. Vickers also planned on developing a passenger version of the same basic design as the VC-7. The V-1000 design looked like an enlarged de Havilland Comet but from the Valiant it took the wing layout and added a compound sweep (a passing vogue in UK design). It also featured the Comet&#x27;s wing-embedded engines, demanding an engine with a small cross-section, which limited the amount of bypass the engine could use. It nevertheless required higher power to support a gross weight, so Rolls responded with the larger RCo.5.

The new engine was similar to the RCo.2 in most ways, differing in details. The low-pressure compressor now had six stages and the high-pressure nine, driven by two and one stage turbines respectively. The first RCo.5 ran in July 1953 and passed an official type rating in August 1955 at . Construction of the prototype V-1000 was well underway at Vickers Armstrong&#x27;s Wisley works in the summer of 1955 when the entire project was cancelled. Having second thoughts about the concept of basing the V-bombers away from the UK, the need for the V-1000 became questionable and it became an easy decision to drop the project.

===Production versions===

The Conway was saved once again when it was selected to power the Handley Page Victor B.2 variant, replacing the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire used by earlier models. For this role, Rolls-Royce designed an even larger model, the RCo.8 of , which ran for the first time in January 1956. However the RCo.8 was skipped over after receiving a request from Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA) to explore a Conway-powered Boeing 707 or Douglas DC-8, having interested both companies in the idea. Rolls-Royce responded by designing an even larger model of the Conway, the RCo.10 and offering the similar military-rated RCo.11 for the Victor. The new engine differed from the RCo.8 in having a new &quot;zeroth stage&quot; at the front of the low-pressure compressor, further increasing cold airflow around the engine. The RCo.10 first flew in the modified prototype Avro Vulcan &quot;VX770&quot; on 9 August 1957 only for the aircraft to be lost in a crash the following year. The RCo.11 was flown in the Victor on 20 February 1959.

Boeing calculated that the Conway with a bypass of only 30% would increase the proposed 707-420&#x27;s range by 8% above the otherwise identical 707-320 powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A (J75) turbojets. That estimate proved optimistic; the actual range improvement was a maximum of 2%. In May 1956, TCA ordered Conway-powered DC-8-40s, followed by additional orders from Alitalia and Canadian Pacific Air Lines, while the Conway-powered 707-420 was ordered by BOAC, Lufthansa, Varig, El Al and Air India. RCo.10&#x27;s development was so smooth that after delivering a small number for testing, production deliveries switched to the RCo.12, which was designed, built and tested before the airframes finished testing. Boeing&#x27;s 707-420 featured a distinctive, scalloped exhaust nozzle (pictured above) incorporating noise suppression and mechanical and aerodynamic thrust reversal up to 50%, which was developed and supplied by Rolls-Royce. Douglas developed the DC-8&#x27;s reverser-suppressor nozzle to work in conjunction with a variable ejector, which provided necessary, additional noise suppression.

Although successful in this role, only 37 707s and 32 DC-8s were fitted with the Conway, due largely to delivery of the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D: this was the first US-built bypass engine and had a considerably higher bypass ratio than the Conway. Nevertheless, the Conway was successful on those aircraft, and was the first commercial aero engine to be awarded an operational period of up to 10,000 hours between major overhauls. Due to the Conway, B707-420 take-offs were the loudest by jetliners on airports and over communities until [[Concorde] entered service. However, the Conway was revolutionary, being the first turbofan, and the first commercial engine, equipped with internally air-cooled turbine blades, which partially accounted for its high efficiency and an extremely high exhaust temperature of .

===Final versions===

Final development of the Conway first involved the RCo.42, designed specifically for the [[Vickers VC10]]. As the need for wing-embedded engines was long abandoned by this point, Rolls-Royce dramatically increased the zero-stage diameter to increase the bypass from about 30% to 60%. Other major revisions were incorporated, primarily in the low-pressure compressor. First run was in March 1961. Takeoff rating was . For the Super VC10, the last model was the RCo.43, rated at .

==Design==

The RCo.12 Conway was an axial-flow turbofan with a low bypass of about 30% or bypass ratio of 0.3:1. It had a seven-stage low-pressure compressor, the first six stages made of aluminium and the last of titanium. Behind this was the nine-stage high-pressure compressor, the first seven stages of titanium and the last two of steel. The bypass housing duct was also made of titanium. The bypass duct started after the seventh stage. The combustion area consisted of ten cannular [[flame can]]s. The high-pressure compressor was driven by a single-stage turbine using hollow air-cooled blades, which was followed by the two-stage turbine powering the low-pressure compressor. Accessories were arranged around the front of the engine to minimise overall diameter.

The RCo.12 produced for takeoff, weighed dry and had a [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] of 0.725 at takeoff and 0.874 for typical cruise.

In 1968, Hyfil [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon-fibre]] fan blades were installed on Conways of VC10s operated by [[BOAC]].

===Patent dispute===
In November, 1966, the inlet to the Conway engine, together with those for commercial Avon and Spey installations, was the subject of a patent infringement claim against Rolls-Royce by Rateau, a French manufacturer of steam turbines and automobile [[superchargers]]. [[:fr:Auguste Rateau|Société pour l’exploitation des appareils Rateau]] of [[La Courneuve]], who alleged the inlets infringed two of their [[Term of patent|expired]] 1939 patents. The patent stated that the intake, by its diffusing internal shape, determines the speed of the air entering the engine compressor. Since the Conway in the Boeing 707, and the other Rolls-Royce engines, had diffusing intakes, Rateau expected to be compensated for every engine made, as well as stopping all future production. Although Rateau&#x27;s claim was only against Rolls-Royce, its understanding of the purpose of an intake applied to any jet engine installation. Witnesses for Rolls-Royce, including Frank Whittle, convinced the judge that an intake did not produce the effect claimed and that the claim was &quot;speculative&quot; because, by 1939, no axial-flow aircraft jet engine had been built and that earlier patents from Frank Whittle and others had already considered the design of the intakes.

A history of the band written by George Bunnell states that &quot;The Strawberry Alarm Clock came about by parts of two bands, Thee Sixpence and Waterfyrd Traene, morphing into one.&quot; The group, originally named Thee Sixpence, initially consisted of Ed King (lead guitar, vocals), Michael Luciano (vocals), Lee Freeman (rhythm guitar, harmonica, vocals), Gary Lovetro (bass), Steve Rabe (guitar, vocals), and Gene Gunnels (drums). Randy Seol (drums, vibes, percussion, vocals) and Mark Weitz (keyboards, vocals) joined to replace the departing Gunnels, Rabe, and Luciano just as the name change to Strawberry Alarm Clock was occurring. Seol eventually brought in songwriters Bunnell and Steve Bartek, who participated in the writing and recording of Strawberry Alarm Clock&#x27;s first album.

The inception of Strawberry Alarm Clock, aside from Thee Sixpence, is not well documented, largely because none of the latter band&#x27;s recordings (subsequently lost) were released. However, according to Bunnell, many Strawberry Alarm Clock songs came from the band he had formed previously with Seol, Bartek, Randy Zacuto, Fred Schwartz, and Criss Jay, which performed under the names Waterfyrd Traene (pre-Strawberry Alarm Clock), Public Bubble (during Strawberry Alarm Clock), and Buffington Rhodes (post-Strawberry Alarm Clock). There were two recording sessions with some of these personnel: one with Dave Hassinger at the Recording Factory and one with Bill Lazarus at Sunset Sound. There were probably ten songs in all that were recorded, but Bunnell stated that both masters were stolen. The post-Strawberry Alarm Clock incarnation broke up before any success was realized.

The first and most famous single by Strawberry Alarm Clock was &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;, produced by Frank Slay. The song was initially released as a B-side by Thee Sixpence on All American Records, which was owned by Bill Holmes, the band&#x27;s manager and producer. The band was not impressed by songwriter John Carter&#x27;s vocals, so Slay chose Greg Munford, a 16-year-old friend of the band from another group called Shapes of Sound, to sing lead on the track. The Uni Records subsidiary of MCA picked up the record for national distribution, and the single was re-released in May 1967 with &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot; as the A-side. The song reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during the week ending November 25, 1967. The band made a cameo appearance performing the song in the Richard Rush film &quot;Psych-Out&quot;.

Weitz and King (also a member of Hunger) were denied songwriting credits by Slay, who stated that they did not write the melody line or lyrics, even though the song was built on an instrumental by Weitz with a bridge by King. This instrumental was originally intended as a B-side to &quot;The Birdman of Alkatrash&quot;, which ultimately became the B-side to &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;. The single spent one week at No. 1 and remained on the charts for a total of 16 weeks. A gold disc was awarded for sales of one million copies by the Recording Industry Association of America on December 19, 1967.

Shortly after recording &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;, the band added Bunnell (on bass, rhythm guitar, and vocals) before making their first album. Also titled &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;, it reached No. 11 on the US album chart in late 1967. Bunnell would also become their main songwriter. Some early Strawberry Alarm Clock songs were written by Bunnell with Bartek. The latter played flute on the first two Strawberry Alarm Clock albums and would remain involved with the band&#x27;s later lineups. Bartek later joined The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo and orchestrated Boingo frontman Danny Elfman&#x27;s film scores.

In November 1967, and again in April 1968, Strawberry Alarm Clock toured on a bill with the Beach Boys and Buffalo Springfield. During the April leg of the tour, several dates in the South were canceled following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4, 1968. Ed King said that the band all acquired handguns after King&#x27;s death for the remaining shows in the South, and that he carried his in his waistband onstage.

In their early days of touring, the band members would often sit on &quot;magic carpets&quot; as their roadies carried them to the stage. Drummer Seol would rig up wrist gas jets to give the illusion that he was playing the bongos and vibes with his hands on fire, until the gimmick became too dangerous.

===1968–1969: Lineup changes===

During Strawberry Alarm Clock&#x27;s short lifespan, the band underwent numerous lineup changes. As Bunnell became the primary songwriter, he began playing more of the bass parts, as he was already familiar with the songs. Original bassist Lovetro gradually transitioned into the role of road manager, but was eventually bought out of the group after conflicts with the others before the release of the second album, &quot;Wake Up...It&#x27;s Tomorrow&quot;. The album’s single, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, was a minor hit and their only other Top 40 appearance, reaching No. 23 in early 1968. The second album also benefited from vocal coach Howard Davis, who was brought in to help the members elevate the harmony singing featured on &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot; to new levels of sophistication.

Later 1968 singles included &quot;Sit with the Guru&quot; (charting at No. 65) and &quot;Barefoot in Baltimore&quot; (which peaked at No. 67 and was later included on their &quot;The World in a Sea Shell&quot; album). The latter song was especially popular in its namesake city of Baltimore, Maryland, in the counterculture neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere. The tune received considerable airplay on local Baltimore radio stations and was even occasionally used as a theme song for the city&#x27;s image in later decades.

Bunnell and Seol left the band in late 1968 at the end of the sessions for &quot;The World in a Sea Shell&quot; due to disagreements over their manager Bill Holmes&#x27; mishandling of the band&#x27;s business affairs. Bunnell, Seol, and Bartek then formed a new band, Buffington Rhodes. Holmes was fired by the remaining members, but he retaliated by creating an alternate version of Strawberry Alarm Clock (featuring Bunnell and Seol) and sending them on tour. The band responded with an injunction against Holmes, and the Los Angeles County Superior Court subsequently barred him from using the band&#x27;s name to start a rival group.

Drummer Marty Katon then joined, along with new lead singer/guitarist Jimmy Pitman (formerly of the Nightcrawlers), and the band shifted to a more blues rock style. King moved to bass, as he had been playing many of the bass parts in the studio. In early 1969, original &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot; drummer Gunnels rejoined Strawberry Alarm Clock, replacing Katon. Pitman left in July 1969 after the &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot; album failed to sell. He was succeeded by Paul Marshall, who would stay with the group until they disbanded temporarily in 1971. The title track, &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot;, peaked at No. 87 in 1969 but was eclipsed by Oliver&#x27;s more successful version. Weitz quit in December 1969, and the group continued as a quartet with King, Freeman, Gunnels, and Marshall.

===1970–1981: Breakup and brief reunion===
In 1970, the band appeared in the Russ Meyer cult classic film &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;. By this time, their popularity had waned considerably, but they continued touring the South in 1970 and 1971, with an unknown Florida band called Lynyrd Skynyrd opening for them. In late 1971, with no record label and internal conflicts over musical direction, the group decided to disband. Lead guitarist King chose to relocate to the South, while Gunnels joined the backup band for the Everly Brothers, along with Waddy Wachtel and Warren Zevon. During the tour with Lynyrd Skynyrd, King had expressed interest in joining the band to vocalist Ronnie Van Zant, and he accepted an invitation to join in November 1972. King would later compose the classic opening riff to the band&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, released in 1974.

Strawberry Alarm Clock briefly reunited in 1974–1975 with Bunnell, Seol, and Bartek. The trio performed a few shows and contributed the theme song to the late-night 1970s televised rock concert series &quot;ABC in Concert&quot;. They also appeared on one of the smaller stages at the first California Jam on April 6, 1974.

===1982–2001: Reunion and alternate lineup===
Strawberry Alarm Clock reunited once again in 1982 after guitarist Freeman spotted a newspaper ad promoting an appearance by the group at a Los Angeles club, The Music Machine. Freeman knew nothing about this gig and went to the club to investigate. There he discovered that the advertisement had actually been a plot by the club&#x27;s owners to get the real band to reunite. At this point, Freeman, Bunnell, Weitz, and Gunnells reformed as Strawberry Alarm Clock. They were joined in 1983 by singer Leo Gaffney and Freeman&#x27;s brother, Doug.

By 1983, the Strawberry Alarm Clock lineup was Freeman, Bunnell, Peter Wasner (keyboards), and James Harrah (guitar). &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot; was re-recorded the same year with a lineup of Freeman, Bunnell, Harrah, Bartek, and Clay Bernard (keyboards), with Bob Caloca on lead vocals. The remake was produced by Dennis Dragon (brother of Daryl Dragon), who also played percussion on the track.

Freeman, Bunnell, Harrah, and Bernard continued on, with Seol rejoining. Seol left again in 1984, and Harrah and Bernard were replaced by actor/musician Jon Walmsley (guitar, keyboards, vocals). Bruce Hubbard, who had earlier played with Bunnell in Buffington Roads, took over percussion duties. Walmsley was out by 1986, replaced by guitarist Howie Anderson along with a returning Bernard. Anderson also handled keyboard parts via his synth guitar after Bernard left once again, this time to relocate to New Mexico at the end of the 1980s.

The band began performing on oldies concert tours during the 1980s, often alongside other late-1960s acts such as Moby Grape, the Seeds, and It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day. The Freeman/Bunnell/Hubbard/Anderson lineup became their longest-lasting, continuing from 1989 to 2001. During this period, members worked on new material, made occasional concert appearances, and pursued other individual careers.

Meanwhile, in 1982, late-1960s Strawberry Alarm Clock member Pitman was performing with a band called Thunderchicken in Salt Lake City, Utah, and decided to form his own version of Strawberry Alarm Clock. He teamed up with Preston Kofoed (bass), Mordecai Noble (guitar), Dave Stone (keyboards), and Dave &quot;Plumb&quot; Derrick (drums). This version of the group played a benefit for the Veterans of the Vietnam War at New Faces Roadhouse and toured extensively throughout the western US before disbanding a few years later in Jackson, Wyoming.

===2001–present: New album===
On June 16, 2001, the group performed at a concert at San Diego&#x27;s Balboa Park, sharing the stage with Moby Grape, Jefferson Starship, Iron Butterfly, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Country Joe McDonald. Seol and Gunnels joined Freeman, Bunnell, Anderson, and Hubbard for this show.

On October 23, 2003, the same lineup was joined by Bartek and Marshall for an appearance at Amoeba Records in Hollywood to celebrate the DVD release of &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;.

In December 2004, Weitz and King were slated to reunite with Seol, Freeman, and Bunnell, along with original &quot;Incense&quot; singer Munford, for a PBS special on 1960s-era rock music; however, the band did not appear. Bunnell later stated in interviews that PBS never sent the proper contracts to the band.

By 2006, Weitz, Bartek, Bunnell, Seol, and Anderson were back performing shows with the group. King, Freeman, Marshall, and Gunnels joined them for a performance at the Virginia Theatre in Champaign, Illinois, on April 29, 2007. This event was part of the last day of Roger Ebert&#x27;s ninth annual Roger Ebert&#x27;s Overlooked Film Festival, and it was preceded by a screening of &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; (co-written by Ebert and director Russ Meyer). Freeman, Weitz, Bartek, Bunnell, Seol, Gunnels, and Anderson continued to make concert appearances throughout 2007.

By 2008, an ailing Freeman was sidelined, and in 2010, Bartek began to reduce his appearances with the group.

In January 2010, Strawberry Alarm Clock started recording new material for a record label created by Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins. Strawberry Alarm Clock keyboardist Weitz (who played keyboards in 2009 for Corgan&#x27;s side project Spirits in the Sky) stated, &quot;We’re picking up where we left off, but with a modern sound.&quot; The band also reworked some of its 1960s songs.

Founding member Lee Freeman (born November 8, 1949) died on February 14, 2010, at the age of 60, from complications arising from cancer.

Carrying on as Strawberry Alarm Clock were Weitz, Seol, Bunnell, Gunnels, and Anderson, with Bartek appearing as his schedule permitted. Strawberry Alarm Clock performed live during 2012 around Southern California, including appearances at The Satellite in Los Feliz, the Whisky a Go Go, the Echoplex (for the West Psych Fest), and the Adams Avenue Street Fair in San Diego.

On October 21, 2012, Strawberry Alarm Clock performed at the 29th annual Love Ride benefit in Glendale, which featured grand marshals Jay Leno, Peter Fonda, and Robert Patrick. Immediately following their Love Ride appearance, the band was awarded proclamations from the City of Los Angeles by City Councilman Tom LaBonge, Eric Garcetti, and Leno to commemorate the 45th anniversary of &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot; reaching No. 1. The band accepted plaques for Freeman (posthumously) and King (who, by this time, was happily retired in Nashville, Tennessee). Bartek was present for their performance, as was the Neville Brothers&#x27; longtime harmonica player, Robert Cowan.

On April 1, 2012, Strawberry Alarm Clock released &quot;Wake Up Where You Are&quot; on the Global Recording Artists label. It was the band&#x27;s fifth studio album and first since 1969.

Roger Ebert died on April 4, 2013, and on July 27, his widow, Chaz Ebert, requested that Strawberry Alarm Clock perform at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills as part of a tribute to her late husband. Strawberry Alarm Clock played a half-dozen songs, followed by a screening of &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;. Charles Dierkop, a veteran character actor and longtime friend of the band, introduced them. In the months following the Saban Theatre engagement, Strawberry Alarm Clock made plans to write and record new material for an EP.

On August 19, 2016, Weitz was hospitalized after a car accident; veteran keyboardist Glenn Brigman filled in while Weitz recovered.

On March 18, 2017, Strawberry Alarm Clock performed at the Starry Nights Festival in Santa Barbara with Weitz back on stage with the band once again.

Jimmy Pitman (born September 28, 1946) died in hospice care on August 29, 2019, at the age of 72.

===Timeline===

==Television and films==
Strawberry Alarm Clock made several television appearances, including &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Happening &#x27;68&quot;, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, and the first episode of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. Drummer Seol appeared as one of three eligible bachelors on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and was chosen by the girl.

The band also made two notable appearances in films. In the 1968 Jack Nicholson movie &quot;Psych-Out&quot;, they performed several songs, including &quot;Incense and Peppermints,&quot; &quot;Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow,&quot; and &quot;The World&#x27;s on Fire.&quot; &quot;The Pretty Song from Psych-Out&quot; was re-recorded by a San Fernando Valley garage band, the Storybook, for the film&#x27;s soundtrack album, but the Strawberry Alarm Clock&#x27;s version was featured in the film.

The band&#x27;s second movie appearance was in 1970&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;, where they played &quot;Incense and Peppermints,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Comin&#x27; Home,&quot; and &quot;Girl from the City.&quot; The soundtrack release included the latter two songs, which were not on any previous albums and were recorded with Marshall on vocals.

<text>The Western Australian Legislative Assembly, or lower house, is one of the two chambers of the Parliament of Western Australia, an Australian state. The Parliament sits in Parliament House in the Western Australian capital, Perth.

The Legislative Assembly today has 59 members, elected for four-year terms from single-member electoral districts. Members are elected using the preferential voting system. As with all other Australian states and territories, voting is compulsory for all Australian citizens over the legal voting age of 18.

==Role and operation==
Most legislation in Western Australia is initiated in the Legislative Assembly. The party or coalition that can command a majority in the Legislative Assembly is invited by the Governor to form a government. That party or coalition&#x27;s leader, once sworn in, subsequently becomes the Premier of Western Australia, and a team of the leader&#x27;s, party&#x27;s or coalition&#x27;s choosing (whether they be in the Legislative Assembly or in the Legislative Council) can then be sworn in as ministers responsible for various portfolios. As Australian political parties traditionally vote along party lines, most legislation introduced by the governing party will pass through the House of Assembly.

==History==

The Legislative Assembly was the first elected legislature in Western Australia, having been created in 1890, when Western Australia gained self-government. It initially consisted of 30 members, all of whom were elected, although only male landowners could vote. This replaced a system where the Governor was responsible for most legislative matters, with only the appointed Legislative Council to guide him.

Suffrage was extended to all adult males in 1893, although Indigenous Australians were specifically excluded. Women gained the right to vote in 1899, making Western Australia the second of the Australian colonies (behind South Australia) to do so. In 1921, Edith Cowan became the first woman to be elected to parliament anywhere in Australia when she won the Legislative Assembly seat of West Perth for the Nationalist Party.

==Electoral distribution and reform==
For many years, Western Australia used a zonal electoral system for both houses of parliament. In most Australian jurisdictions, each state electorate represents an approximately equal number of voters. However, in Western Australia, until 2008 an MP represented 28,519 voters in greater Perth (the Metropolitan Region Scheme area) or 14,551 country voters. At the 2006 census taken on 8 August 2006, 73.76% of Western Australia&#x27;s residents lived in and around Perth, but only 34 of Western Australia&#x27;s 57 Legislative Assembly seats, representing 60% of the total, were located in the metropolitan region. There has been strong support over time in some quarters for the principle of one vote, one value, particularly from the Labor Party who were at particular disadvantage under the system. Up until 2005, reform had proceeded gradually—the most dramatic changes had occurred with the enactment of the &quot;Electoral Districts Act 1947&quot; and the &quot;Acts Amendment (Electoral Reform) Act 1987&quot;, the latter of which raised the number of metropolitan seats from 29 to 34.

Effective on 20 May 2005, the &quot;Electoral Amendment and Repeal Act 2005&quot; (No.1 of 2005) abolished the country-metropolitan distinction for the Legislative Assembly, but all seats then in place remained until the following election on 6 September 2008. A redistribution of seats announced by the Western Australian Electoral Commission on 29 October 2007 places 42 seats in Perth and 17 in the country, with a variation of ±10% from the average population normally permitted. The only distinction for rural seats is that any seat with an area of or greater (that is, 4% of the State&#x27;s land area) may have a variation of +10%–20% from the average, using an adjusted population based on the seat&#x27;s area in square kilometres.

==Current distribution of Assembly seats==

30 votes as a majority are required to pass legislation.

<text>The Legislative Council, or upper house, is one of the two chambers of the Parliament of South Australia. Its central purpose is to act as a house of review for legislation passed through the lower house, the House of Assembly. It sits in Parliament House in the state capital, Adelaide.

The upper house has 22 members elected for staggered eight-year terms by proportional representation, with half of the members facing re-election every four years. It is elected in a similar manner to its federal counterpart, the Australian Senate. Casual vacancies—where a member resigns or dies—are filled by a joint sitting of both houses, who then elect a replacement.

==History==
===Advisory council===

At the founding of the Province of South Australia under the &quot;South Australia Act 1834&quot;, governance of the new colony was divided between the Governor of South Australia and a Resident Commissioner, who reported to a new body known as the &quot;South Australian Colonization Commission&quot;. Under this arrangement, there was also a governing Council comprising the Governor, the Judge or Chief Justice, the Colonial Secretary, the Advocate-General and the Resident Commissioner, with broad legislative and executive powers including the imposition of rates, duties, and taxes. This council was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Legislative Council&quot;. Confusion and dispute about the division of power between the two roles led to the &quot;South Australia Government Act 1838&quot;, which combined the role of Resident Commissioner with that of the Governor.

In 1842, the &quot;South Australia Act 1842&quot; was passed in order to replace the South Australian Colonisation Commission appointed in 1834 with a more standard British model of government, with a Governor advised by a Legislative Council. The 1842 Act gave the British Government, which was responsible for appointing a Governor and at least seven other officers to the Legislative Council, full control of South Australia as a Crown Colony, after financial mismanagement by the first administration had nearly bankrupted the colony. This new Legislative Council was the first true parliamentary body in South Australia. The Act also made provision for a commission to initiate the establishment of democratic government, electoral districts, requirements for voting rights, and terms of office. Although the old governing Council advising the Governor met at Government House, this new Legislative Council met at a new purpose built chamber on North Terrace. This chamber eventually grew into what is now known as &quot;Old Parliament House&quot;.

The council was originally appointed by the Governor (then Sir George Grey), and only served in an advisory capacity, as the Governor retained almost all legislative powers. It was expanded slightly in 1843, when several prominent landowners were allowed to join. In the same year, proceedings were opened to the general public.

Public demand for some form of representative government had been growing throughout the 1840s, and this was reflected in a series of reforms in 1851, which created a partially representative Legislative Council. After the changes, it consisted of 24 members, four official (filling what would be today ministerial positions) and four non-official members, both nominated by the governor on behalf of the Crown, and 16 elected members. The right to vote for these positions was not universal, however, being limited to propertied men. In addition, the reforms meant that the Governor no longer oversaw proceedings, with the role being filled by a Speaker who had been elected by the members.

===Self-government===
In 1856, the Legislative Council passed the &quot;Constitution Act 1856&quot; (SA), which prepared what was to become the 1857 Constitution of South Australia. This laid out the means for true self-government, and created a bicameral system, which involved delegating most of its legislative powers to the new House of Assembly. While all adult males could vote in the new Assembly, the Council continued to limit voting rights to the wealthier classes; suffrage was male-only and dependent on certain property and wage requirements. The entire province was a single electorate for the Legislative Council, electing 18 members, with the scheme originally set up so that 6 members would be elected every 4 years to serve a 12 year term.

The council had its purpose in replicating the British House of Lords as a restricted &quot;house of review&quot; in a colonial context. When the Province of South Australia received its original constitution in 1857, it was the most democratic in the British Empire, combining a universal-suffrage lower house (the House of Assembly), with a restricted-suffrage upper house (the Legislative Council). The purpose of the Legislative Council was, as with the 19th century House of Lords, to safeguard the &quot;longer term interests of the nation rather than just reacting to short term ephemeral issues of the day&quot;.

In 1882, the Legislative Council was increased to 24 members by the a special election brought on by the &quot;Constitution Act Further Amendment Act 1881&quot;, and the Province was then divided into four districts which each elected six members: Central, North-Eastern, Northern and Southern districts. At the same time, the electoral schedule was shifted so that half of the Council was elected at each House of Assembly election.

Women earned the right to vote in the Council at the same time as the Assembly, in 1895, the first Parliament in Australia to do so, under the radical Premier Charles Kingston.

===Federation===
In 1902, following the Federation of Australia, the &quot;Constitution Act Amendment Act 1901&quot; reduced the size of the legislative council from 24 back to 18 members - 6 from Central District and four each from Northern, North-Eastern and Southern districts. North-Eastern District was replaced by Midland District from the 1910 election, and the restricted franchise was extended to include ministers of religion, school head teachers, postmasters, railway stationmasters, and the officer in charge of a police station.

In 1913 the franchise extended to the inhabitant occupier of a house (but not their spouse) and the council expanded to 20 people, four from each of five districts, with the Central district being replaced by Central District No. 1 and Central District No. 2. &quot;Contingency voting&quot;, a form of preferential voting, was introduced from 1930.

===Composition of Council over time===
The council&#x27;s numbers varied over time. From inception to 1882, it had 18 members elected by a single colony-wide district. From then until 1902 it had 24 members; until 1915, 18 members; and until 1975, 20 members. The electoral districts were drawn with a heavy bias in favour of rural areas in place, with half of the council being elected each time. From 1915 to 1975, Labor did not gain more than two members at each election, with the conservative parties always holding a sizeable majority. From 1975, the council was increased to 22 members, with half (11) to be elected at each election.

The conservative members in the council were very independent, and differed markedly from their counterparts in the House of Assembly. During the long reign of Liberal and Country League (LCL) Premier Sir Thomas Playford, they would prove to be an irritant, and Labor support was sometimes required for bills to pass. When a Labor government was eventually elected in 1965 and began introducing social legislation that was anathema to LCL councillors, they would delay, obstruct and modify such bills. The councillors, however, saw their actions (in the words of MLC Sir Arthur Rymill) necessary to &quot;oppose... radical moves that I feel would not be in the permanent will of the people.&quot; The House of Assembly contained some progressive Liberals, and its membership would usually abide by the party line. The council contained none, and its members rebelled regularly against the decisions of the party leadership and the popular will of the people.

===Universal suffrage===
Even after electoral legislation had been implemented in 1967 by Steele Hall that produced a fairer electoral system for the House of Assembly, the council remained a house of property.

Under the original 1856 Constitution, the franchise was restricted to men, &quot;having a freehold estate in possession, either legal or equitable, situate within the said Province, of the clear value of Fifty Pounds sterling money above all charges and encumbrances affecting the same, or having a leasehold estate in possession, situate within the said Province, the lease thereof having been registered in the General Registry Office, for the registration of deeds, and having three years to run at the time of voting, or containing a clause authorising the lessee to become the purchaser of the land thereby demised, or occupy a dwelling house of the clear annual value of Twenty-five Pounds sterling money.&quot;

In 1907, the right to vote was extended to any person occupying a dwelling house, or &quot;dwelling house and premises appurtenant thereto&quot;, with an annual rent of at least 17 pounds per annum (excluding any payment of rent by a wife to her husband); to a registered proprietor of a leasehold on which there were improvements to the value of at least 50 pounds and which were the property of the proprietor. At the same time, the franchise was also extended to ministers of religion, school head teachers, postmasters, railway stationmasters, and the officer in charge of a police station.

A further extension of the franchise came in 1913, when the qualification of an occupier of a dwelling house was altered to include any inhabitant occupier, whether owner or tenant.

In 1918, the right to vote for members of the upper house was extended to all those who had served in armed forced in the First World War. This was subsequently extended to Second World War veterans in 1940 and in 1969, it was simplified to apply to all Australian war veterans regardless of the war they served in.

In 1969, the franchise was granted to any person who owned or rented property, regardless of the value of the property. Further, the franchise was extended to the wedded spouse of the owner or renter.

Major changes came in 1973 under Don Dunstan. Dunstan, a social reformist, tired of the council&#x27;s obstructionist attitude, and put forward bills for its reform. These changes would remove the council&#x27;s rural bias as well as all restrictions on suffrage (other than the age of majority, though this was lowered from 21 to 18 years). Initially rejected by the council, the reform created a single statewide electorate of 22 members, with 11 being elected each general election. It eventually passed with bipartisan support.

The new council was designed to be deadlocked, and for a party majority to be hard to gain. Its proportional electoral system proved favourable to minor parties and they have usually held the balance of power. The Liberal Movement, in 1975, was the first minor party to have members elected to the council, and its successor, the Australian Democrats, held the balance until 1997 when No Pokies Nick Xenophon was elected. The Family First Party and the Greens gained representation in 2002 and 2006 respectively.
The proportional system used in 1973 was party-list proportional representation, but this was modified in 1985. The federal government of Bob Hawke had introduced a new single transferable vote system for the Australian Senate, enabling voters to choose between voting &#x27;above the line&#x27; (for a single party preference ticket that ranked all candidates on the ballot paper in the party&#x27;s preferred order) or &#x27;below the line&#x27; and number all candidates in order of preference, on the ballot paper. The Bannon state government copied this arrangement for the council.

Following the similar Senate changes which took effect from the 2016 federal election, as of the 2018 state election, South Australia&#x27;s single transferable vote in the proportionally represented upper house was changed from group voting tickets to optional preferential voting − instructions for above the line votes are to mark &#x27;1&#x27; and then further preferences are optional as opposed to preference flows from simply &#x27;1&#x27; above the line being determined by group voting tickets, while instructions for voters who instead opt to vote below the line are to provide at least 12 preferences as opposed to having to number all candidates, and with a savings provision to admit ballot papers which indicate at least 6 below the line preferences.

==Distribution of Seats==

Below is the history of the composition of the Legislative Council since the introduction of Proportional Representation at the 1975 election.

===Current===
(*) In December 2023, Frank Pangallo left the SA-Best party. Jing Lee Resigned from the Liberal Party on 10 January 2025.

At the 2022 election, the eleven seats up for election (the other eleven members had continuing terms) had been held by four Liberal, four Labor, and one each of Greens, Advance SA and an independent. The result elected five Labor, four Liberal, and one each of Greens and One Nation. Consequently the new Labor government would require an additional three non-government votes to pass legislation. However, the Liberal upper house President was unexpectedly re-elected to the Presidency, which would give the Labor government nine of 21 seats during votes on the floor, meaning that only an additional two non-government votes are required to pass legislation.

===2018–2022===
:(*) John Dawkins was expelled from the Liberal Party in 2020 after successfully running against the party&#x27;s nominee for Legislative Council President. This was against the party&#x27;s rules.

At the 2018 election, the 11 of 22 seats up for election were 4 Liberal, 4 Labor, 1 Green, 1 Conservative and 1 Dignity. The final outcome was 4 Liberal, 4 Labor, 2 SA Best and 1 Green. Conservative MLC Dennis Hood, who had been elected as a Family First MLC in 2014, defected to the Liberals nine days after the 2018 state election. John Dawkins was expelled from the Liberal Party in 2020 after successfully running against the party&#x27;s nominee for Legislative Council President. This was against the party&#x27;s rules. The 22 seat upper house composition is therefore 8 Liberal on the government benches, 8 Labor on the opposition benches, and 5 to minor parties and 1 independent on the crossbench, consisting of 2 SA Best, 2 Green, 1 Advance SA and John Dawkins. The government would therefore require at least four additional non-government members to form a majority and carry votes on the floor.

===2014–2018===

1 The two Conservative MPs were elected as members of the Family First Party, which merged into the Australian Conservatives in April 2017.
2 One ex-Independent/Nick Xenophon Team MP was created a new state political party named Advance SA in September 2017.

===2010–2014===

===2006–2010===

:(*) Sandra Kanck was re-elected for a second eight-year term as a Democrat in 2002. In 2009, David Winderlich replaced Kanck due to her resignation. Later in 2009 Winderlich resigned from the Democrats to sit in parliament as an independent.

===2002–2006===

:(*) Terry Cameron had been elected as a Labor member, but had resigned from the party, initially sitting as an independent, and then founding the SA First party in 1999. He did not face re-election in 2002, but the party disbanded soon after the election, and Cameron subsequently returned to being an independent MLC.

===1997–2002===

===1993–1997===

===1989–1993===

===1985–1989===

===1982–1985===

===1979–1982===

===1975–1979===

As part of the transitional arrangements associated with the expansion of the Council from 20 members to 22 members, the Council in this period had 21 members.

<text>The Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory (also known as the Parliament of the Northern Territory) is the unicameral legislature of Australia’s Northern Territory. The Legislative Assembly has 25 members, each elected in single-member electorates for four-year terms. The voting method for the Assembly is the full-preferential voting system, having previously been optional preferential voting. Elections are on the fourth Saturday in August of the fourth year after the previous election, but can be earlier in the event of a no-confidence vote in the government. The most recent election for the Legislative Assembly was the 2024 election held on 24 August. The next election is scheduled for 26 August 2028.

Persons who are qualified under the &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918&quot; to vote for a member for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives are qualified to vote at an election for the Legislative Assembly. Voting is compulsory for all those over 18 years of age. Since 2004, elections have been conducted by the Northern Territory Electoral Commission, which also organises regular electoral redistributions.

Bills passed by the Legislative Assembly become laws once given assent by the Administrator of the Northern Territory, the representative of the Commonwealth Government and the Crown in right of the Northern Territory.

==Current distribution of seats==
, the current distribution of seats is:
* 13 votes as a majority are required to pass legislation.

==Powers==

In 1978, the Northern Territory was granted limited self-government by the &quot;Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1974&quot; (Cth), an act of the federal parliament. The federal government retains control of certain legislative areas, including Aboriginal land, industrial relations, national parks and uranium mining. For inter-governmental financial purposes the Northern Territory has been regarded by the Commonwealth as a State since 1 July 1988.

All questions arising in the Assembly are determined by a majority of votes and the Speaker, or other member presiding, is also entitled to vote. Where there is an equality of votes the Speaker, or other member presiding, shall have a casting vote.

Legislation passed by the Assembly requires assent by the Administrator of the Northern Territory, acting on the advice of the Government, a practice analogous to the royal assent of an Australian state governor. Under Australian constitutional practice, assent is usually a formality. After the Administrator gives assent, the Governor-General of Australia also has the power to reject a law on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia and the federal Cabinet, but this power has also been only rarely exercised. The federal government also retains power to legislate for the Territory in all matters, including the right to override legislation passed by the Assembly.

The party or coalition with the most seats in the Assembly is invited by the Administrator to form government. The leader of that party subsequently becomes the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, and their senior colleagues become ministers responsible for various portfolios. As Australian political parties traditionally vote along party lines, most legislation introduced by the party commanding a majority will pass through the Legislative Assembly.

== Source of legislative power ==
The Legislative Assembly acting with the assent of the administrator is vested with general legislative power, similar to that of the state parliaments. The &quot;Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1974&quot; (Cth) granted self-government to the Territory. The federal government retains control of certain legislative areas, including Aboriginal land, industrial relations, national parks and uranium mining.

However, while the state parliaments derive their legislative powers from constitutional sources, the Northern Territory derives its legislative power from the delegation of powers from the Commonwealth. The Australian Parliament thus retains the right to legislate for the Territory, if it chooses to exercise it. This includes the power to override any legislation passed by the Northern Territory Parliament.

For example, in response to the Northern Territory Parliament&#x27;s passage of the &quot;Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995&quot;, the Territory&#x27;s voluntary euthanasia law, the federal Parliament passed the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997, which amended the laws granting self-government to the territories–in the Northern Territory&#x27;s case, the &quot;Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978&quot;–to remove that area from the legislative competences of the territories.

==History==
When South Australia turned the Northern Territory over to Commonwealth hands in 1911, the federal government ran the Territory directly through the relevant minister, and the only elective body in the Territory was the Darwin town council. The territory was split in 1927 into the territories of North Australia and Central Australia, both of which had a four-member Advisory Council that was half-elected and half-appointed; in addition, development of North Australia was left to the locally-based North Australia Commission. These changes were reversed in 1931, with the Northern Territory reformed and the federal government resuming control until the 1947 formation of the Northern Territory Legislative Council, which was half-elected and half-appointed.
The Legislative Assembly was created in 1974 by the &quot;Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1974&quot; (Cth), an act of the Australian federal parliament, which was a fully-elected body in contrast to the Legislative Council. The Legislative Assembly consisted of 19 fully elected members, but initially lacked significant powers, until limited self-government was granted in 1978. For the 1983 election, the number of members was increased to 25.

From its inception prior to the 1974 election until the 2001 election, the Legislative Assembly was controlled by the conservative Country Liberal Party, which since 1979 has been affiliated with the federal Liberal–National coalition. In 2001, the Labor Party won a one-seat majority, and Clare Martin became the Territory&#x27;s first Labor and first female chief minister. At the 2005 election, the Martin-led ALP won 19 seats to the CLP&#x27;s 4; however, Martin resigned in 2007 and was succeeded by Paul Henderson as ALP leader, and retained government with another one-seat majority at the 2008 election. Labor lost its majority when Marion Scrymgour went to the cross-benches as an independent. She re-joined the party after Alison Anderson left the party to sit as an independent. Anderson joined the CLP in September 2011. The 2012 election resulted in the return of the CLP under Terry Mills with 16 seats to the ALP&#x27;s 8. Mills resigned in 2013 and Adam Giles became CLP leader. The CLP was reduced to a one-seat majority in 2014 when three CLP members defected to join the Palmer United Party. One defector later rejoined the CLP. After further defections, CLP numbers fell to minority government status in July 2015.

The 2016 election saw a landslide CLP defeat which brought Labor to power led by Chief Minister Michael Gunner. The position of Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was held by CLP-turned-independent MP Kezia Purick from 23 October 2012. Despite Labor&#x27;s massive majority following the 2016 election, the incoming Labor government re-appointed Purick as Speaker. Following an ICAC investigation into allegations Kezia Purick had engaged in corrupt conduct, she resigned, and the role was filled by Chansey Paech on 23 June 2020. Following the 2020 election, Paech resigned in September 2020 to serve as a minister in Gunner&#x27;s cabinet, and Ngaree Ah Kit was acting speaker for a month until her substantive election on 20 October 2020.

<text>The South Australian House of Assembly (also referred to as the lower house) is one of the two chambers of the Parliament of South Australia, the other being the Legislative Council. It sits in Parliament House in the state capital, Adelaide.

==Overview==
The House of Assembly was created in 1857, when South Australia attained self-government. The development of an elected legislature — although only men could vote — marked a significant change from the prior system, where legislative power was in the hands of the Governor and the Legislative Council, which was appointed by the Governor.

In 1895, the House of Assembly granted women the right to vote and stand for election to the legislature. South Australia was the second place in the world to do so after New Zealand in 1893, and the first to allow women to stand for election. (The first woman candidates for the South Australia Assembly ran in 1918 general election, in Adelaide and Sturt.)
From 1857 to 1933, the House of Assembly was elected from multi-member districts, commonly known as &quot;seats&quot;, with each district returning between one and six members. The size of the Assembly varied during this time—36 members from 1857 to 1875, 46 members from 1875 to 1884, 52 members from 1884 to 1890, 54 members from 1890 to 1902, 42 members from 1902 to 1912, 40 members from 1912 to 1915 after the Northern Territory was ceded to federal administration, and 46 members from 1915 to 1938. In 1938, the Assembly was reduced to 39 members, elected from single-member districts.

The House of Assembly has had 47 members since the 1970 election, elected from single-member districts: currently 34 in the Adelaide metropolitan area and 13 in rural areas. These seats are intended to represent approximately the same population in each electorate. Voting is by Instant-runoff voting and preferential voting with complete preference allocation, as with the equivalent federal chamber, the Australian House of Representatives. All members face re-election approximately every four years. The most recent election was held on 19 March 2022.

The House is presided over by a Speaker, who, as of the passage of the &quot;Constitution (Independent Speaker) Amendment Act 2021&quot;, is constitutionally banned from being a member of a registered political party outside of a &quot;relevant election period&quot;.
Another distinctive aspect of the history of the South Australian Parliament was the &quot;Playmander&quot;, a gerrymandering system that instituted a pro-rural electoral malapportionment introduced by the incumbent Liberal and Country League (LCL) government, and in place for 32 years from 1936 to 1968. The already entrenched rural overweighting was increased to a 2:1 ratio, the number of MPs was reduced to 39 and the multi-member seats were abandoned for single-member seats. The House of Assembly now consisted of 26 low-population rural seats, which due to population shifts, were holding up to a 10-to-1 advantage over the 13 high-population metropolitan seats, even though rural seats contained only a third of South Australia&#x27;s population. At the peak of the malapportionment in 1968, the rural seat of Frome had 4,500 formal votes, while the metropolitan seat of Enfield had 42,000 formal votes.

Labor won enough parliamentary seats to form government just once during the Playmander against the odds − in 1965. Labor won comprehensive majorities of the statewide two-party vote whilst failing to form government in 1944, 1953, 1962 and 1968.

More equitable boundaries were subsequently put in place following the 1968, 1975, and 1989 elections.

Most legislation is initiated in the House of Assembly. The party or coalition with a majority of seats in the lower house is invited by the Governor to form government. The leader of that party becomes Premier of South Australia, and their senior colleagues become ministers responsible for various portfolios. As Australian MPs almost always vote along party lines, almost all legislation introduced by the governing party will pass through the House of Assembly.
As with the federal parliament and Australian other states and territories, voting in the Assembly is compulsory for all those over the age of 18. Voting in the House of Assembly had originally been voluntary, but this was changed in 1942.

While South Australia&#x27;s total population is 1.7 million, 1.3 million of them live in Adelaide. Over 75% of the state&#x27;s population resides in the metropolitan area. As a result, Adelaide accounts for 72% (34 of 47) of the seats in the chamber. The dominance of Adelaide, combined with a lack of comparatively-sized rural population centres, results in the metropolitan area frequently deciding election outcomes. At the 2014 election for example, although the state-wide two-party vote (2PP) was 47.0% Labor v 53.0% Liberal, the metropolitan area recorded a 2PP of 51.5% Labor v 48.5% Liberal.

<text>The Legislative Assembly for the Australian Capital Territory (known in short as the ACT Legislative Assembly) is the unicameral legislature of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It sits in the Legislative Assembly Building on Civic Square, close to the centre of the city of Canberra.

Unlike the legislatures of the other mainland states and territories, the Assembly also has the functions of a local council; the city of Canberra has no other local government. It replaced the House of Assembly when the ACT was granted self-government in 1986. Voters had previously rejected self government in a 1978 plebiscite.

==Structure and Membership==
The Legislative Assembly has 25 members, elected from five electorates ― Brindabella, Ginninderra, Kurrajong, Murrumbidgee and Yerrabi ― each having five members. Members are elected for four-year terms by the Hare-Clark system, a variation of the Single Transferable Vote form of proportional representation.

Members of the Legislative Assembly vote to elect a Chief Minister. In practice, Chief Minister is the leader of whichever party is able to form government. The Chief Minister, in turn, selects ministers to form a cabinet. The leader of the second-largest party in the Assembly usually becomes the Leader of the Opposition.

Election dates for the Assembly are fixed in legislation, with elections held on the third Saturday in October every four years (until 1997, elections were held in February). The term of the Assembly was increased in 2004 from three to four years. The last election was held on Saturday the 19th of October, 2024, with the next election expected to be held on 21 October 2028.

===Current electorates===
====Brindabella====

Electing five members to the Assembly, Brindabella contains the town centre and all of the suburbs of Tuggeranong. It also includes all of the ACT which is south of the Murrumbidgee River, thus making it the largest electorate by area. It used to exclude the whole of the suburb of Kambah.

====Ginninderra====

Electing five members to the Assembly, Ginninderra contains the town centre and all of the suburbs of Belconnen excluding Giralang and Kaleen. Its southern boundary was the Molonglo River prior to the 2016 election. It used to exclude the suburbs of Evatt, Lawson and McKellar.

====Kurrajong====

Electing five members to the Assembly, Kurrajong contains all the suburbs of Inner North Canberra, Inner South Canberra and Oaks Estate. It used to include the suburbs of Deakin, Yarralumla, Forrest and Red Hill.

====Murrumbidgee====

Electing five members to the Assembly, Murrumbidgee contains all the suburbs of the Molonglo Valley, Weston Creek, Woden Valley and also includes the suburbs of Deakin, Yarralumla, Forrest and Red Hill. It used to also include the whole of the suburb of Kambah.

====Yerrabi====

Electing five members to the Assembly, Yerrabi contains all the suburbs of Gungahlin as well as the Belconnen suburbs of Giralang and Kaleen and the village of Hall. It used to also include the suburbs of Evatt, Lawson and McKellar.

===Former electorates===
====Molonglo====

Molonglo was an electorate of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly that was contested from the 1995 election to the 2012 election, it covered Inner North Canberra, Inner South Canberra, Weston Creek and most of the suburbs of Woden and Gungahlin. It was a 7-seat electorate.

===Current Government===

The current Chief Minister is Andrew Barr, who is also the Minister for Economic Development and Minister for Tourism and Trade. The position of Chief Minister is analogous to the Premier in the Australian states. Barr is the longest serving Chief Minister in ACT history, as well as the longest serving current Premier or Chief Minister in Australia, having taken the post in December 2014.

The ACT Labor Party has been in power since 2001, although with the exception of 2004-2008, have served in minority or coalition governments with the support of the ACT Greens.

At the 2020 Australian Capital Territory election, 10 Labor members, 9 Liberal members and 6 Greens members were elected.

Following the expulsion of Elizabeth Kikkert from the Canberra Liberals party room on 10 September 2024, the Liberals were left with 8 members, with Kikkert becoming an independent.

At the 2024 Australian Capital Territory election, 10 Labor members, 9 Liberal members, 4 Green members, 1 Independent for Canberra member, and 1 Fiona Carrick Independent member were elected, with Labor to hold power in a minority government.

===Salary===
, Members of the Legislative Assembly are paid a base salary of $188,798, while additional remuneration is provided depending on the additional office or role the member holds. 
==History==
The current Legislative Assembly was created by four acts of the Commonwealth Parliament in 1988, including the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. The first election was held on 4 March 1989 and the assembly first sat on 11 May that year. Until this point, the ACT had been directly administered by the Commonwealth Government. It replaced the House of Assembly (also known for a period as the Legislative Assembly), which existed from 1976 to 1986, but had no executive power, with a principal function of advising the Commonwealth on matters relating to the Territory.

===Historical Composition===
At its inception, the Assembly was elected by a modified d&#x27;Hondt system, the ACT comprised one electorate, electing seventeen members to the Assembly. A 1992 referendum supported the Hare-Clark method, which was introduced for the 1995 election. As of this change, the Legislative Assembly had 17 members, elected from three electorates. Brindabella and Ginninderra elected five members, and the now-defunct electorate of Molonglo elected seven.

On 30 April 2002, the ACT Electoral Commission made a submission to the ACT Legislative Assembly&#x27;s Standing Committee on Legal Affairs, which inquired into the appropriateness of the size of the Legislative Assembly for the ACT, and options for changing the number of members and electorates. The Electoral Commission recommended increasing &quot;the size of the Legislative Assembly to three electorates each returning seven members, giving a total of 21 members&quot;.

In 2014, the Assembly voted to expand the number of members to the present 25, with the change taking effect at the 2016 election.

There has only been one majority government in the history of the Legislative Assembly, with Labor winning 9 of 17 seats at the 2004 election.

===Historical Results===

==Powers==
As with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, the ACT Legislative Assembly lacks the full powers of a state legislature. Section 122 of the Constitution of Australia provides that the Commonwealth Parliament &quot;may make laws for the government of any territory&quot; surrendered by any State to the Commonwealth. The Governor-General, on the advice of the Executive, previously had the power to override laws passed by the Assembly. Although this was rare in practice, the Civil Unions Act 2006, which allowed same-sex couples to enter into &quot;civil unions&quot; was overruled following concerns that the civil unions mimicked marriage. In July 2006, the Federal Government again threatened to overrule the ACT Stanhope Government&#x27;s anti-terror legislation, which was not consistent with other state laws. In 2011 the Federal Parliament passed a private senator&#x27;s bill which removed this power in respect to both the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.

The ACT is unique among Australian states and self-governing territories, as it has no vice-regal post exercising authority as the representative of the monarch, such as a governor or an Administrator. The functions vested in a state Governor or territorial Administrator as nominal head of the Executivecommissioning government, proroguing parliament and enacting legislationare exercised by the Assembly itself and by the Chief Minister. Instead of vice-regal or regal assent, a Bill passed by the ACT Legislative Assembly is enacted on &quot;notification&quot;publication in the Government Gazette of a notice authorised by the Chief Minister. However, the Governor-General of Australia does have the power to dissolve the Assembly if it is &quot;incapable of effectively performing its functions or is conducting its affairs in a grossly improper manner&quot;.

<doc id="579456" wikidata="Q2867120" url="?curid=579456" title="Tasmanian House of Assembly">
<text>The House of Assembly, or Lower House, is one of the two chambers of the Parliament of Tasmania in Australia. The other is the Legislative Council or Upper House. It sits in Parliament House in the state capital, Hobart.

The Assembly has 35 members, elected for a term of up to four years, with seven members being elected in each of five electorates, called divisions. Each division has approximately the same number of electors, and shares its name with one of Tasmania&#x27;s federal electoral divisions. Voting for the House of Assembly is by a form of proportional representation using the single transferable vote (STV), known as the Hare-Clark electoral system. By having multiple members for each division, the voting intentions of the electors are more closely represented in the House of Assembly. This system makes it all but certain that the division&#x27;s minority party wins at least one seat. Additionally, it is easier for minor parties to enter the legislature than in the rest of Australia, allowing them to possibly exert influence through the balance of power (the need for a working majority in the assembly).

At the 2024 state election, the size of the House increased from 25 to 35 members, with seven members elected from the five divisions.

Since 2024, as well as previously from 1959–1998, the quota for election in each division, after distribution of preferences, has been 12.5% (one-eighth). Under the preferential proportional voting system in place, the lowest-polling candidates are eliminated, and their votes distributed as preferences to the remaining candidates. If a candidate achieves a quota, they are declared elected and any surplus votes (those over and above quota) are redistributed according to the next back-up preference marked by the voter.

Most legislation is initiated in the House of Assembly. The party or coalition with a majority of seats in the House of Assembly is invited by the Governor of Tasmania to form Government. The leader of that party becomes the Premier of Tasmania, and their senior colleagues become ministers responsible for various portfolios. As Australian politicians traditionally vote along party lines, most legislation introduced by the governing party will be passed by the House of Assembly.

Unlike other Australian state legislatures, the House of Assembly is elected from multimember districts while the Legislative Council is elected from single-member districts. The reverse is the case in most of the rest of Australia; that is, the lower house is elected from single-member districts while the upper house is elected from multi-member districts or at large.

Tasmania has therefore been described as having an upside down system to the rest of Australia.

==History==
The House of Assembly was first established in 1856, under legislation passed by the British Parliament creating the independent self-governing Colony of Tasmania. The Legislative Council had already existed since 1852. The first elections for the House of Assembly were held in October 1856. The House first met on 2 December 1856 in the area that is now the parliamentary members lounge. The first House had members elected to represent 24 electorates. Hobart had five members, Launceston had three members, and the 22 other electorates each had one member.

In 1870 the multi-member districts were divided and all 32 members were elected in single-member districts.

In 1885 eight two-member districts were instituted. Three were in Hobart, two in Launceston, and there were three others. The remaining 20 members were elected in single-member districts. This number grew by one in 1893 when a seat was added for the West Coast.

In 1897 Tasmania was among the first jurisdictions in the world to use the Hare-Clark proportional representation system to elect some of its members. Hobart elected six members and Launceston four members, in city-wide districts. Voters cast only one vote each, but marked back-up preferences. STV was used again in 1900 in those two cities. By then a second member had been added to the West Coast, bringing total number of members up to 38.

In 1903 first past the post was used to elect each of the members.

In 1906 the state was divided into five equally represented multi-member electorates corresponding to the state&#x27;s five federal electorates. Each electorate returned six members using STV.

In 1959 the number of members per electorate was increased to seven. In 1998 it was reduced to five, resulting in a 25-member parliament. The reduction was criticised by the Greens as an attempt to reduce their influence. In 2010, an attempt to increase the number of seats in the House back to 35 for the 2014 state election was made by the leaders of the three main parties — Labor, the Liberals and the Greens, who signed an agreement on 2 September of that year to submit the proposal for public consideration before taking a set of resolutions to their respective party rooms. The proposal, however, was dropped in February 2011 when the Liberal Party withdrew its support for the plan, citing budget circumstances.

In 2022 legislation was passed to return the House of Assembly to seven-seat districts with the passage of the Expansion of House of Assembly Act 2022, returning the House to 35 seats from the 2024 election onwards. The Legislative Council was not affected and retains 15 seats despite having also been reduced from 19 seats in 1998 at the same time as the House of Assembly.

Unlike most state parliaments in Australia, by-elections are very rare in the House of Assembly. Since 1917, casual vacancies have usually been filled by a simple recount of votes. One of the few by-elections (in legal terms a fresh or &#x27;re-election&#x27;) in recent memory occurred in 1980, when the Supreme Court ordered a new election in Denison because three Labor members had exceeded spending limits.

==Electorates==

With seven members each, the five electoral divisions of the Tasmanian House of Assembly are:

*Bass
*Braddon
*Clark
*Franklin
*Lyons

The electorates of the Tasmanian House of Assembly have the same boundaries and names as the electorates for the federal House of Representatives.

<text>The Tasmanian Legislative Council is the upper house of the Parliament of Tasmania in Australia. It is one of the two chambers of the Parliament, the other being the House of Assembly. Both houses sit in Parliament House in the state capital, Hobart. Members of the Legislative Council are often referred to as MLCs.

The Legislative Council has 15 members elected using preferential voting in 15 single-member electorates. Each electorate has approximately the same number of electors. A review of Legislative Council division boundaries is required every 9 years; the most recent was completed in 2017. Election of members in the Legislative Council are staggered. Elections alternate between three divisions in one year and in two divisions the next year. Elections take place on the first Saturday in May. The term of each MLC is six years.

Tasmanian&#x27;s upper house is unique in Australian politics, in that historically it is the only chamber in any state parliament to be significantly non-partisan. As of 2024, the chamber has a plurality of independents, although it has previously had an outright independent majority.

Unlike other Australian state parliaments, the Tasmanian House of Assembly is elected from multi-member districts, while the Legislative Council is elected from single-member districts. The reverse is the case in most of the rest of Australia; that is, the lower house is elected from single-member districts while the upper house is elected from multi-member districts.

==Overview==
The Council has the power to block supply and force a government to election but cannot itself be dissolved early, because there is nothing in the Tasmanian constitution to allow that. The constitution can only be altered by a vote in each house of parliament, so the Council&#x27;s rights cannot be reduced, and it cannot be abolished, without its agreement.

The Tasmanian Legislative Council has never been controlled by a single political party, with voters in Tasmania tending to elect independents over candidates endorsed by political parties. The Labor Party endorses candidates in some Legislative Council elections, and is the most successful political party in the Council&#x27;s history, having had a total of 20 members elected. The Liberal Party has maintained the view that the Legislative Council should not be a &quot;party house&quot;, and has rarely endorsed candidates who have gone on to win a seat. However, the party has often tacitly backed independent conservatives, many of whom had previously been Liberal candidates or members at state or federal level.

A former Liberal member of the Council, Peter McKay, was first elected as an independent in 1976 but became a Liberal in 1991. Since 2009, the Liberal Party has endorsed candidates more frequently, but it has only ever had three endorsed members elected to the Legislative Council. At the 2009 Pembroke by-election, the endorsed Liberal candidate, Vanessa Goodwin, won the seat. The Tasmanian Greens endorse candidates in Legislative Council elections and won the seat of Hobart at the 2024 Tasmanian Legislative Council periodic election, their first and only Legislative Council success.

Candidates for Legislative Council elections are required by law to restrict their expenditure to a specified limit ($10,000 in 2005; increasing by $500 per year). In addition, no other person or political party may spend money to promote a specific candidate. This requirement is almost unique in Australia. Other than at elections for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, no other jurisdiction imposes expenditure limits on candidates.

The &quot;New South Wales Act 1823&quot;, passed by the British Parliament, separated Van Diemen&#x27;s Land from New South Wales, making it a penal colony under the British Crown and Privy Council. The Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Legislative Council was created in 1825 as an advisory body to the Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. The Legislative Council consisted of six members chosen by the Lieutenant-Governor, who continued to report to the Governor of New South Wales. An Imperial Act in 1828 enabled its expansion to 15 members, with the Lieutenant-Governor as Presiding Officer.

The Council remained fully nominative until the &quot;Australian Colonies Government Act&quot; came into effect in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land on 21 October 1851, when the Council was expanded to 24 members, with 16 elected by the voters and eight nominated by the Governor, who ceased to be a member. The franchise for these elections was extremely limited, with only men over 30 and who owned a certain amount of property eligible to vote. Former convicts, who made up a significant proportion of the colony&#x27;s population, were not able to vote. The 1851 arrangements were a compromise struck by the Governor between the colonists&#x27; demands for representative government and the Colonial Office&#x27;s wish to control the colony through the Governor. The first Speaker of the new Council was Sir Richard Dry.

On 24 October 1856, an Act was proclaimed permitting the introduction of a bicameral, representative Parliament with the creation of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, where the power of the executive government resided, and the abolition of nominee positions on the Council. The Speaker&#x27;s position was renamed President. A distinctive feature of the Act is that it did not enable the Governor to dissolve the Legislative Council.

Like other democratic upper houses of that period, it was established using single-member electorates elected using the first-past-the-post system, with Hobart and Launceston being multi-member electorates. Voters would simply cross off the names of those whom they did not wish to vote for. Members were elected for a six-year term, and terms were staggered in such a way that two or three members&#x27; terms expired each year and elections were held in the first week of May. In the event of resignation or death of a member during their term, a by-election would be held to complete their term.

Reforms in 1907 saw the House of Assembly switch to using the Hare-Clark system with multi-member seats, and introduced preferential voting to the Council. A redistribution in 1946 broke up Hobart and Launceston into single-member electorates.

Suffrage was gradually expanded from the late 19th century onwards, with the property franchise being first eased and then abolished; ex-convicts, ex-servicemen and then women being granted the vote; the age of majority being reduced; and finally, full adult suffrage in 1968. The first woman to sit on the Legislative Council was Margaret McIntyre in 1948; the first woman to chair the upper house was Phyllis Benjamin in 1956.

In the 1990s, various Tasmanian governments attempted to cut the size of parliament. Various reports proposed reducing the Tasmanian Legislative Council from 19 seats to 15. Others including the Morling Report proposed abolishing the Council and merging some of the electorates into the Tasmanian House of Assembly. However the council wouldn&#x27;t agree to any of these proposals. During Tony Rundle&#x27;s government the Legislative Council finally allowed passage of the Parliamentary Reform Bill 1998, reducing the number of seats in the chamber from 19 to 15, and redistributing all seats through an independent Distribution Tribunal, abolishing a previous rural bias which had led to unequal seats. However, the seats were not named after their geographic location, often using land district or county names unfamiliar to most residents, so considerable confusion for voters ensued in determining which seat they were located in.

At the 2024 Tasmanian Legislative Council periodic election, Cassy O&#x27;Connor became the first Tasmanian Greens member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council.

==Electorates==

The 15 single-member electoral divisions of the Tasmanian Legislative Council are:
* Derwent 
* Elwick 
* Hobart 
* Huon 
* Launceston 
* McIntyre
* Mersey 
* Montgomery 
* Murchison 
* Nelson 
* Pembroke 
* Prosser
* Rosevears 
* Rumney 
* Windermere
===Periodic review===
A review of Legislative Council division boundaries is required every 9 years to maintain a population variation of less than 10% between the divisions. This ensures that each member of the Legislative Council represents approximately the same number of electors. Redistribution reviews also take into account the community interest of each division.

The most recent redistribution was completed in 2017 which saw the electorates of Apsley and Western Tiers abolished, and the establishment of the McIntyre and Prosser electorates.

==Members==
===Current distribution of seats===
The current distribution of seats (updated post 2024 Tasmanian Legislative Council periodic elections) is:

==Positions==
===Presiding Officer===

When the Legislative Council of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land was created in 1825 it was a fully nominated body with the Lieutenant-Governor as Presiding Officer. Between 1850 and 1856 the Presiding Officer in the Legislative Council was known as the Speaker. Sir Richard Dry was the first elected to hold this position. As part of wider parliamentary changes the title was changed in 1856 to President.

The current President of the Legislative Council is Derwent MLC Craig Farrell.

==Committees==
===Public Accounts Committee===
The Public Accounts committee is a Joint Committee, meaning that it is composed of members from both houses of parliament. Currently, there are three Legislative Councilors and three Members of the House of Assembly on this committee. This composition is unique in Australia where most Public Accounts Committees are dominated by lower house members.
This committee is commonly referred to as the most powerful committee in an Australian Parliament. It has the power to look into any issue pertaining to the financials of the State, including government agencies, to ensure that money is going where it is intended. The committee can establish its own inquiries, without parliamentary authorisation.

The Committee is currently chaired by Independent member for Murchison, Ruth Forrest.

===Subordinate Legislation Committee===
One of the common functions of Australian upper houses is to scrutinise subordinate legislation. Subordinate legislation is necessary because the executive needs a means of creating rules more detailed than can be in legislation. The Subordinate Legislation Committee is established by statute in Subordinate Legislation Committee Act 1969. This is also a joint committee, composed of three members from each house. 
The Subordinate Legislation Committee examines every regulation made by the executive. If the committee is of the view that the regulation does not comply with the Act under which it was made, it can refer the regulation to the parliament. Either the House of Assemble or the Legislative Council can pass a resolution that disallows the regulation. This disallowance is not retrospective and will not affect the actions taken while the regulation was in effect. If neither House is sitting, then the Committee can force the authority which made the regulation to; amend the regulation to make it consistent with a model suggested by the Committee, rescind the regulation completely, or suspend the regulation until both Houses of Parliament have dealt with the report of the Committee. 
The Subordinate Legislation Committee is not intended to examine the political effect of the regulation, rather they simply examine whether the regulation is clear, conforms with the Act under which it was made, and does not impinge on judicial jurisdiction.

===Public Works Committee===
The Public Works committee is created under the Public Works Committee Act 1914 and is composed of four members, two from the HoA and two from the LC. The function of the Public Works Committee is to examine any proposed public work in Tasmania that will cost more than $5,000,000. The work cannot commence until the committee has passed it. The PWC examines the public value of the work, the necessity of the work, and whether it will produce revenue as expected.

If the Committee decides that it does not meet these standards, then it has the power to prevent work going ahead. The Committee can also suggest changes to a project.

In 2015, the Committee examined the proposal to replace the St Pauls River Bridge outside Avoca. The committee recommended that the new bridge was built but suggested that the old bridge be retained for pedestrian access bridge.

===Sessional Committees===
There are two Legislative Council Sessional Committees, Government Administration A and Government Administration B with half the MLCs on one Committee and half on the other. These are composed entirely of Legislative Councilors. Sessional Committees are always sitting and can examine any issue relating to the Ministry for which they are responsible, or any bill referred to it by the Legislative Council.

An example of a Sessional Committee is the &#x27;Legislative Council Sessional Committee Government Administration A: Sub-Committee Fin Fish Farming in Tasmania&#x27; which held its first hearing on 11 February 2020. This Sessional Committee terms of reference indicate it was established to examine the implementation of the Sustainable Industry Growth Plan for the Salmon Industry in Tasmania.

===Select Committees===
Select Committees are established to conduct an inquiry on one specific issue and then normally cease to exist once they have tabled their final report. The Standing Orders of the LC governs these Committees and the LC can confer powers to examine witnesses or issue summons upon the committee. 
Select Committees can be either Joint Committees or single house committees.

Estimates Committee is considered to be a select committee. The Estimates committees are established by the Legislative Council Standing Orders as a way to ‘examine and report’ on the proposed expenditure in an appropriation (money) bill. It allows the executive to be scrutinised as Independent MLCs can gather facts, consult with the public and hold the executive accountable for the actions they are taking in their budgets. This is especially important as the LC cannot amend money bills.

<doc id="579458" wikidata="Q746290" url="?curid=579458" title="States of Sudan">
<text>Below is a list of the 18 states of the [[Sudan]] (Arabic names are in parentheses). Prior to 9 July 2011, the Republic of the Sudan was composed of 25 states. The ten southern states now form part of the independent country of South Sudan. Two additional states were created in 2012 within the Darfur region, and one in 2013 in Kordofan, bringing the total to 18.

==States of the Republic of the Sudan==
The following 18 states form the territory of the Republic of the Sudan:

==10 states (1956–2011)==


===Special administrative areas===
* The Abyei Area, located on the border between South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan, currently has a special administrative status and is governed by an Abyei Area Administration. It was due to hold a referendum in 2011 on whether to be part of South Sudan or part of the Republic of Sudan.

===Regional bodies===
In addition to the states, there also exist regional administrative bodies established by peace agreements between the central government and rebel groups:
* The Darfur Regional Government was established by the Darfur Peace Agreement to act as a co-ordinating body for the states that make up the region of Darfur.
* The Eastern Sudan States Coordinating Council was established by the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement between the Sudanese Government and the rebel Eastern Front to act as a coordinating body for the three eastern states of Red Sea, Kassala, and Al Qadarif.

== Provinces ==
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was divided into eight provinces, which were ambiguous when created but became well defined by the beginning of World War II. The eight provinces were: Blue Nile, Darfur, Equatoria, Kassala, Khartoum, Kurdufan, Northern, and Upper Nile. In 1948, Bahr al Ghazal split from Equatoria.
==History==
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan had eight &quot;mudiriyat&quot;, or provinces, which were ambiguous when created but became well defined by the beginning of World War II. The eight provinces were: Blue Nile, Darfur, Equatoria, Kassala, Khartoum, Kordofan, Northern, and Upper Nile. In 1948, Bahr al Ghazal split from Equatoria.

There were numerous new provinces created on 1 July 1973. North and South Darfur were created from Darfur, while Kurdufan divided into North and South Kordofan. Gezira and White Nile were split off from Blue Nile. River Nile split off from Northern. Red Sea was split off from Kassala.

A further fracturing of provinces occurred in 1976. Lakes split from Bahr al Ghazal, and Jonglei split off from Upper Nile. Equatoria divided into Eastern and Western Equatoria. There were thus eighteen provinces. In 1991, the government reorganized the administrative regions into nine federal states, matching the nine provinces that had existed from 1948 to 1973. On 14 February 1994, the government reorganized yet again, creating twenty-six &quot;wilayat&quot; (states). The majority of the wilayat were either the old provinces or administrative subregions of a province. As part of the new government structure in South Sudan in 2005, Bahr al Jabal was renamed Central Equatoria. In 2006, West Kurdufan was split and merged with North Kurdufan and South Kordofan.

In January 2012, the new states of Central Darfur and East Darfur were created in the Darfur region, bringing the total number of states to 17. In July 2013, West Kurdufan was reestablished.

Since the 2019 Sudanese coup d&#x27;état, the states in Sudan have been without state governments and legislative councils.

===Former states now part of South Sudan===
On 9 July 2011, the ten southern states became the independent country of South Sudan. They were further divided into 86 counties.

<text>The Rolls-Royce T406 (company designation AE 1107) is a turboshaft engine developed by Allison Engine Company (now part of Rolls-Royce) that powers the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor. The engine delivers 6,000 shp (4,470 kW).

==Development==

In 1982, Detroit Diesel Allison (DDA) prepared a new engine design to enter the United States Army&#x27;s Modern Technology Demonstrator Engine (MTDE) competition, which was expected to be developed into the powerplant for the United States Navy&#x27;s JVX experimental tiltrotor aircraft program (which would eventually become the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey). After this engine, which DDA called the Model 580, lost the competition to Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric in 1983, Allison was separated from Detroit Diesel as a separate division within General Motors, and Allison&#x27;s new management decided to pursue the V-22 engine contract anyway.

On 24 December 1985, the U.S. Navy selected Allison&#x27;s engine for full-scale engine development and production on the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27;s V-22 Osprey. Before the engine was given its United States military aircraft engine designation of T406, it was known as the Model 501-M80C. The Navy and Allison signed a formal contract on 2 May 1986, and the first engine to test ran six months after.

The T406 is based on the Allison T56 turboprop from the P-3 and the C-130, with the free power turbine of the Allison T701 turboshaft from the defunct Heavy Lift Helicopter program.
It was selected over the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW3000 and General Electric GE27 competing for the US Army&#x27;s Modern Technology Demonstrator Engine program. The T406 began flight testing on 19 March 1989.

The T406/AE 1107C Liberty shares a common core with the AE 3007 turbofan and AE 2100 turboprop series of engines, both of which have sold in the thousands of copies. 44-46 percent of parts are common between the T406 and the AE 3007, while about 76 percent of parts are common between the T406 and the AE 2100. In addition, Allison attempted to develop other types of engines based on the T406. In 1988, the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) of West Germany and the China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corporation (CATIC) to work on a version of the MPC 75 regional aircraft to be powered by a T406-derived propfan. In 1990, Allison studied a propfan powerplant driving contra-rotating propellers to power Euroflag&#x27;s proposed military airlift aircraft. Also, the MT7 gas turbines that will be used to power the Ship-to-Shore Connector are a derived design of the T406.

Production continued by Rolls-Royce after it acquired Allison in 1995 to establish a North American subsidiary. In 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the engines failed after less than 400 hours of service, as compared to the estimated life of 500–600 hours. Multiple updates to the engine platform in 2012-2013 have increased the lifespan significantly.

In April 2012, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) ordered 70 AE 1107C engines for the Osprey, with options for up to 268 engines.

Rolls-Royce introduced a Block 3 turbine upgrade, which replaced the old turbine design with sturdier and more efficient components. The upgrade increased engine power by at least 17 percent, and the engine achieved a power output of over during ground testing. The Block 3 turbine became standard in July 2012 for new production models. By September 2012, all older engines that were undergoing regular maintenance were systematically upgraded to the Block 3 turbine.

Engines with a future planned block 4 upgrade would be expected to deliver nearly .

An ongoing problem with the engines was their propensity for surging or stalling with 68 incidents reported between 2003 and October 2016 though this rate had reduced after the introduction of the Block 3 engine version. The US Naval Air Systems Command intends to award Rolls-Royce two contracts to examine the effectiveness of proposed reliability improvements, the first is a software tweak to the engine management software for the compressor guide vanes that internal testing showed could improve surge margin by 0.8% at sea level and 3% at altitude. The second is the discovery that a temperature sensor at the inlet of the compressor sends incorrect readings leading to 2.5% out of 4% steady power shortfall at the compressors correct rotational speed again correctable with a software fix. In addition, Bell Boeing is developing an inlet barrier system to reduce the power loss from the engine ingesting dust and sand particles to supplement the engines existing centrifugal based particle separators as they can only do so much to improve the quality of air they receive.

In October 2021, Bell and Rolls-Royce jointly announced that the Bell V-280 Valor powerplant would switch from the General Electric T64 turboshaft used on the prototype to a derivative of the 1107C used on the Osprey which would be named the 1107F. At the same time as increasing power from 5,000 to 7,000 horsepower, the 1107C is a known element in tiltrotor aircraft with its two decades of prior use which lowers sustainment costs and de-risks the project.

==Design==

The V-22&#x27;s T406 powerplants are housed in wing-tip tilting nacelles, allowing the distinctive flight characteristics of the V-22. For take off and landing the nacelles are directed vertically (90° to fuselage), while for forward flight they are rotated parallel to fuselage. The engine has been considered as a cost-effective upgrade for existing heavylift helicopters such as the CH-47 Chinook and the CH-53.

==Applications==
* Aurora XV-24 LightningStrike (1107C)
* Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey (1107C Liberty)
* Bell V-280 Valor (1107F)
* US Navy Ship-to-Shore Connector Landing Craft (MT7)

<text>The McDonnell Douglas (later Boeing) X-36 &quot;Tailless Fighter Agility Research Aircraft&quot; is an American stealthy subscale prototype jet designed to fly without the traditional empennage found on most aircraft. This configuration was designed to reduce weight, drag and radar cross section, and increase range, maneuverability and survivability.

==Design and development==

The X-36 was built to 28% scale of a possible fighter aircraft and was controlled by a pilot in a ground-based virtual cockpit with a view provided by a video camera mounted in the canopy of the aircraft.

For control, a canard forward of the wing was used as well as split ailerons and an advanced thrust vectoring nozzle for directional control. The X-36 was unstable in both pitch and yaw axes, so an advanced digital fly-by-wire control system was used to provide stability.

First flown on 17 May 1997, it made 31 successful research flights. It handled very well, and the program is reported to have met or exceeded all project goals. McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in August 1997 while the test program was in progress; the aircraft is sometimes referred to as the Boeing X-36.

The X-36 possessed high maneuverability that would be ideal for use as a fighter. Despite its potential suitability, and highly successful test program, there have been no reports regarding further development of the X-36 or any derived design as of 2025.

==Preservation==
*The first X-36 is at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. It arrived on July 16, 2003, the same day as the Boeing Bird of Prey and is displayed in the Museum&#x27;s Research &amp; Development Gallery.
*The second X-36 is displayed outside the Air Force Test Flight Center Museum at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

<text>Flower power was a slogan used during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a symbol of passive resistance and nonviolence. It is rooted in the opposition movement to the Vietnam War. The expression was coined by the American Beat poet Allen Ginsberg in 1965 as a means to transform war protests into peaceful affirmative spectacles. Hippies embraced the symbolism by dressing in clothing with embroidered flowers and vibrant colors, wearing flowers in their hair, and distributing flowers to the public, becoming known as flower children. The term later became generalized as a modern reference to the hippie movement and the so-called counterculture of drugs, psychedelic music, psychedelic art and social permissiveness.

==Origin==
The term &quot;Flower Power&quot; originated in Berkeley, California, as a symbolic action of protest against the Vietnam War. In a November 1965 essay titled &quot;How to Make a March/Spectacle&quot;, Beat poet Allen Ginsberg advocated that protesters should be provided with &quot;masses of flowers&quot; to hand out to policemen, press, politicians and spectators. The use of props like flowers, toys, flags, candy and music were meant to turn anti-war rallies into a form of street theater thereby reducing the fear, anger and threat that is inherent within protests. In particular, Ginsberg wanted to counter the &quot;specter&quot; of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang who supported the war, equated war protesters with communists and had threatened to violently disrupt planned anti-war demonstrations at the University of California, Berkeley. Using Ginsberg&#x27;s methods, the protest received positive attention and the use of &quot;flower power&quot; became an integral symbol in the counterculture movement.

==Movement==

By late 1966, the Flower Power method of guerilla theater had spread from California to other parts of the United States. The Bread and Puppet Theater in New York City staged numerous protests which included handing out balloons and flowers with their anti-war literature. &quot;Workshop in Nonviolence&quot; (WIN), a magazine published by New York activists, encouraged the use of Flower Power. 

In May 1967, Abbie Hoffman organized the Flower Brigade as an official contingent of a New York City parade honoring the soldiers in Vietnam. News coverage captured Flower Brigade participants, who carried flowers, flags and pink posters imprinted with LOVE, being attacked and beaten by bystanders. In response to the violence, Hoffman wrote in WIN magazine, &quot;Plans are being made to mine the East River with daffodils. Dandelion chains are being wrapped around induction centers... The cry of &#x27;Flower Power&#x27; echoes through the land. We shall not wilt.&quot; On the following Sunday, WIN activists declared Armed Forces Day as &quot;Flower Power Day&quot; and held a rally in Central Park to counter the traditional parade. Turnout was low and, according to Hoffman, the rally was ineffective because guerilla theater needed to be more confrontational.

In October 1967, Hoffman and Jerry Rubin helped organize the March on the Pentagon using Flower Power concepts to create a theatrical spectacle. The plan included a call for marchers to attempt to &quot;levitate&quot; the Pentagon. When the marchers faced off against more than 2500 Army national guard troops forming a human barricade in front of the Pentagon, some demonstrators held out flowers and a few placed their flowers in the soldiers&#x27; rifle barrels.
Photographs of flower-wielding protesters at the Pentagon march became iconic images of 1960s anti-war protests. One photo called &quot;The Ultimate Confrontation&quot; (by French photojournalist Marc Riboud), showed 17-year-old high school student Jan Rose Kasmir clasping a chrysanthemum and gazing at bayonet-wielding soldiers. &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; later described the photo, which was published throughout the world, as &quot;a gauzy juxtaposition of armed force and flower child innocence&quot;.

Another photo from the march, titled &quot;Flower Power&quot; (by &quot;Washington Star&quot; photographer Bernie Boston), was nominated for the 1967 Pulitzer Prize. The photo shows a young man in a turtleneck sweater placing carnations in the rifle barrels of military policemen. The young man in the photo is most commonly identified as George Edgerly Harris III, an 18-year-old actor from New York who later performed in San Francisco under the stage name of Hibiscus. According to writer and activist Paul Krassner, however, the young man was Yippie organizer &quot;Super-Joel&quot; Tornabene. Harris died in New York in the early 1980s during the early stages of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, while Tornabene died in Mexico in 1993.

On 10 December 1971, John Lennon, an outspoken critic of the war, appeared at a rally for John Sinclair, a political activist and founding member of the White Panther Party, who had been sentenced to 10 years for marijuana possession. He said, &quot;OK so Flower Power didn&#x27;t work. So what. We start again.&quot;

By the early 1970s, the Flower Power anti-war movement had faded primarily due to the end of the military draft in 1972 and the start of American withdrawal from combat activities in Vietnam in January 1973.

==Cultural heritage==
The iconic center of the Flower Power movement was the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco, California. By the mid-1960s, the area, marked by the intersection of Haight and Ashbury streets, had become a focal point for psychedelic rock music. Musicians and bands like Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin all lived a short distance from the famous intersection. During the 1967 Summer of Love, thousands of hippies gathered there, popularized by hit songs such as &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot;. 

A July 7, 1967, &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover story on &quot;The Hippies: Philosophy of a Subculture&quot;, and an August CBS News television report on &quot;The Hippie Temptation&quot;, as well as other major media exposure, brought the hippie subculture to national attention and popularized the Flower Power movement across the country and around the world. That same summer, the Beatles&#x27; hit single &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; served as an anthem for the movement. On 25 June, the Beatles performed the song on the &quot;Our World&quot; international satellite broadcast, ensuring that the pacifist message reached an audience estimated at 400 million.

The avant-garde art of Milton Glaser, Heinz Edelmann, and Peter Max became synonymous with the flower power generation. Edelman&#x27;s illustration style was best known in his art designs for the Beatles&#x27; 1968 animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Glaser, the founder of Push Pin Studios, also developed the loose psychedelic graphic design, seen for example in his seminal 1966 poster illustration of Bob Dylan with paisley hair. It was the posters by pop artist Peter Max, with their vivid fluid designs painted in Day-Glo colors, which became visual icons of flower power. Max&#x27;s cover story in &quot;Life&quot; magazine (September 1969) as well as appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, further established &quot;flower power&quot; style art into mainstream culture.

<text>The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, honors individuals who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving the sport, and is the central point for the study of the history of baseball in the United States and beyond, displaying baseball-related artifacts and exhibits. Elections of worthy individuals to be honored by induction into the Hall of Fame commenced in 1936, although the first induction ceremonies were not held until the hall opened in 1939. Through the elections for , a total of 346 people will have been inducted, including 274 former professional players, 39 executives/pioneers, 23 managers, and 10 umpires. Each is listed showing his primary position; that is, the position or role in which the player made his greatest contribution to baseball according to the Hall of Fame.

According to the current rules, players must have at least 10 years of major league experience to be eligible for induction. In addition, they must be retired for at least five years if living, or deceased for at least six months. Players meeting these qualifications must pass through a screening committee, and are then voted on by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). Each writer may vote for up to 10 players; to be admitted into the Hall of Fame, a player must be approved by 75% of those casting ballots. Players receiving less than 5% approval are removed from future BBWAA ballots. The rules, as revised in July 2016, allow that all individuals eligible for induction but not for the BBWAA ballot—players who have not been approved by the BBWAA election process within 15 years of their retirement, umpires, managers, pioneers, and executives—may be considered by one of four voting bodies that have taken over the role of the former Veterans Committee, based on the era in which each individual candidate made his greatest contribution to the sport. On a few occasions, exceptions have been made to the guidelines in place at the time: Lou Gehrig was elected in 1939 following his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Roberto Clemente was elected shortly after his death in 1972; and Addie Joss was elected in 1978 even though he completed only nine seasons before his death.

Between 1971 and 1977, nine players from the Negro leagues were inducted by a special Negro Leagues Committee, which was given the task of identifying worthy players who played in the Negro leagues prior to the breaking of baseball&#x27;s color line. Since 1977, players from the Negro leagues have been considered by the Veterans Committee, and nine more individuals have been approved by that body. In 2005, the Hall announced the formation of a Committee on African-American Baseball, which held a 2006 election for eligible figures from the Negro leagues and earlier 19th-century teams; 17 additional Negro leagues figures were chosen in that election, including executive Effa Manley, the first woman inducted.

In the table below, &quot;primary team&quot; is based on the inductees&#x27; biographies at the Hall of Fame website. This does not necessarily match the cap logo on the inductee&#x27;s Hall of Fame plaque (if applicable; those inducted as executives are shown without caps, and many early players are depicted without cap logos because logos were not in use during the individuals&#x27; careers).


==Notes==
* Prior to the 2001 re-organization of the Veterans Committee, the percentage of the vote generally was not released for candidates selected by the committee.
* Percentage of the vote was not released for candidates approved by the Committee on African American Baseball (2006).
* Ford Frick&#x27;s two tenures as an executive included his stints as the president of the National League (1934–1951) and Commissioner of Baseball (1951–1965).
* Lou Gehrig was elected by acclamation at the December 1939 winter meetings of the BBWAA.
* There were no regular elections in 1940, 1941, 1943, and 1944, as the Hall decided to hold elections every three years as opposed to annually. Landis was elected in a special election shortly after his death in November 1944. Annual elections resumed in 1946, one year after the end of World War II.
* There was no event in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns over the members of the Hall who were able to attend the event. The extended Class of 2021 features those elected in December 2019 (veterans&#x27; committee), January 2020 (BBWAA), and January 2021 (BBWAA). The planned December 2020 Veterans Committee elections, in the Golden Age and Early Baseball Eras, were postponed until December 2021.
