<text>David Auburn (born 30 November 1969) is an American playwright, screenwriter and theatre director. He is best known for his 2000 play &quot;Proof&quot;, which won the 2001 Tony Award for Best Play and Pulitzer Prize for Drama. He also wrote the screenplays for the 2005 film version of &quot;Proof&quot;, &quot;The Lake House&quot; (2006), &quot;The Girl in the Park&quot; (2007), and &quot;Georgetown&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Auburn was born in Chicago, Illinois, to parents Mark and Sandy Auburn. He was raised in Ohio until 1982 when his family moved to Arkansas. After graduating from high school in 1987, he attended the University of Chicago, where he was a member of Off-Off Campus, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in 1991. Following a one-year fellowship with Amblin Entertainment, he moved to New York City in 1992. Auburn spent two years in the Juilliard School&#x27;s playwriting program, studying under the noted dramatists Marsha Norman and Christopher Durang.

==Career==
Auburn wrote several short plays, collectively grouped as &quot;Fifth Planet and Other Plays&quot;. The plays, called &quot;cockeyed and engaging little one-act comedies&quot;, were presented at Beowulf Alley Theatre Company, Tucson, Arizona, in January and February 2008. The plays are: &quot;Fifth Planet&quot;, &quot;Miss You&quot;, &quot;Are You Ready&quot;, &quot;Damage Control&quot;, &quot;Three Monologues&quot;, &quot;What Do You Believe About The Future?&quot; and &quot;We Had A Very Good Time&quot;. &quot;Fifth Planet&quot; is a two-person play with 44 short scenes. &quot;Miss You&quot; is a &quot;telephone play about love and unfaithfulness&quot; with a two-person cast, with each actor playing 2 roles, named &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot;. &quot;We Had A Very Good Time&quot; follows a married couple at the end of a vacation in an unnamed foreign country. &quot;Damage Control&quot; concerns a political consultant preparing his political boss for a speech about a scandal the politician is involved in. &quot;What Do You Believe About The Future?&quot; appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and has since been adapted for the screen.

Auburn&#x27;s first full-length play, &quot;Skyscraper&quot;, ran Off Broadway in September – October 1997. It concerns a group attempting to save a historic skyscraper from being demolished.

Auburn is best known for his 2000 play &quot;Proof&quot;, which won the 2001 Tony Award for Best Play, as well as the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. He adapted it into a film, which was released in 2005.

His play &quot;The Columnist&quot; had its world premiere in a production by the Manhattan Theatre Club on Broadway, running from April 3, 2012 through June 3, 2012 and starring John Lithgow with Boyd Gaines, Margaret Colin, Stephen Kunken, Marc Bonan, Grace Gummer and Brian J. Smith, with direction by Daniel Sullivan. &quot;Lost Lake&quot; premiered Off-Broadway in a Manhattan Theatre Club production at New York City Center—Stage 1, running from November 11 to December 21, 2014. Directed by Daniel Sullivan, the two-person cast starred John Hawkes and Tracie Thoms. The play was developed at the Eugene O’Neill Playwrights Conference and presented at the Sullivan Project at the University of Illinois in February 2014. The first reading of &quot;Lost Lake&quot; was done at the O&#x27;Neill Center Rose Theater Barn July 26–27, 2013, directed by Wendy C. Goldberg and starring Frank Wood and Elsa Davis.

Auburn has been awarded the Helen Merrill Playwriting Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He received the Kesselring Prize in 2000 for &quot;Proof&quot;; the prize is given to a playwright who shows the most promise and comes with a $10,000 monetary award.

Following &quot;Proof&quot;, he wrote the screenplay for the movie &quot;The Lake House&quot;, released by Warner Bros. in 2006. In 2007, he made his film directorial debut with &quot;The Girl in the Park&quot;, for which he also wrote the screenplay. He has also directed stage works. He directed the play &quot;Sick&quot; by Zayd Dohrn at the Berkshire Theatre Festival from August 18 to September 6, 2009. He directed &quot;Anna Christie&quot; by Eugene O&#x27;Neill at the Berkshire Theatre Festival in July 2013.

<text>Over is a village in the civil parish of Almondsbury in South Gloucestershire, England, north of Bristol. It lies on the B4055, a road that parallels the M5 from Junction 17 to 16. The road, known locally as Over Lane, abuts to the east a ridge which overlooks the Severn floodplain, dominated by Bristol Golf Club or Course. According to local legends, a ghost of an old woman haunts this place every New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Over Court had a large deer park, which was largely replaced in the 20th century by the golf venue.

A similar deer park was higher and to the north at Knole Park, the house of which was centred on a small knoll which was a fortified Roman camp. Most of its grounds have been replaced by a large brick quarry, Springwood Nurseries and Almondsbury&#x27;s paired garden centres which are notable for large outdoor areas.

Beyond the clustered settlement, before the lane climbs to the north it passes over the London to South Wales Main Line, a railway emerging from Patchway Tunnel before heading across the Severn floodplain to the Severn Tunnel. Its main station is Bristol Parkway station a few miles to the southeast. Via mainly rural, linear Easter Compton parish or footpaths and tiny lanes which follow the line closely Pilning railway station is a walk about away. The area is road-dominated and the loss of the deer parks has led to little tourism. In 2015 Pilning it was the sixth least used station in the UK — 68 passenger entries/exits were recorded for the year.

<text>Tony Fletcher (born 27 April 1964) is a British music journalist best known for his biographies of drummer Keith Moon and the band R.E.M., and also as a show director for the Rock Academy in Woodstock.

==&quot;Jamming!&quot;==
Born in Yorkshire, England, Fletcher was inspired by the London punk rock movement and started a fanzine as a thirteen-year-old schoolboy which he named &quot;Jamming!&quot;. Founded in 1977, the magazine began as a school-printed fanzine and in 1978, with the fifth issue featuring interviews with Paul Weller, Adam Ant and John Peel, adopted professional printing and wider distribution. From 1979-84, it was printed and partly distributed by Better Badges. Between 1978-83, &quot;Jamming!&quot; featured interviews with a range of artists that included Pete Townshend, Aztec Camera, Dexys Midnight Runners, the Damned, Delta 5, the Jam, Bill Nelson, Scritti Politti, the Selecter, the Beat, Dead Kennedys and more.

In September 1983, &quot;Jamming!&quot; went bi-monthly, and later monthly. Artists featured in this later phase included the Smiths, U2, Billy Bragg, Julian Cope, Lloyd Cole, the Cocteau Twins, Echo and the Bunnymen, R.E.M., the Specials, Everything But the Girl, Madness, and more. In January 1986, after 36 issues, the magazine shut down.

==Media career==
His success with &quot;Jamming!&quot; led Fletcher to more opportunities, starting with a major published interview with Paul McCartney in 1982. He presented TV programmes, including &quot;The Tube&quot;, where he interviewed Wham! in 1983, and networked with post-punk figures including Paul Weller and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, the latter being the subject of his first book, published in 1987.

Fletcher also juggled band and record label management, before moving to New York City in the late 1980s.

Fletcher produced and co-hosted 2019&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Pixies Podcast&quot;, which broke new ground by unveiling the recording process of Pixies&#x27; then upcoming album &quot;Beneath the Eyrie&quot; before it had been released.

In 2020, Fletcher also launched the fitness and travel podcast &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, inspired by spending most of 2016 traveling around the world with his then-wife and 11 year old son.

==New York==
In New York, Fletcher established himself as a DJ, club promoter and music industry consultant, all the while settling down as a serious scholar of contemporary music history, authoring a guide to the music of the Clash, plus major biographies of R.E.M. and Keith Moon.

With the advent of the Internet in the 1990s, Fletcher returned to topical writing, with his ijamming.net website, adding wine to his musical interests.

In 2010, he published a study on the musical history of New York City in the 20th century.

His biography of the Smiths, &quot;A Light That Never Goes Out: The Enduring Saga of the Smiths&quot;, was published in September 2012.

On 4 July 2013, William Heinemann published Fletcher&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Boy About Town&quot; about his youth in London.

He is currently a show director at the Rock Academy in Woodstock.

==Personal life==
Fletcher has two children and was married to Posie Strenz. He lives in upstate New York. He became a vegetarian and later a vegan inspired by the 1985 album &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;.

<doc id="567883" wikidata="Q7977981" url="?curid=567883" title="Weakly harmonic function">
<text>In mathematics, a function formula_1 is weakly harmonic in a domain formula_2 if 
:formula_3

for all formula_4 with compact support in formula_2 and continuous second derivatives, where Δ is the Laplacian. This is the same notion as a weak derivative, however, a function can have a weak derivative and not be differentiable. In this case, we have the somewhat surprising result that a function is weakly harmonic if and only if it is harmonic. Thus weakly harmonic is actually equivalent to the seemingly stronger harmonic condition.

<text>WWWQ (99.7 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Atlanta, Georgia, United States, carrying a contemporary hit radio format known as &quot;Q99.7&quot;. Owned by Cumulus Media, WWWQ serves the Atlanta metropolitan area as the regional affiliate for &quot;The Daly Download with Carson Daly&quot; and is the flagship station of &quot;The Bert Show&quot; and &quot;Elliott &amp; Nina&quot;. WWWQ&#x27;s studios are located in the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs, while the station transmitter resides in Atlanta&#x27;s Druid Hills neighborhood. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WWWQ broadcasts over three HD Radio channels with the second and third subchannels simulcast over low-power FM translators and is available online.

==History==
===Early years (WLTA)===
The station first signed on the air as WLTA on November 5, 1963. It was owned by Atlanta FM Broadcasters and had an easy listening format, playing 15 minute sweeps of instrumental cover versions of popular songs, along with Hollywood and Broadway showtunes. In 1974, the station was acquired by the Susquehanna Broadcasting Company.

Oddly, one of its most popular music blocks in the late 1970s was &quot;Golden Sundays&quot;, created and hosted by Jim Rich. It was a rock &amp; roll oldies specialty show, heard from 8 to 10 p.m., originating live from a restaurant in Sandy Springs. To appeal to younger listeners, WLTA began playing several soft vocals each hour. Around 1980, the playlist was approximately 50% vocals and 50% instrumentals; over time, the station gradually eliminated the instrumentals, switching to Soft Adult Contemporary. During the 1979-80 NHL season, WLTA served as the flagship station of the Atlanta Flames hockey team in their final season before being sold and moved to Calgary.

===Warm 100 (WRMM/WARM-FM)===
In 1983, after WSB-FM also changed to Soft AC, WLTA increased its tempo and opened up its announcers&#x27; personalities, and would change call letters to WRMM and rebrand as &quot;Warm 100.&quot; By 1985, with digital-tuning radios taking over from analog dials, the station began calling itself &quot;Warm 99,&quot; since modern radios would show the dial position as 99.7 MHz. That did not sit well with WSB-FM&#x27;s parent company, Cox Radio, who would sue, claiming &quot;copyright infringement.&quot; In a landmark case, &quot;Cox v. Susquehanna Broadcasting&quot;, the judge was handed a digital radio and asked to tune to 100.0 MHz. There was no signal, because it was between channels. To find the nearest station, he pressed the &quot;scan&quot; button, and it stopped on WKHX-FM at 101.5 MHz. Next, he entered 99.0 MHz, which again is between channels and so contained no signal. Scanning from there, the radio hit 99.7.

In his precedent-setting decision, the federal district judge stated that on a radio dial &quot;a radio station&#x27;s frequency is its address&quot; and one cannot copyright an address. He ruled in favor of Warm 99. A short time later, WSB-FM became known as &quot;B98.5.&quot; WRMM would adjust its call letters slightly around this time, switching to WARM-FM.

===Power 99 (WARM-FM/WAPW)===

At 3 p.m. on March 5, 1986, WARM-FM went head-to-head with dominant local Top 40 station WZGC, and flipped to the format as &quot;Power 99.7.&quot; The new format launched with &quot;The Power of Love&quot; by Huey Lewis &amp; the News. Z-93 eventually lost its lead, and shifted to a more rhythmic contemporary format as &quot;Hot New Z-93&quot; before flipping to classic rock in January 1989. WARM-FM changed its call letters to WAPW on February 10, 1988, and would rebrand as the more familiar &quot;Power 99.&quot;

By the early 1990s, &quot;Power 99&quot; was considered to be one of the dominant Top 40 stations in the Southeast. However, declining ratings, as well as the success of Nirvana at the end of 1991 and the subsequent rise of &quot;alternative&quot; music, gave station management pause. In early September 1992, Susquehanna brought in Will Pendarvis to host an all-alternative program on weeknights called &quot;Power 99 On the Edge&quot;. After receiving a solid amount of positive feedback, the station decided to make the full switch.

===99X (WNNX)===

On October 26, 1992, at noon, &quot;99X&quot; made its debut, with &quot;Video Killed The Radio Star&quot; by The Buggles being the first song played. A month later, on November 27, 1992, the WAPW call letters were replaced with WNNX.

99X became one of the most influential alternative rock stations in the United States, and played a key role in breaking numerous acts during its early years. Music director Sean Demery&#x27;s push behind The Cranberries&#x27; &quot;Linger&quot; in 1993 helped earn the band national attention in the U.S. On a trip to Australia in early 1995, program director Brian Phillips brought back a copy of fledgling band Silverchair&#x27;s debut EP, which the station began to spin. The day after the release of the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;Frogstomp&quot;, the band gave its first US performance at the Roxy in Atlanta as a &quot;99X Freeloader Show.&quot;

WNNX&#x27;s personalities during this era included Steve Barnes, Jimmy Baron, Leslie Fram, Steve Craig, Sean Demery, Will Pendarvis, Fred &quot;Toucher&quot; Toettcher and Rich Shertenlieb; the latter two would later find success in Boston as hosts of &quot;Toucher and Rich&quot; on WBZ-FM. The station also hosted a weekly live performance series named &quot;Live X&quot;.

On May 5, 2006, Cumulus Media acquired Susquehanna Radio and all of its stations, including WNNX and sister station Q100. Over the next 20 months, Cumulus continued to support WNNX&#x27;s alternative rock format, despite a noticeable decline in the Arbitron ratings.

===Q100/Q99.7 (WWWQ)===
The current format for WWWQ originated on January 23, 2001, on 100.5 FM, when that frequency was reallocated to the Atlanta radio market from Anniston, Alabama. On January 11, 2008, Cumulus announced they would move the Top 40/CHR format of &quot;Q100&quot; from 100.5 to 99.7, and move &quot;99X&quot; to the HD2 sub-channel of 99.7 and 99x.com, at 5:30 a.m. on January 25. The final song on &quot;99X&quot; at 99.7 was &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; by Green Day. The call signs between the two stations would swap on January 29. (The current WNNX would flip to a mainstream rock format as &quot;Rock 100.5&quot;, before flipping to a classic alternative format under the &quot;99X&quot; branding in December 2022.)

Under Cumulus ownership, WWWQ briefly moved to a Hot AC format in 2009, but by 2010, had returned to CHR.

On January 2, 2019, WWWQ rebranded as &quot;Q99.7&quot;.

==Current programming==
Weekday programming includes &quot;The Bert Show&quot;, Yvonne Monet, Jade&#x27;, and &quot;Eliott&quot;. Weekend programming includes &quot;The Daly Download with Carson Daly&quot;.

===WWWQ-HD2===

WNNX signed on HD Radio operations in December 2004, with WNNX-HD2 carrying classic alternative rock branded as &quot;99XS&quot;. Along with the format and call sign switches between WNNX and WWWQ on January 25, 2008, WNNX-HD2 (renamed WWWQ-HD2) adopted the former alternative rock format heard on WNNX, retaining the 99X brand. WWWQ-HD2 would add a simulcast via low-power translator W250BC (97.9 FM) on April 16, 2009. This simulcast would be moved to W258BU (99.1 FM) on June 9, 2011; following a few days of airing on both translators, as well as a period of stunting, W250BC would flip to a 80s/90s hits format branded as &quot;Journey 97.9&quot;, this time relaying WWWQ&#x27;s HD3 subchannel. A power increase for W258BU included a frequency change to 98.9 FM on September 15, 2011, using the W255CJ calls.

WWWQ-HD2 dropped the &quot;99X&quot; format for the first time on September 1, 2012, flipping to active rock as &quot;The Bone&quot;. This format was incorporated into WNNX&#x27;s format on February 1, 2013, with WWWQ-HD2 flipping to country-leaning Contemporary Christian as &quot;98.9 The Walk&quot;; by August 25, 2013, the subchannel and translator switched to oldies (as &quot;Oldies 98.9&quot;) and switched again to Nash Icon on August 15, 2014. A stunt with Christmas music under the &quot;Warm 98.9&quot; brand began over WWWQ-HD2 on November 23, 2015, and was followed by a week-long stunt with adult contemporary starting on December 26; both the subchannel and translator reverted to alternative rock as &quot;99X&quot; at Midnight on January 1, 2016.

WWWQ-HD2 would temporarily lose its translator simulcast on April 12, 2018, when W255CJ was ordered off-air by the FCC due to interference complaints by WWGA in Tallapoosa. Following installation of a directional antenna to protect WWGA&#x27;s signal, W255CJ resumed operations on December 21, 2018.

===WWWQ-HD3===
WWWQ-HD3 launched with the debut of &quot;Journey 97.9&quot; on June 9, 2011, promoted as a &quot;journey&quot; through 1980s and 1990s popular music. This format was dropped on September 4, 2012, in favor of a loop of the then-current Top 20 popular music songs, as well as newer hit music, modeled after SiriusXM&#x27;s now-defunct Top 20 on 20 channel. Branded &quot;Q100 20 @ 97.9&quot;, this was meant to compete with WWPW, which flipped to CHR the week before. On November 25, 2014, WWWQ-HD3 and W250BC flipped to classic hip hop as &quot;OG 97.9&quot;, several hours before Radio One-owned WAMJ-HD2 flipped to the same format.

<text>Almondsbury () is a large village and civil parish in South Gloucestershire, England. It is situated on the A38 road in the Avon Green Belt north of Bristol city centre. It is adjacent to junction 16 of the M5 motorway and Almondsbury Interchange, where the M4 and M5 cross. It is part of the Bristol Built-up Area.

The civil parish also includes the villages of Hortham, Gaunt&#x27;s Earthcott, Over, Easter Compton, Compton Greenfield, Hallen and Berwick.

The village is split by a steep hill, part of the escarpment overlooking the Severn floodplain. At the bottom of the hill is Lower Almondsbury where a pub and hotel, The Bowl Inn, is situated. South Wales, the Forest of Dean, the River Severn and both Severn Bridges are visible from the higher parts of the village, which consists mainly of ribbon development along the A38 and has more of an urban characteristic.

==Governance==
Almondsbury is in the South Gloucestershire unitary authority area. Almondsbury is part of the Severn Vale electoral ward, which elects two of the 61 members of South Gloucestershire Council.

Historically, Almondsbury was in Thornbury Rural District from 1895 to 1974, and then the Northavon district of the county of Avon from 1974 to 1996, when South Gloucestershire was created.

For elections to the UK Parliament, Almondsbury is in the Thornbury and Yate constituency, which is represented by Claire Young of the Liberal Democrats. Historically, it was in the Thornbury constituency from 1885, moving to Stroud and Thornbury at the 1950 election, South Gloucestershire in 1955, Northavon in 1983, and Filton and Bradley Stoke in 2010.

==History==
The place-name &#x27;Almondsbury&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Almodesberie&quot;. The name means &#x27;Æthelmod&#x27;s or Ealhmund&#x27;s burgh or fortified place&#x27;.
The local church, dedicated to Saint Mary the Virgin, was built in 1140 AD. The lead-covered spire was added to the original tower some time before 1619.

In 1817, a woman purporting to be Princess Caraboo was found in the town, in what was to become one of the more elaborate deceptions of the period.

==Amenities==

The Bown Inn pub takes its name from the bowl shape of the land surrounding the estuary. Parts of this whitewashed-stone inn were originally the three cottages erected in 1146 to house the monks building the adjacent church of St Mary the Virgin. The present building became a licensed inn in 1550.

Another pub, The Swan Inn, is located on the A38 in the upper part of the village, almost opposite an open space known as Almondsbury Tump.

In March 2009 a community shop was opened in the village by the not-for-profit Almondsbury Community Services Association, situated opposite the Old School Hall at 14 Church Road. The community shop is staffed entirely by unpaid volunteers. The aim of the project goes beyond a &quot;village shop&quot;, being a service for the village, to support local suppliers wherever possible, and to be another focal point where people in the village can meet. A proportion of the surplus generated by the shop is returned to community projects and organisations in the village. In 2018, the village community purchased the premises from the church through a Community Share issue. The chairman of the shop committee is John Mclevy.

The village also has an ambulance station, a motorway police station, a garden centre, and a restaurant/pub. A helicopter base is present next to the Almondsbury Interchange as a new home for National Police Air Service Filton and the Great Western Air Ambulance.

===Education===
Education is provided by Almondsbury Church of England Primary School. This is a state maintained school. The most recent Ofsted report has been rated outstanding. For secondary education, Almondsbury is served by The Castle School and Marlwood School.

==Sport and leisure==

Almondsbury is home to non-League football club Almondsbury F.C. who play at Almondsbury Sports &amp; Social Complex on Gloucester Road. Almondbury Cricket Club and Almondsbury Tennis club are also based at the same site. Gloucestershire FA are also based in Almondsbury at Oakland Park. North Bristol RFC play next door.

Almondsbury is home to St Nick&#x27;s Gaelic Athletic Association club.

==Notable residents==

* Sir Miles Partridge (1488-1551), Courtier to King Henry VIII, Head of Court entertainment which included gambling evenings, infamous for winning a bet with Henry VIII, a gift of St. Paul’s Jesus Bells. He removed and broke them as a defiant gesture and publicity stunt for the reformation. (Cite: Sir Miles Partridge of Bristol and Almondsbury, a Royal Servant, by N.A. Deas 2000, MS, Bristol Libraries).
* Cattelena (died 1625), an African woman, kept a small dairy business in Almondsbury during the early 17th century.

== Civil parish ==
The civil parish of Almondsbury is much larger than the village. It includes the villages of Hortham, Gaunt&#x27;s Earthcott, Over, Easter Compton, Compton Greenfield, Catbrain and Hallen. It also includes Cribbs Causeway and the site of the village of Charlton, now the western end of Filton Airfield.

When it was originally created in 1866 the civil parish also included Patchway, but not Easter Compton, Compton Greenfield, Hallen, Cribbs Causeway or Charlton, all of which were transferred from the parish of Henbury in 1935. The parish of Patchway was separated from Almondsbury in 1953.

<doc id="567897" wikidata="Q953425" url="?curid=567897" title="Italian football league system">
<text>The Italian football league system, also known as the Italian football pyramid, refers to the hierarchically interconnected league system for association football in Italy. It consists of nine national and regional tournaments, the first three being professional, while the remaining six are amateur, set up by the Italian Football Federation. One team from San Marino also competes. The system has a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels.

In theory, it is possible for a lowly local amateur club to rise to the pinnacle of the Italian game and win the &quot;Scudetto&quot;. While this may be unlikely in practice (at the very least, in the short run), there certainly is significant movement within the pyramid. A notable example is AC ChievoVerona, which from the lower division went to Serie A, the highest level, reaching as good as 4th place in 2005–06 Serie A. The top two levels contain one division each. Below this, the levels have progressively more parallel divisions, which each cover progressively smaller geographic areas.

==History==
The Genoa Cricket and Athletic Club, later known as the Genoa Cricket and Football Club was established on 7 September 1893, Italy&#x27;s fourth oldest football team (after Torino F.C.C., Nobili Torino and Internazionale Torino), and the oldest active Italian football team, with 13 decades of activity. In March 1898, the Italian Football Federation (&quot;Federazione Italiana del Football&quot;, later re-called &quot;Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio&quot;, FIGC) was set up in Turin. With four clubs joining Genoa, &quot;FC Torinese&quot;, &quot;Internazionale di Torino&quot; and the &quot;Società Ginnastica di Torino&quot; (&quot;Gymnastic Society of Torino&quot;). Other clubs existed but decided not to join. The first championship took place on a single day, May 8, 1898, in Torino. The title was won by Genoa.

FIGC joined FIFA in 1905 and the championship moved to a league structure, based on regions, in the same year.

After the interruption of World War I, football popularity grew and smaller clubs joined. In the summer of 1921, a second association was briefly created in competition with the FIGC: the &quot;Confederazione Calcistica Italiana&quot; (CCI), emerged from an argument between major and minor clubs over the structure of the national leagues. Hence in 1922 Italy had two champions &quot;US Pro Vercelli&quot; and &quot;US Novese&quot;. The two groups eventually re-merged at the end of the season.

The move to a single national league structure occurred in 1929 with initially eighteen teams in the top league. The first winners in 1930 were Internazionale. The national team also won the World Cup in 1934 and 1938.

After World War II the league briefly returned to a regional structure with a north–south divide and a play-off for a single year before Serie A was restored. Torino were the first post-war league champions and went on to win four in a row. However, it is Juventus, Milan and Internazionale that have dominated the league since World War II, having won the title in 57 of the 74 seasons.

The current league system dates back to 1978, when semi-professional sector was disbanded. In that year, the current Lega Pro (then known as &quot;National Semiprofessional League&quot;) which ruled Serie C and Serie D, turned in a fully professional league organizing new Serie C1 and Serie C2. Italy so became the only country having two distinct professional football leagues, 14 years before England. In 2010, with the split between Lega Serie A and Lega Serie B, Italy became the sole country with three professional leagues. The Serie C was brought back in 2014, abolishing Serie C1 and Serie C2.

==Structure==

The system uses the principle of promotion and relegation. The first tier of Italian football is Serie A, which is governed by the Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A and is made up of 20 teams. The second tier is Serie B, which is organised by the Lega Nazionale Professionisti B. Both of these leagues cover the whole of Italy.

The third tier is Serie C. It is run by the Lega Italiana Calcio Professionistico; it has three divisions of 20 clubs each, which are generally split on the basis of location.

At the fourth tier is Serie D, a league of nine parallel divisions (in which the clubs are divided by geographical location) that is organised by the &quot;Dipartimento Interregionale&quot; of the Lega Nazionale Dilettanti. Beneath these are five further levels; three of them, Eccellenza, Promozione and Prima Categoria, are organised by regional committees of the Lega Nazionale Dilettanti; and the last two levels, Seconda Categoria and Terza Categoria, by provincial committees.

All 100 Serie A, Serie B and Serie C clubs are professional.

From 2005—2006 season, if two or more teams end the league with the same number of points, the final place is given from following criteria (that count for every division):

#Head-to-head records;
#Goal difference of head-to-head records;
#Goal difference of regular season;
#Most of goals scored;
#Draw.

==Women==
The women&#x27;s system is divided into five levels. From 2002 to 2013, the Serie A2 existed between the Serie A and B, but it has since been renamed to B.

<text>Huỳnh Công Út, known professionally as Nick Ut (born March 29, 1951), is a Vietnamese-American photographer who worked for the Associated Press in Los Angeles. He won both the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and the 1973 World Press Photo of the Year for his 1972 photograph &quot;The Terror of War&quot;, depicting children running away from a napalm bombing attack during the Vietnam War. In 2017, he retired. Examples of his work may be found in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.

==Biography==
Born in Long An, Vietnam (then part of French Indochina), Ut began to take photographs for the Associated Press when he was 15, just after his older brother Huynh Thanh My, another AP photographer, was killed in Vietnam. His closest friend in the Saigon bureau, Henri Huet, also died in 1971 after volunteering to take the weary Ut&#x27;s place on an assignment.

After the fall of Saigon in 1975, Ut himself was wounded three different times in the war in his knee, arm, and stomach. He moved to Tokyo and arrived in Los Angeles two years later.

==&quot;The Terror of War&quot;==
&quot;The Terror of War&quot;, also colloquially called &quot;Napalm Girl&quot;, is Ut&#x27;s best-known photograph and features a naked 9-year-old girl, Phan Thị Kim Phúc, running toward the camera from a South Vietnamese napalm strike that mistakenly hit Trảng Bàng village instead of nearby North Vietnamese troops on June 8, 1972. Before delivering his film with the photograph, Ut set his camera aside to rush 9-year-old Kim Phuc to a hospital, where doctors saved her life. He said: &quot;I cried when I saw her running... If I don’t help her, if something happened and she died, I think I’d kill myself after that&quot;.

The publication of the photograph was delayed due to the AP bureau&#x27;s debate about transmitting a naked girl&#x27;s photograph over the wire.

Audiotapes of then-president Richard Nixon in conversation with his chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, show that Nixon doubted the veracity of the photograph, musing whether it may have been &quot;fixed&quot;.

In September 2016, a Norway newspaper published an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg after censorship was imposed on this photograph placed on the newspaper&#x27;s Facebook page. Half of the ministers in the Norwegian government shared the photograph on their Facebook pages, among them prime minister Erna Solberg from the Conservative Party. Several of the Facebook posts, including the Prime Minister&#x27;s post, were deleted by Facebook, but later that day, Facebook reinstated the picture and said &quot;the value of permitting sharing outweighs the value of protecting the community by removal&quot;.

A 2025 documentary, &quot;The Stringer&quot; investigates the authorship of the photo and claims that it was not taken by Ut but by a Vietnamese photographer named Nguyễn Thành Nghệ. Ut and Associated Press both refute the claim.

==Family and later career==

Ut is a United States citizen and is married with two children in Los Angeles. His photos of a crying Paris Hilton in the back seat of a Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s cruiser on June 8, 2007, were published worldwide; however, Ut was photographing Hilton alongside photographer Karl Larsen. Two photographs emerged; the more famous photograph of Hilton was credited to Ut despite being Larsen&#x27;s photo.

After working for the &quot;Associated Press&quot; for 51 years, Ut retired in 2017. The photography community in Los Angeles held a retirement party to celebrate Ut&#x27;s career and exhibit his work (including that iconic Pulitzer Prize-winning photo) at &quot;The Perfect Exposure Gallery&quot; in Los Angeles.

In 2021, Nick Ut was awarded the National Medal of Arts for his work during the Vietnam War. On the eve of receiving the award, Ut published an essay in &quot;Newsweek&quot; explaining why he decided to accept the medal from President Donald Trump despite political concerns surrounding the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The next day, while out to dinner with a friend, Nick Ut was attacked by a stranger in downtown Washington, D.C.. He fell to the ground, hit the metal fence surrounding the tree, and hurt his ribs, back, and leg. It is unclear whether this attack was for political reasons or just coincidental. After the incident, Ut received many calls asking about his health, including from Kim Phuc.

== Accolades ==

Nick Ut&#x27;s iconic photograph, &quot;The Terror of War&quot;, won every major photographic award, such as the Overseas Press Club honoring him with the Best Photograph, Daily Newspaper or Wire Service. The George Polk Awards for News Photography, the World Press Photo for Photo of the Year, and the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography. He was the 2014 Lucie Awards honoree for Achievement in Photojournalism. Kerala Media Academy in India presented him with the World Press Photographer Prize in 2019.

On the 40th anniversary of that Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph in September 2012, Ut became only the third person inducted into the Leica Hall of Fame for his contributions to photojournalism. In 2021, he became the first journalist to receive the National Medal of Arts, the highest award given to artists and arts patrons by the United States federal governments.

<doc id="567905" wikidata="Q609571" url="?curid=567905" title="Hannes Hafstein">
<text>Hannes Þórður Pétursson Hafstein (4 December 1861 – 13 December 1922) was an Icelandic politician and poet. In 1904 he became the first Icelander to be appointed to the Danish Cabinet as the minister for Iceland in the Cabinet of Deuntzer and was – unlike the previous minister for Iceland Peter Adler Alberti – responsible to the Icelandic Althing.

==Biography==

Hannes was born on the farm Möðruvellir in Hörgárdalur valley. His parents were Pétur Havstein (17 February 1812 – 24 June 1875) Governor of North and East Iceland and Kristjana Gunnarsdóttir Havstein (20 September 1836 – 24 February 1927) sister of Iceland&#x27;s first bank chairman, Tryggvi Gunnarsson.

He obtained the national grammar school leaving certificate (stúdentspróf) in 1880 and obtained a law degree (lower second class) from the University of Copenhagen in 1886. He was member of Alþingi in 1900–1901, 1903–1915 and 1916–1922, and attended his last meeting there in 1917.

He was proposed the first Minister for Iceland on 31 January 1904 from 1 February 1904, and he served as such until 31 March 1909. Then he became the managing director of the Bank of Iceland. In 1912 he was elected speaker of Althingi, prior to becoming Minister for Iceland for the second time from 24 July 1912 to 21 July 1914, when he became managing director again. In 1917 his declining health forced him to resign his duties.

Hannes Hafstein died in Reykjavík on 13 December 1922. In 1931 a statue of Hannes by sculptor Einar Jónsson was unveiled in Reykjavik. The roundels on his and his wife&#x27;s graves (see photo to left) were also by Einar Jónsson.

As a poet, Hannes Hafstein mostly wrote in the national romantic tradition, often with a humorous, even satirical, touch. His poems – like Hannes himself – were highly popular with the Icelandic people.

<text>was an airline with its headquarters on the grounds of Fukuoka Airport in Hakata-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. It was owned by Japan Air System (later &quot;Japan Airlines Domestic&quot; in 2004), operating domestic passenger services.

Scheduled flights were wholly sold by Japan Airlines, therefore no ticket carried JH. Essentially, Japan Airlines wet leased them.

==History==

The airline was established on 20 January 1997 and started operations on 19 December of that same year as an affiliate of Japan Air System. 

In November 2001, JAS announced it&#x27;s merger with Japan Airlines. On April 30, 2005, Harlequin Air was integrated into Japan Airlines Domestic.

==Fleet==
During its eight-year existence, Harlequin Air operated only two aircraft (both leased from its parent Japan Air System):

<doc id="567909" wikidata="Q313035" url="?curid=567909" title="DaMarcus Beasley">
<text>DaMarcus Lamont Beasley (; born May 24, 1982) is an American former professional soccer player. A left-footed player, Beasley played both as a left winger and left-wing back throughout his career. He retired from soccer after the 2019 MLS Season. On November 26, 2022, National Soccer Hall of Fame announced that he, along with fellow U.S. Men&#x27;s national teammate Landon Donovan, was selected for induction. He was inducted on May 6, 2023.

After starring at the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship, Beasley emerged as a star with the Chicago Fire before making a move to Dutch club PSV Eindhoven in 2004. He later spent time in the Premier League with Manchester City, in the Scottish Premier League for Rangers and in the Bundesliga for Hannover 96. He finished his career with spells with Puebla and Houston Dynamo.

Beasley is the only U.S. man to play in four FIFA World Cups, his first in 2002 and his latest in 2014, earning 126 caps during his 16-year international career.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Beasley joined IMG Academy, the United States Soccer Federation&#x27;s Residency program in Bradenton, Florida. Before moving to Florida, Beasley played at South Side High School for two years. Beasley starred in the 1999 Under-17 World Cup in New Zealand, winning the Silver Ball as the tournament&#x27;s second best player, behind teammate Landon Donovan.

===Chicago Fire===
Beasley signed with MLS on March 16, 1999, and was allocated to the LA Galaxy. However, before making any appearances with LA, he was traded in February 2000 to the Chicago Fire in exchange for first-round picks in the 2000 MLS SuperDraft and 2001 MLS SuperDraft. He would excel with Chicago, scoring 14 goals and recording 20 assists over 4.5 seasons while being named to the league Best XI in 2003. He was close to signing for Southampton FC in 2004, but MLS rejected the offer much to Beasley&#x27;s displeasure.

His stay with the Fire ended on July 19, 2004, when Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven agreed on a transfer fee with MLS worth $2.5 million. He signed a four-year contract.

===PSV===
PSV manager Guus Hiddink brought Beasley in as the successor to Arjen Robben (who went to Chelsea), and because of that, Beasley was granted the number 11 jersey. In his first season in the Eredivisie, Beasley played 29 games, scored 6 goals in 34 domestic games of the Dutch season and helped PSV win their 18th league title. On May 28, 2005, PSV advanced to the final of the 2004–05 KNVB Cup by defeating Feyenoord in a penalty shootout after Beasley&#x27;s goal in the final minute of regulation tied the match.

In addition to making an impact on the domestic level, Beasley became the first American to play in the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League, against Milan. In the first leg, PSV lost 2–0 at the San Siro, while in the second leg, PSV won 3–1 at Philips Stadion, though they were eliminated based on the away goals rule. Despite the loss, Beasley was an important player, leading his team with 4 goals in 12 Champions League matches.

DaMarcus was fined €1,500 ($1,852) for driving under the influence of alcohol as a result of an incident on January 16, 2006. His Dutch driving privileges were suspended for the next three months, followed by a three-month probationary period.

===Manchester City===
After a disappointing individual season for Beasley in which PSV won their 19th championship, on August 31, 2006, he joined English Premier League side Manchester City on a season-long loan fulfilling his ambition to play in England. However, his first few weeks with City were troubled by injury, limiting his ability to play. On December 30, Beasley scored his first goal for City, a match-winner in the 83rd minute against West Ham United. He went on to score three times more before returning to PSV after making 22 appearances in total.

===Rangers===
Scottish Premier League club Rangers signed Beasley for £700,000 in June 2007. He became the second American to play for the Rangers&#x27; first team, after Claudio Reyna. On August 4, 2007, Beasley made his Rangers debut, playing a full 90 minutes in a 3–0 win against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Beasley scored his first goal for the club against FK Zeta in a Champions League qualifier on August 7, 2007, becoming the first American to score for two clubs in the competition. During the match, Beasley was subjected to racial taunting by Zeta fans, along with fellow black teammate, Jean-Claude Darcheville. He urged UEFA and FIFA to do something about the chants, which prompted an investigation intended to crack down on the crowds at soccer matches. Beasley scored his first Scottish Premier League goal in Rangers&#x27; 2–1 win over Kilmarnock on August 25, 2007.

On October 2, 2007, Beasley was influential in Rangers 3–0 win against Lyon in the Champions League group stage. He was involved in all three Rangers goals in a victory for the Scottish side. His inswinging corner was headed in by Lee McCulloch to give Rangers a 1–0 advantage. Beasley&#x27;s wide pass to Alan Hutton allowed him to spring free and set up Daniel Cousin for the second. Finally, Beasley took a 50-meter aerial pass from Cousin while on the run, controlled, and finished. Beasley was named Man of the Match.

During a Champions League match against VfB Stuttgart, Beasley was hurt in a collision with goalkeeper Raphael Schäfer. This left him unable to complete the match and he was substituted. The true extent of the injury meant that he was expected to miss the rest of the Scottish Premier League season. However, Beasley was named in the Rangers squad for the match against Dundee United on May 10. He made his return on May 19 against St Mirren. His first start for Rangers after his injury came in the Scottish Cup final against Queen of the South; he notched a goal and an assist in the 3–2 victory.

On August 23, 2008, in a Scottish Premier League match against Aberdeen at Pittodrie Stadium, Beasley looked to have scored his first goal of the campaign, though the goal was wrongly ruled out for offside. Beasley helped Rangers win the SPL title for 2008–09, being awarded a championship medal after appearing in ten league matches during the season.

During the 2009–10 season, Beasley saw little playing time with Rangers. He stated in December 2009 that he would seek a move away from the club during the upcoming January transfer window in order to secure a place in the United States squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Shortly after this declaration, Beasley was given a run of games in the Rangers team during the month of December. He had some impressive performances, scoring in games against Dundee United and Motherwell. After the Motherwell game Beasley expressed his desire to stay with Rangers and help them retain the Scottish Premier League title. Although Rangers won the title, Beasley was not entitled to a championship medal, having played in only eight games, less than the 25% required.

===Hannover 96===
On August 30, 2010, Beasley signed a two-year contract with German Bundesliga club Hannover 96. He made his debut on September 18, 2010, coming on as a substitute in the 77th minute in a 2–0 away loss to VfL Wolfsburg.

===Puebla===
On June 22, 2011, Beasley joined Mexican Primera División side Puebla. Beasley scored his first goal for Puebla in his unofficial debut against Monterrey in the Copa Tijuana. On July 23, Beasley made his competitive debut for &quot;Los Camoteros&quot; in a 1–0 win over Atlas in the opening match of the 2011 Apertura Season. He scored his first competitive goal for Puebla on August 21 in a 2–1 win over Pumas UNAM.

===Houston Dynamo===
On July 23, 2014, Beasley joined Major League Soccer club Houston Dynamo as a designated player. He made his Dynamo debut on August 3, 2014, starting at left back against DC United in a 1–0 win. Beasley suffered a hamstring injury on October 12 that ended his 2014 season. He appeared in 10 games for the Dynamo in his first year with Houston.

==International career==
Beasley was capped over 100 times for the United States national team, participating in four FIFA World Cups. He was also a key part of the United States team that won the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013 &amp; 2017 as a viewer. For the 2013 Gold Cup, Beasley was the team&#x27;s captain.

<text>The coach in ice hockey is the person responsible for directing the team during games and practices, prepares strategy and decides which players will participate in games.

==Role==
As each game is given great importance, a coach will analyse past games and prepare for future games. Coaches are important in determining the style of hockey the team plays. While winning is a primary goal at the professional level, at the other extreme of minor hockey, teaching is given greater importance.

The specific responsibilities of a coach vary according to the level at which they are coaching. For example, unique to coaching at the professional level, a coach, especially a head coach, needs to have skills in dealing with the media. In sport, the role of an expert coach entails more than teaching. Position or skill coaches such as for goaltenders or skating development. Support coaches include Video coaches and Strength and conditioning coach. Professional coaching staffs will include multiple Assistant coaches and sometimes an Associate coach. Associate coaches are a step above a normal assistant coach and one step below a head coach.

==Youth Hockey==

The role of a youth ice hockey coach is a combination of teacher, motivator, organizer, listener, and disciplinarian. In addition, there are many other responsibilities that a youth hockey coach will fulfill. Some responsibilities include: facilitator, demonstrator, evaluator, supporter, and planner.
In the case of coaching of youth hockey, while strategy and tactic skills are still required, there would be the added responsibility of teaching participants the fundamental skills and rules of the game; providing a fun and safe environment; developing character; teaching physical fitness; and having the ability to communicate in a positive manner.

Youth coaches influence the degree of enjoyment experienced by youth and their desire to continue participating in sport. This influence occurs through the coaches’ goals, values, attitudes, and behaviors.

==Coaching preparation==
Prior to coaching on the ice in the United States, coaches must complete a certification course and age specific modules sanctioned by USA Hockey and then register with USA Hockey. Coaching clinics for certification are offered at various locations across the country, broken down by districts. Formal coaching education programs are not the only way coaches are developed. Other learning opportunities, such as playing experience, mentoring, and discussions with other coaches play a significant role.

==Game plan==
A coach should focus their attention on individual skill development first. Individual skill development should be mastered prior to focusing on competition. For players to become successful in a team situation, they must develop their skating, stick handling, passing, and shooting skills. Individual skill development is the foundation for every player and of primary importance before advancing in competitive situations.

<doc id="567917" wikidata="Q1188326" url="?curid=567917" title="J-Air">
<text>J-Air is a Japanese regional airline with its headquarters in the Terminal Building in Itami Airport near Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan and its main hub at Itami Airport. J-Air previously had its headquarters in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture. Its operations include scheduled passenger services to 17 destinations across regional Japan, under Japan Airlines flight numbers. The airline has a fleet of 35 aircraft, consisting of Embraer 170s and 190s linking tier-two and tier-three cities in Japan as to bypass JAL&#x27;s congested hub in Tokyo (both Narita and Haneda).

J-Air is a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan&#x27;s flag carrier, Japan Airlines (JAL) and an affiliate member of the Oneworld alliance. The airline was founded on 8 August 1996, when JAL restructured JAL Flight Academy and J-Air was separated; and began operations as a separate entity from Hiroshima-Nishi Airport on 1 November. Faced with limited opportunities for route expansion at Hiroshima, the airline relocated to its new home at Nagoya Airfield, after the opening of Chūbu Centrair International Airport, on 17 February 2005. In the fiscal year ended 31 March 1999, J-Air, together with its sister airlines within the JAL Group, carried over 32 million passengers and over 1.1 million tons of cargo and mail.

== History ==
JAL Flight Academy (JFA) was established by Japan Airlines (JAL) in April 1991, as a flight training school subsidiary based at Omura Airport, Nagasaki. It provided conversion training for its flight engineers to become pilots. In April 1991, a new division of JFA was created to operate scheduled services to succeed the troubled &quot;Nishi Seto Airlink&quot; services, a commuter airline serving cities in western Japan. Since the introduction of the 19-seats Jetstream 31s (JS31) in September 1991, the aircraft progressively replaced the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante inherited from &quot;Nishi Seto&quot;.

In August 1996, JAL Flight Academy was restructured, J-Air was separated and established as a wholly owned regional subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines on 8 August. On 1 November, the airline inaugurated its first flight from Hiroshima-Nishi Airport and was building up service on smaller-demand domestic routes, which larger aircraft could not serve economically. However, the local government subsidy was terminated at the end of the 2000 fiscal year and the airline was required to become self-sufficient. As part of its domestic marketing strategy, JAL found a niche market where the 100-plus-seats Boeing 737s were too large and frequent services were in demand, and began repositioning the airline. Fifty-seats Bombardier CRJ200s were introduced and progressively replaced the five JS31s until completion in August 2003.

Despite the introduction of the CRJ200s, there were limited opportunities for route expansion from its home at Hiroshima-Nishi Airport. The airline decided to move to Nagoya Airfield, after the opening of Chūbu Centrair International Airport. On 17 February 2005, J-Air formally relocate to its new home at Nagoya Airfield. In order to strengthen the recognition of the JAL brand and improve customer convenience, the airline disposed its own flight numbers and changed to JAL flight numbers from 1 April 2005. At the same time, it formally ended flight to Hiroshima-Nishi which has been the airline base for almost 9 years with the last flight to Miyazaki.

On 1 April 2007, J-Air, together with four of its sister airlines within the JAL Group, joined Oneworld and became a Oneworld affiliate member. On 18 June, JAL signed a purchase agreement with Embraer for ten Embraer 170 jets, with options to acquire another five aircraft. The contract value was worth approximately US$435 million, if all the options are exercised. The aircraft will be used for linking tier-two and tier-three cities in Japan as to bypass the airline&#x27;s congested hub in Tokyo. The aircraft was configured to seat 76 passengers in a single-class layout and was designated for J-Air. The first aircraft was delivered on 3 October 2008, received the type certification from the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB) on 27 October and operated its first flight in February 2009.

J-Air has been reported by Japanese newspapers and television to be leaving Nagoya Airfield in a phased transition with many flights leaving October 2010 and all flights leaving by end of March 2011.

== Historical liveries ==

J-Air had many liveries over the years. In the following order:

=== 1991 to 2002: J-AIR livery ===
A fusion of the J-AIR letters with a red square separating the &#x27;J&#x27; and the &#x27;AIR&#x27; titles, and a grey band feature on the fuselage.

=== 2002 to 2011: Arc of the Sun livery ===
After Japan Airlines (JAL) and Japan Air System (JAS) merged, the Tokyo office of Landor and JAL worked together again to create a new brand identity. Landor devised a livery referred to as the &quot;Arc of the Sun&quot;. The 2000s rebranding began in April 2002 and was completed in April 2004. The brand identity firm designed 300,000 specific items for JAL. The JAL acronym remained, but it was changed to include a curved bar, which replaced the simple red square and gray rectangle used from 1989 (1991 For J-AIR). The curved bar was likened to a samurai sword. The tail now featured a quarter sun outlined in silver. JAL changed its branding again on 1 April 2011, reverting to the original 1959 brand, with slight modifications, as part of their post-bankruptcy rebrand.

=== 2011-Present: Tsurumaru J-Air livery ===
The J-Air livery is called the &quot;tsurumaru&quot; (鶴丸) or &quot;crane circle.&quot; It is an image of a Japanese red-crown crane with its wings extended in full flight. The Tsurumaru logo of its parent (Japan Airlines) was created in 1958 by Jerry Huff, the creative director at Botsford, Constantine and Gardner of San Francisco, which had been the advertising agency for Japan Airlines from its earliest days.

<doc id="567924" wikidata="Q537692" url="?curid=567924" title="Filton">
<text>Filton is a town and civil parish in South Gloucestershire, England, north of Bristol. Along with nearby Patchway and Bradley Stoke, Filton forms part of the Bristol urban area and has become an overflow settlement for the city.

Filton has large areas of open space which include several playing fields, a golf course and the former Filton Airport (closed in 2012).

==Connections, districts and facilities==
Filton can be reached from Junction 1 of the M32 motorway, or from Junction 16 of the M5 motorway. The town is well served by rail with Filton Abbey Wood serving areas in the south of the town, Bristol Parkway serving areas to the north and east and Patchway in the west of the town.

Districts within the town include East Filton, Filton Park and Northville. East Filton, which has grown up east of the Bristol-South Wales railway line and is mostly in the neighbouring civil parish of Stoke Gifford, contains the offices of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s Defence Procurement Agency, plus a shopping park. Filton Park is a suburb of Bristol and lies directly on the city border, sandwiched between the A38 trunk road and Southmead Road. Filton itself lies to the north and east of Filton Park. Monks Park is to the south. Housing in Filton Park is mainly privately owned, semi-detached and 1930s built. Pre-World War I properties in the district tend to be quite large, with generous gardens. Extensive playing fields border the north-western side of Southmead Road. The golf links, on the hillside beyond, is owned by Filton Golf Club. The area has a primary school and a playgroup. Filton Park is regarded as a desirable place to live since it is close to major centres of employment such as BAE Systems, and Defence Equipment &amp; Support at Abbey Wood.

Filton Church was begun in around 1340 but is much altered.

Filton&#x27;s educational facilities include South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, Abbeywood Community School and several primary schools. The University of the West of England is at nearby Frenchay.

Filton has two main shopping areas – the Shield Centre (on the site of the former Shield Laundry) and Abbey Wood Retail Park, as well as other shops. To the east of the town there is a small area of woodland known as Splatt&#x27;s Abbey Wood.

==Industry==

Filton has an aerospace connection dating back to the establishment of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. Aerospace companies in Filton include BAE Systems, Airbus, GKN, Rolls-Royce and MBDA, all located around the former Filton Aerodrome. The Concorde supersonic airliner was built here in the late 1960s and 1970s; on 26 November 2003 Concorde 216 (G-BOAF) made the final flight of a Concorde, returning to Filton to be kept there permanently as the centrepiece of the Aerospace Bristol museum, which opened in 2017. This museum also houses the Bristol Aero Collection and examples of planes, helicopters, missiles and other engineering projects built in Filton and Bristol.

Other employers include the MOD, Viridor, Hewlett-Packard, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the Royal Mail. Filton is also home to the regional blood processing facility, NHS Blood and Transplant Filton.

Bristol Cars made hand-built luxury cars in Filton from 1946 until 2011. The company has neither distributors nor dealers and deals directly with customers; they have a showroom and head office in Kensington, London. They claimed to be the last wholly British-owned luxury car builder. The company went into administration in March 2011, and was acquired by the research and development firm Kamkorp.

== Population ==
The population of the parish at the 2011 Census was 10,607. The Filton built-up area defined by the Office for National Statistics is a large outer suburban area north of Bristol which includes Almondsbury, Patchway, Little Stoke, Stoke Gifford and Bradley Stoke, and had a population of 59,495 in 2011.

Filton is an ethnically diverse town, with a proportion of white British residents close to the national average.

== Administration ==

Filton Town Council is a parish council made up of thirteen councillors and forming the first tier of local government.

Filton was in Gloucestershire until 1974, when it became part of the newly formed county of Avon. When the Avon authority was abolished in 1996, the area became part of the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire and rejoined the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire.

Filton is represented in the House of Commons by Claire Hazelgrove, Labour Member of Parliament for the constituency of Filton and Bradley Stoke.

An electoral ward with the same name has the same boundaries as the parish, and elects two members of South Gloucestershire Council.

==History==
Thousands of mites, farthings and other coins of the Roman emperors, Domitian, Constantine and Constans were found in a bank by some boys in 1880. Many of the coins were in excellent condition.

The name of the town comes from the Old English &quot;feleþe&quot; (hay), and &quot;tūn&quot; (farm, field). The name dates back to at least 1187.

At the start of the 20th century, Filton was a small village, still detached from the city of Bristol to the south. Farming was the principal occupation. However, there was a large factory-like laundry in the village, opposite Filton House, owned by Samuel Shield. The Bristol to South Wales railway line passed through the village. There was a small station near the site of the current Abbey Wood station. A much larger railway station, known as Filton Junction, opened in 1910, after the alternate rail route from Bristol to London was finished. In 1907 the northern terminus for Bristol Tramways was moved out from Horfield to Filton. Tram production in the tramway sheds commenced in 1908. The manufacture of aeroplanes started in the Bristol Tramway sheds in 1910 and aero-engine production started in 1920.

Between the wars, Filton expanded rapidly to become a suburb of Bristol. Initially development (semi-detached housing) was concentrated on the western side of the A38, in an area known as Filton Park. In the 1930s, the area on the eastern side of the A38 started to be developed. Eventually, Filton became part of the Bristol conurbation, although it remained, as it does now, outside the city boundary. During the 1920s and 1930s, two infant/primary schools and one secondary school were built in Filton to accommodate the growing number of school-age children in the area. Many of these children were evacuated when World War II started in 1939, but returned later, during the Phoney War. Filton High School, originally a grammar school, but later a comprehensive, started to take pupils in 1960. In 2010 Filton High was demolished and replaced with Abbeywood Community School.

In the late 1940s, the main runway of Filton Aerodrome was greatly extended for the Bristol Brabazon project. Charlton village was demolished and the pre-war Filton bypass was severed. In the early 1960s, a new bypass was constructed, roughly parallel to the old one, and this later became part of the M5 motorway.

In the early 1950s the Bristol Aeroplane Company opened a purpose-built technical college to help train their apprentice intake. Attached to the college were also basic training workshops. In 1960 the education authority opened Filton Technical College on the opposite side of Filton Avenue to the BAC college. Later the various colleges merged and eventually became the South Gloucestershire and Stroud College.

Sandwiched between roads, factories, railway lines and the aerodrome, Filton expanded little after World War II. However, from the late 1970s a trading estate slowly developed on the eastern side of the Bristol/South Wales railway line in what is now known as East Filton. During the mid-1970s the A38 trunk road was upgraded to a dual carriageway. Station Road, a country lane in the early part of the 20th century, was also widened to become a dual carriageway and form part of the Avon Ring Road. In 1973, the Rolls-Royce car division was separated as Rolls-Royce Motors. Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited (the engine division) was privatised in 1987 as Rolls-Royce plc. Later, the Ministry of Defence set up a large office complex, known as Abbey Wood, in the same area.

==Twin towns==
Filton is twinned with:
*St Vallier-sur-Rhône, France
*Witzenhausen, Germany

==Sport==
*The Bristol Academy of Sport is based at South Gloucestershire and Stroud College. Bristol City W.F.C. are based at the Stoke Gifford Stadium on site.
*Filton Cycling Speedway Club was formed in January 2006. The club uses a cycle track built by Filton Town Council and recognised to be one of the best in the country, with its setting in Elm Park. 
*St Vallier FC (named after its French twin) is a youth football team.
*Filton Golf Club has an 18-hole course.
*There is also a table tennis club.

==Climate==
Filton has a temperate maritime climate, with comfortable, mostly dry summers and cold, mostly wet winters. The temperature is usually between at or below freezing () on 39.4 days per year and , but between 2005 and 2022, the temperature ranged from to .

<doc id="567927" wikidata="Q2315928" url="?curid=567927" title="Ice hockey rink">
<text>An ice hockey rink is an ice rink that is specifically designed for ice hockey, a competitive team sport. Alternatively it is used for other sports such as broomball, ringette, rinkball, and rink bandy. It is a rectangle with rounded corners and surrounded by walls approximately high called the &quot;boards&quot;.

== Name origins ==
&quot;Rink&quot;, a Scots word meaning &#x27;course&#x27;, was used as the name of a place where another game, curling, was played. Early in its history, ice hockey was played mostly on rinks constructed for curling. The name was retained after hockey-specific facilities were built.

== Dimensions ==
There are two standard sizes for hockey rinks: one used primarily in North America, also known as NHL size, the other used in Europe and international competitions, also known as IIHF or Olympic size.

=== International ===

Hockey rinks in the rest of the world follow the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) specifications, which are with a corner radius of .

The two goal lines are from the end boards, and the blue lines are from the end boards.

=== North American ===

Most North American rinks follow the National Hockey League (NHL) specifications of with a corner radius of . Each goal line is from the end boards. NHL blue lines are from the end boards and apart. The difference in width from the international standard represents a significant difference in width-to-length ratio on the ice.

=== Origins ===
The rink specifications originate from the ice surface of the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, constructed in 1862, where the first indoor game was played in 1875. Its ice surface measured . The curved corners are said to originate from the design of the Montreal Arena, constructed in 1898.

== Markings ==

=== Lines ===
The &quot;centre line&quot; divides the ice in half crosswise. It is used to judge icing. It is a thick line, and in the NHL must &quot;contain regular interval markings of a uniform distinctive design, which will readily distinguish it from the two blue lines&quot; (i.e. it must not be a solid single colour as the blue lines are). It may also be used to judge two-line pass violations in leagues that use such a rule. 

There are two thick &quot;blue lines&quot; that divide the rink into three parts, called zones. The blue lines are used to judge if a player is offside. If an attacking player crosses the line into the other team&#x27;s zone before the puck does, they are said to be offside.

Near each end of the rink, there is a thin red &quot;goal line&quot; spanning the width of the ice. It is used to judge goals and icing calls.

=== Faceoff spots and circles ===
There are 9 &quot;faceoff spots&quot; on a hockey rink. All faceoffs take place at these spots. There are two spots in each team&#x27;s defensive zone, two at each end of the neutral zone, and one in the centre of the rink.

There are &quot;faceoff circles&quot; around the centre ice and end zone faceoff spots. There are hash marks painted on the ice near the end zone faceoff spots. The circles and hash marks show where players may legally position themselves during a faceoff or during in-game play.

==== Spot and circle dimensions ====
Both the centre faceoff spot and centre faceoff circle are blue. The circle is 30 feet (9m) in diameter, with an outline thick, and the faceoff spot is a solid blue circle in diameter.

All of the other faceoff spots and circles are colored red. Each spot consists of a circle in diameter (as measured from the outermost edges) with an outline thick. Within the spot, two red vertical lines are drawn from the left and right inner edges, and the area between these lines is painted red while the rest of the circle is painted white.

=== Goal posts and nets ===
At each end of the ice, there is a goal consisting of a metal goal frame and cloth net in which each team must place the puck to score. According to NHL and IIHF rules, the entire puck must cross the entire goal line in order to be counted as a goal. Under NHL rules, the opening of the goal is wide by tall, and the footprint of the goal is deep.

=== Crease ===
The crease is a special area of the ice in front of each goal that is designed to allow the goaltender to perform without interference.

In North American professional hockey, the goal crease consists of straight lines extending perpendicularly from the goal line outside each goal post, connected by an arc with a radius; red hashmarks are added just inside the straight lines, from the goal line and extending into the crease from either side. The entire area of the crease is typically coloured blue for easier visibility.

=== Goaltender trapezoid (&quot;Martin Brodeur&quot; Rule) ===
During the 2004–05 American Hockey League (AHL) season, an experimental rule was implemented for the first seven weeks of the season, instituting a &quot;goaltender trap zone&quot;, more commonly called &quot;the trapezoid&quot; in reference to its shape. Under the rule, it is prohibited for the goaltender to handle the puck anywhere behind the goal line that is not within the trapezoidal area. If they do so they are assessed a minor penalty for delay of game.

The motivation for the introduction of the trapezoid was to promote game flow and prolonged offensive attacks by making it more difficult for the goaltender to possess and clear the puck. The rule was aimed at reducing the effectiveness of goaltenders with good puck-handling abilities, such as New Jersey Devils goalie Martin Brodeur, for whom the rule is nicknamed.

The area consists of a centred, symmetrical trapezoid. The bases of the trapezoid are formed by the goal line and the end boards. The base on the goal line measures — widened from the original for the 2014-15 NHL season onwards — and the base along the end boards measures , with the depth behind the goal line-to-boards distance specified at .

The seven-week experiment proved so successful that the AHL moved to enforce the rule for the rest of the season, and then the rule was approved by the NHL when play resumed for the 2005–06 season. The ECHL, the only other developmental league in the Professional Hockey Players Association along with the AHL, also approved the rule for 2005–06.

The trapezoid was later adopted by the KHL for the 2019–20 season, and by the IIHF in 2021.

=== Referee&#x27;s crease ===
The &quot;referee&#x27;s crease&quot; is a semicircle in radius in front of the scorekeepers bench. Under USA Hockey rule 601(d)(5), any player entering or remaining in the referee&#x27;s crease while the referee is reporting to or consulting with any game official may be assessed a misconduct penalty. The USA Hockey casebook specifically states that the imposition of such a penalty would be unusual, and the player would typically first be asked to leave the referee&#x27;s crease before the imposition of the penalty. The NHL has a similar rule, also calling for a misconduct penalty. Traditionally, captains and alternate captains are the only players allowed to approach the referee&#x27;s crease.

== Zones ==

The blue lines divide the rink into three zones. The central zone is called the &quot;neutral zone&quot; or simply &quot;centre ice&quot;. The generic term for the outer zones is &quot;end zones&quot;, but they are more commonly referred to by terms relative to each team. The end zone in which a team is trying to score is called the &quot;attacking zone&quot; or &quot;offensive zone&quot;; the end zone in which the team&#x27;s own goal net is located is called the &quot;defending zone&quot; or &quot;defensive zone&quot;.

The blue line is considered part of whichever zone the puck is in. Therefore, if the puck is in the neutral zone, the blue line is part of the neutral zone. It must completely cross the blue line to be considered in the end zone. Once the puck is in the end zone, the blue line becomes part of that end zone. The puck must now completely cross the blue line in the other direction to be considered in the neutral zone again.

== Boards ==
In a hockey rink, the boards are the low wall that form the boundaries of the rink. They are between high. The &quot;side boards&quot; are the boards along the two long sides of the rink. The half boards are the boards halfway between the goal line and blue line. The sections of the rink located behind each goal are called the &quot;end boards&quot;. The boards that are curved (near the ends of the rink) are called the &quot;corner boards&quot;.

<doc id="567928" wikidata="Q1580276" url="?curid=567928" title="The Peanuts">
<text>were a Japanese vocal group consisting of twin sisters Emi (, &quot;Itō Emi&quot;) and Yumi Itō (, &quot;Itō Yumi&quot;). They were born in Nagoya, Japan on April 1, 1941. As identical twins they had voices only slightly apart in timbre, which resulted in their singing together sounding like a solo artist utilizing double tracking or reverb.

==Early life==
Emi and Yumi were born identical twins Hideyo and Tsukiko Ito on Tuesday April 1, 1941 in the city of Tokoname in Aichi Prefecture. Emi was older than her twin sister Yumi.

==Career==
While still in high school, the twins performed at a Nagoya night club as &#x27;The Ito Sisters&#x27;, and were discovered by Watanabe Productions founder Shin Watanabe. They were brought to Tokyo in 1958 where they became the first clients for Watanabe Productions. In 1959, the Peanuts became a hit at the Nichigeki theater. That same year, they released their first recording, &quot;Kawaii Hana&quot; (&quot;Cute Flower&quot;). In their early years they sang Japanese covers of standards, foreign hits, and Japanese folk songs; then they began singing originals, written by their producer, Hiroshi Miyagawa, and such songwriters as Koichi Sugiyama and Rei Nakanishi. They were the first to perform &quot;Koi no Vacance&quot;. 

The twins embarked on a brief acting career appearing as Mothra&#x27;s twin fairies, known as the Shobijin, in the 1961 film &quot;Mothra&quot;, and the 1964 films &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;. In the audio commentary for the DVD of &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot;, it is noted that director Ishirō Honda recalled the Itos&#x27; professionalism. Though not primarily actresses, the twins were surprisingly skilled, learned their lines without trouble, and always worked on time, despite their busy schedule.

Emi had a mole near her left eye. To preserve their image as identical, Yumi would have a mole drawn near her left eye.

===Foreign performances===
They appeared in the United States on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on April 3, 1966, performing &quot;Lover Come Back to Me&quot;.

Unusual for Japanese singers at the time, the duo had success in Germany, as well as in Austria. In 1963 Caterina Valente was in Japan where the duo caught her attention. Valente invited them to Germany. On the occasion of the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Michael Pfleghar produced the opening ceremonies, where both were also invited, and the musical director Heinz Kiessling produced German-language recordings with them, including &quot;Souvenirs from Tokyo&quot;. In 1965, Pfleghar cast them in two other shows &quot;The Smile in the West&quot; and &quot;Schlager-Festspiele&quot;. In total, they released eight singles in the German language between 1964 and 1967. In 1965 &quot;Souvenirs from Tokyo&quot; reached No. 18 on the Austrian charts and spent 2 weeks at No. 40 on the German Billboard charts. In 1967 &quot;Bye, Bye Yokohama&quot; spent 4 weeks on the Germany charts, rising to No. 30. In 1966, the duo also performed at the Olympia in Paris.

==Retirement and death==
The pair retired from performing in April 1975, with a farewell concert tour running from March 21st-April 5th 1975, after Emi married fellow Nabepro star Kenji Sawada. Emi and Kenji eventually divorced in 1987. After retiring from music, Yumi went on to start another career in fashion design, but never married. The duo is remembered most for its versions of European songs and for a handful of Japanese pop songs, such as &quot;Furimukanaide&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Around&quot;). 

Emi Itō died from cancer on June 15, 2012, at the age of 71. Yumi died on May 18, 2016, at the age of 75.

<text>The New American Bible (NAB) is an English translation of the Bible first published in 1970. The 1986 Revised NAB is the basis of the revised Lectionary. In the Catholic Church it is the only translation approved for use during Mass in the United States. The 1970 NAB is also approved for use in the Episcopal Church in the United States.

Stemming originally from the Confraternity Bible, a translation of the Vulgate by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, the project transitioned to translating the original biblical languages in response to Pope Pius XII&#x27;s 1943 encyclical &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu.&quot; The translation was sponsored by the U.S. bishops&#x27; committee on the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine and carried out in stages by members of the Catholic Biblical Association of America (CBA) &quot;from the Original Languages with Critical Use of All the Ancient Sources&quot; (as the title pages state). These efforts eventually became The New American Bible under the liturgical principles and reforms of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965).

== First edition: NAB ==
The first edition of The New American Bible was published on September 30, 1970. Prior to its full publication, several portions of The New American Bible were released; for example, a translation of the Book of Genesis was published in 1952. It was compiled by 51 scholars from 1944 to 1970, overseen by an editorial board headed by Father Stephen J. Hartdegen. It was translated from Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic, rather than from the Latin Vulgate, as previous Catholic translations of the Bible into English had been; it also incorporated then-newly discovered documents such as the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Masada manuscript.

== Second edition: RNAB ==
A revised edition of the New Testament translation of The New American Bible was published in 1986. One of the members of the Bishops&#x27; Ad Hoc Committee was the sexual predator Theodore McCarrick.

== Third edition: RNAB ==
A revised version of the Psalms was published in 1991.

== Fourth edition: NABRE ==

In 1994, work began on a revision of the Old Testament.

In September 2008, the Ad Hoc Committee accepted the final book of the Old Testament, namely, &quot;Jeremiah&quot;. In November of that year, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops approved the complete Old Testament, including footnotes and introductions, but it would not permit it to be published with the &quot;Book of Psalms&quot; of 1991. It accepted the revised Grail Psalter instead, which the Holy See approved and which replaced the revised NAB Psalter for lectionaries for Mass in the United States. The Psalms were again revised in 2008 and sent to the Bishops Committee on Divine Worship but also rejected in favor of the revised Grail Psalter. A final revision of the NAB Psalter was undertaken using suggestions that the Ad Hoc Committee vetted and to more strictly conform to &quot;Liturgiam Authenticam&quot;.

In January 2011, it was announced that the fourth edition of the NAB would be published on March 9 of that year.

== Future editions of the NAB ==

In 2012, the USCCB &quot;announced a plan to revise the New Testament of the New American Bible Revised Edition so a single version can be used for individual prayer, catechesis and liturgy.&quot;

The revision is now underway and, after the necessary approvals from the Bishops and the Holy See, is expected to be completed by 2025.

<text>A string trimmer, also known by the portmanteau strimmer and the trademarks Weedwacker, Weed Eater and Whipper Snipper, is a garden power tool for cutting grass, small weeds, and groundcover. It uses a whirling monofilament line instead of a blade, which protrudes from a rotating spindle at the end of a long shaft topped by a gasoline engine or electric motor.

String trimmers are commonly used for cutting low foliage near obstacles or on steep or irregular terrain. Most professional-grade line trimmers can accept attachment blades to be used as brush cutters for more dense vegetation.

== History ==
The string trimmer was invented in the early 1970s by George Ballas of Houston, Texas, who conceived the idea while watching the revolving action of the cleaning brushes in an automatic car wash. His first trimmer was made by attaching pieces of heavy duty fishing line to a tin can bolted to an edger. Ballas developed this into what he called the &quot;Weed Eater&quot;, since it chewed up the grass and weeds around trees.

The word &quot;strimmer&quot; is correctly a trade name for a particular make of string trimmer, but it is often used as a generic for any string trimmer. From it has been backformed the colloquial verb &quot;to &quot;.

== Terminology by country ==
The terminology used to refer to string trimmers varies by country and sometimes state:

* South Africa: Line trimmer or brushcutter 
* Australia: Whipper snippers 
* UK / Ireland: Strimmer, grass trimmer or brushcutter 

== Design ==
A string trimmer works on the principle that a line spun fast enough on its center stiffens by centrifugal force; the faster the hub turns, the more rigid the line. Even round-section nylon line is able to cut grass and slight, woody plants quite well. Some monofilament lines designed for more powerful cutters have an extruded shape, like a star, that helps the line slash the material being cut; the line is thus able to cut quite large woody plants (small shrubs) or at least girdle them effectively. These lines make solid disks less necessary for tough jobs.

The line is hand-wound onto a reel before the job is started, leaving both ends extending from the reel housing. The motor turns the reel and the line extends horizontally while the operator swings the trimmer about where the plants are to be trimmed. The operator controls the height at which cutting takes place and can trim down to ground level quite easily.
As the line is worn—or breaks off—a bump feed string trimmer, the operator knocks the reel on the ground so a release mechanism allows some of the line in the reel to replace the spent portion. Newer models &quot;auto-feed&quot;, where a small cutter ensures the exposed length does not exceed what can be swung effectively. Newly extended line operates more effectively because of its heavier weight and surface effects. The speed of the spinning hub is controlled by a trigger-activated throttle on the handle.

A fixed-line string trimmer has a trimmer head that takes pre-cut line inserts. There is no wound spool of line in the trimmer head; the user instead feeds the pre-cut line in to the appropriate slots, making the trimmer easier to feed line into and troubleshoot than a bump feed system.

For vertical cutting the whole machine can be tilted or some trimmers allow the head to be adjusted at different angles.

String trimmers powered by an internal combustion engine have the engine on the opposite end of the shaft from the cutting head, while electric string trimmers typically have an electric motor in the cutting head, but there are other arrangements, such as where the trimmer is connected to heavy machinery and powered by a hydraulic motor.

The head contains a safety shield on the user side and a rotating hub which may also be called a head or spool. Disadvantages of a gasoline-powered string trimmer include its greater weight, the need to refuel, and the significant vibration that carries throughout the device, both of which interfere with its maneuverability and contribute to muscle fatigue. Advantages include complete mobility and higher maximum power.

Large trimmers, used for cutting thick roadside grass and weeds in large areas, are both heavier and more powerful. Some are fitted with a harness to spread weight onto the shoulders. Often referred to as brush cutters, these often mount straight or circular metal blades instead of monofilament line.

== Accessories ==

Many string trimmers allow the hub, the head or the lower part of the shaft to be replaced with accessories. Common accessories include:
* metal or plastic blades
* a small chainsaw
* a toothed hedge trimmer
* a cultivator

Quick-release shafts are offered on many newer models which do not require any tools to switch in accessories.

== Power and emissions ==
Gasoline-engine powered trimmers usually have a minimum of displacement motors. At this size they can easily turn line and some have nylon blades as accessories to the line-reel. A engine can swing a line and often has metal-blade accessories. Most trimmers use single-cylinder engines (particularly two-stroke) and require gasoline mixed with oil. Due to pollution laws four stroke engines are becoming more popular, particularly in the commercial market. Manufacturers include Honda, MTD and Craftsman. Companies such as John Deere carry low-emission two-stroke engine trimmers. Stihl manufactures a hybrid four stroke engine trimmer that still requires oil to be pre-mixed into the fuel.

Battery-powered string trimmers offer cleaner alternatives to consumers by producing zero emissions, being more efficient, and eliminating risks of spilled gasoline. Gas-powered string trimmers are not regulated to have emission-capturing technology.

Electric string trimmers have the advantage of being very light, easy to maneuver and easy-to-operate. However, both the power cord and total cord length limit them. Typically less powerful and robust than gasoline-powered units, they are normally are limited to maximum diameter nylon because of their lower power output (400 to about 1200 watts). Recharge time for a battery model using small or large sealed lead acid, nickel metal hydride, or lithium-ion batteries is typically several hours; some models offer a quick-charge option of as little as half an hour, or a removable battery pack.

Propane-powered string trimmers were also manufactured by Lehr.

== Plastic pollution ==
&quot;Earth Island Journal&quot; criticised string trimmers as a source of plastic pollution due to the string being shredded while in use.

== Safety concerns ==
String trimmers can send debris flying randomly at high speed. It is typical for the user to wear either safety glasses or a suitable visor to protect their eyes, but passersby are still at risk. The debris can even damage cars and buildings, with a particularly high risk of broken glass.

Chain-link flail rotors, and any other trimmer head with linked metal parts, were prohibited from sale in the EU after a fatal accident in 2010.

<doc id="567934" wikidata="Q6611749" url="?curid=567934" title="List of colonial governors of New Hampshire">
<text>The territory of the present United States state of New Hampshire has a colonial history dating back to the 1620s. This history is significantly bound to that of the neighboring Massachusetts, whose colonial precursors either claimed the New Hampshire territory, or shared governors with it. First settled in the 1620s under a land grant to John Mason, the colony consisted of a small number of settlements near the seacoast before growing further inland in the 18th century. Mason died in 1635, and the colonists appropriated a number of his holdings. Thomas Roberts served as the last Colonial Governor of the Dover Colony before it became part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1641 the New Hampshire colonists agreed to be ruled by Massachusetts Bay Colony, which also claimed the territory. Massachusetts governed the New Hampshire settlements until 1680, when it became the royally chartered Province of New Hampshire. In 1686 the territory became part of the Dominion of New England, which was effectively disbanded in 1689 following the 1688 Glorious Revolution in England. After an interregnum under &quot;de facto&quot; rule from Massachusetts, Samuel Allen, who had acquired the Mason land claims, became governor. From 1699 to 1741 the governorships of New Hampshire and the Province of Massachusetts Bay were shared.

Boundary disputes between the two colonies prompted King George II to appoint separate governors in 1741, commissioning Portsmouth native Benning Wentworth as governor. In 1775, with the advent of the American Revolutionary War, the province&#x27;s last royal governor, John Wentworth, fled the colony. Under a state constitution drafted in early 1776, Meshech Weare was chosen the first President of the independent state of New Hampshire.

==Lower plantation governors, 1630–1641==
Permanent English settlement began after land grants were issued in 1622 to John Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges for the territory between the Merrimack and Sagadahoc (Kennebec) rivers, roughly encompassing present-day New Hampshire and western Maine. Settlers, whose early leaders included David Thomson, Edward Hilton, and Thomas Hilton, began settlements on the New Hampshire coast and islands as early as 1623, that eventually expanded along the shores of the Piscataqua River and the Great Bay. Mason and Gorges, neither of whom ever came to New England, divided their claims along the Piscataqua River in 1629. Mason took the territory between the Piscataqua and Merrimack, and called it &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, after the English county of Hampshire.

Conflicts between holders of grants issued by Mason and Gorges concerning their boundaries eventually led to a need for more active management. Captain Walter Neale was appointed in 1630 by the proprietors of the Strawbery Banke (or &quot;Lower&quot;) plantation (present-day Portsmouth and nearby communities) as agent and governor of that territory. Neale returned to England in 1633, and John Mason appointed Francis Williams to govern the lower plantation in 1634. Early New Hampshire historian Jeremy Belknap called Williams the governor of the lower plantation, and claimed that he served until the New Hampshire plantations came under Massachusetts rule, at which time he became a magistrate in the Massachusetts government. However, Belknap&#x27;s claim is disputed by historian Charles Tuttle, who observes that there are no records prior to 1640 in which Mason or Gorges refer to Williams as governor. Tuttle claims that Mason appointed Henry Josselyn to succeed Neale, and that Mason&#x27;s widow appointed Francis Norton, a Massachusetts resident, in 1638 to oversee the estate&#x27;s interests, although when his stewardship ends is unclear.
==Upper plantation governors, 1631–1641==
The first governor of the &quot;Dover&quot; or &quot;Upper Plantation&quot; was Captain Thomas Wiggin. The exact date of his appointment is uncertain. He was known to be in the area in 1629 and 1631, when Belknap suggests he was appointed governor by Mason and Gorges. He received a more definite appointment for administration of this plantation by 1633, when he was commissioned by Lords Brooke and Say and Sele, who had purchased land in the area from Mason.

The territory then comprised modern-day Dover, Durham, and Stratham. Wiggin is styled in some histories as a governor, and was referred to in contemporary documentation as &quot;[having the] power of Governor hereabouts&quot;. However, his powers appear to have been limited to transacting the proprietors&#x27; business, including the granting of land, and the proprietors themselves did not possess the power of government. Wiggin and Walter Neale apparently disagreed on territorial boundaries of their respective domains, and supposedly almost came to blows, although whether this occurred in 1632 or 1633 is unclear. In the fall of 1637 the upper communities banded together and formed a government headed by the Rev. George Burdett.
==Massachusetts governors, 1641–1680==

Mason&#x27;s widow decided in 1638 to abandon financial support of the colony. After shifting for themselves for a time (during which much of the Mason property was appropriated by the colonists), the plantations of New Hampshire agreed in 1641 to join with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The towns of New Hampshire sent representatives to the Massachusetts legislature, and were governed by its governors, who were elected annually.
==First provincial period, 1680–1689==
In 1679, King Charles II issued a royal charter for the Province of New Hampshire. John Cutt was appointed president, and took office on January 21, 1680. He was succeeded after his death by his deputy, Richard Waldron. At the urging of the heirs of John Mason, who were trying to recover their inherited claims, Charles issued a new charter in 1682, with Edward Cranfield as lieutenant governor. This government survived until the Dominion of New England was introduced in 1686, although Cranfield departed the province in 1685, replaced in the interim by his deputy, Walter Barefoote.

==Dominion of New England and interregnum==

From 1686 to 1689 the province was joined into the Dominion of New England. After the dominion collapsed in April 1689, the New Hampshire communities were left without government. Although they briefly established a government in January 1690, they petitioned Massachusetts for protection, and Massachusetts Governor Simon Bradstreet &quot;de facto&quot; governed the colony from March 1690.

==Second provincial period, 1692–1775==
From 1692 to 1699, Samuel Allen was the governor of New Hampshire. For most of his tenure, he remained in London, pursuing legal actions relevant to proprietary land claims he had purchased from the Masons, but he came to the colony briefly before the arrival of his replacement as governor, the Earl of Bellomont. From 1699 to 1741, the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay was also commissioned as governor of New Hampshire. The lieutenant governor controlled the province, acting as governor unless the commissioned governor was present. In 1741 the governance of Massachusetts and New Hampshire was divided. As a result, during the tenures of the last two governors, Benning and John Wentworth, the role of the lieutenant governor diminished. John Temple, the last lieutenant governor, apparently held the office in title only.

One commission was issued but not used. On February 8, 1715/6, Colonel Elizeus Burges was appointed to succeed Joseph Dudley as governor of both Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Before coming to North America, Burges was bribed by Massachusetts operatives to resign his commissions; Colonel Samuel Shute was then chosen to replace Dudley.

The column labeled &quot;Commissioned&quot; indicates the date when the governor&#x27;s commission was issued in London, and does not represent when the governor arrived in the province to formally take up the government. The column labeled &quot;Left office&quot; shows the date when the individual was replaced by the arrival of his successor, with a few exceptions. Two governors, Bellomont and William Burnet, died while still holding their commissions (although neither was in the province at the time). Governor Shute effectively abandoned his office by abruptly departing Boston for England on January 1, 1723. His administration effectively came to an end then, but he was technically the office holder until Burnet was commissioned in 1728. The last governor, John Wentworth, fled the province in August 1775, after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War brought threats to his rule and family. The province was thereafter governed provisionally until January 1776, when Meshech Weare was elected the independent state&#x27;s first president under a new state constitution.

<text>The Schulich School of Law is the law school of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Founded in 1883 as Dalhousie Law School, it is the oldest university-based common law school in Canada. It adopted its current name in October 2009 after receiving a $20-million endowment from Canadian businessman and philanthropist Seymour Schulich.

Today, the Schulich School of Law is the largest law school in Atlantic Canada, with 500 students enrolled each year (170 in first-year) and a faculty of Rhodes, Fulbright, and Trudeau scholars.

==History==
The Dalhousie Law School was founded by an 1883 endowment by George Munro for a chair in constitutional and international law at Dalhousie University. Munro proposed Richard Chapman Weldon to lead the new faculty, at a salary of $2,000. Chapman was Professor of Mathematics at Mount Allison, and had been educated at Yale and Heidelberg.

Though Munro&#x27;s endowment would not fund further professorships, it would allow a group of lawyers and judges to receive a $100 annual stipend for lecturing to Dalhousie&#x27;s students. Further donations from other benefactors allowed the university to secure 2,800 books for its library.

The school was initially housed in two large ground-floor rooms of the Halifax Academy. Two years later, Weldon and a friend, Benjamin Russell, personally bought the late Sir Brenton Halliburton&#x27;s house on Morris Street, which housed the law school until 1887.

== Ethos ==
Weldon emphasised the responsibility that lawyers had to contribute to public service: 

Weldon aspired to treat the study of law as a full-time, liberal education. It was not, as Osgoode Hall was, an outpost for the province&#x27;s professional law society where law was seen as &quot;merely a technical craft&quot;, nor did it follow the expectation of legal training that was dominant in French Canadian universities. Thus, the founding of the Dalhousie Law School was experimental and innovative in Canadian law. Indeed, the establishment of a university common law school was so radical – and its subsequent influence so great – that legal historians cite Dalhousie Law School as the basis for law school today.

In his &quot;Story of Legal Education in British Columbia&quot;, a book that chronicles the establishment of the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law sixty-two years after Dalhousie Law School first opened, W. Wesley Pue writes:
In discussing the motivations that led to the establishment of a full-time common law school, Weldon described the &quot;&#x27;legitimate ambition&#x27; of &#x27;generous spirits who wish their country well&#x27; to build a law school &#x27;that shall influence the intellectual life of Canada as Harvard and Yale have influenced the intellectual life of New England.&#x27;&quot;

Based on Weldon&#x27;s comments in his inaugural address at the opening of the law school, it&#x27;s unsurprising that the Schulich School of Law has shared a storied connection with Harvard University. Although Dalhousie was influenced early on by the Harvard Law School, it placed a decidedly unique emphasis on the subjects of public law, constitutional history, and international law, fields that were notably absent from Harvard&#x27;s curriculum in the 1880s.

==Reputation==

The school was ranked in the top three Canadian law schools in &quot;Corporate Knights&quot;&#x27; 2011 Knight Schools Survey. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; 2013 ranking of Canadian common law schools placed the school sixth out of 16. The Schulich School of Law was also the first Canadian law school awarded the Emil Gumpuert Award by the American College of Trial Lawyers for trial advocacy training.

==Location==
In 1966, the school moved to its current home, the Weldon Law Building, on Dalhousie&#x27;s Studley Campus. On August 16, 1985, a lightning strike caused a short in Weldon&#x27;s electrical system, which started a fire that destroyed most of the Sir James Dunn Law Library. The library reopened four years later in 1989.

Refurbishments to the Weldon Law Building took place in 2004 with the addition of the James and Barbara Palmer Wing and in 2016 with the Facade Renewal Project. In phases one and two of the Facade Renewal Project, windows were replaced, walls were insulated, and stonework was reinforced on the third and fourth floors of the building. In phases three and four, construction was focused on the building&#x27;s first and second floors. Here, crews removed existing stonework, installed an accessible ramp to the school&#x27;s entrance on University Avenue, and redid the school&#x27;s front entrance.

Inside the building, the centre staircase that existed between the first and second floor has been removed to make way for the creation of modern administrative office space on the second floor to provide a new and improved area for the administrative staff. The faculty&#x27;s mosaic laid initially at the top of the stairs on the second floor and which weighs close to 2,500 lbs. was preserved and laid outside of the new administrative space.

==Programs==

In January 2011, the Senate voted to change Dalhousie&#x27;s law degree designation from a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) to a Juris Doctor (JD). Students attending the Schulich School of Law today can undertake a regular JD degree or concentrate their JD in one of four specific areas: health law, business law/corporate law, marine and environmental law, and law and technology.

The school also offers a variety of combined-degree programs for undergraduate students:
* JD/MBA (Master of Business Administration)
* JD/MPA (Master of Public Administration)
* JD/MI (Master of Information)
* JD/MHA (Master of Health Administration)
* JD/MJ (Master of Journalism). The JD/MJ combination is the first of its kind in Canada.
The Schulich School of Law also gives 20 to 30 aspiring professors and jurists who wish to enhance their knowledge of law and specialize in a particular areas/areas of law the option to pursue a postgraduate degree at the school:
* LLM (Master of Laws)
* PhD (Doctor of Philosophy)
* MEC (Master of Electronic Commerce)
* Interdisciplinary PhD program
As an accredited law school in Canada, graduates are eligible to proceed to bar admission and articling programs throughout the country. Further information on bar admission for accredited Canadian law school graduates and the National Committee on Accreditation (NCA) for foreign-trained law graduates is available at the Federation of Law Societies of Canada website.

==Admissions==
At the Schulich School of Law, GPAs are weighed at 60 per cent and LSAT scores at 40 per cent. In 2016, 170 students were admitted from a pool of over 1,300 applicants, of which 55 per cent were women and 45 per cent men. The average age of applicants was 25. The Schulich School of Law&#x27;s two application deadlines are November 30 and February 28.

== Indigenous Blacks &amp; Mi&#x27;kmaq Initiative ==
The Indigenous Blacks &amp; Mi&#x27;kmaq (IB&amp;M) Initiative at the Schulich School of Law was established in 1989 to increase the representation of these community members in the legal profession. The initiative develops scholarships in the areas of Aboriginal and African Canadian legal perspectives, promotes the hiring and retention of graduates, and provides eligible students with financial and other types of support.

== Dalhousie Legal Aid Service ==
The Dalhousie Legal Aid Service was founded in 1970. It provides legal services to the Halifax area and brings together third-year law students, practising lawyers, and community actors. It is the oldest clinical law program in Canada and the only community law clinic in Nova Scotia. Students can receive academic credit and gain practical legal experience through the Legal Aid Service, which emphasizes the development of professional skills and the refinement of substantive and procedural knowledge in a real-life context.

==Student life==
===Domus Legis Society===
Law student life at Dalhousie is known for its collegiality and tradition. The student-run &quot;Domus Legis&quot; Society (better known as &quot;Domus Legis&quot;) was founded in 1965 and is Canada&#x27;s oldest social society for law students. (&quot;Domus Legis&quot; is derived from Latin and means &quot;House of Law.&quot;) It was created by Dalhousie law students &quot;to promote good fellowship among congenial men and women at the Faculty of Law of Dalhousie University; to encourage a high standard of professional work; and to assist by every honourable means the advancement of its members.&quot;

&quot;Domus Legis&quot; functions independently from the university administration and receives support from alumni and Canadian law firms. The society adheres to a constitution and is run by an annually elected executive of students from the Faculty of Law. Despite its independence, &quot;Domus Legis&quot; has close customary ties to faculty, alumni, visiting justices, and the Dean, who is given honorary designation as Member #1.

Over the years, traditions have grown to include the customary signing of the &quot;Domus Legis&quot; Society&#x27;s walls by law graduates and visiting dignitaries. The last of this tradition is proudly displayed in the Weldon Law building student lounge with the signature &quot;Homeless Class of 2005.&quot; The original building that housed the society was located at 1255 Seymour St., which was demolished in January 2004.

Despite their headquarters&#x27; demolition, &quot;Domus Legis&#x27;s&quot; traditions live on in the weekly Domus Night, which takes place every Thursday, and the annual Halloween party, which attracts law students and members of other faculties. Efforts to acquire a new home for &quot;Domus Legis&quot; continue along with alumni support. &quot;Domus Legis&quot; membership is open to all Schulich School of Law students.

===Dalhousie Law Students&#x27; Society===

The Dalhousie Law Students&#x27; Society (LSS) is the elected student government of the Schulich School of Law. It is composed of seven executive members, with representatives from each section in first year, three representatives each from second and third year, a Black students&#x27; representative, an Aboriginal students&#x27; representative, a chair, and a secretary. The society represents the student voice in all aspects of the law school, including social, financial, athletic, and academic.

===&quot;Dalhousie Journal of Legal Studies&quot;===

The &quot;Dalhousie Journal of Legal Studies (DJLS)&quot; is a non-profit academic law journal that publishes work from current law students and recent alumni. Established in 1991, the &quot;DJLS&quot; promotes reflection and debate on contemporary legal issues. As one of the only publications of its kind in Canada, the journal serves as a unique vehicle for law students to publish their work. The &quot;DJLS&quot; is published once per academic year and maintains a broad subscription base that includes law firms, law school libraries, corporations, government departments, alumni, and legal professionals from around the globe. It is also indexed in the HeinOnline database.

An entirely student-run publication, the &quot;DJLS&quot; is managed by an editorial board. More than 70 student volunteers assist in its production and publication. It is distinct from the &quot;Dalhousie Law Journal&quot;, a peer-reviewed publication produced by Schulich School of Law faculty members.

===&quot;The Weldon Times&quot;===

&quot;The Weldon Times&quot; is a law student-run newspaper established in 1972. They publish articles focused on life in the law school, community, and legal profession.

The Weldon Times maintains a print and digital distribution of issues, which are now released as quarterly magazines. Digital copies of the latest issues can be found at www.TheWeldonTimes.com

==Notable alumni==
The Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University has produced a number of accomplished alumni over the course of its history, including over 300 judicial appointments to every level of court in every province of Canada.

<text>The Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (after Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz) is a fluid instability that occurs when there is velocity shear in a single continuous fluid or a velocity difference across the interface between two fluids. Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are visible in the atmospheres of planets and moons, such as in cloud formations on Earth or the Red Spot on Jupiter, and the atmospheres of the Sun and other stars.
==Theory overview and mathematical concepts==


Fluid dynamics predicts the onset of instability and transition to turbulent flow within fluids of different densities moving at different speeds. If surface tension is ignored, two fluids in parallel motion with different velocities and densities yield an interface that is unstable to short-wavelength perturbations for all speeds. However, surface tension is able to stabilize the short wavelength instability up to a threshold velocity.

If the density and velocity vary continuously in space (with the lighter layers uppermost, so that the fluid is RT-stable), the dynamics of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is described by the Taylor–Goldstein equation: 
formula_1 where formula_2 denotes the Brunt–Väisälä frequency, U is the horizontal parallel velocity, k is the wave number, c is the eigenvalue parameter of the problem, formula_3 is complex amplitude of the stream function. Its onset is given by the Richardson number formula_4. Typically the layer is unstable for formula_5. These effects are common in cloud layers. The study of this instability is applicable in plasma physics, for example in inertial confinement fusion and the plasma–beryllium interface. In situations where there is a state of static stability (where there is a continuous density gradient), the Rayleigh–Taylor instability is often insignificant compared to the magnitude of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability.

Numerically, the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability is simulated in a temporal or a spatial approach. In the temporal approach, the flow is considered in a periodic (cyclic) box &quot;moving&quot; at mean speed (absolute instability). In the spatial approach, simulations mimic a lab experiment with natural inlet and outlet conditions (convective instability).
== Discovery and history==
The existence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability was first discovered by German physiologist and physicist Hermann von Helmholtz in 1868. Helmholtz identified that &quot;every perfect geometrically sharp edge by which a fluid flows must tear it asunder and establish a surface of separation&quot;. Following that work, in 1871, collaborator William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), developed a mathematical solution of linear instability whilst attempting to model the formation of ocean wind waves.

Throughout the early 20th Century, the ideas of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities were applied to a range of stratified fluid applications. In the early 1920s, Lewis Fry Richardson developed the concept that such shear instability would only form where shear overcame static stability due to stratification, encapsulated in the Richardson Number. 

Geophysical observations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability were made through the late 1960s/early 1970s, for clouds, and later the ocean.

<text>Viktor Vasilyevich Grishin (; – 25 May 1992) was a Soviet politician. He was a candidate (1961–1971) and full member (1971–1986) of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

== Biography ==
Grishin was born in Serpukhov, in the Moscow Governorate of the Russian Empire. In his early years, he worked on the Moscovy railroad, as a spike driver who retrofitted its railway system. He served in the Red Army from 1938 until 1940. In 1941, he was a Communist party functionary. He eventually rose to become leader of the Communist party in the city of Moscow from 1967 until 1985. He was renowned for his hardline stance.

During the final months of Konstantin Chernenko&#x27;s life, Grishin had been considered as a possible contender to succeed Chernenko as General Secretary, and as a possible alternative to Mikhail Gorbachev. In an attempt to stress his closeness to Chernenko, he dragged the terminally ill Soviet leader out to vote in early 1985. This action by Grishin backfired and was almost universally viewed as a cruel act. After Chernenko&#x27;s death in March 1985, he declined to put himself forward as a candidate for succession and instead offered his support, albeit lukewarm, to Gorbachev. Gorbachev was subsequently unanimously elected as the General Secretary. 

In late-December 1985, Grishin was replaced by Boris Yeltsin as the First Secretary of the Moscow party committee. On 18 February 1986, Grishin lost his position as a member of the Politburo.

In a 1991 interview with the conservative Russian newspaper Molodaya Gvardiya, he claimed the only reason he lost was because &quot;younger Party leaders, such as Yegor Ligachev, supported Gorbachev because they feared that if I had become Party boss, they would lose their posts.&quot;

== Death ==
On 25 May 1992, Grishin died at the age of 77. He suffered a heart attack at a welfare office in Moscow, where he went to register an increase in his state pension.

<text>The penalty box or sin bin (sometimes called the bad box, or simply bin or box) is the area in ice hockey, rugby union, rugby league, roller derby and some other sports where a player sits to serve the time of a given penalty, for an offence not severe enough to merit outright expulsion from the contest. Teams are generally not allowed to replace players who have been sent to the penalty box.

==Ice hockey==

Ice hockey has popularized the term &quot;penalty box&quot;. In most cases it is a small isolated bench surrounded by walls on all four sides, with the side facing the ice having the access door. There are typically two penalty boxes: one for each team. In ice hockey a period in the box occurs for all penalties unless circumstances call for an ejection or a penalty shot. If three or more players are serving penalties at once, the team will continue playing with three on the ice but will not be allowed to use the players in the box until their penalties expire.

Most leagues specify that a team cannot replace on the ice a member serving a minor (2-minute) penalty. This results in situations such as the power play, in which the opposing team outnumbers the penalized team, and (in the event of coincidental minor penalties) situations in which both teams must skate with one fewer player on the ice.

If a team scores a goal while one or more of the opposing team is serving a non-coincidental minor penalty, the penalty with the least time remaining is cancelled, and the player serving that penalty may return to the ice. In the case of a double-minor (4-minute) penalty, the penalty is treated as two consecutive 2-minute penalties. If the opposing team scores, only the penalty currently being served is cancelled (e.g. a goal with a double-minor penalty clock at 3:45 is reset to 2:00); if at least one penalty interval remains, the penalty clock is reset to reflect this (two minutes if one interval remains, four minutes if two intervals remain) and the player must remain in the box; if less than two minutes remain, the remaining penalty is cancelled, and the player is released. A major (5-minute) or misconduct (10-minute) penalty must be served in full, regardless of the number of goals scored by the opposition. To keep play fair, coincidental minor penalties (&quot;matching minor&quot; penalties assessed to both teams simultaneously) are also served in full regardless of scoring. Goaltenders never go to the penalty box even though they are assessed penalty minutes (but they can be ejected and replaced with a substitute). Any penalties enforced against goaltenders or the bench are served by a teammate, with many leagues requiring that teammate to have been on the ice when the penalty occurred.

==Rugby league==
In rugby league, penalties involving violent play, dangerous play, professional fouls or repetitive commission of a specific offence can result in a &quot;sin binning&quot;, where the offending player must spend 10 minutes off the field. In Australian rugby league, the referee will raise both hands and spread his digits to indicate &quot;10 minutes&quot;; elsewhere, the yellow card is used.

Often, if a team is committing one offence repeatedly, the referee will warn the captain that the next time they commit that offence, the player responsible will be sent to the bin. In the Super League and other UK based competitions, the referee will face the offending team and circle one arm towards them to signal a team warning; this saves time and also allows for fans to see that the next player responsible for a penalty will be sent to the sin bin indefinitely (if there has not been a sufficient change in attitude from the team). For the most serious offences and/or repeated misconduct, the referee may send off players, who take no further part in the game and leave their team a player short. Referees also have the power to send team officials to the stands.

In 1981 Australia&#x27;s New South Wales Rugby Football League introduced the use of the sin bin and that year Newtown Jets hooker Barry Jensen became the first player sent to it. 
In the National Rugby League, there is no &quot;physical&quot; sin bin. Players must serve their punishment in the dressing room; remaining on the sideline or in the stands is not permitted. However, in the Super League and other UK based competitions, a player sent to the sin bin will usually sit on the bench and will wear a &#x27;bib&#x27;; however, they do have the option of going back into the dressing room if they please.

==Rugby union==
Use of the sin bin was introduced to rugby union in 2001.
A sin-binned or sent-off player may be replaced if he plays in the front row of the scrum (prop or hooker) and the team has a substitute available who is capable of filling that player&#x27;s position. This allows contested scrums to continue during the player&#x27;s suspension. In this instance, the team must remove one player from another position for the duration of the suspension. The referee usually signals such infringements by displaying a yellow card.

In rugby union sevens, the sending-off period is 2 minutes, which despite being eight minutes shorter, is actually a more severe penalty for two reasons: first, a normal sevens match lasts only 14 minutes instead of the 80 used in 15-man union or 13-man league, meaning that the penalty lasts one seventh (14.3%) as opposed to one eighth (12.5%) of the match, and second, during this time, the offender&#x27;s team must play without one seventh of their team; this opens up more space than losing one thirteenth or one fifteenth of the side.

==Other sports==
The following sports use penalty boxes (by that or another name) in some form:

*Association football (low-level games only)
*Bandy
*Field hockey: In outdoor field hockey, there is no designated area and players must serve their suspensions in the spectator area. In indoor field hockey suspensions are served in the &quot;suspension area&quot;.
*Floorball: Usually referred to as a &quot;penalty bench&quot;.
*Handball: There is no designated area and players usually serve suspensions on their team&#x27;s bench.
*International Rules football
*Lacrosse
*Ringette
*Roller derby
*Water polo
The hybrid sport of International Rules football presents a slight anomaly since penalty boxes are native to &quot;neither&quot; of the sports from which International Rules was conceived, namely Gaelic football and Australian rules football (although the Gaelic Athletic Association did experiment with the idea, before moving on to another experimental format, which requires a player given a black card to be substituted).

Proposals to introduce penalty boxes in association football have been discussed by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). In 2017 IFAB approved temporary dismissals for cautionable offences; however, this is only permitted for youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football. Competitions&#x27; use of this system—rather than &quot;normal&quot; yellow cards—is optional, and there are variations in how it can be implemented. For 90-minute games, the length of the temporary dismissal is 10 minutes.

Some indoor soccer leagues and competitions, which often use the playing area layout, boards and benches of ice hockey, already use them. In small sided football (i.e., 5-, 6- and 7-a-side), &quot;timed suspensions&quot; are used, and indicated by a blue card, in addition to the traditional yellow for a caution. Periods of suspensions vary depending on the match length (e.g., a 25-minute-half match has a suspension of 5 minutes) and are defined in the competition&#x27;s rules.

In professional wrestling the promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling has used a penalty box in the King of the Mountain match, where instead of retrieving an object hanging above the ring, the winner is the first person to use a ladder to &quot;hang&quot; a championship belt above the ring — after having scored a pinfall or submission (pinfalls count anywhere) to earn the right to try. A wrestler who has been pinned or forced to submit must spend two minutes in a penalty box.

<doc id="567956" wikidata="Q184392" url="?curid=567956" title="Foix">
<text>Foix ( , ; ; ) is a commune, the former capital of the County of Foix. It is the capital of the department of Ariège as it is the seat of the prefecture of that department. Foix is located in the Occitanie region of southwestern France. It is the second least populous French departmental capital, the least populous being Privas. Foix lies south of Toulouse, close to the borders with Spain and Andorra.

It is only the second biggest town in Ariège, the biggest being Pamiers, which is one of the two sub-prefectures, the other being St Girons. Foix is twinned with the English cathedral city of Ripon, with the Spanish towns of Sarroca de Lleida, Lleida and the Andorran capital Andorra la Vella.

==History==

The Romans built a fort on the steep rock from which Foix castle now dominates the town. The town of Foix probably owes its origin to an oratory founded by Charlemagne, which afterwards became the Abbey of Saint Volusianus in 849.

The founding, in 849, of the Abbey Saint-Volusien allowed the development of urban living in the tenth century to the twelfth century. The city reached its peak in the fourteenth century.

The castle, whose foundations date back to the early tenth century, was a strong fortress that withstood the repeated attacks of Simon de Montfort IV between 1211 and 1217, during the Albigensian Crusade. In 1272, when the Count of Foix refused to recognize the sovereignty of the king of France, Philip the Bold personally took the leadership of an expedition against the city, and subsequently the count surrendered. In 1290, at a meeting of the Béarn region and the county of Foix, the city was practically abandoned by the Counts. Gaston Phoebus was the last to have lived in the castle, and by the sixteenth century the castle had lost its military purpose. The castle was then used as a prison until 1864.

In 1536 the first Reformation preaching in Foix began, and in 1579 the church of Montgauzy was destroyed. The same fate awaited the abbey and its church in 1581. The following year, Foix was retaken by Catholics, and in 1589 the Count of Foix, Henry of Navarre, was crowned King of France and became Henry IV.

==Geography==
Foix is situated at the confluence of the Ariège and Arget rivers in the foothills of the Pyrenees. It can be accessed by car from the Route Nationale 20 (N20). Trains run north from Foix station to Toulouse and south to l&#x27;Hospitalet station that serves Andorra, terminating at Letour de Carol station, near the Spanish border, where there is a direct connection with the Barcelona regional train service and the scenic Ligne de Cerdagne (&quot;Petit train jaune&quot;, or Little Yellow Train). There is also a direct sleeper train service from Foix station to Paris.

==Politics and administration==
===Municipal===
In accordance with the General Code of Territorial Collectives - Article L2121-2, the number of council members is fixed in relation to the size of the population. For Foix, this is twenty nine.

The last municipal elections were held in March 2020, when retired teacher, Norbert Meler, was re-elected Mayor.

===Administration and electoral relationships===

The town of Foix was the seat of the Commune of Foix, which has now merged with the various other communes to form the commune of the Pays Foix-Varilhes within the Department of Ariège. As such, it hosts several administrative bodies, namely the Education Inspectorate, Departmental Territories Directorate, Departmental Directorate for Social Cohesion and Protection of the Population, the local branches of the Family Allowance Fund (CAF, and of the Primary Health Insurance Fund (CPAM), as well as the local branch of the Agricultural Social Mutual Fund (MSA).

==Population==
==Heraldry==
The coat of arms used by the commune has the blazon &quot;D&#x27;or à trois pals de gueules&quot; (gold with three red bars). This is replicated on the flag, and on the arms of the &quot;département&quot;. It originates from the arms of the Counts of Foix and dates back to medieval times. It resembles the coat of arms of Catalonia and of Aragon, both of which are featured in the coat of arms of Andorra.

In 1958, the post office issued a postage stamp with a face value of 15 f., coloured ultramarine, grey, brown and green representing the Château de Foix, reference YT 11759.

===Markets and fairs===
There are two weekly markets in the town. On Tuesdays, between 7.30 am and 1.30 pm, there is a small market for local food producers at the main covered market, the Halle aux Grains. The main market on Fridays sells local agricultural produce, food, craft and various other products. It occupies the wide central reservation of the main thoroughfare, the Allées de Vilotte, the neighbouring Halle aux Grains, and has a mainly organic produce section a couple of hundred yards away, at the Square of Saint-Volusien, where there is a smaller covered market.

==Places of local interest==
===Botanical Garden===
The botanical garden, &quot;Les Épines de Lespinet&quot;, has a collection of cacti and succulents, as well as citrus trees, banana plants, and Mediterranean vegetation.

===Halle aux Grains===
The Halle aux Grains covered market, dating from 1870, is in the style of Victor Baltard.

===Castle ===
The castle stands on a rocky outcrop that dominates the town. The castle rock is geologically part of Mount Saint Sauveur, to the North West of the town and was separated from it due to erosion by the river Arget. Most of the present building dates from the 12th to 14th centuries. The Arget tower to the North was covered by a slate roof at the end of the nineteenth century, and is certainly the oldest dating to the 11th and 12th centuries.
The middle, square tower, built in the 13th century, was completely renovated in the 14th century. It has beautiful architectural features such as sculpted heads and coats of arms on the keystones.
The round tower is of Gothic architecture with large bays illuminating beautiful hexagonal vaulted halls.

===Saint-Volusien Abbey===

In 1104, the regular canons of St Augustine took possession of an abbey housing the relics of St Volusien. It was then that the construction of a large church with three naves and a transept was undertaken. In the 14th century, the Romanesque apse was replaced by a new polygonal chancel. The building was destroyed during the religious wars and the relics were burned. Reconstruction work was begun in 1609 and completed in 1670. The portal and the base of the walls of the nave are the main remnants of the medieval church.
There is a very fine organ of 40 stops, built by Fermis in 1869 and restored in 2007.

===Old Town===
This still retains its medieval character as reflected in the narrow streets (Rue des Marchands, the Rue des Chapeliers), and some half-timbered houses.

===Chapel and area of Montgauzy===
Nothing remains of the primitive Romanesque church and the 13th century church. The present church dates partly from 1628, and retains the Romanesque layout and a portal that copies the Romanesque style. The history of the chapel of Montgauzy is eclectic. Its foundation commemorates the victory of Charlemagne over the Moors in 778, and the chapel then became a place of pilgrimage. In 1340, the Bishop of Pamiers, Arnaud Villemur, had to intervene against the bad behaviour of some of the increasing numbers of pilgrims (there were reports of noisy evening events). On 4 January 1562 the chapel was one of the many targets of the Reformation, and in 1579 the governor of the castle of Foix demolished it. It was rebuilt in 1628 and pilgrimages recommenced. Following the revolution, having been rebuilt, it was sold in 1791. This, now private, property fell into ruin due to lack of maintenance. It was then purchased by the department in 1840. An École Normale was established in the area and, in 1843, the chapel was once more made fit for worship. It was closed again in 1883, and the furniture was scattered. After repairs in 1943, it was again reopened for worship.

===The Allées de Villote===
The &quot;Villote&quot; (small town), in the Middle Ages, was an area outside the city walls and was built in 1330. Executions sometimes took place there. After the destruction of the city walls, tree planting and urban landscaping works, including a fountain and bandstand, made it a popular venue for promenading by the townspeople. The plane-tree-lined central reservation of the Allées de Villote contains the town war memorial as well as a car park and is currently a main site for festive occasions and for the Friday market. The street is lined by shops, cafés and restaurants and public buildings as well as a monument to the resistance to and deportees of the Second World War Nazi occupation.

<doc id="567957" wikidata="Q3080332" url="?curid=567957" title="John Sheridan (Babylon 5)">
<text>John J. Sheridan is the lead character in the fictional universe of the science-fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, played by Bruce Boxleitner. For most of the series, he is the commander of the Babylon 5 station; during the series&#x27; final season he is the President of the Interstellar Alliance.

==Personality==
John Sheridan is portrayed as an incorruptible, dynamic, idealistic, and charismatic leader who can inspire fierce loyalty in his subordinates. However, Sheridan is shown at times to be reckless and stubborn, and like his second-in-command Susan Ivanova he possesses a fierce temper that can lead to occasional explosive outbursts of anger. Fortunately, he tends to calm quickly and he usually demonstrates a cheerful and upbeat personality. His second wife, Anna Sheridan, was (apparently) killed while exploring a distant planet, and when he takes command of Babylon 5 at the start of Season 2 her death still troubles him.

After Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;return from the dead&quot; in the fourth season, he displays an increasing impatience with accomplishing his goals. This is caused, however, by the fact that during season four, he learns that he has only twenty more years to live. By the end of the series Sheridan has become a galactic president and legend, and overall there is little doubt that he has been a force for good throughout his time in the series.

==Religious references==
Throughout the show numerous references are made concerning Sheridan&#x27;s analogous role in history to that of a messiah. A number of religious phrases are used to refer to Sheridan: messiah, messianic, and The second coming. In Season four episode 17, The Face of the Enemy, when Michael Garibaldi speaks with William Edgars about capturing Sheridan, Garibaldi says &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but I think the last guy got 30 pieces of silver for the same job,&quot; a reference to Judas&#x27; betrayal of Jesus.

When Sheridan falls and is caught by the Vorlon Kosh in the season 2 episode The Fall of Night. Kosh, not wanting to reveal his true form, appears as a different religious figure depending on the onlookers&#x27; home world. Because Sheridan is human, he perceived him as being an angel. says &quot;To his heavenly messengers he will give orders about you, and with their hands, they will catch you.&quot; Which was the devil telling Jesus that if he were to fall, angels would catch him saving him from his death.

Sheridan was also resurrected twice by Lorien. The first time on Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum in season four: Whatever Happened To Mr. Garibaldi, right after Sheridan asks Lorien &quot;If I fall how will I know you&#x27;ll catch me?&quot;, and the second was on Babylon 5 during a fight with Ulkesh in episode Falling Toward Apotheosis further solidifying his parallels with a legendary messiah.

==Character history==
===Early life and career===
John Sheridan was born on Earth to an Earth Alliance diplomat. John Sheridan is a descendant of the famous American Civil War general Philip Sheridan. In the original broadcast of &quot;And Now For a Word&quot; Sheridan&#x27;s middle name is given as David (his father&#x27;s name, the name he eventually gives his son, and also the middle name of Jeffrey Sinclair). In later episodes, he is referred to as &quot;John J. Sheridan&quot;. On the Babylon 5 season 2 DVD release of &quot;And Now For a Word&quot;, Sheridan&#x27;s name is corrected to &quot;John J. Sheridan&quot;. As a young man he joined Earthforce, was married briefly to Elizabeth Lochley, and by 2245 had risen to the rank of lieutenant commander.

In the TV movie &quot;In the Beginning&quot; he was offered the first officer position aboard the Earthforce warship &quot;Prometheus&quot;, but declined the position due to its commanding officer&#x27;s history of mishandling first contact situations and reputation as a loose cannon. The &quot;Prometheus&quot; later was the ship that precipitated the Earth-Minbari War when it fired on a Minbari warcruiser during Earth&#x27;s disastrous first contact with that race. During the war Sheridan served as first officer aboard the &quot;Hyperion-Class&quot; warship EAS &quot;Lexington&quot;. When the ship&#x27;s captain was killed in an ambush by the Minbari flagship &quot;Black Star&quot;, Sheridan took command. With the &quot;Lexington&quot; crippled and unable to fight, Sheridan mined several nearby asteroids with nuclear weapons and lured the &quot;Black Star&quot; back towards his ship with a distress signal. He then detonated the nuclear mines, destroying the &quot;Black Star&quot; and giving Earth its only real victory in the war. The infuriated Minbari nicknamed Sheridan the &quot;Starkiller.&quot; For his action Sheridan was awarded the Earthforce Silver Star and he became one of the few human heroes to survive the war.

Following the war, Sheridan was promoted to the rank of captain and given command of the EAS &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in the mid-2250s. The &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was one of the new &quot;Omega-Class&quot; destroyers which were much larger and more powerful than the older &quot;Hyperion-Class&quot;. Sheridan spent the next few years leading the &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in exploratory and diplomatic missions. He was one of the candidates to command Babylon 5, but was rejected by the Minbari in favor of Jeffrey Sinclair. However, Earth Alliance President Santiago kept him as his first choice in the event something happened to Sinclair. Also perhaps around that time, he remarried, this time to Anna Sheridan, who had been a close friend of his sister Elizabeth Sheridan.

At some point in his career, Sheridan played a major role in quelling the Mars Riots, something which proved to be a significant sore spot a number of years later between him and the Mars Rebellion when he offered them independence in exchange for their assistance in overthrowing President Clark&#x27;s regime.

===Season 2===
When Commander Jeffrey Sinclair was reassigned as ambassador to Minbar in January 2259, Sheridan was chosen to command Babylon 5. Sheridan was initially not well received by the Minbari, and was still called &quot;Starkiller&quot; by many in the warrior caste. Soon after his arrival, in &quot;Points of Departure,&quot; the Minbari ship &quot;Trigati&quot;, which had disappeared during the Battle of the Line, reappeared and tried to provoke him into firing upon it. However, Sheridan remained cool and defused the situation. Even with the strained relations with the Minbari, Delenn and Sheridan began to develop a close friendship. Sheridan also had some initial doubts about taking command of Babylon 5 because he feared being turned into a bureaucrat, but after helping to rescue the EAS &quot;Cortez&quot;, commanded by his friend Captain Maynard, after an accident in hyperspace, he realized he was in the right place.

Sheridan soon discovered that Earth Alliance President Clark was slowly turning the Earth Alliance into a dictatorship. Sheridan found that the Nightwatch, an SA-like organization, had recruited much of the station&#x27;s security.

Soon into the season, it became known that the Shadows had returned and were beginning to move again, and even covertly aided the Centauri in defeating the Narn. When Sheridan attempted to aid a Narn vessel, the Centauri attacked Babylon 5, forcing him to destroy a Centauri warship. Given the choice of either apologizing to the Centauri or losing his command, Sheridan decided to apologize. A group of Centauri civilians attempted to assassinate Sheridan, but he was saved by Vorlon Ambassador Kosh, and the formality of the apology was dismissed in view of this event. After the fall of Narn, Minbari Ambassador Delenn revealed the existence of the Rangers to Sheridan, and offered him shared command of the Rangers on Babylon 5. Sheridan vowed that the Rangers would hold the line against the darkness, no matter what the cost.

===Season 3===
At the start of the third season, Sheridan was presented with the prototype Minbari White Star-class spacecraft. On his first mission in command of &quot;White Star One&quot;, he helped Rangers stationed at a training camp under Centauri blockade escape before being captured by the Shadows. At the same time, he had to keep an Earth Alliance official snooping around the station unaware of that mission, and his knowledge of the Shadows&#x27; involvement.

In the episode &quot;Voices of Authority,&quot; proof surfaced that Clark had arranged for President Santiago&#x27;s assassination. When Sheridan found that Clark&#x27;s administration was attempting to adapt Shadow technology from a vessel unearthed beneath the surface of Ganymede, in &quot;Messages from Earth,&quot; he destroyed the vessel rather than allowing it to fall into their hands. This led to Clark declaring martial law throughout the Earth Alliance. After martial law was declared, Sheridan defeated the Nightwatch forces by luring them into a trap.

The EAS &quot;Alexander&quot;, under the command of General William Hague, was leading the efforts against Clark. Hague was killed in an attack on the &quot;Alexander&quot;, but the ship escaped and reached Babylon 5. The EAS &quot;Churchill&quot; joined the &quot;Alexander&quot; at Babylon 5. The &quot;Churchill&quot; brought information that an attack force was a few hours away, and that the force was coming to arrest Sheridan and his staff.

Mars had decided not to implement martial law. In response Clark ordered his forces to bomb civilian targets on Mars. In response, Proxima 3 and Orion 7 seceded from the Earth Alliance. In &quot;Severed Dreams&quot; Sheridan joined them and declared Babylon 5&#x27;s own secession. Very soon after Sheridan&#x27;s declaration, an attack force arrived consisting of two Omega-class destroyers and several escorts. Clark&#x27;s attack force was soon defeated at Babylon 5. Unfortunately, the reinforcements for Clark&#x27;s attack force then arrived. Sheridan realizing that his position was hopeless was prepared to accept defeat, but at that moment Delenn came to his rescue, leading several Minbari War Cruisers to the station, while herself commanding &quot;White Star One&quot;. When told by the EarthForce ships to leave or they would engage her fleet, Delenn answered:

Realizing the situation, the EarthForce reinforcements turned around and withdrew.

In the episode &quot;War Without End&quot; Sheridan learned that he had a role to play in the disappearance of Babylon 4. Sheridan, Delenn, Marcus Cole, Ambassador Sinclair, Lennier, and Ivanova went back in time to intercept Shadow allies who were on their way to destroy that station. In a mishap, Sheridan was flung seventeen years into the future. He found himself on a devastated Centauri Prime, about to be put to death by Emperor Mollari. During this time he also learned that he had married Delenn and had a son, David. Instead of an execution, Mollari let them go. While on the way to the ship, Sheridan was pulled back into time, and back to Babylon 4. They were then able to send Babylon 4 into the distant past where it was used to fight in the first Shadow war. Sinclair stayed on board, and transformed himself into the Minbari religious figure Valen.

In Minbari culture, there are three castes: Worker, Warrior and Religious. Sheridan married three women, and while only one was Minbari, each represented a different caste: Anna (Worker), Elizabeth (Warrior) and Delenn (Religious).

For the remainder of 2260, Sheridan&#x27;s attention was directed mainly against the Shadows and the upcoming war. He began to build up an alliance of races for the larger fight. Sheridan then led a large multi-species attack force against the Shadows. While the force was able to drive them off, the allies lost far many more ships than they had hoped. For every Shadow vessel they killed, two of their ships had been destroyed.

The Shadows found that Sheridan&#x27;s wife Anna was still alive, and that she was acting as the CPU for a Shadow vessel. The Shadows pulled her out as soon as they made the connection between her and Sheridan. Because of her time in the Shadow vessel, her original personality had died. A new personality had developed, which was totally loyal to the Shadows. They then sent Anna to Babylon 5 to bring Sheridan to them on Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum.

Sheridan was once told by Kosh that if he went to Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum he would die. During his vision of the future, that version of Delenn told him not to go to Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum; also during the vision, Centauri Prime had been devastated. He began thinking that originally perhaps he had listened to Delenn and did not go to Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum. He reasoned that if he did go to Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum that the vision of the future he had seen would not occur. So he accompanied Anna on the &quot;White Star&quot; to Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum. What he did not tell her or anyone else was that he had Garibaldi hide two very large fusion bombs on the ship. A group of Shadow Vessels had surrounded Babylon 5. At that time, Delenn was listening to a recording that he made. Sheridan explained his reasons for going to Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum in the recording, and told her that he loved her.

While on Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum, the Shadows attempted to lure Sheridan to their side. He refused to cooperate. He escaped from the Shadows momentarily and reached a balcony overlooking their capital city. Anna tried one more time to get Sheridan to cooperate with the Shadows. He refused, ordering the &quot;White Star&quot; to crash into the city; the resulting over 1 gigaton nuclear explosion destroyed the capital city. Meanwhile, Sheridan, about to be killed by the explosion, jumped off the balcony into a pit that was miles deep after hearing the voice of Ambassador Kosh instructing him to do so.

When the capital city was destroyed, the Shadow vessels left Babylon 5. Sheridan&#x27;s colleagues realized that he was now dead.

===Season 4===
At the start of the fourth season, the Shadows were still recovering from the destruction of their capital city. The alliance made by Sheridan had started to fall apart. Many governments felt that if they did nothing the Shadows would leave them alone. During this time, Delenn began to organize a large Anla&#x27;Shok attack on Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum.

Meanwhile, on Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum, somehow Sheridan had survived the fall and was trapped between life and death. He met Lorien, who was the first and oldest sentient being in the galaxy. Lorien tried to talk him into letting go, that no matter how important the cause, that death could ultimately not be denied. Sheridan learned to let go of the world of the living, but he could not let go of Delenn. Lorien was able to help bring him back from the dead by giving him some of his own life force, extending Sheridan&#x27;s life by approximately twenty Earth years.

In &quot;The Summoning,&quot; some of the alien ambassadors had arranged a protest on the Zocalo against Delenn&#x27;s attack. When some bystanders tried to attack Delenn, the situation began to degenerate into a large fight. All fighting ceased when Sheridan entered the Zocalo. When an Ambassador said that they all thought he was dead, Sheridan replied by saying, &quot;I was. I&#x27;m better now.&quot; Sheridan convinced the Ambassadors to help build the largest fleet ever assembled. The hostile mob was forged into a cheering crowd ready to follow Sheridan.

Finally Sheridan confronted the Shadows and Vorlons. With Delenn, he led the alliance of Humans, Narns, Minbari, and the League of Non-Aligned Worlds, known as the Army of Light, against the Shadows. In &quot;Into the Fire,&quot; at the Battle of Coriana VI, Lorien confronted the Shadows and Vorlons telling them they must depart with the last of the First Ones &quot;beyond the rim&quot; of the galaxy.

Sheridan has made use of nuclear devices on at least four separate occasions: against the Minbari flagship, the &quot;Black Star&quot;; at Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum; at Coriana 6; and again during the events of &quot;Thirdspace&quot;. Bruce Boxleitner has consequently referred to his character as &quot;John &#x27;Nuke &#x27;em&#x27; Sheridan&quot;.

When Earthforce ships destroyed five refugee ships carrying 2,000 civilians per ship, Sheridan began a campaign to topple Clark&#x27;s administration. He first led a task force to Proxima III to break the blockade of the planet. Following the breaking of that blockade, Sheridan then headed towards Earth. Sheridan&#x27;s old ship, the &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, showed up and joined his side. While touring the &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, Sheridan received a message from Michael Garibaldi that his father had been captured by Clark&#x27;s forces, and asked him to come to Mars. Garibaldi, under the PsiCop Alfred Bester&#x27;s influence, had set a trap for Sheridan. Immediately after arriving on Mars, Sheridan was captured by Clark&#x27;s forces. In the episode &quot;Intersections in Real Time,&quot; he was questioned and tortured by Earthforce interrogators. Sheridan was able to successfully resist them despite intensive drug and psychological pressure. After Bester released Garibaldi from his telepathic conditioning, Sheridan was rescued.

The White Star fleet encounters a battle group of Advanced Destroyers (sent to engage the regular break-away Earthforce Alliance Destroyers), enhanced with Shadow technology. Susan Ivanova was mortally wounded when her command ship, the &quot;White Star 2&quot;, collided with debris from one of the destroyed enemy vessels in &quot;Between The Darkness And The Light&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Endgame,&quot; Sheridan was able to use telepaths to disable most of the loyalist Earthforce Alliance ships, stationed at Mars, saving many thousands of lives on both sides. Sheridan then took the fleet to Earth. Seeing that their fortunes had changed, the resistance on Earth went to arrest Clark, but Clark committed suicide before he could be captured, but not before he had input codes to the Earth defense network satellites, causing them to turn their weapons against the planet. All warships from either side combined to destroy the satellites and finally end the threat to Earth.

Under political pressure from the remnants of the Earth Alliance government, Sheridan resigned his Earthforce commission. In the episode &quot;Rising Star,&quot; Clark&#x27;s successor, President Luchenko, offered amnesty for all who followed Sheridan, as well as allowing Sheridan to retain his military pension and leave with full honors. The next day, the President gave a press conference.

During that same press conference Delenn and G&#x27;Kar addressed the gathering. Delenn announced that the members of the League of Non-Aligned Worlds had voted to dissolve that body, and enter into a new Interstellar Alliance. To the shock of the Earth Alliance government, Sheridan was named the first President of the Interstellar Alliance. Sheridan and Delenn returned to Babylon 5. The couple were married at this time.

===Season 5===
After returning to Babylon 5, President Sheridan began the process of leading the new Interstellar Alliance. The first years of the Alliance would bring about numerous problems that would shake the Alliance to its core. Sheridan had to work to keep the Alliance together, despite forces that were working to tear it apart. President Sheridan brought Captain Elizabeth Lochley to the station to take command. Even though Sheridan described her as Ivanova&#x27;s replacement, she was really a replacement for the both of them. Lt. Corwin took over some of Ivanova&#x27;s other duties. Sheridan gave her a free hand to run the station&#x27;s affairs, reserving only the political course of the Alliance to himself.

In the episode &quot;No Compromises,&quot; Sheridan began preparing for his formal inauguration. At about the same time he had to deal with the first assassination attempt to be made against him. A telepath saved Sheridan from being shot. The inauguration ceremony was moved to the observation dome.

After his inauguration, Sheridan gave shelter to a group of refugee telepaths led by a man named Byron, and allowed them to form a colony on Babylon 5. He felt that with Psi-Corps preparing to eventually overthrow the government that it would be beneficial to have telepaths friendly to the Alliance. In addition to helping save Sheridan&#x27;s life, Byron himself learned that the Drazi - who were members of the Alliance - were using raiders to harass the . This helped end the harassment of the - who were being bombed to the point of extinction by the raiders. Afterwards, Sheridan took the opportunity to let Garibaldi form a covert intelligence unit with several of these telepaths.

PsiCop Bester came to the station with the intention of taking the telepaths back to Earth. His group managed to arrest all the telepaths, and were about to depart. But Captain Lochley and Dr. Franklin came up with a way to delay the removal of the telepaths. Dr. Franklin found that he had the right to quarantine newly arrived people for two months, and Lochley backed him up. This gave the telepaths a respite in order to figure out a long-term solution.

In &quot;Secrets of the Soul&quot;, Byron decided to demand that the telepaths be given a home world. Byron had his telepaths spy on the various ambassadors, and learn secrets from them. In an Alliance meeting, Byron made his demand, and revealed that they had spied on the ambassadors. The PsiCops arrived soon afterwards to disband the telepath colony, and take the telepaths back to Earth. Despite attempts by Sheridan to seek a peaceful resolution to the crisis, the PsiCops insisted. Byron and a small group of telepaths committed suicide rather than allow Bester to take them back into Psi-Corps control.

===Later years===
Sheridan led the Alliance from Babylon 5 for the first year. When the Alliance headquarters in the Minbari city of Tuzanor were complete, Sheridan moved to Minbar. He led the Alliance from there for over a decade. Just before moving to Minbar, Sheridan and Delenn learned that Delenn was pregnant. Despite the fact that the baby&#x27;s human heritage could lead to danger, Delenn was able to carry the baby to term. The couple named their son David.

In &quot;Babylon 5: A Call to Arms&quot;, five years after the founding of the Alliance, Sheridan would overlook the construction of the Victory-class ship, which was a Destroyer Class White Star. While he was overseeing the ship&#x27;s development, Galen, a technomage contacted John and warning him that the Drahk were returning to exact revenge against the Alliance in a big show of force by wiping out Earth&#x27;s population with a Shadow Planet Killer which was the last type of its weapon known to exist in the galaxy after their masters, The Shadows left beyond the rim. John in the Victory-class ship, the Excalibur, with the Alliance fleet destroyed the planet killer, but much to John&#x27;s horror, he and the rest of the Alliance fleet witnessed the Drahk Fleet drop a biological weapon into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. A weapon that within five years would wipe out all life on the surface. Sheridan commissioned the Excalibur to assemble a crew and go on a mission to save Earth.

In &quot;Babylon 5: The Lost Tales&quot;, while en route to Babylon 5 for a celebration of the Alliance&#x27;s 10 year anniversary, Sheridan met Vintari, the son of the notorious Centauri emperor Cartagia. In a dream, the technomage Galen warned him that in thirty years Vintari would launch a terrible military campaign to destroy Earth, and only his death at Sheridan&#x27;s hands could stop him for sure. Sheridan chose a different path, allowing Vintari to fly in a Starfury beside him as he had always dreamed, and inviting him to stay in the Alliance&#x27;s headquarters, safe from assassination attempts which were becoming increasingly common in the Centauri royal court. In this way, he hoped to show Vintari the concept of kindness for its own sake, rather than the quid pro quo nature of assistance common on Centauri Prime. In 2279, Sheridan declined reelection to the Presidency. His wife Delenn became the second President of the Alliance, while Sheridan turned his efforts to leading the Anla&#x27;Shok.

In the final episode, &quot;Sleeping in Light&quot;, set in the year 2281, Sheridan knew that the 20 years he had been given by Lorien were almost over. He had his friends - Ivanova, Garibaldi, Franklin, and Centauri Emperor Cotto - come to his home for a final reunion. Just before their meeting, Franklin found that Sheridan only had a short time left. The next morning, Sheridan left his home and his wife for the last time. He traveled alone to Babylon 5 to see the station one last time. He learned that the station was about to be shut down and demolished. Zack Allan, who had also been invited to the reunion but hadn&#x27;t received the invitation, visited Sheridan. Sheridan learned that Allan had re-enlisted a few months prior and returned to Babylon 5, which resulted in the Ranger carrying his invitation being unable to find him on Earth. Sheridan realized that he was coming to the end. He then traveled alone to Coriana 6, where he was taken beyond the galactic rim by Lorien. His empty ship was later recovered, but his body was never found. Some Minbari believed that he would eventually return, but neither his friends nor his family ever saw him again.

* The Austro-Hungarian Navy sends officers abroad for flight training.
* In the book &quot;L&#x27;Aviation Militaire&quot; (&quot;Military Aviation&quot;), Clément Ader writes &quot;...an aircraft carrier will become indispensable. Such ships will be very differently constructed from anything in existence today. To start with, the deck will have been cleared of any obstacles: it will be a flat area, as wide as possible, not conforming to the lines of the hull, and will resemble a landing strip. The speed of this ship will have to be at least as great as that of cruisers or even greater...Servicing the aircraft will have to be done below this deck...Access to this lower deck will be by means of a lift long enough and wide enough to take an aircraft with its wings folded...Along the sides will be the workshops of the mechanics responsible for refitting the planes and for keeping them always ready for flight.&quot; Discussing the landing of aircraft, he writes, &quot;The ship will be headed straight into the wind, the stern clear, but a padded bulwark set up forward in case the airplane should run past the stop line.&quot;

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1908:

== Events ==
*The United States Army announces plans to buy flying machines.
*Fiat begins to manufacture aero engines.

===January–March===
*8 January – Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin announces plans to build an airship capable of carrying 100 passengers.
*13 January – Henri Farman wins the $10,000 Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for making the world″s first circular flight of at least in a Voisin 1907 biplane. In a flight of 1 minute 28 seconds at Issy-les-Moulineaux, France, he flies well over a kilometer at an altitude of .
*17 March – AEA Red Wing is destroyed in a crash on its second flight.
*21 March – Henri Farman makes the first flight carrying a passenger in a biplane.

===April–June===
*14 May – Charles Furnas becomes the first passenger in an aeroplane in the United States, piloted by Wilbur Wright. They fly for a distance of approximately 600m in 28-3/5ths seconds in the Wright 1905 Flyer, modified with seats for pilot and passenger. Shortly after, Orville Wright flies Furnas for 4.12 km in 4 minutes 2-2/5ths seconds.
*22 May – The Wright brothers register their airplane with the United States Patent Office.
*31 May – Henry Farman is reported to have flown with a Mlle. P. Van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, daughter of the mayor of Desteldonk in Ghent, Belgium. She is the first woman passenger in an aeroplane.
*June – Alliott Verdon Roe performs taxiing and towed flight trials with his first powered aeroplane at Brooklands, Surrey.
*28 June – Jacob Ellehammer makes the first piloted, powered aeroplane flight in Germany.

===July–September===
*The Royal Navy″s Director of Naval Ordnance, Captain Reginald Bacon, recommends that the Royal Navy acquire an airship to compete with the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;″s Zeppelins.
*4 July – Glenn H. Curtiss is awarded the &quot;Scientific American&quot; trophy for being the first person in the United States to make a public flight of over in the AEA June Bug. The award is for a flight at Hammondsport in which he flies in 1 minute and 42 seconds.
*8 July – Thérèse Peltier officially becomes the first woman to fly in an aeroplane. She is a passenger on a flight made by Léon Delagrange at Turin. However, this flight may not have been fully controlled. See also #May and #October.
*8 August – Wilbur Wright makes his first flights at the Hunaudières racetrack at Le Mans, France. The Wright Flyer used for this and later flights had been shipped to Le Havre by Orville the previous year. It had been seriously damaged by custom officials when it arrived in France and was uncrated. Wilbur spent the whole summer of 1908 rebuilding the machine and getting it into flying condition. Wilbur&#x27;s flights in this machine will have a profound effect on European aviation during the following months.
*20 August – Robert Gastambide becomes the first passenger carried by a monoplane when he is taken up on the Antoinette II.
*21 August
**Wilbur Wright moves to Camp d&#x27;Auvours, east of Le Mans, where all his flights for the remainder of the year will be based.
**The Antoinette II flies the first circle by a monoplane.
*3 September – Seeking a contract to build the United States Army″s first airplane, Orville Wright begins flight trials before Army observers at Fort Myer, Virginia, in a new Wright Model A flyer. The flight lasts 1 minute 11 seconds.
*9 September – At Fort Myer, Orville Wright sets three world records: a flight endurance record of 57 minutes 13 seconds on his first flight, a new flight endurance record of 1 hour 2 minutes and 15 seconds on his second flight (the world″s first airplane flight of over one hour), and an endurance record for a flight with a passenger (Army Lieutenant Frank P. Lahm) of 6 minutes 24 seconds on his third flight.
*10 September – At Fort Myer, Orville Wright sets a world flight endurance record of 1 hour 5 minutes and 52 seconds.
*11 September – At Fort Myer, Orville Wright sets a world flight endurance record of 1 hour 10 minutes and 24 seconds.
*12 September – At Fort Myer, Orville Wright sets a world record for flight endurance with a passenger (Army Major George O. Squier) of 9 minutes seconds.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1907:

==Events==
* Work begins on the Gnome rotary engine.

===January–December===
* 30 March – Brothers Gabriel and Charles Voisin announce the successful test flight of the Voisin company″s first airplane, the Voisin 1907 biplane.
* 5 April – Louis Blériot makes a short flight in his Blériot V monoplane.
* 6 April – Horatio Phillips achieves the first, limited, powered heavier-than-air flight in the United Kingdom when his multiplane makes a hop.
* July - The first aerodrome with hangars opens at Issy-les-Moulineaux, France.
* 1 August – The United States Army creates an Aeronautical Division within the office of the chief of its Signal Corps under Captain Charles deForest Chandler, consisting of one officer, one non-commissioned officer, and one enlisted man, with a mission to oversee &quot;all matters pertaining to military ballooning, air machines, and all kindred subjects&quot;. It is the world″s first heavier-than-air military aviation unit.
* 24 August – &quot;Ben Franklin&quot;, the largest balloon ever constructed at the time – with a capacity of 92,000 cubic feet (2,605 cubic meters) and capable of carrying 3,200 pounds (1,452 kg), including up to 12 passengers – makes its maiden flight, a meandering trip of 160 miles (258 km) from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a field near New Egypt, New Jersey, in six hours with seven people on board.
* September - The Zeppelin &quot;LZ-3&quot; sets a record by remaining aloft for eight hours.
* 29 September – Louis Breguet and Charles Richet demonstrate their Gyroplane No. 1, the first rotary-wing aircraft to lift a person off the ground. The craft does not fly freely; it is controlled by handlers with poles standing around it on the ground.
* 30 September – Flying a Voisin-Farman I biplane at Issy-les-Moulineaux, France, Henri Farman begins a progressively longer series of flights.
* 1 October – The Imperial German Army purchases its first dirigible from Luftschiffbau Zeppelin.
* 5 October – British Army Dirigible No 1, &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot;, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first powered airship, makes her first long-distance flight, flying 50 miles (80 km) from the School of Ballooning, Farnborough, Hampshire, to London in 3 hours 25 minutes, circling the dome of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral after arriving over London. Unable to make a planned return to Farnborough due to unfavorable winds, she is moored at the Crystal Palace.
* 10 October – &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot; is buffeted by high winds while moored at the Crystal Palace in London. Damaged during deflation, she will be partially dismantled and rebuilt as &quot;Nulli Secundus II&quot;.
* 12–13 October – Augustus Gaudron crosses the North Sea in a hot air balloon named &quot;Mammouth&quot;. He flies from the Crystal Palace, London to Vänern, Sweden.
* 19 October – Robert Esnault-Pelterie becomes the first pilot to fly using a control stick, at Buc, France.
* 24 October – Nine balloons take part in the second Gordon Bennett Cup international balloon race, departing from St. Louis, Missouri. The German balloon &quot;Pommern&quot;, piloted by Oscar Erbslohen and his assistant H. H. Clayton takes first place, covering a straight-line distance of 876.750 miles (1,411.836 km) to Asbury Park, New Jersey; the French balloon &quot;L&#x27;Ile de France&quot; takes second place; the German balloon &quot;Düsseldorf&quot; places third, 70.75 miles (113.93 km) behind &quot;L&#x27;Ile de France&quot;; and the American balloons &quot;St. Louis&quot; and &quot;America&quot; place fourth and fifth, respectively.
* 26 October – Henri Farman sets a world powered heavier-than-air distance record of 771 meters (2,530 ft).
* 10 November
** Louis Blériot flies his Blériot VII monoplane, the ancestor of modern tractor monoplanes.
** Henri Farman becomes the first European to be airborne in a powered heavier-than-air machine for longer than Wilbur Wright&#x27;s 59-second flight of 17 December 1903 when he flies for 1 minute 14 seconds. He covers a distance of 1030 meters (3,379 feet).
* 13 November – Paul Cornu makes the first piloted vertical take-off in a rotary-wing aircraft at Lisieux, France. The aircraft lifts off several times but proves uncontrollable, remaining airborne only a few seconds each time, and is steadied with poles so that its flights do not qualify as wholly free flights. The best flight lifts Cornu about 30 cm (1 ft.) and lasts 20 seconds.
* 30 November
** The French semi-rigid airship &quot;La Patrie&quot; breaks loose from her moorings at Souhesmes, France, with no one aboard and is swept northwest across France, England, and Ireland before disappearing over the North Atlantic Ocean.
** Glenn Curtiss founds the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, the first airplane manufacturing company in the United States.
* 23 December – The United States Army&#x27;s Aeronautical Division releases the world″s first specification for a military aircraft issued for commercial tender. The specification calls for an aircraft capable of carrying two passengers with a combined weight of at least 350 lbs (159 kg), with a top speed of at least 40 mph (64 km/h) and a range of at least 125 statute miles (201 km).

==First flights==

===January–June===
* 30 March – Voisin 1907 biplane, this first example is also known as the Delagrange No.1 after its owner, Léon Delagrange.
* 5 April – Bleriot V

===July–November===
* 11 July – Blériot VI &quot;Libellule&quot;.
* 10 September – &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot;, the British Army&#x27;s first airship.
* 10 November – Blériot VII.

===December===
* 6 December – First manned flight of the AEA Cygnet tethered glider (also referred to as a kite) designed by Alexander Graham Bell. The flight is also the first flight for Thomas Selfridge, later killed in the crash of a powered aircraft.
* 17 December – Santos-Dumont Demoiselle (No 19).

==Births==
* 30 May – Elly Beinhorn, German aviator (d. 2007)

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1906:

== Events ==

=== January–December ===

*17 January – The Zeppelin &quot;LZ2&quot; makes its first flight, which ends in a forced landing.
*18 January – The Zeppelin &quot;LZ2&quot; is destroyed in high winds.
*27 February – American aviation pioneer Samuel Pierpont Langley dies at Aiken, South Carolina.
*5 March – Romanian inventor Traian Vuia begins testing his &quot;Vuia 1&quot; at Montesson, France, by driving it as an automobile without its wings mounted. It is a high-wing monoplane powered by a carbonic acid gas engine, and is first aircraft with pneumatic tires.
*18 March – At Montesson, Traian Vuia achieves several short hops in his &quot;Vuia 1&quot;, traveling about at an altitude of about . He flies four more times; one flight travels some at an altitude of , and the longest flight is , the first manned flights of a heavier-than-air monoplane with an unassisted takeoff.
*11 August – Mrs. C.J. Miller becomes the first American woman to ride as a passenger in a dirigible.
*September – A military balloon is flown over Stonehenge in England carrying out the first aerial photography in archaeology.
*12 September – Jacob Ellehammer makes a tethered flight with his aeroplane &quot;Semi-biplane&quot; on the tiny island of Lindholm. The plane was attached to the ground by a rope and described a few circles.
*13 September – Alberto Santos-Dumont successfully flies his &quot;Santos-Dumont 14-bis&quot; aircraft for the first time, on the grounds of the Château de Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne public park in Paris.
*30 September – The Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning is awarded for the first time. It goes to Lieutenant Frank Lahm of the United States Army, who flies in the balloon &quot;United States&quot; from Paris to Fylingdales Moor in North Yorkshire, England. It is the first international balloon race.
*9 October – The Zeppelin LZ 3 flies for the first time, making a round trip in two hours.
*23 October – Alberto Santos-Dumont wins the Archdeacon Prize as for a flight of in his Santos-Dumont 14-bis at the Château de Bagatelle&#x27;s grounds.
* November – Brothers Gabriel and Charles Voisin open an aircraft factory in Billancourt, France, beginning the Voisin company.
* 12 November – Alberto Santos-Dumont flies in 21 seconds at the Château de Bagatelle&#x27;s grounds in the Santos-Dumont 14-bis which has been recently equipped with primitive interplane ailerons. This is recorded as the first officially observed aeroplane flight in Europe and, although occurring after longer flights by the Wright brothers in the United States, is the first officially recognized airplane distance record.
* 16 November – The first flight of the French Lebaudy-built semi-rigid airship &quot;Patrie&quot; takes place.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1905:

==Events==
* In Santa Clara, California, Daniel J. Maloney flies for 20 minutes with a glider after starting from a balloon at a height of .
* The engineer Maurice Stanislas Léger&#x27;s helicopter lifts a person vertically into the air in Monaco.
* U.S. Army Signal Corps transferred all balloon school activities to Fort Omaha, Nebraska.

===January–December===
*18 January – The Wright brothers begin discussions with the United States Government about selling it an airplane.
*16–20 March – Daniel Maloney is launched by balloon in a tandem-wing glider designed by John Montgomery and makes three successful flights at Aptos, California, the highest launch being at with an 18-minute descent to a predetermined landing location.
*27 April – Sapper Moreton of the British Army&#x27;s balloon section is lifted by a kite at Aldershot under the supervision of the kite&#x27;s designer, Samuel Cody.
*29 April – Daniel Maloney is launched by balloon in a tandem-wing glider designed by John Montgomery to an altitude of before release and gliding and then landing at a predetermined location as part of a large public demonstration of aerial flight at Santa Clara, California].
*6 June – Gabriel Voisin lifts off of and flies along the River Seine in his float-glider towed by a motorboat.
*23 June – The Wright brothers fly the Wright Flyer III for the first time. It is the first fully controllable and practical version of the original 1903 Wright Flyer.
*14 July – Orville Wright has a serious crash with Wright Flyer III, upon which the Wright Brothers radically alter the aircraft. The front rudder is mainly the culprit for the Flyer&#x27;s insistent pitching.
*18 July – Daniel Maloney launches a tandem-wing glider designed by John Montgomery at Santa Clara, California. A balloon cable damages the glider and upon release Maloney and the aircraft fall uncontrolled to the ground, killing Maloney. This is the third death of a heavier-than-air aircraft pilot after Otto Lilienthal in 1896 and Percy Pilcher in 1899.
*5 August – Nineteen-year-old Welshman Ernest Willows makes the first flight of Willows No. 1 a semi-rigid airship he had built.
*31 August –Balloonist John Baldwin accidentally killed during a premature dynamite/balloon stunt at County Fair, Greenville Ohio
*September – The Wright Brothers resume flight experiments with the re-designed Flyer III with performance of the airplane immediately in the positive. Smooth controlled flights lasting over 20 minutes now occur.
*7 September – Flying circles over a cornfield near Dayton, Ohio, and chasing flocks of birds, Orville Wright records history&#x27;s first bird strike. The dead bird lays on the airplane&#x27;s wing before Wright makes a sharp turn and dumps it off.
*4 October – Piloting the Flyer III over Huffman Prairie outside Dayton, Ohio, Orville Wright makes the first airplane flight in history of over 30 minutes in length.
*5 October – Wilbur Wright makes a flight of over Huffman Prairie in the Flyer III. The flight lasts for 39 minutes 23 seconds.
*14 October – The &quot;Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&quot; (FAI) is founded in Paris.
*15 October – The Wright brothers record a flight of just over in 28 minutes in the Wright Flyer III.
*16 October – The Wright brothers complete their 1905 test flight program, making their last flight until May 1908.
*30 November – At Lake Constance, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin&#x27;s LZ2 airship is damaged significantly while attempting its first launch.
* December – Neil MacDermid is carried aloft in Canada by a large box kite named &quot;The Siamese Twins&quot;, designed by Alexander Graham Bell.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1904:

==Events==
* Frenchman Robert Esnault-Pelterie flies a glider based on the Wright brothers&#x27; glider designs but employing ailerons rather than wing-warping for control. His glider is the first full-sized aircraft to employ ailerons.
* The French Navy disbands its balloon branch.
* During the Russo-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Army uses two Japanese-designed kite balloons during the Siege of Port Arthur (which begins on 1 August); they make 14 successful flights. It is Japan″s first combat use of military aviation of any kind.
* At Vladivostok, Imperial Russian Army engineer Captain Fyodor A. Postnikov and his crews make frequent ascents in spherical balloons and a kite balloon from Russian ships, and the armored cruiser &quot;Rossia&quot; tests various forms of air-sea communications from balloons and the use of shipboard balloons for directing gunfire against shore targets and in detecting naval mines.
* The Royal Swedish Navy commissions &quot;Ballondepotfartyg Nr 1&quot; (&quot;Balloon Depot Ship No. 1&quot;), a barge designed to operate one kite balloon. She is the first watercraft designed and built specifically for aeronautical purposes.

===January–December===
* January – Before the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, the Imperial Russian Navy conducts many experiments with towing balloons and man-lifting kites from its warships.
*22 and 24 March – The Wright brothers apply for patents for their flying machine in France and Germany.
*1 April – Captain Ferdinand Ferber makes a failed attempt to fly an Archdeacon glider at Berck sur Mer, Picardy.
*3 April – Gabriel Voisin successfully flies a modified Archdeacon glider at Berck sur Mer, Picardy. Voisin added a canard to the design. His longest flight on this day is 25 seconds.
*23 April – Thomas Scott Baldwin makes a flight with August Greth&#x27;s dirigible &quot;The California Eagle&quot; at San Francisco. This flight predated his efforts with the &quot;California Arrow.&quot;
*April–May – John J. Montgomery and Thomas Scott Baldwin work together at Santa Clara College in California using a wind tunnel to refine propeller designs for dirigibles. These propeller designs were used on Baldwin&#x27;s successful &quot;California Arrow&quot; later in 1904 and the wind tunnel was the first of its kind on the west coast of America.
*9–11 May – The Imperial Russian Navy armored cruiser &quot;Rossia&quot; carries a balloon on a raiding cruise against Japanese ships into the Sea of Japan in the first use by a warship of a balloon on the high seas in wartime. The balloon makes 13 successful ascents before it breaks its mooring lines and is damaged after landing on the sea.
*23 May – The Wright brothers make their first flight attempt in the &quot;Wright Flyer II&quot;. They are not successful.
*25 May – In Tandil, Argentina, Guido Dinelli flies his &quot;Aeroplano apparatus&quot; glider attached to a bicycle for .
*26 May – The Wright brothers make their first successful flight in the &quot;Wright Flyer II&quot;. It is the first of 105 flights they will make in the &quot;Flyer II&quot; during 1904.
* June – The British Army tests Samuel Cody&#x27;s person-carrying kites at Aldershot.
* June – John J. Montgomery makes a series of successful test flights with his tandem-wing glider design near San Juan Bautista, California as a prototype to his successful 1905 gliders that were used to make the first high-altitude flights in heavier-than-air flying machines in the world.
* August – An Imperial Japanese Navy observer in an Imperial Japanese Army kite balloon spots fire for a naval shore battery against Russian ships in the harbor at Port Arthur during the Siege of Port Arthur. It is the first time in history that an observer in any kind of aerial device directs gunfire against a purely naval target.
*3 August – Major Thomas Scott Baldwin demonstrates the first successful U.S. airship, &quot;California Arrow&quot;, at Oakland, California.
*20 September – Wilbur Wright makes the world&#x27;s first circuit flight, in the &quot;Wright Flyer II&quot;.
* November – The Imperial Russian Navy begins conversion of the passenger ship &quot;Lahn&quot; into an aviation ship named &quot;Russ&quot; capable of handling a spherical balloon and eight kite balloons and of supporting aerial photography. &quot;Russ&quot; is the first self-propelled, seagoing ship intended specifically for aeronautical services and the first ship to employ multiple aeronautic devices.
*9 November – Wilbur Wright flies the &quot;Wright Flyer II&quot; a distance of near Dayton, Ohio, the first flight of longer than five minutes.
* Date not known – Horatio Phillips in the United Kingdom experiments with a slat-winged multiplane aircraft. It is a fully self-propelled, autonomous take-off fixed wing aircraft using an internal combustion engine and a single tractor propeller that includes its own wheeled landing gear and modern looking tail empennage. It flies for a short hop but is unstable.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1902:

==Events==
*The Wright brothers fly their No. 3 Glider, with assisted take off, on over 700 flights, results lead directly to the construction of the Flyer.
*The British Admiralty rejects a proposal to use captive balloons for submarine detection.
*On an unspecified Sunday in 1902, the Ezekiel Airship is claimed to have flown in Pittsburg, Texas. According to these claims, the craft flew approximately at a height of between and in the presence of only a handful of witnesses; those involved allegedly took an oath of silence, and there is no physical evidence to support any of their claims.

===January – December===
* January – British Army Colonel James Templer visits the Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont in Paris and compiles a report on Santos-Dumont&#x27;s non-rigid airships. The British War Office approves his recommendation that the British Army begin experimenting with such airships. The first British airship will result from this program, and will make its first flight in 1907.
*10 January – German meteorologist and aerologist Arthur Berson and balloonist Hermann Elias set a German balloon distance record, covering 1,470 kilometers (913 miles) from Berlin, Germany, to Poltava in the Russian Empire in 30 hours.
*17 January – Gustave Whitehead claims a circling 11 km (7 mi) flight over water in a 40 hp- 29.9-kW- engine-powered flying machine with wheels and an amphibious boat-shaped hull. He supposedly makes a water landing near his starting point, and helpers pull him from the water.
*28 January to 14 February – Alberto Santos-Dumont starts a series of 5 experimental airship flights in Monaco. 
*4 February – First balloon flight in Antarctica when Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton ascend to 800 feet (240 m) in a tethered hydrogen balloon to take the first Antarctic aerial photographs.
* March – Professor Erich von Drygalski&#x27;s 1901–1903 German Antarctic Expedition uses a balloon to survey the Antarctic coast of Wilhelm II Land.
*30 April – The St Louis Aeronautical Exposition opens in Missouri.
*12 May – Brazilian Augusto Severo and French engineer Georges Saché fly the semi-rigid airship &quot;Pax&quot;, which Severo designed, over Paris for its maiden flight. When they begin to lose control of the airship, it catches fire and explodes 1,200 feet (366 m) above Montparnasse Cemetery, killing both men instantly.
*15 May – Lyman Gilmore, United States, later claims to have been the first person to fly a powered aircraft (a steam-powered glider), on this date, but there were no witnesses.
*13 October – Over Paris, Hungarian-born French diplomat Herlad de Bradsky and electrical engineer Paul Morin fly an airship of their own design on its first test flight. At an altitude of about 600 feet (183 m), the gondola separates from rest of the airship and the two men fall to their deaths.
*October 1902. – The Wright brothers complete development of the three-axis control system with the incorporation of a movable rudder connected to the wing warping control on their 1902 Glider. They subsequently make several fully controlled heavier than air gliding flights, including one of 622.5 ft (189.7 m) in 26 seconds. The 1902 glider is the basis for their patented control system, still used on modern fixed-wing aircraft.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1901:

==Events==
*At the start of the 20th century, French Navy uses shipboard balloons and man-lifting kites. They are a major user of them.
*The French Navy torpedo boat tender &quot;Foudre&quot; operates a spherical balloon experimentally during naval maneuvers in the Mediterranean Sea.

===January – December ===
*10 January – German meteorologist and aerologist Arthur Berson and artillery officer Alfred Hildebrandt travel from Berlin, Germany, to Markaryd, Sweden, in a balloon, becoming the first people to cross the Baltic Sea by air.
*11 July – The Wright brothers arrive for their second season at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, during which they will test their 1901 glider.
*27 July – Wilbur Wright makes 17 flights in the Wright 1901 glider on the first day of the glider″s flight trials at Kitty Hawk.
*31 July – In a 7½-hour flight from Berlin-Tempelhof to Briesen, Germany, German meteorologists Arthur Berson and Reinhard Süring climb to 10,800 meters (35,433 feet) in the free balloon &quot;Preussen&quot;, setting a world altitude record for human flight which will stand until 27 May 1931.
*8 August – Wilbur Wright achieves a flight of 389 feet (118.5 m) at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in the Wright 1901 glider.

<doc id="567979" wikidata="Q1004645" url="?curid=567979" title="Face-off">
<text>A face-off is the method used to begin and restart play after goals in some sports using sticks, primarily ice hockey, bandy, floorball, broomball, rinkball, and lacrosse.

During a face-off, two teams line up in opposition to each other, and the opposing players attempt to gain control of the puck or ball after it is dropped or otherwise placed between their sticks by an official.

==Ice hockey==

Hockey face-offs (also called &#x27;bully&#x27;, and originally called &#x27;puck-offs&#x27;) are generally handled by centres, but are sometimes handled by wingers, and, rarely, by defensemen. One of the referees drops the puck at centre ice to start each period and following the scoring of a goal. The linesmen are responsible for all other face-offs.

One player from each team stands at the face-off spot (see below) to await the drop of the puck. All teammates must be lateral to or behind the player taking the face-off. Generally, the goal of the player taking the face-off is to draw the puck backward, toward teammates; however, they will, occasionally attempt to shoot the puck forward, past the other team, usually to kill time when shorthanded although shooting directly at the net is also possible—scoring a goal directly from a face-off, while rare, is not unheard of. However, where the face-off occurs at one of the five face-off spots that have circles marked around them, only the two opposing players responsible for taking the face-off may be in the circle. A common formation, especially at centre ice, is for a skater to take the face-off, with the wings lateral to the centre on either side, and the skater, usually a defenseman, behind the player handling the face-off, one toward each side. This is not mandatory, however, and other formations are seen—especially where the face-off is in one of the four corner face-off spots.

Face-offs are typically conducted at designated places marked on the ice called &quot;face-off spots&quot; or &quot;dots&quot;. There are nine such spots: two in each attacking zone, two on each end of the neutral zone, and one in the centre of the rink. Face-offs did not always take place at the marked face-off spots. If a puck left the playing surface, for example, the face-off would take place wherever the puck was last played. On June 20, 2007, the NHL Board of Governors approved a change to NHL Rule 76.2, which governs face-off locations. The rule now requires that all face-offs take place at one of the nine face-off spots on the ice, regardless of what caused the stoppage of play. Rule 76.2 also dictates that, with some exceptions, a face-off following a penalty must occur at one of the two face-off dots of the offending team&#x27;s end.

An official may remove the player taking the face-off if the player or any players from the same team attempt to gain an unfair advantage during the face-off (called a face-off violation). When a player is removed, one of the teammates not originally taking the face-off is required to take the face-off. Common face-off violations include: moving the stick before the puck is dropped, not placing the stick properly when requested to do so, not placing the body square to the face-off spot, or encroachment into the face-off circle by a teammate. In the NHL, the player from the visiting team is required to place his stick on the ice for the face-off first when it takes place at the centre-line dot. For all other face-offs, the player from the defending team must place his stick first. Before the league&#x27;s , the visiting player was required to place his stick first on all face-offs.
A player who does faceoffs as a speciality is sometimes called or deemed a Face-Off Specialist.

===History===
In the first organized ice hockey rules (see Amateur Hockey Association of Canada, AHAC), both centres faced the centre line of the ice rink, like the wingers do today. At that time, another forward position existed, the &quot;rover&quot;, who faced forward like centres did today, but a few feet away. The opposing forwards would whack the ice on their own side of the puck three times, then strike each other&#x27;s stick above the puck, and then scramble for the puck. This manoeuvre was known as &#x27;bully&#x27;. The Winnipeg players invented what is today known as a &#x27;face-off&#x27;. In Germany and other countries the term &#x27;bully&#x27; is still commonly used.

==Bandy==
In bandy, play begins with a &quot;stroke off&quot; with each team confined to its own half of the bandy pitch. However, the game is restarted with a &quot;face-off&quot; when the game has been temporarily interrupted. The face-off is executed on the place where the ball was situated when the game was interrupted. If the ball was inside the penalty area when the game was interrupted, the face-off is moved to the nearest free-stroke point on the penalty line.

In a face-off one player of each team place themselves opposite each other and with their backs turned to their own end-lines. The sticks are held parallel to each other and on each side of the ball. The ball must not be touched until the referee has blown his whistle. At face-off the ball may be played in any direction.

In bandy, face-offs are regulated in section 4.6 of the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy (FIB).

==Floorball==

Floorball is a type of floor hockey with five players and a goalkeeper in each team, it&#x27;s played indoors with a tennis sized ball. Matches are played in three twenty-minute periods and just like ice hockey it begins with a face-off.

==Broomball==

Like in ice hockey, a game of broomball begins with a face-off.

==Rinkball==

Rinkball, a sport combining bandy and ice hockey elements, also begins with a face-off.

==Lacrosse==
===Field lacrosse===

Face-offs are used in men&#x27;s field lacrosse after each goal, and to start every quarter and overtime periods, unless a team playing man-up controls the ball at the end of the previous quarter.

In the field lacrosse face-off, two players face each other at the X in the middle of the field, in a crouching position with the ball placed on the ground on the center line between the heads of their sticks, set four inches (10 cm) apart, parallel to the midline but the ends pointing in opposite directions. Two other players from each team must wait behind wing lines, 20 yards from the faceoff spot on opposite sides of the field until the whistle.

Any player except the goalkeeper, due to the much larger head on his stick, can face off; in practice face-offs are usually taken by midfielders. When a team is down a player due to a penalty, there will only be one other midfielder on the wing, or none if two or more players are serving time. When a third player, the maximum allowed by the rules before penalties are stacked, is serving time, the team thus penalized is allowed to have one of its defensemen come out and play on the wing during a faceoff.

Players facing off must rest their stick in their gloved hands on the ground and position themselves entirely to the left of their sticks&#x27; heads. They may kneel or keep both feet on the ground. Between the time they go down into position and the referee&#x27;s whistle, the players facing off must remain still. A premature movement by any player will be called as a technical foul, and the other team will be awarded the ball. To ensure that they remain still, referees are instructed to time their whistle differently on every face-off.

At the whistle, each face-off player makes a move to clamp the ball under their stick head, or tries to direct the ball to their teammates on the wing. Only those six players can attempt to pick up the ball at first. The three attackmen and defensemen from either team must remain in their respective zones behind the restraining lines from the center line. Once possession is established, or the loose ball crosses either restraining line, the faceoff is considered to have ended and all players are allowed to leave their zones.

If the loose ball goes out of bounds on a face-off before either team can pick it up, it is awarded to the team that last touched it and all other players are released when play is restarted.

The players facing off may not step on or hold each other&#x27;s sticks to prevent the other from getting the ball. Nor may they trap the ball beneath their sticks without attempting a &quot;tennis pickup&quot; to prevent anyone from establishing possession, an action normally penalized as withholding the ball from play, another technical foul. If they pick the ball up on the back of their stick but do not immediately flip it into the pocket, it is also considered withholding. In all these cases the face-off will be ended with the ball awarded to the opposing team at the spot of the infraction. Players facing off who deliberately handle or touch the ball in an attempt to gain possession, or use their open hand to hold the opposing face-off player&#x27;s stick, receive a three-minute unreleasable penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct in addition to possession being awarded to the other team.

Under NCAA rules in college lacrosse, if a team violates rules specific to face-offs, either by false starts before them by any player at midfield or illegal actions by the players facing off, more than twice in a half, each additional violation results in a 30-second penalty assessed against the team, to be served by the designated &quot;in-home&quot; player.

A player who does faceoffs as a speciality is called a Face-Off Specialist. Also nicknamed a &quot;FOGO&quot;, which stands for &quot;face off, get off&quot;.

===Women&#x27;s lacrosse===

In women&#x27;s lacrosse, a procedure similar to a face-off is also used, although it is called a draw. The two players taking the draw stand at the center of the field, and hold their sticks together at waist level while the referee places the ball between the heads, which face each other. Four other players from each team stand on the outside of a center circle. At the whistle, the two center players both lift their sticks, tossing the ball in the air, while the players on the outside attempt to gain possession when it comes down.

==Field hockey==

A similar technique, known as a bully, is used in field hockey. The two opposing players alternately touch their sticks on the ground and against each other before attempting to strike the ball. Its use as the method of starting play was discontinued in 1981.

==Similar rules in other sports==
A face-off is also similar to other methods used to start or resume play in a variety of other sports. All of these involve two opposing players attempting to gain control of the ball after it is released by an official.

A jump ball in basketball, a ball-up in Australian rules football, and a throw-up in shinty, all involve an official throwing the ball upwards into the air after which players must play for the ball.

A dropped-ball (if contested) is a method used in association football whereby an official will drop the ball rather than releasing it into the air.

===Shinty===
A technique, known as a throw-up, is used in the stick-and-ball sport of shinty. A game of shinty begins with referee throwing the ball into the air between two opposing players whose sticks, called &quot;camans&quot;, are raised in the air. The players must play for the ball in the air.

===American football===
An event similar to a face-off has been attempted in at least two leagues of American football: the 2001 instance of the XFL instituted an &quot;opening scramble&quot;, replacing the coin toss, in which one player from each team attempted to recover a loose football after a twenty-yard dash. The team whose player recovered the ball got first choice of kicking, receiving, or defending one side of the field.

Because of an extremely high rate of injury in these events (in the league&#x27;s first game, one XFL player was lost for the season after separating his shoulder in a scramble), the event has not gained mainstream popularity in most other football leagues. X-League Indoor Football nonetheless adopted a modified version opening scramble (using the name &quot;X-Dash&quot;) when it began play in 2014, but tweaked to avoid the injuries so that each player chased after their own ball.

===Coin toss===
The coin toss remains the method of choice for determining possession at the beginning of an American football game.

<doc id="567980" wikidata="Q7731753" url="?curid=567980" title="The Elements of Typographic Style">
<text>The Elements of Typographic Style is a book on typography and style by Canadian typographer, poet and translator Robert Bringhurst. Originally published in 1992 by Hartley &amp; Marks Publishers, it was revised in 1996, 2001 (v2.4), 2002 (v2.5), 2004 (v3.0), 2005 (v3.1), 2008 (v3.2), and 2012 (v4.0). A history and guide to typography, it has been praised by Hermann Zapf, who said &quot;I wish to see this book become the Typographers&#x27; Bible.&quot; Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones consider it &quot;the finest book ever written about typography,&quot; according to the FAQ section of their type foundry&#x27;s website. Because of its status as a respected and frequently cited resource, typographers and designers often refer to it simply as &quot;Bringhurst&quot;.

The title alludes to &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, the classic guide to writing by Strunk and White.

<doc id="567981" wikidata="Q970339" url="?curid=567981" title="Chōfu Airport">
<text>is an airport located northwest of Chōfu, Tokyo, Japan, west of central Tokyo. It is administered by the Bureau of Port and Harbor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The airport&#x27;s main commercial activity is New Central Airservice commuter flights to the Izu Islands south of Tokyo.
==History==
Plans for Chōfu airfield were made in 1938. Construction started in 1939 and the airport opened in 1941. It had two runways, one of 1000 meters and one of 675 meters. Although it was originally envisioned as a public airport, with the onset of World War II it was exclusively used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service. The airfield was host to Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien fighters used for air defense against Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombing raids by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF).

In 1944 a number of concrete hangars were built to protect the aircraft from air attacks. Two of these are preserved in what is now a small park to the east of the current airport.

Occupied after the war by American forces, the airfield was briefly used as a base for Lockheed F-5 Lightning photo-reconnaissance aircraft of the 6th and 71st Reconnaissance Groups beginning in late September 1945, mapping the extent of wartime damage over Honshū. The mapping flights ended in January 1946, ending operational military use by the Americans. The USAAF saw no need for the facility, especially given its proximity to the densely populated urban area. It was turned over to the occupation government in 1946.

Chofu Airfield was returned to the Japanese government in 1972 as part of the Kanto Plain Consolidation Plan, under which several US military facilities in the Greater Tokyo Area were returned to Japan in exchange for upgrades to Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo. The nearby Kanto Mura military housing complex was returned to Japan in 1974. Public commercial air service began in 1979 with flights to Niijima.

==Current users==
The airport is currently used by a number of companies including Aerotec, Jamco, Toho Air Service, and New Central Airservice.

The airfield is also used by the National air and space agency JAXA which headquarters is located here. The Chōfu Aerospace Center serves as JAXA&#x27;s major research and development base. As a focal point of aeronautical research and development in Japan, the center plays an important role in supporting and leading the growth of the Japanese aviation industry.

Like many Japanese airports, it has an observation area. There is an observation deck located on the second floor of the terminal. In addition there is a platform and a number of mounds located in the nearby parks.

==Accidents and incidents==
On March 23, 1976, Mitsuyasu Maeno, a young right-wing nationalist and actor, took off from Chōfu Airport on a self-inspired kamikaze mission into the house of Yoshio Kodama, a Japanese organized crime figure linked to the Lockheed Scandal. Maeno felt that Kodama facilitating bribes from the American aircraft company was a betrayal of right-wing values. Maeno was killed and two of Kodama&#x27;s servants were injured. Kodama was uninjured.

On August 10, 1980, a private plane crashed into the playground of Chōfu Junior High School after take-off, killing everyone on board.

On July 26, 2015, a Piper PA-46 Malibu piloted by Taishi Kawamura and carrying four passengers on board, crashed into a residential area just after take-off. Three people died in the crash, including the pilot, one of the passengers, and a woman on the ground. The other three passengers survived with injuries, as did two people on the ground. Witnesses on the ground reported that the engine made an abnormal sound as it flew over them. Several videos were uploaded to YouTube showing the airplane flying lower than usual after take-off. Three investigators from the Japan Transport Safety Board were soon dispatched to the accident site. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department also launched an investigation, suspecting professional negligence resulting in injury and death. Initial investigative work revealed the airplane was involved in a landing incident at an airport in Hokkaido in October 2004. Several anomalies with the flight plan were also found. Media speculations suggested the engine or professional negligence as likely causes of the crash.

<doc id="567982" wikidata="Q364315" url="?curid=567982" title="Jacques Attali">
<text>Jacques José Mardoché Attali (; born 1 November 1943) is a French economic and social theorist, writer, political adviser and senior civil servant.

A very prolific writer, Attali published 86 books in 54 years, between 1969 and 2023. 

Attali served as a counselor to President François Mitterrand from 1981 to 1991, and was the first head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1991 to 1993. In 1997, upon the request of education minister Claude Allègre, he proposed a reform of the higher education degrees system. From 2008 to 2010, he led the government committee on how to ignite the growth of the French economy, under President Nicolas Sarkozy.

Attali co-founded the European program EUREKA, dedicated to the development of new technologies. He also founded the non-profit organization PlaNet Finance, now called Positive Planet, and is the head of Attali &amp; Associates (A&amp;A), an international consultancy firm on strategy, corporate finance and venture capital. Interested in the arts, he has been nominated to serve on the board of the Musée d’Orsay. He has published more than fifty books, including &quot;Verbatim&quot; (1981), &quot;&quot; (1985), &quot;Labyrinth in Culture and Society: Pathways to Wisdom&quot; (1999), and &quot;A Brief History of the Future&quot; (2006).

In 2009, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; called him as one of the top 100 &quot;global thinkers&quot; in the world.

== Early life ==
Jacques Attali was born on 1 November 1943 in Algiers (Algeria), with his twin brother Bernard Attali, in a Jewish family. His father, Simon Attali, is a self-educated person who achieved success in perfumery (&quot;Bib et Bab&quot; shop) in Algiers. He married Fernande Abécassis on 27 January 1943. On 11 February 1954, his mother gave birth to his sister, Fabienne. In 1956, two years after the beginning of the Algerian independence war (1954–1962), his father decided to move to Paris with his family.

Jacques and Bernard studied at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly, in the 16th arrondissement, where they met Jean-Louis Bianco and Laurent Fabius. In 1966, Jacques graduated from the École polytechnique (first of the class of 1963). He also graduated from the École des mines, Sciences Po and the École nationale d&#x27;administration (third of the class of 1970).

In 1968, while doing an internship at the prefecture of a French department (Nièvre), he met for the second time with François Mitterrand, then President of the department, whom he had met for the first time three years before.

in 1972, Attali received a PhD in economics from University Paris Dauphine, for a thesis written under the supervision of Alain Cotta. Michel Serres was among the jury of his PhD.

In 1970, when he was 27, he became a member of the Council of State. In 1972, aged 29, he published his first two books, &quot;Analyse économique de la vie politique&quot; and &quot;Modèles politiques&quot;, for which he was awarded with a prize from the Academy of Sciences.

== Academic career ==
Jacques Attali taught economics from 1968 to 1985 at the Paris Dauphine University, at the École polytechnique and at the École des Ponts et chaussées.

In his laboratory in Dauphine, the IRIS, he gathered several young researchers Yves Stourdzé (who ran the European research program EUREKA co-founded by Jacques Attali), Jean-Hervé Lorenzi, and Érik Orsenna, but also leading figures in various fields (including journalism, mathematics, show business, financial analysis).

== Political career ==
Attali&#x27;s close collaboration with François Mitterrand started in December 1973. He directed his political campaign for the presidential elections in 1974. He then became his main chief of staff in the opposition. In 1981, François Mitterrand, after he was elected President, named Attali as his special adviser. From this moment on, Jacques Attali wrote notes every evening for the attention of the French President, which dealt with economics, culture, politics, or the last book he read. He also attended all the Cabinet meetings, the Defense Council, and all bilateral meetings between President François Mitterrand and foreign heads of States and governments. The President also entrusted him with the role of &quot;sherpa&quot; (personal representative of a head of State) for the European and G7 summits.

Attali then enlarged his circle of acquaintances to Raymond Barre, Jacques Delors, Philippe Séguin, Jean-Luc Lagardère, Antoine Riboud, Michel Serres, Coluche. He advised the President to get Jean-Louis Bianco, Alain Boublil and several young, promising graduates from the École nationale d’administration (like François Hollande and Ségolène Royal) to join his team.

In 1982, he pleaded for &quot;economic rigour&quot;. As &quot;sherpa&quot; of Mitterrand during 10 years, he organised the Versailles G7 summit in 1982 and the G7 Summit of the Arch in 1989. He took an active part in the organization of the celebrations for the bicentenary of the French Revolution on 14 July 1989.

In 1997, upon the request of Claude Allègre, he proposed a reform of the tertiary education degree system which led to the implementation of the LMD model.

In 2008 and 2010, he was asked by then President Nicolas Sarkozy to chair a bipartisan commission aiming at proposing reforms to foster French economic growth. In 2013, Attali advocated the concept of positive economy in a report delivered to President François Hollande at his request. His ideas inspired some of the provisions of the law proposed by Emmanuel Macron, Minister of Economy.

In April 2011, in Washington, D.C., the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the United States&#x27; Smithsonian Institution presented the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service to Attali.

Attali has supported Rattachism.
He is often credited with having spotted Emmanuel Macron and enabling him to become President of the French Republic. Indeed, he was the one who discovered him while he was an investment banker at Rothschild, and then introduced him to François Hollande, proposing that he become Minister of Economy.

== International career ==
In 1979, Attali co-founded the international NGO Action Against Hunger (&quot;Action Contre La Faim&quot;).

In 1984, he helped implement the European program EUREKA, dedicated to the &quot;development of new technologies&quot;, the direction of which he entrusted to Yves Stourdzé.

In January 1989, he initiated a vast international plan of action against the disastrous flooding in Bangladesh.

In August 1989, during François Mitterrand&#x27;s second mandate, Jacques Attali gave up politics and left the Elysée Palace. He founded the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), in London, and became its first president. He had initiated the idea of this institution in June 1989, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, in order to support the reconstruction of Eastern European countries. He chaired the Paris negotiating conference which led to the creation of the EBRD. Under his leadership, the EBRD promoted investments which aimed at protecting nuclear power plants, protecting the environment and, more generally, developing infrastructure, reinforcing private sector competitiveness and support transition to democracy.

In 1991, Attali invited Mikhail Gorbachev to the EBRD headquarters, in London, against the opinion of British Prime Minister John Major. By doing so, he compelled the heads of government of the G7, who were attending a summit in this town, to receive the Soviet head of state. After a stormy phone call between Jacques Attali and John Major, the British press started to criticize Attali and spread suspicions about his management of the institution. Uncontested details of the management of the EBRD – including of inefficiency and profligacy – were shocking. Some of these details were taken up by some French journalists. Attali explains his stance in a chapter of his book &quot;C&#x27;était François Mitterrand&quot;, entitled &quot;Verbatim and the EBRD&quot;: &quot;the work in question had been done under the supervision of an international working group to which I did not belong&quot;. Indeed, when Attali left the EBRD (voluntarily) the board of governors gave him final discharge for the management of the institution. However, his reputation never recovered.

In 1993, Attali won a libel suit; he had been accused of having reproduced in his book &quot;Verbatim&quot;, without François Mitterrand&#x27;s authorization, secret archives and several sentences of the French head of State which were meant for another book. The &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; even published, on the front page, an article claiming (wrongly) that President Mitterrand had asked for the book to be withdrawn from sale. François Mitterrand confirmed in a long interview that he had asked Attali to write this book, and acknowledged that he had proofread it and had been given the opportunity 
to make corrections.

In 1998, Attali founded Positive Planet, a non-profit organization which is active in more than 80 countries, employing over 500 staff, and provides funding, technical assistance and advisory services to microfinance players and stakeholders. Positive Planet is also active in France empoverished suburbs.

In 2001 Attali was subject to investigations on the charges of &quot;concealment of company assets which have been misused and influence peddling&quot;. He was discharged on 27 October 2009 by the magistrate&#x27;s court of Paris, &quot;on the benefit of the doubt&quot;.

Attali advocates the establishment of a global rule of law, which will condition the survival of democracy through the creation of a new global order. He thinks the regulation of the economy by a global financial supervisory institution may be a solution to the financial crisis which started 2008. The financial institution is a first step towards the establishment of a democratic world government, of which the European Union can be a laboratory, which was all laid to bare in his 1981 book &quot;Verbatim&quot;.

== Private financial career ==
In 1994, he founded Attali &amp; Associates (A&amp;A), an international advisory firm which specializes in strategy consulting, corporate finance and venture capital to help companies&#x27; long-term development.

In 2012, Attali became a member of the supervisory board of Kepler Capital Markets, a Swiss broker based in Geneva. The same year, Crédit Agricole sold Cheuvreux, which employs about 700 people worldwide, to Kepler Capital Markets.

He presides over the supervisory board of Slate.fr. 

== Music and arts ==
In September 2010, Attali was appointed as a member of the directorate of the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.

Attali has a passion for music: he plays the piano (he once played for the association Les Restos du Cœur), and wrote lyrics for Barbara. He is the author of the book &quot;Bruits&quot; (1977) (English: &quot;&quot;), an essay which deals with the economy of music and the importance of music in the evolution of our societies.

In 1978, he played himself in &quot;Pauline et l&#x27;ordinateur&quot;, directed by Francis Fehr.

Since 2003, he directs the Grenoble University orchestra, open to amateurs, under Patrick Souillot. He performed very different pieces, which ranged from a symphony composed by Benda to Bach&#x27;s violin concertos, a mass composed by Mozart, Barber&#x27;s Adagio and Mendelssohn&#x27;s double concerto for violin, piano and orchestra. In 2012, he conducted the &quot;Musiques en scène orchestra&quot;, performing the opening of the Barber of Sevilla and co-directed the Lamoureux Orchestra with his friend, the geneticist Daniel Cohen, during the gala of Technion University, in Paris. He also directed the Lausanne Sinfonietta in August and Ravel&#x27;s Concerto in G with the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra in Jerusalem and then in Paris. He also directed orchestra in Shanghai, Bondy, Marseille, London and Astana.

With Patrick Souillot, he created in 2012 a national organization following the model of the Fabrique Opéra Grenoble, which aims at coordinating the production of cooperative operas with the participation of students from vocational highschools.

== Reflections on growth and positive economics ==

=== Commission for the Liberation of French Growth, known as &quot;Attali Commission&quot; ===
On 24 July 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy appointed Attali to chair a bipartisan commission charged with studying &quot;the bottlenecks that constrain growth&quot;. It was composed of 42 members, freely appointed by Attali, mostly liberals and social democrats. Its unanimous report was handed over to the President on 23 January 2008. It contained various recommendations to radically transform the French economy and society in order to unlock economic growth.

=== Commission for &quot;Positive Economics&quot; ===
In 2012, French President François Hollande ordered from Attali a report on the &quot;positive economics&quot; situation. The aim of this report was to put an end to the short-termism, to move from an individualistic economy based on the short-term to an economy based on public interest and the interest of future generations, to organize the transition from an old model based on the wealth economy to a model in which economic agents will have other obligations than profit maximization. This report, written by a wide-ranging commission, proposed 44 reforms.

==Literary work==
The literary work of Attali covers a wide range of topics and almost every possible subject in the field of literature: mathematics, economic theory, essays, novels, biographies, memoirs, children&#x27;s stories, and theater. It is probably difficult to find a common thread in his work.

All of his essays revolve around the daunting task of describing the future from a long-term analysis of the past. In order to accomplish this, he undertook the task of retelling the story of human activity and its various dimensions: music, time, property, France, nomadic life, health, the seas, modernity, global governance, love and death (&quot;Bruits, Histoires du temps, La nouvelle économie française, Chemin de sagesse, Au propre et au figuré, l&#x27;ordre cannibale, Consolations, l’homme nomade, Amours, Histoire de la modernité, Demain qui gouvernera le monde, Histoires de la mer&quot;). 

He has also put forward several readers (&quot;Lignes d&#x27;horizon&quot;, &quot;Brève histoire de l&#x27;avenir&quot;, &quot;Vivement après demain&quot;) and several publications on analytical methods (&quot;Analyse économique de la vie politique&quot;, &quot;Modèles politiques&quot;, &quot;Les trois mondes&quot;, &quot;La figure de Fraser&quot;, &quot;Peut-on prévoir l&#x27;avenir ?&quot;).

His work reveals a distinct vision of history and its successive stages, which are simultaneously ideological, technological and geopolitical. Furthermore, his work entails depicting the slow transformation of humanity into an artifact in which man becomes an object to escape death, and the geopolitical evolution toward chaos that accompanies such transformation; meanwhile, man is also waiting for an awakening leading to a new global governance, a sanctification of the essential makeup of mankind, taking into account the interest of future generations, and not letting prostheses invade it.

Attali has also, in books written during key events, tried to highlight particular moments of the present and the near future (&quot;La crise et après ?&quot;, &quot;Tous ruinés dans dix ans ?,&quot; &quot;Économie de l&#x27;apocalypse&quot;) and he proposed reforms to implement, either in books he authored (&quot;Candidats, répondez !, Urgences françaises&quot;) or in collective reports (&quot;Rapport sur l&#x27;évolution de l&#x27;enseignement supérieur&quot;, &quot;sur la libération de la croissance, sur l&#x27;économie positive, sur la francophonie&quot;).

Attali also reflected on the future of the concepts of socialism and altruism (&quot;La voie humaine&quot;, &quot;Fraternités&quot;) and advocated methods of personal growth (&quot;Survivre aux crises&quot;, &quot;Devenir soi&quot;).

Since his earliest books, Attali foresaw and announced signals of the future, albeit weak at the time, that later came true: In &quot;La parole et l&#x27;outil&quot; (1976), he announced and described the shift from an energy-based society to an information-based society. In &quot;Bruits&quot;, in 1977, he announced what would later be the internet, YouTube, and the importance of musical practice; in &quot;La nouvelle économie française&quot;, in 1978, he discussed the coming emergence of the personal computer, hyper-surveillance and self-surveillance. In &quot;Les trois mondes&quot;, in 1980, he announced the shift of the centre of power around the Pacific. In &quot;L&#x27;ordre Cannibale&quot;, in 1980, he announced the advent of a prosthetic society, now known as transhumanism. In &quot;Histoires du temps&quot;, he announced the rapid pace of history and the growing immediacy of relationships. In &quot;Amours&quot;, he announced the emergence of poly-romantic relationships. In &quot;Au propre et au figuré&quot;, he announced the break-up of property and its use, and subsequently he invented the concept of the &quot;nomadic object.&quot; In &quot;Lignes d&#x27;horizons&quot;, in 1990, he predicted the relative decline of US power. In &quot;Brève histoire de l&#x27;avenir&quot;, he announced a corporate power grab by health data and insurance companies. In &quot;L&#x27;homme nomade&quot;, he described the great movement of populations whose sedentary life was only a temporary stage.

Attali has reflected on the many dimensions, as well as the place, of Jewish thought and the Jewish people in history (&quot;1492&quot;, &quot;Histoire économique du peuple juif&quot;, &quot;Dictionnaire amoureux du judaïsme&quot;); he also took on this subject at the theatre in &quot;Du cristal à la fumée&quot;.

He also reflected on inter-religious dialogue (&quot;La confrérie des Eveillés&quot; and &quot;Naissance de l&#x27;Occident&quot;).

The focus of his biographical publishing is on retelling the lives of characters who disrupted world history by the strength of their ideas: Warburg, Pascal, Marx, Gandhi, Diderot, and all those for whom he wrote a short biography in &quot;Phares&quot;, such as Averroes, Aristotle, Maimonides, Thomas Aquinas, Giordano Bruno, Darwin.

Attali&#x27;s novels, mostly categorized in fantasy genre, or at least in the slight dystopia subgenre, address the same themes. In particular, his novels revolve around the risks confronted by humanity, with characters anxious to hide, to disappear (&quot;Nouvelles&quot;, &quot;Les portes du ciel&quot;, &quot;Le premier jour après moi&quot;, &quot;Il viendra&quot;, &quot;Notre vie disent- ils&quot;).

More recently, he has chosen to combine crime novels with dystopia, imagining a reappearing police chief, whilst the action takes place in a near future period.

Attali has narrated some of the major events in which he was involved in several memoirs: first, in &quot;Verbatim 1, 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, he kept, at the request of François Mitterrand, the daily newspaper in the years during Mitterrand&#x27;s presidency. He also recounted his memories of the creation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in &quot;Europe(s)&quot; and drew a portrait of François Mitterrand in &quot;C&#x27;était François Mitterrand&quot;, from the twenty years he spent at his side.

<text>LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; () was a German passenger-carrying hydrogen-filled rigid airship that flew from 1928 to 1937. It offered the first commercial transatlantic passenger flight service. The ship was named after the German airship pioneer Ferdinand von Zeppelin, a count () in the German nobility. It was conceived and operated by Hugo Eckener, the chairman of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; made 590 flights totalling almost 1.7 million kilometres (over 1 million miles). It was operated by a crew of 36 and could carry 24 passengers. It was the longest and largest airship in the world when it was built. It made the first circumnavigation of the world by airship, and the first nonstop crossing of the Pacific Ocean by air; its range was enhanced by its use of Blau gas as a fuel. It was built using funds raised by public subscription and from the German government, and its operating costs were offset by the sale of special postage stamps to collectors, the support of the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, and cargo and passenger receipts.

After several long flights between 1928 and 1932, including one to the Arctic, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; provided a commercial passenger and mail service between Germany and Brazil for five years. When the Nazi Party came to power, they used &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; as a propaganda tool. The airship was withdrawn from service after the Hindenburg disaster in 1937 and scrapped for military aircraft production in April 1940.
==Background==
The first successful flight of a rigid airship, Ferdinand von Zeppelin&#x27;s LZ1, was in Germany in 1900. Between 1910 and 1914, Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft (DELAG) transported thousands of passengers by airship. During World War I, Germany used airships to bomb London and other strategic targets. In 1917, the German LZ 104 (L 59) was the first airship to make an intercontinental flight, from Jambol in Bulgaria to Khartoum and back, a nonstop journey of .

During and just after the war, Britain and the United States built airships, and France and Italy experimented with confiscated German ones. In July 1919 the British R34 flew from East Fortune in Scotland to New York and back. Luftschiffbau Zeppelin delivered LZ 126 to the US Navy as a war reparation in October 1924. The company chairman Hugo Eckener commanded the delivery flight, and the ship was commissioned as .

The Treaty of Versailles placed limits on German aviation which the Allies relaxed in 1925. Eckener saw an opportunity to start an intercontinental air passenger service, and began lobbying the government for funds and permission to build a new civil airship. Public subscription raised (the equivalent of US$600,000 at the time, or $ million in 2018 dollars), and the government granted over ($ million).

==Design and operation==

The LZ 127 was designed by Ludwig Dürr as a &quot;stretched&quot; version of the zeppelin LZ 126 rechristened the USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot;). It was intended from the beginning as a technology demonstrator for the more capable airships that would follow. It was built between 1926 and September 1928 at the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin works in Friedrichshafen, on Lake Constance, Germany, which became its home port for nearly all of its flights. Its duralumin frame was made of eighteen 28-sided structural polygons joined lengthwise with of girders and braced with steel wire. The outer cover was of thick cotton, painted with aircraft dope containing aluminium to reduce solar heating, then sandpapered smooth. The gas cells were also cotton, lined with goldbeater&#x27;s skins, and protected from damage by a layer containing of ramie fibre.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was long and had a total gas volume of , of which was hydrogen carried in 17 lifting gas cells (&quot;Traggaszelle&quot;), and was Blau gas in 12 fuel gas cells (&quot;Kraftgaszelle&quot;). The &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was built to be the largest possible airship that could fit into the company&#x27;s construction hangar, with only between the top of the finished vessel and the hangar roof. It was the longest and most voluminous airship when built, but it was too slender for optimum aerodynamic efficiency, and there were worries that the shape would compromise its strength.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was powered by five Maybach VL II 12-cylinder engines, each of capacity, mounted in individual streamlined nacelles arranged so that each was in an undisturbed airflow. The engines were reversible, and were monitored by crew members who accessed them during flight via open ladders. The two-bladed wooden pusher propellers were in diameter, and were later upgraded to four-bladed units. On longer flights, the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; often flew with one engine shut down to conserve fuel.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was the only rigid airship to burn Blau gas; the engines were started on petrol and could then switch fuel. A liquid-fuelled airship loses weight as it burns fuel, requiring the release of lifting gas, or the capture of water from exhaust gas or rainfall, to avoid the vessel climbing. Blau gas was about the same density as air, so burning it had little effect on buoyancy. On a typical transatlantic journey, the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; used Blau gas 90% of the time, only burning petrol if the ship was too heavy, and used ten times less hydrogen per day than the smaller zeppelin &quot;L 59&quot; did on its Khartoum flight in 1917.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; typically carried of ballast water and of spare parts, including an extra propeller. Calcium chloride was added to the ballast water to prevent freezing. The ship retained grey water from the sinks for use as additional ballast. Both fresh and wastewater could be moved forward and aft to control trim.

The airship usually took off vertically using static lift (buoyancy), then started the engines in the air, adding aerodynamic lift. Normal cruising altitude was ; it climbed if necessary to cross high ground or poor weather, and often descended in stormy weather. To measure the wind speed over the sea, and calculate drift, floating pyrotechnic flares were dropped.

When preparing to land, the crew advised the ground either by radio or signal flag. Ground crew lit a smoky fire to help the airshipmen judge wind speed and direction. The airship slowed, then adjusted buoyancy to neutral by valving off hydrogen or dropping ballast. Echo sounding with the report from an 11-mm blank round was used to measure altitude accurately. The ship flew in with its nose trimmed slightly down, made its final approach into the wind descending at per minute, then used reverse thrust to stop over the landing flag, where it dropped ropes to the ground. Landing in rough weather required a faster approach. Up to 300 people manhandled the airship into a hangar or secured it by the nose to a mooring mast.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;&#x27;s top airspeed was at ; it cruised at , at . It had a total lift capacity of with a usable payload of on a flight. It was slightly unstable in yaw, and to make it easier to fly, had an automatic pilot which stabilised it in that axis. Pitch was controlled manually by an elevatorman who tried to limit the angle to 5° up or down, so as not to upset the bottles of wine which accompanied the elaborate food served on board. Operating the elevators was so demanding and strenuous that an elevatorman&#x27;s shift was only four hours, reduced to two in rough weather.

===Layout===

The operational spaces, common areas, and passenger cabins were built into a gondola structure in the forward part of the airship&#x27;s ventral surface, with the flight deck well forward in a &quot;chin&quot; position. The gondola was long and wide; its streamlined design reflected contemporary aesthetics, minimised overall height, and reduced drag. Behind the flight deck was the map room, with two large hatches to allow the command crew to communicate with the navigators, who could take readings with a sextant through the two large windows. There was also a radio room and a galley with a double electric oven and hot plates.

The galley staff served three hot meals a day in the main dining and sitting room, which was square. It had four large arched windows, wooden inlays, and Art Deco-upholstered furniture. Between meals, the passengers could socialise and look at the scenery. On the round-the-world flight, there was dancing to a phonograph, fine wine, and Ernst Lehmann, one of the officers, played the accordion. A corridor led to ten passenger cabins capable of sleeping 24, a pair of washrooms, and dual chemical toilets. The passenger cabins were set by day with a sofa, which converted at night into two beds. The cabins were often cold, and on some sectors passengers wore furs and huddled under blankets to stay warm. There was a noticeable smell from the Blau gas, especially when the ship was stationary.

A ladder from the map room led up to the keel corridor inside the hull, and accommodation for the 36 crewmen. Officers&#x27; quarters were towards the nose; behind them were the baggage store, the crew mess room, and the quarters for the ordinary crew, who slept in wire-frame beds with fabric screens. Also along this corridor were petrol, oil and water tanks, and stowage for cargo and spare parts. Branches from the keel corridor led to the five engine nacelles, and there were ladders up to the axial corridor, just below the ship&#x27;s main axis, which gave access to all the gas cells.

===Electrical and communications systems===
The main generating plant was in a separate compartment mostly inside the hull. Two Wanderer car engines adapted to burn Blau gas, only one of which operated at a time, drove two Siemens &amp; Halske dynamos each. One dynamo on each engine powered the oven and hotplates, and one the lighting and gyrocompass. Cooling water from these engines heated radiators inside the passenger lounge. Two ram air turbines attached to the main gondola on swinging arms provided electrical power for the radio room, internal lighting, and the galley. Batteries could power essential services like radios for half an hour, and there were small petrol generators for emergency power.

Three radio operators used a one-kilowatt vacuum tube transmitter (about 140 W antenna power) to send telegrams over the low frequency (500–3,000 m) bands. A 70 W antenna power emergency transmitter carried telegraph and radio telephone signals over 300–1,300 m wavelength bands. The main aerial consisted of two lead-weighted -long wires deployed by electric motor or hand crank; the emergency aerial was a wire stretched from a ring on the hull. Three six-tube receivers served the wavelengths from 120 to 1,200 m (medium frequency), 400 to 4,000 m (low frequency) and 3,000 to 25,000 m (overlapping low frequency and very low frequency). The radio room also had a shortwave receiver for 10 to 280 m (high frequency).

A radio direction finder used a loop antenna to determine the airship&#x27;s bearing from any two land radio stations or ships with known positions. During the first transatlantic flight in 1928, the radio room sent 484 private telegrams and 160 press telegrams.

==Operational history==
The LZ 127 was christened &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; by Countess Brandenstein-Zeppelin on 8 July 1928, after her father Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the founder of the company, on the 90th anniversary of his birth. During most of its career, it was operated by Luftschiffbau Zeppelin&#x27;s commercial flight arm, DELAG, in conjunction with the Hamburg-American Line (HAPAG); for its final two years it flew for the Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei (DZR). 

Passengers paid premium fares to fly on the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; ( from Germany to Rio de Janeiro in 1934, equal to $590 then, or $ in 2018 dollars), and fees collected for valuable freight and air mail also provided income. On the first transatlantic flight, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; carried 66,000 postcards and covers.

Eckener had earned his doctorate in Psychology at Leipzig University under Wilhelm Wundt, and could use his knowledge of mass psychology to the benefit of the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;. He identified safety as the most important factor in the ship&#x27;s public acceptance, and was ruthless in pursuit of this. He took complete responsibility for the ship, from technical matters, to finance, to arranging where it would fly next on its years-long public relations campaign, in which he promoted &quot;zeppelin fever&quot;. On one of the Brazil trips British Pathé News filmed on board. Eckener cultivated the press, and was gratified when the British journalist Lady Grace Drummond-Hay wrote, and millions read, that:
&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was greeted by large crowds on most of its early voyages. There were 100,000 at Moscow and possibly 250,000 at Tokyo to see it. At Stockholm, spectators launched firework rockets around it, and on the return flight from Moscow it was punctured by rifle shots near the Soviet Union-Lithuania border. On one visit to Rio de Janeiro people released hundreds of small toy petrol-burning hot air balloons near the flammable craft. The airship captured the public imagination and was used extensively in advertising. On visits to England, it photographed Royal Air Force bases, the Blackburn aircraft factory in Yorkshire, and the Portsmouth naval dockyard; it is likely that this was espionage at the behest of the German government.

===Proving flights===
During 1928, there were six proving flights. On the fourth one, Blau gas was used for the first time. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; carried Oskar von Miller, head of the Deutsches Museum; Charles E. Rosendahl, commander of USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot;; and the British airshipmen Ralph Sleigh Booth and George Herbert Scott. It flew from Friedrichshafen to Ulm, via Cologne and across the Netherlands to Lowestoft in England, then home via Bremen, Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden, a total of in 34 hours and 30 minutes. On the fifth flight, Eckener caused a minor controversy by flying close to Huis Doorn in the Netherlands, which some interpreted as a gesture of support for the former Kaiser Wilhelm II who was living in exile there.

===First intercontinental flight (1928)===

In October 1928, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; made its first intercontinental trip, to Lakehurst Naval Air Station, New Jersey, US, with Eckener in command and Lehmann as first officer. Rosendahl and Drummond-Hay flew the outward leg. Ludwig Dettmann and Theo Matejko made an artistic record of the flight.

On the third day of the flight, a large section of the fabric covering of the port tail fin was damaged while passing through a mid-ocean squall line, and volunteer riggers (including Eckener&#x27;s son, Knut) climbed outside the airship and made repairs to the torn fabric. Eckener directed Rosendahl to make a distress call; when this was received, and nothing else was heard from the airship, many believed it was lost. After the ship arrived safely, there was some annoyance from the Lakehurst personnel that the Zeppelin had not answered repeated calls for its position and estimated arrival time. Eckener explained that because the airship was forced to fly at a reduced speed due to the damaged fin, the wind-driven generator could not generate enough power to send messages. The crossing, the longest non-stop flight at the time, had taken 111 hours 44 minutes.

Clara Adams became the first female paying passenger to fly transatlantic on the return flight. The ship endured an overnight gale that blew it backwards in the air and off course, to the coast of Newfoundland. A stowaway boarded at Lakehurst and was discovered in the mail room mid-voyage. The airship returned home and on 6 November flew to Berlin Staaken, where it was met by the German president, Paul von Hindenburg.

===Mediterranean flights (1929)===

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; visited Mandatory Palestine in late March 1929. At Rome it sent greetings to Benito Mussolini and King Victor Emmanuel III. It entered Palestine, flew over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and descended to near the surface of the Dead Sea, below sea level. The ship delivered 16,000 letters in mail drops at Jaffa, Athens, Budapest and Vienna. The Egyptian government (under pressure from Britain) refused it permission to enter their airspace. The second Mediterranean cruise flew over France, Spain, Portugal and Tangier, then returned home via Cannes and Lyon on 23–25 April.

===Forced landing in France (1929)===

On 16 May 1929, on the first night of its second trip to the US, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; lost four of its engines. With Eckener struggling for a suitable place to force-land, the French Air Ministry allowed him to land at Cuers-Pierrefeu, near Toulon. Barely able to control the ship, Eckener made an emergency landing. The incident, and the forced comradeship it engendered, softened France&#x27;s attitude to Germany and its airships slightly. The incident was caused by adjustments that had been made by the chief engineer to the four engines that failed.

On 4 August, the airship made it to Lakehurst on the second attempt. Aboard was Susie, an eastern gorilla who had been captured near Lake Kivu in the Belgian Congo and sold by her German owner to an American dealer.

===Round-the-world flight (1929)===

American newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s media empire paid half the cost of the project to fly &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; around the world, with four staff on the flight: Lady Hay Drummond-Hay, Karl von Wiegand, Australian explorer Hubert Wilkins, and cameraman Robert Hartmann. Drummond-Hay became the first woman to circumnavigate the world by air.
Hearst stipulated that the flight in August 1929 officially start and finish at Lakehurst. Round-the-world tickets were sold for almost $3000 (), but most participants had their costs paid for them. The flight&#x27;s expenses were offset by the carriage of souvenir mail between Lakehurst, Friedrichshafen, Tokyo, and Los Angeles. A US franked letter flown on the whole trip from Lakehurst to Lakehurst required $3.55 () in postage.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; set off from Lakehurst on 8 August, heading eastwards. The ship refuelled at Friedrichshafen, then continued across Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Tokyo. After five days at a former German airship shed that had been removed from Jüterbog and rebuilt at Kasumigaura Naval Air Station, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; continued across the Pacific to California. Eckener delayed crossing the coast at San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate so as to come in near sunset for aesthetic effect. The ship landed at Mines Field in Los Angeles, completing the first ever nonstop flight across the Pacific Ocean. The takeoff from Los Angeles was difficult because of high temperatures and an inversion layer. To lighten the ship, six crew and some cargo were sent on to Lakehurst by aeroplane. The airship suffered minor damage from a tail strike and barely cleared electricity cables at the edge of the field. The &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; arrived back at Lakehurst from the west on the morning of 29 August, three weeks after it had departed to the east.

Flying time for the four Lakehurst to Lakehurst legs was 12 days, 12 hours, and 13 minutes; the entire circumnavigation (including stops) took 21 days, 5 hours, and 31 minutes to cover . It was the fastest circumnavigation of the globe at the time.

Eckener became the tenth recipient and the third aviator to be awarded the Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society, which he received on 27 March 1930 at the Washington Auditorium. Before returning to Germany, Eckener met President Herbert Hoover, and successfully lobbied the US Postmaster General for a special three-stamp issue (C-13, 14 &amp; 15) for mail to be carried on the Europe-Pan American flight due to leave Germany in mid-May. Germany issued a commemorative coin celebrating the circumnavigation.

===Europe-Pan American flight (1930)===
On 26 April 1930, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; flew low over the FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium in England, dipping in salute to King George V, then briefly moored alongside the larger R100 at Cardington. On 18 May, it left on a triangular flight between Spain, Brazil, and the US, carrying 38 passengers, many of them in crew accommodation. The ship arrived at Recife (Pernambuco) in Brazil, docking at Campo do Jiquiá on 22 May, where 300 soldiers helped land it. It then flew to Rio de Janeiro, where there was no post to tether to, so it was held down by the landing party for the two hours of the visit.

During the flight north via Recife to Lakehurst, a storm damaged the rear engine nacelle, which was repaired in the hangar at Lakehurst. During ground handling of the airship there, it suddenly lifted, causing serious injury to one of the US Marines who was assisting. A few hours from home, when the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; flew through a heavy hailstorm over the Saône, the envelope was damaged, and the ship lost lift. Eckener ordered full power and flew the ship out of trouble, but it came within of hitting the ground.

The Europe-Pan American flight was largely funded by the sale of special stamps issued by Spain, Brazil, and the US for franking mail carried on the trip. The US issued stamps in three denominations: 65¢, $1.30, and $2.60, all on 19 April 1930.

===Middle East flight (1931)===
The second flight to the Middle East took place in 1931, beginning on 9 April. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; crossed the Mediterranean to Benghazi in Libya, then flew via Alexandria, to Cairo in Egypt, where it saluted King Fuad at the Qubbah Palace, then visited the Great Pyramid of Giza and hovered above the top of the monument. After a brief stop, the ship flew to Palestine where it circled Jerusalem, then returned to Cairo to pick up Eckener, who had stayed for an audience with the King. It returned to Friedrichshafen on 13 April.

===Polar flight (1931)===
The polar flight (&quot;Polarfahrt 1931&quot;) lasted from 24 to 31 July 1931. The ship rendezvoused with the Soviet icebreaker &quot;Malygin&quot;, which had Italian polar explorer Umberto Nobile aboard. It exchanged of souvenir mail with the airship, which Eckener landed on the Arctic Ocean. Fifty thousand cards and letters, weighing , were carried. The costs of the expedition were met largely by the sale of special postage stamps issued by Germany and the Soviet Union to frank the mail carried on the flight.

Writer Arthur Koestler was one of two journalists on board, along with a multinational team of scientists led by Soviet Professor Samoilowich, who measured the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and a Soviet radio operator. The expedition photographed and mapped Franz Josef Land accurately for the first time, and came within of the North Pole. It deployed three early radiosondes over the Arctic to collect meteorological data from the upper atmosphere.

===South American operations (1931–1937)===

From the beginning, Luftschiffbau Zeppelin had plans to serve South America. There was a large community of Germans in Brazil, and existing sea connections were slow and uncomfortable. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; could transport passengers over long distances in the same luxury as an ocean liner, and almost as quickly as contemporary airliners.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; made three trips to Brazil in 1931 and nine in 1932. The route to Brazil meant flying down the Rhône valley in France, a cause of great sensitivity between the wars. The French government, concerned about espionage, restricted it to a -wide corridor in 1934. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was too small and slow for the stormy North Atlantic route, but because of the Blau gas fuel, could carry out the longer South Atlantic service. On 2 July 1932 it flew a 24-hour tour of Britain.

While returning from Brazil in October 1933, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; stopped at NAS Opa Locka in Miami, Florida, and then Akron, Ohio, where it moored at the Goodyear Zeppelin airdock. The airship then appeared at the Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago. It displayed swastika markings on the left side of the fins, as the Nazi Party had taken power in January. Eckener circled the fair clockwise so that the swastikas would not be seen by the spectators. The United States Post Office Department issued a special 50-cent airmail stamp (C-18) for the visit, which was the fifth and final one the ship made to the US. 

The airship&#x27;s cotton envelope absorbed moisture from the air in humid tropical conditions. When the relative humidity reached 90%, the ship&#x27;s weight rose by almost . Exposure to tropical downpours could greatly add to this, but when under way the ship had enough reserve power to generate dynamic lift to compensate. In April 1935 it made a rough forced landing at Recife after it was caught in a rainstorm at low speed on the approach to land and the added weight of several tons of water caused it to sink to the ground. The lower rudder was lost, the outer envelope was ripped in several places, and a petrol tank was punctured by a palm tree.

In late 1935 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; operated a temporary postal shuttle service between Recife and Bathurst, in the British African colony of the Gambia. On 24 November, during the second trip, the crew learned of an insurrection in Brazil, and there was some doubt whether it would be possible to return to Recife. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; delivered its mail to Maceió, then loitered off the coast for three days until it was safe to land, after a flight of 118 hours and 40 minutes.

Brazil built a hangar for airships at Bartolomeu de Gusmão Airport, near Rio de Janeiro, at a cost of $1 million (equivalent to $ million in 2018 ). Brazil charged the DZR $2000 ($) per landing, and had agreed that German airships would land there 20 times per year, to pay off the cost. The hangar was constructed in Germany and the parts were transported and assembled on site. It was finished in late 1936, and was used four times by &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; and five by &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. It now houses units of the Brazilian Air Force.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; made 64 round trips to Brazil, on the first regular intercontinental commercial air passenger service, and it continued until the loss of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; in May 1937.

===Propaganda (1936)===
Eckener was outspoken about his dislike of the Nazi Party, and was warned about it by Rudolf Diels, the head of the Gestapo. When the Nazis gained power in 1933, Joseph Goebbels (Reich Minister of Propaganda) and Hermann Göring (Commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe) sidelined Eckener by putting the more sympathetic Lehmann in charge of a new airline, Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei (DZR), which operated German airships.

On 7 March 1936, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaties, German troops reoccupied the Rhineland. Hitler called a plebiscite for 29 March to retrospectively approve the reoccupation and adopt a list of exclusively Nazi candidates to sit in the new Reichstag. Goebbels commandeered &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; and the newly launched &quot;Hindenburg&quot; for the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. The airships flew in tandem around Germany before the vote, with a joint departure from Löwenthal on the morning of 26 March. They toured the country for four days and three nights, dropping propaganda leaflets, playing martial music and slogans from large loudspeakers, and broadcasting political speeches from a makeshift radio studio on &quot;Hindenburg&quot;.

==Retirement and aftermath==

The crew heard of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster by radio on 6 May 1937 while in the air, returning from Brazil to Germany; they delayed telling the passengers until after landing on 8 May so as not to alarm them. The disaster, in which Lehmann and 35 others were killed, destroyed public faith in the safety of hydrogen-filled airships, making continued passenger operations impossible unless they could convert to non-flammable helium. &quot;Hindenburg&quot; had originally been planned to use helium, but almost all of the world&#x27;s supply was controlled by the US, and its export had been tightly restricted by the Helium Act of 1925.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was permanently withdrawn from service shortly after the disaster. On 18 June, its 590th and last flight took it to Frankfurt am Main, where it was deflated and exhibited to visitors in its hangar. President Roosevelt supported exporting enough helium for the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;-class LZ 130 &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; to resume commercial transatlantic passenger service by 1939, but by early 1938, the opposition of Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, who was concerned that Germany was likely to use the airship in war, made that impossible. On 11 May 1938, Roosevelt&#x27;s press secretary announced that the US would not sell helium to Germany. Eckener, who had unsuccessfully intervened, responded that it would be &quot;the death sentence for commercial lighter-than-air craft.&quot; &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; made 30 test, promotional, propaganda and military surveillance flights around Europe using hydrogen between September 1938 and August 1939; it never entered commercial passenger service. On 4 March 1940, Göring ordered &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; and &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; to be scrapped, and their airframes to be melted down for the German military aircraft industry.

During its career, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; had flown almost 1.7 million km (1,053,391 miles), the first aircraft to fly over a million miles. It made 144 oceanic crossings (143 across the Atlantic, and one of the Pacific), carried 13,110 passengers and of mail and freight. It flew for 17,177 hours (717 days, or nearly two years), without injuring a passenger or crewman. It has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s most successful airship&quot;, but it was not a commercial success; it had been hoped that the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;-class airships that followed would have the capacity and speed to make money on the popular North Atlantic route. &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;&#x27;s achievements showed that this was technically possible.

By the time the two &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;s were recycled, they were the last rigid airships in the world, and heavier-than-air long-distance passenger transport, using aircraft like the Focke-Wulf Condor and the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, was already in its ascendancy. Aeroplanes were faster, less labour-intensive and safer; by 1958 they developed into passenger jets like the Boeing 707 which could cross the Atlantic reliably in a few hours. By 2017 annual air passenger journeys had surpassed 4 billion. 

Modern airships like the Zeppelin NT use semi-rigid designs and are lifted by helium on their mainly sight-seeing duties.

<text>Boarding in ice hockey is a penalty called when an offending player pushes, trips or checks an opposing player violently into the boards (walls) of the hockey rink.

In ice hockey, the boarding call is often a major penalty due to the likelihood of injury sustained by the player who was boarded, and officials have the discretion to call a game misconduct or a match penalty (if they feel the offense was a deliberate attempt to injure) on the offending player. However, in the North American professional ice hockey league, the NHL, if a major penalty is assessed and the boarded player sustains a head or facial injury, the offending player receives an automatic game misconduct. If no injury is sustained, then a minor penalty will be called. In college ice hockey, the player does not need to be injured for it to be a major penalty. Boarding is usually assessed against a player when the opposing player is hit 4–5 feet away from the boards and hits one&#x27;s head against the boards on the way down.

<text>Checking in ice hockey is any of a number of defensive techniques aimed at disrupting an opponent with possession of the puck or separating them from the puck entirely. Most types are not subject to penalty.

== Types ==
===Body checking===
A player drives the shoulder, upper arm and hip and elbow, equally into the opponent to separate them from the puck, using the body to knock an opponent against the boards or to the ice. This is often referred to as simply &quot;checking&quot; or &quot;hitting&quot; and is only permitted against an opponent with possession of the puck. Body checking can be penalized when performed recklessly.

In women&#x27;s IIHF ice hockey, body checking is considered an &quot;illegal hit&quot; as well as in non-checking leagues, and is punishable by a minor penalty, major penalty and automatic game misconduct, or match penalty. Body checking was allowed at the first women&#x27;s world ice hockey championship in 1990 but has been considered illegal since.

===Hip-checking===
When a player drops to a near-crouching stance and swings his hips toward an opposing player, sending the opponent off balance, often falling to the ice. This is performed most commonly against the boards. A hip-check at or below the knees is called &quot;clipping&quot;; it is considered an infraction in the National Hockey League.

===Shoulder-checking===
A player puts shoulder into an opponent to muscle the other player out of position. The elbow must be tucked in or the act may be considered &quot;elbowing&quot;, which is against the rules and can result in a penalty.

===Poke checking===
Using the stick to poke the puck away from an opponent. For example, a defensive player may hit the puck out of the puck carrier&#x27;s possession before making physical contact. This is a common form of checking for goalies to use against opponents that approach closely, since they must avoid moving their bodies far from the goal.

===Hook checking===
Using the stick in a hooking manner on the ice surface to retrieve the puck from opponent players. Hook checking should not be confused with the other infraction &quot;hooking&quot;.

===Sweep checking===
Using the stick in a sweeping motion to knock the puck away from opponents or deter them from passing.

===Stick checking===
Using the stick to interfere with an opponent&#x27;s stick.

===Forechecking===
Skating done in the offensive zone, often to recover possession of the puck after a dump in or turnover.

===Backchecking===
Rushing back to the defensive zone in response to an opposing team&#x27;s attack. While behind the attacker, a defender may try to make physical contact with the puck carrier to check so that the opposing team may regain control of the puck.

===Cross-checking===
The act of checking an opponent with the shaft of the stick held in both hands. This is illegal and earns a minor, major, misconduct, or match penalty depending on the severity of the infraction.

===Lift checking===
Using the stick to lift or knock an opponent&#x27;s stick upwards followed immediately by an attempt to steal the puck. This may also be used by a defender to keep an attacker from deflecting shots when both players are positioned in front of the net.

===Press checking===
Using the stick to stop or control the movement of an opponent&#x27;s stick by placing pressure over the top of the opponent&#x27;s stick.

== Body checking in other winter team sports ==

Body checking is disallowed in the winter team sports of bandy, rink bandy, rinkball, ringette, spongee, and some broomball and ice hockey leagues, though other forms and levels of body contact may occur during play in each of the respective sports.

Although some broomball leagues allow the use of body checking, the sport in all of its formats and variants uses shoes or shoes with special soles for traction on the ice and does not use any type of ice skate. As a result, the body checking style used in broomball leagues that allow it are different from the style used in ice hockey and more closely resemble the style seen used in either lacrosse or box lacrosse.

== Rules on checking ==

=== Illegal checking ===
Charging, hitting from behind and boarding are examples of illegal hits. &quot;Charging shall mean the actions of a player who, as a result of distance traveled, shall violently check an opponent in any manner. A “charge” may be the result of a check into the boards, into the goal frame, or in open ice&quot;. Boarding is when a check violently throws a defenseless player into the boards. Due to their dangerous nature and increased likelihood of causing serious injury, these hits can have penalties ranging from a minor two-minute penalty to a major and game misconduct.

Any form of body checking is not allowed in leagues with young children. Men&#x27;s amateur leagues typically allow checking unless stipulated otherwise in league rules. Some intramural university leagues do not permit body checking, in order to avoid injury and incidents of fighting. &quot;Leaning&quot; against opponents is an alternative to body checking but can be penalized for holding if abused. Many studies have been done regarding injuries in hockey that have caused stricter rule enforcement in the 2010s. There have been decreases in the number of concussions and other serious injuries since these changes.

Beginning with the 2010–11 NHL season, any form of &quot;lateral or blind side hit to an opponent, where the player&#x27;s head is targeted and/or the principal point of contact&quot; (which is known as an illegal check to the head) became prohibited. That season, an illegal check to the head is punishable with either a major penalty and a game misconduct, or a match penalty. This new rule was instituted as a result of concussion injuries to NHL players in previous seasons.

One season later, the criteria were changed so that the opponent&#x27;s head was both the principal point of contact and targeted. That hit is punishable with either a two-minute minor or a match penalty. In the 2013–14 NHL season, the rule was clarified to &quot;A hit resulting in contact with an opponent&#x27;s head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted.&quot; As mentioned before, that is punishable with either a two-minute minor or a match penalty.

=== New NHL standard of rule enforcement, 2005–06 ===
For the 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted stricter enforcement of many checking violations that in previous seasons would not have been penalized. The intent of the new standard of enforcement was to fundamentally alter the way ice hockey is played, rewarding speed and agility over brute strength, as well as increasing opportunities for scoring and minimizing stoppage of play. However, it is unclear how expanding the definition of a penalty would minimize the stoppage of play, as penalty calls entail play stoppage. One explanation may be that more clearly defined rules give players more distinct boundaries on penalties, resulting in fewer penalties. The intended result is a faster-paced game with generally higher scores than in previous years.

=== New USA Hockey rules on checking, 2011–12 ===
Beginning in the 2011–12 season, USA Hockey moved the age of legal body checking from 12U to 14U. The discussion of this rule change began with a look into Peewee (12U) and Squirt (10U) levels of hockey. Through observation, it was clear that Squirts skate more aggressively and try to play in the correct manner. Peewees in similar situations would either let the opponent get the puck first so they can check them or hold back so they don&#x27;t get hit themselves. Injury was not an initial concern, but with research it was brought into the discussion. Research shows that the 11-year-old brain has not developed skills to anticipate. As a result, Peewees acquire injuries four times more in checking vs. non-checking hockey.

<text>Academi, formerly known as Blackwater and Blackwater Worldwide, is an American private military contractor founded on December 26, 1997, by former Navy SEAL officer Erik Prince. It was renamed Xe Services in 2009, and was again renamed to Academi in 2011, after it was acquired by a group of private investors. In 2014, Academi merged with Triple Canopy to form Constellis Holdings.

Constellis and its predecessors provide contract security services to the United States federal government. Since 2003, it has provided services to the Central Intelligence Agency.

In 2007, Blackwater received widespread notoriety for the Nisour Square massacre in Baghdad, when a group of its employees killed 17 Iraqi civilians and injured 20. Four employees were convicted in the United States and later pardoned on December 22, 2020, by President Donald Trump.

==History==
===Origins as training center===
Blackwater USA was formed on December 26, 1996, by Al Clark and Erik Prince in North Carolina, to provide training support to military and law enforcement organizations. In explaining its purpose, Prince stated: &quot;We are trying to do for the national security apparatus what FedEx did for the Postal Service.&quot;

Prince purchased approximately of the Great Dismal Swamp, a vast swamp on the North Carolina–Virginia border that is now mostly a national wildlife refuge. &quot;We needed 3,000 acres to make it safe,&quot; Prince told reporter Robert Young Pelton. There he created his private training facility and his contracting company, Blackwater, which he named for the peat-colored water of the swamp.

The Blackwater Lodge and Training Center officially opened on May 15, 1998, with a , $6.5 million facility headed by Robert Anderson. It comprises several ranges: indoor, outdoor, urban reproductions; an artificial lake; and a driving track in Camden and Currituck counties. The company says it is the largest training facility in the country. The concept was not a financial success but was kept solvent by sales from sister company Blackwater Target Systems.

===2002–2007: Blackwater Security Company===
Jeremy Scahill has claimed that Blackwater Security Company (BSC) was the brainchild of Jamie Smith, a former CIA officer who became vice president of Blackwater USA and the founding director of Blackwater Security Company, holding both positions simultaneously. However, this claim is denied by Prince and Blackwater executive Gary Jackson, who describe firing Smith from his position as a low-level administrator for &quot;non-performance&quot; after a thirty-day contract. Smith has been accused of further embellishing his military and contracting record to defraud investors at SCG International Risk.

====2003–2006: First contracts====
BSC&#x27;s first assignment was to provide twenty men with top-secret clearance to protect the CIA headquarters and another base that was responsible for hunting Osama bin Laden. Blackwater was one of several private security firms employed following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. BSC was originally formed as a Delaware LLC and was one of over sixty private security firms employed during the Iraq War to guard officials and installations, train Iraq&#x27;s new army and police, and provide other support for coalition forces.

Gulmurod Khalimov, former war minister of the Islamic State, trained with Blackwater and the U.S. Army five times between 2003 and 2015. Khalimov was a officer and sniper of the OMON special forces unit of Tajikistan at the time. The United States Department of State confirmed this in 2015. However, Khalimov was quoted as saying in Russian, “Listen, you American pigs: I’ve been to America three times. I saw how you train soldiers to kill Muslims. You taught your soldiers how to surround and attack, in order to exterminate Islam and Muslims”.

Blackwater was hired during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to protect government facilities, as well as by private clients, including communications, petrochemical, and insurance companies. Overall, the company received over US$1 billion in U.S. government contracts. The company consisted of nine divisions and a subsidiary, Blackwater Vehicles.
In August 2003, Blackwater received its first Iraq contract, a $21 million contract for a personal security detachment and two helicopters for Paul Bremer, head of the U.S. occupation in Iraq.

In July 2004, Blackwater was hired by the U.S. Department of State under the Bureau of Diplomatic Security&#x27;s Worldwide Personal Protective Services (WPPS) umbrella contract, along with DynCorp International and Triple Canopy, Inc. for the purpose of providing protective services in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Israel. The contract applied for two years and expired on June 6, 2006. It authorized 482 personnel, and Blackwater received $488m for its work.

On September 1, 2005, following Hurricane Katrina, Blackwater dispatched a rescue team and helicopter to support relief operations. Blackwater moved about 200 personnel into the area impacted by Hurricane Katrina, most of whom (164 employees) were working under a contract with the Federal Protective Service to protect government facilities, but the company held contracts with private clients as well. Blackwater&#x27;s presence after Katrina cost the federal government $240,000 per day.

In May 2006, the U.S. State Department awarded WPPS II, the successor to its previous diplomatic security contract. Under this contract, the State Department awarded Blackwater, along with Triple Canopy and DynCorp, a contract for diplomatic security in Iraq. Under this contract, Blackwater was authorized to have 1,020 staff in Iraq. Blackwater&#x27;s responsibilities included the United States embassy in Iraq. At the time it was a privately held company and published limited information about internal affairs.

====Leadership====
Cofer Black, the company&#x27;s vice-chairman from 2006 through 2008, was director of the CIA&#x27;s Counterterrorist Center (CTC) at the time of the September 11 attacks in 2001. He was the United States Department of State coordinator for counterterrorism with the rank of Ambassador-at-Large from December 2002 to November 2004. After leaving public service, Black became chairman of the privately owned intelligence-gathering company Total Intelligence Solutions, Inc., as well as vice-chairman of Blackwater.

Robert Richer was vice president of intelligence until January 2007, when he formed Total Intelligence Solutions. He was formerly the head of the CIA&#x27;s Near East Division.

====2006–2007: New training centers====
In November 2006, Blackwater USA announced that it had acquired an facility west of Chicago in Mount Carroll, Illinois, called Impact Training Center. This facility has been operational since April 2007 and serves law enforcement agencies throughout the Midwest.

Blackwater tried to open an training facility three miles north of Potrero, a small town in rural east San Diego County, California, located east of San Diego, for military and law enforcement training. The opening had faced heavy opposition from local residents, residents of nearby San Diego, local Congressmember Bob Filner, and environmentalist and anti-war organizations. Opposition focused on a potential for wildfire increases, the proposed facility&#x27;s proximity to the Cleveland National Forest, noise pollution, and opposition to the actions of Blackwater in Iraq. In response, Brian Bonfiglio, project manager for Blackwater West, said: &quot;There will be no explosives training and no tracer ammunition. Lead bullets don&#x27;t start fires.&quot; In October 2007, when wildfires swept through the area, Blackwater made at least three deliveries of food, water, personal hygiene products and generator fuel to 300 residents near the proposed training site, many of whom had been trapped for days without supplies. They also set up a &quot;tent city&quot; for evacuees. On March 7, 2008, Blackwater withdrew its application to set up a facility in San Diego County.

===2007–2009: Blackwater Worldwide===

In October 2007, the month after the Nisour Square massacre, Blackwater USA began the process of changing its name to Blackwater Worldwide and unveiled a new logo. The change deemphasized the &quot;cross hair&quot; reticle theme, simplifying it slightly.

On July 21, 2008, Blackwater Worldwide stated that it would shift resources away from security contracting because of the extensive risks in that sector. Said company founder and CEO Erik Prince, &quot;The experience we&#x27;ve had would certainly be a disincentive to any other companies that want to step in and put their entire business at risk.&quot;

===2009–2010: Xe Services LLC===

In February 2009, Blackwater announced that it would be once again renamed, this time to &quot;Xe Services LLC&quot;, as part of a company-wide restructuring plan, intended to re-focus the company on its logistics, aviation and training aspects, rather than its security operations.

Prince announced his resignation as CEO on March 2, 2009. He remained as chairman of the board but was no longer involved in day-to-day operations. Joseph Yorio was named as the new president and CEO, replacing Gary Jackson as president and Prince as CEO. Danielle Esposito was named the new chief operating officer and executive vice president.

===2010–2014: Academi===
In 2010, Xe was acquired by USTC Holdings, an investor consortium, who sought to further re-brand the company. The sale formally ended Erik Prince&#x27;s operational and management role in the company. Xe was officially renamed &quot;Academi&quot; in 2011. Academi&#x27;s Board of Directors included former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former White House Counsel and Vice Presidential Chief of Staff Jack Quinn, retired Admiral and former NSA Director Bobby Ray Inman, and Texas businessman Red McCombs, who served as chairman of the board. Quinn and Ashcroft were independent directors, without other affiliations to Academi.

In May 2011, Academi named Ted Wright as CEO. Wright hired Suzanne Rich Folsom as Academi&#x27;s chief regulatory and compliance officer and deputy general counsel. The Academi Regulatory and Compliance team won &quot;National Law Journal&quot;&#x27;s 2012 Corporate Compliance Office of the Year Award.

In 2012, retired Brigadier General Craig Nixon was named the new CEO of Academi.

===2014–present: Constellis Holdings===
A merger between Triple Canopy and Academi, along with other companies that were part of the Constellis Group package, are now all gathered under the Constellis Holdings, Inc. umbrella. The transaction brings together an array of security companies including Triple Canopy, Constellis Ltd., Strategic Social, Tidewater Global Services, National Strategic Protective Services, ACADEMI Training Center and International Development Solutions.

In 2015, six Colombian mercenaries reported by local media to be employed by Academi were killed in Yemen.
The mercenaries were being led by an Australian commander believed to have been hired by the United Arab Emirates to fight the Houthi insurgency.

In 2016, Ali al-Houthi, former President of the Revolutionary Committee, a body formed by Houthi militants, reported that a Tochka missile hit on a Saudi-led command center in Ma&#x27;rib resulting in the death of over 120 mercenaries, including 55 Saudi (9 officers), 11 UAE and 11 foreign commanders of Blackwater on January 17 as well as other material losses. Also in 2016, two hundred Sudanese mercenaries from Blackwater and their commander U.S. Colonel Nicolas Petras were killed in Yemen in an attack by Yemeni forces on January 31 with another Tochka missile that impacted a gathering of the Saudi forces at Al Anad Air Base in Lahij province according to Houthi and Iranian sources.

In September 2016, Constellis was bought by Apollo.

Constellis moved their global headquarters to Herndon, Virginia in February 2020.

==Services and products==
Academi has a variety of services and product offerings.

===United States Training Center===

United States Training Center (USTC, formerly Blackwater Training Center) offers tactics and weapons training to military, government, and law enforcement agencies. USTC also offers several open-enrollment courses periodically throughout the year, from hand to hand combat (executive course) to precision rifle marksmanship. They also offer courses in tactical and off-road driving.

USTC&#x27;s primary training facility, located on in northeastern North Carolina, comprises several ranges, indoor, outdoor, urban reproductions, a man-made lake, and a driving track in Camden and Currituck counties. Company literature says that it is the largest training facility in the country. In November 2006, Blackwater USA announced it acquired an facility west of Chicago, in Mount Carroll, Illinois, to be called Blackwater North. That facility has been operational since April 2007 and serves law enforcement agencies throughout the Midwest. The training facility has since been renamed Impact Training Center and then again renamed Hollow Training Center.

In 2011, the Pentagon contracted USTC to provide &quot;intelligence analyst support and material procurement&quot; for NATO in the ongoing Afghan drug war.

====Maritime security service====
Academi offers tactical training for maritime force protection units. In the past, it has trained Greek security forces for the 2004 Olympics, Azerbaijan Naval Sea Commandos, and Afghanistan&#x27;s Ministry of Interior. Academi&#x27;s facilities include a man-made lake, with stacked containers simulating the hull and deck of a ship for maritime assaults. Blackwater received a contract to train United States Navy sailors, which was managed by Jamie Smith, following the attack on the USS Cole. It also purchased a vessel, &quot;McArthur&quot;, which has been outfitted for disaster response and training. According to Blackwater USA, it features &quot;state of the art navigation systems, full GMDSS communications, SEATEL Broadband, dedicated command and control bays, helicopter decks, hospital and multiple support vessel capabilities&quot;. &quot;McArthur&quot; was built in 1966 by the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Company and served as the survey ship USC&amp;GS &quot;McArthur&quot; (MSS 22) for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1966 to 1970, and then as NOAAS &quot;McArthur&quot; (S 330) for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from 1970 until her decommissioning in 2003. The ship is home-ported in Norfolk, Virginia.

====Canine training====
The company trains canines to work in patrol capacities as war dogs, explosives and drug detection, and various other roles for military and law enforcement duties.

====Security consulting====
Blackwater Security Consulting (BSC) was formed as a Delaware LLC in December 2001 and was the brainchild of Jamie Smith, a former CIA officer who was the Founding Director as well as acting Vice President of Blackwater USA. The company, based in Moyock, North Carolina, is one of the private security firms employed during the Iraq War to guard officials and installations, train Iraq&#x27;s new army and police, and provide other support for coalition forces.

The company was started to help train SEALS for combat. However, in the aftermath of 9/11, civilian security teams were needed by the United States Military.

Before 2001, tier-one contractors, or former members of elite, special forces units, were hired from a small pool of applicants. After the September 11 attacks, Cofer Black, the former head of counter terrorism at the CIA, requested that the federal government hire more contractors to operate overseas. Eventually, the CIA realized that a large number of civilian contractors would be needed overseas to accomplish its broad goals. The federal government turned to Blackwater for assistance. Jamie Smith and his deputy David Phillips recruited, vetted and hired a 21-man team. This team was then trained and deployed on a Top Secret project to provide protection for CIA personnel and facilities in Afghanistan. Jamie Smith and Erik Prince deployed with the team to Afghanistan. The two then deployed to the Pakistani border as a two-man element providing security assistance in one of the most dangerous places in the country at the time. Prince stayed there for one week and was in Afghanistan for a total of two weeks, leaving Smith and the remainder of the team to continue to carry out the mission.

By 2003, the ground war in Iraq changed into a diplomatic mission, demanding hundreds of diplomats and State Department employees. The government traditionally handles its own security, but it lacked the staff for high-risk protection details. Therefore, a different type of protection was needed, and Blackwater would provide the solution. Blackwater&#x27;s founder, Erik Prince, says that &quot;not one State Department employee was killed while we were protecting them&quot;.

Academi&#x27;s primary public contract is from the U.S. State Department under the Bureau of Diplomatic Security&#x27;s Worldwide Personal Protective Services (WPPS) and WPPS II umbrella contracts, along with DynCorp International and Triple Canopy, Inc., for protective services in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Israel.

===Products===
====Target systems====
Academi provides and maintains a &quot;shoot house&quot; system and patented the BEAR multi-target training system that was designed and developed by the company. Blackwater Target Systems company was managed by Jim Dehart and the company was largely responsible for keeping Blackwater Training Center financially solvent until the creation of Blackwater Security Company by Smith.

====Cougar (MRAP)====
Force Protection Inc in early 2005 provided the first Cougar Security Vehicle (SV) to Blackwater USA for use as a transport vehicle for U.S. Provisional Coalition Authority officials in Baghdad.

====Grizzly armored vehicle====
Academi operates and markets its own armored personnel carrier, the Grizzly APC.

==Former corporate units==
===Aviation Worldwide Services===
Aviation Worldwide Services (AWS) was founded by Richard Pere and Tim Childrey, and was based at Melbourne, Florida, U.S. It owned and operated three subsidiaries: STI Aviation, Inc. Air Quest, Inc. and Presidential Airways, Inc. In April 2003 it was acquired by Blackwater USA.

Presidential Airways (PAW) is a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulations Part 135 charter cargo and passenger airline based at Melbourne Orlando International Airport. It operates aircraft owned by AWS. Presidential Airways holds a Secret Facility Clearance from the U.S. Department of Defense. It operates several CASA 212 aircraft in addition to a Boeing 767. Several of the MD-530 helicopters used by Blackwater Security Consulting in Iraq are also operated through AWS.

A CASA 212 aircraft, tail number N960BW, operated by Presidential Airways crashed on November 27, 2004, in Afghanistan; it had been a contract flight for the United States Air Force en route from Bagram to Farah. All aboard, three soldiers and three civilian crew members, were killed. Several of their surviving kin filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Presidential in October 2005.

In late September 2007, Presidential Airways received a $92m contract from the Department of Defense for air transportation in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Uzbekistan.

STI Aviation focuses on aircraft maintenance, and is a FAA/Joint Aviation Authorities 145 repair station. They specialize in Short 360, EMB 120, Saab 340, and CASA 212 maintenance. As of January 2008, STI Aviation appears to have been folded into AWS, along with Air Quest.

Many of Blackwater&#x27;s tactical and training aircraft are registered to Blackwater affiliate EP Aviation LLC, named for Blackwater&#x27;s owner, Erik Prince. These aircraft include fourteen Bell 412 helicopters, three Hughes/MD 369 &quot;Little Bird&quot; helicopters, four Bell 214ST medium-lift helicopters, three Fairchild Swearingen Merlin IIIC turboprop airliners, nine Aérospatiale Puma utility helicopters, a Maule Air MT-7-235 STOL aircraft, an Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano counterinsurgency aircraft, and a Mooney M20E fixed wing aircraft.

Aviation Worldwide Services was purchased for $200 million in 2010 by AAR Corp., an Illinois company. In a letter released on February 8, 2011, the new owners informed state officials that they are shutting down the Moyock, North Carolina, operation and moving some employees to a new business location in Melbourne, Florida. Some 260 staff are affected with about 50 losing their jobs, beginning at the end of February. The company views the aviation division as a growth opportunity.

=== Greystone Limited ===
In 2010, Greystone was acquired by current management. Greystone now operates as a standalone, management owned provider of protective support services and training.

A private security service, Greystone is registered in Barbados, and employs soldiers for off-shore security work through its affiliate Satelles Solutions, Inc. Their web site advertises their ability to provide &quot;personnel from the best militaries throughout the world&quot; for worldwide deployment. Tasks can be from very small scale up major operations to &quot;facilitate large scale stability operations requiring large numbers of people to assist in securing a region&quot;.

Erik Prince intended Greystone to be used for peacekeeping missions in areas like Darfur where military operations would need to take place to establish peace.

Greystone had planned to open a training facility on the former grounds of the Subic Bay U.S. Naval Base, but those plans were later abandoned.

==Former international services==

According to a company press release, Blackwater provided airlift, security, logistics, and transportation services, as well as humanitarian support. Blackwater moved about 200 personnel into the area hit by Hurricane Katrina, most of whom (164 employees) were working under a contract with the Department of Homeland Security to protect government facilities, but the company held contracts with private clients as well. Overall, Blackwater had a &quot;visible, and financially lucrative, presence in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina as the use of the company contractors cost U.S. taxpayers $240,000 a day.&quot;

Academi (then Blackwater USA) was one of five companies picked in September 2007 by the Department of Defense Counter-Narcotics Technology Program Office in a five-year contract for equipment, material and services in support of counter-narcotics activities. The contract is worth up to $15 billion. The other companies picked are Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, OHI, and Arinc Inc. Blackwater USA has also been contracted by various foreign governments. The DEA and DoD counternarcotics program is supported by Blackwater Worldwide in Afghanistan as well. &quot;Blackwater is involved on DoD side&quot; of the counter-narcotics program in Afghanistan says Jeff Gibson, vice president for international training at Blackwater. &quot;We interdict. The NIU surgically goes after shipments going to Iran or Pakistan. We provide training to set up roadblocks, identify where drug lords are, and act so as not to impact the community.&quot; In 2008, about 16 Blackwater personnel were in Afghanistan at any given time to support DoD and DEA efforts at training facilities around the country. Blackwater is also involved in mentoring Afghan officials in drug interdiction and counter narcotics. As Richard Douglas, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, explained, &quot;The fact is, we use Blackwater to do a lot of our training of counternarcotics police in Afghanistan. I have to say that Blackwater has done a very good job.&quot;
The Obama administration awarded Academi a $250 million contract to work for the U.S. State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan.

In 2005, Blackwater worked to train the Naval Sea Commando regiment of Azerbaijan, enhancing their interdiction capabilities on the Caspian Sea. In Asia, Blackwater had contracts in Japan guarding AN/TPY-2 radar systems.

In March 2006, Cofer Black, vice chairman of Blackwater USA, allegedly suggested at an international conference in Amman, Jordan, that the company was ready to move towards providing security professionals up to brigade size (3,000–5,000) for humanitarian efforts and low-intensity conflicts. The company denies making this claim.

Mark Manzetti, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on August 19, 2009, reported that the CIA had hired Blackwater &quot;as part of a secret program to locate and assassinate top operatives of Al Qaeda.&quot; Newly appointed CIA director Leon Panetta had recently acknowledged a planned secret targeted killing program, one withheld from Congressional oversight. Manzetti&#x27;s sources, which tied the program to Blackwater, declined to have their names made public. The CIA was acting on a 2001 presidential legal pronouncement, known as a finding, which authorized the CIA to pursue such efforts. Several million dollars were spent on planning and training, but it was never put into operation and no militants were caught or captured. Manzetti notes that it was unknown &quot;whether the C.I.A. had planned to use the contractors to actually capture or kill Al Qaeda operatives, or just to help with training and surveillance in the program.&quot; Jeremy Scahill reported in &quot;The Nation&quot; in November 2009 that Blackwater operated alongside the CIA in Pakistan in &quot;snatch and grab&quot; operations targeting senior members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. The report cited an unnamed source who has worked on covert U.S. military programs, who revealed that senior members of the Obama administration may not be aware that Blackwater is operating under a U.S. contract in Pakistan. A spokesman for Blackwater denied the claims, stating that they have &quot;only one employee in Pakistan.&quot;

== Role in the Iraq War ==

===Contracts===
Blackwater Worldwide played a substantial role during the Iraq War as a contractor for the United States government. In 2003, Blackwater attained its first high-profile contract when it received a $21 million no-bid contract for guarding the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, L. Paul Bremer. Since June 2004, Blackwater has been paid more than $320 million out of a $1 billion, five-year State Department budget for the Worldwide Personal Protective Service, which protects U.S. officials and some foreign officials in conflict zones.

In 2006, Blackwater was awarded a contract to protect diplomats for the U.S. embassy in Iraq, the largest American embassy in the world. It is estimated by the Pentagon and company representatives that there are 20,000 to 30,000 armed security contractors working in Iraq, and some estimates are as high as 100,000, though no official figures exist. Of the State Department&#x27;s dependence on private contractors like Blackwater for security purposes, U.S. ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker told the U.S. Senate: &quot;There is simply no way at all that the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Diplomatic Security could ever have enough full-time personnel to staff the security function in Iraq. There is no alternative except through contracts.&quot;

For work in Iraq, the company has drawn contractors from their international pool of professionals, a database containing &quot;21,000 former Special Forces operatives, soldiers, and retired law enforcement agents,&quot; overall. For instance, Gary Jackson, the firm&#x27;s president, has confirmed that Bosnians, Filipinos, and Chileans &quot;have been hired for tasks ranging from airport security to protecting Paul Bremer, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority.&quot; Between 2005 and September 2007, Blackwater security staff were involved in 195 shooting incidents; in 163 of those cases, Blackwater personnel fired first. Erik Prince points out that the company followed the orders of United States government officials, who frequently put his men in harm&#x27;s way. Many of the shootings occurred after drivers in vehicles failed to stop when ordered by Blackwater guards.

According to former CIA director Michael Hayden, Blackwater, among other security contractors, were allowed to perform waterboarding on suspects. Leaks in 2009 suggest CIA - Blackwater contracts to assassinate al-Qaeda leaders.

===Fallujah and Najaf===
On March 31, 2004, Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah ambushed two SUVs, killing the four armed Blackwater contractors inside. Local residents hung the charred bodies above a bridge across the Euphrates. In response, U.S. Marines attacked the city in &quot;Operation Vigilant Resolve&quot;, which became the first Battle of Fallujah. In the fall of 2007, a congressional report by the House Oversight Committee found that Blackwater intentionally &quot;delayed and impeded&quot; investigations into the contractors&#x27; deaths. The report also acknowledges that members of the now-defunct Iraqi Civil Defense Corps &quot;led the team into the ambush, facilitated blocking positions to prevent the team&#x27;s escape, and then disappeared.&quot; Intelligence reports concluded that Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi was the mastermind behind the attack, and he was captured after a Navy SEAL special operation in 2009. al-Isawi was ultimately handed over to Iraqi authorities for trial and executed by hanging some time before November 2013.

In April 2004, at the U.S. government&#x27;s headquarters in Najaf, hundreds of Shiite militia forces barraged Blackwater contractors, four MPs and a Marine gunner with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 fire for hours before U.S. Special Forces troops arrived. As supplies and ammunition ran low, a team of Blackwater contractors away flew to the compound to resupply and bring an injured U.S. Marine back to safety outside of the city.

===Nisour Square Massacre===

The Iraqi Government revoked Blackwater&#x27;s license to operate in Iraq on September 17, 2007, after a massacre in Nisour Square, Baghdad in which Blackwater contractors were later convicted of killing 17 Iraqi civilians. The deaths occurred while a Blackwater Private Security Detail (PSD) was escorting a convoy of U.S. State Department vehicles en route to a meeting in western Baghdad with United States Agency for International Development officials. The license was reinstated by the American government in April 2008, but in early 2009 the Iraqis announced that they had refused to extend that license. In 2009, FBI investigators were unable to match the bullets from the shooting to those guns carried by Blackwater contractors, leaving open the possibility that insurgents also fired at the victims. In a 2010 interview, Erik Prince, the company&#x27;s founder, said the government is looking for dirt to support what he dismissed as &quot;baseless&quot; accusations that run the gamut from negligence, racial discrimination, prostitution, wrongful death, murder, and the smuggling of weapons into Iraq in dog-food containers. He pointed out that current and former executives have been regularly deposed by federal agencies. Prince argued in September 2007 that there was a &quot;rush to judgment&quot; about Blackwater, due to &quot;inaccurate information.”

===Other incidents===
On February 16, 2005, four Blackwater guards escorting a U.S. State Department convoy in Iraq fired 70 rounds into a car. The guards stated that they felt threatened when the driver ignored orders to stop as he approached the convoy. The fate of the car&#x27;s driver was unknown because the convoy did not stop after the shooting. An investigation by the State Department&#x27;s Diplomatic Security Service concluded that the shooting was not justified and that the Blackwater employees provided false statements to investigators. The statements claimed that one of the Blackwater vehicles had been hit by insurgent gunfire, but the investigation concluded that one of the Blackwater guards had actually fired into his own vehicle by accident. John Frese, the U.S. embassy in Iraq&#x27;s top security official, declined to punish Blackwater or the security guards because he believed any disciplinary actions would lower the morale of the Blackwater contractors.

On February 6, 2006, a sniper employed by Blackwater Worldwide opened fire from the roof of the Iraqi Justice Ministry, killing three guards working for the state-funded Iraqi Media Network. Many Iraqis at the scene said that the guards had not fired on the Justice Ministry. The U.S. State Department said, however, that their actions &quot;fell within approved rules governing the use of force&quot; based on information obtained from Blackwater guards.

On April 21, 2005, six Blackwater USA independent contractors were killed in Iraq when their Mil Mi-8 Hip helicopter was shot down. Also killed were three Bulgarian crewmembers and two Fijian gunners. Initial reports indicated that the helicopter was shot down by rocket propelled grenades or missile fire.

In 2006, a car accident occurred in the Baghdad Green Zone when an SUV driven by Blackwater USA contractors crashed into a U.S. Army Humvee. &quot;The colonel ... said the Blackwater guards disarmed the soldiers and forced them to lie on the ground at gunpoint until they could disentangle their vehicles.&quot;

On December 24, 2006, a security guard of the Iraqi vice president, Adel Abdul Mahdi, was shot and killed while on duty outside the Iraqi prime minister&#x27;s compound. The Iraqi government has accused Andrew J. Moonen, a Blackwater employee at the time, of killing him while drunk. Moonen was subsequently fired by Blackwater for &quot;violating alcohol and firearm policy&quot;, and travelled from Iraq to the United States days after the incident. The DOJ investigated and announced in 2010 that they were declining to prosecute Moonen, citing a likely affirmative defense of self-defense and high standards for initiating such a prosecution. The United States State Department and Blackwater USA had attempted to keep his identity secret for security reasons.

In 2007, the U.S. government investigated whether Blackwater employees smuggled weapons into Iraq. No charges were filed.

Five Blackwater contractors were killed on January 23, 2007, in Iraq when their Hughes H-6 helicopter was shot down on Baghdad&#x27;s Haifa Street. The crash site was secured by a personal security detail, callsign &quot;Jester&quot; from 1/26 Infantry, 1st Infantry Division. Three insurgents claimed to be responsible for shooting down the helicopter, although this has not been confirmed by the United States. A U.S. defense official has confirmed that four of the five killed were shot execution style in the back of the head, but did not know whether the four had survived the crash.

In late May 2007, Blackwater contractors opened fire on the streets of Baghdad twice in two days, one of the incidents provoking a standoff between the security contractors and Iraqi Interior Ministry commandos, according to U.S. and Iraqi officials. The first incident occurred when a Blackwater-protected convoy was ambushed in downtown Baghdad. The following incident occurred when an Iraqi vehicle drove too close to a convoy. However, according to incident testimony, the Blackwater guards tried to wave off the driver, shouted, fired a warning shot into the car&#x27;s radiator, finally shooting into the car&#x27;s windshield. On May 30, 2007, Blackwater employees shot an Iraqi civilian said to have been &quot;driving too close&quot; to a State Department convoy that was being escorted by Blackwater contractors. Following the incident, the Iraqi government allowed Blackwater to provide security by operating within the streets of Iraq.

On August 21, 2007, Blackwater Manager Daniel Carroll threatened to kill Jean Richter, a U.S. State Department Investigator, in Iraq. In June 2014, a New York Times investigation reported that it had secured an internal State Department memo stating this. Richter later returned from Iraq to the U.S. and wrote a scathing review of the lax standards to which Blackwater was held accountable, only two weeks before a serious Blackwater incident in which 17 Iraqi civilians were shot and killed by Blackwater employees under questionable circumstances. The death threat incident was confirmed by a second investigator, a Mr. Thomas, who was also present at the meeting. The shooting incident that followed has been described by some as a &quot;watershed&quot; moment, and a factor which contributed to Iraq&#x27;s later decision to refuse to allow U.S. troops to stay beyond 2011.

Documents obtained from the Iraq War documents leak of 2010 argue that Blackwater employees committed serious abuses in Iraq, including killing civilians.

===Prosecution===
====U.S. Congress====
On October 2, 2007, Erik Prince attended a congressional hearing conducted by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform following the controversy related to Blackwater&#x27;s conduct in Iraq and Afghanistan. Blackwater hired the public relations firm BKSH &amp; Associates Worldwide, a subsidiary of Burson-Marsteller, to help Prince prepare for his testimony at the hearing. Robert Tappan, a former U.S. State Department official who worked for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, was one of the executives handling the account. Burson-Marsteller was brought aboard by McDermott Will &amp; Emery and Crowell &amp; Moring, the Washington law firms representing Blackwater. BKSH, a self-described &quot;bipartisan&quot; firm (Hillary Clinton, when pursuing the Democratic presidential nomination, was also a client), is headed by Charlie Black, a prominent Republican political strategist and former chief spokesman for the Republican National Committee, and Scott Pastrick, former treasurer of the Democratic National Committee.

In his testimony before Congress, Prince said his company has a lack of remedies to deal with employee misdeeds. When asked why Andrew Moonen had been &quot;whisked out of the country&quot; after the shooting death of the vice-presidential guard, he replied, &quot;We can&#x27;t flog him, we can&#x27;t incarcerate him.&quot; When asked by a member of Congress for financial information about his company, Prince declined to provide documentation, saying &quot;we&#x27;re a private company, and there&#x27;s a key word there – private.&quot; Later he stated that the company could provide it at a future date if questions were submitted in writing. When the term &quot;mercenaries&quot; was used to describe Blackwater employees, Prince objected, characterizing them as &quot;loyal Americans.&quot;

A staff report compiled by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on behalf of Representative Henry Waxman questioned the cost-effectiveness of using Blackwater forces instead of U.S. troops. Blackwater charges the government $1,222 per day per guard, &quot;equivalent to $445,000 per year, or six times more than the cost of an equivalent U.S. soldier,&quot; the report alleged. During his testimony on Capitol Hill, Erik Prince disputed this figure, saying that it costs money for the government to train a soldier, to house and feed them, they don&#x27;t just come prepared to fight. &quot;That sergeant doesn&#x27;t show up naked and untrained,&quot; Prince stated. Moreover, he pointed out that Blackwater&#x27;s employees are trained in special operations and exceed the capabilities of the average soldier.

In the wake of Prince&#x27;s testimony before Congress, the U.S. House amended the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act in October 2007. The new legislation, H.R.2740 - the MEJA Expansion and Enforcement Act of 2007, expanded the original scope to MEJA to encompass all security contractors working overseas, not only those working under the Department of Defense. This subsequently led to the prosecution by U.S. courts of some U.S. military contractors, but only for incidents involving attacks on U.S. nationals. The legal status of Blackwater and other security firms in Iraq was a subject of contention. Two days before he left Iraq, L. Paul Bremer signed &quot;Order 17&quot; giving all Americans associated with the CPA and the American government immunity from Iraqi law. A July 2007 report from the American Congressional Research Service indicates that the Iraqi government still has no authority over private security firms contracted by the U.S. government. On October 5, 2007, the State Department announced new rules for Blackwater&#x27;s armed guards operating in Iraq. Under the new guidelines, State Department security agents will accompany all Blackwater units operating in and around Baghdad. The State Department will also install video surveillance equipment in all Blackwater armored vehicles, and will keep recordings of all radio communications between Blackwater convoys in Iraq and the military and civilian agencies that supervise their activities.

In December 2008, a U.S. State Department panel recommended that Xe should be dropped as the main private security contractor for U.S. diplomats in Iraq.

On January 30, 2009, the State Department told Blackwater Worldwide that it will not renew its contract in Iraq. However, in 2010 it was awarded a $100 million contract from the CIA.

Regardless of these developments, Xe defended its work in Iraq. A company spokeswoman stated: &quot;When the US government initially asked for our help to assist with an immediate need to protect Americans in Iraq, we answered the call and performed well. We are proud of our success – no-one under our protection has been killed or even seriously wounded.&quot;

In August 2010, the company agreed to pay a $42 million fine to settle allegations that it unlawfully provided armaments and military equipment overseas. However, the company is still allowed to accept government contracts. The settlement and fine conclude a U.S. State Department investigation that began in 2007.

====Iraqi courts====
On September 23, 2007, the Iraqi government said that it expects to refer criminal charges to its courts in connection with the Blackwater shootings. However, on October 29, 2007, immunity from prosecution was granted by the U.S. State Department, delaying a criminal inquiry into the September 16 shootings of 17 Iraqi civilians. Immediately afterwards, the Iraqi government approved a draft law to end any and all immunity for foreign military contractors in Iraq, to overturn Order 17. The U.S. Department of Justice also said any immunity deals offered to Blackwater employees were invalid, as the department that issued them had no authority to do so. It is unclear what legal status Blackwater Worldwide operates under in the U.S. and other countries, or what protection the U.S. extends to Blackwater Worldwide&#x27;s operations globally. A number of Iraqi families took Blackwater to court over alleged &quot;random killings committed by private Blackwater guards&quot;.

Legal specialists say that the U.S. government is unlikely to allow a trial in the Iraqi courts, because there is little confidence that trials would be fair. Contractors accused of crimes abroad could be tried in the United States under either military or civilian law; however, the applicable military law, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, was changed in 2006, and appears to now exempt State Department contractors that provide security escorts for a civilian agency. Prosecution under civilian law would be through the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which allows the extension of federal law to civilians supporting military operations; however, according to the deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department&#x27;s criminal division, Robert Litt, trying a criminal case in federal court would require a secure chain of evidence, with police securing the crime scene immediately, while evidence gathered by Iraqi investigators would be regarded as suspect.

The Iraqi government announced that Blackwater must leave Iraq as soon as a joint Iraqi–U.S. committee finishes drafting the new guidelines on private contractors under the current Iraqi–U.S. security agreement. On January 31, 2009, the U.S. State Department notified Blackwater that the agency would not renew its security contract with the company. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reported on March 17, 2009, that the U.S. State Department had extended its Iraq security contract with Blackwater&#x27;s air operations arm, Presidential Airways, to September 3, 2009, for a cost of $22.2 million.

On January 31, 2010, three current and former U.S. government officials confirmed the Justice Department is investigating whether officials of Blackwater Worldwide tried to bribe Iraqi government officials in hopes of retaining the firm&#x27;s security work in Iraq after the shooting in Nisour Square in Baghdad, which left 17 Iraqis dead and stoked bitter resentment against the United States. The officials said that the Justice Department&#x27;s fraud section opened the inquiry late in 2009 to determine whether Blackwater employees violated a federal law banning American corporations from paying bribes to foreign officials. In 2012 the Department of Justice closed the investigation without filing any charges.

====Lawsuits====
In the March 2004 court case &quot;Helvenston et al. v. Blackwater Security&quot;, Blackwater was sued by the families of four contractors killed in Fallujah. The families said they were suing not for financial damages, but for the details of their sons&#x27; and husbands&#x27; deaths, saying that Blackwater had refused to supply these details, and that in its &quot;zeal to exploit this unexpected market for private security men,&quot; the company &quot;showed a callous disregard for the safety of its employees.&quot; On February 7, 2007, four family members testified in front of the House Government Reform Committee. They asked that Blackwater be held accountable for future negligence of employees&#x27; lives, and that federal legislation be drawn up to govern contracts between the Department of Defense and defense contractors. Blackwater then countersued the lawyer representing the empty estates of the deceased for $10 million on the grounds the lawsuit was contractually prohibited from ever being filed. In January 2011, U.S. district judge James C. Fox dismissed the suit.

On November 27, 2004, an aircraft operated by Presidential Airways and owned by its sister company, Blackwater AWS, crashed in Afghanistan; it had been a contract flight for the United States Air Force en route from Bagram to Farah. Three soldiers and three civilian crew members aboard the plane were killed. Several relatives of the victims filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Presidential in October 2005.

On October 11, 2007, the Center for Constitutional Rights filed suit against Blackwater under the Alien Tort Claims Act on behalf of an injured Iraqi and the families of three of the 17 Iraqis killed by Blackwater employees during the September 16, 2007, Blackwater Baghdad shootings. The suit, &quot;Abtan v. Blackwater&quot;, alleged that Blackwater had engaged in war crimes, created a &quot;culture of lawlessness&quot;, and routinely deployed employees who used steroids and other psychoactive drugs.

In June 2009, an amended lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleging that Blackwater employees shot and killed three members of an Iraqi family, including a nine-year-old boy, who were traveling from the Baghdad airport to Baghdad on July 1, 2007. The suit further accused Blackwater employees of murder, weapons smuggling, money laundering, tax evasion, and child prostitution. Two affidavits filed as part of the suit by former employees accuse Blackwater of encouraging the murder of Iraqi civilians, and of murdering or having murdered employees who intended to testify against the company. The lawsuit was ultimately settled confidentially in 2010, with plaintiffs accepting cash payments from the company.

====Federal prosecution====
In August 2012, the company agreed to pay $7.5 million in fines, without admitting guilt, to the U.S. government to settle various charges involving pre-Academi personnel. February 2013, the majority of the remaining charges were dropped when it was shown that, in many cases, the Blackwater employees had been acting under the orders of the U.S. government. Once the court decision had been finalized, Academi pointed out that &quot;[t]he court decision involves former Blackwater executives, none of whom have ever worked for ACADEMI or the current ownership.&quot;

After the Nisour Square killings of 17 Iraqi civilians and the injury of 20 more by Blackwater convoy guards in a Baghdad traffic circle in September 2007, charges were brought against five guards. One pleaded guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for his testimony for the prosecution. Three were eventually convicted in October 2014 of 14 manslaughter charges and in April 2015 sentenced to 30 years plus one day in prison. These sentences were deemed unfair upon appeal and these three await resentencing. Another was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison; however, this verdict was overturned in August 2017.

On December 22, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned four former Blackwater contractors serving long prison terms: Nicholas Slatten, Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard. The pardons do not establish innocence; however, they were criticised, both in the U.S. and in Iraq, as condoning killing of innocent civilians.

<text>Lyta Alexander [Lyta pronounced as: (/lit/ LEE-tah)] is a fictional character portrayed by Patricia Tallman in the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. 

==Role in &quot;Babylon 5&quot;==
===Character arc===
In the series&#x27; pilot, Lyta is described as a sixth generation telepath, but she points out that telepathy may have been running undetected in her family even earlier since telepaths were not monitored before that generation. In the series, it is stated that Lyta was trained by the Psi Corps and that she briefly interned with the Psi Cops division. After an incident while accompanying Alfred Bester, she transfers to commercial work. In 2257, she is assigned as Babylon 5&#x27;s first commercial telepath. Soon after she arrives at the station, she scans Vorlon Ambassador Kosh, in violation of the wishes of the Vorlon government, in order to try to discover the identity of his attacker.

In season 2, Lyta&#x27;s experience with the Vorlon ambassador permanently changes her, but many of the characters are being altered, including Babylon 5&#x27;s commander. Lyta, the telepath, is recalled from her assignment a few weeks later and is questioned regarding her encounter with Kosh. She gets interrogated for months by the Psi Corps, she eventually escapes and joins the Mars Resistance. While underground, she uncoveres information regarding a mole among the Babylon 5 command staff. She returns to the station in late 2259, where she reveals Talia Winters as an unwitting mole for secret forces in EarthGov and Psi Corps.

In season 3, Lyta travels to the Vorlon homeworld, one of the few known humans to do so and live. There, she gets modified by the Vorlons and is given gill-like implants to allow her to breathe in a Vorlon environment and the ability to &quot;carry&quot; a Vorlon consciousness. This tremendously increases her telepathic and psychokinetic powers beyond what she herself can realize. She returns to Babylon 5 as an aide to Ambassador Kosh.

In season 4, Lyta is key to the eventual resolution of the Shadow War on Coriana 6, serving as the vessel through which Sheridan and Delenn confront the elder races and forces them to leave the galaxy. Immediately after the Shadow War, she becomes part of the expedition to the Shadows&#x27; homeworld of Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum. Using unknown abilities and implanted instructions from the Vorlons, she triggers the destruction of the planet to spite Alfred Bester and prevents Shadow technology from falling into the wrong hands. However, after the conclusion of the Shadow War, she finds herself unwelcome and having difficulty finding employment. She goes on to play a decisive role in the endgame of the Earth Civil War, triggering the shadow-modified telepaths smuggled aboard Earth ships to disable the fleet at Mars.

In season 5, Alexander becomes romantically involved with Byron, revealing to the telepaths that they had been created by the Vorlons as weapons for their war with the Shadows. After Byron&#x27;s death, Alexander gets inspired by his cause to create a homeworld for telepaths, and becomes the leader of a movement sponsoring violent resistance against the Corps. Lyta also begins to more thoroughly explore the abilities the Vorlons had given her. She eventually gets arrested aboard Babylon 5 for supporting terrorism by John Sheridan. Michael Garibaldi makes a deal with her to help her avoid prosecution and provide funding for her cause. Former Narn Ambassador G&#x27;Kar takes her with him on a mission of exploration.

=== Characterization ===

The character of Lyta Alexander has been subject to literary analysis, for example, in the dimension of feminine identity. 

== Conceptual history ==
Lyta was introduced in the pilot episode &quot;The Gathering&quot; as a telepath assigned to the Babylon 5 space station by the Psi Corps, a fictional organization providing support to telepaths and monitoring their activity. However, she did not appear in the remainder of season 1 due to a dispute concerning Tallman&#x27;s salary. Lyta&#x27;s role was largely taken up by Andrea Thompson, who was cast as Talia Winters, a telepath who took over Lyta&#x27;s responsibilities at the station. After Thompson left the series due to disagreements regarding the amount of screen time given to her character, Lyta returned as a recurring character in seasons 2 and 3 after Capt. John Sheridan took over as station commander and became a regular cast member from season 4 on. Her character simply resumed the dramatic arc once intended for Thompson&#x27;s.

Lyta does not appear in any of the canonical materials released since the end of the series. It is strongly implied in &quot;Crusade&quot; and some of the canonical novels that her actions (both on Babylon 5 in 2262 and afterward) led to the Telepath War of the mid-2260s, in which she was killed. According to Straczynski, Lyta was intended to appear in the &quot;Crusade&quot; episode &quot;The Path of Sorrows&quot; as part of a flashback, but Tallman&#x27;s salary negotiations failed. The scene featured an unnamed telepath who died striking against the Psi Corps. Whether or not this was meant to be Lyta, Straczynski confirmed that she died in such an attack. In the aforementioned script book, Straczynski wrote that both Lyta and Lennier were killed in the explosion of Psi Corps Headquarters in a major battle of the Telepath War. Hints about her death had also been given by Straczynski in posts to the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; newsgroup. and in the final novel of the Psi Corps Trilogy by J. Gregory Keyes

<text>Urinalysis, a portmanteau of the words &quot;urine&quot; and &quot;analysis&quot;, is a panel of medical tests that includes physical (macroscopic) examination of the urine, chemical evaluation using urine test strips, and microscopic examination. Macroscopic examination targets parameters such as color, clarity, odor, and specific gravity; urine test strips measure chemical properties such as pH, glucose concentration, and protein levels; and microscopy is performed to identify elements such as cells, urinary casts, crystals, and organisms.
==Background==

Urine is produced by the filtration of blood in the kidneys. The formation of urine takes place in microscopic structures called nephrons, about one million of which are found in a normal human kidney. Blood enters the kidney though the renal artery and flows through the kidney&#x27;s vasculature into the glomerulus, a tangled knot of capillaries surrounded by Bowman&#x27;s capsule. The glomerulus and Bowman&#x27;s capsule together form the renal corpuscle. A healthy glomerulus allows many solutes in the blood to pass through, but does not permit the passage of cells or high-molecular weight substances such as most proteins. The filtrate from the glomerulus enters the capsule and proceeds to the renal tubules, which reabsorb water and solutes from the filtrate into the circulation and secrete substances from the blood into the urine in order to maintain homeostasis.

The first destination is the proximal convoluted tubule. The filtrate proceeds into the loop of Henle, then flows through the distal convoluted tubule to the collecting duct. The collecting ducts ultimately drain into the renal calyces, which lead to the renal pelvis and the ureter. Urine flows through the ureters into the bladder and exits the body through the urethra. 

Besides excreting waste products, the process of urine formation helps to maintain fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance in the body. The composition of urine reflects not only the functioning of the kidneys, but numerous other aspects of the body&#x27;s regulatory processes. The ease with which a urine sample can be obtained makes it a practical choice for diagnostic testing.

==Medical uses==
Urinalysis involves assessment of the physical properties of urine, such as color and clarity; chemical analysis using urine test strips; and microscopic examination. Test strips contain pads impregnated with chemical compounds that change color when they interact with specific elements in the sample, such as glucose, protein and blood, and microscopic examination permits the counting and classification of solid elements of the urine, such as cells, crystals, and bacteria. 

Urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed medical laboratory tests. It is frequently used to help diagnose urinary tract infections and to investigate other issues with the urinary system, such as incontinence. It may be used to screen for diseases as part of a medical assessment. The results can suggest the presence of conditions such as kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes. In emergency medicine urinalysis is used to investigate numerous symptoms, including abdominal and pelvic pain, fever, and confusion. During pregnancy, it may be performed to screen for protein in the urine (proteinuria), which can be a sign of pre-eclampsia, and bacteria in the urine, which is associated with pregnancy complications. The analysis of urine is invaluable in the diagnosis and management of kidney diseases.

==Specimen collection==
Samples for urinalysis are collected into a clean (preferably sterile) container. The sample can be collected at any time of the day, but the first urine of the morning is preferred because it is more concentrated. To prevent contamination, a &quot;midstream clean-catch&quot; technique is recommended, in which the genital area is cleaned before urinating and the sample is collected partway through the urination. Samples can also be collected from a urinary catheter or by inserting a needle through the abdomen and into the bladder (suprapubic aspiration). In infants and young children, urine may be collected into a bag attached to the genital region, but this is associated with a high risk of contamination. If the sample is not tested promptly, inaccurate results can occur because bacteria in the urine will multiply and elements such as cells and casts will degrade. It is recommended that urinalysis is performed within two hours of sample collection if the urine is not refrigerated.

==Macroscopic examination==
===Color and clarity===
Normal urine has a yellow hue, which is primarily caused by the pigment urochrome. The color can range from pale yellow to amber based on the individual&#x27;s hydration status. Urine can develop a variety of abnormal colors, which may suggest disease in some cases. A total lack of color indicates that the urine is extremely dilute, which may be caused by excessive fluid intake, diabetes insipidus, or diabetes mellitus. Dark yellow-brown to green urine may suggest a high concentration of bilirubin, a state known as bilirubinuria. Red urine often indicates the presence of red blood cells or hemoglobin, but can also be caused by some medications and the consumption of foods containing red pigments, such as beets. Myoglobin, a product of muscle breakdown, can give urine a red to reddish-brown color. Dark brown or black urine can occur in a genetic disorder called alkaptonuria and in people with melanoma. Purple urine occurs in purple urine bag syndrome.

A spectrum of abnormal colors can result from the intake of drugs. An unusually bright yellow color can occur after consumption of B vitamin supplements, while phenazopyridine, used to treat urinary tract-related pain, can turn the urine orange. Methylene blue may turn it blue to bluish-green. Phenolphthalein, a stimulant laxative previously found in Ex-Lax, can produce colors ranging from red to purple, and levodopa, used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease, may result in &quot;cola-colored&quot; urine.

The clarity of urine is also recorded during urinalysis. Urine is typically clear; materials such as crystals, cells, bacteria, and mucus can impart a cloudy appearance. A milky appearance can be caused by a very high concentration of white blood cells or fats, or by chyluria (the presence of lymphatic fluid in the urine). Unpreserved urine will become cloudier over time.

===Smell===

The odor (scent) of urine can normally vary from odorless (when very light colored and dilute) to a much stronger odor when the subject is dehydrated and the urine is concentrated. Transient changes in urine odor can occur after consuming certain foods, most notably asparagus. The urine of diabetics experiencing ketoacidosis (urine containing high levels of ketone bodies) may have a fruity or sweet smell, while urine from individuals with urinary tract infections often has a foul smell. Some inborn errors of metabolism cause characteristic odors, such as maple syrup urine disease (which takes its name from the urine scent) and phenylketonuria (which causes a &quot;mousey&quot; smell). Odor is rarely reported during urinalysis.

===Specific gravity===
Specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of the urine, which provides information about hydration status and kidney function. It normally ranges from 1.003 to 1.035; lower values indicate that the urine is dilute, while higher values mean that it is concentrated. A urine specific gravity that consistently remains around 1.010 (isosthenuria) can indicate kidney damage, as it suggests that the kidneys have lost the ability to control urine concentration. It is not possible for the kidneys to produce urine with a specific gravity greater than 1.040 but such readings can occur in urine that contains high-molecular weight substances, such as contrast dyes used in radiographic imaging. Specific gravity is commonly measured with urine test strips, but refractometers may also be used. Reagent strip readings are based on the concentration of ions in the sample, while refractometer readings are affected by other substances such as glucose and protein.

==Urine test strip==
Urine test strips or &quot;dipsticks&quot; allow for the rapid measurement of numerous urine parameters and substances. The strip is dipped into the urine sample and the color changes on the reagent pads are read after a defined period of time, either by eye or using an automated instrument. The tests included vary depending on the type of dipstick, but common ones are glucose, ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen, blood, white blood cells (leukocyte esterase), protein, nitrite, pH, and specific gravity. Nitrite is reported as negative or positive; other elements may be scored on a scale or reported as an approximate concentration based on the intensity of the color change.

False positive and false negative results may occur. General sources of error include abnormally colored urine, which interferes with the interpretation of color changes; high levels of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), which can cause false negative results for blood, bilirubin, glucose, and nitrite; and variations in the concentration of the sample.

===Blood===
Reagent pads for blood change color in the presence of heme groups, which catalyze the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with the color indicator in the test strip. Heme groups are found in hemoglobin, but also in myoglobin (a product of muscle breakdown). Thus, a positive result for blood can represent the presence of red blood cells (hematuria), free hemoglobin (hemoglobinuria), or myoglobin (myoglobinuria). Red blood cells can sometimes be distinguished from free hemoglobin or myoglobin as the former causes a speckled pattern on the test pad while the latter results in a uniform color change.

===White blood cells===
Leukocyte esterase, an enzyme found in granulocytes, is measured to estimate the concentration of white blood cells. The action of the enzyme on chemicals in the test pad ends in the creation of a purple azo dye. False positive results can occur if the sample is contaminated with vaginal secretions; false negatives can occur in very concentrated samples or those containing high levels of glucose and protein. Elevated white blood cell counts in urine generally indicate infection or inflammation. People with a low level of neutrophils in the blood (neutropenia) may not have enough white blood cells in their urine to produce a positive reaction.

===Nitrite===
Some bacteria that cause UTIs can reduce urinary nitrates to nitrites. The presence of nitrites, which causes a pink color on the reagent strip pad, therefore acts as an indicator of urinary tract infection. The nitrite test is quite specific, meaning that someone is likely to have a UTI if it is positive, but it is not sensitive; a negative result does not reliably indicate that the subject does not have a UTI. Not all bacteria that cause UTIs produce nitrite, and because it takes time for the chemical reaction to occur, the test is best performed on urine that has been in the bladder overnight. A diet low in vegetables can lead to low nitrate levels in the urine, meaning that nitrites cannot be produced. False positive results can occur in samples that are contaminated or stored improperly, allowing bacteria to multiply.

===Protein===
Test strips estimate urine protein levels by exploiting the ability of protein to interfere with pH indicators. The reagent pad contains an indicator that is buffered to a pH of 3, which changes from yellow to green in the presence of protein. Trace levels of protein in the urine can be normal, but high levels (proteinuria) can indicate kidney disease. Most cases of proteinuria are caused by increased levels of albumin, which test strips can detect relatively well; but they are markedly less sensitive to other proteins, such as Bence-Jones protein, which may occur in multiple myeloma. Because the test pad reaction is dependent on pH, false positive results can occur if the urine is highly alkaline. Conventional test strips are not sensitive enough to reliably detect microalbuminuria, a condition in which urine albumin levels are slightly elevated, although dipsticks specialized for this measurement exist.

===pH===
pH indicators are used to measure the pH of the sample. Urine pH varies with diet and a wide range of values occur in healthy subjects, although it is most commonly slightly acidic. Because the kidneys are involved in regulating acid-base balance, the urine is typically acidic in people with metabolic or respiratory acidosis and alkaline in those with alkalosis. However, in renal tubular acidosis, the urine pH remains alkaline while the blood is acidic. During urinary tract infections, waste products of bacterial metabolism can cause the urine to become alkaline. Urine pH may be monitored to help prevent the formation of kidney stones or to avoid side effects of some drugs, such as high-dose methotrexate therapy, in which crystals that cause kidney damage can form if the urine is acidic. If microscopy is performed, knowing the pH of the sample helps to identify any crystals that might be present.

===Specific gravity===
Urine test strips use the concentration of ions in the urine to estimate specific gravity. The test pad contains a polyelectrolyte that releases hydrogen ions in proportion to the concentration of ions in the sample. The consequent pH change is measured using a pH indicator. The reading obtained from reagent strips, as opposed to refractometers, is not affected by substances such as glucose, urea and contrast dyes. Falsely low readings can occur in alkaline urine.

===Glucose===
Test strips for glucose contain the enzyme glucose oxidase, which breaks down glucose and forms hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct. In the presence of a peroxidase enzyme, hydrogen peroxide reacts with a chromogen to induce a color change. The presence of glucose in the urine is known as glycosuria. In people with normal blood sugar levels, the amount of glucose in the urine should be negligible as it is reabsorbed by the renal tubules. High blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) cause excess glucose to spill over into the urine and result in a positive reading. This characteristically occurs in diabetes mellitus (although it is not part of the formal diagnostic criteria). Glycosuria may occur in people with normal blood sugar levels during pregnancy or due to dysfunction of the renal tubules (termed renal glycosuria).

===Ketones===

Ketone bodies are products of fat breakdown. When the body relies on fats, rather than carbohydrates, as its main energy source, increased levels of ketones occur in the blood and urine. The presence of detectable levels of ketones in the urine is called ketonuria. Ketones occur in three forms in the body: beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetone and acetoacetate. Test strips use sodium nitroprusside to detect acetoacetate, and those with a glycine additive can detect acetone; however, none detect BHB. The reaction of ketones with sodium nitroprusside in an alkaline medium turns the test pad purple.

Ketonuria occurs in uncontrolled type 1 diabetes and in diabetic ketoacidosis. Ketonuria can also occur when the body&#x27;s demand for carbohydrates outpaces dietary intake, such as in people following a ketogenic diet, people experiencing severe vomiting or diarrhea, and during starvation or after strenuous exercise. Mild ketonuria can be normal during pregnancy. Some medications, such as levodopa or methyldopa, can cause a false positive result.

===Bilirubin===
Bilirubin is a waste product formed from the breakdown of hemoglobin. Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system digest aged red blood cells and release unconjugated bilirubin into the bloodstream, which is converted to water-soluble conjugated bilirubin by the liver. Conjugated bilirubin is normally stored in the gallbladder as a constituent of bile and is excreted through the intestines; it does not occur at detectable levels in the urine.

The presence of bilirubin in the urine (termed bilirubinuria) occurs as a consequence of high blood levels of conjugated bilirubin in liver disease or bile duct obstruction. Bilirubin is detected by means of reaction with a diazonium salt that forms a colored complex. With prolonged light exposure, bilirubin converts to biliverdin and becomes undetectable by reagent strips.

===Urobilinogen===
Urobilinogen refers to a group of compounds produced from bilirubin by the intestinal flora. Under normal conditions, most of the urobilinogen produced is absorbed into the bloodstream and secreted into the bile by the liver, or excreted in the feces as stercobilin and other compounds. A small fraction is excreted in the urine.

Urine urobilinogen is increased in liver disease and hemolytic jaundice (jaundice due to increased destruction of red blood cells); in the latter case, urine bilirubin is typically negative. In bile duct obstruction, urine bilirubin increases but urobilinogen is normal or decreased, as bilirubin cannot reach the intestines to be converted to urobilinogen. Testing methods are based on the Ehrlich reaction of urobilinogen with &quot;para&quot;-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, or interaction with a diazonium compound to produce a colored product. Test strips that use Ehrlich&#x27;s reagent can give false positive results in the presence of porphobilinogen and numerous drugs. Decreased levels of urobilinogen cannot be detected by the dipstick method. Like bilirubin, urobilinogen is sensitive to light.

==Microscopic examination==

Microscopic examination of the urine allows cells and elements such as urinary casts to be identified and counted. This can yield a great detail of information and may suggest a specific diagnosis. Microscopy is not always included in urinalysis: it may be reserved for samples that have abnormal results on preliminary testing or that are from certain patient populations, such as infants. Results that typically require microscopic examination include abnormal color or clarity and positive dipstick results for blood, leukocytes, nitrite, or protein.

If microscopy is necessary, the urine may be centrifuged to concentrate the solid elements so that they can be viewed more easily. In this case, a drop of the concentrated sample is placed under a coverslip and examined, typically at 100x and 400x magnification. The microscopic components of urine are reported according to the amount present in the microscope&#x27;s field of view at low magnification (reported as /lpf, meaning low-power field) and high magnification (/hpf for high-power field). Some elements, such as crystals or bacteria, are typically reported in a format, using terms such as &quot;few&quot; or &quot;many&quot; or grades from 1+ to 4+. Others, such as cells or casts, are reported using numerical ranges. If it is necessary to determine the exact number of cells or casts in the sample, unconcentrated urine can be placed in a counting chamber called a hemocytometer. In this case, the results are reported per microliter (/μL). Urine is traditionally examined by light microscopy, but some laboratories use phase-contrast microscopes, which improve the visualization of elements such as urinary casts and mucus. Urine can also be stained before analysis to make its components easier to identify.

There are automated microscopy systems that use flow cytometry technology or pattern recognition to identify microscopic elements in unconcentrated urine. Automated instruments reduce workload in medical laboratories and can accurately identify most common urinary elements, but do not perform as well with unusual findings such as transitional and renal epithelial cells, abnormal casts and rare crystals.

Elements that can be observed on microscopic examination include:

===Red blood cells===

Under the microscope, normal red blood cells (RBCs) appear as small concave discs. Their numbers are reported per high-power field. In highly concentrated urine they may shrivel and develop a spiky shape, which is termed &quot;crenation&quot;, while in dilute urine they can swell and lose their hemoglobin, creating a faint outline known as a &quot;ghost cell&quot;. A small quantity of red blood cells in the urine is considered normal.

An increased level of RBCs is termed hematuria. Microscopic hematuria is sometimes observed in healthy people after exercise or as a consequence of contamination of the sample with menstrual blood. Pathologic causes of hematuria are diverse and include trauma to the urinary tract, kidney stones, urinary tract infections, drug toxicity, genitourinary cancers, and a variety of other renal and systemic diseases. Abnormally shaped red blood cells with blob-like protrusions of the cell membrane, called dysmorphic RBCs, are thought to represent damage to the glomerulus.

===White blood cells===
Typically, most white blood cells (WBCs) in urine are neutrophils. They are round, larger than RBCs, possess a cell nucleus, and have a granular appearance. A few white blood cells can normally be found in the urine of healthy individuals; females tend to have slightly more than males. An increased number of WBCs is termed pyuria or leukocyturia and is associated with infection or inflammation of the urinary tract. WBCs can also appear in the urine following exercise or fever. An increased number of eosinophils (eosinophiluria) can occur in acute interstitial nephritis and chronic UTIs. Cytocentrifugation and staining of the urine sample is necessary to reliably distinguish eosinophils from neutrophils.

===Epithelial cells===

Epithelial cells form the lining of the urinary tract. Three types may occur in urine: squamous epithelial cells, transitional epithelial cells and renal tubular epithelial cells. Some laboratories do not distinguish between the three types of cells and simply report &quot;epithelial cells&quot; in general.

Squamous epithelial cells line the urethra, as well as the vagina and the outer layer of the skin. They are very large, flat, and thin, with irregular borders and a single, small nucleus. They may fold into various shapes. They are not considered clinically significant, but if they are seen in large numbers they can indicate contamination of the sample by vaginal secretions or the skin of the urogenital area.

Transitional epithelial cells, also known as urothelial cells, line the urinary tract from the renal pelvis through the ureters and bladder and, in males, the upper (proximal) portion of the urethra. They are smaller than squamous cells and their shape varies based on the layer of epithelium from which they are derived, but they are most commonly round or pear-shaped. They may have one or two nuclei. Small numbers of these cells are found in normal urine; larger numbers can be seen after invasive procedures like catheterization or cystoscopy or in conditions that irritate the urinary tract, such as urinary tract infections. In the absence of recent trauma to the urinary tract, clusters and sheets of transitional cells in the urine may indicate malignancy, requiring further investigation.

Renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEs) line the collecting ducts and the distal and proximal tubules of the kidney. They can be difficult to identify in unstained urine, as they look similar to urothelial cells and WBCs; however, they are generally larger than WBCs and smaller than urothelial cells, and collecting duct cells, unlike urothelial cells, often have a flat edge. The presence of RTEs in high numbers is a significant finding, as this indicates damage to the renal tubules. This may occur in conditions such as acute tubular necrosis, drug or heavy metal toxicity, acute glomerulonephritis, kidney transplant rejection, trauma, and sepsis.

===Casts===

Urinary casts are cylindrical structures composed of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. Their shape derives from the renal tubules where they are formed, and the protein base can incorporate cells or other material. Hyaline casts contain only protein and can be found in low numbers in healthy people; their numbers may increase transiently after exercise or dehydration. Persistently increased numbers are seen in many renal diseases. They are almost transparent and can be difficult to see using light microscopy.

Granular casts, so named for their microscopic appearance, incorporate degenerated cellular material or protein aggregates. They are considered an abnormal finding and are associated with diseases of the kidney although they can rarely occur in healthy individuals, particularly following strenuous physical activity. Large, dense casts with cracked edges, called waxy casts, are traditionally associated with chronic kidney failure, though little evidence exists to support this. Red blood cell casts incorporate intact RBCs and are a serious finding because under normal conditions, RBCs cannot pass through the glomerulus into the renal tubules. These casts are characteristically found in people with glomerular diseases such as acute glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis. White blood cell casts represent infection or inflammation involving the kidneys; they can occur in pyelonephritis, but are absent in lower urinary tract infections. Following injury to the renal tubules, renal tubular epithelial cell casts may be seen in the urine. Casts may incorporate a variety of other materials such as bacteria, yeast, crystals, and pigments like bilirubin or myoglobin.

===Crystals===
Various compounds in the urine can precipitate to form crystals. Crystals can be identified based on their appearance and the pH of the urine (many types preferentially form at an acidic or alkaline pH). Crystals that can be found in normal urine include uric acid, monosodium urate, triple phosphate (ammonium magnesium phosphate), calcium oxalate, and calcium carbonate. Crystals can also appear as poorly defined aggregates of granular material, termed amorphous urates or amorphous phosphates (urates form in acid urine while phosphates form in alkaline urine). These are of no clinical significance, but they can interfere with microscopy by obscuring other elements (especially bacteria). Some drugs, such as sulfonamides, may form crystals when excreted in the urine, and ammonium biurate crystals commonly occur in aged samples.

The presence of crystals in the urine has conventionally been associated with the formation of kidney stones, and crystalluria is more common in people with kidney stones than those without. However, crystalluria occurs in up to 20% of the normal population, so it is not a reliable diagnostic marker. Some types of crystals are characteristically associated with disease states. Leucine and tyrosine crystals may be observed in liver disease, and cystine crystals indicate cystinuria (although they look identical to hexagonal variants of uric acid crystals, and can only be distinguished with further testing). Cholesterol crystals may rarely be seen in nephrotic syndrome and chyluria.

===Organisms===

Microorganisms that can be observed in the urine include bacteria, yeast and &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;. The urine of children with pinworm infections may contain &quot;Enterobius vermicularis&quot; eggs, and &quot;Schistosoma haematobium&quot; ova may be detected in urine samples from individuals with parasitic infestations.

===Other elements===
Mucus can occur in the urine, where it appears as translucent wavy strands under the microscope. The presence of mucus is not a clinically significant finding, but it can be confused with hyaline casts. Sperm may occasionally be observed in the urine of both males and females; in female children and vulnerable adults, this can indicate sexual abuse. Reporting the presence of sperm in human urine (spermaturia), especially in women,is a controversial topic. Fat droplets and oval fat bodies may be present in a condition called lipiduria, which has various causes, most notably nephrotic syndrome. Contaminants from the outside environment, such as starch granules, hair, and clothing fibers, may be seen but are not reported.

==Interpretation==

The interpretation of urinalysis takes into account the results of physical, chemical and microscopic examination and the person&#x27;s overall condition. Urine test results should always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test, or using information provided by the test strip/device manufacturer. Not all abnormal results signify disease, and false positive results are common. For this reason, the use of urinalysis for screening in the general population has been discouraged, but it remains a common practice.

Urinalysis is commonly used to help diagnose urinary tract infections, but the significance of the results depends on the broader clinical situation. In the setting of UTI symptoms, positive dipstick results for nitrite and leukocyte esterase are strongly suggestive of a UTI, but negative results do not rule it out if there is a high degree of suspicion. When the dipstick test is positive, microscopy is used to confirm and count WBCs, RBCs and bacteria and assess for possible contamination (signified by a high number of squamous epithelial cells in the sample). If UTI is suspected, particularly in complicated cases or when urinalysis results are inconclusive, a urine culture may be performed to identify microorganisms if present, obtain a colony count, and carry out antibiotic sensitivity testing. The colony count helps to distinguish between contamination and infection.

If a significant quantity of bacteria is present in the urine but there are no symptoms of a UTI, the condition is called asymptomatic bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in elderly people and in those with long-term urinary catheters, and in most cases does not require treatment. Exceptions include pregnant women, in whom bacteriuria is associated with poorer pregnancy outcomes, and people undergoing some invasive urology procedures.

A positive dipstick result for blood could signify the presence of red blood cells, hemoglobin, or myoglobin, and therefore requires microscopic analysis for confirmation. Intact red blood cells will normally be observed under the microscope if present, but they may lyse in dilute or alkaline samples. Hemoglobinuria, if unaccompanied by a high quantity of RBCs, can signify intravascular hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells inside the body). Myoglobinuria occurs in rhabdomyolysis and other conditions that cause breakdown of muscle tissue.

If red blood cells are present, the interpretation takes into account whether the urine is visibly bloody (termed macroscopic hematuria) or if RBCs are only seen on microscopy (microscopic hematuria). Contamination of the sample with blood from a non-urinary source, such as from menstruation or rectal bleeding, can mimic hematuria, and microscopic hematuria is sometimes observed in healthy people after exercise. Other causes of microscopic hematuria include UTI, kidney stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and trauma to the urinary tract. Kidney diseases that affect the glomerulus can cause microscopic hematuria, in which case it is referred to as glomerular hematuria. On urine microscopy, the presence of abnormally shaped (&quot;dysmorphic&quot;) red blood cells and RBC casts is associated with glomerular hematuria. Proteinuria and elevated blood creatinine alongside hematuria suggests kidney dysfunction. In people at risk, persistent microscopic hematuria can be a sign of urinary tract cancer and may require further testing, such as urinary tract imaging and cystoscopy. Sometimes no cause can be identified, and the condition is managed with regular monitoring. The causes of macroscopic hematuria are similar, but in the absence of an obvious explanation such as trauma or UTI, it is more strongly associated with malignancy and requires further investigation.

Elevated levels of protein in the urine are often suggestive of kidney disease, but may have other causes. Proteinuria can occur transiently as a consequence of exercise, fever, stress, or UTI. Proteinuria that occurs only while standing, called orthostatic proteinuria, is relatively common in young men and not associated with disease. In multiple myeloma, Bence-Jones protein may be secreted into the urine, although this type of proteinuria is not as easily detected by urine dipsticks. If proteinuria is persistently detected by dipstick testing, a 24-hour urine collection can be performed to obtain an accurate measurement of protein levels; alternatively, protein excretion can be estimated from the urine protein/creatinine ratio of a single specimen. Measuring the amount of protein in the urine helps to distinguish between different causes of proteinuria. Urine protein electrophoresis, which identifies and measures the proportions of different types of protein in the urine, may be used to investigate the cause of proteinuria and to detect Bence-Jones protein. During pregnancy, dipstick testing may be used to screen for proteinuria as it is a sign of pre-eclampsia.

==History==

The diagnostic value of urine has been recognized since ancient times. Urine examination was practiced in Sumer and Babylonia as early as 4000 BC, and is described in ancient Greek and Sanskrit texts. Hippocrates, Celsus and Galen published important works correlating the characteristics of urine with patients&#x27; health. During the Middle Ages the visual inspection of urine―termed uroscopy—gained widespread popularity. The 7th-century manuscript &quot;De Urinis&quot; by the Byzantine physician Theophilus Protospatharius is thought to be the earliest publication dedicated solely to the examination of urine. Protospatharius notably described a method for precipitating protein out of urine using heat.

Many influential works on urine testing followed. Publications by Isaac Judaeus built upon Protospatharius&#x27; work, and Zayn al-Din Gorgani, an 11th-century Persian physician, published instructions for specimen collection which noted that urine samples were affected by aging and exposure to heat and light. Other medieval writers included Gilles de Corbeil, who published a popular mnemonic poem on uroscopy and introduced the matula, a round flask used to examine urine; and Joannes Actuarius, who wrote a series of books on uroscopy in seven volumes. The 1491 book &quot;Fasciculus Medicinae&quot;, published by Johannes de Ketham, became popular with laypeople and was used for self-diagnosis. The matula came to symbolize the practice of medicine in general.

Physicians of antiquity interpreted the color of urine using circular charts listing correspondences with disease states. The relation of urine characteristics to disease was based on the theory of the four humors. Different areas of the matula flask were thought to represent different organs and regions of the human body. In the 16th century, Paracelsus applied the principles of alchemy to the study of urine. He believed that materials obtained from distillation and precipitation of the urine could provide diagnostic information. In this respect he could be regarded as a progenitor of biochemical methods for urinalysis.

During the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the abuse of uroscopy by disreputable individuals began to draw criticism. &quot;Uromancers&quot; without medical training claimed that they could not only diagnose disease, but detect pregnancy, determine a baby&#x27;s sex, and even predict the future from a subject&#x27;s urine. In 1637 the English physician Thomas Brian published &quot;The Pisse-Prophet, or, Certaine Pisse-Pot Lectures&quot;, excoriating those who claimed to be able to diagnose diseases by uroscopy without examining the patient.

The 19th century saw a proliferation in chemical methods for the analysis of urine, but these techniques were labor-intensive and impractical; in one contemporary editorial a physician complained about the dangers of keeping nitric acid (used to detect albumin) in one&#x27;s pocket. A search for more convenient techniques ensued. An early method resembling urine test strips was devised by the French chemist in 1850. Maumené impregnated a strip of wool with tin(II) chloride, added a drop of urine, and exposed it to a flame. If the urine contained glucose, the wool would turn black. In the 1880s William Pavy developed powdered reagents for urinalysis, and George Oliver introduced &quot;Urinary Test Papers&quot; for albumin and glucose, which were a commercial success and were marketed in Germany as well as the United Kingdom. From 1900 onwards there was a proliferation of commercial reagent kits for urinalysis. Beginning in the 1920s, the chemist Fritz Feigl developed highly sensitive methods for spot testing on filter paper, which paved the way for modern urine test strips. Feigl also introduced the method of protein detection using the protein error of indicators, which is still used today.

In 1956 Helen Murray Free and her husband developed Clinistix (also known as Clinistrip), the first dip-and-read test for glucose in urine for patients with diabetes. This breakthrough led to additional dip-and-read tests for other substances. The invention was named a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in May 2010. A dipstick test for urine protein, called Albustix, was introduced by Miles Laboratories in 1957, and the first multi-test dipsticks were released in 1959. Automated test strip readers came onto the market in the 1980s.

<text>William Robinson Clark (26 March 1829 – 12 November 1912) was a Scottish-Canadian theologian.

==Biography==
Clark was born in Daviot, Aberdeenshire, son of Rev. James Clark. Originally educated for the Congregationalist ministry at New College London, he later conformed to the Church of England. After graduating from King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen MA with honours, he went to Hertford College, Oxford. Foster&#x27;s &#x27;Alumni Oxonienses&#x27; indicates that his BA was conferred by Oxford in 1864 and his MA in 1865.

Immediately after leaving New College, London he became minister of the Congregational Church at Lymington, Hampshire. He entered the Church of England in 1856, a fact attributed by his former tutor William Farrer (1820–1908) to the influence of Clark&#x27;s wife. He was the Curate of St Matthias, Birmingham, 1857–1858, and then the Dean of Taunton and prebendary of Wells Cathedral from 1859 to 1880. He was frequently selected to preach in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.

In 1882, aged about 53, he emigrated to Canada and became the Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy at Trinity College, Toronto, Ontario (from 1883 to 1908). He was noted as a lecturer and preacher. He was also Professor of Theology at Toronto University. He resigned his chair in the college in 1909, after occupying it for twenty-five years. From that date to the time of his death he held the title of Emeritus Professor and as such he sat ex officio on the Council of Trinity College.

In recognition of his services to the Church and to education he was created a Canon of St. Alban&#x27;s Cathedral, the Cathedral Church of St. James (Toronto), by the third Bishop of Toronto, Arthur Sweatman. Among these services was the help he rendered in the formation of the General Synod of the Church of England in Canada, in 1893.

He was described as one of the foremost theologians in North America, and there are records of him delivering lectures in Michigan. Amongst honours and distinctions which were bestowed upon him by institutions of learning were the degrees of D.C.L., conferred by Trinity College Toronto ; D.D., conferred by Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston ; and LL.D., conferred by Hobart College, Geneva, USA - now part of the Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 1888 ; his appointment by the University of Michigan as Baldwin Lecturer in 1887, and as Slocum Lecturer in 1889 ; his appointment as Honorary Professor of Hobart College, Geneva, (USA) in 1888. He was eminent in the councils of the Church of England in Canada.

He became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. He was elected in 1891 and later served as President of the Society from 1899 – 1900. It seems that he was involved in the formation of the Empire Club of Canada, and became President of the Empire Club of Canada 1905 – 1906.

In Canada, he also became a close friend of the long-time Prime Minister and political figure, William Lyon Mackenzie King (1874–1950), who was also of Scottish descent, and the Reverend William Robinson Clark is referred to in the Archives of Canada.

Following his death, the Corporation of Trinity College, at its annual meeting on 21 November 1912, adopted a resolution recording the great debt of gratitude 
it owed to Professor Clark. The resolution proceeded to say : —

&quot;As a Preacher and public Lecturer, Professor Clark was very highly esteemed, and his many engagements in these capacities served to make Trinity College favourably known far and near. He showed remarkable versatility and brilliancy in his work, both in the class room and on the public platform, as well as in his literary productions, which embrace Theology, History, and Literature. Dr. Clark&#x27;s singular devotion to Trinity College and the great ability with which he served it, entitle him to the lasting regard of all its supporters, while his inexhaustible human sympathy and kindness of heart ensure for him the grateful and affectionate remembrance of a host of friends.&quot;

<doc id="568010" wikidata="Q4103206" url="?curid=568010" title="One timer">
<text>In ice hockey, a one-timer is a shot that occurs when a player meets a teammate&#x27;s pass with an immediate slapshot, without any attempt to control the puck on their stick. An effective one-timer requires precise timing on the part of both players involved, especially the shooter. This play improves the shooter&#x27;s chances at scoring a goal. A wrist shot can also be done on a one-timer, though the puck is released far slower than a slapshot one-timer.

The effectiveness of the one-timer comes from three things:

# The angle from goal between the pass and the shot
# The change of direction of the puck
# The speed of the puck after the shot

Greater angle, change of direction and/or speed increases the chances of the puck going into the net.
Lesser angle, change of direction and/or speed decreases the chance of the puck going into the net.

Either way, the one-timer enjoys a greater success rate than a one-on-one shot between shooter and goalie.

The reason it is called a one-timer is that the player has only one time to connect.

<doc id="568011" wikidata="Q7055840" url="?curid=568011" title="North Korean abductions of South Koreans">
<text>An estimated 84,532 South Koreans were taken to North Korea during the Korean War. In addition, South Korean statistics claim that, since the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953, about 3,800 people have been abducted by North Korea (the vast majority in the late 1970s), 489 of whom were still being held in 2006.

==Terminology==
South Korean abductees by North Korea are categorized into two groups, wartime abductees and post-war abductees.

===Wartime abductees===
Koreans from the south who were kidnapped to the north against their wishes during the 1950–53 Korean War and died there or are still being detained in North Korea are called wartime abductees or Korean War abductees. Most of them were already educated or skilled, such as politicians, government officials, scholars, educators, doctors, judicial officials, journalists, or businessmen. According to testimonies by remaining family members, most abductions were carried out by North Korean soldiers who had specific names and identification in hand when they showed up at people&#x27;s homes. This is an indication that the abductions were carried out intentionally and in an organized manner.

===Post-war abductees===
South Koreans who were kidnapped by North Korean agents in the South Korean territory or foreign countries after the armistice was signed in 1953 are known as post-war abductees. Most of them were captured while fishing near the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), but some were abducted by North Korean agents in South Korea. North Korea continued to abduct South Koreans into the 2000s, as is shown by the cases of the Reverend Kim Dong-shik (), who was abducted on January 16, 2000, and Jin Gyeong-suk (), a North Korean defector to South Korea who was abducted on August 8, 2004, when she had returned to the China-North Korea border region using her South Korean passport.

==Background==
During wartime, North Korea kidnapped South Koreans to increase its human capacity for rehabilitation after the war. It recruited intelligentsia who were exhausted in North Korea and kidnapped those needed for post-war rehabilitation, technical specialists, and laborers. There was an intention to drain the intelligentsia of South Korean society, exacerbate societal confusion, and promote communization of South Korea by making post-war rehabilitation difficult due to the shortage of technical specialists and youth. They also had the intention to guise the abductions as voluntary entry for the advancement of their political system.

In his &quot;Complete Works, Volume IV&quot;, dated July 31, 1946, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung wrote: &quot;In regards to bringing Southern Chosun&#x27;s intelligentsia, not only do we need to search out all Northern Chosun&#x27;s intelligentsia in order to solve the issue of a shortage of intelligentsia, but we also have to bring Southern Chosun&#x27;s intelligentsia.&quot;

In the case of post-war abductees, Yoichi Shimada, a Fukui University professor in Japan, states that North Korea appeared to abduct foreign citizens to:
# eliminate witnesses who happened to run into North Korean agents in action
# steal victims&#x27; identities and infiltrate agents back into the countries concerned
# force abductees to teach their local language and customs to North Korean agents
# brainwash them into secret agents; the fishermen hardly had access to valuable intelligence, but they still could be trained as spies and sent back to the South
# use abductees&#x27; expertise or special skills
# use abductees as spouses for unusual residents in North Korea, especially lone foreigners such as defectors or other abductees

These six patterns are not mutually exclusive. Especially numbers 2, 3, and 4 derive from Kim Jong Il&#x27;s secret order of 1976 to use foreign nationals more systematically and thereby improve the quality of North Korean spy activities, contributing to his &quot;localization of spy education.&quot;

Further, better-educated people could be employed by the institutions responsible for waging propaganda campaigns against the South in, say, their broadcast facilities.

== North Korea&#x27;s position about the abduction issue ==
North Korea has shown different positions on the abduction issue.

Regarding the alleged abduction of Japanese nationals, on September 17, 2002, the North Korean Government officially admitted to the kidnapping of 13 Japanese citizens at a meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

As for the South Korean abduction issue, North Korea has consistently claimed that there are no South Korean abductees in North Korea. After the Armistice in 1953, North Korea refused the release of South Korean wartime abductees despite a provision allowing civilian abductees to return home in Article III of the Korean War Armistice Agreement, a document signed by representatives from the United States, North Korea, and China. Instead, North Korea only returned 19 foreigners to the South.

In regards to the post-war abductees, North Korea insists that the South Koreans defected to North Korea, and remain there of their own free will, but refuses to allow South Korean relatives to communicate with them. Despite the testimonies of former abductees who have escaped from the North on their own, North Korea has held fast to the existing position: &quot;There are no South Korean abductees and we cannot confirm their existence.&quot; The former husband of Japanese abductee Megumi Yokota, himself a suspected abductee from the South, was allowed to meet his South Korean mother in 2006, but Yokota&#x27;s parents called the meeting a publicity stunt by North Korea, meant to isolate his daughter from her Japanese family, as the man has now remarried a native North Korean and has a son with her.

== Inter-Korean talks held ==
The Seoul government has clarified that resolving the Korean War POW and abductee issue is not only part of the Korean government&#x27;s basic responsibility for protecting its citizens but one of the highest priorities. But despite the South Korean government&#x27;s official urging for the North Korean government to deal with the abduction issue, there have been no substantial results so far. Since the inter-Korean Summit held in 2000, the South and the North dealt with the abduction issue at the talks; the second South–North Summit, inter-Korean Prime Minister talk, and rounds of ministerial-level or inter-Korean Red Cross talks.

* On June 15, 2000, at the first South–North Summit, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, agreed to settle humanitarian issues as early as possible, including the exchange of visiting groups of separated families and relatives. But from the words and phrases of their agreement, or June 15th North–South Joint Declaration, there were no references to the abductee issue.
** In the same year, South Korea repatriated 63 convicted Communist spies and thereafter provided billions of dollars&#x27; worth of aid and trade to the North. But it has been reluctant to challenge North Korea&#x27;s denials that it had abducted any South Koreans — even though Kim Jong Il admitted in 2002 that North Korea had kidnapped thirteen Japanese citizens and released five.
* On June 24, 2005, at the fifteenth round of Inter-Korean Ministerial Talks held in Seoul, the South and the North agreed to hold the sixth round of inter-Korean Red Cross talks to consult about humanitarian issues including confirmation of the fates and whereabouts of the missing people during Korean War.
** During the sixth round of inter-Korean Red Cross talks held in August 2005, the South and the North discussed the issue of confirming the fates and whereabouts of missing people during the Korean War but produced no concrete results.
* During the eighth round of inter-Korean Red Cross talks held in April 2007, both Koreas agreed on &quot;the framework of family reunion meetings&quot;, cooperating and addressing the issue regarding those who have been missing &quot;during or after&quot; the Korean War. It seemed to be a more realistic approach but also showed that North Korea was still refusing to admit any cases of abduction of South Koreans.
* At the second South–North Summit, on October 4, 2007, Roh Moo-hyun raised the prisoners of war (POW) and abduction issue to Kim Jong Il, but he failed to achieve a settlement because Kim Jong Il did not respond.
* First inter-Korean PM talks in November 2007 and ninth round of inter-Korean Red Cross talks (in November 2007) reconfirmed the agreement of 8th round of Red Cross talks.

== Substitution way: including the category of separated families ==
Because North Korea has been denying the existence of abductees and POWs on its territory, since November 2000, the South Korean government has been trying to resolve the issue through a more realistic approach of including the abductees and POWs in the category of separated families. By doing so, families of POWs or abductees also could participate in the normal reunion events that were organized for families separated by the war.
As a result of these efforts, a total of 38 families of abductees and POWs were able to meet their family members in North Korea, and the fates of 88 people were confirmed.

In contrast with the official policies, the 2014 United Nations &quot;Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the DPRK&quot; states that the South Korean government has not been willing to raise the issue with North Korea, thinking of the abductions in political rather than humanitarian terms. Further, the report says that &quot;Well over 200,000 persons who were taken from other countries to the DPRK may have potentially become victims of enforced disappearance, as defined in the Declaration for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance&quot; and &quot;Most post-war abductee family members that have applied to attend a separated family reunion have received notification at the life status verification stage of the process, that their loved one has since deceased or their life status cannot be verified. Given the high level of surveillance on those of South Korean origin, and the nature of DPRK monitoring in society in general, from the Inmin-wiwon-oei (regional level) down to the Inminban (Neighbourhood Watch), the Commission finds it difficult to believe that life status verification is not possible in the DPRK.&quot;

== The law concerning abductees ==
Separately from talks with North Korea, the South Korean government enacted on April 2, 2007, the &quot;Law for the Victims of Abduction to the North in the Post-War Years (or, the law concerning the assistance and compensation for the abducted persons since the Korean War Armistice Agreement)&quot;. Based on this law, the abducted persons, upon return to South Korea, will be entitled to receive assistance and, together with their family members, will be entitled to compensation for the human rights infringements sustained during the period. By this law, on October 16, 2007, the South Korean government formed the &quot;Committee for the Compensation of the Victims of Abduction to the North.&quot;

== Number of abductees ==

=== Wartime abduction ===
Owing to the special situation of wartime, the exact number of Korean War abductees is difficult to determine. There are considerable differences in the numbers cited in various published documents and statistics. Overall range of the numbers is from 2,438 to 84,532. When the Korean National Red Cross set a special re-registration period to compile a list of missing people or the so-called &quot;displaced people&quot; in 1956, a total of 7,031 people registered. On February 26, 1957, the South delivered the list of 7,034 people to the North through the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC). But according to the survey of &quot;Korean War Abductees&#x27; Family Union&quot; in March 2002, its number amounts to 94,700.

=== Post-war abduction ===
After the Korean War or during the Cold War period, a total of 3,795 people have been abducted and taken to North Korea. Subsequently, through the South Korean government&#x27;s protests and various efforts via the Korean National Red Cross, 3,309 people have returned to South Korea. And six persons have recently escaped from the North and returned to the South Korea on their own. A total of 480 South Korean abductees remain in North Korea against their will (as of December 2007).
Below chart shows status of abducted persons by year.
== Major abduction cases ==

=== Status of abducted and detained persons===

=== Fishermen ===
On May 28, 1955, a South Korean fishing boat, the &quot;Daesung-ho&quot;, with a crew of ten fishermen, was hijacked by North Korean authorities. Since then, North Korean agents have hijacked numerous South Korean ships and kidnapped the seamen and fishermen aboard the vessels. In total, 3,696 fishermen and 120-plus fishing boats were seized by North Korea.

After strong protests from South Korean government, North Korea has repatriated 3,262 fishermen. An additional six fishermen have returned home to South Korea on their own between 2000 and 2007. But a total of 427 fishermen are still held in North Korea.

===High school students===
Five South Korean high school students disappeared in 1977 and 1978. They had been regarded as missing people. But in the late 1990s, through the testimonies of North Korean spies in South Korea, it was discovered that they were working in North Korea as instructors, teaching the basics of South Korean lifestyle to would-be undercover Northern operatives. It has been known that among them was the husband of Japanese abductee Yokota Megumi, Kim Young-nam.

=== South Korean Navy personnel ===
On June 5, 1970, North Korean patrol boats seized a South Korean broadcast vessel with 20 crew on board off the west coast near the military demarcation line. The vessel was standing guard for South Korean fishing boats.

=== Korean Air Lines airplane hijacking ===

In December 1969, North Korean agents hijacked a South Korean airliner YS-11 to Wonsan en route from Kangnung to Seoul with 51 persons aboard; in February 1970, 39 of the crew and passengers were released. The remaining 11 were still detained in North Korea. Eventually, two stewardesses became announcers of the North Korean propaganda broadcasts that target South Korean audiences.

=== Abductions abroad ===

In February 1978, South Korean actress Choi Eun-hee and her film director husband Shin Sang-ok were kidnapped in Hong Kong and taken to Pyongyang. They were abducted on the orders of Kim Jong Il, the son of North Korean President Kim Il Sung, who wanted to use them to improve the North Korean film industry. Shin attempted to escape and spent five years in a re-education camp, before being reunited with his wife. While living in North Korea, Shin made the monster movie &quot;Pulgasari&quot;. In April 1984, South Korean government officials stated that the kidnappees were working in North Korea producing propaganda films that glorified Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. The couple escaped to the United States in 1986 while on a filming assignment in Vienna.

In the 1990s most abductions of this sort took place in China, and their victims were political activists, missionaries, and real or suspected South Korean spies. All these abductions occurred in the Chinese North-East, near the borders of North Korea.
* In January 2000, South Korean, Reverend Kim Dong-shik, a legal resident of the United States, was reported missing in Yanji, northeastern China. Kim is reported to have been actively involved since 1995 in evangelical work among North Korean escapees/refugees in Yanji, Jilin Province, China. In October 2000, South Korea&#x27;s National Intelligence Service reportedly confirmed that Kim was kidnapped by North Koreans in Yanbian, China, on February 1, 2000. In April 2005, the Seoul Central District Court convicted Chinese citizen Ryu Young-hwa of assisting North Korean agents in the abduction of Kim.
* In July 1995, a team of three North Korean agents and their two Korean-Chinese collaborators in Jilin abducted a South Korean pastor, Reverend Ahn Seung-woon, in southern Manchuria. Pyongyang claimed that Ahn defected voluntarily. But a Chinese court convicted a North Korean citizen of masterminding the abduction of Ahn and deported the agent to North Korea in July 1997 following a two-year prison term.

North Korean abductions have not been limited to northeast Asia and many documented abductees have been kidnapped while abroad, making the issue of serious concern to the international community.
* On April 5, 1971, Yu Sung-gun, a South Korean diplomat stationed at the South Korean embassy in West Germany, was abducted by North Koreans while in West Berlin.
* In June 1979, North Korean agents abducted South Korean teacher Ko Sang-moon in Norway, who had taken a taxi and stated his destination was &quot;Embassy of Korea&quot; but the driver took him to the embassy of the wrong country.
* In August 1987, Lee Chae-hwan, a South Korean student enrolled in the United States at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was abducted by North Koreans while on a visit to Austria.

<doc id="568014" wikidata="Q483109" url="?curid=568014" title="Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union">
<text>The Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union (KTU, ), also known as Jeongyojo (; acronym for &quot;KTU&quot; in Korean language), is a labor union of teachers in South Korea. The organization has 77,000 members (down from 94,000) among the 360,000 public and private school teachers in the country.

==History==
The KTU was founded in 1989 under opposition from the South Korean government. In response to its founding, several thousand members were subsequently fired by the education authorities. The KTU finally received official recognition in 1999 after the election of Kim Dae-Jung and many of the dismissed teachers were allowed to return to their former positions.

A major contributor to the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the KTU has been criticized by conservative media outlets for promoting pro-North Korea ideology.

By 2009, the KTU&#x27;s ranks had dwindled, possibly due to parental and public opposition to its non-education-related political activities. A series of scandals also deeply undermined the union&#x27;s credibility, including the attempted cover-up of a sexual assault on one of its members, as well as the sexual harassment of trainee teachers by KTU members.

In July 2009, the KTU&#x27;s offices were raided by police on charges of issuing an anti-government statement allegedly in violation of the Civil Servants Law and the Educational Workers Labor Union Act, which bans political activities for teachers&#x27; unions on matters unrelated to working conditions. Union officials protested the investigation for being politically motivated. Per request by the KTU, the Education International, a multinational federation of teachers&#x27; unions, protested the investigations in a formal letter.

In April 2010, New Right politician Cho Jun-hyuk revealed the list of teachers who are affiliated with the KTU. This has led to a series of court decisions against him. This has later backfired as the KTU sought to file compensations against him.

In February 2011, the Seoul Metropolitan Education Board approved two KTU-affiliated school principals that caused controversies in their admission process.

In May 2011, KTU sued Gyeonggi-do regional politician Bak Gwang-jin, for releasing a list of teachers affiliated with the KTU.

On May 16, 2011, the head of a conservative parents&#x27; interest group &quot;Gyohakyeon&quot; (교육과 학교를 위한 학부모 연합) sent letters to approximately 60,000 KTU-affiliated teachers &quot;to resign their affiliation with KTU&quot;.

On December 9, 2011, the Incheon District Court released an official statement that the decision made by the Superintendent of Incheon Metropolitan Office of Education to penalize KTU-affiliated teachers for donating &quot;illegal&quot; funding to the Democratic Labor Party is unconstitutional.

==Oppositions==
The South Korean Parents&#x27; Association for Reviving Public Education is a well-known opposition group against the KTU.

<doc id="568016" wikidata="Q2639494" url="?curid=568016" title="Penalty shot (ice hockey)">
<text>In ice hockey, a penalty shot is a type of penalty awarded when a team loses a clear scoring opportunity on a breakaway because of a foul committed by an opposing player. A player from the non-offending team is given an attempt to score a goal without opposition from any defending players except the goaltender. This is the same type of shot used in a shootout to decide games in some leagues.

==Award==

A penalty shot is awarded to a player who is deemed to have lost a clear scoring chance on a breakaway by way of a penalty infraction by an opposing player. A breakaway, in this case, means that there are no other players between the would-be shooter and the goaltender of the defending team. Generally, the penalty shot is awarded in lieu of what would normally be a minor penalty, so the fouled team will not get both a penalty shot and a power play from a single infraction, even if they did not score on the former.

According to National Hockey League (NHL) rules, various infractions during a breakaway that can lead to a penalty shot being awarded include a goaltender deliberately dislodging a goal-post (delay of game), a defending player using a stick or any other part of his body to interfere with the attacking player, a goaltender or other player throwing his stick to distract or hinder the attacking player, or any other foul committed against the attacking player from behind. In addition to this, a penalty shot is awarded to the opposing team if a non-goalie player intentionally covers the puck in his own team&#x27;s goal crease.

In the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL), since its inception in 2004, a penalty shot is automatically awarded for a minor penalty in the final two minutes of overtime. This rule was slightly changed prior to the 2008–09 season when the SPHL changed their overtime rules, shortening minor penalties in overtime to one minute. Now any infraction occurring in the final minute of overtime will result in a penalty shot. This rule only applies to regular season games. 

Upon observing any of the above scenarios, an official will signal a penalty shot by raising his crossed arms above his head with his fists clenched, and then point to centre ice. In the NHL, officials signal a penalty shot by just pointing to centre ice. A player is then picked to take the shot. This is usually (though not always) the player who was fouled on the preceding play. In some cases, the captain of the attacking team may pick a player from those on the ice at the time of the infraction. Only a goaltender or alternate goaltender may be selected to defend the penalty shot, although the original goaltender usually stays in the net.

According to NHL rules, if an infraction which would usually attract a penalty shot occurs while the defending team&#x27;s goaltender is off the ice (i.e. an empty net scenario), a goal shall be awarded.

==Procedure==
Following the announcement of the penalty shot, the official places the puck at centre ice. The identified shooter is allowed to skate a short distance to the puck in order to gain momentum and then, unlike penalty kicks in soccer and penalty strokes in field hockey, the player is allowed to skate with the puck before shooting.
All players other than the selected shooter and the selected goaltender must move to either side of the ice surface in front of their respective benches.

If a penalty shot is awarded and the penalized team had pulled their goaltender in favour of an extra attacker, the player fouled is automatically awarded a penalty shot goal, regardless of whether the puck went in.

The goaltender must remain in the crease until the attacking player has gained possession of the puck. After this point they may move out of the crease to gain a better defending position. If the goaltender exits the crease prior to the attacker touching the puck, the official allows the play to continue, and any goal scored stands. If the penalty shot is unsuccessful, however, the puck is returned to centre ice and the shot is re-taken, thus penalizing the goaltender by giving another penalty shot.

During the attempt, the puck must move continuously towards the goal once touched. A goal may not be scored from a rebound off of the goaltender, the goal itself or the end boards (however, a goal can be scored from a shot which strikes the goal frame or the goaltender and then goes into the net as a result). Once the puck crosses the end line, the attempt is considered over, regardless of whether a shot was taken.

The goaltender may attempt to stop the shot using any means, except throwing his stick or any other object. Should the goaltender throw any object during the attempt, a goal is automatically awarded.

If the penalty shot is successful, the puck is placed at center ice and play resumes as normal. If the shot is unsuccessful, the puck is placed at either of the faceoff positions in the zone where the play occurred, and play resumes. The time necessary to complete the penalty shot is not taken off of the game clock.

==Strategy==
Strategy is considered to be very important during penalty shots and overtime shootouts for both the shooter and the goaltender. Both shooters and goaltenders commonly consult their teammates and coaches for advice on the opposing player&#x27;s style of play. Shooters often consider the goaltender&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses (such as a fast glove or stick save), preferred goaltending style (such as butterfly or stand-up) and method of challenging the shooter. Goaltenders often consider the shooter&#x27;s shot preference, expected angle of attack, a patented move a shooter commonly uses and even handedness of the shooter.

Most shooters attempt to out-deke the goaltender in order to create a better scoring chance. Minnesota Wild forward Mikko Koivu, Detroit Red Wings forward Pavel Datsyuk, Washington Capitals forward T. J. Oshie and New York Rangers forward Martin St. Louis are examples of players who commonly use this strategy. However, it is not uncommon for a shooter to simply shoot for an opening without deking. This is commonly referred to as sniping. This is most commonly performed when a goaltender challenges a shooter by giving them an open hole (by keeping a glove, pad or stick out of position or being out of sound goaltending position altogether to tempt the shooter to aim for the given opening).

Very rarely a shooter may take a slapshot or wrist shot from the point or top of the slot. This is almost exclusively performed when a shooter either has a high level of confidence in their shot or they attempt to catch the goaltender by surprise. Boston Bruins forward Brian Rolston, Minnesota Wild forward Thomas Vanek and Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Chris Pronger have all used this strategy with success. In fact, Pronger succeeded in using this strategy in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals against Carolina Hurricanes goaltender Cam Ward as a member of the Edmonton Oilers.

Players sometimes use the rarity of point-blank shots as a deking method. Sheldon Souray, owner of one of the hardest slapshots in the NHL, has succeeded by faking a slapshot and simply flipping the puck in. Sometimes a player will even fake a wrist shot by lifting their opposite leg (left leg for a right-handed shooter) or just by flicking their stick directly above the puck. Thomas Vanek also uses this technique.

==History==

The penalty shot was invented in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association in the 1921–22 PCHA season. League president Frank Patrick was fed up with deliberate fouls on players with good scoring opportunities and introduced the free shot. The first shot taken was on December 6, 1921, and the first goal was scored on December 12, 1921 by Tom Dunderdale on Hugh Lehman. The shot was taken from one of three dots painted on the ice from the goal. Players had to skate to the dot and shoot the puck from the dot.

The penalty shot was added to the rule books of the NHL for the 1934–35 season, allowing them to be awarded when a player was fouled while in &quot;a good scoring position.&quot; In the first season, the puck was placed in a circle, from the goalmouth. The player could shoot while stationary within the circle, or could shoot while moving, as long as the shot was taken within the circle. The goaltender had to be stationary until the puck was shot, and no more than in front of the goal mouth.

The first NHL penalty shot was awarded to the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; Armand Mondou on November 10, 1934; he was stopped by the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; George Hainsworth. On November 13, Ralph &quot;Scotty&quot; Bowman of the St. Louis Eagles scored the first penalty shot goal in NHL history. Erik Cole of the Carolina Hurricanes became the first NHL player to attempt two penalty shots in one game playing against the Buffalo Sabres and Martin Biron on November 9, 2005, scoring once. In the Hurricanes&#x27; next game Cole was given another penalty shot but missed the net guarded by the Florida Panthers&#x27; Roberto Luongo. Cole is one of three NHL players, along with Esa Pirnes (October 10 and October 12, 2003) and Andrew Cole (October 16 and October 18 2023), to have taken penalty shots in consecutive games. There have been three occasions when an NHL team successfully converted on two penalty shots in a single game - first on February 11, 1982 when Thomas Gradin and Ivan Hlinka of the Vancouver Canucks scored on shots against Detroit Red Wings goaltender Gilles Gilbert, second on December 30, 2009 when Ryane Clowe and Joe Thornton of the San Jose Sharks converted penalty shots against Washington Capitals goalie Michal Neuvirth, and most recently on March 19, 2017 when Lukáš Sedlák and Brandon Dubinsky of the Columbus Blue Jackets scored on shots against New Jersey Devils goaltender Cory Schneider. On February 6, 2014 Max Pacioretty of the Montreal Canadiens was the first player to be awarded two penalty shots in the same period, against the Vancouver Canucks. He was unsuccessful on both attempts on Roberto Luongo, but still managed to score a hat trick that night.

The occurrence of a penalty shot being called during regular season overtime in the NHL is a comparative rarity since the institution of a limited, five-minute sudden-death overtime for tie-breaking purposes following the 2000-01 NHL season (the overtime concept for regular season games itself being re-instituted for the 1983-84 season onwards), with only three skaters per side in such a period since the 2015-16 NHL season.

Since then, in Stanley Cup play, 46 penalty shots have been called, and only ten in the Final since the first one in NHL play in 1937. The first eight resulted in no score. The first successful penalty shot in NHL Stanley Cup Finals history occurred on June 5, 2006, when Chris Pronger of the Edmonton Oilers beat Cam Ward of the Carolina Hurricanes, following an illegal covering of the puck by Carolina&#x27;s Niclas Wallin. , the most recent failed attempt occurred in the 2007 Final, when Antoine Vermette of the Ottawa Senators had his shot turned aside by Jean-Sébastien Giguère of the Anaheim Ducks.

For possibly the first time in professional hockey, a player was awarded two penalty shots on the same play. This occurred on Friday, November 27, 2009 in a game from the ECHL league between the Utah Grizzlies and the Alaska Aces. Vladimir Nikiforov of the Utah Grizzlies was pulled down from behind on a breakaway and as the play continued the opposing team knocked the net off of its moorings intentionally. Once the referee stopped play he awarded Nikiforov two shots, with the second being negated if a goal was scored on the first, however the goaltender, Scott Reid stopped both shots. A similar sequence happened in the 2019 World Juniors in a game between Switzerland and Russia, where Swiss forward Marco Lehmann was tripped twice on the same breakaway, resulting in two penalty shots for Switzerland, both of which were missed, by Lehmann and Philipp Kurashev.

<text>Johann Jakob Bachofen (22 December 1815 – 25 November 1887) was a Swiss antiquarian, jurist, philologist, anthropologist, and professor of Roman law at the University of Basel from 1841 to 1844.

Bachofen is most often connected with his theories surrounding prehistoric matriarchy, or &quot;Das Mutterrecht&quot;, the title of his seminal 1861 book &quot;Mother Right: an investigation of the religious and juridical character of matriarchy in the Ancient World.&quot; Bachofen assembled documentation demonstrating that motherhood is the source of human society, religion, morality, and decorum. He postulated an archaic &quot;mother-right&quot; within the context of a primeval Matriarchal religion or &quot;Urreligion&quot;.

Bachofen became an important precursor of 20th-century theories of matriarchy, such as the Old European culture postulated by Marija Gimbutas from the 1950s, and the field of feminist theology and &quot;matriarchal studies&quot; in 1970s feminism.

== Biography ==
Born into a wealthy Basel family active in the silk industry and attended the service of the French Reformed Church in Basel. After having attended the Gymnasium, Bachofen studied in Basel and in Berlin under August Boeckh, Karl Ferdinand Ranke and Friedrich Carl von Savigny as well as in Göttingen. After completing his doctorate in Basel, he studied for another two years in Paris, London and Cambridge. He was called to the Basel chair for Roman law in 1841. In 1842 he travelled to Rome accompanied by his father to, according to him, see his spiritual homeland with his own eyes. Having returned to Basel, he was called to the appellate court and his next book on Roman law received the acclaim of the academics. He would also become elected into the Grand Council of Basel. He retired from his professorship in 1844, after in the local press it was suggested the wealth of his family would have helped him assume the job at the university. In 1845 he also quit from the Grand Council. As a judge he would stay for twenty-five years and resign after his marriage to Louise Bachofen-Burckhardt. In 1848 he undertook a second journey to Rome in which he witnessed the Roman revolution, changed his research focus from the classical antiquity but the early antiquity. In 1851–1852 he travelled to Greece, Magna Graecia, and Etruria. He published most of his works as a private scholar.

== Personal life ==

His mother Valeria Merian Bachofen died in 1856 but he kept living in the same house as his father. It was the same house which would become the seat of the Civil Register of Basel between 1962 and 1983 and part of the Antikenmuseum Basel und Sammlung Ludwig in the 1980s. In 1865, he married the at the time twenty five-years old Louise Bachofen-Burckhardt from a noble family of Basel. He would buy a house at the square before the Minster of Basel and a son was born. Louise Bachofen Burckhardt would live in the house at the Minster Square after her husband would die in 1877. Johann Jakob Bachofen is buried at the &quot;Wolfgottesacker&quot; cemetery in Basel. The tomb was sculptured by Richard Kissling.

== &quot;Das Mutterrecht&quot; ==

Bachofen&#x27;s 1861 &quot;Das Mutterrecht&quot; proposed four phases of cultural evolution which absorbed each other:
# Hetaerism: a wild nomadic &#x27;tellurian&#x27; [= chthonic or earth-centered] phase, characterised by him as communistic and polyamorous, whose dominant deity he believed to have been an earthy proto Aphrodite.
# Das Mutterecht: a matriarchal &#x27;lunar&#x27; phase based on agriculture, characterised by him by the emergence of chthonic mystery cults and law. Its dominant deity was an early Demeter.
# The Dionysian: a transitional phase when earlier traditions were masculinised as patriarchy began to emerge. Its dominant deity was the original Dionysos.
# The Apollonian: the patriarchal &#x27;solar&#x27; phase, in which all trace of the Matriarchal and Dionysian past was eradicated and modern civilisation emerged.

=== Reception ===

There was little initial reaction to Bachofen&#x27;s theory of cultural evolution, largely because of his impenetrable literary style, but eventually, along with furious criticism, the book inspired several generations of ethnologists, social philosophers, and even writers: Lewis Henry Morgan; Friedrich Engels, who drew on Bachofen for &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot;; Thomas Mann; Jane Ellen Harrison, who was inspired by Bachofen to devote her career to mythology; Walter Benjamin; Carl Jung; Erich Fromm; Robert Graves; Rainer Maria Rilke; Joseph Campbell; Otto Gross; Erich Neumann and opponents such as Julius Evola. In the 1930s his work was acclaimed by several prominent academics in the German speaking world.

Because of his theoretical commitment to Marxist historiography, Friedrich Engels faulted Bachofen for regarding &quot;religion as the main lever of the world&#x27;s history&quot; and therefore considered it a &quot;troublesome and not always profitable task to work your way through [his] big volume [i.e. &quot;Das Mutterrecht&quot;]&quot;. Nevertheless, he credited Bachofen with inaugurating research into the history of the family. He summarized Bachofen&#x27;s views as follows:
:&quot;(1) That originally man lived in a state of sexual promiscuity, to describe which Bachofen uses the mistaken term &quot;hetaerism&quot;;
:(2) that such promiscuity excludes any certainty of paternity, and that descent could therefore be reckoned only in the female line, according to mother-right, and that this was originally the case amongst all the peoples of antiquity;
:(3) that since women, as mothers, were the only parents of the younger generation that were known with certainty, they held a position of such high respect and honor that it became the foundation, in Bachofen&#x27;s conception, of a regular rule of women (gynaecocracy);
:(4) that the transition to monogamy, where the woman belonged to one man exclusively, involved a violation of a primitive religious law (that is, actually a violation of the traditional right of the other men to this woman), and that in order to expiate this violation or to purchase indulgence for it the woman had to surrender herself for a limited period.&quot; (Friedrich Engels, 1891: see link below)

Emile Durkheim credited Bachofen with upsetting the &quot;old conception&quot; that the father must be &quot;the essential element of the family&quot;. Before Bachofen, Durkheim claims that &quot;no one had dreamed that there could be a family organization of which the paternal authority was not the keystone&quot;.

In contrast to Engels and Durkheim, the American sociologist Carle Zimmerman criticized Bachofen&#x27;s work for initiating a research paradigm in sociology that &quot;completely divorced&quot; the study of the family from history, replacing the &quot;constant struggle between familism and individualism&quot; with &quot;imagination&quot;. He characterized Bachofen and the other members of this research paradigm, such as J.F. McLennan, L.H. Morgan, E.A. Westermark, and others, as &quot;evolutionary cultists&quot; and considered them to have &quot;destroyed history as a fundamental study in social science&quot; during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

As has been noted by Joseph Campbell in &quot;Occidental Mythology&quot; and others, Bachofen&#x27;s theories stand in radical opposition to the Aryan origin theories of religion, culture and society, and both Campbell and writers such as Evola have suggested that Bachofen&#x27;s theories only adequately explain the development of religion among the pre-Aryan cultures of the Mediterranean and the Levant, and possibly Southern Asia, but that a separate, patriarchal development existed among the Aryan tribes which conquered Europe and parts of Asia.

<text>In computing, a memory address is a reference to a specific memory location in memory used by both software and hardware. These addresses are fixed-length sequences of digits, typically displayed and handled as unsigned integers. This numerical representation is based on the features of CPU (such as the instruction pointer and incremental address registers). Programming language constructs often treat the memory like an array.

==Types==
===Physical addresses===
A digital computer&#x27;s main memory consists of many memory locations, each identified by a unique physical address (a specific code). The CPU or other devices can use these codes to access the corresponding memory locations. Generally, only system software (such as the BIOS, operating systems, and specialized utility programs like memory testers) directly addresses physical memory using machine code instructions or processor registers. These instructions tell the CPU to interact with a hardware component called the memory controller. The memory controller manages access to memory using the memory bus or a system bus, or through separate control, address, and data buses, to execute the program&#x27;s commands. The bus managed by the memory controller consists of multiple parallel lines, each representing a binary digit (bit).

===Logical addresses===
A computer program uses memory addresses to execute machine code, and to store and retrieve data. In early computers, logical addresses (used by programs) and physical addresses (actual locations in hardware memory) were the same. However, with the introduction of virtual memory most application programs do not deal directly with physical addresses. Instead, they use logical or virtual addresses, which are translated to physical addresses by the computer&#x27;s memory management unit (MMU) and the operating system&#x27;s memory mapping mechanisms.

==Unit of address resolution==

Most modern computers are &quot;byte-addressable&quot;. Each address identifies a single 8-bit byte (octet) of storage. Data larger than a single byte may be stored in a sequence of consecutive addresses. There exist &quot;word-addressable&quot; computers, where the minimal addressable storage unit is exactly the processor&#x27;s word. For example, the Data General Nova minicomputer, and the Texas Instruments TMS9900 and National Semiconductor IMP-16 microcomputers used 16 bit words, and there are many old mainframe computers that use 36-bit word addressing (e.g., IBM 7090, with 15-bit word addresses, giving an address space of 215 36-bit words, approximately 128 kilobytes of storage, DEC PDP-10, with 18-bit word addresses, giving an address space of 218 36-bit words, approximately 1 megabyte of storage), not byte addressing. The range of addressing of memory depends on the bit size of the bus used for addresses – the more bits used, the more addresses are available to the computer. For example, an 8-bit-byte-addressable machine with a 20-bit address bus (e.g. Intel 8086) can address 220 (1,048,576) memory locations, or one MiB of memory, while a 32-bit bus (e.g. Intel 80386) addresses 232 (4,294,967,296) locations, or a 4 GiB address space. In contrast, a 36-bit word-addressable machine with an 18-bit address bus addresses only 218 (262,144) 36-bit locations (9,437,184 bits), equivalent to 1,179,648 8-bit bytes, or 1152 KiB, or 1.125 MiB — slightly more than the 8086.

Some older computers (decimal computers), are &quot;decimal digit-addressable&quot;. For example, each address in the IBM 1620&#x27;s magnetic-core memory identified a single six bit binary-coded decimal digit, consisting of a parity bit, flag bit and four numerical bits. The 1620 used 5-digit decimal addresses, so in theory the highest possible address was 99,999. In practice, the CPU supported 20,000 memory locations, and up to two optional external memory units could be added, each supporting 20,000 addresses, for a total of 60,000 (00000–59999).

Some older computers are character-addressable, with 6-bit BCD characters containing a 2-bit zone and a 4-bit digit; the characters in an address only have digit values representing 0-9. Typically some of the zone bits are part of the address and some are used for other purposes, e.g., index register, indirect address.

Some older computers are decimal-word addressable, typically with 4-digit addresses. In some machines the address fields also select index registers, restricting the range of possible address.

===Word size versus address size===
Word size is a characteristic of computer architecture denoting the number of bits that a CPU can process at one time. Modern processors, including embedded systems, usually have a word size of 8, 16, 24, 32 or 64 bits; most current general-purpose computers use 32 or 64 bits. Many different sizes have been used historically, including 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 39, 40, 48 and 60 bits.

Very often, when referring to the &quot;word size&quot; of a modern computer, one is also describing the size of address space on that computer. For instance, a computer said to be &quot;32-bit&quot; also usually allows 32-bit memory addresses; a byte-addressable 32-bit computer can address 232 = 4,294,967,296 bytes of memory, or 4 gibibytes (GiB). This allows one memory address to be efficiently stored in one word.

However, this does not always hold true. Computers can have memory addresses larger or smaller than their word size. For instance, many 8-bit processors, such as the MOS Technology 6502, supported 16-bit addresses— if not, they would have been limited to a mere 256 bytes of memory addressing. The 16-bit Intel 8088 and Intel 8086 supported 20-bit addressing via segmentation, allowing them to access 1 MiB rather than 64 KiB of memory. All Intel Pentium processors since the Pentium Pro include Physical Address Extensions (PAE) which support mapping 36-bit physical addresses to 32-bit virtual addresses. Many early LISP implementations on, e.g., 36-bit processors, held 2 addresses per word as the result of a cons. Some early processors held 2 and even 3 addresses per instruction word.

In theory, modern byte-addressable 64-bit computers can address 264 bytes (16 exbibytes), but in practice the amount of memory is limited by the CPU, the memory controller, or the printed circuit board design (e.g., number of physical memory connectors or amount of soldered-on memory).

==Contents of each memory location==

Each memory location in a stored-program computer holds a binary number or decimal number &quot;of some sort&quot;. Its interpretation, as data of some data type or as an instruction, and use are determined by the instructions which retrieve and manipulate it.

Some early programmers combined instructions and data in words as a way to save memory, when it was expensive: The Manchester Mark 1 had space in its 40-bit words to store little bits of data – its processor ignored a small section in the middle of a word – and that was often exploited as extra data storage. Self-replicating programs such as viruses treat themselves sometimes as data and sometimes as instructions. Self-modifying code is generally deprecated nowadays, as it makes testing and maintenance disproportionally difficult to the saving of a few bytes, and can also give incorrect results because of the compiler or processor&#x27;s assumptions about the machine&#x27;s state, but is still sometimes used deliberately, with great care.

===Address space in application programming===
In modern multitasking environment, an application process usually has in its address space (or spaces) chunks of memory of following types:
* Machine code, including:
** program&#x27;s own code (historically known as &quot;code segment&quot; or &quot;text segment&quot;);
** shared libraries.
* Data, including:
** initialized data (data segment);
** uninitialized (but allocated) variables;
** run-time stack;
** heap;
** shared memory and memory mapped files.
Some parts of address space may be not mapped at all.

Some systems have a &quot;split&quot; memory architecture where machine code, constants, and data are in different locations, and may have different address sizes.
For example, PIC18 microcontrollers have a 21-bit program counter to address machine code and constants in Flash memory, and 12-bit address registers to address data in SRAM.

==Addressing schemes==

A computer program can access an address given explicitly – in low-level programming this is usually called an , or sometimes a specific address, and is known as pointer data type in higher-level languages. But a program can also use relative address which specifies a location in relation to somewhere else (the &quot;base address&quot;). There are many more indirect addressing modes.

Mapping logical addresses to physical and virtual memory also adds several levels of indirection; see below.

==Memory models==
Many programmers prefer to address memory such that there is no distinction between code space and data space (see above), as well as from physical and virtual memory (see above) — in other words, numerically identical pointers refer to exactly the same byte of RAM.

However, many early computers did not support such a &quot;flat memory model&quot; — in particular, Harvard architecture machines force program storage to be completely separate from data storage.
Many modern DSPs (such as the Motorola 56000) have three separate storage areas — program storage, coefficient storage, and data storage. Some commonly used instructions fetch from all three areas simultaneously — fewer storage areas (even if there were the same total bytes of storage) would make those instructions run slower.

===Memory models in x86 architecture===

Early x86 processors use the segmented memory model addresses based on a combination of two numbers: a memory segment, and an offset within that segment.

Some segments are implicitly treated as &quot;code segments&quot;, dedicated for instructions, &quot;stack segments&quot;, or normal &quot;data segments&quot;. Although the usages are different, the segments do not have different memory protections reflecting this.
In the flat memory model all segments (segment registers) are generally set to zero, and only offsets are variable.
===Memory models in IBM S/360 and successors multiprocessors===
In the 360/65 and 360/67, IBM introduced a concept known as prefixing. Prefixing is a level of address translation that applies to addresses in real mode and to addresses generated by dynamic address translation, using a unique prefix assigned to each CPU in a multiprocessor system. On the 360/65, 360/67 and every successor prior to z/Architecture, it logically swaps a 4096 byte block of storage with another block assigned to the CPU. On z/Architecture, prefixing operates on 8196-byte blocks. IBM classifies addresses on these systems as:

* Virtual addresses: addresses subject to dynamic address translation
* Real addresses: addresses generated from dynamic address translation, and addresses used by code running in real mode
* Absolute addresses: physical addresses

On the 360/65, on S/370 models without DAT and when running with translation turned off, there are only a flat real address space and a flat absolute address space.

On the 360/67, S/370 and successors through S/390, when running with translation on, addresses contain a segment number, a page number and an offset. Although early models supported both 2 KiB and 4 KiB page sizes, later models only supported 4 KiB. IBM later added instructions to move data between a primary address space and a secondary address space.

S/370-XA added 31-bit addresses, but retained the segment/page/offset hierarchy with 4 KiB pages.

ESA/370 added 16 access registers (ARs) and an AR access control mode, in which a 31-bit address was translated using the address space designated by a selected AR.

z/Architecture supports 64-bit virtual, real and absolute addresses, with multi-level page tables.

<text>Suolahti is a former town and municipality of Finland. It is located next to Lake Keitele in the province of Western Finland and is part of the Central Finland region. Suolahti was merged into Äänekoski together with Sumiainen in 2007.

== History ==

The village was initially known as Paadentaipale; the first mentions of the current name come from are from the 16th century . The opening of the railroad in 1898 industrialized Suolahti and increased the waterborne traffic on Keitele, for which Suolahti provided a railway harbour at its south end. The same year, a steam-mill started operating which was soon followed by other industrial facilities. This sped up population growth and urban development. In the first three decades of the 20th century, the population increased to two thousand. It gained town status in 1977.

===Notable people from Suolahti===
* Jaakko Kolmonen, popular TV chef
* Jack Smack, guitarist and backing vocalist of the Finnish rock band Private Line.
* , inventor and YouTube personality

==Sister cities==

Prior to a 2007 consolidation with Sumiainen to make Äänekoski, Suolahti was twinned with:
* Borovichi, Novgorod Oblast, Russia (status unknown)

<text>Martin Kaplan (born August 21, 1950) is an American professor and former studio executive and writer. He teaches at the USC Annenberg School for Communication &amp; Journalism and is the founding director of the Norman Lear Center for the study of the impact of entertainment on society. His career has also spanned government and politics, the entertainment industry and journalism.

==Early life and education==
Kaplan was born in Newark, New Jersey. The family moved to nearby Union Township, also in New Jersey, at about the time he was to begin his schooling. Kaplan graduated from Union High School, finishing first in his class and was accepted at Harvard where he pursued a double major in both English Literature and Molecular Biology.
Kaplan graduated from Harvard College &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in molecular biology and won the Le Baron Russell Briggs prize for delivering the English Oration at commencement. He was president of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; and of the Signet Society; at both, his tenure included a change in by-laws leading to the first admission of women members after 95 years (the Lampoon) and 100 years (the Signet). Kaplan was also elected to the editorial boards of the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; and the &quot;Harvard Advocate&quot; and was the first Harvard undergraduate to serve on all three of its oldest publications. The recipient of a Marshall Scholarship from the British government, he received a master&#x27;s degree in English with First Class Honours from Cambridge University in England. As a Danforth Foundation Fellow, he received a Ph.D. in Modern Thought and Literature from Stanford University.

==Career==
Kaplan served in the administration of President Jimmy Carter as chief speechwriter to Vice President Walter F. Mondale, and also as executive assistant to the U.S. Commissioner of Education, Ernest L. Boyer. As deputy campaign manager of Mondale&#x27;s presidential campaign, he directed the campaign&#x27;s speechwriting and research operations. He also worked with Boyer on education policy while a program officer at the Aspen Institute, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, and a senior advisor at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

Kaplan worked at the Walt Disney Studios for 12 years, as vice president of production for live-action feature films and as a writer-producer. He has credits on &quot;The Distinguished Gentleman&quot;, starring Eddie Murphy, a political comedy which he wrote and executive produced; &quot;Noises Off&quot;, a farce directed by Peter Bogdanovich, which he adapted for the screen from Michael Frayn&#x27;s play; and the action-adventure &quot;MAX Q&quot;, produced for TV by Jerry Bruckheimer.

Kaplan created and hosted &quot;So What Else Is News?&quot;, the nationally syndicated Air America Radio program examining media politics and pop culture. On public radio, he was a featured commentator on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; (for which he also was the first guest co-host), and on &quot;Marketplace,&quot; where his beat was the business of entertainment. Today he is a Senior Columnist at The Forward. From its inception through 2017 he has been a blogger on the home page of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. For 10 years, he was also a columnist for the &quot;Jewish Journal.&quot; His columns have won six First Place prizes from the Los Angeles Press Club. He was also deputy op-ed editor and a columnist for the &quot;Washington Star&quot; and a commentator on the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;.

Kaplan was associate dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism for 10 years and is the founding director of the School&#x27;s Norman Lear Center, a center of research and innovation whose mission is to study and shape the impact of media and entertainment on society. His Lear Center research includes the political coverage on U.S. local TV news broadcasts, the effects on audiences of public health messages in entertainment storylines; the impact of new technology and intellectual property law on the creative industries, best practices in and barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration, and the depiction of law and justice in popular culture.

==Personal life==

In 1986, Kaplan married Susan Estrich, a lawyer, professor, author, political operative, feminist advocate, and future political commentator for Fox News. They have two children. They subsequently divorced.

<text>Lochwinnoch (; , ) is a village in the council area and historic county of Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. Lying on the banks of Castle Semple Loch and the River Calder, Lochwinnoch is chiefly a residential dormitory village serving nearby urban centres such as Glasgow and Paisley. Its population in 2001 was 2628 and in 2022 was 2769.

The Town also lends its name to a civil parish of some of the surrounding countryside, including the nearby village of Howwood. The parish borders seven others: Beith, Kilbarchan, Kilbirnie, Kilmacolm, Largs, Neilston and Paisley.

==History==

Lochwinnoch is first recorded in the 12th Century as a parish under the higher control of Paisley and Renfrew, but the area has been inhabited since the neolithic period.

The 1729 St John&#x27;s Kirk, also known as &quot;Auld Simon&quot; (Old Simon) (whose front gable still stands at the eastern end of the High Street), was probably built on the site of a pre-Reformation church dating to the Medieval period. It is dedicated to St. John, hence the name of Johnshill, more properly St. John&#x27;s Hill, and St. John&#x27;s well, located in the garden adjacent to the Church Yard.

Janet Pollock and James Tannahill, the parents of Robert Tannahill, were married here on 29 August 1763. Auld Simon&#x27;s early 19th-century replacement, the Church of Scotland-administered Parish Church, complements the formal open space of Harvey Square, on Church Street.

Built not far from the village of Lochwinnoch, Barr Castle is a 15th-century keep which was altered in the 16th century (and probably later, too). The gables of the castle have collapsed, apart from the chimney stack which juts up into the sky. Not much survives of the former courtyard of the castle. The main hall was on the first floor, reached by a turnpike stair, which continued to the rooms on the upper floors. It is clearly visible from the A760 road going south from the village to Kilbirnie. It was built by the Glen family but passed in the late 16th century to the Hamiltons of Ferguslie. A door lintel has a date of 1680 and the initials L.H./I.C. The family abandoned it in the 18th century in favour of a new house.

The family, variously known as Sempill, Sempil, Sempel and Semple, had probably owned estates in the area from as early as the 13th century. Robert Semple, Steward of the barony of Renfrew during the reign of Alexander II, was recorded as living in Elliston Castle, whose ruins lie near Howwood. The Semples of Elliston fought for Robert the Bruce, and steadily grew in power to become the Steward&#x27;s hereditary Baillies of Renfrewshire. They were appointed Hereditary Sheriffs of Renfrewshire and Hereditary Baillies of Paisley. They were later designated as Lords Semple. Their extensive land holdings, Castle Semple, constituted some areas of Lochwinnoch and its hinterland. At some point, probably in the 15th century, the family built a tower keep at the east end of the north shore of the Loch.

In 1504 John, the first Lord Semple, built the Lochwinnoch Collegiate Church, which became one of Scotland&#x27;s finest church schools. Its ruins can be found in Parkhill woods on the edge of the village. John was killed at the Battle of Flodden.

In 1727 the Semples sold the estate to the MacDowalls of Garthland. William MacDowall was one of Glasgow&#x27;s leading West Indies merchants who owned sugar plantations in the Caribbean. In addition to buying the Shawfield Mansion in Glasgow as his town-house he instructed the rebuilding and expansion of Castle Semple in the grand Palladian style in 1735.

The central part of Castle Semple mansion house burned down in 1924. Castle Semple House remains only as ruined buildings, such as the west gate, the garden wall, and a hexagonal building known as The Temple, which was built in 1770 on a hill overlooking the Loch.

In 1795, nine mills were built in Lochwinnoch, for linen cloth, thread, cotton, wool, etc. The ruins of an old corn mill are located in Millbank Glen near the Route 7 cyclepath at Meikle Millbank. The village was developed from 1788 by the Macdowalls mainly to accommodate the work force. As such, notwithstanding the older Johnshill settlement, the village in its modern form was a planned community, rather than one evolving over time. This planned village lies between the original settlement at East End and the River Calder. Three grand vistas along straight streets are closed by two churches and the estate gates.

Furniture manufacturers, originally from Beith, became established in the village in the 19th century. From the 1860s mechanised furniture manufacturing in Scotland was led by factories in the Lochwinnoch and Beith districts, and became dominated by seven major companies, of which Joseph Johnstone &amp; Co Ltd of Lochwinnoch was the largest in Scotland, specialising in dining room furniture of the highest quality. Lochwinnoch-made furniture was to be found on the great Clyde-built liners, including the world&#x27;s largest liners , , and also the ill-fated Belfast-built . The Muirshiel Barytes Mine to the north of the village carried out Baryte from the late 18th century, and by 1918 was known as the Muirshiels Mineral Co. of Lochwinnoch. It closed in 1920, then was reopened in 1942, becoming the Muirshiel Barytes Co. and employing workers from Lochwinnoch and Kilbirnie. Production ended in 1969; the remaining tracks and structures now form a feature near the Muirshiel Visitor Centre in the country park.

Today, Lochwinnoch chiefly serves as a residential village, as well as a satellite to the major city of Glasgow. In 1972, a number of buildings in the village were brought within a newly defined Lochwinnoch Conservation Area as an area of special architectural importance for planning and environment purposes administered by the local authority.
Lochwinnoch Primary School, the only school in the village, celebrated its centenary in 2005. In 2003 it was the centre of a notable alien big cat sighting scare. Children were kept inside during break times, and a police helicopter was brought in to search for the animal.

==History of the lochs==
Lochwinnoch is probably not named after a Loch called &#x27;Loch Winnoch&#x27; (the name almost certainly predates the use of the Scots language in the area, since it is Celtic, as mentioned above) being located next to Castle Semple Loch. There is a long history of drainage schemes and farming operations in the Lochwinnoch area, with co-ordinated attempts dating from about 1691 by Lord Sempill, followed by Colonel McDowal of Castle Sempil in 1774, James Adams of Burnfoot, and by others. Until these drainage works there was one big loch consisting of Castle Semple loch, Barr loch and, in times of flooding, Kilbirnie Loch. Early writers such as Boece, Hollings and Petruccio Ubaldini regarded the three lochs as one, usually applying the name &#x27;Garnoth&#x27; or &#x27;Garnott&#x27;.

Therefore, the two lochs of today, Castle Semple and Barr Lochs, lie in an area covered by one large loch which may have been known as ‘Loch Winnoch’ until the end of the 18th century when silt brought down by the River Calder divided the one loch into two, creating Castle Semple and Barr Loch as separate entities.

==Places of interest==
The loch plays host to a variety of watersports, being part of the Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park and an RSPB bird sanctuary is nearby. There are three public houses in Lochwinnoch; the Corner Bar, the Brown Bull and the Three Churches Inn (previously the Garthland Arms). There is also a cafe, the Junction Bistro located at the cross, and a restaurant at the Golf Course which is open to non-members. Lochwinnoch Golf Club (eighteen holes) is on Burnfoot Rd.

There are three places of worship in the village. Lochwinnoch Parish Church (Church of Scotland) is located on Church Street and meets on Sunday at 11:00, as does the Calder United Free Church, also on Church Street. Lochwinnoch Angels Of Light Spiritualist Church is located in the community park &quot;Annex&quot; on Lochlip Road.

==Notable people==

* Thomas King (1834–1896), botanist

*Dr Hugh Ferguson Watson FRSE (1874–1946) came to notoriety force-feeding suffragettes in 1914
==Transport==

The village is served by Lochwinnoch railway station on the Ayrshire Coast Line. Opened in 1840, it lies to the south west of the village, and is unstaffed.

A second Lochwinnoch railway station was opened in 1905 as part of the Dalry and North Johnstone Line, with the first station being renamed Lochside, until reverting to its original name in the 1990s, the station on the north line closed in 1966. The former railway line serving this second station has been converted into a cycle path and is now part of the National Cycle Network&#x27;s National Cycle Route Number 7, running from Glasgow to Gretna.
There is an hourly bus service to Johnstone throughout the day operated by Shuttle Buses and a service operated by McGill&#x27;s at night and all day on Sundays.
Stagecoach also operate the X36 service which serves Dalry - Glasgow which serves Lochwinnoch linking the village to Glasgow via bus.

==Schools==
Lochwinnoch Primary School, the village&#x27;s only school, is situated on Calder Street. The school was built in 1905 and is a two-story red sandstone building. It celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2005. It has now got an upper and lower school building. The lower building is the original school and the upper school was built to accommodate the nursery which was added to the school.

<doc id="568031" wikidata="Q5634261" url="?curid=568031" title="HMS Scylla (F71)">
<text>HMS &quot;Scylla&quot; (F71) was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was built at Devonport Royal Dockyard, the last RN frigate to be built there as of 2016. &quot;Scylla&quot; was commissioned in 1970, taken out of service in 1993 in accordance with Options for Change, and sunk as an artificial reef in 2004 off Whitsand Bay, Cornwall.

==Construction and career==
In early 1966, the British Admiralty ordered &quot;Scylla&quot;, a &quot;Broad-Beam&quot; &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate, from Devonport Dockyard, at a cost of £6,600,000. &quot;Scylla&quot; was laid down on 17 May 1967, launched on 8 August 1968 and commissioned on 14 February 1970, receiving the pennant number F71.

===1970s===

On 22 January 1973, &quot;Scylla&quot; collided with the Torpoint ferry, one of three separate collisions involving four warships on the same day. &quot;Scylla&quot;″s collision had occurred while on sea trials following a refit. While &quot;Scylla&quot; resumed her journey, the ferry sustained a gash at the bow. A court martial in May reprimanded &quot;Scylla&quot;″s commanding officer, Captain Peter Sutton. In May, &quot;Scylla&quot; was deployed with other frigates to support the Royal Navy&#x27;s operations against Iceland during the Second Cod War. The frigate conducted patrols to counter Icelandic coast guard ships targeting fishing vessels. On 1 June, the Icelandic gunboat &quot;Aegir&quot; collided with &quot;Scylla&quot;, the first such incident to occur during the fishing dispute.

Fishing relations with Iceland deteriorated further in 1975, and the dispute escalated into the Third Cod War. From February 1976, &quot;Scylla&quot; began operating in support of British fishing trawlers. In May, &quot;Scylla&quot; provided the escort to the royal yacht during Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s state visit to Finland. &quot;Scylla&quot; attended the Spithead Fleet Review, held in honour of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. During that review &quot;Scylla&quot; was situated between and sister ship .

===1980s===
In 1980, &quot;Scylla&quot; provided support when Cayman Brac, part of the Cayman Islands, was struck by a powerful hurricane. &quot;Scylla&quot; went into refit in 1980, to provision the frigate with Type 2016 sonar, Exocet and Sea Wolf missile launchers, and a Westland Lynx helicopter. The refit lasted four years, and cost £79,692,000, rendering the frigate unavailable for service in the Falklands. After being recommissioned, &quot;Scylla&quot; acted as guard ship for the West Indies and patrolled the Persian Gulf as part of Armilla Patrol.. In November 1986 at the end of her first Armilla Patrol, she was the escort to &quot;Britannia&quot; during the Prince and Princess of Wales&#x27; visit to the Middle East firing a Royal Salute off Matrah, Oman and also visiting Jiddah. The Princess of Wales flew home from Hurghada and &quot;Syclla&quot; then escorted &quot;Britannia&quot; north through the Suez Canal and on to Akrotiri, Cyprus where Prince Charles disembarked. While on Armilla Patrol in late December 1987, &quot;Scylla&quot; and twice intervened after two ships, the Korean &quot;Hyundai No 7&quot; and British &quot;Eastern Power&quot;, were targeted by Iranian gunships. After the Korean vessel had been attacked south of Abu Musa Island, &quot;Scylla&quot;″s crew launched the frigate&#x27;s Westland Lynx helicopter and evacuated some of the ship&#x27;s crew.

===1990s===
In 1990, &quot;Scylla&quot; underwent a 10-month refit at Rosyth. By 1993, &quot;Scylla&quot; had become the last representative of her class in active service. The frigate&#x27;s last deployment came that year when she deployed to the South Atlantic. By then she was showing her age, and it had become difficult for the ship&#x27;s engineers to maintain. &quot;Scylla&quot; suffered steering problems while on patrol and collided with the accompanying tanker . While &quot;Scylla&quot; suffered only superficial damage, &quot;Gold Rover&quot; had to have repairs for hull damage. &quot;Scylla&quot; was decommissioned in December 1993. In 1992, &quot;Scylla&quot;, with the commanding officer, officers and members of the ship&#x27;s company in attendance, was granted the Freedom of the City of Aberdeen.

==Sinking and use as a dive site==
The ship was bought by the National Marine Aquarium for £200,000 and on 27 March 2004 &quot;Scylla&quot; was sunk off Whitsand Bay, Cornwall, to form the first such artificial reef in Europe. The ship was &#x27;planted&#x27; on a sandy seabed at approximately from the wreck of the Liberty ship , which has been a dive site for many years.

Within three months of sinking the wreck was colonised by sea anemone, mussels and scallops and by six months sea urchin and starfish were found in large numbers. By 2021, 250 species have been recorded.

In 2007 two amateur divers were killed after entering the wreck. Two more experienced divers died inside the engine room on deck three in September 2021. There are fears that the continuing deposition close to the wreck of dredged waste from the Tamar estuary has led to large quantities of silt spreading through the ship and frequently mixing with the moving water reducing visibility, thereby preventing divers from finding their way out before their air supply diminishes. Following a 2014 survey the National Marine Aquarium who manage the site advised divers not to enter the wreck and solely to undertake scenic dives.

<text>Edna Ann Proulx ( ; born August 22, 1935) is an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist. She has written most frequently as Annie Proulx but has also used the names E. Annie Proulx and E.A. Proulx.

She won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for her first novel, &quot;Postcards,&quot; making her the first woman to receive the prize. Her second novel, &quot;The Shipping News&quot; (1993), won both the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction and was adapted as a 2001 film of the same name. Her short story &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; was adapted as an Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe Award-winning motion picture released in 2005.

==Personal life and education==
Proulx was born Edna Ann Proulx in Norwich, Connecticut, to Lois Nellie ( Gill) and Georges-Napoléon Proulx. Her first name honored one of her mother&#x27;s aunts. She is of English and French-Canadian ancestry. Her maternal forebears came to America in 1635, 15 years after the &quot;Mayflower&quot; arrived.

Proulx lived in multiple states along the East Coast during her childhood as her father worked his way up through the textile industry. She wrote her first story at the age of 10, while sick with chicken pox. She graduated from Deering High School in Portland, Maine. She briefly attended Colby College, where she met her first husband, H. Ridgely Bullock, Jr., and dropped out to marry him in 1955. She later returned to college, studying at the University of Vermont from 1966 to 1969, and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in History in 1969. She earned her M.A. in history from Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in Montreal, Quebec in 1973. Proulx pursued a PhD at Concordia and passed her oral examinations in 1975, but abandoned her dissertation before completing the degree. In 1999, Concordia awarded her an honorary doctorate.

Proulx lived for more than 30 years in Vermont, has married and divorced three times, and has three sons and a daughter (Jonathan, Gillis, Morgan, and Sylvia). In 1994, she moved to Bird Cloud, a ranch in Saratoga, Wyoming, spending part of the year in northern Newfoundland on a small cove adjacent to L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows. As of 2019, Proulx lived in Port Townsend, Washington.

==Writing career and recognition==
Starting as a journalist, her first published work of fiction was &quot;The Customs Lounge&quot;, a science fiction story published in the September 1963 issue of &quot;If&quot;, under the byline &quot;E.A. Proulx&quot;.

A year later, her science fiction story &quot;All the Pretty Little Horses&quot; appeared in the teen magazine &quot;Seventeen&quot; in June 1964. She subsequently published stories in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine and &quot;Gray&#x27;s Sporting Journal&quot; in the late 1970s, as well as how-to manuals for cooking and gardening. Proulx published her first short-story collection, &quot;Heart Songs&quot;, in 1988 and her first novel, &quot;Postcards&quot;, in 1992. She was the first woman to receive the PEN/Faulkner Award, which was awarded to &quot;Postcards&quot;. She was awarded a NEA fellowship and a Guggenheim fellowship in 1992. Her 1993 novel The Shipping News was adapted for a 2001 film. Set in Newfoundland yet written by someone &quot;from away&quot; (not from Newfoundland), the novel stresses the vicarious quality of Proulx&#x27; writing.

She had the following comment on her celebrity status: 

In 1997, Proulx was awarded the Dos Passos Prize, a mid-career award for American writers. Proulx has twice won the O. Henry Prize for the year&#x27;s best short story. In 1998, she won for &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, which had appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on October 13, 1997. Proulx won again the following year for &quot;The Mud Below&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; June 22 and 29, 1999. Both appear in her 1999 collection of short stories, &quot;Close Range: Wyoming Stories&quot;. The lead story in this collection, entitled &quot;The Half-Skinned Steer&quot;, was selected by author Garrison Keillor for inclusion in &quot;The Best American Short Stories 1998,&quot; (Proulx herself edited the 1997 edition of this series) and later by novelist John Updike for inclusion in &quot;The Best American Short Stories of the Century&quot; (1999).

In 2007, the composer Charles Wuorinen approached Proulx with the idea of turning her short story &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; into an opera. The opera of the same name with a libretto by Proulx herself premiered January 28, 2014, at the Teatro Real in Madrid. It was praised as an often brilliant adaptation that clearly conveyed the text of the libretto with music that is rich in imagination and variety. Proulx published her first non-fiction book, &quot;Bird Cloud: A Memoir&quot;, largely based on her former Wyoming ranch of the same name. In 2017, she received the Fitzgerald Award for that year for Achievement in American Literature.

<doc id="568034" wikidata="Q473628" url="?curid=568034" title="Free Willy">
<text>Free Willy is a 1993 American adventure drama film, directed by Simon Wincer, produced by Lauren Shuler Donner and Jennie Lew Tugend, written by Keith A. Walker and Corey Blechman from a story by Walker and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures under their Family Entertainment imprint. The film stars Jason James Richter in his film debut, Lori Petty, Jayne Atkinson, August Schellenberg, and Michael Madsen with the eponymous character, Willy, played by Keiko.

The story is about a 12-year-old orphaned boy named Jesse who befriends a captive orca, Willy, at an ailing amusement park. When he discovers that the park owner has been planning to dispose of Willy, he hatches a scheme to break Willy out of captivity.

Released on July 16, 1993, the film received positive attention from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $153.7 million from a $20 million budget. It grew into a small franchise, including an animated television series, two sequels, and a direct-to-video reboot in addition to inspiring the rehabilitation and release of Keiko. The film marked Keith A. Walker&#x27;s only film as screenwriter, and last project before his death in late December 1996.

==Plot==
On the Pacific Northwest coastline, a pod of orcas is tracked down by whalers. An adolescent male orca is captured and separated from his family and sold to the Northwest Adventure Park.

Months later, Jesse, an orphan abandoned by his estranged mother six years ago, fled from Cooperton with his fellow orphans and spends three days roaming Portland, begging for money and stealing food. To evade police in pursuit later that night, he and Perry break into the adventure park&#x27;s observation area unaware that they triggered an alarm. While doing graffiti on the walls and its water tank, Jesse comes face to face with the orca before getting caught by the police. Jesse&#x27;s social worker, Dwight Mercer, informs him that his new foster parents, Glen and Annie Greenwood, would be happy to take him in. Jesse, who hopes to be reunited with his mother, begrudgingly goes to live with them in Astoria.

To avoid being sent to juvenile hall if he flees again, Jesse is allowed to make up for his vandalism by cleaning and repainting the observation area. He forms a bond with the orca, named Willy, when he takes a liking to Jesse&#x27;s harmonica playing. With probation ending, and his job almost up, Jesse sneaks out of the house to visit Willy and falls in the tank. He nearly drowns but Willy saves and brings him to the surface. Randolph Johnson and Rae Lindley, Willy&#x27;s respective Haida caretaker and trainer/veterinarian, notice that Jesse is the only human normally ill-tempered Willy responds to, and eventually, Jesse is offered a summer job. He also starts to warm up to the Greenwoods.

Park owner Dial sees Jesse and Willy&#x27;s talent in hopes of finally making money from the orca, who has thus far been a costly venture for him. On opening day, however, he refuses to perform due to being antagonized. Jesse, unable to get him to do tricks while dealing with pressure from spectators, tearfully storms off and plans to find his mother despite Dwight affirming that she does not want him. Willy cracks the tank with his stress-induced rage, having had enough of the children&#x27;s constant banging. Jesse sneaks out to stop by the tank to say goodbye to Willy. Before leaving, something responds to Willy&#x27;s calling again. Jesse follows the responses and realizes Willy is communicating with his pod. The discovery is interrupted when park manager Wade and some colleagues sneak into the observation area to deliberately damage the spot where Willy smashed the tank so that the water will leak out.

Randolph explains to Jesse that Dial plans to kill Willy and collect the million-dollar insurance. Jesse hatches a plan to return him to the ocean, with Randolph and Rae joining in. They use a forklift to transport Willy from tank to Glen&#x27;s pickup truck Jesse and Randolph stole. Dial launches a search when he is informed by Wade about Willy. When the truck gets stuck in the mud, Jesse uses the truck&#x27;s CB radio to call Glen and Annie for help. Both of them arrive and Glen is reluctant to assist but relents when Jesse pleads with him. After a brief stop at a car wash to wet Willy more, Glen drives the truck to Dawson&#x27;s Marina, where Dial, Wade, and their men have assembled at the gates to halt them. Glen&#x27;s truck smashes through the gate and backs Willy into the water.

After a struggle with Dial&#x27;s men and Wade, Willy manages to swim away, but two of Dial&#x27;s whaling ships seal off the marina. Jesse runs toward the breakwater and encourages Willy to follow him and jump over. On the breakwater, Jesse recites a Haida prayer Randolph had taught him through the story of Natsilane, before giving Willy the signal to jump. Willy makes the jump over and lands in the ocean on the other side, free to return to his pod, while a dismayed Dial and Wade can only watch. Jesse thanks and hugs Glen and Annie as Willy calls out to him in the distance.

Debi Derryberry was a stunt double for Jason James Richter in some scenes including Willy saving Jesse.

== Production ==
=== Writing ===
The project first originated in 1984 when Keith A. Walker conceived of the story while working on &quot;The Goonies&quot; with the film&#x27;s director Richard Donner, who would eventually serve as one of the executive producers for &quot;Free Willy&quot;. In the original script, the character of Jesse was a mute 10-year-old boy living with nuns. Donner and his wife, producer Lauren Schuler Donner, hired screenwriter Corey Blechman to update the script and to make it less sentimental, including making Jesse older and into a street tough-type. Schuler Donner cited the film as part of a broader initiative of making commercial films that while entertaining also convey important messages.

=== Filming ===
Filmmakers searched throughout the U.S., Japan, France, Spain, and Argentina for an orca to portray Willy before settling on Keiko, a twelve-year-old orca that had been residing at Reino Aventura amusement park in Mexico City since 1985. The production team was able to film Keiko in the park while it underwent renovations from May and June 1992. A wooden backdrop was used to make the Reino Aventura aquatic arena appear as if it was located in the Pacific Northwest. Once filming concluded in Mexico City, production moved to Oregon and Washington for location shooting. Oregon locations featured in the film include Ecola State Park, Oregon Convention Center, Pioneer Courthouse Square, Morrison Bridge, 14th Street Pier, Tom McCall Waterfront Park, Burnside Skatepark and Oaks Amusement Park. The climactic jump scene takes place at the Hammond Marina in Warrenton where a rocket launcher was used to shoot the Willy animatronic out of the shoot. The final scene along with the opening and end credits orca wildlife montages were shot by Bob Talbot.

Most close-up shots involving limited movement by Willy, such as when he is in the trailer and the sequences involving him swimming in the open water, make use of an animatronic stand-in. Walt Conti, who supervised the effects for the orcas, estimated that half of the shots of the orca used animatronic stand-ins. Conti stated that the smaller movements of a real orca actually made things difficult in some ways for him and his crew; they had to concentrate on smaller nuances in order to make the character seem alive. The most extensive use of CGI in the film is the climax where Willy jumps over Jesse and into the wild. All stunts with Keiko were performed by the young orca trainer Justin Sherbert (known additionally by his stage name, Justin Sherman).

Principal photography took place from May 18 to August 17, 1992.

== Release ==
=== Box office performance ===
The film was released alongside &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; and &quot;Benefit of the Doubt&quot; on July 16, 1993, and grossed $7,868,829 domestically in its opening weekend. It went on to make $76 million in its foreign release and $11,181 from the 2021 re-release in some domestic markets, bringing the film&#x27;s gross to $153,709,806. Upon its initial release, &quot;Free Willy&quot; ranked number 5 behind &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; plus holdovers from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; and &quot;The Firm&quot; at the box office before moving to number 4 by the following weekend and it stayed there for two more weeks. Afterward, its rank in the box office began to gradually decline, with the exception of a three-day weekend (September 3 to 6), in which gross revenue increased by 33.6%.

=== Critical response ===
The film has received positive reviews from critics. The Rotten Tomatoes website reported that 71% of critics have given the film a fresh rating based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Free Willy&quot; tugs at the heartstrings skillfully enough to leap above the rising tide of sentimentality that threatens to drown its formulaic family-friendly story&quot;. The film on Metacritic has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; from 14 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale. The film received a negative review from Gene Siskel, who said he had &quot;a problem with the whale as a creature to be loved&quot; since &quot;[its] eyes are so set far apart you can&#x27;t even see them&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
===Home media===
&quot;Free Willy&quot; sold almost 9 million units on videocassette following its release on December 11, 1993. The original VHS, 10th Anniversary DVD, and Blu-ray releases also had a music video of the Michael Jackson song, &quot;Will You Be There&quot;.

== Soundtrack ==
The &quot;Free Willy&quot; film soundtrack was released on July 13, 1993, on CD and audio cassette by MJJ Music and LaFace Records in association with the Epic Records sub-label Epic Soundtrax. It contained all the songs that were featured in the film. Michael Jackson wrote, produced and performed &quot;Will You Be There&quot;, taken from his 1991 album &quot;Dangerous&quot;, which can be heard during the end credits (without the orchestral prelude and interlude). The single version, under the title &quot;Will You Be There (Reprise)&quot;, is also included. The song went on to become a top 10 hit in the Billboard Hot 100 charts and was certified platinum as well as winning the 1994 MTV Movie Award for Best Song from a Movie. A remix of SWV&#x27;s 1992 song &quot;Right Here&quot;, which contained a sample of Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Human Nature&quot;, became the group&#x27;s highest charted single to date and the second biggest hit off the soundtrack when it also landed in the Hot 100 chart at No. 2. New Kids on the Block recorded their first song since they briefly changed their name to NKOTB.

=== Track listing ===
== Keiko ==

The aquatic star of the film was an orca named Keiko. The huge national and international success of this film inspired a letter writing campaign to get Keiko released from his captivity as an attraction in the amusement park Reino Aventura in Mexico City; this movement was called &quot;Free Keiko&quot;. Warner Bros. was so grateful for the whale, and so moved by the fans&#x27; ambition, they contributed to rehabilitate and (if possible) free Keiko. He was moved to The Oregon Coast Aquarium in Oregon by flying in a UPS C-130 cargo plane. In Oregon, he was returned to health with the hopes of being able to return to the wild. In 1998, Keiko was moved to Iceland via a US Air Force C-17 to learn to live in the wild. After working with handlers, he was released from a sea pen in the summer of 2002 and swam to Norway following a pod of wild orcas.

His subsequent return to humans for food and for company, and his inability to integrate with a pod of orcas confirms that the project had failed according to a scientific study published in the journal &quot;Marine Mammal Science&quot; (July 2009). Keiko eventually died of pneumonia exacerbated by a deformed fin in a Norwegian bay on December 12, 2003.

A decade later in 2013, a &quot;New York Times&quot; video reviewed Keiko&#x27;s release into the wild. Reasons cited for Keiko&#x27;s failure to adapt include his early age at capture, the long history of captivity, prolonged lack of contact with other orcas, and strong bonds with humans.

<text>Ralston (&quot;Baile Raghnaill&quot; in Scottish Gaelic) is a small, middle-class, suburban settlement in Renfrewshire, Scotland, being part of the greater town of Paisley. The district straddles the A761 (formerly the A737), the main dual-carriageway between Renfrewshire and the City of Glasgow.

==History==

===Estates of Ralston===
The modern settlement of Ralston takes its name from the ancient feudal estates of &quot;Ralphistoun&quot; (Ralph&#x27;s town), named after the younger son of the Earl of Fife, to whom the lands were given in the early 12th century. The feudal estates included the lands of Auldtoun (now Oldhall), Hullhead, Barshaw, Whitehaugh, Byres, Honeybog, Pennilee, Maylee and Ralstonwood.

When the use of surnames was adopted in the Scottish Lowlands, the descendants of the Earl&#x27;s younger son named themselves &#x27;Ralston&#x27; after the estates. The lands remained in the Ralston family until 1704 when they were sold by Gavin Ralston to John, Earl of Dundonald, who conferred them on his daughter, Lady Anne Cochrane, when she married James Hamilton, 5th Duke of Hamilton. Their son sold Ralston in 1755 to William MacDowal of Castle Semple, an eminent Glasgow merchant and one of the founders of the Ship Bank there. His son, William of Garthland and Castle Semple, sold Ralston in 1800 to William Orr, son of a Paisley manufacturer who, with his brother, had made his fortune in the manufacture of linens in Ireland. Three years earlier, he had acquired from the Earl of Glasgow, part of the lands of Ingliston, on which he built an elegant manor house. Upon purchase of the estates, he merged all of them into one, which he called Ralston, and his manor house became the Mansion of Ralston. In 1840, James Richardson, a Glasgow merchant, secured the lands. His son, Thomas Richardson, enlarged the mansion and increased the size of the estate.

The Ralston estates were eventually carved up and sold as farmland in the late 19th century. The ruins of Ralston Mansion were demolished in the 1930s, however part of the original stonework forms an annex to the club house at Ralston Golf Club. The East and West Lodges on the Glasgow Road were the original gate houses to the estates.

===Planned village===
In the early 19th century, the development of the textile industry in Renfrewshire resulted in the increase in road traffic across the county. The main road running through the Ralston estates was nothing more than a narrow dirt track. The original road ran from Paisley, through the then-village of Williamsburgh and across the tops of the Byres, Barshaw and Honeybog hills. When a programme of long distance road construction was introduced, a new road was built, snaking through the low-lying ground at the foot of the hills. The original track later fell into disuse and the new route became what is now the Glasgow Road.

Villas began to appear along Glasgow Road in the late 19th century, mostly in what is now the Oldhall district near Barshaw Park. A village-proper was established in the valley between the hills of Bathgo and Honeybog in the early 1930s as post-war residential development increased. Developers planned Ralston as a leafy haven for wealthy Paisley textile merchants, wishing to raise their families in a more rural setting beyond the burgh&#x27;s boundaries.

Most of the area&#x27;s original farmhouses were demolished to make way for the fledgling village. These included:

* Oldhall (at the far end Oldhall Road, which was actually originally the path leading up to the farmhouse)
* Rylees (which sat at the bend of Atholl Crescent - its path coincides roughly with School Road, leading down to Penilee Road, which like Glasgow Road, was a well-established track)
* South Hillington (the most recent victim of Ralston&#x27;s expansion, which lay in ruin until 1973 when it was finally consigned to the history books to make way for Ossian Avenue)
* South Ingliston (which lay in what is now Ralston Golf Course, just beyond the bend of Bathgo Avenue)
* The Furnace (originally number 18 Penilee Road)

==Geography==

Ralston is situated primarily on a series of south-facing hillsides, overlooking the Gleniffer Braes and the Bullwood plantation. The district merges congruously with the sandstone villas of Paisley to its west. Here, Barshaw Park provides a convenient boundary between the district and its larger neighbour. To the east, Ralston&#x27;s painted stone cottages and their proudly-maintained front gardens define the Glasgow Road all the way to the Renfrewshire border and beyond, merging unobtrusively with the cottages of neighbouring Crookston. Ralston&#x27;s northern edge is defined by South Arkleston farm at the foot of Penilee Bridge; its southern extent is limited by Ralston Golf Course and the leeward side of Bathgo Hill.

To the north, the district&#x27;s official (ward) boundary extends beyond Penilee Bridge, to the main Paisley - Glasgow railway (Inverclyde Line), which forms the boundary between North and South Arkleston farms. To the south, Ralston&#x27;s &#x27;jurisdiction&#x27; takes in the whole of Ralston Golf Course and extends beyond the Paisley Canal railway line to the White Cart Water at Ross Hall Mains farm.

Ralston&#x27;s northern boundary falls close to the out-of-town retail development at Braehead on the River Clyde near Renfrew. To the west, Ralston&#x27;s boundary with Paisley is less well-defined. Despite Paisley&#x27;s pre-1974 burgh boundary intersecting the Glasgow Road at the corner of Oldhall Road, today, the district is considered by many, including the local community council, to include the part of Paisley between Hawkhead Road and the historic Paisley-Ralston boundary. This is primarily attributable to the fact that, in spite of the formal administrative boundaries, both current and traditional, children living east of Hawkhead Road have always fallen within the catchment area of Ralston Primary School.

==Administration==
Despite its close proximity to Paisley, Ralston has always remained independent of its larger neighbour, and until 1974, formed the most part of &quot;Hurlet and Oldhall&quot; in the 2nd Landward District of the County of Renfrew.

In a local referendum, held in 1995 ahead of the planned abolition of the Strathclyde Region and the partition of Renfrewshire into three separate local government areas, the residents of Ralston voted overwhelmingly against leaving the new Paisley-based (and Labour-dominated) Renfrewshire authority to become an annex of the newly partitioned (and Conservative-run) East Renfrewshire. Despite East Renfrewshire&#x27;s assurance that a local government office would be set up within Ralston, locals were concerned that the district would be no more than a remote outpost, linked to the rest of the authority by a narrow strip of countryside with no direct road or public transport links connecting the two. By far the most persuasive reason against annexation, however, was that Ralston School was (and is) one of the five feeder primaries, serving Paisley&#x27;s Grammar School. Parents were concerned that if the district were to leave the jurisdiction of Renfrewshire&#x27;s education authority, local children would be prevented from attending Ralston&#x27;s closest secondary school.

Ralston is now administered as a local government ward of the Renfrewshire authority (named Paisley Northeast and Ralston). In terms of local democracy, the district is represented by the Ralston Community Council, which lobbies the Renfrewshire authority on matters of local significance. Nationally, the area falls within the Paisley constituency of the Scottish Parliament and is represented in the UK Parliament as part of Paisley and Renfrewshire North.

Today, mainly as a result of postal addressing and local government reorganisation, many newcomers to Ralston are unaware that they do not technically live in Paisley. Nowadays, the only obvious, albeit subtle, reminder of Ralston&#x27;s separate identity is the fact that on crossing into Renfrewshire on the A761 Glasgow Road, drivers pass a &quot;Welcome to Renfrewshire&quot; sign a whole kilometre before they pass a sign welcoming them to Paisley.

Ralston&#x27;s current status, however, is that of a middle-class Paisley suburb.

==Transport==
The main road through Ralston is the A761, which begins in Port Glasgow at the junction with the A8, and runs through Linwood and Paisley before reaching Ralston. It then continues across the Renfrewshire-Glasgow border through Crookston, Cardonald and Ibrox to Paisley Road Toll, where it meets the A8 once again. The road is regularly subject to police speed checks, due to the problem of drivers speeding through Ralston&#x27;s 30 mph limit. Typically around 1,400 vehicles travel in both directions through the area per hour.

As a middle-class suburb, car ownership is among the highest in Renfrewshire, with many 2-car households. Ralston is also above the Strathclyde regional average in car ownership, which is the lowest in Scotland.

Ralston is bounded by both the Paisley Canal and Ayrshire &amp; Inverclyde railway lines on its southern and northern sides, respectively. Whilst Hillington, Crookston and Hawkhead stations are close for some residents, the majority of the district&#x27;s population live too far away to receive a convenient train service. The Paisley Canal line partially re-opened in 1990, following its closure in 1983, one of the last railway lines to ever fall victim of the Beeching cuts. Hawkhead station opened later than the rest of the line in 1991.

Primarily on account of its location on the main route between Paisley and Glasgow, Ralston is well-served by local bus services, with some services running 24 hours a day at weekends. It is estimated that the frequency of buses on the main A761 road is every 2–3 minutes during the day, which makes traffic through Ralston very busy indeed. First Glasgow, First Stop Travel and McGill&#x27;s Bus Services operate bus routes through the area, connecting Ralston with neighbouring towns and facilities, including Paisley, Johnstone, Glasgow Airport and Glasgow.

==Trivia==
* Scottish middle class actors David Tennant, Tom Conti and Gerard Butler hail from Ralston, as does interior designer John Amabile, poet Graham Fulton,Comedian Richie McMahon and New York City private arts club owner, Alan Linn.
* Today, Penilee Road runs northward past the Arkleston farms and turns sharply to the right to avoid the M8 motorway as it enters Hillington Estate. At this bend, the road used to veer slightly to the left and continued through to Renfrew, where it became what is now Newmains Road.
* Historically, Ralston&#x27;s boundaries were defined by the East and West Gates, the former entrances to what was the Ralston Estate, which still contains period houses at these locations. Bus fares, however, have remained true to history and buses only enter the Ralston &#x27;fare stage&#x27; at Bathgo Avenue - at the site of the period house at Ralston East Gate. The Ralston stage runs from here to the corresponding West Gate at Strathmore Avenue. This leaves the section from the Renfrewshire boundary at Killearn Drive to Bathgo Avenue erroneously in the Crookston stage. Similarly, a mismatch between the Strathclyde ZoneCard and local authority boundaries has resulted in the portion of Ralston east of Penilee Road in the Greater Glasgow &#x27;G3&#x27; zone, with the rest of the district in the more appropriate Renfrewshire &#x27;R1&#x27; zone. This anomaly does, however, result in residents in eastern Ralston, who commute to Glasgow for work, enjoying cheaper public transport costs, as they require one less zone than the rest of eastern Renfrewshire.
* Until the 1950s, Buchlyvie Road only existed on the Auchmannoch side of the Southwold hill crest, turning sharply right into Southwold Road rather than continuing down-hill toward Ralston School. Similarly, Auchmannoch Avenue ran from its cul-de-sac near Dalfoil Court to Buchlyvie Road where it formed a T-junction - the stretch between Buchlyvie Road and Penilee Road was a later addition, as characterised by the modern brick construction of the houses in contrast to the traditional sandstone that is common in Ralston.
* Up until 1966, what is now the M8 motorway between Hillington and Arkleston was built adjacent to the runway of Renfrew International Airport, which closed in that year, following the opening of the new Glasgow (Abbotsinch) Airport slightly further west. Hillington Estate was actually the airport engineering works, hence it being (until recently) the location of the Rolls-Royce Plc aero engine plant.
*St Mirren F.C. along with Renfrewshire Council turned the Ralston Community Centre fields into a football training facility and academy.

<doc id="568042" wikidata="Q152339" url="?curid=568042" title="Porta Nigra">
<text>The Porta Nigra (Latin for &quot;black gate&quot;), referred to by locals as Porta, is a large Roman city gate in Trier, Germany. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The name &quot;Porta Nigra&quot; originated in the Middle Ages due to the darkened colour of its stone; the original Roman name has not been preserved.

==History==
===Roman===
The Porta Nigra was built in grey sandstone after 170 AD. The original gate consisted of two four-storeyed towers, projecting as near semicircles on the outer side. A narrow courtyard separated the two gate openings on either side. For unknown reasons, however, the construction of the gate remained unfinished. For example, the stones at the northern (outer) side of the gate were never abraded, and the protruding stones would have made it impossible to install movable gates. Nonetheless, the gate was used as a town entrance for centuries until the end of the Roman era in Trier.

In Roman times, the Porta Nigra was part of a system of four city gates, one of which stood at each side of the roughly rectangular Roman city. It guarded the northern entry to the Roman city, while the &quot;Porta Alba&quot; (White Gate) was built in the east, the &quot;Porta Media&quot; (Middle Gate) in the south, and the &quot;Porta Inclyta&quot; (Famous Gate) in the west, next to the Roman bridge across the Moselle. The gates stood at the ends of the two main streets of the Roman Trier, one of which led north-south and the other east-west. Of these gates, only the Porta Nigra still exists.

===Middle Ages===
In the early Middle Ages the Roman city gates were no longer used for their original function and their stones were taken and reused for other buildings. Moreover, iron and lead braces were broken out of the walls of the Porta Nigra for reuse. Traces of this destruction are still clearly visible on the north side of the gate.

After 1028, the Greek monk Simeon lived as a hermit in the ruins of the Porta Nigra. After his death (1035) and sanctification, the &quot;Simeonstift&quot; monastery was built next to the Porta Nigra to honor him.

To save it from further destruction, the Porta Nigra was transformed into two superimposed churches with identical floor plans. The upper church was accessible to the monks and the lower church was open to the general public.

The church naves were created by extending the first and second floors over the inner courtyard. An apse was constructed onto the east tower. Additional levels and a spire were added to the western tower. The top floor of the eastern tower was removed, and a new clerestory level was built over the nave, east tower and apse. Windows of the western tower were enlarged to become entrance doors (still visible).

The ground floor with the large gates was buried inside a terrace, and a large staircase was constructed alongside the south side (the town side) up to the lower church. A small staircase led further up to the upper church.

An additional gate (the much smaller Simeon Gate) was built adjacent to the East side of the Porta Nigra and served as a city gate in medieval times.

===Modern===
In 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the church in the Porta Nigra and the monastery beside it, along with the vast majority of Trier&#x27;s numerous churches and monasteries. On his visit to Trier in 1804, Napoleon ordered that the Porta Nigra be converted back to its Roman form. The clerestory level and church tower were deconstructed, and the inner courtyard was reinstated. However, the apse was preserved in a truncated form, and the eastern tower was not rebuilt to its original height. The terrace surrounding the ground floor level was removed.

Local legend has it that Napoleon originally wanted to completely tear down the church, but locals convinced him that the church had actually been a Gaulish festival hall before being turned into a church. Another version of the story is that they told him about its Roman origins, persuading him to convert the gate back to its original form.

It was designated as part of the Roman Monuments, Cathedral of St Peter and Church of Our Lady in Trier UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986 because of its testimony to the influence of Trier in the Roman Empire and its unique architecture as both a city gate and a double church.

==Today==
Generally the Porta Nigra is still in remarkable condition. Its modern appearance goes back almost unchanged to the reconstruction ordered by Napoleon, with a crowning cornice and parapet on its top. Roman columns line the last 100 m of the street leading to the gate from the south, positioned as they had been in Roman times to give the impression of the colonnade that once lined its route into the city.

The gate is closed to cars today, but stands right next to one of the main streets of Trier. Air pollution, particularly the exhaust fumes of passing cars, continues to darken and damage its stones. 

The gate, including the upper floors, is open to visitors. In summer, tours are offered by a guide costumed as a centurion (a Roman army officer) in full armor.

New Trier Township in Cook County, Illinois, USA, is named after Trier, and New Trier Township High School&#x27;s seal depicts the Porta Nigra.
