<text>Carlo Alberto Biggini (December 9, 1902 – November 19, 1945) was an Italian fascist politician who served as minister of education before and after proclamation of the Italian Social Republic under Benito Mussolini.

==Biography==
Born in Sarzana, Province of La Spezia, he joined the Blackshirts in 1920, and co-signed the &quot;Fascist Intellectuals&#x27; Manifesto&quot; in 1925. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law and political science in 1928, and subsequently taught law at the University of Sassari, and then at the University of Pisa (where he became the rector in 1941). Biggini asserted himself through his strong belief in corporatism.

Despite a brief collaboration with Anti-fascists, he joined the National Fascist Party (PNF) in 1928, and became party secretary for the Fascio in La Spezia, being elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1934. He fought in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (as a lieutenant in the 84th Fanteria of the Division &quot;Gavinana&quot; in Italian East Africa), and rose to become inspector for the PNF, then (February 5, 1943) Minister of National Education and a Grand Council of Fascism member.

On July 25, Biggini voted against Dino Grandi&#x27;s proposal for the removal of Mussolini, and stood by the Duce as the Social Republic was created with help from Nazi Germany. The Germans were also instrumental in pressuring him to accept the Ministry again. Placing his seat in Padova, Biggini managed to avoid capture by the partisans in Dongo.

Protected by many fascists, he managed to avoid arrest, but fell ill and died under an assumed name in a Milan clinic.

<text>The George Price Highway is one of four main highways in Belize. It originates in Belize City, runs west through Hattieville, the Belize Zoo, the capital city of Belmopan (northern outskirts), San Ignacio, San José Succotz (across the river from Xunantunich archaeological site) and terminates at the Guatemalan border at Benque Viejo. The highway bisects the country and ties the eastern and western parts of Belize together. A new steel bridge over Beaver Dam Creek was constructed to replace the broken concrete one.

The highway was built in the 1930s and was originally known as the Western Highway. It was renamed the George Price Highway in 2012, after the late former prime minister who led the country to independence in 1981.

== History ==
2003, September 20. The Beaver Dam Creek Bridge was reconstructed as a new steel bridge to replace the old broken concrete bridge.

2012, September 20. The Western Highway was renamed the George Price Highway in honour of George Price.

2016, July. A new roundabout was constructed at the junction of the George Price Highway and the Hummingbird Highway.

2020, March 20. The Roaring Creek Bridge was reconstructed due to the old bridge being too narrow and getting congested.

<doc id="574944" wikidata="Q58822" url="?curid=574944" title="Max Schreck">
<text>Friedrich Gustav Maximilian Schreck (6 September 1879 – 20 February 1936), known professionally as Max Schreck, was a German actor, best known for his lead role as the vampire Count Orlok in the film &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922).

==Early life==
Max Schreck was born in Berlin-Friedenau, on 6 September 1879. Six years later, his father bought a house in the independent rural community of Friedenau, then part of the district of Teltow.

Schreck&#x27;s father did not approve of his son&#x27;s ever-growing enthusiasm for theatre. His mother provided the boy with money, which he secretly used for acting lessons, although only after the death of his father did he attend drama school. After graduating, he travelled briefly across the country with poet and dramatist Demetrius Schrutz.

Schreck had engagements in Mulhouse, Meseritz, Speyer, Rudolstadt, Erfurt and Weissenfels, and his first extended stay at The Gera Theatre. Greater engagements followed, especially in Frankfurt am Main. From there, he went to Berlin for Max Reinhardt and the Munich Kammerspiele for Otto Falckenberg.

Schreck received his training at the Berliner Staatstheater (State Theatre of Berlin), completing it in 1902. He made his stage début in Meseritz and Speyer, and then toured Germany for two years, appearing at theatres in Zittau, Erfurt, Bremen, Lucerne, Gera, and Frankfurt am Main. Schreck then joined Max Reinhardt&#x27;s company of performers in Berlin. Many members of Reinhardt&#x27;s troupe went on to make significant contributions to the German film industry.

==Career==

For three years between 1919 and 1922, Schreck appeared at the Munich Kammerspiele, including a role in the expressionist production of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s début, (&quot;Drums in the Night&quot;) in which he played the &quot;freakshow landlord&quot; Glubb. During this time, he also worked on his first film &quot;The Mayor of Zalamea&quot;, adapted from a six-act play, for Decla Bioscop. 

In 1921, he was hired by Prana Film for its first and only production, &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922), an unlicenced adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. The company declared itself bankrupt after the film was released to avoid paying copyright infringement costs to the author&#x27;s widow, Florence Stoker. Schreck portrayed Count Orlok, a character analogous to Count Dracula.

While still in Munich, Schreck appeared in a 16-minute (one-reeler) slapstick, &quot;surreal comedy&quot; written by Bertolt Brecht with cabaret and stage actors Karl Valentin, Liesl Karlstadt, Erwin Faber, and Blandine Ebinger, entitled (&quot;Mysteries of a Barbershop&quot;, 1923), directed by Erich Engel. Schreck appeared as a blind man in the film &quot;The Street&quot; (also 1923).

Schreck&#x27;s second collaboration with &quot;Nosferatu&quot; director F. W. Murnau was the comedy (&quot;The Grand Duke&#x27;s Finances&quot;, 1924). Even Murnau did not hesitate to declare his contempt for the picture. In 1926, Schreck returned to the Kammerspiele in Munich and continued to act in films, his career surviving the advent of sound until 1936, when he died from heart failure.

==Personal life==

Schreck was married to actress Fanny Normann, who appeared in a few films, often credited as Fanny Schreck.

One of Schreck&#x27;s contemporaries recalled that he was a loner with an unusual sense of humour and skill in playing grotesque characters. He also reported that he lived in &quot;a remote and incorporeal world&quot; and that he often spent time walking through forests.

There were rumours at the time of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; and for many years afterwards that Schreck did not actually exist and was a pseudonym for the well-known actor Alfred Abel.

==Death==
On 19 February 1936, Schreck had just played The Grand Inquisitor in the play , standing in for Will Dohm. That evening, he felt unwell, and the doctor sent him to the hospital where he died early the next morning of a heart attack. His obituary especially praised his lead role performance in Molière&#x27;s play &quot;The Miser&quot;. He was buried on 14 March 1936 at Wilmersdorfer Waldfriedhof Stahnsdorf in Brandenburg.

==Cultural references==

The person and performance of Max Schreck in &quot;Nosferatu&quot; was fictionalised by actor Willem Dafoe in E. Elias Merhige&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot;. In a secret history, &quot;Shadow&quot; posits that Schreck was a real vampire. Dafoe was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Schreck.

Scriptwriter Daniel Waters created the character Max Shreck (portrayed by Christopher Walken) for the Tim Burton film &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and compared him to the character Max Schreck played in &quot;Nosferatu&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; claimed the name was an in-joke.

Schreck&#x27;s portrayal of the Orlok character later became a recurring character in the &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; universe as the night shift manager for the Krusty Krab; this was initially portrayed using archive stills of Schreck before the role was cast with actors Alexander Ward and Dee Bradley Baker.

Schreck&#x27;s Count Orlok was used as stock video in the music video of the Queen and David Bowie song &quot;Under Pressure&quot;.

A reenactment at Max Schreck&#x27;s grave in Stahnsdorf near Berlin is depicted in the 2022 silent film &quot;F.W.M. Symphony&quot; by visual artist Thomas Hörl.

In the tabletop role-playing game &quot;&quot;, members of the clan Nosferatu operate a secret computer network known as SchreckNET, named after Max Schreck.

<text>As a subfield of public economics, fiscal federalism is concerned with &quot;understanding which functions and instruments are best centralized and which are best placed in the sphere of decentralized levels of government&quot; (Oates, 1999). In other words, it is the study of how competencies (expenditure side) and fiscal instruments (revenue side) are allocated across different (vertical) layers of the administration. An important part of its subject matter is the system of transfer payments or grants by which a central government shares its revenues with lower levels of government.

Federal governments use this power to enforce national rules and standards. There are two primary types of transfers, conditional and unconditional. A conditional transfer from a federal body to a province, or other territory, involves a certain set of conditions. If the lower level of government is to receive this type of transfer, it must agree to the spending instructions of the federal government. An example of this would be the Canada Health Transfer. An unconditional grant is usually a cash or tax point transfer, with no spending instructions. An example of this would be a federal equalization transfer.

In 2017, Governor of Rivers State of Nigeria, Ezenwo Nyesom Wike said that he believes true fiscal federalism will &quot;strengthen the economy of his country as all sections will develop based on their comparative advantages&quot;. These questions arise: (a) how are federal and non-federal countries different with respect to &#x27;fiscal federalism&#x27; or &#x27;fiscal decentralization&#x27;, and (b) how are fiscal federalism and fiscal decentralization related (similar or different)?

== Main concepts ==

The concepts of fiscal federalism are related to vertical and horizontal fiscal relations. The notions related to horizontal fiscal relations are related to regional imbalances and horizontal competition. Similarly the notions related to fiscal relations are related to vertical fiscal asymmetry (VFA) between the two senior levels of government, that is ,the centre and the states/provinces. While the concept of horizontal fiscal imbalance is relatively non controversial (as explained above), there is a lively debate around the concepts of vertical fiscal imbalance and vertical fiscal gap (see Boadway 2002 Bird 2003).

Many public policy experts prefer the notion of &quot;vertical fiscal asymmetry&quot; —coined and conceptualised by Sharma (2011)—over its alternative &quot;vertical fiscal imbalance&quot; because the former is relatively neutral and highlights the unfeasibility of a balance or symmetry purporting to eliminate any kind of vertical fiscal asymmetry. VFA acknowledges the inherent challenges in achieving a perfect balance or symmetry in fiscal relations between different levels of government. This concept recognizes that a certain degree of asymmetry is an unavoidable and realistic aspect of fiscal federalism.

The term VFI often carries a negative connotation. It suggests a deviation from an ideal state of fiscal balance, which might not be practically achievable or even desirable in a federal system. The use of VFA, therefore, avoids these implications and focuses more on the pragmatic aspects of fiscal federalism. Moreover, the terminology of VFA is thought to implicitly support the devolution of funds to subnational governments. On the other hand, the term VFI is sometimes interpreted as opposing intergovernmental transfers. Therefore, the concept of VFA offers a more nuanced framework for understanding the dynamics of fiscal federalism.

== Local, national and international public goods ==
Various activities of the government are undertaken at different levels. To understand the assignment of responsibilities to the different levels of state, it can be beneficial to define, whether it is more useful to deal with problems at the local or the federal level. Public goods in general are goods that are neither excludable nor rival. For that reason, they are usually provided by the government. For some kind of goods, the benefits accrue to residents of a particular area or community. These are called local public goods. Examples of them are traffic lights or fire protection. In contrast, for national public goods, there is a presumption for federal provision, because their benefits accrue to everyone in the nation. An example is national defense. There are also some public goods, from which benefit people living all over the world. These are called international public goods, e.g. global environment.

To be the supply of public goods efficient, national public goods must be supplied at national level, local public goods at local level, etc. If the provision of national public goods is left to local communities, there would be a freerider problem and there can occur an undersupply of those goods. Similarly, there is likely to be an undersupply of international public goods, if they are provided by the national governments. However, it does not exist any highest level of the government, which stands above national governments, which would be given responsibility for resolving global externality problems. The closest approximation to a global government is probably the United Nations General Assembly.

On the other hand, it is beneficial, when local public goods are provided by local governments and not national. Charles Tiebout of the University of Washington argued that competition among communities ensures efficiency in the supply of local public goods, like it does a competition among private subjects in the supply of private goods. Competition between communities arises naturally, because if the citizens of the community do not like, how the public goods are provided to them, they can move to the other community, where they think the provision of public goods is better. Moving from one town to another is naturally much easier than moving to a different country. This argument is called Tiebout hypothesis.

The provision of local public goods by local governments is not always optimal and sometimes federal intervention may be required. The question of which activities should take place at which level of government is called optimal fiscal federalism. Reasons, why federal government might intervenes to the provision of public local goods include market failures and redistribution. Market failures occur because actions of one community have effects on the others (externalities) and similarly as in the market with private goods, competition is not perfect, because there is always a limited number of communities. The problem of redistribution is that with free migration and local competition communities will not redistribute income (to individuals or between communities) or, at most, the redistribution will be limited. From this reason, redistribution is performed by the higher levels of government.

== Grants == 
Federal government redistributes the income to lower levels of government using tools that are called grants. It does so because of several reasons. Local governments have often better information about preferences of local people and costs. Another reason is that the federal government may try to offer states and localities incentives to undertake additional spending, from which will benefit also neighboring communities or the whole country.

The composition of federal grants in the US has changed significantly over the past 50 years. Nowadays, federal grants for health programs represent 65 percent of the total amount of money distributed by federal grants, compared with less than 20 percent in 1980.

There are two main types of federal grants. A matching grant is a grant, which ties the amount of funds provided by the higher level of government to the local community to the amount of spending by the local community. The local state determines the level of expenditure and federal government pays a certain part of the amount. For example, one-for-one matching grant for some specific purpose would provide $1 of funding from a higher level for each $1 paid by lower level. In comparison, when the government provides a block grant, the amount of money paid by government is given and every cost above this number is paid by the local level government. Block grants can be also provided being tied up to any specific use. A grant of some fixed amount with a mandate that money be spent only on some specific purpose is called conditional block grant. In general, grants that are restricted to a particular way of use are called categorical grants.

Matching grants are more effective in encouraging expenditures for specific purpose. They effectively lower the price of certain local public goods. This change pivots the budget constraint outwards. As a result of both income and substitution effect spending on those goods increases. Matching grants have distortionary effect, which means that same utility level as provide these grants can be attained at lower cost with block grants. When a community is offered an unconditional block grant, a lump-sum transfer shifts the budget constraint outwards. Conditional block grants have effects much like a lump sum grant - it makes no difference whether it is given, what should the additional money be used for, so long as the amount of money provided is less than the total desired expenditure. This means that the effect of a conditional block grant will be different from that of an unconditional block grant only if the funded local community would have spent less than the amount of grant without the mandate on how it is to be spent. However, this theory, which says that it does not matter, whether there is a condition or not, might not always be true. Some empirical evidence indicates the presence of a so called &quot;flypaper effect&quot;, which says that the grant leads to significantly greater spending on the desired local public goods.

==Fiscal Federalism Network==
The relationship between central and subcentral government bodies has a profound effect on efficiency and equity within the government and on macroeconomic stability of the country. The role of the OECD Network on Fiscal Relations Across Levels of Government, part of its Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, is to provide data and analysis on these relationships between organizations at different levels of government.

<text>In Belize, the Thomas Vincent Ramos Highway takes up where the Hummingbird Highway ends and runs from Dangriga to Punta Gorda. It is entirely paved, with the completion of a 10-mile segment between Golden Stream and Big Falls circa 2008–09. The T.V. Ramos Highway provides important access to a number of Mayan ruins and natural areas. The ancient Mayan sites of Nim Li Punit and Lubaantun are each situated a few miles west of the highway in southern Belize. The Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary is several miles west of the highway in south-central Belize.

In 2011, a project was initiated, and complete by 2015, to extend the Southern Highway 21.4 mi/34.5 km to Jalacte in southwestern Belize.

On September 30, 2020 the Southern Highway was renamed to Thomas Vincent Ramos Highway. It was named after Thomas Vincent Ramos, the creator of Garifuna Settlement Day.

In 1893, a group of American architects, painters and sculptors met regularly while planning the fine arts section of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The group discussed the idea of forming an American school for artists in Europe as a place for American artists to study and further their skills. Led by Charles F. McKim of architectural practice McKim, Mead &amp; White, they decided that Rome, which they considered a veritable museum of masterpieces of painting, sculpture and architecture throughout the ages, would be the best location for the school. The program began with institutions such as Columbia University and University of Pennsylvania, who would provide scholarships to artists to fund their travel to Rome. In October 1894 the American School of Architecture opened temporarily at the Palazzo Torlonia; directed by Austin W. Lord, it had three fellows, one visiting student, and a library with one volume. In July 1895, the program moved into the larger Villa Aurora. Renting space out to the American School of Classical Studies and the British &amp; American Archeological Society Library, and financial contributions from McKim, allowed for the school to remain open.

In 1895, the American School of Architecture in Rome was incorporated in New York state and 10 shares of capital stock were issued. Despite fund-raising efforts and the American School of Classical Studies pulling out of Villa Aurora, the organization struggled financially. McKim made up for the financial loss with his personal funds. These struggles would cause the American School of Architecture to restructure and base their program on the French Academy. In June 1897, the institution dissolved itself and formed the American Academy in Rome. Among its incorporators was Charles Moore.

The Academy introduced bills to the U.S. Congress to make it a &quot;national institution,&quot; which was successful. In 1904, the Academy moved into Villa Mirafiore, which was soon purchased and renovated. They formed an endowment, which raised over a million dollars, designating those having donated over $100,000 as founders. These founders included McKim, Harvard College, The Carnegie Foundation, J.P. Morgan, J.P. Morgan Jr., John D. Rockefeller Jr., The Rockefeller Foundation, William K. Vanderbilt, Henry Walters, and others. Ever since, the American Academy has always been primarily privately financed. Today, financing comes from private donations as well as grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

In 1912, the American School of Classical Studies in Rome merged with the Academy, giving the Academy two wings: one that focuses on fine art and one, classical studies. Women were a part of the School of Classical Studies, but were not permitted participation in the School of Fine Arts until after World War II. Since 1914, Joseph Brodsky, Aaron Copland, Nadine Gordimer, Thornton Wilder, Mary McCarthy, Philip Guston, Frank Stella, William Styron, Michael Graves, Robert Venturi, Robert Penn Warren, Oscar Hijuelos and Elizabeth Murray, among others, have come to the Academy for inspiration. More recent fellows include artists Firelei Báez, Nari Ward, Rochelle Feinstein, Sanford Biggers, Roberto Lugo and Daniel Joseph Martinez, writers Anthony Doerr, Alexandra Kleeman and Kirstin Valdez Quade, composers Christopher Cerrone, Pamela Z and Andy Akiho, architect Germane Barnes, and filmmaker Garrett Bradley (filmmaker).

In her tenure as president from 1988 and 2013, Adele Chatfield-Taylor, helped restore the Academy&#x27;s McKim, Mead &amp; White building at a cost of $8.2 million and oversaw a capital campaign in which the institution&#x27;s endowment grew to $100 million. She also brought on Alice Waters to create the Rome Sustainable Food Project, which brings chefs from the United States to explore Italian sustainable food traditions and to cook for the Academy guests. Mark Robbins (1997 Fellow) became president and CEO of the Academy in January 2014. His tenure has seen the American Academy in Rome become more diverse and globally facing, and he launched new public programming in the United States. As of July 1, 2023, Peter N. Miller is serving as President of the American Academy in Rome.

== Programs ==
The Academy serves as a &quot;home&quot; to visiting U.S. scholars and artists having been awarded the Rome Prize. Given each year to around 30 (15 artist and 15 scholars) of more than 1,000 applicants, the Rome Prize is awarded for work in the following fields: classical studies, ancient studies, medieval studies, modern Italian studies, architecture, design, historic preservation, art conservation, landscape architecture, musical composition, visual art, and literature. The Rome Prize includes terms that range from six months to two years fellowships at the academy; a stipend ($16,000 for half-year and $30,000 for full-year fellowships); and work and living space at the 11-acre campus.

The 2023/2024 Rome Prize cycle included: Kamrooz Aram, Nao Bustamante, Zachary Fabri, Jeanine Oleson, and Dread Scott.

The American Academy in Rome also has a prestigious residency program, where international leaders in disciplines represented by the Rome Prize are invited to come to the Academy to work and serve as informal mentors. Recent residents have included prominent writers Don Delillo, Ayad Akhtar, André Aciman, Anna Deavere Smith and Jhumpa Lahiri, artists Kara Walker, Yto Barrada, Teresita Fernández, Laurie Anderson, Julie Mehretu and Theaster Gates, designer Michael Bierut, architects Annabelle Selldorf, Jeanne Gang and David Adjaye, composers Nico Muhly, David Lang (composer) (also a Fellow) and Tania León, and scholars Lynn Meskell, Mary Beard (classicist), Shadi Bartsch, David Kertzer, David Nirenberg and David McCullough.

In addition to Rome Prize Fellows and Resident, visiting scholars and artists live and work at the Academy for varying periods.

== Governance and leadership ==

The American Academy in Rome is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that was incorporated by U.S. Congress in 1905 (&quot;An Act of Congress to incorporate the American Academy in Rome&quot;, approved March 3, 1905). Its operations are financed privately, through the support of individual donors, foundations, private colleges and universities, and funds from its endowment. It has a board of trustees.

The American Academy in Rome is led by the President and CEO, Peter N. Miller. Until 1971, the president was an unsalaried position held by the chairmen of the board of trustees. In 1971, the administrative structure was changed in recognition of the need for a professional staff in the U.S., and the position of President and CEO was separated from that of Chair of the Board of Trustees.

Additionally, the American Academy in Rome has a Director in Rome, who reports to the President, which is usually a tenured academic who is &quot;lent&quot; from their home institution to serve as director for a term of three years. Aliza Wong was named director in 2022, becoming the first woman of color to serve as director in the institution&#x27;s 128-year history.

== Site ==

The Academy is housed in several buildings. The main building was designed by the firm of McKim, Mead, and White (their only building in Europe) and opened in 1914. Located under the floor of the basement of the main building lies a segment of the Aqua Traiana that was discovered in 1912–1913. The courtyard has a fountain designed by sculptor Paul Manship. The 2011 Driehaus Prize winner and New Classical architect Michael Graves designed the rare books library in 1996.

The Academy also owns the &quot;Villa Aurelia&quot;, a country estate built for Cardinal Girolamo Farnese in 1650. The building served as Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s headquarters during the French siege of Rome in 1849. The villa was heavily damaged during the assault, but it was restored. It was then purchased by Philadelphia heiress Clara Jessup Heyland. Heyland died in 1909, bequeathing the villa to the Academy in her will.

==Archaeology==
A portion of the aqueduct Aqua Traiana and the ruins of the watermills fed by the aqueduct are on the grounds of the Academy. From the third to the sixth century CE, the Aqua Traiana carried water to operate a number of water mills used for grinding grain, mostly wheat, into flour to make bread, the most important item in the Roman diet. The ancient city of Rome had to import large amounts of grain from Egypt, North Africa, and Sicily to feed its population, estimated at one million people at its peak. The mills on Janiculum Hill and on the site of the Academy were the second largest complex of water mills known in the ancient world. The provision of grain to the residents of Rome was called the Cura Annonae. The aqueduct and the watermills were excavated in the 1990s.

<doc id="574951" wikidata="Q464710" url="?curid=574951" title="American Gladiators (1989 TV series)">
<text>American Gladiators is an American competition television program that aired weekly in syndication from September 1989 to May 1996. The series matched a cast of amateur athletes against each other, as well as against the show&#x27;s own &quot;gladiators&quot;, in contests of strength and agility. Following the success of &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, other countries began to produce their own versions of the show.

==Background and history==
The concept was originally created in 1982 by Johnny C. Ferraro and Dann Carr. Carr gathered the Gladiators and hosted the show, and Ferraro financed and produced the original competition at Erie Tech High School in Erie, Pennsylvania so Ferraro could have the event on film so as to shop the new creation. In 1983 Ferraro financed, developed and packaged the &quot;American Gladiators&quot; as a movie project. In 1984 Carr sold his interest in a literary purchase to Flor-Jon Films. Ferraro had been the main driving force behind the American Gladiators brand since 1982. In 1987, Flor-Jon Films then licensed the unscripted rights to The Samuel Goldwyn Company (now a part of MGM). Ferraro is the sole creator of the 1994 kids&#x27; version of the series, &quot;Gladiators 2000&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;G2&quot;).

An all-star, one-off primetime celebrity special, &quot;Superstar American Gladiators&quot; aired on ABC on May 4, 1995.

Flor-Jon Films, Inc and the Samuel Goldwyn Co in 1993 granted a license to Chariot Entertainment in an effort to launch a live &quot;American Gladiators&quot; show on the Las Vegas Strip, but the president of Chariot became mired in a securities fraud prosecution, through no fault of Flor-Jon Films or The Samuel Goldwyn Co, and the live show went unrealized.

===2008 revival===

MGM Television, the successor company to the Samuel Goldwyn Company, during the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, sold to NBC a prime-time revival that was closer to the British version than the American, with hosts Hulk Hogan and Laila Ali, and Van Earl Wright the play-by-play voice. That version lasted two seasons.

===Potential revivals===
In July 2014, a revival of &quot;American Gladiators&quot; was planned in the works by A. Smith &amp; Co. Productions where it would have incorporated elements that were inspired by the popular film franchise &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; along with mixed martial arts.

In August 2018, MGM Television, with Ferraro and actors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, announced plans to bring &quot;American Gladiators&quot; back again for the 2019–20 season, the 30th anniversary of the franchise&#x27;s television debut.

In September 2021, it was reported that MGM Television has teamed up with WWE (formerly WWF) for a reboot of &quot;American Gladiators&quot; that will feature WWE wrestlers. The project is currently being pitched to broadcasters and streaming platforms.

In April 2024, it was officially reported that the creator of the show, Johnny Ferraro was signed with Range Sports, in plans to potentially remake the show. The decision was accelerated by the success of the BBC’s reboot of the British version in 2024, that has already been confirmed for a second season. A casting call for the remake surfaced on May 4, 2024. A month later, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Amazon Prime Video had ordered the remake.

==Competition==
&quot;American Gladiators&quot; featured four competitors, two men and two women, in most episodes. The players, referred to throughout the series as &quot;contenders&quot;, faced off in a series of physical games against each other and against a cast of costumed athletes looking to prevent them from succeeding (the titular &quot;Gladiators&quot;). Each match saw the competitors trying to advance in a tournament, with one man and one woman crowned champion at its conclusion.

===Initial tournament format===
When the series premiered in the fall of 1989, ten men and ten women were selected to participate with several more chosen to be alternates in case one or more of the contenders had to withdraw due to injury.

The tournament was spread out over the course of twelve episodes. The first five episodes 
comprised the preliminary round of play. Eight contenders would advance from this round to play in the quarterfinals. The five winners from each side would automatically advance, as would the three highest scoring contenders that had not won.

Once the quarterfinal brackets were set, the tournament became single-elimination. Any alternates from here on in would come from the pool of defeated contenders, if they were necessary. The winners of the four quarterfinal matchups were guaranteed a prize, which increased based on how far they advanced. A contender eliminated in the semifinals went home with $2,500. The winner of the final match won $10,000, while the runner-up received $5,000.

Initially, the idea for &quot;American Gladiators&quot; was for the championship winning contenders to become part of the cast of Gladiators for subsequent competitions, a concept that was later adopted for the 2008 sequel series. However, due to the popularity of the initial series of episodes, that idea was done away with. Instead, a second tournament began in early 1990 with a new set of twenty men and women. The two winning contenders from that tournament would then face off with the winners of the initial 1989 tournament in what became known as the Grand Championship, with the winners becoming the overall champions for the season and receiving an additional cash prize as well as a new car.

The second season also used this specific format; the half-season tournament format, with some adjustments as the series progressed, was used until the end of season five.

===Changes===

====Season 3–4====

A total of 48 competitors were selected.

Six preliminary round matchups were played in each half, with the six winners on each side advancing to the quarterfinals. The winners of the three quarterfinal matchups automatically advanced to the semifinals, with the highest scoring contender that did not win their match receiving a wildcard spot. The tournament then continued as before, with the winners of the semifinals facing off to see who would earn a Grand Championship berth.

====Season 5====
32 contenders competed over the course of the season.

For the first time, there were no wildcard spots used in the tournament. Instead, the preliminary round was used for the purposes of seeding, as all eight of the competitors on each side were guaranteed a spot in the quarterfinals, known in this season as the elimination round. After the preliminaries, the contenders were seeded 1-8 based on their performance. The tournament then proceeded as normal.

====Season 6–7====

The tournament format was adjusted to resemble the one used on &quot;Gladiators&quot;, the British adaptation of the series that had premiered in 1992.

Each contender was now competing to not only win their match, but to also be one of the four contenders after all of the matches had been conducted with the highest score. Winning a match earned a contender $2,500. The four highest scoring winners advanced to the semifinals, where a win was worth another $7,500 and a berth in the Grand Championship.

In season six, the Grand Championship winners would each receive an additional $15,000 on top of what they had already won, making their total cash prize out to $25,000. Season seven&#x27;s winners were given an additional $10,000, with their total cash winnings amounting to $20,000. That season&#x27;s Grand Champions were also given berths as the United States representatives in the second &quot;International Gladiators&quot; competition, held at the site of the British series in Birmingham, England.

====The set====
During the first half of the first season, the show&#x27;s set resembled that of an ancient Roman gladiatorial arena, with the stands raised high above the ground. For the second half, the show&#x27;s set was changed into a modern indoor sports arena style. An onscreen clock was added in the second half of the season, which allowed viewers to see how much time a contender had left to complete an event.

The hooded figures that officiated the games were replaced by veteran NFL referee Bob McElwee (No. 95). Starting in Season 2, former Pacific-10 football referee Larry Thompson became the referee. In case of ruling explanations, a host would interview the referee for an explanation.

===Production base===
The first two seasons were recorded on a soundstage at Universal Studios Hollywood. Beginning with the third season and continuing for the rest of the run, the show relocated production to the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles. The studio used to tape the show was referred to on air as “Gladiator Arena”.

===Events===
In each episode, the contenders competed in a series of events. Six to eight events were played per show, varying from season to season. Most of the events tested the contenders&#x27; physical abilities against the superior size and strength of the Gladiators, who were mostly pro or amateur bodybuilders and former football players. In most events, the contenders were not directly pitted against each other, but against the Gladiators. In each event, the contenders earned points based on their performance. In the first half of season one, the points in each event were given in minimum 5-point increments, with 100 points usually the maximum in every event. After the first half of the first season, single point increments were used.

Some events had objectives where each contender had to perform a certain task against the Gladiator, while the Gladiator was trying to do the same thing to them (such as attempting to knock each other off the platforms in Joust). In these types of events, where a clear winner could emerge, contenders were usually awarded ten points for defeating the Gladiator and five points if the event was a draw. No points were awarded to the contender if the Gladiator won.

Other events had no maximum score, with the objective being to perform a task as many times as possible (such as scoring goals in Powerball) within the set time limit for the event. Points in this case would be awarded based on how many times the contender accomplished the objective during the event.

Starting with the fourth season, the final event before The Eliminator, was labeled &quot;Crunch Time&quot;, and was played for more points.

Season six used a format in which events were referred to as &quot;rounds&quot; due to more than one game played per round. Three games per show were played by both males and females and three were split between the males and females, two each in a round. In split rounds the men went first. Including the Eliminator, ten events appeared in each episode, and the lineup of single and split rounds changed during the season. The sole exception to this format was in the semi-finals and grand championship, in which each round was a single event.

There were four lineups used during the season:
The Eliminator was the final event played in each episode, and determined which contender would win that day&#x27;s competition. The contenders competed side-by-side to complete a large obstacle course as quickly as they could. In the first two seasons, the Eliminator had a time limit, and both contenders started the course at the same time. Contenders scored points for every second left on the clock when they finished the course; the contender with the highest final score won the day&#x27;s competition. Beginning in season 3, the contender in the lead was given a head start with each point they led by worth a half-second; the first contender to cross the finish line won.

Of the events that debuted in the show&#x27;s first season, only six lasted the entire original run on American television: Breakthrough and Conquer, The Wall, Joust, Assault, Powerball, and the Eliminator, although The Wall did not debut until the second half of the first season.

===List of gladiators===
==Production==

===Segments===
Throughout the series, &quot;American Gladiators&quot; had several regular segments that were not related to the competition of the day. These segments were used to allow the audience to get to know the Gladiators or to highlight some of the best moments of past competitions.
* Gladiator Moments (Season 3): Gladiators reflect and talk about their favorite moments of the first two seasons of &quot;American Gladiators&quot;.
* Ask a Gladiator (Seasons 3 and 4): Fans write to their favorite American Gladiator asking them questions.
* Csonka&#x27;s Zonks (Season 4): Brief array of clips featuring the funniest moments of the show which includes mostly hits, tackles, and tumbles of the contenders and Gladiators.
* 30 Seconds With: (Seasons 5 and 6): In season 5 Gladiators are asked a number of fill-in-the-blank questions. Then in season 6 the questions were taken away and it was just the Gladiators talking about a random topic.

===Production notes===
The show was taped at Universal Studios Hollywood until 1991, then moved to &quot;Gladiator Arena&quot; (Studio 3) at CBS Studio Center in Studio City for the rest of its initial run. The National Indoor Arena, home to the UK version, hosted the &quot;International Gladiators&quot; competitions.

The series, a co-production of Trans World International and Four Point Entertainment, was distributed by Samuel Goldwyn Television.

The original Pilot was hosted by Fran Tarkenton and Tim Wrightman.

The first 13 episodes were recorded from July 24 to August 5, 1989. The remaining 13 episodes of the first season began production on January 9, 1990. The entire 26 episode second season was recorded in five weeks from June to July 1990.

===Prizes===
During the first half of season one, the intention was to reward the winners by promoting them to the role of American Gladiators, but that reward was never implemented and was abandoned after the first half of the first season.

The show awarded cash prizes depending on how far the contenders advanced. For the first five seasons, $10,000 cash was awarded for winning the half-season finals. Runners-up in these finals were guaranteed $5,000. Contenders that lost in the semi-final rounds were guaranteed $2,500 for advancing that far. Grand Champions received $15,000 more, while the runners up won $10,000 more. In the first two seasons a new 1990 or 1991 Chevrolet automobile of the Grand Champion&#x27;s choice, worth up to $20,000 (vehicle selections included GM vehicles such as the Lumina, Lumina APV, Cavalier, Metro, Tracker, Storm, C/K pickup, Caprice, Suburban, Camaro, Beretta, Blazer, etc.), were awarded to the Grand Champions. In season 3, a 1992 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and in season 4 a 1993 Suzuki Sidekick was awarded to the Grand Champion, and the runner up received a Club Med vacation. The runner up prize was eliminated in the fifth season.

To coincide with the change in tournament structure in season six, contenders won $2,500 for winning matches. Once the competition reached the semifinals, the winners received $10,000. The Grand Champions for that season won an additional $20,000, while the runners-up won an additional $5,000. In season seven, the structure was the same but the Grand Champions won an additional $10,000 for their victories and a berth in the second &quot;International Gladiators&quot; competition.

===Hosts and other personalities===
Joe Theismann and Mike Adamle co-hosted &quot;American Gladiators&quot; during the first half of the first season, with Theismann presiding over the proceedings and Adamle serving more of an analyst&#x27;s role. After Theismann left the series, Adamle became the lead commentator and remained in that role for the remainder of the series. Todd Christensen initially was Adamle&#x27;s replacement as analyst, with Larry Csonka joining the series at the beginning of season two in 1990. Csonka was replaced by Lisa Malosky following the fourth season, and she held the analyst position for seasons five and six. Danny Lee Clark, who spent the first three seasons and most of season six on the show as Gladiator Nitro, became co-host for the final season and was credited on air as Dan &quot;Nitro&quot; Clark.

Adamle also hosted both seasons of &quot;International Gladiators&quot; and was joined by John Fashanu in season one and Ulrika Jonsson and Kimberley Joseph in season two.

A referee wearing an executioner costume appeared during the first half of the first season (portrayed by former football player Jeff Benson). Then-NFL referee Bob McElwee became the referee for the second half of season one. Larry Thompson (a former Pacific-10 Football referee) took over for season two in 1990 and remained until the series ended in 1996. The referees were assisted by several game judges, including Bob Wucetich, Fred Gallagher and Jim Marcione. During &quot;International Gladiators&quot;, Thompson was also joined by the British &quot;Gladiators&quot; referee, John Anderson.

Theismann also was the announcer of the first season and was replaced by legendary game show announcer John Harlan in 1990, who remained with the show until his retirement from announcing in 1993. There was no announcer after that, although Adamle introduced the Gladiators in the final season.

===Champions===
==Reception==

The show was a popular success, but critically panned.

==International broadcasts==
American Gladiators was broadcast in the UK by ITV as part of their &quot;Night Time&quot; slot starting on September 1, 1990. In 1992, ITV debuted their own version called &quot;Gladiators&quot; and in doing so became the first country to adapt &quot;American Gladiators&quot;. 

In Japan, the series aired under the title , and was shown as a sports variety program produced by TV Tokyo aired on its&#x27; affiliated stations from October 16, 1992 to March 1993. It compromises of the series&#x27; footage from its&#x27; heyday, dubbed into Japanese, with exchanges between the hosts of the late Tatsuya Kurama and Reiko Katō respectively. At the end of each episode, Kato would encourage Kurama to join the Gladiators.

==Other ventures==
In 2008, MGM, Reveille and Flor-Jon Films Inc. revealed a special &quot;American Gladiators&quot; U.S. cross-country tour. MGM along with Johnny Ferraro have also put into development a cartoon series based on the show but has never aired.

In 2009, Johnny Ferraro wanted to bring a live-action movie of &quot;American Gladiators&quot;. Former Legendary Pictures chief marketing officer Scott Mednick was producing the film where the goal was to create an action story that takes place inside the world Ferraro created.

===Reruns===
USA Network was the first network to air reruns of &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, acquiring a total of 104 episodes. In 1992, USA began airing episodes daily in the late afternoon following its game show rerun lineup and preceding &quot;Cartoon Express&quot;, and later moved the episodes to air as part of its mid-morning lineup. The network initially had rights to the first three seasons and picked up rights to the fourth when it finished airing in 1993, but did not pick up any additional seasons beyond that. USA aired reruns through at least 1996, just as the show ended its original run.

Spike TV purchased a rerun package they began airing during their last days as The National Network in 2002. Originally airing weekday afternoons and late night Saturdays, Spike eventually scaled back the reruns to the late Saturday airing and then dropped them in 2003. Spike was only given rights to seasons two through four in their entirety, special episodes from seasons five and six, season seven in its entirety, and both editions of &quot;International Gladiators&quot; in their entirety.

In 2007, ESPN added the entire original series to ESPN Classic&#x27;s lineup. This meant that the non-specials from seasons five and six saw their first airings since their respective seasons and the first season, including the episodes under the original format, would be seen for the first time since USA carried the series. ESPN Classic briefly pulled the original &quot;American Gladiators&quot; series from its lineup shortly after a revival premiered in 2008, but returned it after the revival concluded. ESPN permanently removed the show from ESPN Classic in 2009.

In 2017, after an absence from television lasting several years, &quot;American Gladiators&quot; reruns returned to the air with the launch of the Sinclair Broadcast Group&#x27;s action-themed broadcast network Charge!. Edited reruns of the UK Gladiators series were also added. As of 2020, both shows are no longer on the Charge! schedule.

As of April 2018, SI TV (Sports Illustrated TV) has added the original series to their premium channel add on for Amazon Prime.

In October 2019, a channel dedicated to the original show, as well as the 2008 revival was added to Pluto TV on channel 136, later channel 303. Episodes spanned the entire run of both shows, with only the &quot;International Gladiators&quot; episodes absent. On October 1, 2021, the channel was removed from the lineup. Several episodes are available for download on Apple&#x27;s iTunes Service.

===Broadband website===
On January 28, 2008, a broadband website will pay homage to the original series called &quot;americangladiators.com&quot; where it features clip of the original which all have been re-digitalized as clips would reintroduce original Gladiators and give fans an update on where they are today. Future segments would also include &quot;Best Hits&quot; and stunts that were performed on the show.

===&quot;30 for 30&quot;===
On April 12, 2021, it was announced that an upcoming documentary film about &quot;American Gladiators&quot; for the ESPN series &quot;30 for 30&quot; was going to be produced by Vice Studios and ESPN Films and would directed by Ben Berman and co-directed by Kirk Johnson. After two years in development, on April 21, 2023, it was announced that the two-part documentary film will be called &quot;The American Gladiators Documentary&quot; premiering May 30 and 31 on ESPN, and will be available on its streaming service ESPN+ immediately after its premiere.

===Muscles &amp; Mayhem===

In 2023 Netflix released a documentary on American gladiators called Muscles &amp; Mayhem: An Unauthorized Story of American Gladiators.

===Home media===
On July 14, 2009 Shout! Factory released &quot;The Battle Begins&quot;, featuring commentary from the Lazer, Zap, and Nitro, and an interview with Billy Wirth. This DVD only has the last 14 episodes of season one (the mid-season recap, and the second half of season one).

===Soundtrack===
In 1993, &quot;American Gladiators: The Music&quot; was released by DCC Compact Classics/Sandstone Music, featuring songs used on the show, Dan Milner&#x27;s music for the games and the opening and closing themes by Bill Conti.

===&quot;American Gladiators Orlando Live!&quot;===
In 1995, &quot;American Gladiators&quot; performed a dinner show in Orlando, Florida. This dinner show featured Dallas, Laser, Hawk, Ice, Jazz, Nitro, Sabre, Siren, Sky, Tower, and Turbo from the TV show along with the new Gladiators Apache, Cobra, Electra, Flame, Flash, Jade, Quake, Rage, Raven, Tank, Thor, Tigra, Titan, Viper.

<doc id="574963" wikidata="Q3001949" url="?curid=574963" title="Soft-shell crab">
<text>Soft-shell crab is a culinary term for crabs that have recently molted their old exoskeleton and are still soft. Soft-shells are removed from the water as soon as they molt or, preferably, just before to prevent any hardening of their shell. Catching soft-shell crab is very time-sensitive and requires that any caught crabs be kept in climate-controlled areas immediately after catching until they molt, at which point they can be safely removed and sold.

This means that almost the entire animal can be eaten, rather than having to shell the animal to reach the meat. The exceptions are the mouthparts, the gills and the abdominal cover, which are discarded (&quot;cleaned&quot;). The remaining, edible part of the crab is typically deep-fried or sautéed.

==Regional cuisine==

In the United States, the main species is the blue crab, &quot;Callinectes sapidus&quot;, which appears in markets from April to September.

In the Deep South region of the United States, most notably the Gulf coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, &quot;Buster crab&quot; can be a synonym for a plump, meaty soft-shell crab. (&quot;Buster Crabbe&quot; was a famous movie star, known for playing Flash Gordon). However, the original meaning of Buster crab referred to either a soft-shell that had yet to complete molting, or to a soft-shell that had died before being provided to a seafood vendor, and was then consumed quickly by the crabbers.

In Japan, various species are used to make sushi such as &quot;maki-zushi&quot; or &quot;temaki-zushi&quot;. The Japanese blue crab (&quot;Portunus trituberculatus&quot;) or the shore swimming crab (&quot;Charybdis japonica&quot;) are typically used. 

In Spain, soft-shell crustaceans are typical in the coastal region of Andalusia. Irrespective of the species, they are called &quot;chiguatos&quot;, from the local slang verb &quot;achiguatar&quot;, meaning &quot;to soften&quot;. Typical preparations include velvet crabs (&quot;Necora puber&quot;) and langoustines (&quot;Nephrops norvegicus&quot;), which are highly regarded delicacies of Sanlucar de Barrameda, and lobster (&quot;Homarus gammarus&quot;) (called &quot;langosta chiguata&quot;), which is typical along the coast of Málaga. Typically, they are deep-fried and served with a vinaigrette.

In Italy, the soft-shell of the common Mediterranean crab is a delicacy typical of the Venetian lagoon (called &quot;moeca&quot; or &quot;moeche&quot; in the local idiom).

Soft-shell crabs can have the soft organs along the dorsal cavity removed during cleaning, or they can be left in for consumption. In the latter case, along the US Atlantic coast, the customer asks the vendor to leave &quot;the mustard&quot;, referring to the yellow-orange color of the hepatopancreas, and the deep orange of the roe in a female crab.

<text>A motorboat or powerboat is a boat that is exclusively powered by an engine; faster examples may be called &quot;speedboats&quot;.

Some motorboats are fitted with inboard engines, others have an outboard motor installed on the rear, containing the internal combustion engine, the gearbox and the propeller in one portable unit. An inboard-outboard contains a hybrid of an inboard and an outboard, where the internal combustion engine is installed inside the boat, and the gearbox and propeller are outside.

There are two configurations of an inboard, V-drive and direct drive. A direct drive has the powerplant mounted near the middle of the boat with the propeller shaft straight out the back, where a V-drive has the powerplant mounted in the back of the boat facing backwards having the shaft go towards the front of the boat then making a &quot;V&quot; towards the rear. 
==Overview==
A motorboat is a small craft with one or more engines for propulsion. Motorboats are commonly used for work, recreation, sport, or racing.

Boat engines vary in shape, size, and type. These include inboard, outboard (integrating, the engine, gearbox, and propeller in one portable unit mounted in the rear), and inboard-outboard (or “sterndrive”, which mounts the engine inboard and the rest outboard).

Fuel types include gasoline, diesel, gas turbine, rotary combustion or steam.

High performance speedboats can reach speeds of over 50 knots. Their high speed and performance can be attributed to their hull technology and engine. With a more powerful and heavier engine, an appropriate hull shape is needed. High performance boats include yachts, HSIC (high speed interceptor craft) and racing powerboats.

A V-type hull helps a boat cut through the water. A deep V-hull helps keep the boat&#x27;s bow down at low speeds, improving visibility. V-hulls also improve a boat&#x27;s speed and maneuvering capabilities. They stabilize a boat in rough conditions.

==History==

===Invention===

Although the screw propeller had been added to an engine (steam engine) as early as the 18th century in Birmingham, England, by James Watt, boats powered by a petrol engine only came about in the later part of the 19th century with the invention of the internal combustion engine.

The earliest boat to be powered by a petrol engine was tested on the Neckar River by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in 1886, when they tested their new &quot;longcase clock&quot; engine. It had been constructed in the former greenhouse (converted into a workshop) in Daimler&#x27;s back yard. The first public display took place on the Waldsee in Cannstatt, today a suburb of Stuttgart, at the end of that year. The engine of this boat had a single cylinder of 1 horse power. Daimler&#x27;s second launch in 1887 had a second cylinder positioned at an angle of 15 degrees to the first one, and was known as the &quot;V-type&quot;.

The first successful motor boat was designed by the Priestman Brothers in Hull, England, under the direction of William Dent Priestman. The company began trials of their first motorboat in 1888. The engine was powered with kerosene and used an innovative high-tension (high voltage) ignition system. The company was the first to begin large scale production of the motor boat, and by 1890, Priestman&#x27;s boats were successfully being used for towing goods along canals.

Another early pioneer was Mr. J. D. Roots, who in 1891 fitted a launch with an internal combustion engine and operated a ferry service between Richmond and Wandsworth along the River Thames during the seasons of 1891 and 1892.
The eminent inventor Frederick William Lanchester recognized the potential of the motorboat and over the following 15 years, in collaboration with his brother George, perfected the modern motorboat, or powerboat. Working in the garden of their home in Olton, Warwickshire, they designed and built a river flat-bottomed launch with an advanced high-revving engine that drove via a stern paddle wheel in 1893. In 1897, he produced a second engine similar in design to his previous one but running on benzene at 800 r.p.m. The engine drove a reversible propeller. An important part of his new engine was the revolutionary carburettor, for mixing the fuel and air correctly. His invention was known as a &quot;wick carburetor&quot;, because fuel was drawn into a series of wicks, from where it was vaporized. He patented this invention in 1905.

The Daimler Company began production of motor boats in 1897 from its manufacturing base in Coventry. The engines had two cylinders and the explosive charge of petroleum and air was ignited by compression into a heated platinum tube. The engine gave about six horse-power. The petrol was fed by air pressure to a large surface carburettor and also an auxiliary tank which supplied the burners for heating the ignition tubes. Reversal of the propeller was effected by means of two bevel friction wheels which engaged with two larger bevel friction wheels, the intermediate shaft being temporarily disconnected for this purpose. It was not until 1901 that a safer apparatus for igniting the fuel with an electric spark was used in motor boats.

===Expansion===

Interest in fast motorboats grew rapidly in the early years of the 20th century. The Marine Motor Association was formed in 1903 as an offshoot of the Royal Automobile Club. &quot;Motor Boat &amp; Yachting&quot; was the first magazine to address technical developments in the field and was brought out by Temple Press, London from 1904. Large manufacturing companies, including Napier &amp; Son and Thornycroft began producing motorboats.

===Early racing===
The first motorboating competition was established by Alfred Charles William Harmsworth in 1903. The Harmsworth Cup was envisioned as a contest between nations, rather than between boats or individuals. The boats were originally to be designed and built entirely by residents of the country represented, using materials and units built wholly within that country.

The first competition, held in July 1903, at Cork Harbour in Ireland, and officiated by the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland and the Royal Victoria Yacht Club, was a very primitive affair, with many boats failing even to start. The competition was won by Dorothy Levitt in a Napier launch designed to the specifications of Selwyn Edge. This motorboat was the first proper motorboat designed for high speed. She set the world&#x27;s first water speed record when she achieved in a steel-hulled, 75-horsepower Napier speedboat fitted with a three-blade propeller. As both the owner and entrant of the boat, &quot;S. F. Edge&quot; was engraved on the trophy as the winner.
An article in the &quot;Cork Constitution&quot; on 13 July reported &quot;A large number of spectators viewed the first mile from the promenade of the Yacht Club, and at Cork several thousand people collected at both sides of the river to see the finishes.&quot; Levitt was then commanded to the Royal yacht of King Edward VII where he congratulated her on her pluck and skill, and they discussed the performance of the motorboat and its potential for British government despatch work.

France won the race in 1904, and the boat &quot;Napier II&quot; set a new world water speed record for a mile at almost 30 knots (56 km/h), winning the race in 1905.

The acknowledged genius of motor boat design in America was the naval architect John L. Hacker. His pioneering work, including the invention of the V-hull and the use of dedicated petrol engines revolutionized boat design from as early as 1908, when he founded the Hacker Boat Co. In 1911, Hacker designed the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, the first successful step hydroplane which exceeded the then-unthinkable speed of and was at that time the fastest boat in the world. The Harmsworth Cup was first won by Americans in 1907. The US and England traded it back and forth until 1920. From 1920 to 1933, Americans had an unbroken winning streak. Gar Wood won this race eight times as a driver and nine times as an owner between 1920 and 1933.

== Hull type ==
From a design point of view, a boat’s hull type reflects its use and the waters it will be used it. These include displacement hulls, vee-bottom hulls, modified vee-bottom hulls, deep-vee hulls and trim tabs for vee-bottom hulls. The three main hull materials are wood, reinforced fiberglass and metal. Wood hulls may be made of planks or plywood. Fiberglass hulls are reinforced with balsa wood. Metal hulls are either aluminum or steel.
Some gross configurations of motorboats include skiff, day cruiser, bow rider, pilothouse and cabin cruiser. These vary by such considerations as size, whether they have a deck, cabin, head, is sail, helm position, and additional seating.

<text>The U Sports Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship, branded as the Men&#x27;s Basketball Final 8, is a Canadian university basketball tournament conducted by U Sports, and determines the men&#x27;s national champion. The tournament involves the champions from each of Canada&#x27;s four regional sports conferences. The W. P. McGee trophy is awarded to the winners.

Twenty different schools have won the tournament. Carleton University have the most tournament wins with 17 championships. The University of Victoria has eight championships, Saint Mary’s University, Brandon University, and the University of Windsor have four championships, the University of Alberta, St. Francis Xavier University, and Acacia University have three championships, Brock University, and the University of British Columbia have two championships. Eleven programs are tied with one national championship.

==History==

Assumption University has the distinction of originating the national championship trophy. In 1963, the University of Windsor Alumni Association donated the award featuring a silver basketball, and named in memory of W.P. McGee for his outstanding contribution as both teacher and coach during the 1920s and 1930s. Assumption won the first McGee trophy, the only time it took the national title under the Assumption name. The University of Windsor would win it four times in that same decade (1960s). For more than 60 years, the McGee trophy has been awarded annually to the U Sports men&#x27;s basketball champion.

The tournament first consisted of only conference champions (four or five teams) and held that format from 1963 until 1971. In 1972 and 1973, only four teams qualified, regardless of conferences. In 1974, the championship expanded to include eight teams, similar to the format seen today. That was again changed in 1983 where regional championships took place with up to 16 teams participating in up to five different cities with the national championship featuring four teams in the main host city.

In 1984, Dalhousie University hosted the championship in what would be the first of 24 straight years that Halifax, Nova Scotia would host. The format reverted to an eight team national championship in 1987, which would be the consistent format until 2004 when the tournament expanded to ten teams. The Final 10 format would last only three years, until it was again reverted to a Final 8 tournament in 2007. In 2008, the finals moved to Scotiabank Place in Ottawa for three years. After two years back in Halifax, the next two tournaments were held in the now renamed Canadian Tire Centre (formerly Scotiabank Place). The 2015 championship was hosted by Ryerson University, while the 2016 tournament was hosted by the University of British Columbia.

The 2021 championship tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Format==
The championship consists of an eight-team single-elimination tournament. Four teams automatically qualify for the tournament as one of the winners of the four conferences, two qualify as the runners-up of both the OUA and Canada West conference, one qualifies as the host, and one is given an at-large berth.

The tournament is played over four days. The quarterfinals are played on the Thursday, the consolation semi-finals on Friday, the consolation final and championship semi-finals on Saturday, and the bronze and gold medal games on Sunday. This format has been in use since 2015.

<doc id="574967" wikidata="Q7713728" url="?curid=574967" title="The Andy Williams Show">
<text>The Andy Williams Show is an American television variety show hosted by singer Andy Williams that ran from 1962 to 1971 (alternating during the summer of 1970 with &quot;Andy Williams Presents Ray Stevens&quot;). It became a half-hour syndicated series beginning in the fall of 1976.

== Series regulars ==

&quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; featured a number of regular performers including: 
* Dick Van Dyke (1958)
* The New Christy Minstrels (1962-1963)
* R.G. Brown (1962)
* Marian Mercer (1962)
* The Osmond Brothers (1962-1971) 
* Jonathan Winters (1965-1967, 1970-1971)

* Professor Irwin Corey (1969-1970)
* Ray Stevens (1969-1971)
* The Lennon Sisters (1970-1971)
* Charlie Callas (1970-1971)
* Janos Prohaska (The Cookie Bear) (1969-1971)

==Series synopsis==
The first series began as a summer replacement on ABC in 1958 and on CBS in 1959. The weekly year-round series premiered on NBC in 1962, where it ran until 1967, when Williams reduced his workload to three specials a year. He returned to having a weekly series from 1969 through 1971.

At the beginning of the weekly series The New Christy Minstrels were the backup singers, but on December 20, 1962 The Osmond Brothers appeared on the show, and they became the regular backup performers for the rest of the series run.

In 1967 Williams decided to cut back to three specials per year. However, two years later he returned to weekly television in a revised format that included rock and roll acts and psychedelic lighting.

Starting with the 1969 season more emphasis was placed on comedy. Hungarian acrobat and stuntman Janos Prohaska began appearing in a bear costume, asking for cookies. The bear never got any cookies in the series, but fans began mailing baked goods to Prohaska.

Five years after his second weekly run at NBC had ended, Williams hosted a half-hour syndicated weekly variety show with Wayland Flowers and orchestra leader George Wyle.

<text>Darshana () is a border railway station in Darsana, Bangladesh, situated in Damurhuda Upazila of Chuadanga District, in Khulna Division. It is a rail transit point and a border checkpoint on the India-Bangladesh border.

==History==
Darshana to Jagotee, Kushtia rail line was first opened on 15 November 1861. It was long broad gauge line. It is the first rail road in East Bengal. This rail road established sugarcane supply chain between Darsana (Carew) and Jagotee Sugar mills. Later on this rail road was extended up to Goalundo Ghat. 
Darshana - Rana Ghat (India) -Benapole -Jessore -Khulna passenger railway communication continued until the early 1960s between East Pakistan and India. Then Darshana to Jessore railway was established and the service discontinued.
Darsana station came up with the Eastern Bengal Railway opening the line from Calcutta to Goalundo Ghat, in 1871.

The Maitree Express passes through this station.

<doc id="574980" wikidata="Q1146067" url="?curid=574980" title="Dizi (instrument)">
<text>The dizi (, pronounced ), is a Chinese transverse flute. It is also sometimes known as the &quot;di&quot; () or &quot;héngdi&quot; (), and has varieties including Qudi (), Bangdi (), and Xindi (). It is a major Chinese musical instrument that is widely used in many genres of Chinese folk music, Chinese opera, as well as the modern Chinese orchestra. The &quot;dizi&quot; is also a popular instrument among the Chinese people as it is simple to make and easy to carry.

Most &quot;dizi&quot; are made of bamboo, which explains why &quot;dizi&quot; are sometimes known by simple names such as Chinese [[bamboo flute]]. However, &quot;bamboo&quot; is perhaps more of a Chinese instrument classification like &quot;woodwind&quot; in the West. Northern Chinese &quot;dizi&quot; are made from purple or violet bamboo, while &quot;dizi&quot; made in Suzhou and Hangzhou are made from white bamboo. &quot;Dizi&quot; produced in southern Chinese regions such as Chaozhou are often made of very slender, lightweight, light-colored bamboo and are much quieter in tone.

Although bamboo is the common material for the &quot;dizi&quot;, it is also possible to find &quot;dizi&quot; made from other kinds of wood, or even from stone. Jade &quot;dizi&quot; (or ) are popular among both collectors interested in their beauty, and among professional players who seek an instrument with looks to match the quality of their renditions; however, jade may not be the best material for &quot;dizi&quot; since, as with metal, jade may not be as tonally responsive as bamboo, which is more resonant.

The &quot;dizi&quot; is not the only bamboo flute of China. Other Chinese bamboo wind instruments include the vertical end-blown xiao and the koudi.

==History==

Recently, archaeologists have discovered evidence suggesting that the simple transverse flutes (though without the distinctive &quot;mokong&quot; of the &quot;dizi&quot;) have been present in China for over 9,000 years. Fragments of bone flutes from this period are still playable today, and are remarkably similar to modern versions in terms of hole placement, etc. The Jiahu neolithic site in central Henan province of China has yielded flutes dating back to 7,000 BC – 5,000 BC that could represent the earliest playable instruments ever found. These flutes were carved with five to eight holes, and are capable of producing sounds that roughly span an octave. The &quot;dizi&quot; as we know it today roughly dates to the 5th century BC, and there have been examples of bamboo &quot;dizi&quot; that date back to 2nd century BC.

These flutes share common features with other simple flutes from cultures all around the world. Multiple examples from different cultures consist of a drilled piece of bone, which is well-suited as a material due to its hollow nature. The earliest known examples of bone flutes date back around 42,000 years ago.

===Modern modifications===
Traditionally &quot;dizi&quot; is made by using a single piece of bamboo. While simple and straightforward, it is also impossible to change the fundamental tuning once the bamboo is cut, which made it a problem when it was played with other instruments in a modern Chinese orchestra. In the 1920s musician Zheng Jinwen (, 1872–1935) resolved this issue by inserting a copper joint to connect two pieces of shorter bamboo. This method allows the length of the bamboo to be modified for minute adjustment to its fundamental pitch.

On traditional &quot;dizi&quot; the finger-holes are spaced approximately equidistant, which produces a temperament of mixed whole-tone and three-quarter-tone intervals. Zheng also repositioned the figure-holes to change the notes produced. During the middle of the 20th century &quot;dizi&quot; makers further changed the finger hole placements to allow for playing in equal temperament, as demanded by new musical developments and compositions, although the traditional &quot;dizi&quot; continue to be used for purposes such as &quot;kunqu&quot; accompaniment.

In the 1930s, an 11-hole, fully chromatic version of the &quot;dizi&quot; was created called the &quot;xindi&quot; (), pitched in the same range as the western flute. However, the modified dizi&#x27;s extra tone holes prevent the effective use of the membrane, so this instrument lacks the inherent timbre of the traditional &quot;dizi&quot; family.

While the &quot;bangdi&quot; (pitched in the same range as western piccolo) and &quot;qudi&quot; (pitched a fourth or fifth lower than the &quot;bangdi&quot;) are the most prevalent, other &quot;dizi&quot; include the &quot;xiaodi&quot;/&quot;gaoyindi&quot; (pitched a fourth or fifth higher than the &quot;bangdi&quot;), the &quot;dadi&quot;/&quot;diyindi&quot; (pitched a fourth or fifth lower than &quot;qudi&quot;), and the &quot;deidi&quot;/&quot;diyindadi&quot; (pitched an octave lower than &quot;qudi&quot;.)

==Membrane==
Whereas most simple flutes have only a blowing hole (known as &quot;chui kong&quot; () in Chinese) and finger-holes, the &quot;dizi&quot; has a very different additional hole, called a &quot;mo kong&quot; (), between the embouchure and finger-holes. A special membrane called &quot;dimo&quot; (, lit. &quot;&quot;di&quot; membrane&quot;), made from an almost tissue-like shaving of reed (made from the inner skin of bamboo cells), is made taut and glued over this hole, traditionally with a substance called &quot;ejiao&quot;, an animal glue. Garlic juice may also be used to adhere the &quot;dimo&quot;, but it is not recommended as a permanent replacement. This application process, in which fine wrinkles are created in the centre of the &quot;dimo&quot; to create a penetrating buzzy timbre, is an art form in itself.

The &quot;dimo&quot;-covered &quot;mo kong&quot; has a distinctive resonating effect on the sound produced by the &quot;dizi&quot;, making it brighter and louder, and adding harmonics to give the final tone a buzzing, nasal quality. &quot;Dizi&quot; have a relatively large range, covering about two-and-a-quarter octaves.

==Playing styles and techniques==

Contemporary &#x27;dizi&#x27; styles or schools based on the professional conservatory repertory are divided into two: Northern and Southern, each style having different preferences in &quot;dizi&quot; and playing techniques, with different methods for embellishment and ornamentation of the melody.
* Northern school (Beipai) – The &quot;dizi&quot; used for the Northern school, the &quot;bangdi&quot;, is shorter and higher in pitch, and its sound quality is brighter and more shrill. In Northern China, it is used in &quot;kunqu&quot; and &quot;bangzi&quot; opera, and as well as regional musical genres such as &quot;errentai&quot;. &quot;Dizi&quot; music of the Northern school is characterized by a fast, rhythmic and virtuosic playing, employing techniques such as glissando, tremolo, flutter tonguing, and fast tonguing.
* Southern school (Nanpai) – In Southern China, the qudi is the lead melodic instrument of &quot;kunqu&quot; opera and is also used in music such as &quot;Jiangnan sizhu&quot;. It is longer, and has a more mellow, lyrical tone. The music of the Southern school is usually slower, and the ornamentations are predominantly short melodic turns, trills, and appoggiatura or grace note.
&quot;Dizi&quot; are often played using various &quot;advanced&quot; techniques, such as circular breathing, slides, popped notes, harmonics, &quot;flying finger&quot; trills, multiphonics, fluttertonguing, and double-tonguing, which are also common in similar instruments, such as the western concert flute and recorder. Most professional players have a set of seven &quot;dizi&quot;, each in a different key (and size). Additionally, master players and those seeking distinctive sounds such as birdsong may use extremely small or very large &quot;dizi&quot;.

==Performers==

There have been several major performers of the 20th century who have contributed to &quot;dizi&quot; playing in the new conservatory professional concert repertory, often based on or adapted from regional folk styles. Following the Chinese Communist Revolution, and according to the Yan&#x27;an forum talks, the instrument was appreciated for its popular roots, and used extensively in revolutionary music.

Feng Zicun (, 1904–1987) was born in Yangyuan, Hebei province. Of humble origins, Feng had established himself as a folk musician by the time of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, playing the &quot;dizi&quot; as well as the four-string fiddle &quot;sihu&quot; in local song and dance groups, folksongs and stilt dances. He also introduced &quot;Errentai&quot;, the local opera of Inner Mongolia, to Hebei after spending four years there as a musician in the 1920s.

In 1953, Feng was appointed to the state-supported Central Song and Dance Ensemble in Beijing as &quot;dizi&quot; soloist, and accepted a teaching post at the China Conservatory of Music (Beijing) in 1964.

Feng adapted traditional folk ensemble pieces into dizi solos, such as &quot;Xi xiang feng&quot; (Happy Reunion), &quot;Wu bangzi&quot; (Five Clappers), contributing to the new Chinese conservatory curricula in traditional instrument performance. Feng’s style, virtuosic and lively, has been known as representative of the folk musical traditions of northern China.

Liu Guanyue (, 1918–1990) was born in An&#x27;guo county, Hebei. Born to a poor peasant family, Liu was a professional folk musician who had earned a meagre living playing the &quot;guanzi&quot;, &quot;suona&quot;, and &quot;dizi&quot; in rural ritual ensembles before becoming a soloist in the Tianjin Song-and-Dance Ensemble &quot;(Tianjin gewutuan)&quot; in 1952.

Liu together with Feng Zicun are said to be representatives of the Northern &quot;dizi&quot; style. His pieces, including &quot;Yin zhong niao&quot; (Birds in the Shade), &quot;He ping ge&quot; (Doves of Peace) and &quot;Gu xiang&quot; (Old Home village) have become part of the new conservatory professional concert repertory.
Lu Chunling (, 1921–2018) was born in Shanghai. In pre-1949 Shanghai, Lu worked a trishaw driver, but was also an amateur musician, performing the Jiangnan sizhu folk ensemble repertory. In 1952, Lu became &quot;dizi&quot; soloist with the Shanghai Folk Ensemble &quot;(Shanghai minzu yuetuan)&quot;, and also at the Shanghai Opera Company &quot;(Shanghai geju yuan)&quot; from 1971 to 1976. In 1957 he taught at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and became associate professor in 1978.

Lu has performed in many countries as well as throughout China and has made many recordings. His &quot;dizi&quot; playing style has become representative of the Jiangnan &quot;dizi&quot; tradition in general. He is well known as a longtime member of the famous &quot;Jiangnan sizhu&quot; music performance quartet consisting of Lu Chunling, Zhou Hao, Zhou Hui, and Ma Shenglong. His compositions include &quot;Jinxi&quot; (Today and Yesterday).

Zhao Songting (, 1924–2001) was born in Dongyang county, Zhejiang. Zhao trained as a teacher in Zhejiang, and studied law and Chinese and Western music in Shanghai. In the 1940s he worked as a music teacher in Zhejiang, and became the &quot;dizi&quot; soloist in the Zhejiang Song and Dance Ensemble (&quot;Zhejiang Sheng Gewutuan&quot;) in 1956. He also taught at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music and the Zhejiang College of Arts (&quot;Zhejiang Sheng Yishu Xuexiao&quot;).

Because of his middle-class background, Zhao suffered in the political campaigns of the 1950s and 1960s and was not allowed to perform, instead he taught many students who went on to become leading professional &quot;dizi&quot; players, and to refine &quot;dizi&quot; design. He was reinstated in his former positions in 1976.

Zhao&#x27;s compositions include &quot;San Wu Qi&quot; (Three-Five-Seven), which is based on a melody from &quot;Wuju&quot; (Zhejiang traditional opera).

Yu Xunfa (, 1946–2006) was a prominent &quot;dizi&quot; soloist and composer from Shanghai. He performed with the Shanghai National Orchestra and served as Head of the Chinese Dizi Culture Research Centre of Shanghai. The State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China gave him a Life Achievement Award as well as a Lifelong Special Allowance from the State. He is also known for having invented the &quot;koudi&quot; in 1971.

Ma Di (馬迪) is a current composer and soloist known for his technique on the instrument.

Tang Junqiao (唐俊乔) is a practitioner with international performances alongside Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, and London Symphony Orchestra, as well as in movie &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;.

==Use in other music genres==

Ron Korb ( or phonetically translated to &quot;&quot;), born in Toronto, Canada, is the first renowned western musician playing &quot;dizi&quot; along with numerous other world woodwinds. He graduated from the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto with an honors degree in performance. On many of his recordings, he uses the &quot;dizi&quot; as the lead instrument. He has also used &quot;dizi&quot; in the film soundtracks of &quot;The White Countess&quot;, &quot;Relic Hunter&quot;, &quot;China Rises&quot;, and &quot;Long Life, Happiness, &amp; Prosperity&quot;.

<text>Personal lubricants (colloquially termed lube) are specialized lubricants used during sexual acts, such as intercourse and masturbation, to reduce friction to or between the penis and vagina, anus or other body parts, or applied to sex toys to reduce friction or to ease penetration. As of 2015, the personal lubricant market was estimated to be worth at least $400 million.

Surgical or medical lubricants or gels, which are similar to personal lubricants but not usually referred to or labelled as &quot;personal&quot; lubricants, may be used for medical purposes such as speculum insertion or introduction of a catheter. The primary difference between personal and surgical lubricants is that surgical lubricants are thicker, sterile gels, typically containing a bacteriostatic agent.

==Types==
===By composition===
====Water-based====
Water-based personal lubricants are water-soluble and are the most widely used personal lubricants. The earliest water-based lubricants were cellulose ether or glycerin solutions. Products available today may have various agents added for even dispersal, moisture retention, and resistance to contamination. The viscosity of these products can be altered by adjusting their water content and concentration of cellulose or other gel-forming hydrophilic ingredient. Because water-based personal lubricants absorb into the skin and evaporate, most water-based lubricants have a tendency to dry out during use, but reapplication of the lubricant or application of water or saliva is usually sufficient to reactivate them. When the lubricant eventually dries out, it may leave behind a residue derived from the other ingredients in the formulation. This may require reapplication during sex, and/or removal of the residue with water. Scientists are testing whether anti-retroviral lubricants or gels can be applied to aid in the prevention of transmission of HIV.

Typical water-based lubricants may be incompatible with sex acts that occur in water (such as in a bathtub, pool, or hot tub) as they can be dissolved or dispersed in water.

The Population Council, in a 2011 study, tested commercially available water-based sexual lubricants, and found that many damaged human rectal cells and that some of them – those containing polyquaternium-15 – appeared to actively increase HIV replication in cell cultures and therefore could raise one&#x27;s risk of HIV transmission. Water-based &#x27;lubes&#x27; have been recommended for use in safer sex because they do not weaken condoms like oil-based lubricants do. The researchers concluded: &quot;Since it is the condom that is protecting users from HIV rather than the lube, condom users should still be encouraged to use water-based lubes because condoms are also more likely to break, and trauma to the rectal lining occur, with no lube&quot;. They also cited silicone-based lubricants as a potential alternative, although they did not test any silicone lubes in their study.

A later study has validated the findings of the Population Council for some water-based products&#x27; hyper-osmolality causing some human&#x27;s cells damage, and better bio-compatibility with low-osmolality water-based products and silicone-based products but failed to corroborate polyquaternium 15 having a role that binds HIV to rectal cells or increase HIV replication.

====Oil-based====
Oil-based lubricants, for example petroleum-based lubricants (such as petroleum jelly), can increase the likelihood of breakage and slipping of latex condoms due to loss of elasticity caused by these lubricants. Oil-based lubricants may be considered desirable for people who are in relationships not requiring condom use and who wish to avoid certain additives and preservatives often found in other lubricants.

====Silicone-based====
Silicone-based lubricants do not contain any water. They offer a different feel from water-based personal lubricants. Silicone-based lubricants are not absorbed by skin or mucous membranes and consequently last longer than water-based lubricants. Many different silicone lubricants are commercially available, with varying quality and performance. Not all silicone-based lubricants are &quot;certified&quot; latex-safe, but silicone-based lubricants have not been shown to increase the risk of HIV transmission during anal intercourse, as some water-based lubes have.

Silicone-based lubricants are not usually recommended for use with sex toys or other products that are made from silicone because the formula may dissolve the surface, making it sticky to the touch, and cause disintegration of the item over time. This damage may create a breeding ground for bacteria. In most cases, a warning is listed on the product label. Silicone-based lubricant is also used in the manufacture of pre-lubricated condoms, due to its long-lasting properties and superior latex compatibility.

===By usage===
====Vaginal lubricants====
Vaginal lubricants are used to augment vaginal lubrication and reduce vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse, and by couples trying to conceive. During fertility interventions, the use of a lubricant eases sperm specimen collection by masturbation. Commonly used lubricants include saliva, oil (such as baby oil, olive oil, canola oil, or mineral oil) or commercially available lubricants that are either water-based or hydroxyethylcellulose-based.

Human saliva and olive oil have been found to be detrimental to sperm function. Certain commonly used commercial lubricants, although labeled as non-spermicidal or spermicidal agent-free, have been found to impair sperm function, with several of these lubricants being as toxic to sperm &quot;in vitro&quot; as contraceptive gels. Sperm motility and viability were found to be disrupted shortly after direct contact between sperm and those lubricants or in saliva. Sperm function could be compromised following lubricant contact, due to the specific ingredients in the lubricant or due to the chemical properties of the lubricant, such as highly raised osmolarity or low pH. Such lubricants are therefore unsafe for use during fertility procedures such as semen collection or by couples trying to conceive by natural or assisted reproduction.

Vaginal lubricants such as mineral oil, canola oil, or hydroxyethylcellulose-based lubricants are recommended for use by couples attempting conception by The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

====Anal-specific====
Many lubricants are safe for anal sex, but there are products that are specifically marketed or designed to enhance enjoyment of anal sex. Often, this is simply a thicker gel rather than a liquid. This thicker consistency is preferable because it helps the lubricant stay in place. Some anal lubricants contain numbing agents to relieve discomfort during anal sex, although it is generally inadvisable as a lack of sensation makes accidental injury more likely. Additionally, a commonly used numbing agent benzocaine can cause an allergic reaction in those with an allergy to PABA (4-aminobenzoic acid). Some lubricants are conveniently packaged for ease of application. Many of these products such as Astroglide Shooters have been pulled from the market due to FDA Medical Device Requirements. Products containing benzocaine can numb all body parts with which they come in contact.

===Organic or natural===
In the United States, the first certified organic personal lubricant labeled with the USDA organic seal was Nude Personal Lubricant, which was created in 2004 by Applied Organics. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates lubricant as a medical device rather than as a cosmetic. Because of strict FDA guidelines for medical devices, organic personal lubricants were no longer allowed to carry a USDA seal, and they should be very careful about using the term &quot;organic&quot; anywhere on the label. Many of these types of lubricants also market themselves as &quot;natural&quot; and do not contain parabens, glycerin, diethanolamine (DEA) or animal-based ingredients. Some contain botanicals such as aloe vera or plant extracts.

===Specialty lubricants===
Warming lubricants contain specific ingredients to cause a sensation of warmth. Breathing on these types of lubricants may increase the effect. &quot;Cooling&quot; or &quot;tingling&quot; lubricants may contain ingredients such as peppermint. Some lubricants are sold together, such as &quot;hot and cold&quot;, or are marketed for a specific use or effect. Flavored lubricants contain flavorings, such as fruit flavors, to enhance oral contact. &quot;Edible&quot; lubricants may be flavored and/or may not contain any ingredients that are not advisable to eat.

===Other===
Other products that have been used as personal lubricants include vegetable shortening, which is durable and inexpensive but damaging to latex. In a controversial scene in the movie &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;, the character Paul, played by Marlon Brando, uses butter during anal sex with the character Jeanne, played by Maria Schneider.

==Uses==
===Sexual activity===
A personal lubricant can be used to increase pleasure and reduce pain during sexual intercourse or other activities and may be used for lubricating the penis, vagina, anus, stroker, dildo or other sex toys before or during activity. Lubricant may be applied to any body part desired, to the inside and/or outside of condoms, or to the hands or fingers. Personal lubricants are particularly useful for intercourse when a partner experiences dryness or excessive contraction (tightness) of the vagina or anus. Anal sex generally requires more generous application of lubricant since the anus does not have natural lubrication sufficient for most sexual activity.

====Masturbation====
While most males and females produce varying amounts of their own lubrication, extra lubrication is sometimes sought when needed. There are specific lubricants which may be used in male masturbation, often called &quot;masturbation creams&quot;, but are not suitable for vaginal or anal use or for use with condoms. Many men in Japan use lubricant created specifically for onaholes such as the Tenga Egg. Lubricant that is safe for sexual intercourse is also safe for masturbation.

Hand lotion is often used for recreational masturbation and popularly seen as an alternative to lubricants created specifically for sexual intercourse.

===Medicine===
Enema nozzles and rectal thermometer tips should be lubricated before use to minimize friction while inserting through the tightly retentive anal sphincter.

Personal lubricants can help treat erectile dysfunction in older men.

==Risks==
As of December 2012, the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration does not typically require testing of personal lubricants in humans. The agency classifies them as medical devices, so testing occurs on animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Rectal use of lubricants is viewed by the agency as an off-label application. In 2012 it was reported that participants who consistently used personal lubricants for rectal intercourse had a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI), such as chlamydia, than inconsistent users. Some warming lubricants have been shown to have an osmolality count more than 30 times the body&#x27;s own fluid. Increased herpes transmission was more than ninefold when compared with animals not administered lubricant. In 2007 it was demonstrated that certain lubricants can cause significant damage to the rectal tissue of human study participants – major shedding of cells from tissue samples biopsied 60 to 90 minutes after lubricant application was observed. Certain lubricants containing the ingredient chlorhexidine, an antibacterial agent, has been shown to kill three species of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and has been shown to unbalance the natural flora in the vagina, which might lead to infections such as bacterial vaginosis. Lubricants with osmolalities closer to that of the body, such as agar-based lubes, did not damage the tissue samples or boost HIV infection rates.

Some may experience irritation from the use of certain lubricants. Some lubricants (as mentioned above under Water-based) have been found to damage cells or even increase the replication of the HIV virus. Nonoxynol-9, a spermicide contained in some lubricants, can destroy vaginal and rectum cell membranes which may increase the rate of STI transmission. Spermicidally lubricated condoms do not contain enough spermicide to increase contraceptive effectiveness, but application of separate spermicide is thought to reduce pregnancy rates significantly.

<text>The U Sports Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship, is a Canadian university ice hockey tournament conducted by U Sports, and determines the men&#x27;s national champion. The tournament involves the champions from each of Canada&#x27;s four regional sports conferences. The David Johnston University Cup is awarded to the winners. 

The UNB Reds are the current champions for the 2023–24 season. The Alberta Golden Bears hold the record of 16 championship wins, as well as the record of 24 championship final appearances. The Toronto Varsity Blues hold the record of 5 consecutive championship trophy wins, from 1969 through 1973, but have not returned to the tournament since 1993, when they suffered the second most lopsided loss in a UCup final, 12–1. Alternatively, during their power years, winning 9 UCups in the 1960s and 1970s, the Blues were the victors in the overall most lopsided final, winning 16–2 in 1967. In the seven years from 2013 through 2019, only the Alberta Golden Bears (3 wins) or the UNB Reds (4 wins) won the championship. The currently dominant UNB Reds have won four of the last six UCups.

==History==
The trophy was presented to U Sports, then known as the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU), for presentation to a national champion starting with the 1962–63 season, by Queen&#x27;s University and the Royal Military College of Canada. These two schools, located in Kingston, Ontario, had been the participants in the first organized interuniversity hockey game, played in Kingston in 1885. The cup is meant to recognize the overall contribution made to the game of hockey by outstanding university players.

The CIAU changed its name to Canadian Interuniversity Sport (renaming the trophy the CIS University Cup) in 2001, and again in October 2016 to U Sports (renaming the trophy the U Sports University Cup).

The original University Cup is located at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and does not travel publicly. A replica was created with a less ornate cup in 2006. Between 2006 and 2015, the trophy has been modified after several repairs - the metal bowl is now of simpler design, and mounts more flush to the main wooden portion. The two handles that used to be attached to the bowl, and frequently broke off, were removed. An additional black wooden ring was added to the bottom of the trophy in order to incorporate more school shields, as an engraved metal shield, with diagonal stripes in the winning school&#x27;s colours, is added to the trophy every year.

On March 13, 2018, U Sports renamed the cup the David Johnston University Cup in honour of David Johnston, former Governor General of Canada.

The 2020 championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic after two quarter-final games had already been played. On October 15, 2020, the 2021 inception was also cancelled.

With the completion of the 2023–24 championship, 27 different teams have played in the national championship final (however Sir George Williams University merged with Loyola College in 1974 to create Concordia University, so it could be described as 26 different teams). In all, 17 different teams have won the national championship.

The winningest coaches are Tom Watt and former UNB coach Gardiner MacDougall, whom, at the helm of the Toronto Varsity Blues and Reds respectively, won nine University Cup championships between 1966 and 1977 and 2007 and 2024. Clare Drake sits second, coaching the Alberta Golden Bears to six University Cup championships between 1964 and 1986.

==Format==
===1963–1971===
When the tournament was inaugurated in 1963, the only teams invited were conference champions. At the time, not every conference held a postseason tournament, nor was every conference champion invited. The only participating teams were the champions of the four leagues thought of to be playing senior college hockey. Not all teams were satisfied with this arrangement. The OIAA applies for its champion to receive an entry into the 1964 tournament but their application was denied. In protest, the conference immediately dissolved and forced the CIAU committee to reconsider over the summer. At the same time, Toronto, declined their invitation in 1964. The very next season, with the OIAA now included in the tournament field, all four teams that qualified for the QOAA tournament announced that they would not accept an invitation to the 1965 University Cup.

While these disagreements could have dealt a debilitating blow to the tournament, all parties were eventually able to come to an agreement by 1966. The champions of the five conferences would now be invited to participate with the conferences that reached the final the previous season automatically being placed in the semifinals. Unfortunately, this new arrangement meant that whichever team lost the quarterfinal round would only play a single game. Previously, thanks to the consolation match, all teams were guaranteed at least two matches. In order to address this minor wrinkle, a consolation bracket was introduced in 1967. For several years afterwards, teams that lost in either the quarterfinal or semifinal rounds would play one another to determine the final three places in the tournament. This format remained largely intact for the next several years until a large conference realignment took place in 1971.

===1971–1975===
The early 1970s saw three leagues in the middle of the country dissolve with all associated teams resorted into two provincial conferences for Ontario and Quebec. As a result, the tournament entrants were reduced back to four teams and allowed the University Cup to eliminate both the quarterfinal round and the consolation bracket in 1972. However, one year later, the WCIAU was split in two as a way to help the western teams cut down on operating costs. An arrangement was made with the two new conferences (Canada West and GPAC) to allow the champions of both leagues entry into the University Cup, however, rather than play individual league championships, the two would send their regular season champions to the tournament site to play a quarterfinal match during the same time that the other three conference were holding their respective playoffs. This de facto conference championship was only held between the two western leagues. Additionally, instead of bringing the consolation bracket back, both the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds were converted into best of three series, guaranteeing that all participating teams would play at least two games. This format was used only for three seasons with a slight modification in 1975; that season saw the championship round being a best-of-three for the 

===1976===
In 1976, the University Cup format was radically altered. First, the team that agreed to serve as host (Toronto) was given an automatic qualifier for the first time. Because this could result in one conference having six teams participate for the first time, the CIAU decided to invite two teams from each of the five conference. This resulted in the largest field that tournament had ever seen (as of 2024). The secondary teams were selected based upon their performance in the respective conference tournaments. The two finalists from four of the leagues would automatically qualify four the tournament while, for the host team, if they were to win their tournament the final bid would go to the runner-up otherwise it would go to their conference champion. The qualifying teams were then sorted into three separate groups: East, West and Host. The conference that served as host (OUAA) would have both of their qualifiers advanced to the semifinal round while the remaining eight teams were placed into regional semifinal brackets. Due to the expanded nature of the tournament, the regional rounds were held at the home venue of one of the qualifying teams.

One team from each region (East and West) would advance to the semifinal round, however, seeding was not determined ahead of time. Instead, the bracket was arranged so that the East and West champion would play one of the two host conference teams in a semifinal first round. The winners of the first round game would then advance to the second round of the semifinals and play the losing team of the opposite first round match. It was only the winners of the semifinal second round that would advance to the championship game. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this convoluted format survived for only one tournament.

===1977–1985===
While many of the advents of the 1976 tournament were discarded, one was retained; the tournament host would continue to receive an automatic berth until 1987. With the field now set at six teams, the format was changed to a round-robin style. The participants were sorted into two three-team groups. Within each group, the teams would play one another once and the team with the best record would advance to the final. Ties were allowed in pool play, however, in case there was a tie in the standings, the team with the better goal differential would be advanced. This format remained unchanged until 1984, when the round-robin was dropped in favor of a quarterfinal round.

For two tournaments in the mid-80s, the conference that served as host would have both of its qualifying teams advance to the semifinals (much as they had in 1976). However, instead of a regional bracket, the remaining league champions were placed into East and West quarterfinals. The quarterfinal rounds were best-of-three while the semifinals were two-game total goal series. 

===1986–1987===
The collapse of the GPAC in 1985 resulted in a reduction of senior conferences down to four. Because the tournament host was still being offered an automatic bid, this left the field at 5 entrants. Instead of using one of the previous formats, the University Cup was expanded to seven teams. The qualifying schools were selected by one of three ways: The Host (Alberta) was seeded first and received a bye into the semifinal round. The champions of the four leagues were then sorted two through five based upon their overall records and placed in the quarterfinals accordingly. The final two wild-card spots would then go to the runners-up from the AUAA and OUAA and arranged so that there would not be intra-conference matches in the quarterfinal round. The QUAA was the only conference not to receive a second bye due to the fact that the league had been pared down to just five schools at the time.

For the 1987 tournament, the format reverted to a round-robin arrangement. Still with four conference champions, the tournament offered one wild-card spot to the runner-up of the OUAA tournament. This was done primarily due to the fact that the OUAA was by far the largest conference. However, this format lasted just one season before the OUAA absorbed QUAA, leaving just three active senior collegiate leagues.

===1988–1997===
1988 began a new era for the tournament. Toronto agreed to serve as tournament host for ten years. This allowed the CIAU to eliminate the automatic qualifier for the host team as an incentive. The tournament field was reduced to four entrants: Atlantic, Ontario, Quebec and West. The Atlantic and West spots would go to the AUAA and Canada West champions respectively. The OUAA would receive both the Ontario and Quebec bids which would go to the two tournament finalists. This format remained in place for the entire time that Toronto served as host. In later years, the championship game was held at Maple Leaf Gardens.

=== 1998–2014 ===
Starting in 1998, the CIS changed the format of the University Cup tournament to a six-team/two-pool tournament that would be hosted by a CIS member institution/team rather than in Toronto at Varsity Arena. The host would automatically be included in the tournament leaving five spots for regional representatives. The three conference champions and OUA Queen&#x27;s Cup Runner-up would automatically be included with the fifth spot as a rotating &#x27;wild-card&#x27; team. The University of Saskatchewan Huskies won the bid to host the first three (3) tournaments: 1998, 1999 and 2000.

The wild-card selection was initially chosen based on a static rotation through each conference starting with the AUS in 1998 followed by the OUA and CW, repeating on a tri-year cycle. Due to the random nature of the host bidding process, some tournaments saw more local teams then expected when the host advanced as a conference champion. It was possible for CW or AUS hosts to have 3 teams from their conference or 4 teams in the case of an OUA host who was also a champion. To reduce the local bias, the rotation selection rule was changed prior to the 2009 season - the wild-card would now only come from a non-host conference while maintaining the rotation. In 2009 the OUA was the host conference (Lakehead University) and should have also been the original wild-card conference, instead the AUS provided the wild-card. This rule remained in effect until the format changed in 2015 to 8 teams.

=== 2015–present ===
Starting in 2015, the tournament expanded from six to eight teams and moved from a two-pool format to a single-elimination competition (quarter-finals, semifinals and gold-medal final plus a bronze-medal game).

The eight teams competing include the four regional conference champions: AUS, Canada West, OUA West and OUA East (where the three men&#x27;s hockey teams from the RSEQ compete). The remaining four teams are: the host, the Canada West runner-up, the AUS runner-up and the OUA 3rd-place finisher (bronze medalist). The &#x27;natural&#x27; conference champions are seeded 1–3; AUS, CW and OUA Queen&#x27;s Cup Champion (in ranked order). The OUA Queen&#x27;s Cup Finalist is always seed  4. The remaining teams are seeded 5–7, all based on the pre-tournament Top 10 Ranking Poll with the expectation that the host is likely 8th.

A joint bid from St. Francis Xavier University and Saint Mary&#x27;s University was selected to host the first two events using this format; 2015 (St. FX as the host) and 2016 (SMU as the host). U Sports evaluated those two events and continues to use this tournament format.

==Finals appearances==

These tables rank appearances in the final championship game.

===By team===

===By team&#x27;s province===

The only province missing from this list, Newfoundland and Labrador, has only one U Sports member, Memorial University of Newfoundland. Memorial dropped their varsity men&#x27;s hockey team after the 1981–82 season.

==Location==
===By city===

===By province===
British Columbia is the only province to have a team play in the championship final (UBC Thunderbirds were runners-up in the original 1963 competition, nothing else since then), but to never host the championships. The other province missing from this list, Newfoundland and Labrador, had not yet hosted yet when it withdrew from varsity men&#x27;s hockey after the 1981–82 season.

==Awards==
In addition to the University Cup, the Major W.J. &quot;Danny&quot; McLeod Award is presented following the conclusion of the tournament to the individual deemed Most Valuable Player.

Major McLeod was the overall athletic director at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC), was the coach of RMC&#x27;s ice hockey team, and simultaneously coached two Kingston teams in the Ontario Hockey Association – the Kingston Frontenacs (Junior B) and the Kingston Aces (Senior A). McLeod was instrumental in establishing the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU) in 1961, operating the CIAU from his office at RMC as the first CIAU Secretary-Treasurer. He helped create the national university ice hockey championship tournament, which was hosted by RMC for its first two years (1963 and 1964).

<doc id="574983" wikidata="Q171109" url="?curid=574983" title="Crystal City station (Washington Metro)">
<text>Crystal City station is an underground Washington Metro station in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia. The station opened on July 1, 1977, and serves the Blue Line and Yellow Line services, with a Metroway bus rapid transit stop on the surface.

==Station layout==

The station has two side platforms in a cylindrical vault, which runs east–west under plazas on the north side of 18th Street South between Jefferson Davis Highway and Crystal Drive. The fare mezzanine is located above the center of the platforms. The single station entrance is on the northwest corner of 18th Street South and South Bell Street, with a bank of escalators leading to an upper mezzanine.

Located outside the station vault, the upper mezzanine has direct entrances to the underground Crystal City Shops. An elevator on the northeast corner of 18th Street South and South Bell Street connects directly to the lower mezzanine; each platform has one elevator from the mezzanine. Bus stops, including a Metroway stop served by both northbound and southbound buses, are located on South Bell Street under the 251 18th Street South building.
==History==

The station opened on July 1, 1977, part of the initial segment of the Blue Line between National Airport and Stadium–Armory stations that opened that day.

Virginia Railway Express began service in June 1992, with its Crystal City station about northeast of the Metro entrance. Metroway bus rapid transit service began on August 24, 2014, with a stop on Bell Street adjacent to the Metro entrance.

===Second entrance===
An east entrance to the station was proposed in a 2002 WMATA study. Planning for the second entrance began in 2011. A 2014 study identified five possible locations for the new entrance, with locations on the northeast and northwest corners of 18th Street South and Crystal Drive preferred. In February 2019, the state committed to building the entrance as part of a package of transportation improvements for the construction of Amazon HQ2 in National Landing.

In May 2019, property developer JBG Smith sent an unsolicited proposal, proposing that Arlington County pay the company to act as design-build contractor for the entrance on company-owned property. The county and company signed a preliminary agreement in June 2020. Design of the second entrance reached 30% in March 2021.

In March 2022, plans were changed from an underground to a surface-level fare lobby to reduce costs. In July 2023, the Arlington County Board awarded a $117 million design-build contract for the entrance to a joint venture of JBG Smith and Clark Construction. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 12, 2024, one month after construction started. The new entrance is expected to open in 2027.

<text>The Lonesome Crowded West is the second studio album by American rock band Modest Mouse, released on November 18, 1997, by Up Records. The two towers pictured on the album&#x27;s cover are The Westin Seattle.

Described as having a &quot;white trash&quot; aesthetic, &quot;&quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot; received positive reviews from critics, and appeared on several lists of the best albums of the 1990s. The album was reissued by Isaac Brock&#x27;s Glacial Pace label in 2014, along with Modest Mouse&#x27;s 1996 debut &quot;This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About&quot;.

== Style ==
&quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot; has been noted for its stylistic diversity. Blake Butler of AllMusic assessed that the album alternates between &quot;dark and pounding thrashers&quot; and &quot;quiet, brooding [acoustic]&quot; tracks.

==Critical reception==

Blake Butler of AllMusic praised the album&#x27;s innovation and stylistic diversity, saying &quot;there&#x27;s something here for everyone&quot; and called the album &quot;indie rock at its very best.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot; at number 29 in their list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1990s, and the song &quot;Trailer Trash&quot; reached number 63 in their list of the 200 greatest songs of the decade. &quot;Spin&quot; ranked the album at number 59 in their list of the 100 greatest albums of 1985–2005, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included the album in their list The Indie Rock 25. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; has described &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot; as the band&#x27;s breakthrough recording. Sam Hockley-Smith, in a retrospective review for &quot;Stereogum&quot;, refers to &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot; as &quot;the album that made Modest Mouse a great band instead of just a good one&quot; and writes that the primary theme of disillusionment in Brock&#x27;s lyrics is &quot;not pretty, but it&#x27;s honest, and that honesty makes it beautiful, like Modest Mouse were desperately trying — and failing — to hold onto that last bit of naiveté.&quot; In 2024, Paste Magazine ranked &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot; number 300 on its list of the 300 Greatest Albums of All Time.

In June 2012, Pitchfork.tv released a forty-five-minute documentary on the album. The documentary included archival footage taken during live performances and original recording/mix sessions.

As of June 2000, according to Nielsen SoundScan, the album had sold over 60,000 copies in the United States.

==Track listing==
===Vinyl edition===
The double-vinyl edition released on Up Records includes an extra track; &quot;Baby Blue Sedan&quot;, and a slightly re-ordered track listing. Rather than having a gatefold cover to house both records, or putting both records in a single cover, the double-vinyl release was shipped in two different covers. The 2014 vinyl reissue on Glacial Pace contains the same track listing and two-cover configuration.

<doc id="574988" wikidata="Q1332195" url="?curid=574988" title="Ugly Kid Joe">
<text>Ugly Kid Joe is an American hard rock band from Isla Vista, California, formed in 1989. The band&#x27;s name spoofs the glam metal band Pretty Boy Floyd&#x27;s name.

To date, Ugly Kid Joe have released five full-length albums, two compilation albums and two EPs. Their best selling records are &quot;As Ugly as They Wanna Be&quot; (1991) and &quot;America&#x27;s Least Wanted&quot; (1992), which were both certified double platinum by the RIAA; the former is notable for being the first EP to go platinum. The band broke up in 1997, but announced a reunion in 2010 and subsequently recommenced activity.

== History ==
=== Early history (1989–1991) ===
Childhood friends Whitfield Crane and Klaus Eichstadt took an interest in music while growing up in Palo Alto, California. In 1989 James Lambert and Eichstadt joined Crane&#x27;s band in Isla Vista, California, and the trio recorded a demo with another Palo Alto native, record producer Eric Valentine. After several band member changes, the band signed with Mercury Records in 1991. By this time the &quot;As Ugly as They Wanna Be&quot; line-up was formed; consisting of Crane, Eichstadt, Mark Davis, Roger Lahr, and Cordell Crockett.

Initially named Overdrive, then Suburban White Alcoholic Trash, the band got its name Ugly Kid Joe as a parody of L.A. glam band Pretty Boy Floyd, initially for a one night show in Santa Barbara opening for Pretty Boy Floyd. Pretty Boy Floyd would pull out of the show and have the gig cancelled, but the band decided to keep the name.

The band became popular in the early 1990s, mixing satirical humor and heavy metal. Its logo was a cartoon embodiment of an &quot;ugly kid&quot; wearing a backwards baseball hat and giving the finger. Heavily influenced by Black Sabbath, Ugly Kid Joe covered several of the veteran band&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; and &quot;N.I.B.&quot; The group toured the United States several times, making its second tour in support of Scatterbrain, and later opening for former Black Sabbath lead vocalist Ozzy Osbourne.

The band released the EP &quot;As Ugly as They Wanna Be&quot; in October 1991, garnering success in 1992 with the single &quot;Everything About You&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart and made it into the Billboard Top 10. Later in the year, the song would be used in the movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. &quot;As Ugly As They Wanna Be&quot; went on to sell over one million copies in the U.S. alone.

=== Commercial success (1992–1996) ===
The band spent two months in the studio to record &quot;America&#x27;s Least Wanted&quot;. During the process, Roger Lahr left the band due to musical differences and was eventually replaced by Sugartooth guitarist Dave Fortman in April 1992. Lahr is credited in the song &quot;Come Tomorrow&quot; and is included in the album&#x27;s liner notes, as the band thanked him for spending his time with them. Rob Halford of Judas Priest was a guest vocalist on the song &quot;Goddamn Devil&quot;. The band sped up the recording process for their album in order to get a spot as a supporting act for Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;No More Tears&quot; tour. The band eventually landed a spot for the tour, only to have Crane fly back to L.A. several times to finish edits on the album. The album caused controversy with its cover, which features the band&#x27;s mascot posing as the Statue of Liberty holding up the middle finger and holding a porno magazine in his hand instead of the Declaration. As some stores would not carry the album due to the cover image, the band decided to have an alternative cover made using the album&#x27;s back photo, which featured the band&#x27;s mascot chained and gagged.

&quot;America&#x27;s Least Wanted&quot; appeared on the U.S. charts at No. 27 having sold over 600,000 units upon release and was considered a favorite among fans and critics. One critic praised the album as, &quot;A rock record you can play all day.&quot; The album achieved Gold status in both Canada and Australia, Silver status in the United Kingdom, and went Platinum in the U.S. A cover of Harry Chapin&#x27;s &quot;Cat&#x27;s in the Cradle&quot; was subsequently released as a well-received single that sold over 500,000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart.

After finishing up with Ozzy, they opened up for Def Leppard on the European leg of their tour which was sold-out in 6 weeks. Ugly Kid Joe then made a stop at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards and thereafter spent 3 weeks playing sold-out shows in Australia and Japan. They became the Reader&#x27;s Choice for Best New Artist voted by &quot;Metal Edge&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot; magazine. They also presented The Favorite Heavy Metal band award to Metallica at the American Music Awards in 1993. The band would also get nominated for Favorite Heavy Metal/Hard Rock New Artist but lost to Pearl Jam.

After their tour in support of their 1992 album &quot;America&#x27;s Least Wanted&quot;, the band searched for a replacement drummer, as Mark Davis left to pursue a life away from the spotlight. The band tried out several new drummers, for example Bob Fernandez, who only recorded once, on a cover of Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;N.I.B.&quot; for the &quot;Nativity in Black&quot; Black Sabbath tribute album. He also performed in Brazil with the band at the Hollywood Rock festival in 1994 as headliners along with Aerosmith, Poison, among others. After attending a Souls at Zero show in Colorado, Crane became immediately impressed with the band&#x27;s drummer, Shannon Larkin. Crane later called up Larkin to join Ugly Kid Joe to which Larkin agreed. The band then wrote some new song material with Larkin and embarked on a short tour titled the &quot;Excuse To Go Snowboarding Tour&quot; with guests Dog Eat Dog and Goldfinger. Larkin&#x27;s contributions led to a grittier sound for the second album &quot;Menace to Sobriety&quot;, released in the summer of 1995. The album was recorded in Palacio Del Rio in northern Santa Barbara.

The band embarked on a tour in support of the album. They did a snowboard tour, a small club tour, and later a stadium tour opening for Bon Jovi and Van Halen. The band excluded &quot;Everything About You&quot; from their set list in order to show the fans that they stand tall on their recent material. At a show in Wembley Stadium in London, the band was joined on stage by Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s son, Jack Osbourne before playing Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;N.I.B&quot;.

&quot;Menace to Sobriety&quot; received much praise from the press and fans, and UK rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it as a contender for album of the year. Despite success overseas and a successful European tour, the album was given little encouragement from Mercury Records and subsequently failed in the United States.

After being dropped by Mercury, Ugly Kid Joe formed its own independent label, Evilution Records, for the release of the band&#x27;s next album. With distribution support from Castle Communications, &quot;Motel California&quot; was released in late 1996, and again the band toured Europe to smaller crowds. The tour was named &quot;Late Check-out Tour&quot;, underlining the band&#x27;s characteristic sense of humor. &quot;Motel California&quot;, an album lead vocalist Whitfield Crane described as &quot;heavy, funky, and has everything in it&quot;, initially received lukewarm reviews and sold poorly, though it has gained a minor cult following in recent times.

=== Break-up and aftermath (1997–2009) ===
Ugly Kid Joe disbanded in 1997. Drummer Shannon Larkin has been a member of Godsmack since 2002, while lead vocalist Whitfield Crane took the then-vacant vocalist spot for New York City rock band Life of Agony whose former singer Mina Caputo had left the group in 1997. After his quick departure from Life of Agony, Crane collaborated with some Soulfly members on a new project called Medication (1999–2003) and Godsmack members on Another Animal (2006–2009).

In 2005, an unreleased video for &quot;Bicycle Wheels&quot; was made public onto the Ugly Kid Joe forum site (created in January 2004 by J.Goldman, aka DMJ). In 2007, an official Myspace page was made of the band, with old photographs of the band and other candid pictures along with promotional artwork and uploaded live footage and another unreleased music video for &quot;Sandwich&quot;. Some of the other footage included footage of the band playing at the UC Santa Barbara campus before getting signed. Soon videos were appearing on YouTube by fans. Some even included live recordings of them in concert and television recordings. Meanwhile, the band&#x27;s main page featured live tracks and rare songs including a demo of &quot;C.U.S.T.&quot; and a few tracks from &quot;Motel California&quot; and &quot;Menace to Sobriety&quot;.

=== Reunion (2010–present) ===
Klaus Eichstadt stated in the December 2009 issue of the German edition of the music magazine &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, that the members of Ugly Kid Joe were planning to reunite in summer 2010, although did not specify whether their intent was to produce a new album or simply to perform together. However, rumors of a reunion were confirmed on their MySpace page on May 27, 2010. Their MySpace page also says that the reunion lineup would be the same as the last one before their breakup.

In July 2011, according to drummer Shannon Larkin, a new album had been completed. He revealed the album&#x27;s status in an interview with California&#x27;s 107.7 The Bone at the Mayhem Festival, saying &quot;It&#x27;s a fun band – it&#x27;s funny, you listen to the songs and it makes you laugh. Just a good-time rock band, y&#x27;know?&quot;

On September 9, 2011, vocalist Whitfield Crane made an update on the band&#x27;s official Facebook page stating he appeared 107.7 The Bone the day before and played a new track called &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t True&quot; and stating that a 6 track EP and was mixed and finished. According to official website &quot;also in the works is an EPK documenting the reunification and the latest recording sessions along with some rare old footage of interviews, behind the scenes stuff, and live performances&quot;.

The new EP, &quot;Stairway to Hell&quot;, was released digitally on June 5, 2012, while a physical version surfaced a month later, July 9. In order to promote the recording, Ugly Kid Joe played a series of festivals that summer, including Sweden Rock in Sweden, Download in England, Gods of Metal in Milan, Italy, and Belgrade Calling in Serbia. They were the main support act for Guns N&#x27; Roses in Tel Aviv, Israel on July 3, 2012, and also for Alice Cooper on his &quot;Raise The Dead&quot; tour in October 2012.

Ugly Kid Joe started a joint co-headlining European tour with Skid Row in October 2013 kicking off the tour in Southampton, UK.

In February 2015, Ugly Kid Joe successfully used pledgemusic.com in a crowdfunding effort to pay for the recording of their next album, to be titled &quot;Uglier Than They Used ta Be&quot;, is the first full-length studio album since they break-up after the album was completed in nearly 19 years, set to be released on October 16, 2015.

Ugly Kid Joe&#x27;s first studio album in seven years, &quot;Rad Wings of Destiny&quot;, was released on October 21, 2022.

In January of 2023, the band announced its first U.S. tour in 27 years. The tour includes Fozzy and Pistols at Dawn.

== Musical style ==
Ugly Kid Joe has been categorized under several genres, including hard rock, pop metal, heavy metal, alternative metal, funk metal, and grunge. AllMusic described them as a &quot;fun-loving hard rock/funk/alt-metal group&quot; that has a &quot;knack for crafting infectious pop-metal&quot;.

<text>The Harvard Lampoon is an undergraduate humor publication founded in 1876 by seven undergraduates at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Overview==
The &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; publication was founded in 1876 by seven undergraduates at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who were inspired by popular magazines like &quot;Punch&quot; (1841) and &quot;Puck&quot; (1871). &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot; is the world&#x27;s third longest-running continually published humor magazine, after the Swedish &quot;Blandaren&quot; (1863) and the Swiss &quot;Nebelspalter&quot; (1875).

The organization also produces occasional humor books (the best known being the 1969 J. R. R. Tolkien parody &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;) and parodies of national magazines such as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Much of the organization&#x27;s capital is provided by the licensing of the &quot;Lampoon&quot; name to &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, begun by &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; graduates in 1970.

The &quot;Lampoon&quot; publishes five issues annually. In 2006, the &quot;Lampoon&quot; began regularly releasing content on its website, including pieces from the magazine and web-only content. In 2009, the &quot;Lampoon&quot; published a parody of &quot;Twilight&quot; called &quot;Nightlight&quot;, which is a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. In February 2012, the &quot;Lampoon&quot; released a parody of &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; called &quot;The Hunger Pains&quot;, also a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

The &quot;Lampoon&quot; is housed a few blocks from Harvard Square in a mock-Flemish castle, the Harvard Lampoon Building. It has been ranked by the magazine &quot;Complex&quot; as the fifth most phallic building in the world.

==History==

The &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; was first published in 1876 by seven founders including Ralph Wormeley Curtis, Edward Sandford Martin, Edmund March Wheelwright, and Arthur Murray Sherwood (father of Robert E. Sherwood). The first issue of the &quot;Lampoon&quot; was a single copy, nailed to a tree in Harvard Yard. In its earliest years the magazine focused primarily on the satirization of Harvard and Boston Brahmin society. As the &quot;Lampoon&quot; began to gain notoriety on campus, the society moved from offices in Hollis Hall to addresses on Holyoke and Plympton streets respectively. These collections of rooms rented by the trustees of the &quot;Lampoon&quot; were famous not only for their beer nights, but also with the regularity that the &quot;Lampoon&quot; spent the profits made on each magazine for these beer nights. &quot;It was a good night when the Lampoon could afford coal and beer, and they often had to choose between one or the other.&quot; Pranks abounded in the early years, some more destructive than others. William Randolph Hearst was expelled from Harvard after sending a pudding pot used as a chamber pot to a professor.

A &quot;Lampoon&quot; graduate from 1887, Archibald Cary Coolidge, professor of architecture at Harvard College, was chosen as the architect of Randolph Hall, one of the college&#x27;s newest dormitories. Legend has it that when designing Randolph, Coolidge purposefully made the dormitory recessed further back from Mt. Auburn Street than was at first designed, purchasing for himself the land the Castle now stands on. The commission to design the castle was given to Edmund M. Wheelwright, then city architect of Boston.

The &quot;Lampoon&quot; and its sensibility began to branch out away from the Harvard campus in the early 1960s, and soon became an important expression of, and feeder system for, American humor and comedy. In 1961, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; offered the &quot;Lampoon&quot; staff an honorarium to produce a parody of their own magazine for the traditionally lower-selling July issue. The project boosted &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;&#x27;s summer circulation along with the &quot;Lampoon&quot;″s ever tenuous cash flow, and the magazine renewed its association with the &quot;Lampoon&quot; for a follow-up parody in July 1962, and a third parody issue (of &quot;Esquire&quot;) in July 1963. The magazine also produced a 70-page spoof of Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;James Bond&quot; novels in 1962 titled &quot;Alligator,&quot; which was subsequently released by Random House. These projects proved popular, and led to full, nationally-distributed parodies of &quot;Playboy&quot; (1966), &quot;Time&quot; (1968), and &quot;Life&quot; (1969), and later, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in 1972, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; (1974), and &quot;People&quot; (1981).

An important line of demarcation came when &quot;Lampoon&quot; editors and &quot;National Lampoon&quot; co-founders Douglas Kenney and Henry Beard wrote the Tolkien parody &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;. The success of this book and the attention it brought its authors led directly to the creation of the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine. This in turn spun off a live show &quot;Lemmings&quot;, and then a radio show in the early 1970s, &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot;, which featured such performers as Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Chevy Chase.

Writers from these shows were subsequently hired to help create &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; This was the first in a line of many TV shows that &quot;Lampoon&quot; graduates went on to write for, including &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The League&quot;, &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; and dozens of others. An old copy of the magazine was shown in the fourth-season finale of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;, and referred to as the &quot;nefarious scandal sheet.&quot;

Lampoon alumni include such comedians as Conan O&#x27;Brien, Andy Borowitz, B. J. Novak, Greg Daniels, Michael Schur, Christopher Cerf (Sesame Street), and Colin Jost. Etan Cohen wrote for &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; as an undergraduate member. In 1986 former editor Kurt Andersen co-founded the satirical magazine &quot;Spy&quot;, which employed &quot;Lampoon&quot; writers Paul Simms and Eric Kaplan, and published the work of &quot;Lampoon&quot; alumni Patricia Marx, Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell, Suchetas Bokil, and Mark O&#x27;Donnell. The &quot;Lampoon&quot; has also graduated many noted authors such as Robert Benchley, John Berendt, Walter Isaacson, George Plimpton, John Reed, George Santayana, John Updike, and William Gaddis. Actor Fred Gwynne was a cartoonist and president of the &quot;Lampoon&quot;. Famous Boston lawyer Bradley Palmer acted as treasurer for the &quot;Lampoon&quot;.

Celebrities often visit the &quot;Lampoon&quot; to be inducted as honorary members of the organization. Honorary members include Aerosmith, Winston Churchill, John Cleese, Bill Cosby, Billy Crystal, Tony Hawk, Hugh Hefner, Kesha, Jay Leno, Elon Musk, Ezra Pound, Adam Sandler, the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Sarah Silverman, Tracey Ullman, Kurt Vonnegut, John Wayne and Robin Williams.

==Rivalry with &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;==
The &quot;Lampoon&quot; has a long-standing rivalry with Harvard&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;, which repeatedly refers to the &quot;Lampoon&quot; in its pages as &quot;a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine&quot;. The two organizations occupy buildings within less than one block of each other. Interaction between their staff has included pranks, vandalism, and romance.

The &quot;Lampoon&quot;–&quot;Crimson&quot; rivalry was furthered by the &quot;Crimson&quot;″s 1953 theft of the Lampoon Castle&#x27;s ibis statue and presentation of it as a gift to the government of the Soviet Union.

On 27 September 2011, the &quot;Lampoon&quot; stole the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; President&#x27;s Chair, and had it used as a prop on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. 

On 2 June 2015, the &quot;Lampoon&quot; again stole the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; President&#x27;s Chair; this time, pretending that it was the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot;″s editorial staff, they took the chair to Trump Tower to fake an endorsement for later-president Donald Trump.

On 5 October 2024, the &quot;Lampoon&quot; impersonated the &quot;Crimson&quot;, distributing &quot;Trump for Truth&quot; T-shirts, and interviewing with Right Side Broadcasting, New York Post and Associated Press, faking a &quot;Crimson&quot; endorsement of Trump, at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, PA, at the same site where a gunman tried to assassinate Trump in July.&lt;ref name=&quot;hC/Trump-Penn-Lampoon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters/Trump-PA-2024-10-05&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="574992" wikidata="Q4769396" url="?curid=574992" title="Annie Oakley (TV series)">
<text>Annie Oakley is an American Western television series that fictionalizes the life of the famous Annie Oakley. (Except for depicting the protagonist as a phenomenal sharpshooter of the period, the program entirely ignores the facts of the historical Oakley&#x27;s life.) Featuring actress Gail Davis in the title role, the weekly program ran from January 1954 to February 1957 in syndication. A total of 81 black-and-white episodes were produced, with each installment running 25 minutes in length. ABC aired daytime reruns of the series on Saturdays and Sundays from 1959 to 1960 and then again from 1964 to 1965.

==Synopsis==
The series starred Gail Davis as Annie Oakley, with Brad Johnson as Deputy Sheriff Lofty Craig and Jimmy Hawkins as Annie&#x27;s little brother, Tagg Oakley; Hawkins appeared in 80 of the series&#x27; 81 episodes. In the pilot episode, &quot;Bull&#x27;s Eye&quot;, Tagg is played by Billy Gray (better known for his role as James &quot;Bud&quot; Anderson, Jr. on the TV version of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;). After playing Tagg in the &quot;Annie Oakley&quot; pilot, Gray joined the cast of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; (which premiered in October 1954, nine months after the initial broadcast of &quot;Annie Oakley&quot;).

In the series, Annie Oakley rides a horse named Target: Tagg&#x27;s horse is Pixie, and Lofty&#x27;s mount is Forest. Annie and Tagg live in the fictional town of Diablo, Arizona with their uncle, Sheriff Luke MacTavish, who is frequently away when trouble starts; it is then up to straight-shooting Annie and her &quot;silent suitor&quot;, Lofty Craig, to rescue law-abiding neighbors and arrest outlaws. Tagg is often told to stay in town and out of the way. When the need arises to relay important new information or capture by outlaws, he usually ends up in the middle of each episode&#x27;s adventure.

Annie usually wears the same fringed cowgirl outfit, of which 15 (or more) copies were made during the show&#x27;s production. She wears her hair in braided pigtails. Additional episodes were considered, but Hawkins had a growth spurt and outgrew his role as Annie&#x27;s little brother. &quot;Annie Oakley&quot; was one of Gene Autry&#x27;s Flying A Productions.

<text>The ecclesia or ekklesia () was the assembly of the citizens in city-states of ancient Greece. 

==The ekklesia of Athens==
The ekklesia of ancient Athens is particularly well-known. It was the popular assembly, open to all male citizens as soon as they qualified for citizenship. In 594 BC, Solon allowed all Athenian citizens to participate, regardless of class. The assembly was responsible for declaring war, military strategy and electing the strategoi and other officials. It was responsible for nominating and electing magistrates (árchontes), thus indirectly electing the members of the Areopagus. It had the final say on legislation and the right to call magistrates to account after their year of office. A typical meeting of the Assembly probably contained around 6,000 people, out of a total citizen population of 30,000–60,000. It would have been difficult, however, for non-wealthy people outside the urban center of Athens to attend until reimbursements for attendance were introduced in the 390s. It originally met once every month, but later met three or four times per month. The agenda for the ekklesia was established by the Boule, the popular council. Votes were taken by a show of hands, counting of stones and voting using broken pottery.

A police force of 300 Scythian slaves carried red ochre-stained ropes to induce the citizens who loitered in the agora of Athens to attend the meetings of the assembly. Anyone with red-stained clothes who was not in the meeting was liable to a penalty.

A quorum of 6,000 members was required sometimes to do business. The ecclesia elected the Boule annually by lot. Some of their power under Solon was delegated to the Court by Pericles in his reforms.

==Ekklesiasterion==
In ancient Greece, an ekklesiasterion was a building specifically built for the purpose of holding the supreme meetings of the ecclesia. Like many other cities, Athens did not have an ekklesiasterion. Instead, the regular meetings of the assembly were held on the Pnyx and two annual meetings took place in the Theater of Dionysus. Around 300 BC, the meetings of the ekklesia were moved to the theater. The meetings of the assembly could attract large audiences: 6,000 citizens might have attended in Athens during the fifth century BC.

<text>The U Sports Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship, branded as the Women&#x27;s Basketball Final 8, is a Canadian university basketball tournament conducted by U Sports, and determines the women&#x27;s national champion. The tournament involves the champions from each of Canada&#x27;s four regional sports conferences. The Bronze Baby trophy is awarded to the winners.

Seventeen different schools have won the tournament. The University of Victoria has the most tournament wins, with nine. Laurentian University has seven championships. The University of British Columbia has taken the title six times, while the University of Windsor and Simon Fraser University have five apiece. Carleton University, the University of Winnipeg, and University of Manitoba have each won three championships, while Bishop&#x27;s University and the University of Saskatchewan have won two. Seven programs have one national championship.

== History ==
The tournament was originally composed of just four qualifying teams from 1972 to 1976 until it was expanded to include six in 1977. The championship was then changed to include eight teams in 1979 and has generally remained the same since then. In the 2011 edition, the then-named CIS had West, Central, and East regional play-in games to determine the three remaining spot in the tournament (the other five went to the four conference champions and host). In 2012, there were East and West regional games to determine two additional berths and by 2013 the league had reverted to voting in the three remaining spots. Aside from those two years of regional qualifiers, the tournament has always taken place over one weekend at a pre-determined host site.

The trophy features a figure that is a replica of a statue that was in the grounds of Dunfermline College of Physical Education in Scotland. The trophy was first donated in 1922 by the Students&#x27; Council of McGill University and awarded to the Ontario and Quebec conference champion of the Women&#x27;s Interuniversity Athletic Union (WIAU). After the WIAU amalgamated with the Ontario Women&#x27;s Interuniversity Athletic Union (OWIAA) in 1971, the trophy was retired and returned to McGill. The trophy was then offered to the Canadian Women&#x27;s Interuniversity Athletic Union (CWIAU) in 1972 to be competed for at a fully national level. The CWIAU merged with the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union (CIAU), the men&#x27;s union, in 1978 and awarded by the now-named U Sports governing body.

The 2021 championship tournaments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Format==

The championship consists of an eight-team single-elimination tournament. Four teams automatically qualify for the tournament as one of the winners of the four conferences, two qualify as the runners-up of both the OUA and Canada West conference, one qualifies as the host, and one is given an at-large berth.

==Results==

==Title by school==

<text>The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) (1990–2005) was the Australian Government body through which Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders were formally involved in the processes of government affecting their lives, established under the Hawke government in 1990. A number of Indigenous programs and organisations fell under the overall umbrella of ATSIC.

The agency was dissolved in 2005 in the aftermath of litigation involving its chairperson, Geoff Clark. It was the longest running Indigenous affairs department to have existed.

==History==
ATSIC was established by the Hawke government through the &quot;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989&quot; (the ATSIC Act), which took effect on 5 March 1990. It superseded the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC), a statutory authority created by the Fraser government in July 1980. In 1990 Minister for Aboriginal Affairs Gerry Hand proposed merging the functions of the ADC into the newly created ATSIC, by establishing a new body, the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation (AEDC), which was created along with ATSIC. Both were formally established in March 1990, with ATSIC responsible for providing loans for small enterprise and larger loans and grants, while ATSIC Development Corporation (ATSICDC) was to invest only in major commercial projects.

While ATSIC&#x27;s existence was always subject to the oversight of governments who represent all Australians, ATSIC was a group of elected individuals whose main goal was the oversights that related to Indigenous Australians, who include the many Aboriginal peoples of Australia as well as Torres Strait Islander peoples, of the Torres Strait Islands (part of Queensland). However, in 1994 the Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) was established as a separate authority, in order to deliver better services and programs to Torres Strait Islander people who were living in the Torres Strait Islands (i.e. excluding those on the mainland).

==People==
The chairs of ATSIC were:
* Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue (1990–1996)
* Gatjil Djerrkura (1996–2000)
* Geoff Clark (2000–2004)
* Lionel Quartermaine (2003–2004)

Deputy chairs included Ray Robinson.

Mick Gooda succeeded Tom Calma to become ATSIC&#x27;s final Chief Executive Officer.

From 1982 until 1993, Vince Copley, as sports officer at ATSIC, ran a series of competitions and carnivals at which new talent could be identified, and also established an annual awards sports night for Aboriginal athletes, which ran for around a decade.

==Controversy and review==
In 2001, ATSIC became embroiled in controversy over litigation surrounding its chairperson Geoff Clark, relating to his alleged participation in several rapes in the 1970s and 1980s, after being named by four women.

Soon after this, the government under then Prime Minister John Howard began to remove some of ATSIC&#x27;s fiscal powers, which were transferred to a new independent organisation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services (ATSIS). The government suspended Geoff Clark as chair of ATSIC in 2003 after he was convicted of obstructing police during a pub brawl, and Lionel Quartermaine became acting chair.

A review of ATSIC was commissioned in 2003. The report, authored by John Hannaford, Jackie Huggins and Bob Collins, was titled &quot;In the Hands of the Regions: A New ATSIC Report of the Review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission&quot;, and it recommended reforms which gave greater control of ATSIC to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at a regional level. At the time, Indigenous Affairs Minister Amanda Vanstone stated that the review had concluded that ATSIC has not connected well with the indigenous Australians and was not serving them well.

==Abolition==
For some time after Clark&#x27;s appointment, the Howard government had been expressing doubts as to the value of continuing to have ATSIC at all. Following Mark Latham&#x27;s election to the leadership of the (Labor) Opposition in December 2003, Labor agreed with the government that ATSIC had not worked. In April of election year 2004, both parties pledged to introduce alternative arrangements for Indigenous affairs, with Labor proposing a new elected national body.

The government&#x27;s plan was to abolish ATSIC and all of its regional and state structures, and return funding for Indigenous programs to the relevant line departments. Labor&#x27;s view was that ATSIC itself should be abolished, but many of the regional and state sub-organisations should be retained, to continue to give Indigenous people a voice in their own affairs and within their own communities. It rejected the notion of merging Indigenous funding into funding for Australians generally as &quot;tried and failed&quot;, but had not announced its alternative proposals.

Howard announced the agency&#x27;s abolition on 15 April 2004, saying that &quot;the experiment in elected representation for Indigenous people has been a failure&quot;. On 28 May 2004 the government introduced into the Federal Parliament legislation to abolish ATSIC. The Bill finally passed both houses of Parliament in 2005, and ATSIC was formally abolished at midnight 16 March 2005.

==Successors==
===Ministerial Taskforce on Indigenous Affairs===
On 28 May 2004 the Ministerial Taskforce on Indigenous Affairs (MTF) was established for the purpose of &quot;driving the delivery of improved services and outcomes for Indigenous Australians&quot;. It was chaired by Mal Brough, Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs.

===Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination===

The Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination was created within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs on 1 July 2004 &quot;to coordinate and drive the Government&#x27;s new arrangements in Indigenous affairs&quot;, and took on ATSIC&#x27;s responsibilities upon its abolition. Following machinery of government changes, that office was transferred to the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs on 27 January 2006.

===National Indigenous Council===

On 6 November 2004 a government-appointed advisory body, the National Indigenous Council, was announced by the former Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, who said that the National Indigenous Council would &quot;provide expert advice to the Australian Government on policy, program and service-delivery issues affecting Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders&quot;. It would act as an advisory body only, to support the work of the Ministerial Taskforce on Indigenous Affairs.

==Inquiry and other commentary==
At the time the government announced its dismantling, Bob Collins, who had served in the Hawke ministry when ATSIC was established, said that the organisation had let down Indigenous people by deciding that &quot;looking after Geoff Clark was more important than looking after ATSIC&quot;.

Following an Inquiry, the 2005 report by its Select Committee said that while there had been widespread support for instituting changes to the way that ATSIC was structured as well as how it operates, there was also &quot;overwhelming&quot; support for the continued existence of a national Indigenous representative body. Most witnesses had suggested that regional operations could be improved, but they were strongly in favour of having a national, elected Indigenous representative body. Deep concerns were expressed about the disempowerment of Indigenous peoples. One of the recommendations was that the government &quot;give active support and funding to the formation of a national Indigenous elected representative body, and provide it with ongoing funding&quot;.

The dismantling of ATSIC was seen by many commentators as harmful to Aboriginal people in Australia. In 2009, Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue expressed her opinion that reform of the agency would have been better than establishing a new agency which has been costly and might suffer similar problems as its predecessor, such as nepotism.

ATSIC was criticised by a government advisory panel in 2009 for having been dominated by males.

<doc id="575008" wikidata="Q2954229" url="?curid=575008" title="U Sports women's ice hockey">
<text>U Sports women&#x27;s ice hockey is the highest level of play of women&#x27;s ice hockey at the university level under the auspices of U Sports, Canada&#x27;s governing body for university sports. Women&#x27;s ice hockey has been played in U Sports since the 1997-98 season, when the governing body was known as the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union, following a long stint of teams only competing in the OUA. There are 35 teams, all of which are based in Canada, that are divided into four conferences that are eligible to compete for the year-end championship. As these players compete at the university level, they are obligated to follow the rule of standard eligibility of five years.

== History ==

The 1890s marked the beginning of the first women&#x27;s ice hockey teams in Canadian universities. These universities included the University of Toronto in Toronto, Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, and McGill University in Montreal. In 1908, other schools such as the Calgary Collegiate Institute and Mount Royal University began to ice competitive teams as well. In the early years, teams played behind closed doors and men were not authorized to attend the matches. The referee was the only man present during the matches.
Starting in 1900, male spectators were authorized to assist in women&#x27;s matches in most of the Canadian provinces and some university teams. During this time, there was no university women&#x27;s league and some university women&#x27;s teams competed against rivals representing cities. Sometimes, they were forced to cross big geographical distances by train in order to participate in tournaments

The first provincial women&#x27;s championship took place in 1914 in Picton, Ontario. Six teams participated in the event, including the University of Toronto. In 1921, the University of Toronto bested McGill University during the first Canadian women&#x27;s university championship. The Toronto Lady Blues would gain 11 championship titles, compared with two titles for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Gaels before the women&#x27;s university league dissolved in 1933 During this time period, Elizabeth Graham, a Queen&#x27;s University goaltender, carried a fencing mask during matches in 1927. She would be the first goaltender in ice hockey, before the famous Jacques Plante, to carry a protective face mask.

On December 16, 1922, the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association (LOHA) was formed, and included several Ontario university teams In 1923, the Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WIAU) is created with the aim of offering sporting events to students in Ontario. The WIAU coordinated the programs of the students, and several university women&#x27;s teams were members there. In the autumn of 1923, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association held its annual meeting in Port Arthur, Ontario. It was here that the association decided not to give to the women official recognition as hockey players. From 1931 until 1941, the non-university team Preston Rivulettes were unbeaten in the LOHA and won ten consecutive championships. Numerous university women&#x27;s teams are reluctant to join the LOHA because they estimated that they would be unable to compete against the Rivulettes. Due to the Great Depression, several university women&#x27;s teams were dissolved. Consequently, ice hockey teams became rarer for numerous women&#x27;s teams.

In 1941, the LOHA was dissolved and, in the aftermath, several teams begin to disappear. The Second World War also affected the level of participation in women&#x27;s ice hockey in Canada. From 1936 to 1948, and from 1951 to 1960, there was no WIAU official women&#x27;s competition. Women’s ice hockey would not return until the 1960s at the Canadian university level.
The revival in the 1960s resulted in the creation of new women&#x27;s teams in several Canadian universities. In 1969, the Canada West Universities Athletic Association, with a mission to organize championships in multiple sports for women university students in Western Canada, presented a proposal which eventually led to the creation of the Canadian Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CWIAU). The first recognized national women&#x27;s championship was in volleyball, presented in March, 1970 at the University of Waterloo. While the CWIAU had been created, university women&#x27;s ice hockey was still not prevalent outside Ontario, where the Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WIAU) merged with the Ontario-Quebec University Athletic Association (OQUAA) to form the Ontario Women&#x27;s Interuniversity Athletic Association (OWIAA) in 1971. This resulted in university women&#x27;s teams multiplying and several American university tournaments inviting Canadian teams. Regional women&#x27;s university ice hockey championships began to grow elsewhere in Canada, and in March 1998, the first Canadian national university championship in women’s ice hockey took place. The Concordia Stingers, in Montreal, hosted the event and won the first U Sports championship.

== Schedule structure ==
In the U Sports regular season, 36 teams play between 20 and 28 matches in their respective regional conferences. At the end of the season, qualifying rounds (in each regional conference) determine the champion team in each of the four Canadian regions. Afterwards, a national tournament takes place consisting of eight teams: the winning team in each of the four regional championship conferences; (Atlantic University Sport, Quebec Student Sports Federation (in French, &quot;Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec&quot;), Ontario University Athletics and Canada West Universities Athletic Association). In addition, the organizing team of the national tournament (the university which hosts the annual event) and the defending champion, as well as the finalist from all four conferences qualify.

== Participating universities ==
As of the 2023–24 season, the Canadian university women&#x27;s ice hockey competition consisted of four conferences and 35 teams. In recent history, the Lethbridge Pronghorns dropped their program following the 2019-20 season. The Bishop&#x27;s Gaiters program joined the RSEQ conference in 2020–21 while the Trinity Western Spartans and MacEwan Griffins programs became members of the Canada West conference that same year. However, following the cancellation of the 2020–21 season, the Laurentian Voyageurs discontinued their women&#x27;s ice hockey program in 2021.

== National Champions ==
The U Sports women&#x27;s ice hockey championship is awarded annually to Canada&#x27;s women&#x27;s ice hockey champions at the university level. The championship has been competed for since 1998, when the sport was established in the league. Previously, the most important Canadian university women&#x27;s ice hockey championship was the one from the Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WIAU) (from 1921 till 1971), along with that of the Ontario Women&#x27;s Interuniversity Athletic Association (OWIAA) (from 1972 till 1997) which awarded the Dr. Judy McCaw trophy to the team champion.

The governing body was known as the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union (CIAU) when women&#x27;s hockey was added to its championship roster. The body&#x27;s name changed to Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) in 2001 and the current U Sports in 2016.

<text>Armstrong Circle Theatre is an American anthology drama television series which ran from June 6, 1950, to June 25, 1957, on NBC, and from October 2, 1957, to August 28, 1963, on CBS. It alternated weekly with &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;. It finished in the Nielsen ratings at number 19 for the 1950–51 season and number 24 for 1951–52. The principal sponsor was Armstrong World Industries.

Between July 8 and September 16, 1959, CBS aired reruns of six documentary dramas originally broadcast during the 1958–1959 season as episodes of &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot; under the title Armstrong by Request. &quot;Armstrong by Request&quot; aired during &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;′s time slot and also alternated with &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, ABC-TV aired three standalone A.C.T. specials that were adaptations of Broadway musicals — &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1966), and &quot;Kismet&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot; (both 1967).

==Synopsis==
The program&#x27;s first season featured episodes that tried &quot;to please every body in a mass audience, using only highly formularized plays. The next season brought a different approach, with more emphasis on characters than on plot. Edward B. Roberts worked with writers from all over the United States to find scripts. By mid-November 1952, he estimated that he had talked to 3,000 writers and looked at 20,000 scripts. Authors received $750 for each accepted script.

The series featured original dramas by noted writers, although sometimes comedies were shown. Its guidelines specifically called for the avoidance of violence. Originally a half-hour production, in 1955 the show expanded to an hour and began to emphasize dramatized versions of real-life contemporary events (including the sinking of the SS &quot;Andrea Doria&quot;) and a documentary on the history of Communism in the Soviet Union. Upon moving to CBS, the show emphasized several Cold War topics, including espionage, Radio Free Europe and escapes from East Germany.

David Susskind, producer of the program, called the new episodes &quot;actuals&quot;, describing them as &quot;dramatizations based on truth&quot;.

==International broadcast and streaming==
The series didn&#x27;t air internationally until June 4, 2007 when Telecapri News aired the first 10 seasons of the show and on Telecapri with the 11th, 12th and 13th season until December 29, 2016 and with repeats both on Telecapri Sport until January 17, 2018 and on the same network until April 12, 2024, all with Italian subtitles in Italy. It is also known as &quot;Teatro di Armstrong&quot;. 

The success of the Italian broadcast on Telecapri News in the late 2000s and 2010s (followed by Telecapri from 2015 to 2016) led the series to broadcast in Poland, where Polsat JimJam aired only the sixth and ninth season with Polish subtitles and in the United Kingdom on CBS Justice. 

It is unknown whether this show will be available to stream on Paramount+.

Currently, the rights to this show are owned by Paramount Global.

<doc id="575015" wikidata="Q7714341" url="?curid=575015" title="The Arsenio Hall Show">
<text>The Arsenio Hall Show is an American syndicated late-night talk show created by and starring comedian Arsenio Hall.

There have been two different incarnations of &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;. The original series premiered on January 3, 1989, and ran until May 27, 1994. Nineteen years after the original series ended, Hall returned for a revival. It premiered on September 9, 2013, and was cancelled after one season, with the finale airing on May 21, 2014.

Both series were produced by Hall&#x27;s production company, Arsenio Hall Communications. The original series was produced and distributed by Paramount Domestic Television and taped at Stage 29 at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles. The second series was shot at Sunset Bronson Studios in Hollywood, and it was produced by Tribune Broadcasting, Octagon Entertainment and Eye Productions. It was distributed by CBS Television Distribution.

==First series (1989–1994)==
===Background===
Hall had been a host on &quot;The Late Show&quot; in 1987, another talk show on Fox, after the dismissal of Joan Rivers. He was given a 13-week run, during which he became unexpectedly popular. During the monologue of his final appearance as host, Hall stated that he agreed to only do 13 weeks because he could only stay long as he had plans &quot;to do other things&quot;. He subsequently began working on the Eddie Murphy vehicle &quot;Coming to America&quot;. He ultimately signed with Paramount Television before Fox finally decided, after the fact, that it wanted to keep him. Hall had a fairly long connection with Paramount before this, having been the in-house comedian on Paramount&#x27;s weekly music series &quot;Solid Gold&quot; for several years and co-hosting its final two years.

&quot;Arsenio&quot;, debuting on Tuesday, Jan. 3, 1989, with guests Brooke Shields, Leslie Nielsen and Luther Vandross, was one of two late-night shows to premiere that month. The other was &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot; on CBS, hosted by longtime &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; host Pat Sajak. Unlike Sajak, Hall benefited from prior experience hosting a late-night program, especially when compared with Sajak&#x27;s lack of emceeing experience outside of his &quot;Wheel&quot; duties. Hall also had a clear demographic to serve (whereas Sajak was targeting the already-taken demographic that was watching &quot;Johnny Carson&quot;), and his show premiered the week before Sajak&#x27;s, giving him a head start. While Hall&#x27;s show became a near-instant hit, Sajak&#x27;s show was a ratings flop and was canceled after little more than a year.

===Recurring features and gags===
Burton Richardson&#x27;s long intro of the show&#x27;s host (in which he held the letter &quot;O&quot; in &quot;Arsenio&quot; for as long as ten seconds just before Hall came out on stage, and then in the same breath, immediately announced &quot;HALL!&quot;) is a staple of the show. In the intro to the final episode, Richardson held his one-breath introduction for exactly twenty seconds, one of the few times he had done so. While being introduced (and as seen on show titles and promos), Arsenio stood with his head down, hands together and legs apart, in the shape of the letter &quot;A&quot;.

One of the show&#x27;s recurrent themes was affixing a humorous label to a section of the studio audience in rows behind/near the band, called the &quot;Dog Pound&quot;, based on the Dawg Pound fan section of Cleveland Stadium and later FirstEnergy Stadium of the Cleveland Browns National Football League team. Members of the original band called &quot;the Posse&quot; included John B. Williams, Starr Parodi, Peter Maunu, Terri Lyne Carrington (later replaced by Chuck Morris) who were led by jazz pianist Michael Wolff, jubilantly interacted with Hall, standing up and making a pumping, whirling motion with their raised fists and howling &quot;Woof, woof, woof&quot;. The labeling was a staple of Hall&#x27;s opening monologue and almost always began with the phrase &quot;Those are people who...&quot; In one variation of Hall ridiculing the &quot;Dog Pound&quot;, Hall designated the section as &quot;People who are currently in a Witness Protection Program&quot;, at which point a camera pans over to that section to reveal a digitally pixelized view of the audience that made it impossible to identify them.

A frequent joke in Hall&#x27;s opening monologue suggested that he still lives in Cleveland and drives to Los Angeles every day to host the show. While on these alleged long drives, Hall ponders certain thoughts, referring to them as &quot;things that make you go hmmm...&quot; The running gag inspired a 1991 C+C Music Factory song by the same title. &quot;Things That Make You Go Hmmm...&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart and No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

===Cultural influence===
&quot;The Arsenio Hall Show,&quot; which premiered on 135 stations nationwide, was aimed primarily at, although not limited to, the younger urban audience. Eddie Murphy (a personal friend of Hall&#x27;s), George Lopez and other performers were often featured, such as semi-regular guests including Andrew Dice Clay and Paula Abdul. The show quickly appealed to young people of all races and began to attract a wide variety of guests not common on other talk shows. It became the show for entertainers to go to in order to reach the &quot;MTV Generation&quot;. The show was commonly dubbed a &quot;Night Thing&quot; and reflected a party or nightclub theme.

Hall&#x27;s friend M.C. Hammer was also a frequent interview and musical guest. Additionally, Hall interviewed &quot;Jason Voorhees&quot;, the main character from the popular &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; series of films around the time of the release of &quot;Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan&quot;. Muppets creator Jim Henson also appeared on the show 12 days before his death in May 1990, marking one of Henson&#x27;s last public appearances. Hall often featured World Wrestling Federation wrestlers, like Hulk Hogan (who first denied using steroids on the program), &quot;Ravishing&quot; Rick Rude (who made a special set of tights with Hall&#x27;s face on the back) with Bobby Heenan, Randy Savage, Roddy Piper, Bad News Brown, the Big Bossman, and Akeem with Slick and The Ultimate Warrior.

Hall was also well known for his long fingers, which he would often use to point at the audience. Michael Wolff led the house band, which Hall called &quot;Posse&quot;.

===Queer Nation incident===
During a December 1990 taping, three or four members of Queer Nation, seated in the back row in different sections of the audience, interrupted Hall&#x27;s opening monologue demanding to know why he never had any gay guests on the show. Hall&#x27;s initial answer was that since most of the guests were not open about their sexuality, neither Hall nor the producers knew whether they were gay or not.

When the protesters voiced their offense because the show failed to book filmmaker Gus Van Sant (whose &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; was in production at the time) or actor Harvey Fierstein, Hall defended the show by saying that Elton John had been a guest. Increasingly infuriated, Hall added that he booked guests due to his interest in what they were working on at the time, not because of their sexual preference. (Specifically, in the case of Fierstein, saying that if he was doing something that Hall found interesting, he would book him as a guest.) The heated exchange went on for several minutes, and Hall continued to defend himself as both a comedian and a host, pointing out that he also had gay friends, and that a person&#x27;s sexual preference was really nobody else&#x27;s business. Fierstein eventually did become a guest on the show months later.

===Bill Clinton===
In June 1992, then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton (who was a fan of the show) was a guest on the show, playing &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; on the saxophone (causing Arsenio to quip, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to see a Democrat blow something besides the election&quot;). The appearance is often considered an important moment in Clinton&#x27;s political career, helping build his popularity among minority and young voters. Clinton went on to win the election in November 1992.

===Ratings decline and cancellation===
The program remained popular into 1993, airing on 178 stations throughout America. As the year went on, Hall and Paramount began having ratings problems due in large part to the premiere of three late-night series before the year was out.

At the end of the 1992–93 season one of Hall&#x27;s strongest bases consisted of CBS affiliates. At the time, CBS did not offer much in the way of late night programming other than its nightly crime drama rerun block and its overnight newscast &quot;CBS News Nightwatch&quot; (later replaced by &quot;Up to the Minute&quot;) and had not offered a late-night variety program since &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot; was cancelled in 1990. Among the reported 44 CBS stations that aired &quot;Arsenio&quot; at the time were WJW-TV, then the network&#x27;s affiliate in Hall&#x27;s hometown of Cleveland; WJBK-TV in Detroit (which, like WJW, is now a Fox affiliate); WUSA in Washington, D.C.; WAGA-TV in Atlanta (also now a Fox affiliate) and WBBM-TV in Chicago, one of the network&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations. Some of these stations picked up Hall&#x27;s show to fill the void left by Sajak&#x27;s cancellation, while many others had chosen to carry Hall&#x27;s program in lieu of Sajak&#x27;s. Another prominent group of stations that carried the program were affiliates of the still-young Fox, many of which picked up &quot;Arsenio&quot; to fill the gaps left when &quot;The Late Show&quot;, which never was able to find an audience, was finally canceled in 1988. This group, numbering 72 stations total, included WTXF-TV in Philadelphia, a station that Paramount acquired in 1991.

In the summer of 1993, David Letterman, who had spent over 13 years at NBC and the previous 11 as the host of the popular post-&quot;Tonight Show&quot; program &quot;Late Night&quot;, left the network due to his dissatisfaction with being passed over as host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; after the retirement of Johnny Carson in favor of Jay Leno the previous year. Letterman signed with CBS to do a late-night program which would compete head-to-head with &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and which would also compete with Hall&#x27;s program. Unlike the situation that prevailed when he was competing against Sajak, Hall was now up against one of the most popular hosts in late night television. Several CBS stations, including WBBM-TV, dropped Hall&#x27;s show when &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; debuted in August or pushed it back further in the night. Most of the rest dropped Hall when Letterman&#x27;s show became a runaway hit. WUSA was one of the exceptions, having rebuffed an edict by CBS for all of its affiliates to clear the &quot;Late Show&quot; at the normal network time for their respective time zones, while in Milwaukee, &quot;Arsenio&quot; was paired by Fox affiliate WCGV-TV with the &quot;Late Show&quot; back-to-back, which was refused clearance by then-CBS affiliate WITI (now a Fox O&amp;O) for syndicated sitcoms. Then-CBS affiliate WBAL-TV in Baltimore also retained the show when &quot;The Late Show&quot; started (being cleared by WNUV). &quot;Arsenio&quot; also found itself losing some of its audience to cable, as MTV launched the daily thirty-minute program &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;, which became popular in its own right.

Subsequently, Fox decided to get back into the late-night television battle after several years, despite &quot;Arsenio&quot; drawing solid ratings on many of its affiliates. In September 1993, the network premiered &quot;The Chevy Chase Show&quot; running directly against Hall, Leno and Letterman. Fox demanded that all of its affiliates air Chase&#x27;s show, leading the Fox stations airing &quot;Arsenio&quot; to either drop the series or relocate it to a less desirable time slot. Although &quot;The Chevy Chase Show&quot; was a critical and ratings flop and left the air after only five weeks, the stations that &quot;Arsenio&quot; had been or was still airing on were not immediately inclined to move it back, which caused more of a dip in the ratings.

On February 7, 1994, Hall announced that he would be featuring controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. He had also booked gospel singer Kirk Franklin and his singing group The Family for the show as well and promised that he would give them both equal time on the show, which was to air eighteen days following the announcement, as he had drawn criticism for even considering booking Farrakhan as a guest. Instead, nearly the entire show was devoted to Hall interviewing Farrakhan and he received widespread criticism for conducting what was considered too &quot;soft&quot; of an interview. This resulted in a further ratings slide during the fifth season, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; citing a 24% drop from 1992–93 to 1993–94.

Although Paramount did say publicly that the show was not in imminent danger of cancellation, Hall announced on April 18, 1994, that he was not going to continue the show, simply saying &quot;it&#x27;s time&quot;. The final episode aired on May 27, 1994.

===Aftermath===
Shortly before &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; was canceled, Paramount&#x27;s merger with Viacom was finalized. Since this now meant that Paramount and MTV were corporate siblings, there was a ready-made replacement for &quot;Arsenio&quot; and after a retooling and expansion, a syndicated version of &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; was launched in late 1994. Despite being sold to most of the same &quot;Arsenio&quot; affiliates, &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; was never able to find an audience in syndication as it had on MTV and the show was canceled after its lone season as a syndicated series.

After the decline of &quot;Arsenio&quot; and the failure of &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;, Paramount did not make another attempt at producing a late-night variety show. Nonetheless, they were not willing to give up on the idea fully and in 1998, Paramount developed a daytime variety show for comedian Howie Mandel. &quot;The Howie Mandel Show&quot; premiered in May 1998, but could not find an audience in what was then a syndicated landscape saturated with talk shows, and Paramount canceled the show in early 1999. Paramount subsequently gave up on the variety format altogether and did not attempt it again before its television operations were folded into those of CBS.

In the 2000s, VH1 aired a repacked version of the show called &quot;Arsenio Jams&quot; featuring musical performances and select interviews from the show&#x27;s first run.

==Second series (2013–2014)==
In May 2012, Hall was said to be shopping around an idea for a new late-night program and had garnered interest from Fox and TBS as to picking the show up. On June 18, 2012, Hall announced that he had brokered a deal with CBS Television Distribution and Tribune Broadcasting to bring his late-night talk show back to television. Although the show was agreed upon in time for the 2012–13 season, the agreement was to see &quot;Arsenio&quot; return at the beginning of the next season.

The revived &quot;Arsenio Hall Show&quot; debuted on September 9, 2013. Stations that also carried Hall&#x27;s original program, such as CBS-owned station KBCW in the San Francisco Bay Area and CFMT-DT in Toronto, picked up the revived series as well. Tribune-owned stations airing &quot;Arsenio&quot; included: KTLA in Los Angeles, KDAF in Dallas-Fort Worth, WPIX in New York City, WGN-TV in Chicago, KCPQ in Seattle and WDCW in Washington, D.C. The show also aired on CBS-owned stations affiliated with either CBS or The CW.

Unlike Hall&#x27;s previous series, this version was taped at the Sunset Bronson Studios in Hollywood, whose lot houses KTLA. As with the original series, Hall referred to his house band as &quot;The Posse 2.0&quot; which consisted of Robin DiMaggio as the music leader/director and drummer, Alex Al on bass, Rob Bacon on guitar, Sean Holt on saxophone and Victoria Theodore on keyboards. Additionally, Hall&#x27;s opening monologue still mostly consisted of jokes about current events. Hall ended each show by saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll see you in 23 (71 on each Friday show) hours.&quot;

In another notable difference from Hall&#x27;s previous show, Diana Steele&#x27;s intro to the show&#x27;s host (in which she held the &quot;O&quot; in &quot;Arsenio&quot; for a long as five seconds right before Hall came out onto the stage, and then in the same breath, finally/immediately announced, &quot;HALL!&quot;) was also a staple of the show.

In mid-October 2013, executive producer Neal Kendeall stepped down due to creative differences. The senior VP of programming and development, Eric Pankowski, took over while Hall conducted a search for a new show-runner, in an effort to revamp the show and boost ratings. Reruns were aired during the brief transition period until new episodes resumed the week of October 28.

During an interview with Oprah Winfrey that same month, Hall and Winfrey discussed a &quot;feud&quot; between the two based on jokes he told nearly 20 years earlier about her weight and Oprah&#x27;s partner, Stedman Graham. During their talk on &quot;Oprah&#x27;s Next Chapter&quot;, Hall also mentioned his long-time friendship with Jay Leno, how David Letterman was an influence on him and the late-night talk show competition in general, including the 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict between Leno and Conan O&#x27;Brien.

===Ratings and reception===
The debut episode beat out all late night shows in viewership that evening. However, after its premiere week in September 2013, the show&#x27;s record-setting ratings dropped 40% (falling from an average 1.5 rating to 0.4 with 18–49 target audiences). While ratings spiraled downward, show executives were optimistic.

Critical reactions to the updated show were mixed since its premiere week. According to &quot;Media Life Magazine&quot;, Hall&#x27;s flashy, edgy and laid-back approach to late-night talk shows in the early 1990s was having little effect on audiences after its reincarnation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the show had much familiarity and that &quot;Mr. Hall&#x27;s return to the screen was mostly a little sad. He is better than this and deserved a more convincing comeback.&quot; While also reporting Hall&#x27;s talk show is similar to his original series, &quot;Variety&quot; gave a better review/reception of the revived show, stating &quot;while he might not be the hippest guy in late-night anymore, Arsenio 2.0 can still emerge as a survivor&quot;.

In 2013, the Orange County Register described the original run of show as &quot;energenic, groundbreaking&quot;, and a &quot;cultural phenomenon, noting Hall&#x27;s confident personality, diverse guests and musical acts, and the parodies that have been inspired by the show since it first aired.

===Cancellation===
The revived &quot;Arsenio&quot; program was initially renewed for a second season on February 26, 2014; the announcement was made to that night&#x27;s audience on air by Jay Leno in his first post–&quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance. However, the decision was later reversed, and the program was cancelled by CBS Television Distribution and Tribune, on May 30, 2014.

==Spin-off==
In 1990, Hall decided to develop a companion program to his own as what he termed to be his show&#x27;s &quot;afterparty&quot;. This idea became &quot;The Party Machine&quot;, a 30-minute late night music show in the same vein as shows like &quot;Club MTV&quot; or &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Hall co-produced the series with its host, singer/actress Nia Peeples, and it debuted on January 7, 1991, in syndication (usually following its parent series). Although initial ratings were high, especially in its larger markets, &quot;The Party Machine&quot; began sliding in the ratings quickly and the program was cancelled five months after its debut. Its final episode aired on September 15, 1991.

<doc id="575025" wikidata="Q975277" url="?curid=575025" title="North (Something Corporate album)">
<text>North is the third and final studio album by American rock band Something Corporate. Near the beginning of the writing process for the album, vocalist and pianist Andrew McMahon and guitarist Josh Partington wanted it to &quot;sound like a winter album&quot;, in contrast to their second album &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; (2002) which they viewed as a &quot;summer album&quot;. After losing focus through constant touring, the group decided to record an album in Seattle, Washington. Recording took place at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle with producer Jim Wirt in May 2003. After relocating to Los Angeles, California, further tracking was done at 4th Street Recording in Santa Monica.

Following &quot;North&quot;″s announcement in July 2003, the band went on tour supporting 311 and Good Charlotte. Preceded by the single &quot;Space&quot; in September, the album was released on October 21 through Geffen and Drive-Thru Records. The band subsequently went on a headlining United States tour from October to December. In February 2004, guitarist William Tell left the band and was replaced by Bobby Anderson of the band River City High. Preceded by second single &quot;Ruthless&quot;, the group co-headlined a US tour with Yellowcard in March and April.

&quot;North&quot; received a positive response from music critics, several reviewers noted the band&#x27;s musical growth since their second album. The album charted number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, as well as number 154 in the United Kingdom. &quot;Space&quot; peaked at number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart. &quot;North&quot; sold 41,000 copies in the first week and would go on to sell 339,000 copies by June 2005. The album was released on vinyl for the first time in November 2013 to celebrate its tenth anniversary.

==Background and writing==
After finalizing their lineup, Something Corporate began performing at local venues, eventually gaining support slots for groups such as Better Than Ezra and Sugar Ray. Shortly afterwards, the band signed to independent label Drive-Thru Records. Drive-Thru had a distribution deal with major label MCA Records, which allowed the latter to upstream bands from the former. The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot;, released in early 2002, was a joint release between both record labels. While on tour, vocalist and pianist Andrew McMahon began writing material for their next album. Early in the writing process, McMahon and guitarist Josh Partington had discussions on what they wanted the album to sound like. They decided they wanted it to &quot;sound like a winter album&quot;, in contrast to &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; which they felt sounded like a &quot;summer album&quot;.

Partington elaborated: &quot;We really wanted it to feel, not sad and somber really but just kind of have a broody feeling.&quot; McMahon and Partington wrote songs separately. The pair wanted to showcase the different sides of the band and also display some form of growth from their preceding album. Partington had written six songs on the album before entering the studio. While touring Europe, the US went to war in Iraq. According to Partington, the group did not &quot;want to be playing a show when there&#x27;s something so much more important going on.&quot; As a result, the band cancelled the remainder of the tour, and returned to the US. Partington recalled that he and McMahon did &quot;a lot of writing&quot; together, and were &quot;really happy with the songs we had&quot; going into the studio.

==Recording and production==
The group would typically record an album in their home state of California. However, after constant touring, the band lost focus as Partington explained: &quot;When you&#x27;re away for a year touring straight, whenever you&#x27;re home, whether you&#x27;re working or not, your mind is like, &#x27;Yes, I&#x27;m at home. The group decided that to help them focus, they would record in Seattle, Washington. Partington said they wanted the album&#x27;s atmosphere to be a &quot;little bit darker&quot;, which he felt they would not be able to achieve if they were &quot;recording 45 miles away from home&quot;. On May 5, 2003, it was announced that the band was in the studio recording their next album at Robert Lang Studios and TMF with producer Jim Wirt. Wirt and Phil Kaffel acted as engineers, with Justin Armstrong as a secondary engineer with assistance from Geoff Ott.

Unlike with &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot;, which was recorded alongside friends, the members decided to immerse themselves in the recording process for &quot;North&quot;. Robert Lang Studios gave the band the opportunity to track in isolation, without any distractions from their hometown and the weather of California. Two days of the process consisted of Partington in the live room, tracking one-take run-throughs of each song on guitar. With this approach, Partington improvised a lot of the parts, which yielded &quot;lots of results.&quot; The band refrained from enhancing the recordings with studio effects, instead opting to showcase the songs through their musicianship.

On June 23, the band announced they were close to finishing recording. On the same day, the group worked on rough mixes of &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;21 and Invincible&quot; with Kaffel. The following Sunday, the band went to Los Angeles, California for a week to make sure &quot;everything [was] finished and that [they] didn&#x27;t forget anything.&quot; Further recording was done at 4th Street Recording in Santa Monica, California, with assistance from engineers Neil Couper, P.J. Smith and Jon Scholl. Smith also contributed additional background vocals. Kaffel and Wirt mixed the recordings at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, with assistance from engineer Neal Ferrazzani. Further mixing was performed at Skip Saylor Recording in Los Angeles, with assistance from engineer James Mugshorn. Vlado Meller mastered the recordings at Sony Mastering in New York.

==Composition==
&quot;As You Sleep&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Me and the Moon&quot;, &quot;Ruthless&quot;, &quot;She Paints Me Blue&quot;, &quot;Break Myself&quot;, &quot;21 and Invincible&quot;, &quot;Miss America&quot; and &quot;Watch the Sky&quot; were credited to McMahon. &quot;Space&quot;, &quot;Only Ashes&quot;, &quot;The Runaway&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Make You&quot; were credited to Partington. Paul Buckmaster arranged and played the cello, alongside Larry Corbett on &quot;Me and the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Runaway&quot;. The album&#x27;s sound had been described as pop punk and pop, compared to Ben Folds Five. &quot;Alternative Addiction&quot; wrote that the group mixed &quot;piano melodies with rocking guitars creating the &#x27;melodic punk&#x27; sound&quot; that was also on their second album. When talking about the album&#x27;s title, Partington said it was inspired by recording in Seattle, &quot;and also the fact that it was a growing process for everyone&quot;.

Discussing &quot;Space&quot;, Partington said there was nothing more infuriating than being with someone who loves you more than life &quot;but can&#x27;t necessarily even come close to grasping what you are all about at times.&quot; &quot;Only Ashes&quot; is about frustration and failure stemming from one&#x27;s own actions. The majority of &quot;Me and the Moon&quot; was written while McMahon was sharing a guest room with New Found Glory vocalist Jordan Pundik. The song talks about a woman killing her husband: the verses are about her doing the act of killing and the subsequently clean-up, while the choruses were set a trial scene. Though McMahon liked the melody and the piano parts, he felt choruses initially lacked a hook. While touring in the UK, he had taken mushrooms with friends; after breaking away from them he had decided to chase the Moon. He ended up in a locked bathroom with the words &quot;It&#x27;s me and the moon&quot; on a piece of paper.

The verses to &quot;Ruthless&quot; were originally a bit longer than the finished version until people told them that they dragged on. McMahon was fine with dropping some of the lyrics but Partington wanted to include them. McMahon said it was a break-up song about a person he worked with. He added that the point of the track was that he can &quot;still get my teeth out if I&#x27;m forced to, which I did.&quot; &quot;Break Myself&quot; is about complete desperation and being stuck in state where you&#x27;re unable to help anyone. &quot;21 and Invincible&quot; initially had different lyrics before they were changed for release. McMahon would later perform the song with its original lyrics intact. Discussing &quot;Watch the Sky&quot;, McMahon said he spent a night partying more than he usually did. After having a rough experience, he woke up and decided to sort himself out.

==Release and promotion==
In mid-2003, MCA Records was absorbed by Universal Music Group label Geffen Records, which resulted in MCA&#x27;s staff and roster being moved to Geffen. At the time, Partington said: &quot;[You] can&#x27;t worry about things that are out of your control ... I can&#x27;t do anything about it so you just keep doing what you&#x27;re doing.&quot; On July 12, 2003, &quot;North&quot; was announced for release. From mid-July to late August, the band supported 311 on their tour of the US. &quot;Space&quot; was released as a single on September 8, and released to modern rock radio a day later. A music video for the song was premiered by Fox Broadcasting Company on September 16 through their show &quot;The O.C.&quot; The video was filmed in August during the band&#x27;s tour with 311 by director Mike Piscitelli. It featured five pillars, all of them fitted with video monitors, placed in various locations within Los Angeles, such as in an alleyway or at a bus stop. In September and October, the band supported Good Charlotte on their US arena tour.

On October 14, 2003, the band appeared on &quot;IMX&quot;. &quot;North&quot; was released on October 21 through Geffen and Drive-Thru Records. Around the album&#x27;s release, the band was featured on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, as well as appearing on MTV2 programs &quot;New Faces of Rock&quot; and &quot;Advanced Warning&quot;. From late October to early December 2003, the band went on a headlining tour across the US with support from Rx Bandits, Mae, Days Away and the Format. The first date of the tour, which was planned to take place in San Diego, was postponed till mid-December due to California wildfires. Towards its conclusion, Rx Bandits dropped off, citing personal reasons, and were replaced by different acts for the remaining nights. Following this, the group toured across Japan and Europe in early 2004. On February 1, it was announced that guitarist William Tell had left the band to focus on his own music. Tell said that he had been writing music since he was younger, and put it on the backburner since joining the group. However, he &quot;knew that at some point I&#x27;d have to go back to that. It&#x27;s what makes me feel complete.&quot;

Bobby Anderson of River City High took over Tell&#x27;s position; the group had previously toured with River City High and looked up to Anderson. Partington called him &quot;a great player, [and] a really good singer.&quot; The group did a series of radio station appearances and played on college campuses throughout February and March. Following this, &quot;Ruthless&quot; was released to radio on March 15. The band headlined a few shows leading up to co-headlining performances with Yellowcard. Though this was initially for six shows, it was later expanded into a full tour running in March and April with support from Steriogram and the Format. To help promote it, the group offered a free live album, which recorded in November, to people that bought &quot;North&quot; at select retailers. Further US shows were played in May with the Rocket Summer and included a co-headlining spot with the Ataris at the RiverFusion festival. Following this, the band supported the Offspring on an Australian tour in June.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;North&quot; received a positive reception from critics. AllMusic reviewer Andrew Leahey wrote that McMahon traded &quot;shunning the drunk high school girls and classroom bullies&quot; on their second album for &quot;thoughtful ruminations on love, celebrity, and the steady approach of adulthood.&quot; Leahey noted that while the album contained &quot;some filler ... probably more&quot; than &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot;, &quot;North&quot; showed that the group had the &quot;maturity to move past the majority of their Warped Tour brethren.&quot; &quot;Alternative Addiction&quot; wrote that upon hearing the first chord, fans would &quot;immediately recognize&quot; McMahon&#x27;s growth as a songwriter. IGN writer Jesse Lord noted that while second albums often fall into a sophomore slump, &quot;North&quot; leaves fan with &quot;purely good music to enjoy.&quot; He mentioned that McMahon&#x27;s piano &quot;blends in with the band so much better&quot; compared to &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot;, coming across as &quot;feel[ing] natural, [and] not contrived.&quot; He also said that the album was &quot;mature&quot; and displayed &quot;signs that the band has aged; yet they are not pretentious about it, and are still in touch with their emotions.&quot;

Kaj Roth of &quot;Melodic&quot; wrote that, despite a year passing since the group&#x27;s previous album, it was &quot;enough to grow at least 10 years in life experience,&quot; noting that the album featured &quot;smart/intelligent&quot; Third Eye Blind-esque rock songs. Roth pondered if McMahon listened to Vanessa Carlton, since he pushed the songs &quot;one step further into an adorable trip of melodic euphoria.&quot; &quot;The Phoenix&quot; writer Sean Richardson wrote that with &quot;North&quot;, the band &quot;continue to prove themselves one of the most tuneful outfits in modern rock.&quot; Richardson noted that halfway into the album, when the songs&#x27; &quot;middling tempos start to bleed together,&quot; the group sounds &quot;as if they were striving for a level of maturity that’s not quite within reach.&quot; Punknews.org reviewer Adam White called it &quot;a more solemn and paced record,&quot; compared to their second album. White noted that it featured &quot;lots of contemplative ballads,&quot; all of which &quot;showcas[e] Andrew MacMahon&#x27;s characteristic piano and smooth vocals.&quot; Kristin Roth of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that album &quot;delves into an entirely different world&quot; with its lyrics &quot;explor[ing] a darker place, but just what that place is, it&#x27;s hard to say.&quot;

===Commercial performance and legacy===
&quot;North&quot; charted at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 41,000 copies in its first week of release. It also charted at number 152 in the UK. &quot;Space&quot; charted at number 37 on the Alternative Songs chart. By March 2004, the album had sold 222,000 copies. By March 2005, the album had sold 330,000 copies in the US, and by June, album sales stood at 339,000 copies. Looking back in 2010, Partington said the group were &quot;frustrated&quot; with the album&#x27;s lack of success: &quot;We had put in all this hard work and we were doing everything we could, but it felt like certain parts of the whole machine weren’t necessarily working in our favor.&quot; To celebrate the album&#x27;s 10th anniversary, it was released on vinyl for the first time in November 2013 through independent label Enjoy the Ride Records.

<text>Don&#x27;t Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers is the Firesign Theatre&#x27;s third comedy album, released by Columbia Records in July 1970. In 1983, &quot;The New Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; called it &quot;the greatest comedy album ever made&quot;. It was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1971 by the World Science Fiction Society. In 2005, the US Library of Congress added the album to the National Recording Registry and called the Firesign Theatre &quot;the Beatles of comedy.&quot;

#&quot;The Other Side&quot; – 24:12

==Detailed track information and commentary==
This was The Firesign Theatre&#x27;s first album wherein a single theme took up both sides of the album.

In Phil Austin&#x27;s notes to the 1987 Mobile Fidelity re-release of this album he says &quot;&quot;Dwarf&quot; is the story of the five ages of Man and in particular, the five ages of one George Leroy Tirebiter; a man named after a dog.&quot;

The piece centers on the character of Tirebiter (played by David Ossman), a former child actor who spends his time watching himself on late-night television.

As his evening unfolds, the listener hears &quot;excerpts&quot; from fictional movies in Tirebiter&#x27;s past. &quot;High School Madness&quot; stars &#x27;Dave Casman&#x27; as Peorgie Tirebiter and &#x27;Joe Bertman&#x27; as his sidekick, Mudhead—although an earlier portion of the recording intentionally blurs the distinction between fantasy and reality by identifying Tirebiter (not &#x27;Casman&#x27;) as having been the star of the &quot;Peorgie and Mudhead&quot; films, rather than a character in those films. &quot;High School Madness&quot; is a parody of the radio show &quot;The Aldrich Family&quot;, the &quot;Archie&quot; comic books, and 1940s and &#x27;50s American youth culture in general. In the movie, Peorgie and Mudhead investigate the theft of their high school, Morse Science High, by their rivals, Communist Martyrs High School, on graduation day.

&quot;Parallel Hell&quot; is a war film set in Korea, where the soldiers (including Tirebiter) debate the seemingly endless war. These are interspersed with commercials and other staples of late-night television (including televangelists and a talk show) as Tirebiter randomly changes channels. The broadcasts contain many references to warfare and Cold War paranoia (product names such as &quot;Napalmolive&quot;), indicating that Tirebiter&#x27;s world exists under martial law.

Another satirical comment from the album is the slogan of &quot;The Howl of the Wolf Movie&quot;: &quot;Presenting honest stories of working people as told by rich Hollywood stars&quot;. This is a reference to the 1968 Ingmar Bergman film, &quot;The Hour of the Wolf&quot;

It has been said that the album&#x27;s title was inspired by a photograph in Bob Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, where Dylan is holding a small picture of a person and a pair of pliers. It has also been said that the &quot;dwarf&quot; represents a burning &quot;roach&quot; (the final portion of a marijuana cigarette), to &quot;crush&quot; refers to stubbing out the &quot;roach&quot;, and &quot;the pliers&quot; refers to a &quot;roach-clip&quot;, a device for protecting the fingers while burning a &quot;roach&quot;. Some marijuana smokers from that era, pre-vapes, agree.

The credits on the back cover most likely include pseudonyms (e.g. &quot;Mr. Procmer,&quot; presumably a misspelling of Phil Proctor&#x27;s last name similar to the mention of &quot;Casman&quot; for Ossman and &quot;Bertman&quot; for Bergman on the album) but also include Anna-Lee Austin and Tiny Ossman, then the wives of Phil Austin and David Ossman. Anna-Lee Austin also is credited for the wake-up phone call and bird sound effects heard in the final dialogue segment.

==Continuity with other &quot;Firesign&quot; albums==
George Tirebiter&#x27;s failed pizza-to-go order is the other half of Nick Danger&#x27;s conversation from &quot;How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You&#x27;re Not Anywhere at All,&quot; and the album ends with George running outside to buy an ice cream cone from a passing ice cream truck, the chimes thereof opening the next album, &quot;I Think We&#x27;re All Bozos on This Bus&quot;.

==Origin of George Tirebiter&#x27;s name==
There was a real dog named George Tirebiter.

In 1946, a mongrel whose owner had died wandered onto the campus of the University of Southern California and was adopted by the students as an unofficial mascot. The dog acquired a reputation for chasing cars, hence the name. The dog became so famous that at one point he was kidnapped by rival students from UCLA, who shaved their school&#x27;s letters into his fur. He was run over and killed by a car in 1950.

In his notes to the Mobile Fidelity release, Austin says that the five ages of George Leroy Tirebiter are:
*Tirebiter the Child, called Peorge or Peorgie
*Tirebiter the College student, called George Tirebiter Camden N200-R
*Tirebiter the Soldier, called Lt. Tirebiter
*Tirebiter the Actor, called Dave Casman
*Tirebiter the Old Man, called George Leroy Tirebiter

==Reception==
In 1971, &quot;Dwarf&quot; was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

In 2005, &quot;Dwarf&quot; was added to the National Recording Registry, a list of sound recordings that &quot;are culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.&quot;

==Cover art==
The name &quot;Firesign Theatre&quot; was suggested by an astrologer-friend of the troupe who noted that all four members had been born under &quot;fire signs.&quot; The cover art, by Robert Grossman, features caricatures of the members as their respective astrological animals: Austin as a ram (Aries), Proctor as a lion (Leo), and Bergman and Ossman as two Satyrs or Centaurs (Sagittarius). The Sagittarians are armed, respectively, with a bow and suction-cup arrow and a squirt gun, and the other members are seated on their backs. An eponymous pair of pliers sits on the ground beneath them. The original LP release came with a poster, featuring Polaroid snapshots of group members.

<text>Athabasca University (AU) is a Canadian public university that primarily operates through online distance education. Founded in 1970, it is one of four comprehensive academic and research universities in Alberta, and was the first Canadian university to specialize in distance education.

==Origins==
Athabasca University was created by the Alberta government in 1970 as part of an expansion of higher education to cope with rising enrolment at the time. In the late 1960s, the University of Alberta (U of A) had long been established, the University of Calgary was created through new legislation, and an Order in Council had created the University of Lethbridge. In 1967, the Manning government announced its intention to establish a fourth public university, but this would be delayed by three years as the government considered different proposals. The U of A wanted to expand rather than see another university open in Edmonton to compete with it. One proposal favoured establishing a Christian university instead of a secular one. Another early suggestion was an &quot;Alberta academy&quot; that would take credits students had earned at multiple universities, evaluate them for transfer, and perhaps award degrees. A Department of Education ad hoc group favoured the establishment of a fourth public university.

A group of U of A graduates including Preston Manning influenced the development of an independent fourth university. In 1970, Grant MacEwan, then the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, established AU by an Order in Council. The name for the new university was a challenge, as it was not desired to associate the new university with a city (Edmonton) that already had a university (the U of A). Athabasca Hall, a student residence at the U of A, was scheduled for demolition, so the name was appropriated for the new Athabasca University.

In 1984, AU moved its main campus in Edmonton 145 kilometres (90 miles) north to Athabasca. The main campus remains in Athabasca, and there are satellite locations in Calgary, Edmonton and St. Albert.

In 1994, AU&#x27;s Centre for Innovative Management introduced the world&#x27;s first online MBA program.
The program had 65 students in its first year, and to date there have been almost 4,000 graduates from the online MBA program. Under the leadership of university president Dominique Abrioux (1995–2005), Athabasca expanded programs in all faculties, including graduate studies, with a new MA in Integrated Studies called MA-IS.

===Mandate===

The initial mandate for Athabasca University dictated that AU be primarily undergraduate in scope. Creating new procedures for curriculum development was also part of the mandate.

AU&#x27;s mandate was later revised to include graduate studies as well, and the university has offered graduate programs and courses since 1994.

===First president and early years===
In April 1971, Timothy C. Byrne was appointed the first president of Athabasca University, and he assumed office in June that year.

The initial governing authority of the university had eight members as well as a broad range of powers to set up the new university. On 2–3 July 1970, they met for the first time, and Carl W. Clement was the first chair. It was expected by the government of the day that AU would have 10,000 students by 1979. 1 September 1973, was set as the target date to open.

The AU administration chose the University of California, Santa Cruz, as its model, deciding that individual colleges should serve as the basic planning units for the new university, which would be organized as a federation of colleges. Each of the colleges was to have 650 students with corresponding lecture and office space. The learning approach would have students in small tutorials instead of large lectures. Research within the new university was to be limited to a specified region around the city of Edmonton. One criticism was that the university was trying to do too much.

The government of Peter Lougheed in 1971 brought changes including a cabinet portfolio specifically for post-secondary education. The newly elected Conservative government was opposed to building a new university in Edmonton, but architectural plans were permitted to continue. A proposal was made to the government to test the new model for three to five years, and if it succeeded, AU would become a fully independent university. This happened under chair Merrill Wolfe. The proposal was accepted by the government.

In the summer of 1972, the new deputy minister of Alberta Advanced Education stated there was a demand for lifelong continuing education. There was also a need for an &quot;Alberta academy&quot; that would evaluate university courses taken at multiple institutions and award degrees based on its evaluations. Meanwhile, AU also proposed to serve part-time students and made the case that this would not affect the traditional universities already established in Alberta or the new approach of AU. An open-door academic policy removing most traditional university admission requirements was part of AU&#x27;s proposal.

In 1972, a new Order in Council was issued to include only a new pilot project for distance education.

===Piloting distance education===

Trial and error characterized the pilot period, as there was no similar model to follow for the mandate Athabasca University was given. In 1973, AU began to advertise for students to help with course development. World Ecology was the first course and the core of the pilot project. In-house production of the learning packages for courses was important to the staff, so the university developed its own printing process.

In 1975, plans came together to reach out to students through field services tutors and regional learning resource centres. In 1976, the first part-time telephone tutors were appointed, 24 in total. The tutor role was to facilitate learning, not to teach the course. Tutors were assigned blocks of between 20 and 40 students each, and AU provided toll-free phone numbers that students used for contacting the tutors. All tutors were (and are still) required to have at least a master&#x27;s degree.

An early test project for a learning resource centre had books and tapes relevant to the courses available at branches of public libraries throughout Alberta. Although the libraries were keen on the idea, students preferred to remain in their homes to learn. By 1975, the median age was between 35 and 40, and there were 725 students. A minority of students had only completed Grade 9.

In 1975 at the end of the pilot project, an agency was appointed to evaluate its success. A recommendation was made to the Alberta government that the university be made a permanent member of the province&#x27;s university system. It was also to remain an open university. Under the chairmanship of Edward Checkland, the university gained permanency.

In 1976, Sam Smith took over as president, and the university&#x27;s permanency was established through an act of the Legislature of Alberta.

===Early collaborations===
The first collaboration the university embarked on was with Keyano College, which eventually led to the opening of a regional learning office in Fort McMurray, Alberta. (This regional office would later close.) In 1976, North Island College took on the challenge of delivering many of AU&#x27;s courses on its many campuses.

In 1985, AU reached an agreement with the Correctional Service of Canada for the payment of tuition and program delivery fees for federal inmates taking courses through the university.

=== Modern partnerships and collaborations ===
The university maintains more than 350 collaborative agreements with other Canadian and international educational institutions, with professional associations, with businesses, and with Indigenous institutions and communities.

Through Athabasca University&#x27;s partnerships with other post-secondary institutions, students have options. For example, they can add an Athabasca University course to their program at a partner institution, take classroom versions of Athabasca University courses at a partner institution or enrol in an Athabasca programs while studying at or working for a partner institution.

Through established transfer agreements, Athabasca University also recognizes previous education that obtained through colleges, technical institutes, or professional organizations. Block credit transfer arrangements have been established with numerous educational providers across Canada, granting program graduates a specified number of credits toward a particular degree.

A range of academic partnerships are in place, including a recent announcement in early 2019 with Lakeland College.

==== Amazon Web Services ====
Athabasca University is the first Canadian post-secondary institution to enter into a formal collaboration with Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS). This collaboration modernizes AU&#x27;s IT infrastructure and the two organizations will also be designing, implementing, and managing cloud education programs, artificial intelligence and machine learning initiatives, and research-based applications for the education sector. The partnership speaks to the five-year digital transformation of Athabasca University, as set out by the university&#x27;s strategic plans – &quot;Imagine: Transforming lives, transforming communities&quot; and &quot;RISE: Athabasca University&#x27;s Digital Transformation, Our 5 Year IT Strategy&quot;.

==== Canadian Football League Players&#x27; Association (CFLPA) ====
In June 2014, Athabasca University formally partnered with the CFLPA as the official education provider for their players – both past and present.

==== Western Hockey League (WHL) ====
Since 2009, the WHL and Athabasca University have partnered, offering fully accredited university courses to any WHL player interested in pursuing post-secondary studies while playing in the WHL. For the 2018/2019 hockey season, over 75 players have been taking courses through Athabasca University.

==== Professional Hockey Players&#x27; Association (PHPA) ====
Partnering with the PHPA, members of the association have access to online courses that they can complete through Athabasca University.

==== Blue Seal Program ====
The Achievement in Business Competencies Program, also known as the Blue Seal Program, gives Alberta-certified trade and occupational certificate holders the opportunity to earn a business credential that is recognized by employers. A Blue Seal illustrates they have the skills needed to succeed in business.

==Education delivery models==

The majority of Athabasca University&#x27;s courses are taught through online distance education, but some courses or components of courses are taught in-person, face to face. The major education delivery models at AU are as follows:

* Individual study: Students are provided with the textbooks, computer software, and video material required. A preset recommended schedule comes with each course. Each course has a professor, as with any university course. This person publishes a series of learning activities, readings and assessments. That publication becomes additional reading and activity for the student. Assignments are submitted to the professor via email or more commonly via the Moodle assignment drop box. The final exam is administered at Athabasca&#x27;s learning centres or a partner university, college or accredited individual. Students have up to six months to finish their course, unless they have received a student loan, in which case, they have up to four months. Courses start at the beginning of each month. Most courses are now augmented with additional resources and activities using the Moodle LMS
* Collaborative, online: Courses in the graduate programs are paced, usually beginning three times a year. The primary delivery platform is the Moodle Learning Management System, that is augmented by web conferencing using Adobe Connect and social networking using elgg-based Athabasca Landing
* Grouped study: Offered primarily to students physically in Alberta, this method allows students to get together with other students in the same course, and study in a manner similar to that of a regular university. Students studying in this method have up to four months to complete their course. Courses start in September and January.

===Centre for Distance Education===
In addition to delivering courses and programs primarily through online distance education, Athabasca University has a Centre for Distance Education (CDE). Since 2019, the CDE has existed in name only, and its staff and programs are now part of the Faculty of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences (FHSS). The former CDE, led by a core faculty and supported by additional sessional instructors, offered graduate-level courses and programs that taught other educators how to develop, design and deliver online education. The CDE was home to North America&#x27;s first online Doctor of Education in Distance Education, and it also offered a Master of Education in Distance Education and post-baccalaureate certificates and diplomas in distance education technology, instructional design, and technology-based learning. These programs and associated teaching methods continue to thrive in the FHSS.

===Distance education research===
AU also sponsors the publication of the &quot;International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning&quot;, which is listed in the Social Sciences Citation Index and is a well-known and frequently cited scholarly journal in the field of distance and open education.

==Accreditation==
Athabasca University reports to the government through the Minister of Advanced Education and is publicly funded through the Province of Alberta. The university&#x27;s governing council is authorized to grant degrees through the Post-Secondary Learning Act along with governing its own affairs. Members of the governing council are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in council.

Under the Post-Secondary Learning Act, Athabasca University is considered a &quot;Comprehensive Academic and Research University&quot; (CARUs). CARUs offer a range of academic and professional programs, which generally lead to undergraduate and graduate level credentials and have a strong research focus.

The university is accredited with the United States by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==Scholarships and bursaries==
The Government of Canada sponsors an Aboriginal Bursaries Search Tool that lists over 680 scholarships, bursaries, and other incentives offered by governments, universities, and industry to support Aboriginal post-secondary participation. Athabasca University bursaries for Aboriginal, First Nations and Métis students include: Alberta Historical Resources Foundation; Syncrude Canada Ltd./Athabasca University Aboriginal Scholarship; Frank and Agnes Cardinal Neheyiwak Bursary; Harold Cardinal Essay Prize for Aboriginal Students; Canative Scholarship for Métis Students; AU President&#x27;s Scholarship for a Blue Quills Student; First Peoples Technology Bursary In addition, people with disabilities and International students have access to these bursaries and scholarships.

==Notable people==
Some notable people have studied through Athabasca University, including Alberta politician Debby Carlson, Olympic bobsleigh racer Christian Farstad, former Alberta Premier Ralph Klein, professional hockey player Alyn McCauley, and cross-country skier Milaine Thériault. AU serves over 38,000 students (over 7,900 full-load equivalents) and offers over 900 courses in more than 50 undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of arts, science and professional disciplines.

==Controversy==

In 2012, it was revealed that Athabasca University was among institutions of higher education involved in illegal donations to the provincial Progressive Conservative party of Alberta. The university spent $10,675 on Conservative fundraising events, including golf tournaments and dinners. The university president retired early, and an interim president, Peter MacKinnon, was appointed by the university governing council.

=== Coates Report ===
Facing financial pressures in 2015, Athabasca University underwent an independent third-party review to report to ascertain long-term solutions. The report found that there was a significant student demand for flexible, online post-secondary options, but that Athabasca University needed a clear and shared vision for the future.

=== Looking forward ===
Looking to the future and guided by a new president, Neil Fassina, Athabasca University charted a renewed course. Building off recommendations from the Coates Report, &quot;Imagine: Transforming Lives, Transforming Communities&quot; was a strategic plan forward, built out of extensive collaboration with the entire Athabasca University community and acted as a roadmap with priorities to guide them on the path forward.

== &quot;Imagine: Transforming Lives, Transforming Communities&quot; ==
&quot;Imagine: Transforming Lives, Transforming Communities&quot; is a strategic plan that charted the path forward for Athabasca University crystallized the university&#x27;s mission and mandate. Important priorities were enacted, including a partnership with Amazon Web Services to transform and update its Information Technology infrastructure. A range of educational partnerships and collaborations also increased opportunities for learners to have barriers moved for access to university-level education, from Bow Valley College to Aspen View Public Schools and Northern Lakes College.

==Student representation==

===Undergraduate students===
Undergraduate students at Athabasca University are represented by the Athabasca University Students&#x27; Union. The AUSU head office is in AU Edmonton, though the students&#x27; council may have elected members from any area where AU students reside.

AUSU was officially incorporated as of 16 July 1992, and was formalized as a registered Alberta society until students&#x27; unions in Alberta were granted recognition under the Post-Secondary Learning Act. On 13 September 2004 the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta approved an order in council establishing &quot;The Students&#x27; Association of Athabasca University&quot;.

AUSU offers services to its members including but not limited to: an optional health &amp; dental plan student awards, a free subscription to LinkedIn Learning, student advocacy, and Athabasca University course evaluations. Student media at Athabasca University is provided by the official publication &quot;The Voice Magazine&quot;. Previously published on paper, the magazine since 2001 is published exclusively online in HTML and PDF format.

===Graduate students===
Visiting and program students at the graduate level are represented by the Athabasca University Graduate Students&#x27; Association. The organization was founded in 2010, and approved by the Alberta Advanced Education.

<doc id="575030" wikidata="Q3006006" url="?curid=575030" title="Crystal Pepsi">
<text>Crystal Pepsi is a cola soft drink made by PepsiCo. It was initially released in the United States and Canada from 1992 to 1994. It was briefly sold in the United Kingdom and Australia.

In 1991, PepsiCo&#x27;s risk-taking leadership ambitiously reshaped the company. It pushed consumer research to harness the clear craze and the New Age trend, and find a healthier recipe to stimulate the slowing cola market. After 1,000 product concepts and 3,000 formulations, it discovered a lighter flavor and appearance, with modified food starch instead of caramel color, and 20 fewer calories. It is a &quot;totally new product&quot; which resembles standard Pepsi but reportedly tastes less &quot;acidic&quot;.

Crystal Pepsi was launched in 1992 with a huge marketing campaign and to great success, capturing a 1% soft drink market share worth in its first year. PepsiCo made some mistakes, and Coca-Cola launched Tab Clear as a deliberate &quot;kamikaze&quot; copy to sabotage Crystal Pepsi, so it was off the market in 1994. Inspired by a grassroots campaign via telephone and the Internet, it was briefly re-released sporadically in the 2010s.

==History==

===Background===
The Coca-Cola Company had produced a clear cola in the past, produced as a secret one-off made as a particular political favor between General Dwight D. Eisenhower and top Soviet General Georgy Zhukov. Clear Coca-Cola, named White Coke, was produced to disguise the beverage as vodka.

The clear craze was a global marketing fad in the 1980s and 1990s, equating clarity with purity. The fad was inspired by the reintroduction of Ivory soap and its marketing slogan of &quot;99 and 44/100 percent pure&quot;. In 1990, a Canadian manufacturer released a colorless cola, called Canadian Spirit, which it tested in Boston, New York, Washington, Toronto, and Montreal. Soft drink sales boomed in the 1980s with popularization of diet drinks, but in 1991 slowed to a 1.8% growth rate.

Pepsi-Cola North America CEO Craig Weatherup was ambitiously internally restructuring the company while launching a multi-faceted development and marketing plan to expand as a &quot;total beverage company&quot;. This included the fast-growing and expandable New Age beverage market, with established competition from Clearly Canadian (reportedly having &quot;built a new market in two years&quot;), Nordic Mist, Snapple, and the waning Original New York Seltzer. PepsiCo was reportedly &quot;a lot more free-thinking and willing to make errors [... already having] made some very good errors&quot;.

===Development===
PepsiCo&#x27;s internal research already had &quot;1,000 different product concepts&quot;, but its consumer research demanded a healthier variety of cola, which was the number one soft-drink segment at 60% and yet slowing. Food technologists knew that food color strongly affects flavor perceptions, associating light flavors with light colors. Pepsi&#x27;s traditional caramel coloring, which adds body and flavor, was replaced with modified food starch for body with a clear look. PepsiCo devised 3,000 formulations of a new clear drink, under consumer testing. A serving of Crystal Pepsi has 134 calories compared to Pepsi&#x27;s 154 calories20 fewer. In November 1991, Pepsi-Cola publicly confirmed that it was working on a colorless version of Pepsi.

On April 13, 1992, Crystal Pepsi was launched in test markets of Dallas, Providence, Salt Lake City, and Colorado to a positive response. One month in test markets showed an unusually and unexpectedly strong launch due to product uniqueness and unprecedented consumer awareness. In Colorado, interviews of 100,000 customers further revealed demand for Diet Crystal Pepsi, which was launched there in October.

===Full launch===
Crystal Pepsi was launched nationwide in the US on December 14, 1992. In its first year, it captured one full percentage point of U.S. soft drink sales, or approximately (equivalent to $ in ). Coca-Cola followed by launching Tab Clear on December 14, 1992.

During the same year that Crystal Pepsi was released, several other manufacturers also released colorless versions of their existing products, such as colorless Palmolive dish soap, colorless Softsoap liquid soap, and colorless Rembrandt mouthwash. Even the Miller Brewing Company released a colorless beer, called Miller Clear, in Richmond, Minneapolis, and Austin the following year.

By late 1993, Crystal Pepsi was discontinued, and the final batches were delivered to retailers during the first few months of 1994. Several months later, Pepsi briefly released a reformulated citrus-cola hybrid called Crystal From Pepsi.

In 2005, Pepsi Clear was sold in Mexico for a limited time. On August 22, 2008, PepsiCo filed for trademarks on the product names &quot;Pepsi Clear&quot; and &quot;Diet Pepsi Clear&quot;. 

===Marketing===
Crystal Pepsi was marketed as a caffeine-free &quot;clear alternative&quot; to normal colas. Its official slogan was &quot;You&#x27;ve never seen a taste like this&quot;.

Gary Hemphill, public relations manager for Pepsico Inc, said &quot;The basic philosophy behind Crystal Pepsi is this: Crystal Pepsi is not Pepsi with the color stripped out. It&#x27;s a totally new product. It tastes differently than Pepsi [... which we married] to some of the attributes of the so-called New Age type products: lighter and less sweet tasting, clear, caffeine-free, all natural flavors, and no preservatives.&quot; A senior vice president relayed expectation of forging &quot;an entirely new category that really transcends New Age&quot;. Test marketing suggested that 80% of sales would come from non-Pepsi consumers. The goal was to capture 2% of the retail soft drink market by the end of 1993, or about , but without harming the flagship Pepsi product.

The marketing campaign included a teaser ad during the television coverage of the inauguration of the US President and of Super Bowl advertisements. The company invented the world&#x27;s first photo-realistic, computer-generated bus wrap printing. A series of television advertisements featuring Van Halen&#x27;s hit song &quot;Right Now&quot; premiered on national television on January 31, 1993, during Super Bowl XXVII. This advertisement was parodied by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as Crystal Gravy. Full-sized sample bottles were distributed with the Sunday paper deliveries such as the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; in Massachusetts.

According to Coca-Cola&#x27;s chief marketing officer, Sergio Zyman, Tab Clear was released at the same time, as an intentional &quot;kamikaze&quot; effort to create an unpopular beverage that was positioned as an analogue of Crystal Pepsi to &quot;kill both in the process&quot;. The &quot;born to die&quot; strategy included using the poor-performing Tab brand rather than Coke, labeling the product as a &quot;sugar free&quot; diet drink to confuse consumers into thinking Crystal Pepsi had no sugar, and marketing the product as if it were &quot;medicinal&quot;. Zyman said &quot;Pepsi spent an enormous amount of money on the brand and, regardless, we killed it. Both of them were dead within six months.&quot;

Yum! Brands chairman David C. Novak is credited with introducing the Crystal Pepsi concept. In a December 2007 interview, he reminisced:
==Reception==
In its first year, Crystal Pepsi captured 1% of U.S. soft drink sales, or approximately . &quot;Beverage Digest&quot; said &quot;This is another instance where Pepsi has really shown leadership to strike out in a new direction.&quot; Crystal Pepsi was named Best New Product of the Year for 1992 by Richard Saunders International, based on consumer preference polls among 16,000 new grocery products, scoring higher than any other beverage in the poll&#x27;s history. Robert McMath, editor of &quot;Brand Week&quot;, said that &quot;new sells [and] clarity equals purity&quot; but he doubted the strategy of positioning such a new and different product directly alongside the old flagship product.

===Consumer revival===
In September 2014, following a Facebook campaign by consumers, The Coca-Cola Company reintroduced the soft drink Surge, leading to speculation in the public and media about the return of Crystal Pepsi. In March 2015, an online grassroots campaign began to bring back Crystal Pepsi. The following month, a second, separate petition was led by an online competitive eating personality, Kevin Strahle, also known as The L.A. Beast, who had made a 2013 viral video of himself drinking a 1990s vintage bottle of Crystal Pepsi. This generated enough interest for a telephone and email campaign, garnering around 37,000 Change.org petition signatures, tens of thousands of Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram tagged comments, 15 billboards erected around the Los Angeles area, and a commitment to ride a mobile billboard truck at Pepsi&#x27;s headquarters in Purchase, New York with a gathering of supporters at a park nearby on June 15 and 16, 2015.

The interest from this campaign led to an official response to Strahle by PepsiCo on June 8, 2015: &quot;We&#x27;ve had customers ask us to bring back their favorite products before, but never with your level of enthusiasm and humor. We&#x27;re lucky to have a Pepsi superfan like you on our side. We definitely hear you and your followers and we think you&#x27;ll all be happy with what&#x27;s in store. Stay tuned.&quot; In mid-2016, Crystal Pepsi was released for a limited time across the United States and Canada, promoted with a retro styled website and marketing video, including &quot;The Crystal Pepsi Trail&quot; browser game as an officially licensed parody of the classic &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;.

<text>Arthur Godfrey and His Friends is an American television variety show hosted by Arthur Godfrey. The hour-long series aired on CBS Television from January 12, 1949, to June 1957 (as &quot;The Arthur Godfrey Show&quot; after September 1956), then again as a half-hour show from September 1958 to April 1959.

Many of Godfrey&#x27;s musical acts were culled from &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, which was airing on CBS at the same time. The singers included Frank Parker, Marion Marlowe, Janette Davis, Julius La Rosa, The Mariners, The McGuire Sisters, Carmel Quinn, Pat Boone, Lu Ann Simms, and The Chordettes. The show was live, and Godfrey often did away with the script and improvised. In addition, unlike his morning show &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time,&quot; the evening show often presented celebrity guests. He refused to participate in commercials for products he did not believe in.

The series was a hit in the Nielsen ratings in the early to mid 1950s, often finishing just behind &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;. It ranked #18 in the 1950–1951 season, #6 in 1951–1952, #3 in 1952–1953, #6 in 1953-1954 and #22 in 1954–1955. &quot;Arthur Godfrey and His Friends&quot; also earned a nomination for an Emmy Award in 1953 for Best Variety Program.

Sponsors included Viva lipstick and Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company.

<text>Grazhdanskaya Oborona (Russian: Гражданская оборона, , Russian for &quot;Civil Defense&quot;, or ГО, often referred to as ГрОб, Russian for &quot;coffin&quot;) were a Soviet-Russian rock band formed by Yegor Letov and Konstantin Ryabinov in Omsk, USSR, in 1984. They were one of the earliest Soviet and Russian psychedelic/punk rock bands. They influenced many Soviet and, subsequently, Russian bands. From the early 1990s, the band&#x27;s music began to evolve in the direction of psychedelic rock and shoegaze, and band leader Yegor Letov&#x27;s lyrics became more metaphysical than political.

==History==

=== Formation and early years ===

In 1982 the 18-year-old poet and musician Yegor Letov formed the band Posev (&quot;The Sowing&quot;, named after the official NTS magazine) with his friend Konstantin &quot;Kuzya UO&quot; Ryabinov. In 1984 Posev became Grazhdanskaya Oborona. The band was preparing to record an album, but their defiantly anti-authoritarian stance and overtly political lyrics made them an easy target for the KGB. &quot;The mother of our [second guitarist] Babenko, she was a sort of a party official, she listened to our records and went to the KGB and said, &quot;Comrades, my son is involved in an anti-Soviet organization&quot;, Letov recalled. In autumn 1985 Letov was committed to a mental ward, and Ryabinov was forcibly drafted into the army despite having a heart condition. Letov was released from the mental ward in March 1986 and immediately began to write and record music. He often recorded on his own, and while he credited other musicians, his collaborators went under pseudonyms as Letov remained on the outs with the Soviet system and, as he stated in an interview, the original members of GrOb were forced to sign sworn statements saying that they would stay away from Letov. In 1986–87 he recorded several cassette albums, playing all instruments himself, and released them through &quot;magnitizdat&quot; under the name of Grazhdanskaya Oborona. It was lo-fi, straightforward garage punk rock/post-punk with slight reggae influences and exquisite, irrational lyrics, inspired mainly by Russian Futurist poetry.

=== 1987–1990 ===

In 1987 Letov was invited to perform at the Novosibirsk rock festival. &quot;We weren&#x27;t even going to play&quot;, Letov said, &quot;but Zvuki Mu didn’t come and Murzin suggested that we play instead.&quot;. After all, he played a set with his friends Oleg and Evgeny Lischenko (from the local band Pik Klakson) under the deliberately provocative name Адольф Гитлер (Adolf Hitler), which would be released on CD in 2016. When Letov returned home, he found out the authorities were going to put him to a mental ward again. He immediately left the city with his then-partner, the fellow Siberian songwriter Yanka Dyagileva, and spent the entire year in hiding, hitch-hiking across the country until the prosecution was stopped in December 1987 with the help of Letov&#x27;s relatives.

In winter 1988 Letov returned home and recorded three more albums (also released under the name of Grazhdanskaya Oborona) in his home &quot;studio&quot;, known as &quot;GrOb Records&quot;. In the same year the reunited band started touring across the USSR.

In 1989 Grazhdanskaya Oborona released four noise rock/industrial-influenced albums (&quot;Война, Армагеддон-Попс, Здорово и вечно&quot; and &quot;Русское поле экспериментов&quot;), often considered their best. Letov&#x27;s lyrics became darker and more elaborate, inspired by Existentialist philosophy and literature (the Soviet proto-Existentialist writer Andrei Platonov in particular). Some songs (e.g. &quot;Насекомые&quot; (&quot;Insects&quot;) from &quot;Армагеддон-Попс&quot;, &quot;Заговор&quot; (&quot;Spell&quot;) from &quot;Здорово и вечно&quot;) also show his interest in Siberian folklore and pre-Christian beliefs. In the same year Letov, Kuzya and Oleg &quot;Manager&quot; Sudakov started a conceptual, Sots Art-like side project Коммунизм (Communism), where they combined kitschy Soviet art and Stalinist poetry with noise experimentation. GrOb also collaborated with Yanka Dyagileva, who recorded with them two albums (&quot;Ангедония&quot; and &quot;Домой!&quot;, both released in 1989).

In 1990, Grazhdanskaya Oborona broke up after playing their final concert in Tallinn: Letov stated he was afraid they would turn into a &quot;commercial pseudo-counterculture project&quot; and decided to put the band on hiatus. After that he started the psychedelic rock project Egor i Opizdenevshie with Kuzya and Igor Zhevtun. They recorded and released two albums, &quot;Прыг-Скок&quot; (Pryg-Skok, &quot;Hop-Hop&quot;) and &quot;Сто лет одиночества&quot; (Sto Let Odinochestva, &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;) (an outtakes compilation, &quot;Психоделия Tomorrow&quot;, was released in 2001). In 1990, Letov ranked &quot;Русское поле экспериментов&quot; and &quot;Прыг-Скок&quot; as his best works.

=== 1993–1997 ===

In 1993, Grazhdanskaya Oborona reformed and began playing live again, but no new material was released until 1997. In 1996, their entire discography was remastered and given an official cassette issue for the first time on the fledgling XOP label, which was a sublabel of Moroz Records used to release Letov-related material. In 1995, the anthemic, shoegaze-y &quot;Solntsevorot&quot; () was recorded, followed by &quot;Nevynosimaya lyogkost bytiya&quot; () in 1996. Both albums were released in 1997.

As the most prominent figure in Siberian rock, Letov was often a source of contradiction. In the early 1990s, he became one of the founders of the National Bolshevik Party, despite his formerly strong opposition to despotism and nationalism. He ceased contact with the party around 1999 and distanced himself from politics. In his 2007 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone Russia&quot;, Letov stated: &quot;In fact, I have always been an anarchist – and I still am. But now I&#x27;m more into ecological aspects of contemporary anarchism, eco-anarchism, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been moving toward recently&quot;.

In 1999, after their first US tour, Kuzya left the band due to personal circumstances. On 28 December of the same year, the group&#x27;s guitarist Evgeny &quot;Makhno&quot; Pyanov died after falling from the window of his apartment after a long night of drinking. He was 27 years old. Letov recruited a new guitarist (Alexander Chesnakov) and invited his wife Natalia Chumakova, whom he had met the year before, to play the bass.

=== 2000–2008 ===
In 2002, Letov produced &quot;Zvezdopad&quot; (), an album of covers of Soviet-era songs. In the 2000s, many Russian groups recorded and performed tributes to GrOb, and in 2005, the group toured the United States. In 2004–05, the group released the critically acclaimed pair of albums &quot;Dolgaya Schastlivaya Zhizn&quot;&#x27; () (2004) and &quot;Reanimatsiya&quot; () (2005).

On 8 February 2004, at a GrOb concert at the Ural Palace of Culture in Ekaterinburg, a 19-year-old skinhead bashed a 23-year-old non-Slavic fan to death. The following day, Letov posted a note on the official GrOb website, &quot;Official statement from E. Letov and GrOb regarding the events at Ekaterinburg&quot;, stating the band were &quot;patriots, but not Nazis&quot;, disavowing any neo-Nazis who claimed to be fans of the group, linking neo-Nazism to the communism the band had grown up with and telling &quot;totalitarians on the left and right and of all colours and stripes&quot; to &quot;fuck off&quot;, saying &quot;We kindly request you no longer associate your stink with our activities&quot;.

Letov&#x27;s last album, &quot;Zachem Snyatsya Sny?&quot; () was released in 2007. In an interview in January 2008, Letov said that this album might be his last. This album was recorded as usual in the &quot;GrOb studio&quot;, but is not typical of the band&#x27;s earlier output. It is much brighter – Letov described it as &quot;shining&quot;. There are fewer songs with themes of tragedy, rage and turmoil on this album than in previous ones; there are no coarse words in it, and Letov&#x27;s voice sounds natural and calm.

Letov died on 19 February 2008 in his sleep at his home in Omsk from heart and respiratory failure. He was 43 years old.

=== 2019–2020 ===
In 2019, the group reformed and announced a tour to celebrate its 35th anniversary, with Letov replaced by various collaborators, such as Igor Zhevtun (who substituted for Letov on some songs on &quot;Instruktsiya po vyzhivaniyu&quot; due to Letov having lost his voice), Oleg Sudakov (who managed Kommunizm) and Ryabinov.

The final concert of the tour took place on 23 February 2020 at the Glastonberry club in Moscow. This also proved to be Ryabinov&#x27;s final public appearance – he died of a stroke several weeks later on 16 March, aged 55.

The tour caused controversy as Natalia Chumakova did not want to participate and strongly denounced it on her social media platforms.

== Musical style ==

While their earlier work (1984–1988) can be described as minimalist lo-fi punk rock/post-punk with dirty, garage sound (although there also was significant number of reggae songs on 1987/88 albums), in the late 1980s the band&#x27;s sound leaned toward noise rock and industrial, occasionally drawing inspiration from Russian folk tunes. In the 1990s, GrOb&#x27;s music became brighter and more &quot;anthemic&quot;, incorporating shoegaze and psychedelic rock elements, and some late GrOb albums even can be classified as art rock (for example, &quot;Zvezdopad&quot;).

Letov was a big fan of 60s garage and psychedelic rock and named Arthur Lee&#x27;s Love as his favourite band, along with The Seeds, The Monks and others. Other favourites included Butthole Surfers, The Residents, Sonic Youth, CBGB artists such as Ramones and Television, and Psychic TV. In the February 2007 web interview he said that in the late 80&#x27;s he &quot;listened only to noise and industrial – such bands as Einstürzende Neubauten, Test Dept., Throbbing Gristle, SPK, Young Gods&quot;, adding: &quot;Now I still like and &#x27;respect&#x27; such music and listen to it from time to time, but not that often&quot;. When asked about &quot;newer&quot; bands he liked, he named Japanese psychedelic bands Acid Mothers Temple, Mainliner and Green Milk from the Planet Orange, the Swiss feminist cabaret ensemble Les Reines prochaines, the Argentinian experimental band Reynols and the neo-garage band Marshmallow Overcoat. He referred to Mark E. Smith (of The Fall), Bob Dylan, Arthur Lee and Patti Smith as his favourite rock lyricists.

<doc id="575041" wikidata="Q196070" url="?curid=575041" title="Uhuru Kenyatta">
<text>Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta ( born 26 October 1961) is a Kenyan politician who served as the fourth president of Kenya from 2013 to 2022. The son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya&#x27;s first president, he previously served as Deputy Prime Minister from 2008 to 2013.

Daniel Arap Moi had picked Kenyatta as his preferred successor. However, he was defeated by the then opposition leader Mwai Kibaki in the 2002 election, and Kibaki was subsequently sworn in as the President. Kenyatta served as the member of parliament (MP) for Gatundu South from 2002 to 2013 and also as Deputy Prime Minister to Raila Odinga from 2008 to 2013. Currently he is a member and the party leader of the Jubilee Party of Kenya, whose popularity has since dwindled. Kenyatta was previously a member of the Kenya Africa National Union (KANU), a political party that had led Kenya to independence in 1963. He resigned from KANU in 2012 and joined The National Alliance (TNA), one of the allied parties that campaigned for his election victory during the 2013 election. He later on went to form a merger with the United Republican Party (URP) led by William Ruto to form the Jubilee Party.

Kenyatta was re-elected for a second and final term in the August 2017 general elections, winning 54% of the popular vote. The win was formally declared on national television by the Chairperson of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), Wafula Chebukati. However, Uhuru&#x27;s election was challenged in the Supreme Court of Kenya by his main competitor, Raila Odinga. On 1 September 2017, the court declared the election invalid and ordered a new presidential election to take place within 60 days from the day of the ruling. A new presidential election was held on 26 October, which he won, with 39.03% electoral voter participation.

==Early life==

Uhuru Kenyatta was born on 26 October 1961, to the first president of Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta, and his fourth wife, Mama Ngina Kenyatta (née Muhoho). The second born in the family, he has two sisters, Christine (born 1953), Anna Nyokabi (born 1963) and a brother, Muhoho Kenyatta (born 1965).

His family hails from the Kikuyu, a Bantu ethnic group. His given name &quot;Uhuru&quot; is from the Swahili term for &quot;freedom&quot; and was given to him in anticipation of Kenya&#x27;s upcoming independence. Uhuru attended St Mary&#x27;s School in Nairobi. Between 1979 and 1980, he also briefly worked as a teller at the Kenya Commercial Bank.

After attending St. Mary&#x27;s school, Uhuru went on to study economics, political science and government at Amherst College in the United States. Upon his graduation, Uhuru returned to Kenya, and started a company, Wilham Kenya Limited, through which he sourced and exported agricultural produce.

Uhuru was nominated to Parliament in 1999, he then became the Minister for Local Government under President Daniel Arap Moi and, despite his political inexperience, was favoured by Moi as his successor. Kenyatta ran as KANU&#x27;s candidate in the December 2002 presidential election, but lost to the opposition candidate Mwai Kibaki by a big margin. He subsequently became Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. He backed Hon. Mwai Kibaki for re-election in the December 2007 presidential election and was named Minister of Local Government by Former President Mwai Kibaki in January 2008, before being appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade in April 2008 as part of the new coalition government.

Subsequently, Uhuru Kenyatta was Minister of Finance from 2009 to 2012, while remaining Deputy Prime Minister. Accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of committing crimes against humanity in relation to the violent aftermath of the 2007 election, he resigned as Minister of Finance on 26 January 2012. He was elected as President of Kenya in the March 2013 presidential election, defeating Raila Odinga with a slim majority in a single round of voting.

==Political life==

In the 1997 general election, Uhuru Kenyatta contested for the Gatundu South Constituency parliamentary seat, once held by his father, but lost to Moses Mwihia, a Nairobi architect.

In 1999, Moi appointed Uhuru to chair the Kenya Tourism Board, a government parastatal. In 2001, he was nominated as a Member of Parliament, and joined the Cabinet as Minister for Local Government. He would also later be elected First Vice Chairman of KANU.

In the 2002 nomination process, which was widely thought as undemocratic and underhand, Moi influenced Uhuru Kenyatta&#x27;s nomination as KANU&#x27;s preferred presidential candidate, sparking an outcry from other interested contenders and a massive exit from the party ensued. This move by the late President Moi was seen as a ploy to install Uhuru as a puppet so that even in retirement, Moi would still rule the country through Uhuru and presumably insulate himself against the numerous charges of abuse of office that plagued his presidency.

Uhuru finished second to Mwai Kibaki in the General Elections, with 31% of the vote. He conceded defeat and took up an active leadership role as Leader of the Opposition.

In January 2005, Uhuru Kenyatta defeated Nicholas Biwott for chairmanship of KANU, taking 2,980 votes among party delegates against Biwott&#x27;s 622 votes.

Uhuru led his party KANU in the referendum campaigns against the draft constitution in 2005, having teamed up with the Liberal Democratic Party, a rebel faction in the Kibaki government, to form the Orange Democratic Movement. The result of this was a vote against the adoption of the draft constitution by a noticeable margin, which was a great political embarrassment to Emilio Mwai Kibaki.

In November 2006, Kenyatta was displaced as KANU leader by the late Nicholas Biwott. On 28 December 2006, the High Court of Kenya reinstated Uhuru Kenyatta as KANU chairman. However, further court proceedings followed. On 28 June 2007, the High Court confirmed Kenyatta as party leader, ruling that there was insufficient evidence for Biwott&#x27;s argument that Kenyatta had joined another party.

In the run up to the 2007 general election, he led KANU to join a coalition (called Party of National Unity &quot;PNU&quot;) with President Mwai Kibaki who was running for a second term against Raila Odinga. PNU won the controversial 2007 elections but the dispute over the poll resulted in the 2007–08 Kenyan crisis.

Under an agreement between the two parties to end the chaos, Kibaki remained as president in a power sharing agreement with Raila as Prime Minister, while Uhuru Kenyatta was Kibaki&#x27;s choice as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister For Finance in his share of Cabinet slots.

On 13 September 2007, Uhuru Kenyatta withdrew from the December 2007 presidential election in favour of Kibaki for re-election. He said that he did not want to run unless he could be sure of winning.

Following the election, amidst the controversy that resulted when Kibaki was declared the victor despite claims of fraud from challenger Raila Odinga and his Orange Democratic Movement, Kibaki appointed Kenyatta as Minister for Local Government on 8 January 2008.

After Kibaki and Odinga reached a power-sharing agreement, Kenyatta was named Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade on 13 April 2008, as part of the Grand Coalition Cabinet. He was the Deputy Prime Minister representing the PNU, while another Deputy Prime Minister, Musalia Mudavadi, represented the ODM.

Kenyatta and the rest of the Cabinet were sworn in on 17 April. Uhuru Kenyatta was later moved from Local Government and appointed Minister for Finance on 23 January 2009. During his tenure, he spearheaded a number of reform measures that changed how treasury and government by extension transact business, such as the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) and a fund for the inclusion of the informal sector in the mainstream economy.

In 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta was elected as the 4th President of Kenya under The National Alliance (TNA), which was part of the &quot;Jubilee Alliance&quot; with his running mate William Ruto&#x27;s United Republican Party (URP). Uhuru and Ruto won 50.07% of votes cast, with closest rivals, Raila Odinga and running mate Kalonzo Musyoka of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy garnering 42%.

Raila Amolo Odinga disputed the election results at the Supreme Court which however held (7–0) that the election of Uhuru was valid and such irregularities as existed did not make a difference to the final outcome. Uhuru Kenyatta was therefore sworn in as president on 9 April 2013.

Uhuru ran for president in the elections held on 4 March 2013 and garnered 6,173,433 votes (50.03%) out of the 12,338,667 votes cast. As this was above the 50% plus 1 vote threshold, he won the election in the first round thus evading a run-off between the top two candidates. He was, therefore, declared the fourth President of the Republic of Kenya by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).

According to the IEBC, Raila Odinga garnered 5,340,546 votes (43.4%) and was thus the second in the field of eight candidates. CORD, under the leadership of presidential candidate Raila Odinga, lodged a petition with the Supreme Court of Kenya on 10 March 2013 challenging Uhuru&#x27;s election.

On 30 March 2013, Dr Willy Mutunga, the Chief Justice of Kenya, read the unanimous Supreme Court ruling declaring the election of Uhuru Kenyatta and his running-mate, William Ruto, as valid. On 11 August 2017, the Chairman of the IEBC, Wafula Chebukati announced Uhuru&#x27;s reelection to a second term in office during the 2017 Kenyan general election, with 54% of the popular vote. This was later contested in court and annulled. Innulment, a second election was required in which Uhuru Kenyatta won with 98% of the vote with a 39% voter turnout.

On 9 March 2018 Uhuru Kenyatta agreed on a truce between the opposition leader, Raila Odinga. This action marked the country&#x27;s watershed moment that redrew its political architecture. On 27 November 2019, Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Building Bridges Initiatives (BBI) in Bomas of Kenya. This is one of the outcomes as a result of the truce with the opposition leader Raila Odinga as its implementations will foresee some amendments in the Kenyan Constitution.

===International Criminal Court Charges===

Prior to him becoming president, Kenyatta was named as a suspect of crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, for planning and funding violence in Naivasha and Nakuru. This was in relation to the violence that followed the bungled national elections of December 2007. In furtherance of his political support for Kibaki&#x27;s PNU at the time, he was accused of organising a Kikuyu politico-religious group, the Mungiki, in the post-election violence. Overall, the post-election violence of 2007 is said to have claimed about 1300 lives. Uhuru maintained his innocence and wanted his name cleared. On 8 March 2011, while serving as minister in Kibaki&#x27;s government, he was indicted after being summoned to appear before the ICC pre-trial chamber. He was to appear at The Hague on 8 April 2011 alongside five other suspects.
On 29 September 2011, while seeking to exonerate himself, Uhuru Kenyatta put up a spirited fight as he was being cross-examined by ICC Chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo in The Hague, denying any links with the outlawed Mungiki sect. He said Prime Minister Raila Odinga should take political responsibility for the acts of violence and killings that followed the 2007 presidential elections in Kenya. He told the three judges that &quot;by telling his supporters election results were being rigged, fanned tensions and then failed to use his influence to quell the violence that followed the announcement of the 2007 presidential results.&quot;

Though Uhuru had previously dismissed ICC summons, he changed his decision along the way. Together with his two other co-accused suspects, Head of Civil Service, Ambassador Francis Muthaura and former Police Commissioner Hussein Ali, the trio honoured the ICC Summons that sought to determine whether their cases met the set standards for international trials. On 23 January 2012, the ICC confirmed the cases against Kenyatta and Muthaura although the charges against Muthaura were subsequently dropped. Serious concerns about the case have been raised, particularly the nature of the evidence being used against Kenyatta. There are also serious concerns about witness tampering and indeed, a number of witnesses have disappeared or died, which is the reason cited by the ICC for dropping charges against Mathaura. On a 12 October 2013 speech to the African Union in which he set a belligerent tone, Uhuru accused the ICC of being &quot;a toy of declining imperial powers&quot;.

On 31 October 2013, the ICC postponed Kenyatta&#x27;s trial for crimes against humanity by three months until 5 February 2014 after the defense had requested more time.

On 8 October 2014, Kenyatta appeared before the ICC in The Hague. He was called to appear at the ICC &quot;status conference&quot; when the prosecution said evidence needed to go ahead with a trial was being withheld. In a speech to the Kenyan parliament Kenyatta said that he was going to The Hague in a personal capacity — not as president of the country — so as not to compromise the sovereignty of Kenyans. Kenyatta did not speak in court, but denied the charges in comments to journalists as he left the court to catch a flight back home. &quot;We as Kenyans, we know where we came from, we know where we are going, and nobody will tell us what to do,&quot; he said. The judges adjourned the hearings and charges were dropped on 13 March 2015.

==The National Alliance Party (TNA)==
On 20 May 2012, Uhuru Kenyatta attended the elaborately assembled and much-publicized launch of The National Alliance party in a modern high-tech dome at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. His presence at the TNA launch was a strong indication that he would contest for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination ticket in his quest for the presidency in the 2013 General Elections.

The Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister Eugene Wamalwa and Eldoret North Constituency MP William Ruto led more than 70 MPs in attending the function. The Speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly, Abdi Ramadhan, Cabinet Ministers Mohamed Yusuf Haji, Jamleck Irungu Kamau, Dr. Naomi Shaaban, Samuel Poghisio, Professor Sam Ongeri and Dr. Mohammed Kuti and MPs Charles Cheruiyot Keter, Aden Bare Duale and Mohamed Maalim Mohamud also attended the event.

Speeches at the launch revolved around the need for a thriving economy, the need for the rights of people of all classes in society to be championed, the need for peaceful co-existence, the need for visionary and committed leadership, the need for transformative leadership, the need for a youthful crop of committed professionals in leadership, the need for free and fair nomination and election processes in the General Election, the need for an economically empowered youth and a call to bring an end to divisive and sectarian interests in politics to safeguard Kenya from sliding to dictatorship. Machel Waikenda was the director of communications and secretary of arts and entertainment of the National Alliance, from April 2012 to August 2013 and he led the media and communications department of the party during the 2013 elections.

===By-elections (17 September 2012)===
On 17 September 2012, The National Alliance party had its first real test when it contested various civic and parliamentary positions in a by-election that covered 17 seats in total; 3 parliamentary and 14 civic. Overall, 133,054 votes were cast in the by-elections and TNA led the pack after it garnered 38.89% or 51,878 votes, followed by Orange Democratic Movement with 33.7% or 44,837 votes, Party of National Unity with 4.46% or 5,929 votes, Wiper Democratic Movement with 4.44% or 5,912 votes and United Democratic Forum with 4.15% or 5,520 votes.

TNA won civic and parliamentary seats in 7 different counties while its closest challengers, ODM won seats in 4 counties.
The National Alliance Party remained a strong contender for the following year&#x27;s general elections, having received major defections from other big political parties of Kenya. The successful election of TNA&#x27;s main candidates (Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto) continued to enhance TNA&#x27;s viability.

In January 2013, however, TNA merged with URP to form the Jubilee Alliance Party (JAP).

==2013 presidential elections==
Uhuru Kenyatta&#x27;s party, The National Alliance (TNA) joined William Ruto&#x27;s United Republican Party (URP), Najib Balala&#x27;s Republican Congress Party (RCP) and Charity Ngilu&#x27;s National Rainbow Coalition party to form the Jubilee Alliance coalition. Various opinion polls prior to the election placed Uhuru as one of the main contenders, and his Jubilee Alliance as among the most popular. The other formidable coalition was the Coalition For Reform and Democracy (CORD), led by Raila Odinga.

In undercover video footage, released in a BBC news report on 19 March 2018, the managing director of Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked to elect Donald Trump in the 2016 American presidential election, boasted that his firm had run successful presidential election campaigns in Kenya in 2013 and 2017, though he did not name Kenyatta explicitly. &quot;We have re-branded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging,&quot; Turnbull said, of the campaigns that his company managed in Kenya. &quot;I think we wrote all the speeches, and we staged the whole thing—so just about every element of this candidate.&quot; A Jubilee Party vice president admitted on 20 March 2018, that the party had hired an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica for &quot;branding&quot; in the 2017 election.

Uhuru Kenyatta was officially declared the president elect on Saturday 9 March at 2:44 pm.

As per the IEBC&#x27;s official results, Uhuru got 6,173,433 of the 12,221,053 valid votes cast ahead of the second placed Raila Odinga who garnered 5,340,546 (43.7%). Uhuru&#x27;s result was 50.51% of the vote and was above the 50% plus 1 vote threshold set out in the 2010 constitution, thus making him the president-elect.

===Results dispute===

There was some discontent with the official results, as would be expected in such a hotly contested election, especially in Raila Odinga&#x27;s strongholds. The inordinate delay in releasing the results and the technical failure of some safeguards and election equipment deployed by the IEBC did not help the perception that the election had been less than free and fair.

Further, an exit poll conducted by UCSD Professor Clark Gibson and James Long, Asst. Prof. and University of Washington suggested that neither Odinga nor Kenyatta had attained the 50% plus one vote threshold. Analysts have contended that even though elections for five other levels were held in Kenya at the same time, their national turnout levels and total vote tallies were about 16% less than the presidential total; e.g. while 10.6 million voters elected candidates for member of the National Assembly, the Senate and the 47 gubernatorial seats, almost 2 million more voted in the presidential election. This has fueled concern and speculations of vote manipulation in President Kenyatta&#x27;s favor.

Two groups disputed these results and filed petitions challenging various aspects of it at the Supreme Court of Kenya to contest the result. The groups were the Coalition For Reform and Democracy, CORD, led by Raila Odinga, and the Africa Centre for Open Governance (AFRICOG). Uhuru Kenyatta and his running mate were respondents in these cases and were represented by Fred Ngatia and Katwa Kigen respectively.

===Supreme Court Judgement===
The Supreme court judges unanimously upheld the election of Uhuru Kenyatta as Kenya&#x27;s fourth president after rejecting Raila Odinga&#x27;s petition in a verdict delivered on Saturday 30 March 2013. Chief Justice Willy Mutunga in his ruling said the elections were indeed conducted in compliance with the Constitution and the law. 

===Presidential swearing-in at Kasarani Stadium===
After the Supreme Court dismissed the petitions the swearing in ceremony was held on 9 April 2013 at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, Nairobi, in accordance to Article 141 (2) (b) of the constitution which stipulates that in case the Supreme Court upholds the victory of the president-elect, the swearing in will take place on &quot;the first Tuesday following the seventh day following the date on which the court renders a decision declaring the election to be valid&quot;.

==Presidency (2013–2022)==

During his inaugural speech, Uhuru promised economic transformation through Vision 2030, unity among all Kenyans, free maternal care and that he will serve all Kenyans. He also promised to improve the standards of education in Kenya. During the Madaraka day Celebrations, a national holiday celebrated to the country&#x27;s independence on 1 June, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced free maternal care in all public health facilities, a move that was welcomed by many Kenyans.

On 1 September 2017, the Supreme Court of Kenya nullified the re-election of Uhuru Kenyatta after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) had announced him the winner on 8 August 2017. As a result of that, there was a need for the election to be held once again. It was scheduled for 26 October 2017. After the reelection, Uhuru Kenyatta emerged the winner once again.

He was sworn in on 28 November 2017 for his second presidential term.

In 2021, drought is again taking its toll. According to the UN, more than 465,000 children under the age of five are malnourished. Food insecurity affects more than 2.5 million people in the country. Uhuru Kenyatta speaks of a &quot;national disaster&quot;. However, he is criticised for the slow humanitarian response and lack of planning.

The Mukuru Kwa Njenga slum in Nairobi is being razed in October 2021 to make way for the widening of a road, leaving 40,000 people homeless overnight, with no offer of alternative accommodation.

===Challenges===
The major challenges his administration faced included high cost of living, rising public debt, a high public wage bill and allegations of corruption among people within his government. The 2017 general election and its violence is also a challenge that threatened not only his presidency but also the future of the East African Nation.

====Public Wage Bill====
The high public wage was a headache to Uhuru&#x27;s administration. At the start of his term, the President decried the high wage bill which was at 12% of GDP (as against a recommended 7%). In 2015, the President stated that the wage bill was at 50% of the total annual revenue collection of government. In an attempt to curtail it, the President announced a pay cut for himself and his Cabinet in March 2014, reducing his salary by 20%. It was hoped that the high earners in government would follow suit but this did not materialize. Another measure was the newly created constitutional Salaries and Remuneration Commission which it was hoped would regularize salaries but it has faced an up hill battle against Members of Parliament, who wish to protect their earnings and labor unions. The President thereafter ordered an audit of the government payroll so as to flush out ghost workers. The audit identified 12,000 ghost workers. In the meantime, lower cadre government workers have demanded pay rises, more so by teachers and health workers, who have gone on strikes at various times to demand the increase. The strikes in the health sector mainly affect the counties, Kenya&#x27;s other level of government, as it is managed by the devolved units.

====Anti-corruption efforts====

On 28 June 2018, Kenyatta declared a major crackdown on corruption and stated that no one was immune from corruption charges in Kenya. Kenyatta also stated his own brother Muhoho, a director in a company that had been accused in parliament of importing contraband sugar, should be charged if there is clear evidence against him.

On 11 August 2018, Mohammed Abdalla Swazuri, the chairman of National Land Commission, and Atanas Kariuki Maina, managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation, were among 18 officials, businesspeople and companies arrested on corruption charges involving land allocation for the $3 billion flagship Nairobi-Mombasa railway. On 7 December 2018, Joe Sang, the CEO of the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC), was arrested with four other senior officials in connection with the loss of an unspecified amount of money during the construction of an oil jetty in the western city of Kisumu. On 22 July 2019, Kenya&#x27;s finance minister Henry Rotich became the country&#x27;s first sitting minister to be arrested for corruption. 27 other people were arrested with Rotich as well. On 6 December 2019, federal authorities arrested Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on corruption charges. On 14 January 2020, Kenyatta replaced Rotich with Labour Secretary Ukur Yatani.

On 28 May 2020, a breakthrough in Kenyatta&#x27;s pledge to combat corruption in Kenya occurred when 40 civil servants and 14 private sector officials, including National Youth Service (NYS) Director General Richard Ndubai, were arrested on charges related to the National Youth Service scandal.

On 9 December 2020, it was confirmed by the Kenya News Agency that the National Anti-Corruption Campaign Steering Committee (NACCSC) was in the process of strengthening its collaboration with other crime fighting agencies, including those in Kenyatta&#x27;s government. The group had National Government Administrative Officers (NGAO) in hopes they would support the County Anti-Corruption Civil Oversight Committee (CACCOC). The day before, Winnie Guchu, who serves in Kenyatta&#x27;s government as the Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) in the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice, confirmed in a press conference that she had met with members of CACCOC to strengthen relations. On 11 December 2020, the Kenyan government&#x27;s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) released a statement confirming that Robert Pavel Oimeke, the director general of Kenya&#x27;s Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority, was arrested and taken into police custody on charges of demanding 200,000 Kenyan shillings ($1,795) to approve the re-opening of a petrol station that had been shut down over violations. On 21 December 2020, Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Benson Mutura replaced Sonko, who was removed from office four days prior, as Governor of Nairobi.

In October 2021, his name appeared in the Pandora Papers, among more than 330 current and former politicians and senior officials using hidden accounts in tax havens. He and six family members, including his mother, a brother and two sisters, have at least $30 million in several offshore companies. He also owns a secret &#x27;foundation&#x27; in Panama, holding over $30 million.

===Foreign relations===

As the President, Kenyatta&#x27;a foreign relations were dominated by the ICC question. His relations with the West were expected to be cold, more so after the West warned Kenyans not to elect him as president. The United Kingdom promised to have only essential contacts with him if he were elected. However, his relationship with the West thawed significantly and he participated in the US — Africa summit as well as a Somalia summit in the United Kingdom. The ICC accused his government of frustrating its investigation efforts into the case, although it absolved the President personally of any involvement in the frustration.

His activities, however, were more robust at the African level where he has pushed more intra-Africa trade and economic independence of African nations. In November 2014, he launched consultations to reform the United Nations Security Council to expand the voice of Africa in the council. He successfully rallied the AU against the ICC culminating in an Extraordinary Summit of the African Heads of State which resolved that sitting African Heads of State should not appear before the ICC. The AU further asked the Security Council to suspend his trial at the ICC; for the first time ever, the Security Council resolution was defeated by abstention with 9 members of the Council abstaining rather than voting against so as not to offend Kenyatta. The Assembly of State Parties of the ICC would two days later amend the ICC statute to allow for one to appear by video link, a proposal President Kenyatta had made when he was Deputy Prime Minister.
Kenyatta led and negotiated peace agreements in South Sudan and in Democratic Republic of Congo. At the East African level, he developed a close relationship with the Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwanda President Paul Kagame, creating the Coalition of the Willing, a caucus within the EAC that has signed on to more joint development and economic agreements than the other EAC partners, including a joint tourist visa.

He attended the funeral of Nelson Mandela and was received warmly by the crowds. He also attended the funeral of President Michael Sata of Zambia in November 2014. However, it had been perceived that his administration&#x27;s relations with Botswana were strained due to Botswana&#x27;s support of the ICC process. He visited Botswana to remove this perception and Botswana voted in favor of the AU&#x27;s ICC Resolution.

As expected, his government had closer ties with China which was funding most of his infrastructure projects.

==Foreign trips==

In November 2020, it was noted that he was the most traveled Kenyan president compared to his predecessors. One of the leading national newspapers noted that Uhuru Kenyatta had been out of the country 43 times as of November 2015 in a period of about three years since he took office in 2013, as compared to 33 times over a span of 10 years by his predecessor Mwai Kibaki. The president&#x27;s strategic communications unit came out in defense of these trips stating that these trips had yielded more than what it cost the taxpayers to finance them.

==Pandora Papers listing==
In October 2021, Kenyatta was named in the Pandora Papers leak. BBC reported that &quot;The Kenyattas&#x27; offshore investments, including a company with stocks and bonds worth $30m (£22m), were discovered among hundreds of thousands of pages of administrative paperwork from the archives of 14 law firms and service providers in Panama and the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and other tax havens.&quot;

==Approval ratings==
His government&#x27;s first year in office received low ratings from the general public. This is after a poll by Synovate indicated that more than half of the population was unhappy with how the government had conducted its affairs. The same polls also ranked the presidency as the second most trusted institution after the media. After his appearance at The Hague for his ICC case in October 2014, his poll ratings improved to 71%, according to a poll by Synovate. A poll by Gallup in August 2014 put his approval ratings at 78%, giving him the third best job approval ratings among African Presidents after Ian Khama of Botswana and Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta of Mali. In 2015, due to allegations of corruption against some members of his government, his poll ratings dropped to his lowest rating yet at 33%, according to an Infotrack poll. By February 2017, his poll numbers had, however, risen to 57%. His poll numbers in 2018 rose to 74% in light of a renewed effort to battle corruption.

==Post-presidency==
In 2025, Kenyatta was appointed as a mediator by the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community in the Democratic Republic of the Congo amid the M23 campaign (2022–present).

<doc id="575043" wikidata="Q4798829" url="?curid=575043" title="Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts">
<text>Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts (also known as Talent Scouts) was an American radio and television variety show which ran on CBS from 1946 until 1958. Sponsored by Lipton Tea, it starred Arthur Godfrey, who was also hosting &quot;Arthur Godfrey and His Friends&quot; at the same time.

==Overview==
The concept for the show was that Godfrey had several &quot;talent scouts&quot; who brought their discoveries onto the program to showcase their talents. The winner of each show was determined by a meter that judged the audience&#x27;s applause. The radio series began July 2, 1946, and was heard on CBS Tuesday evenings at 9pm. The winner on October 1, 1946, was pianist José Melis, who later became a familiar late night television personality as the orchestra leader on Jack Paar&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&quot; show.

In the summer of 1947, &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; moved to Fridays at 9:30 p.m. After August 1947 it aired on Mondays at 8:30 p.m. The radio show continued until October 1, 1956. With Archie Bleyer leading the orchestra, the show&#x27;s announcer was George Bryan. The show&#x27;s opening (to the tune of &quot;Four and Twenty Blackbirds&quot;) featured Peggy Marshall and the Holidays singing:
:Here comes Arthur Godfrey
:Your talent scout emcee
:Brought to you by Lipton
:Brisk Lipton Tea
:You know it&#x27;s Lipton Tea
:If it&#x27;s B-R-I-S-K
:You know it&#x27;s Arthur Godfrey
:When you hear them play ...

At that point, the music would segue into trombonist Lou McGarity and the orchestra playing Godfrey&#x27;s familiar theme song, &quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot;, sometimes with Godfrey singing or humming along.

Contestants on the show included Pat Boone, The Chordettes, The McGuire Sisters and Carmel Quinn, all of whom went on to perform on &quot;Arthur Godfrey and His Friends&quot;. Other contestants included Tony Bennett, The Blackwood Brothers, Lenny Bruce, Laurie Carroll, Roy Clark, Rosemary Clooney, Ken Berry, Florian ZaBach, Wally Cox, Vic Damone, The Diamonds, Eddie Fisher, Connie Francis, Don Knotts, Steve Lawrence, Al Martino, Barbara McNair, Marian McPartland, Johnny Nash, Leslie Uggams, Lorraine Donahue (who later appeared on &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot;), Joe Negri, Roger Williams (pianist), and Jonathan Winters. Swedish singer Kjerstin Dellert won a contest in 1948 with &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;, beginning her career as a vocalist there. Patsy Cline first gained national attention with a winning performance of &quot;Walkin&#x27; After Midnight&quot; on the January 21, 1957, broadcast. Among those who auditioned but were not chosen to appear on the broadcast were Buddy Holly, The Four Freshmen, and Elvis Presley.

==Television==
On television, &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; premiered December 6, 1948. According to the Nielsen ratings, it was the highest rated television show for the 1951–1952 season. It remained a highly popular show through the decade. The show took a great drop in ratings after orchestra bandleader Archie Bleyer left in the 1954–1955 season, but rebounded as the scouts continued to discover more talent. However, by the fall of 1957, television audiences began to prefer westerns and adventure shows to quiz programs and Godfrey&#x27;s ratings dropped out of the top 30 Nielsen Chart. The show aired its final episode on January 1, 1958.

On December 24, 1956, the show became the first entertainment program to be videotaped for broadcast, as the then-new technology was used for a time-delayed rebroadcast in the Pacific Time Zone. An Ampex quadruplex videotape machine recorded the initial live broadcast to the Eastern part of the country, which was replayed three hours later. As with his radio programs, CBS allowed Godfrey to periodically host the show remotely from his Virginia farm while the rest of the cast and guests performed in New York.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; aired Monday at 8:30-9:00 PM on CBS its entire run.

<text>AC Transit (Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District) is an Oakland-based public transit agency serving the western portions of Alameda and Contra Costa counties in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area. AC Transit also operates &quot;Transbay&quot; routes across San Francisco Bay to San Francisco and selected areas in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. AC Transit is constituted as a special district under California law. It is governed by seven elected members (five from geographic wards and two at large). It is not a part of or under the control of Alameda or Contra Costa counties or any local jurisdictions.

Buses operate out of four operating divisions: Emeryville, East Oakland (Seminary), Hayward, and Richmond. The Operations Control Center is in Emeryville. The Richmond operating division closed in 2011, but opened again in early 2017 due to a revived economy. The District is the public successor to the privately owned Key System.

In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

==Service area==
The AC Transit District is the third-largest public bus system in California, serving a number of cities and unincorporated areas in Alameda and Contra Costa counties. These include Alameda, Albany, Ashland, Berkeley, Castro Valley, Cherryland, East Richmond Heights, El Cerrito, El Sobrante, Emeryville, Fairview, Fremont, Hayward, Kensington, Newark, North Richmond, Oakland, Piedmont, Richmond, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, and San Pablo. Some AC Transit bus routes also serve other areas in the Bay Area, such as Contra Costa Centre, Dublin, Milpitas, Palo Alto, Pinole, Pittsburg, San Francisco, Stanford, and Union City.

AC Transit provides service to many colleges and universities, including Berkeley City College, California State University, East Bay, Chabot College, College of Alameda, Contra Costa College, Holy Names University, Laney College, Merritt College, Mills College at Northeastern University, Northwestern Polytechnic University, Ohlone College, Stanford University, and University of California, Berkeley.

Most AC Transit routes connect with rapid transit services, such as BART, with one route connecting to the VTA Orange Line light rail service at the Milpitas Transit Center. Some routes also connect with commuter rail and regional rail services, including the ACE commuter rail service at the Fremont–Centerville station and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot;, &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, and &quot;San Joaquins&quot; services. AC Transit routes also connect with several other bus systems in the Bay Area, such as the Dumbarton Express, Emery Go-Round, FAST, Golden Gate Transit, MUNI, SamTrans, SolTrans, Union City Transit, VTA, and WestCAT bus systems. AC Transit also connects with the San Francisco Bay Ferry system at several ferry slips, including the Alameda Harbor Bay Ferry Slip, the Alameda Seaplane Lagoon Ferry Slip, the Oakland Ferry Slip, and the Richmond Ferry Slip.

While most AC Transit service consists of local lines that operate within the East Bay District, the District also provides Transbay lines. Most of these run across the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge during rush hours only, connecting commuters with San Francisco&#x27;s Salesforce Transit Center. Three routes run across the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge on a daily basis, connecting passengers in Alameda, Berkeley, Emeryville, and Oakland with the Salesforce Transit Center. A late night-only bus operates overnight as a Transbay Replacement for BART service when BART is not running, connecting Albany, Berkeley, El Cerrito, Oakland, and Richmond with San Francisco&#x27;s Central Business District along Market Street, as well as the Inner Mission and SoMa neighborhoods. Several &quot;Early Bird&quot; Transbay Lines run only on early weekday mornings to substitute for early morning BART rail service while BART is undergoing construction, connecting commuters in Contra Costa Centre, Dublin, Fremont, Oakland, Pittsburg, and San Leandro with the Salesforce Transit Center. Lastly, one Transbay Bus service is provided during rush hours only across the Dumbarton Bridge between the Fremont BART station and the Stanford Oval at Stanford University, connecting commuters in Fremont with Palo Alto and Stanford.

===Hubs===

AC Transit&#x27;s primary hubs include BART stations, major shopping centers, and points of interest, which are spread throughout the East Bay. Most routes serve and/or terminate at BART stations. The hubs include:

===Routes===

Much of AC transit&#x27;s ridership is skewed heavily towards a few heavily trafficked local (as opposed to trans-bay) routes. As of 2013, the top five routes account for a third of all riders, and the top twelve routes account for more than half.

==History==
Voters created the Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit) in 1956 and subsequently approved a $16.5 million bond issue in 1959 enabling the District to buy out the failing privately owned Key System Transit Lines. In October 1960, AC Transit&#x27;s service began. The new District built up the bus fleet with 250 new “transit liner” buses, extended service into new neighborhoods, created an intercity express bus network, and increased Bay Bridge bus service.

Numerous AC Transit routes were modified in 1972–73 to serve the new BART system. AC Transit began operating express service connecting BART terminals with outer suburban points under contract to BART on December 2, 1974. With BART operating, suburban municipalities began contracting with AC Transit to operate local bus service. Service began in Fremont on November 12, 1974; in Newark on December 16, 1974; in Concord on September 8, 1975; in Pleasant Hill on December 8, 1975; in Moraga and Orinda on September 13, 1976; and in Antioch and Pittsburg (as Tri Delta Transit under contract to the Eastern Contra Costa Transit Authority) on June 5, 1977. The lines in central Contra Costa County (County Connection) were transferred to the new Central Contra Costa Transit Authority in June 1982. Tri-Delta Transit switched to a different operator in 1984.

In 2003, the District introduced a San Mateo-Hayward Bridge route. Designated as Line M, the service connected the BART stations of Castro Valley and Hayward with Foster City and San Mateo&#x27;s Hillsdale Caltrain station. A second San Mateo-Hayward Bridge route, Line MA, was added in 2006 and discontinued in 2007. (The M replaced the SamTrans 90E, which had been canceled in 1999.) In 2004, the District began service on Line U across the Dumbarton Bridge, connecting Stanford University with ACE and BART trains in Fremont. As part of a consortium of transit agencies (including AC Transit, BART, SamTrans, Union City Transit, and VTA), the District already operated Dumbarton Express bus service across the Dumbarton Bridge.

On June 30, 2003, a new &quot;rapid bus&quot; line operating on San Pablo Avenue was introduced. Designated as Line 72R (or San Pablo Rapid), the service connected Oakland with Richmond and operated at faster speeds than regular local service due to wide stop spacing and signal priority treatments.

Beginning December 10, 2005, AC Transit began participating in the regional All Nighter network, providing 24-hour bus service throughout its service area to supplement BART service, which does not operate during owl hours. AC Transit had provided 24-hour service on many of its trunk lines prior to this date, except in the late 1990s due to budget limitations.

On December 13, 2013, AC Transit adopted a new fare policy that brought changes to the transit system July 2014, including a new day pass that is in line with other transit agencies including VTA and SamTrans. The policy is also designed to speed boarding and help keep buses on schedule, provide greater convenience and value for customers, and encourage more customers to switch to Clipper

==Rapid Bus and Bus Rapid Transit==


A rapid bus line was introduced on San Pablo Avenue on June 30, 2003. Designated as Line 72R (or San Pablo Rapid), it operates from 6 am to 7 pm at 12-minute intervals on weekdays, and 7 am to 7 pm at 15-minute intervals on weekends and holidays. Bus stops are spaced 2/3-mile apart on average, running between Jack London Square (via 20th Street and Broadway) in Oakland and Contra Costa College in San Pablo, and buses receive signal priority at several intersections. Although the line does have scheduled timepoints en route, most buses typically travel along the route as fast (or as slow) as traffic allows.

On June 24, 2007, the success of line 72R made it a model for another rapid bus line that was introduced. Line 1R (or International Rapid) operated on weekdays between Berkeley Way and Oxford Street in Berkeley and Bay Fair BART station in San Leandro, mainly along Telegraph Avenue, International Boulevard, and East 14th Street. Weekend and holiday service operated between Downtown Oakland and San Leandro only.

Line 1R was discontinued on June 26, 2016. On August 9, 2020, the 1R was largely replaced by &quot;Tempo&quot;, AC Transit&#x27;s new &quot;Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)&quot; route. Tempo operates between the Uptown Transit Center and the San Leandro BART station via International Boulevard and East 14th Street. It features 46 brand new platform stations (curbside and center-median) with dedicated bus lanes along the majority of the route. The Telegraph Avenue alignment of the 1R between the Uptown Transit Center and U.C. Berkeley is currently being served by local route 6.

==Bus fleet==
At its inception, AC Transit purchased the mixed White, Mack, and GM &quot;old-look&quot; bus fleet from its predecessor, the Key System. The ex-Key System buses were repainted in &quot;clownface&quot; livery, featuring a predominantly white (upper half) and orange (lower front) color scheme with teal side stripes, and AC Transit adopted a &quot;wing&quot; logo featuring the same colors. After its inception, the first new AC Transit orders were for GM New Look buses, which the agency advertised as &quot;Transit Liners&quot;. AC Transit began New Look operation in late 1960. AC Transit would continue to operate a mixed fleet of buses throughout the 1960s.
AC Transit also pioneered the use of articulated buses in the United States; in March 1966 it was the first transit agency to use the Super Golden Eagle long-distance coach (originally designed and built for Continental Trailways; AC Transit designated it XMC-77 and called it the &quot;Freeway Train&quot;), primarily on Transbay service. By 1970, AC Transit was one of six agencies to participate in a &quot;super bus project&quot; coordinated by the National Transportation Center (Pittsburgh) to write a specification for a higher-capacity bus; once the specification had been written, two prototypes would be built and tested to select a winner for a large group procurement of 100 buses to keep per-unit costs low. Two European-built articulated buses were tested in the summer of 1974: a Volvo B58, and a . Riders received the M.A.N. bus favorably, and the specification was released for bid in 1975; AC Transit placed an order for 30 buses in 1976 and deliveries began from the AM General/M.A.N. joint venture in 1978.

For its rigid buses, AC Transit continued purchasing GM New Look buses through the early 1970s, then switched to purchasing Flxible New Look buses starting in 1974. Since the early 1980s, AC Transit began acquiring buses from Flyer, Neoplan, and Gillig. Around this time, AC Transit began ordering new buses in a &quot;stripe&quot; color scheme, featuring the same orange, teal, and white colors as the previous &quot;clownface&quot; livery. In the late 1990s, AC Transit added buses from NABI. AC Transit supplemented these buses with a fleet of 45-foot over-the-road coaches purchased from Motor Coach Industries beginning in the early 2000s.
In 2003, AC Transit began purchasing low-floor buses from Van Hool. The Van Hool buses were assembled in Belgium and featured low floors and three doors (four doors on articulated models), which AC Transit touted as the key to bus rapid transit service between Berkeley and San Leandro along Shattuck, Telegraph, International Blvd, and East 14th Street. At the same time, AC Transit rolled out a revised &quot;ribbon&quot; livery featuring new colors (green and black), and a new logo. The logo was simplified in 2014.

After criticism over the use of federal funds to purchase foreign-made Van Hool buses and the tailoring of specification requirements to exclude domestic manufacturers, AC Transit ordered locally-built Gillig buses in 2012. In March 2013, AC Transit began operating the first of its new Gillig buses. In August of the same year, AC Transit placed the first of its new New Flyer Xcelsior articulated buses into service. Later that year, in November 2013, new Gillig buses with a suburban seating configuration and Transbay branding were introduced into service.

All AC Transit buses are wheelchair accessible and have front-mounted bicycle racks. The MCI buses also feature luggage bay bicycle racks. AC Transit buses purchased after 2007 have air conditioning, as approved by the board of directors.

===Alternative power===

In 1969, AC Transit received a grant and converted bus #666 to steam power, which ran in revenue service between 1971 and 1972. The propulsion system was designed by William Brobeck and used a triple-expansion reciprocating steam engine; power was improved compared to the original six-cylinder Detroit Diesel 6V71 engine and emissions were reduced, but fuel consumption was higher than the conventional diesel bus. The steam system is a closed loop. Exhaust steam is condensed and returned to the steam generator, which is an externally-fired boiler that uses of coiled steel tubing. Prior to entering service, the steam bus was exhibited in Washington DC and to the public. Bus #666 completed in revenue service when the trial ended in September 1972, and the diesel engine was subsequently reinstalled in the bus.

AC Transit is the lead agency of Zero Emission Bay Area (ZEBA), a consortium of five Bay Area transit agencies (AC Transit, Golden Gate Transit, SFMTA, SamTrans, and VTA) demonstrating fuel cell buses. The District began the HyRoad program in 1999 and tested several fuel cell buses with new hydrogen fuelling infrastructure, including the Ballard/XCELLSiS ZEbus (a New Flyer F40LF with a Ballard fuel cell) in November 1999. Three hydrogen-powered buses, based on the Van Hool A330, operated in revenue service from 2006 to 2010. AC Transit took delivery of 12 additional third-generation fuel cell buses, based on the Van Hool A300L in 2011. In 2019, AC Transit began operating 11 additional hydrogen fuel cell buses from New Flyer, one of which is a 60-foot articulated bus, and 5 battery electric buses from New Flyer.

==Funding==
AC Transit is funded with a mix of federal, state, and local government subsidies, as well as passenger fares.

In March 2004, voters throughout the San Francisco Bay Area approved Regional Measure 2, which funds regional transportation capital and operating programs through a US$1.00 surcharge on State-owned bridges operated by the BATA. (The Golden Gate Bridge is owned and operated by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District.)

In November 2004, voters approved Measure BB, which increased the parcel tax from US$24 to US$48 annually for 10 years beginning 1 July 2005, to help fund AC Transit services.

In April 2005, a federal class-action lawsuit was filed against the Metropolitan Transportation Commission alleging that it discriminates against AC Transit&#x27;s primarily minority riders by giving AC Transit disproportionately less money than BART and Caltrain. AC Transit is not party to the lawsuit, and the court sided with MTC in 2009.

In November 2008, voters approved Measure VV, which increased the parcel tax by US$48 annually for 10 years beginning 1 July 2009, to help fund AC Transit services. Measure VV also extended the US$48 parcel tax approved under Measure BB so a total US$96 annual tax is effective through 30 June 2019.

==Internet access==
AC Transit also offers wireless internet on many buses that serve Transbay lines. These buses can be distinguished by their all-green livery, padded &quot;commuter&quot; seats, and Wi-Fi logos near the front entrance door and inside the bus.

<text>The [[bamboo]] [[flute]], especially the bone flute, is one of the oldest musical instruments known. Examples of Paleolithic bone flutes have survived for more than 40,000 years, to be discovered by archaeologists. While the oldest flutes currently known were found in Europe, Asia too has a long history with the instrument that has continued into the present day. In China, a playable bone flute was discovered, about 9000 years old.

Historians have found the bamboo flute has a long history as well, especially China and India. Flutes made history in records and artworks starting in the Zhou dynasty. The oldest written sources reveal the Chinese were using the kuan (a reed instrument) and hsio (or xiao, an end-blown flute, often of bamboo) in the 12th-11th centuries b.c., followed by the chi (or ch&#x27;ih) in the 9th century b.c. and the yüeh in the 8th century b.c. Of these, the chi is the oldest documented cross flute or transverse flute, and was made from bamboo. The Chinese have a word, &quot;zhudi&quot;, which literally means &quot;bamboo flute.&quot;

The cross flute (Sanscrit: vāṃśī) was &quot;the outstanding wind instrument of ancient India,&quot; according to Curt Sachs. He said that religious artwork depicting &quot;celestial music&quot; instruments was linked to music with an &quot;aristocratic character.&quot; The Indian bamboo cross flute, Bansuri, was sacred to Krishna, and he is depicted in Hindu art with the instrument. In India, the cross flute appeared in reliefs from the 1st century a.d. at Sanchi and Amaravati from the 2nd-4th centuries a.d.

In the modern age, bamboo flutes are common in places with ready access to bamboo, including Asia, South and Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa.

==End blown flute mouthpieces==
==List of bamboo flutes, cane flutes, reed flutes==
This list is intended to show flutes made of bamboo. It excludes pan flutes or panpipes, and flutes and whistles that don&#x27;t have finger positions to change notes. It also excludes pipes that use reeds to produce the sound. Bamboo is a grass, and some &quot;cane&quot; or &quot;reed&quot; flutes may get listed here, as long as the plant is being used for a tube that is blown into or across to create noise. Types of flutes include transverse flutes (also called cross flutes), end-blown flutes (ring flutes are included with these) and Nose flutes. Fipple flutes, also called duct flutes, may be added to the list as well, as long as they are bamboo-based instruments. The bamboo variant may be added for instruments that include wood and bamboo versions.

<doc id="575052" wikidata="Q223240" url="?curid=575052" title="Capital One Arena">
<text>Capital One Arena is an indoor arena in Washington, D.C. Located in the Chinatown section of the larger Penn Quarter neighborhood, the arena sits atop the Gallery Place rapid transit station of the Washington Metro. The arena was opened on December 2, 1997, as MCI Center but renamed to Verizon Center in 2006 when MCI was acquired by Verizon Communications and changed again to its current name in 2017.

Owned and operated by Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, it is the home arena of the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the Georgetown University men&#x27;s basketball team. It was also home to the Washington Mystics of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 1998 to 2018, after which they moved to the CareFirst Arena in southeast Washington for the 2019 season. The arena project was a commercial success for its backers.

The development of the arena has contributed to the gentrification of the surrounding area, the displacement of most of its Asian-American residents (the local Chinese-American population, which numbered over 3,000 before the arena&#x27;s construction, was a mere 300 in 2023), and the replacement of most of the small businesses and restaurants that served the Asian-American community by national chains.

==History==
The block where the arena was built, between 6th and 7th and F and G Streets, historically held a mix of residences and small businesses. By the 1960s, it was suffering from urban decay, like much of the eastern end of Downtown Washington. In 1973, while the Gallery Place Metro station was being developed below it, the District government bought the land in hopes of redeveloping it. Capital Landmark Associates was selected in 1979 to develop the site with a planned mixed-use complex including retail, offices, apartments, and a hotel. Most of the remaining buildings on the site were demolished in 1985. The project languished for many years but never materialized, and was finally canceled in 1992.

Before the arena&#x27;s opening, the Capitals and the Wizards (then known as the Washington Bullets) played at USAir Arena in the Washington suburb of Landover, Maryland. The teams experienced subpar attendance because the location was inconvenient for both Washington and Baltimore residents, and their arena, though only 20 years old, was not up to the standards of other NBA and NHL venues. In December 1993, Abe Pollin, the owner of both teams, began studying options to move the teams to a new arena to be built with public financing, with possible locations including Baltimore, downtown Washington, and Laurel, Maryland.

A group of Washington business leaders brokered a deal between Pollin and the District government to build an arena at the Gallery Place site, with the District paying for the $150 million project, which was envisioned to have shopping, food, and exhibitors for daily use even when there was no arena event. The D.C. Council approved a special tax on businesses to finance the deal. However, a competing proposal soon emerged, when Robert Johnson, head of Black Entertainment Television, offered to build the arena with mostly private financing. With the arena deal facing criticism amid the District&#x27;s budget crisis, Pollin eventually agreed to privately fund the construction of the building, which ultimately came to $200 million (US$ in dollars). The District would pay for other costs, including purchasing the portion of the land it did not already own, preparing the site, and expanding the Metro station; these eventually amounted to $79 million (US$ in dollars). The District leased the land to Pollin at a below-market rate of $300,000 per year.

A naming rights deal was struck with MCI Communications to name the arena as the MCI Center. The groundbreaking ceremony for the project was held in October 1995. On December 2, 1997, the arena held its first event, a game between the Wizards and the Seattle SuperSonics, with President Bill Clinton in attendance. The arena had a Discovery Channel Store from 1998 to 2001 and the MCI National Sports Gallery, an interactive sports museum with interactive games, memorabilia, and the American Sportscasters Hall of Fame inside from 1998 to 2000 or 2001 which was repurposed for office space. Clinton toured the gallery before the game, playing the museum games. A block of F Street NW between 6th and 7th Street NW outside the arena was declared Fun Street, complete with signage. This block later was declared Abe Pollin Way in 2007. The arena was noted for building spectator seats vertically rather than out, creating better views for all attending albeit with limited leg room in the upper levels, as well as spacious quarters for players and coaches with advanced competitive research technology. The arena concourse featured multimedia arenaNet stations where fans could check scores, watch highlights, and send digital postcards over email. These replaced an abandoned idea to have smart seats with televisions and technology that was scrapped due to technological challenges. Arena technology was powered by a virtual LAN software and switching technology called ArenaNET from Cabletron Systems.

In 1999, a group led by technology executive Ted Leonsis bought a 36% stake in Pollin&#x27;s holdings, including the MCI Center, as well as full ownership of the Capitals. The Leonsis group increased its stake to 44% in 2000.
In January 2006, Verizon Communications purchased MCI and the arena&#x27;s name was changed accordingly to Verizon Center. VIDA Fitness opened its first location in the arena that same year. The following year, in 2007, the &quot;first true indoor high-definition LED scoreboard&quot; was installed in the arena. In May 2024, VIDA Fitness announced that they would close their Gallery Place location. Gallery Place, a 14-screen movie theater, opened at Capital One Arena in 2004.

In June 2010, following Pollin&#x27;s death in November 2009, the Leonsis group, newly organized as Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, bought out Pollin&#x27;s interests, gaining full ownership of the arena and the Wizards.

A report emerged in May 2015 that Verizon would not renew its naming rights to the Verizon Center when its agreement with Monumental was to end in 2018. In the same week, it was announced that Etihad Airways signed a deal to become the official airline of the arena, sparking speculation that Etihad might be the leading contender to assume naming rights in 2017. However, on August 9, 2017, it was announced that the bank Capital One had purchased the rights, renaming the venue Capital One Arena. In October 2024, it was revealed that Etihad Airways is no longer the official airline for Capital One Arena as United Airlines (which operates a hub at Dulles International Airport) was chosen as the new official airline.
In 2019 and 2020, Monumental Sports undertook a $30 million renovation of the stadium. This included completely replacing the arena&#x27;s seating, improving the concourse, and altering many of the arena&#x27;s dining options. A new, larger overhead video board was also added as well as a new SkyRing video screen that goes around the top of the arena.

In July 2020, bookmaker William Hill opened a sportsbook at the arena, following the 2018 legalization of sports betting in Washington. It was the first brick-and-mortar sportsbook in the District, and the first to open at a professional sports venue in the United States.

On June 23, 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Monumental Sports was considering moving the Capitals and Wizards to a new arena in the National Landing area of Arlington in Northern Virginia if the Washington, D.C. government did not invest in upgrades to the arena and surrounding area. Despite this, the article outlined that the city intended on continuing its dialogue with the company to keep both teams in Capital One Arena. Monumental later pivoted to a part of the National Landing area lying in a different Northern Virginia jurisdiction, announcing on December 13, 2023, that it planned to build the new arena in the Potomac Yard area of Alexandria. Under the revised plan, Capital One Arena would have remained in use as a concert and event venue during the NBA and NHL seasons, and also become the permanent home of Monumental&#x27;s Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) team, the Washington Mystics. In March 2024, after officials in Alexandria announced that the $2 billion entertainment and sports complex plans were scrapped, Washington, D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser announced that she had signed a deal with both teams&#x27; majority owner, Ted Leonsis, to keep the Capitals and Wizards in the District &quot;at least until 2050.&quot; The deal will see a massive renovation to the arena which will be completed by 2028 in six phases, changing the exterior and interior that will include new technology and improved fan experiences.

Capital One Arena is in the early stages of a multi-year $850 million renovation that will completely alter the exterior and parts of the interior of the arena. $515 million is coming from the District of Columbia government, while the rest is being paid for by Monumental Sports and Entertainment, which owns the teams. The renovation is expected to be completed in time for the start of the 2027-2028 NHL and NBA seasons.

The indoor parade of the second inauguration of Donald Trump took place in the arena on January 20, 2025.

==Sports==

===Ice hockey===

The arena has been home to the Capitals NHL team since its opening. As a result, numerous memorable moments in franchise history have occurred in the arena. The arena hosted games three and four of the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, when the Capitals lost to the Detroit Red Wings in four games. The Red Wings hoisted the namesake Stanley Cup in the arena on June 16, 1998, after winning game four by a score of 4–1. On April 5, 2008, the Capitals won the Southeast Division in the last game of the regular season, after beating the Florida Panthers 3–1. Game 2 of the 2009 Eastern Conference semifinals between the Capitals and the Pittsburgh Penguins, played on May 4, 2009, saw dueling hat tricks from Ovechkin and rival Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins, culminating in a 4–3 victory for Washington thanks to an additional goal from David Steckel. The arena also hosted games three and four of the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals. The Capitals won both games and then went on to win game five in Las Vegas to capture the Stanley Cup for the first major sports championship for a Washington, D.C. team since the 1991 Washington Redskins. The Capitals had their Stanley Cup banner installation ceremony in the arena before their first game of the next season, which took place on October 3, 2018.

===Basketball===

The arena has been home to the Wizards NBA team since its opening and was home to the Washington Mystics WNBA team from 1998 to 2018, before the Mystics moved to a new, smaller arena in the Congress Heights area of southeast Washington. In 2024, the Mystics relocated their June 7 and September 19 games against the Indiana Fever to Capital One Arena, citing the demand of tickets as a result of the rising popularity of Caitlin Clark. The Georgetown Hoyas men&#x27;s basketball team has also played there since the arena&#x27;s opening. The arena has hosted three basketball all star games: the 2001 NBA All-Star Game and the 2002 and 2007 WNBA All-Star Games. The arena has been home to many playoff games, but has yet to host an NBA Finals.

The arena has hosted games for the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament several times. It hosted first- and second-round games in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2011, and hosted the regional finals in 2006, 2013 and 2019. Most notably the 2005–06 George Mason Patriots men&#x27;s basketball team from nearby Fairfax, Virginia advanced to the Final Four in the arena.

The Washington International Horse Show took place every October in the arena for more than 20 years through 2019, after which it was moved out because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The arena served as the venue for U.S. president Donald Trump&#x27;s inaugural parade on January 20, 2025. The day before, Trump held a rally in the arena.

=== Professional wrestling ===
The arena has hosted various professional wrestling events; it hosted the final four editions of WCW&#x27;s Starrcade pay-per-view, followed by WWE&#x27;s Backlash in 2000, SummerSlam in 2005, Cyber Sunday in 2007, Survivor Series in 2009, Capitol Punishment in 2011, and Battleground in 2016. The arena frequently hosts &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; shows as well. 

On October 2, 2019, Capital One Arena hosted the series premiere of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, the first weekly television series of All Elite Wrestling (AEW).

== Criticism ==

=== Gentrification ===
When the arena opened, there was concern that it would lead to the displacement of Chinese businesses and culture in the area that is the city&#x27;s Chinatown. The surrounding area has indeed been dramatically gentrified, and most of the Chinese residents and businesses who lived and operated in the neighborhood when the arena first opened have been displaced because of the spike in real estate prices. 2011 estimates hold that the number of Chinese in the neighborhood is down to around 400 to 500. The Chinese-owned restaurants and businesses in the Chinatown area are largely gone and there has not been a full-service Chinese grocery in the neighborhood since 2005.

A similar stadium project proposed for Philadelphia&#x27;s Chinatown sparked comparisons in 2023 to the Capital One Arena, and has caused significant community backlash.

=== Ice quality issues===
In December 2007, then-Capitals captain Chris Clark stated that he believed the arena had the worst ice in the NHL. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of ruts in the ice. It&#x27;s soft. It&#x27;s wet half the time. I could see a lot of injuries coming from the ice there. It could cost [players] their jobs... Even guys on other teams say the same thing. When we&#x27;re facing off, they say, &#x27;How do you guys play on this?&#x27;&quot; Capitals owner Ted Leonsis addressed this criticism directly. The ice quality issue has been persistent both since the opening of the facility and with the Capitals franchise in general. Since Leonsis&#x27; acquisition of the facility, the quality of the ice has improved and number of complaints has noticeably decreased. During playoff games, the arena installs additional portable refrigeration units outside the arena to aid the ice conditions during the warm and humid summer months.

<text>An inverted river delta is a river delta in which the narrow end of the delta emerges on the seafront and the wide end is located further inland, so that with respect to the seafront, the locations of both ends of the delta are inverted.

== Explanation ==
River deltas typically form on flat, coastal floodplains: the narrow end located at the point where a river fans out and deposits sediment in a region extending outward into the body of water which the river empties. In the case of an inverted delta, the delta is located at the waterway&#x27;s exit from a large, flat valley, yet still inside the valley. The sediment is dropped within the valley and the clear water then exits into a bay or the ocean, so the apex of the delta is at this exit, a configuration said to be inverted from that usually seen. Inverted deltas typically do not last long in geological terms, since they tend to fill up with sediments rather quickly and eventually become normal deltas.

== Examples ==
===The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta===
A classic example of an inverted river delta is the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, which lies at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers in California. The water from the rivers that drain the entire, large California Central Valley exit through the Carquinez Strait, a narrow gap in the Coast Range. An inverted river delta exists behind this strait.

===The Tagus River===

Another example is the delta of the Tagus river in Portugal, although due to sedimentation this delta is now only very partially inverted, with the valley now mostly filled with sediment. It is still about wide and long, compared with the exit into the sea, and forms a large lagoon with large and very shallow sand banks which are uncovered during low tides. The delta used to be even bigger thousands of years ago.

<doc id="575059" wikidata="Q193007" url="?curid=575059" title="Sukhoi">
<text>The JSC Sukhoi Company (, ) is a Russian aircraft manufacturer (formerly Soviet), headquartered in Begovoy District, Northern Administrative Okrug, Moscow, that designs both civilian and military aircraft. It was founded in the Soviet Union by Pavel Sukhoi in 1939 as the Sukhoi Design Bureau (OKB-51, design office prefix Su). During February 2006, the Russian government merged Sukhoi with Mikoyan, Ilyushin, Irkut, Tupolev, and Yakovlev as a new company named United Aircraft Corporation.

==History==
=== Origins ===
In March 1930, nine years prior to the creation of the bureau, Pavel Sukhoi, an aerospace engineer, took over team no. 4 of the CAHI&#x27;s AGOS aviation, flying boat aviation and aircraft prototype engineering facility. Under Sukhoi&#x27;s leadership, the team of the future design bureau started to take shape. The team, under the Tupolev OKB, produced experimental fighters such as the I-3, I-14, and the DIP, a record-breaking RD aircraft, the Tupolev ANT-25, flown by famous Soviet aviators, Valery Chkalov and Mikhail Gromov, and the long-range bombers such as the Tupolev TB-1 and the Tupolev TB-3.

In 1936, Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, issued a requirement for a multi-role combat aircraft. As a result, Sukhoi and his team developed the BB-1, a reconnaissance aircraft and light bomber in 1937. The BB-1 was approved and under a July 29, 1939 government resolution, the Sukhoi OKB, designated as OKB-51, also known as the Sukhoi Design Bureau, was developed in order to set up production for the aircraft. The BB-1 was introduced and later adopted by the Soviet Air Forces in the same year. A year later, the BB-1 was later designated the Sukhoi Su-2. A total of 910 Su-2 aircraft were built. The resolution also made Sukhoi chief designer, gave Sukhoi&#x27;s team of the design bureau standalone status and relocation of the bureau to the Production Aircraft Plant No. 135 in Kharkov, Ukrainian SSR. However, Sukhoi was not satisfied with its location, since it was isolated from the scientific pole of Moscow. Sukhoi later relocated the bureau to the aerodrome of Podmoskovye in Moscow, completing half of the relocation by 1940. Sukhoi encountered another issue: the bureau had no production line in Moscow, thus making it useless as Sukhoi had nothing to do.

=== World War II ===
During the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II, the Su-2 needed a successor as it was proved obsolete and under-armed against German aircraft, with 222 aircraft destroyed in total. Sukhoi and his bureau designed a two-seat armored ground-attack aircraft, the Sukhoi Su-6, considered in some terms to be superior to its competitor, the Ilyushin Il-2. The government, however later chose the Il-2 over the Su-6, but rewarded Sukhoi a Stalin Prize of the 1st Level for its development in 1943. Sukhoi and this team later focused on development of variants of the Su-2, the prototype cannon-armed Sukhoi Su-1 (Su-3) fighter, as well as the Sukhoi Su-8, which to serve as a long-range ground-attack aircraft for the Soviet Air Forces, but was later discarded as the Soviet Union was winning the Eastern Front.

=== Cold War ===

After the war, Sukhoi and his team were among the first Soviet aircraft designers who led the work on jet aircraft, creating several experimental jet fighters. Sukhoi started developing two mixed-power fighters, the Sukhoi Su-5 and a modification of the Sukhoi Su-6 named Su-7 before 1945. At the start of 1945, the design bureau started working on jet fighters such as the Sukhoi Su-9, Sukhoi Su-11, Sukhoi Su-15, and the Sukhoi Su-17, the Sukhoi Su-10 jet bomber, and the reconnaissance and artillery spotter twinjet, the Sukhoi Su-12. Sukhoi and his team also used the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber to develop and produce the trainer bomber UTB-2, worked on passenger and troop-carrying aircraft, the jet fighter Sukhoi Su-14, and a number of other aircraft.

From 1945 to 1950, Sukhoi and his team also developed the Soviet Union&#x27;s first booster aircraft control system, landing braking parachute, catapult ejection seat with telescopic trolley, and a jettisonable nose with a pressurized cockpit. From 1949, Sukhoi fell out of Stalin&#x27;s favor and in a government resolution, the Sukhoi Design Bureau was scrapped, and Sukhoi was forced to return to work under Andrei Tupolev, this time as Deputy Chief Designer. In 1953, the year of Stalin&#x27;s death, he was permitted to re-establish his own Sukhoi Design Bureau, set up with new production facilities.

=== Contemporary era ===
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, each of the multitude of bureaus and factories producing Sukhoi components was privatized independently. In the early 1990s, Sukhoi started to diversify its products and initiated Sukhoi Civil Aircraft to create a line of civil aviation projects for the company. The progress made by the new branch would lead to the development of the utility aircraft, the Su-80, and the agricultural aircraft, the Su-38, less than a decade later. In 1996, the government re-gathered the major part of them forming Sukhoi Aviation Military Industrial Combine (Sukhoi AIMC). In parallel, other entities, including Ulan Ude factory, Tbilisi factory, Belarus and Ukraine factories, established alternate transnational Sukhoi Attack Aircraft (planning to produce e.g. Su-25 TM).

The Sukhoi AIMC is composed of the JSC Sukhoi Design Bureau and the JSC Sukhoi Civil Aircraft, located in Moscow, the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association (NAPA), located in Novosibirsk, and the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO), located in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. Sukhoi is headquartered in Moscow. Finmeccanica (since 2017, Leonardo) owns 25% + 1 share of Sukhoi&#x27;s civil division. The Russian government merged Sukhoi with Mikoyan, Ilyushin, Irkut, Tupolev, and Yakovlev as a new company named United Aircraft Corporation in February 2006. Mikoyan and Sukhoi were placed within the same operating unit. In September 2007, Sukhoi launched its first modern commercial regional airliner—the Superjet 100 (SSJ 100), a 78 to 98 seater, built by Sukhoi. It was unveiled at Komsomolsk-on-Amur. The maiden flight was made on May 19, 2008. In March 2008, Sukhoi was selected to design and produce the carbon fiber composite wings for Irkut&#x27;s MC-21&#x27;s airframe. Sukhoi is also working on what is to be Russia&#x27;s fifth-generation stealth fighter, the Sukhoi Su-57. The maiden flight took place on the 29 January 2010.

As of January 2015, Sukhoi is working on a family of the regional airliner: the Sukhoi Superjet 100, such as the jet airliner Superjet 130, which would have a seating capacity of 130 to 145 seats, and to bridge the gap of Russian aircraft between the Superjet Stretch and the Irkut MC-21.

===Integration of the Irkut Corporation===
At the end of November 2018, United Aircraft Corporation transferred from Sukhoi to the Irkut Corporation, to become UAC&#x27;s airliner division, as Leonardo S.p.A. pulled out in early 2017 because of Superjet&#x27;s poor financial performance.
Irkut will manage the Superjet 100, the MC-21 and the Russo-Chinese CR929 widebody, but the Il-114 passenger turboprop and modernized Ilyushin Il-96-400 widebody will stay with Ilyushin.
The new commercial division will also include the Yakovlev Design Bureau, avionics specialist UAC—Integration Center and composite manufacturer AeroComposit.

Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company (SCAC), a developer and manufacturer of SuperJet aircraft, ceased operations as an independent legal entity and became a branch of IRKUT Corporation, changing its name to Regional aircraft. This is stated on the company&#x27;s website.

&quot;Within the implementation of the strategy uniting civil aircraft companies into one Civil Aviation Division JSC “SCA” has been integrated into Irkut Corporation starting from February 17, 2020. The decision was adopted by JSC “SCA” Shareholders on June 27, 2019. Regional Aircraft – Branch of the Irkut Corporation shall resume the continuity of business in the areas of development, production and aftersales support of the aircraft,&quot; - it is stated on corporate website in the section &quot;Company&quot;.

In June 2023 patents for a new design of a single engine Su-75 stealth fighter were filed, given the codename &quot;checkmate&quot; the design work has taken 3 years and test aircraft are under construction.

On 23 February 2024, smoke was seen emerging from a warehouse located on the site of Sukhoi Design Bureau&#x27;s headquarters in Moscow. 
On 14 June 2024, another fire, this time more serious, broke out in a different building at the same site in Moscow, collapsing the roof of the latter. An area of some 800 square meters was destroyed. However officials said that the building wasn&#x27;t in use at the time. Over 70 firefighters and 25 units were used to put out this fire.

<text>The Arthur Murray Party is an American television variety show that ran from July 1950 until September 1960. The show was hosted by dancers Arthur and Kathryn Murray, the show featured various acts and celebrity guests and acted as advertisement for their chain of dance studios. Each week, the couple performed a mystery dance, and the viewer who correctly identified the dance would receive two free lessons at a local studio.

&quot;The Arthur Murray Party&quot; is notable for being one of the few TV series broadcast on all four major commercial networks in the 1950s during the Golden Age of Television.

==Overview==
The show was set up like a large party, with Kathryn hosting a variety of guests, from sports stars to actors or musicians. Murray dance studio instructors would help Kathryn and Arthur to show their guests how to perform a particular dance step. At the end of the show, the couple would perform a Johann Strauss waltz.

The dancers often dressed in elegant clothing, which could cause amusing problems at times. In one surviving episode (February 15, 1954), available on Internet Archive, the well-dressed female dancers are heard squealing with teenage-like excitement at guest star Johnnie Ray. Buddy Holly and The Crickets performed &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; on the December 29, 1957 telecast, also preserved on a kinescope.

The J. Fred and Leslie W. MacDonald Collection at the Library of Congress contains thirteen kinescoped programs and partial programs of the various incarnations of Arthur Murray on TV. These include a complete one-hour show from late 1950 featuring guests The DeMarco Sisters plus Andy and Della Russell; a complete half-hour show from August 17, 1954, featuring guest Don Cornell; a segment from September 27, 1956, in which The Platters perform &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know&quot; and Andy Williams sings &quot;Canadian Sunset&quot;; and a segment from August 5, 1957, in which celebrities Jack E. Leonard, Bert Lahr, Paul Winchell, and June Havoc compete in a dance contest.

Choreographer James Starbuck won an Emmy Award for his work on this program.

<text>Tupolev (), officially United Aircraft Company Tupolev - Public Joint Stock Company, is a Russian aerospace and defence company headquartered in Basmanny District, Moscow.

UAC Tupolev is successor to the Soviet Tupolev Design Bureau (OKB-156, design office prefix &quot;Tu&quot;) founded in 1922 by aerospace pioneer and engineer Andrei Tupolev, who led the company for 50 years until his death in 1972. Tupolev designed over 100 models of civilian and military aircraft and produced more than 18,000 aircraft for Russia, the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc since its founding, and celebrated its 100th anniversary on 22 October 2022. Tupolev is involved in numerous aerospace and defence sectors including development, manufacturing, and overhaul for both civil and military aerospace products such as aircraft and weapons systems, and also missile and naval aviation technologies.

In 2006, Tupolev became a division of the United Aircraft Corporation in a merger with Mikoyan, Ilyushin, Irkut, Sukhoi, and Yakovlev by decree of the Russian President Vladimir Putin.

==History==
=== In the USSR ===

Tupolev OKB was founded by Andrei Tupolev in 1922. Its facilities are tailored for aeronautics research and aircraft design only, manufacturing is handled by other firms. It researched all-metal airplanes during the 1920s, based directly on the pioneering work already done by Hugo Junkers during World War I.



Among the notable results during Tupolev&#x27;s early period were two significant all-metal heavy bombers with corrugated duralumin skins, the ANT-4 twin-engined bomber which first flew in 1925 and the four-engined ANT-6 of 1932, from which such airplanes as the ANT-20 were derived (see Yefim Gordon &amp; Vladimir Rigmant, OKB Tupolev. Hinckley, UK: Midland, 2005. pp. 22–28 &amp; 30–34). Tupolev&#x27;s design approach in these two airplanes defined for many years the trends of heavy aircraft development, civil and military.

During World War II, the twin-engined, all-metal Tu-2 was one of the best front-line bombers of the Soviets. Several variants of it were produced in large numbers from 1942. During the war it used wooden rear fuselages due to a shortage of metal.

This was succeeded by the development of the jet-powered Tu-16 bomber, which used a sweptback wing for good subsonic performance.

As turbojets were not fuel efficient enough to provide truly intercontinental range, the Soviets elected to design a new bomber, the Tu-20, more commonly referred to as the Tu-95. 
It, too, was based on the fuselage and structural design of the Tu-4, but with four colossal Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprop engines providing a unique combination of jet-like speed and long range. It became the definitive Soviet intercontinental bomber, with intercontinental range and jet-like performance. In many respects the Soviet equivalent of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, it served as a strategic bomber and in many alternate roles, including reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare.

The Tu-16 was developed into the civil Tu-104. The Tu-95 became the basis of the unique Tu-114 medium-to-long-range airliner, the fastest turboprop aircraft ever. One common feature found in many large subsonic Tupolev jet aircraft is large pods extending rearward from the trailing edge of the wings, holding the aircraft&#x27;s landing gear. These allow the aircraft to have landing gears made up of many large low-pressure tires, which are invaluable for use on the poor quality runways that were common in the Soviet Union at the time. For example, the Tu-154 airliner, the Soviet equivalent of the Boeing 727, has 14 tyres, the same number as Boeing&#x27;s far larger 777-200.

Even before the first flights of the Tu-16 and Tu-20/Tu-95, Tupolev was working on supersonic bombers, culminating in the unsuccessful Tu-98. Although that aircraft never entered service, it became the basis for the prototype Tu-102 (later developed into the Tu-28 interceptor) and the Tu-105, which evolved into the supersonic Tu-22 bomber in the mid-1960s. Intended as a counterpart to the Convair B-58 Hustler, the Tu-22 proved rather less capable, although it remained in service much longer than the American aircraft. Meanwhile, the &quot;K&quot; Department was formed in the Design Bureau, with the task of designing unmanned aircraft such as the Tu-139 and the Tu-143 unmanned reconnaissance aircraft.

In the 1960s A. N. Tupolev&#x27;s son, A. A. Tupolev, became active with management of the agency. His role included the development of the world&#x27;s first supersonic airliner, the Tu-144, the popular Tu-154 airliner and the Tupolev Tu-22M strategic bomber. All these developments enabled the Soviet Union to achieve strategic military and civil aviation parity with the West.

The Tu-144 proved a disappointment, with crashes in 1973 and 1978 resulting in its withdrawal as a passenger aircraft in 1978. 
In the 1970s, Tupolev concentrated its efforts on improving the performance of the Tu-22M bombers, whose variants included maritime versions. It is the presence of these bombers in quantity that brought about the SALT I and SALT II treaties. Also the efficiency and performance of the Tu-154 was improved, culminating in the efficient Tu-154M.

In the 1980s the design bureau developed the supersonic Tu-160 strategic bomber. Features include variable-geometry wings.

===Post-Soviet Era===
With the end of the Cold War, research work was concentrated on subsonic civil aircraft, mainly on operating economics and alternative fuels. The developments include fly-by-wire, use of efficient high-bypass turbofans and advanced aerodynamic layouts for the 21st century transport aircraft such as the Tu-204/Tu-214, Tu-330 and Tu-334.

Among Tupolev projects from the 1990s to the 2000s:

*further development of Tu-204/214 and TU-334 aircraft family
*development of cargo aircraft Tu-330, regional and executive Tu-324 aircraft
*research on practical aspects of aircraft operation using alternative fuels
*modernization of Russian Naval Aviation and Air Force

At the MAKS-2003 airshow, Tupolev revealed the Tu-444 supersonic business jet concept; development was intended to start in the first half of 2004. However, there has not been any updates on the development, leading to belief that the development may be in question.

In early 2023 United Aircraft Corporation confirmed it would get Tupolev to produce 20 aircraft a year of the TU-214 variant and to develop a freighter version to meet Russia&#x27;s needs.

==Directors==
*Andrei Nikolayevich Tupolev was a leading designer at the Moscow-based Central Aero-Hydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) from 1929 until his death in 1972. This design bureau produced mostly bombers and airliners.
*Alexei Andreyevich Tupolev, son of Andrei Tupolev, was also a famous aircraft designer. His most famous design was the supersonic airliner Tupolev Tu-144. He managed Tupolev until his death in 2001.
* Igor Sergeevich Shevchuk was named the Director of OAO Tupolev in 1997, later the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and in 2001 the President and General Designer. He died unexpectedly in 2011.

<doc id="575079" wikidata="Q1987517" url="?curid=575079" title="B. J. and the Bear">
<text>B. J. and the Bear is an American action comedy television series which aired on NBC from February 10, 1979, to May 9, 1981. Created by Glen A. Larson and Christopher Crowe, the series starred Greg Evigan. The series was produced when the CB radio and trucking craze had peaked in the United States.

The theme song, also titled &quot;B.J. and the Bear&quot;, was written by Larson and performed by Evigan.

==Premise and storylines==
Greg Evigan stars as Billie Joe &quot;B.J.&quot; McKay, a professional freelance itinerant trucker who travels the country&#x27;s highways in a red and white Kenworth K-100 Aerodyne (a COE semi truck) with his pet chimpanzee Bear, named after Bear Bryant, the famed football coach for the University of Alabama. In the pilot movie, it is stated that McKay had spent two years in Vietnam as a medical helicopter pilot, had been a captain and earned the Distinguished Service Cross. He was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam at the Hanoi Hilton for four months in 1973 after his helicopter went down over the DMZ. Episodes typically deal with B.J. uncovering or getting mixed up with crime in the area he is traveling through, and a local resident—usually, a young, beautiful woman—appealing to him for help.

A frequent guest star in the first season is Sheriff Elroy P. Lobo (Claude Akins, who previously starred in the trucking series &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;), whose character eventually spun off onto his own show &quot;The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo&quot; along with guest character &quot;Waverly&quot; Ben Cooper.

Two episodes in season two, &quot;Eyes of Texas&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Girls on the Hollywood High&quot; (1980), were designed as prospective pilots for a series about a pair of private detectives called Heather Fern (Rebecca Reynolds) and Caroline Capodi (Lorrie Mahaffey in the first one, Heather Thomas in the second). The latter episode has cameo appearances from John S. Ragin and Robert Ito as their characters from &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot; (also a Glen A. Larson series).

In 1981, when the show returned for its third season with the two-part episode &quot;B.J. and the Seven Lady Truckers&quot;, B.J. has settled down to run Bear Enterprises, a trucking company based in Los Angeles. His nemesis is Rutherford T. Grant (Murray Hamilton), the corrupt head of the state&#x27;s Special Crimes Action Team, who is a secret partner in a competing trucking company. Because of Grant&#x27;s harassment, B.J. is unable to hire experienced truckers, and is forced to hire seven beautiful young female truckers, consisting of Grant&#x27;s daughter Cindy (Sherilyn Wolter), twins Teri and Geri (Candi and Randi Brough), no-nonsense Angie (Sheila Wills), Samantha (Amanda Horan Kennedy), Callie (Linda McCullough), and a busty blonde nicknamed &quot;Stacks&quot; (Judy Landers), along with a female dispatcher, Stacy (Susan Woollen).

Though Universal has never released &quot;B. J. and the Bear&quot; on home video, bootleg editions are available on DVD.

<text>Baretta is an American detective television series which ran on ABC from 1975 to 1978.

The show was a revised and milder version of a 1973–1974 ABC series, &quot;Toma&quot;, starring Tony Musante as chameleon-like, real-life New Jersey police officer David Toma. When Musante left the series after a single season, the concept was retooled as &quot;Baretta&quot;, with Robert Blake in the title role.

&quot;Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow,&quot; the show&#x27;s theme music, was composed by Dave Grusin and Morgan Ames and sung by Sammy Davis Jr., in addition to being a chart hit for two other artists.

==Overview==
Anthony Vincenzo &quot;Tony&quot; Baretta is an unorthodox plainclothes police detective (Badge #609) with the 53rd Precinct in an unnamed, fictional city. He resides in Apartment 2C of the run-down King Edward Hotel with Fred, his Triton cockatoo. A master of disguise, Baretta wears many while performing his duties. When not working he usually wears a short-sleeve sweatshirt, casual slacks, a brown suede jacket and a newsboy cap.

Baretta is often seen with an unlit cigarette in his lips or behind his ear. His catchphrases include &quot;Don&#x27;t do the crime if you can&#x27;t do the time&quot;, &quot;You can take dat to da bank&quot; and &quot;And dat&#x27;s the name of dat tune.&quot; When exasperated, he occasionally speaks in asides to his late father, Louie Baretta. He drives a rusted-out Mist Blue 1966 Chevrolet Impala four-door sport sedan nicknamed &quot;The Blue Ghost&quot; (license plate 532 BEM). He frequents Ross&#x27;s Billiard Academy and refers to his numerous girlfriends as his &quot;cousins&quot;.

==Episodes==

==Cast==
* Anthony Vincenzo &quot;Tony&quot; Baretta (Robert Blake), a police detective.
* Billy Truman (Tom Ewell), retired cop who used to work with Baretta&#x27;s father Louie at the 53rd Precinct.
* Rooster (Michael D. Roberts), a streetwise pimp and Baretta&#x27;s favorite informant.
* Inspector Shiller (Dana Elcar) and Lieutenant Hal Brubaker (Edward Grover), Baretta&#x27;s supervisors.
* Detective Foley (John Ward), police detective.
* Fats (Chino &#x27;Fats&#x27; Williams), a gravelly-voiced, older detective.
* Detective Nopke (Ron Thompson), a rookie detective.
* Little Moe (Angelo Rossitto), a shoeshine man and informant.
* Mr. Nicholas (Titos Vandis), a mob boss.
* Mr. Muncie (Paul Lichtman), the owner of a liquor store at 52nd and Main.

==Production==
Upon watching Blake in the 1973 film &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot;, then ABC executive Michael Eisner contacted him about doing a police series, which culminated in &quot;Baretta&quot;. Blake was given creative control in most aspects of production.

The series came about as a reboot of &quot;Toma&quot; when actor Tony Musante chose to move on after completing his single season commitment to the series.

The theme song, &quot;Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow&quot;, was written by Dave Grusin and Morgan Ames; initially an instrumental, lyrics were added in later seasons that were sung by Sammy Davis, Jr. Every episode of &quot;Baretta&quot; began with the song, which contained the motto, &quot;Don&#x27;t do the crime if you can&#x27;t do the time.&quot; According to Blake, studio executives did not want Davis&#x27;s vocals for the theme song for fear that audiences would think &quot;Baretta&quot; was a black series. Blake threatened to leave production if Davis&#x27;s recording was rejected. His bosses relented.

The song was released as a single in Europe in 1976, reaching number one in the Dutch Top 40 as &quot;Baretta&#x27;s Theme&quot;. The music for the theme song was performed by Los Angeles-based Latin influenced Rock band El Chicano. El Chicano also released the song as a 45 and also as a track on one of their albums. The &quot;Baretta&quot; theme song by El Chicano was a huge hit in many countries including Turkey, Malaysia, Singapore, France and The Philippines.

The song was released as a single in the US, but only charted as high as #42 on the Adult Contemporary Chart, while it &quot;bubbled under the Hot 100&quot; at #101.

Fred the cockatoo was portrayed by two Triton cockatoos named Lalah and Weird Harold, the latter used as a stunt double for flying sequences.

==Cancellation==
On April 27, 1977, Blake announced that he would leave after completing his contractual run on the show for the season. &quot;I proved everything I had to prove,&quot; he said. Through his efforts, he said, &quot;Baretta&quot; became the only midseason replacement to win an Emmy.

&quot;I put &quot;Baretta&quot; in the top 10, I tried to make a human being out of a cop and I tried to do a cop show and make social comment,&quot; he added.

In a 1996 TV interview with Tom Snyder, Blake stated that he hated being committed to the series and compared it to screwing a gorilla. &quot;&quot;Baretta&quot; was a terrible experience,&quot; Blake stated, &quot;you do a series so you can work with giants [in film].&quot;

==Broadcast syndication==
After its initial run in syndication beginning in 1979, the series later re-appeared on TV Land in 1999 as part of a package of series licensed from Universal. MeTV aired reruns of &quot;Baretta&quot; on Saturday afternoons in 2007. It was also aired on WKAQ-TV.

==Home media==
On October 29, 2002, Universal Studios released the first season of &quot;Baretta&quot; on Region 1 DVD in the United States. On July 26th, 2017, The Complete 2nd Season was released in the UK with French audio as the only audio option. The series has been rarely televised or even streamed since the late 2000s. Many have asserted that this is due to Blake&#x27;s alleged involvement in the 2001 murder of his second wife Bonnie Lee Bakley.
==Cultural references==
&quot;Mad&quot; magazine spoofed the series as &quot;Barfetta&quot;.

In Taskmaster Live, a 2016 show at the Edinburgh Festival contested by five television executives, Jeff Ford, the UK Managing Director of Fox Networks Group and SVP and Content Development Manager for Europe and Africa, described Baretta as a &quot;lesser known 1960s vehicle&quot;.

In the &quot;Barney Miller&quot; episode &quot;Copycat&quot;, Detective Arthur Dietrich tells a copycat criminal that cops and committing a crime are not like they are depicted on television, and ends by saying, &quot;And dat&#x27;s the name of dat tune.&quot;

In the film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, protagonist Mr. Orange steels himself before meeting main antagonist Joe Cabot by saying &quot;You&#x27;re not gonna get hurt. You&#x27;re fucking Baretta. They believe every fucking word &#x27;cause you&#x27;re super cool.&quot;

In the sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, in the season one episode “Stolen Car”, Bob Pinciotti tells his wife Midge, &quot;you can&#x27;t tell me anything while I&#x27;m watching &quot;Baretta&quot;, it&#x27;s complicated.&quot;

In the &quot;Party Down&quot; episode &quot;Investors Dinner&quot; (2009), the opening scene is an argument about why Tony Baretta is named so, with two characters arguing that it&#x27;s because he carries a Beretta pistol.

<text>The Progressive Democratic Party (Malay: Parti Demokratik Progresif, Abbrev: PDP), formerly known as Sarawak Progressive Democratic Party (Abbrev: SPDP), is a Sarawak-based political party in Malaysia founded in 2002. The party was founded in the wake of the de-registration of the Sarawak National Party in November 2002 by a faction aligned to the Chief Minister of Sarawak, Abdul Taib Mahmud, led by William Mawan Ikom. The party has since rebranded in using a new name - Progressive Democratic Party since 2017 and has planned to expand to certain West Malaysian states e.g. Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Johor (where it has established 6 divisions at the moment). It is one of the former component party of the Barisan Nasional coalition. Following the fall of BN in the 2018 general election and in the aftermath of meeting between all Sarawak-based BN coalition parties on 12 June 2018, PDP left the coalition to form a new Sarawak-based coalition of Sarawak Parties Alliance.

In April 2024, Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) were merged into PDP and its members were accepted into PDP, including 3 MLAs of PSB.

== Electoral history ==
At the 2011 Sarawak state election, PDP won six out of the eight seats it contested.

In the 2013 General Election, all 4 of their candidates won their respective seats, including William Mawan himself, where he won in P205 Saratok, against Ali Biju of PKR.

At the 2021 Sarawak state election, PDP won five out of the six seats it contested.

<text>Nopaltepec is municipality in State of Mexico, Mexico. It&#x27;s municipal seat and second largest town is the town of Nopaltepec. It is approximately from Toluca, the state capital. The name derives from Náhuatl meaning &quot;on nopal (paddle cactus) hill&quot;. It was originally called &quot;Santa María de la Asunción Nopaltepec&quot; but, after 1960, only Nopaltepec has been used.

==Village==
The village first appears in records around 1603 though villages in this area have existed since pre-Hispanic times. It is also known as Santa María de la Asunción Nopaltepec. In 1901 the Parish of Nopaltepec is established and was expanded in 1932. The village had a population of 3,224 in 2005.

==The municipality==
The largest town is San Felipe Teotitlán, followed by the municipal seat Nopaltepec, San Miguel Atepoxco, Ex-hacienda la Puerta, Santa Inés Amiltepec, Ex-hacienda de Tepatepec, Colonia Venta de Cruz, Las Ambrises, and Rancho San Felipe (Moratepec).

The municipality has 87.94 square km of territory and a total population of 8,182 as of 2005. It is bordered by the municipality of Axapusco and the state of Hidalgo.

The municipality is principally rural, mainly flat plateau with small elevations. With no lakes or rivers, all water supplies come from underground aquifers. Its flora is adapted to its semi-arid climate and include: pirúl, mezquite, licorice root, sweet acacia, date palm, maguey, various varieties of nopal, eucalyptus, camphor trees, pine, wild privets, mimosa, ash tree, and ornamental palms. Wild fauna include: rabbits, hares, squirrels, skunks, cacomixtle, tlacuache, chachahuate, lizards, cencuate, trout, rattlesnakes, linger and scorpions. Agriculture is the primary economic activity with the production of cactus fruit, pulque and basic grains for auto-consumption. There is some fish-farming here as well. There is almost no livestock here and only a few home-based workshops producing clothing, plastic items, plumbing, and metalworks.

==History==
The villages of this area in the pre-Hispanic era, were dominated by the Teotihuacan culture. Around 1134, the Chichimecas migrated here from what is now the north of Mexico, taking over these same villages. What now the municipality was part of the dominion of Xaltoca around 1200 and when this lord fell, the kind King Xolotl consolidated this area along with Teotitln, Atepoxco, as well as other villages of the time. During the Aztec Empire, Nopalteppec was part of the Acolhua region. After the Conquest, the area became part of the &quot;alcaldia mayor&quot; (lit. major mayorship) of Otompan and would remain so throughout the 18th century. The municipality would not be officially declared until 1871 with the name of Santa María de la Asunción Nopaltepec. 

The Battle of Venta de Cruz took place here in 1816 as part of the Mexican War of Independence.

<doc id="575105" wikidata="Q5313174" url="?curid=575105" title="The Dukes (New Zealand band)">
<text>The Dukes are a five-piece rock band from Christchurch, New Zealand. Their debut album, &quot;Lil Sunshine&quot;, was released in 2005. Their second album, &quot;Still Life&quot;, was released in 2010 throughout New Zealand spawning the Gold certified Top 10 single &quot;Vampires&quot;.

==Music career==

===Early beginnings===

The Dukes formed in early 2003 as a result of a band name change. Formerly known as Deluxeboy. The four piece featured brothers, Matt and Jo Barus, Brad Banks and Fausia Fialele.
The name of the Dukes comes from the cult classic seventies television show The Dukes of Hazzard.

The Dukes released their debut album, Lil&#x27; Sunshine, in May 2005. Three singles have been released from this album: &quot;Mornin&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Luv Came Thru&quot;, and &quot;Rather Be With You&quot;. In the past they have toured the New Zealand University Orientation Circuit and have also opened for INXS.

===2007-2009: Line-up changes and commercial breakthrough===
2007 was a big year in the Dukes history. In the early part of the year a new member was added to the group, Christchurch musician L.A. Mitchell. Mitchell is also a solo artist and released her debut solo album in the later part of 2007, titled &quot;Debut&quot;. In May the original Dukes drummer, Fausia Fialele, left the group suddenly and was replaced by Dan Kennedy. Fialele rejoined the group following Kennedys departure from the group in 2009. The Dukes now stand as a five piece.

On Friday 9 March came the Dukes biggest breakthrough of their career. They entered and won the New Zealand leg of MTV Kickstart Competition, a music competition for bands from both New Zealand and Australia. Eventually they came second, however, to Yves Klein Blue, one of the Australian bands in the competition but the prize for their New Zealand leg win entitled them to many prizes including the chance to take part in the New Zealand first Mile High gig. 
In May they helped officially open up New Zealand Music Month in both Christchurch and Auckland and featured alongside high profile local acts including Fur Patrol.

After winning the MTV Kickstart Competition, Dukes released &quot;Always Forever&quot; as a promo single. The song is a fan favourite and found minor success on local radio. The video for the song was filmed by MTV New Zealand and was released to television in July. They followed by releasing &quot;Time Is A Train&quot; in 2008, it also found minor success.

2007 was a successful year for the Dukes music with three of their songs appearing on TV, two of them of which were high-profile television shows: the first was American Drama Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series) and the second was New Zealand local hit drama Outrageous Fortune (TV series) which featured the group&#x27;s song, &quot;Luv Came Thru&quot;; their third appearance was in Episode 108 (&quot;Emily&quot;) of the Journeyman TV series, with the song &quot;Mornin&quot;&#x27;. Throughout the second part of 2007 the band was involved in two big tours with local rock band The Have and late 1970s and early 1980s pop/rock band Th&#x27; Dudes.

===2010 – present: &quot;Vampires&quot; and &quot;Still Life&quot;===
In March 2010 their first single &quot;Vampires&quot;, off their second studio album &quot;Still Life&quot;, debuted on the RIANZ New Zealand Singles Chart at #32, their first release to officially chart 7 months after its initial release. This was also their first release on their own label &quot;Play Nicely&quot; after ending their association with Sony earlier in the year. The single rose to #20 the following week and entered the Top 10 at #9 on the 26 April Chart, attributed to its success on radio and through digital downloads. On Monday 23 May 2010 &quot;Vampires&quot; was certified Gold in New Zealand after selling more than 7,500 units.

In May they were nominated for the &quot;Breakthrough Artist&quot; award at the Juice TV Awards. At the award show they went on to win the award for the Video of the Year. They also went on to collect the award for &quot;Up &amp; Coming&quot; act in the Myspace New Zealand 2010 Choice Awards.

Following the commercial success of &quot;Vampires&quot;, &quot;Self Control&quot;, was released to radio in April 2010. A third single &quot;Time is a Train&quot; followed in November, this being the new album version of the song after previously being released as a buzz single in mid-2008.

In September to coincide with their Acoustic Church Tour with Dave Dobbyn their first acoustic EP, &quot;Settle Down - Acoustic EP&quot; was released. Due to strong sales across the tours shows and online the EP debuted on the RIANZ New Zealand Album Chart at #23 on 13 September 2010. It peaked two weeks later at #16 making it their first release to chart on the NZ Album chart.

Their second full-length album, &quot;Still Life&quot;, was released on 8 November 2010. It debuted on the RIANZ New Zealand Album Chart at #26 on 15 November 2010 making it their second release to chart.

<doc id="575113" wikidata="Q273177" url="?curid=575113" title="Dorothy Kilgallen">
<text>Dorothy Mae Kilgallen (July 3, 1913 – November 8, 1965) was an American columnist, journalist, and television game show panelist. After spending two semesters at the College of New Rochelle, she started her career shortly before her 18th birthday as a reporter for the Hearst Corporation&#x27;s &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot;. In 1938, she began her newspaper column &quot;The Voice of Broadway&quot;, which was eventually syndicated to more than 140 papers. In 1950, she became a regular panelist on the television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, continuing in the role until her death.

Kilgallen&#x27;s columns featured mostly show-business news and gossip, but also ventured into other topics, such as politics and organized crime. She wrote front-page articles for multiple newspapers on the Sam Sheppard trial and, years later, events related to the John F. Kennedy assassination, such as testimony by Jack Ruby.

==Early life==
Kilgallen was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of newspaper reporter James Lawrence Kilgallen (1888–1982) and his wife, Mae Ahern (1888–1985). She was of Irish descent, and Catholic. She had one sister, Eleanor (1919–2014), who was six years younger. The family moved to various regions of the United States until 1920, when the International News Service hired James Kilgallen as a roving correspondent based in New York City. The family settled in Brooklyn, New York. Dorothy Kilgallen was a student at Erasmus Hall High School. After completing two semesters at The College of New Rochelle, she dropped out to take a job as a reporter for the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot;. The newspaper was owned and operated by the Hearst Corporation, which also owned International News Service, her father&#x27;s employer.

==Career==
In 1936, Kilgallen and two other New York newspaper reporters competed in a race around the world, using only means of transportation available to the general public. She was the only woman to compete in the contest and came in second. She described the race in her book &quot;Girl Around The World&quot;, which is credited as the story idea for the 1937 movie &quot;Fly-Away Baby&quot; starring Glenda Farrell as a character partly inspired by Kilgallen.

In November 1938, Kilgallen began writing a daily column, the &quot;Voice of Broadway,&quot; for Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;, after the corporation merged the &quot;Evening Journal&quot; with the &quot;American&quot;. The column, which she wrote until her death in 1965, featured mostly New York show business news and gossip, but also ventured into other topics such as politics and organized crime. The column eventually was syndicated to 146 newspapers via King Features Syndicate. Its success motivated Kilgallen to move her parents and Eleanor from Brooklyn to Manhattan, where she continued to live with them until she got married.

On April 6, 1940, Kilgallen married Richard Kollmar, a musical comedy actor and singer who had starred in the Broadway show &quot;Knickerbocker Holiday&quot; and was performing in the Broadway cast of &quot;Too Many Girls&quot; at the time of their wedding. They had three children: Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; (b. 1941), Jill (b. 1943), and Kerry Kollmar (b. 1954), and remained married until Kilgallen&#x27;s death.

Early in their marriage, Kilgallen and Kollmar both launched careers in network radio. Kilgallen&#x27;s program &quot;Voice of Broadway&quot; was broadcast on CBS during World War II, and Kollmar starred as the titular character in the nationally syndicated crime drama &quot;Boston Blackie&quot; that ran from 1941 to 1945.

Beginning in April 1945, Kilgallen and Kollmar co-hosted a weekday radio talk show on WOR 710 AM. &quot;Breakfast With Dorothy and Dick&quot; was broadcast from their 16-room apartment at 640 Park Avenue. The show followed them when they bought a neo-Georgian townhouse at 45 East 68th Street in 1952. The radio program, like Kilgallen&#x27;s newspaper column, mixed entertainment news and gossip with serious matters. Kilgallen and Kollmar occasionally had a major league baseball player as a guest on the show. The couple continued doing the show from their home until 1963. Kilgallen&#x27;s long-time fellow panelist on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, Arlene Francis, also hosted a weekday talk show on WOR for many years.

===Frank Sinatra feud===
Kilgallen and singer Frank Sinatra were fairly good friends for several years and were photographed rehearsing in a radio studio for a 1948 broadcast. Eventually, they had a falling out after she wrote a multi-part 1956 front-page feature article titled &quot;The Real Frank Sinatra Story&quot;. In addition to the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;, Hearst-owned newspapers across the United States ran the feature.

Following this publication, Sinatra made derogatory comments about Kilgallen&#x27;s physical appearance to his nightclub audiences in New York and Las Vegas. However, he stopped short of mentioning her name on television or during magazine and newspaper interviews.

===Sam Sheppard murder trial===

Kilgallen covered the 1954 murder trial of Sam Sheppard. Sheppard was a doctor convicted of killing his wife at their home in the Cleveland suburb of Bay Village.

The &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; carried the banner front-page headline that Kilgallen was &quot;shocked&quot; by the guilty verdict because of what she argued were serious flaws in the prosecution&#x27;s case. At the time of the Cleveland jury&#x27;s guilty verdict in December 1954, Kilgallen&#x27;s sharp criticism of it was controversial and a Cleveland newspaper dropped her column in response. Her articles and columns in 1954 did not reveal all she had witnessed in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas.

Nine years after the verdict and sentence, and after the judge had died, she claimed at an event held at the Overseas Press Club in New York that the judge had told her before the start of jury selection that Sheppard was &quot;guilty as hell&quot;.

Attorney F. Lee Bailey, who was working on a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition for his client Sheppard, attended the Overseas Press Club event, heard what Kilgallen told the crowd, and then asked her privately if she would help him. &quot;Some days later,&quot; as Bailey wrote in his memoir &quot;The Defense Never Rests&quot;, &quot;we obtained a deposition from Dorothy that was inserted into the petition submitted to&quot; Carl Andrew Weinman, judge for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Bailey also included in the &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition a statement from Edward Murray, who had worked in 1954 as a court clerk at the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Similar to Kilgallen&#x27;s statement, Murray&#x27;s statement indicated that Edward J. Blythin, the original Sheppard judge, had said that Sheppard was guilty even before the grand jury indicted him on August 17, 1954.

In July 1964, four months after the Overseas Press Club event where Kilgallen broke her silence about the deceased Judge Blythin, Judge Weinman of the federal court granted Bailey&#x27;s &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition, Sam Sheppard was released from prison amid much newspaper publicity, and Sheppard met Kilgallen at a &quot;late-night champagne party&quot; (as described by Bailey in &quot;The Defense Never Rests&quot;) in Cleveland. After Kilgallen&#x27;s death, Sheppard was retried and acquitted.

===Kennedy assassination===
Kilgallen was publicly skeptical of the conclusions of the Warren Commission&#x27;s report about the assassination of President Kennedy and Jack Ruby&#x27;s shooting of Lee Oswald, and she wrote several newspaper articles on the subject. On February 23, 1964, she published an article in the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; about a conversation she had with Jack Ruby, when he was at his defense table during a recess in his murder trial.

She also obtained a copy of Ruby&#x27;s testimony to the Warren Commission, which he had given on June 7, 1964. Kilgallen published it in August 1964 in three installments on the front pages of the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, and other newspapers.

===&quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;===

Kilgallen became a panelist on the American television game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, beginning on its first broadcast, which aired live on February 2, 1950. The series was telecast from New York City on the CBS television network until 1967. She was seen almost every Sunday evening on the show for 15 years (until her death).

Beginning in 1959, the series was not always telecast live. Goodson Todman Productions used videotape, a recent invention. In 1961, producers were able to stockpile enough videotaped episodes so that Kilgallen and fellow panelists Arlene Francis and Bennett Cerf, along with host John Charles Daly, could take their summer vacations. In 1965, they returned to do a live telecast on September 12. It was followed by eight consecutive Sunday nights when Kilgallen appeared live, the last of them being November 7.

==Death==
On November 8, 1965, Kilgallen was found dead in her Manhattan townhouse located at 45 East 68th Street. Her death was determined to have been caused by a combination of alcohol and barbiturates. The police said there was no indication of violence or suicide. According to New York City medical examiner James Luke, the circumstances of her death were undetermined, but emphasized that &quot;the overdose could well have been accidental&quot;.

Her funeral Mass took place on November 11 at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in Manhattan; John Daly, Arlene Francis, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; producer Mark Goodson, Betty White, Ed Sullivan, Joseph E. Levine, and Bob Considine were among the 2,600 people attending. Coverage of the funeral in the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;, where she had worked, included &quot;Mrs. Bennett Cerf&quot; (Phyllis Fraser), among the notable people who attended. She was interred at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, Westchester County, New York.

===Legacy===
In 1960, Kilgallen was one of the initial 500 people chosen to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
The &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; telecast on November 14, 1965, paid tribute to Kilgallen. Kitty Carlisle filled in for Kilgallen during the episode, and said on camera that although she was occupying Kilgallen&#x27;s seat, &quot;no one could ever possibly take her place.&quot;

In a 1996 memoir, Kilgallen&#x27;s colleague and friend Theo Wilson wrote that her work as a crime reporter was often overlooked during her lifetime and was forgotten after her death:

&quot;Part of being a good reporter is to be anonymous, to stay out of the story so that you can better watch and study and listen to the principals. She couldn&#x27;t do that, mostly because people wouldn&#x27;t let her. She&#x27;d walk into a trial and the prosecutor would ask for her autograph for his wife or the judge would send out greetings.&quot;

The main construction was completed on 16 May 1972. Chiang&#x27;s funeral was held in the main hall of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in 1975. Originally, the Memorial Hall primarily functioned as a place to display the historical relics of Sun&#x27;s life and the Xinhai Revolution. It was later opened to exhibitions and performances. Taiwan&#x27;s highest movie award ceremony, the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards, is held annually in the Memorial Hall Auditorium.

Initially affiliated with the city government of Taipei, the Memorial Hall became part of the Ministry of Education, together with the Chung-Shan Building in Yangmingshan, in 1986.

<text>Mary Margaret Helgenberger (born November 16, 1958) is an American actress. She began her career in the early 1980s and first came to attention for playing the role of Siobhan Ryan on the daytime soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; from 1982 to 1986. She is best known for her role as Catherine Willows in the CBS police procedural drama &quot;&quot; (2000–13), the subsequent television film &quot;Immortality&quot; (2015), and the second and third seasons of the sequel series &quot;&quot; (2022–2024). Helgenberger is also known for playing the role of K.C. Koloski in the ABC drama &quot;China Beach&quot; (1988–91), which earned her the 1990 Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. She is also known for roles in the TV series &quot;Under the Dome&quot; and &quot;Intelligence&quot;, and the films &quot;Species&quot; (1995), &quot;Species II&quot; (1998), &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000), and &quot;Mr. Brooks&quot; (2007).

==Early life==
Helgenberger was born November 16, 1958, in Fremont, Nebraska, to Mary Kay (&quot;née&quot; Bolte), a nurse, and Hugh Helgenberger, a meat inspector. She has an older sister Ann and a younger brother Curt.
They are of Irish and German descent and had a Roman Catholic upbringing. They were raised in North Bend, Nebraska. She graduated from North Bend Central High School, where she played the French horn in its marching band. 

Until college, Helgenberger aspired to be a nurse like her mother. She attended Kearney State College (now the University of Nebraska at Kearney) in Kearney, Nebraska, then Northwestern University&#x27;s School of Speech (now the School of Communication) in Evanston, Illinois, earning a B.S. degree in speech and drama.

==Career==

Helgenberger began as a nightly weathergirl at KHGI-TV, the ABC affiliate in Kearney, while attending college (her name was changed by the producer to Margi McCarty. McCarty was her grandmother&#x27;s maiden name). During the summer, she also worked as a deboner at her father&#x27;s meatpacking plant. After portraying the role of Blanche Dubois in a university production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, she developed an interest in acting.

While performing in a summer 1981 NU campus production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;, where she played Kate, Helgenberger was spotted by a scout for the TV soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;.

Soon after completing college, Helgenberger landed her first professional role on the long-running ABC Daytime soap opera in March 1982, playing amateur cop Siobhan Ryan Novak DuBujak, a role previously played by Ann Gillespie. After nearly four years, Helgenberger left the show in January 1986 to pursue new opportunities.

Helgenberger guest-starred in episodes of the ABC series &quot;&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Matlock&quot;, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;thirtysomething&quot;. She also played a regular role as Natalie Thayer, opposite Margot Kidder and James Read, on the six-episode drama comedy series &quot;Shell Game&quot; (1987).

She then starred as Karen Charlene &quot;K.C.&quot; Koloski, a prostitute turned entrepreneur, on the ABC war drama series &quot;China Beach&quot; from 1988 to 1991. The role earned her an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 1990.

In 1989, Helgenberger made her feature-film debut in a leading role as an all-night answering-service operator in one segment of the Wheat brothers&#x27; horror anthology &quot;After Midnight&quot;. She followed it up with a role in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s romantic comedy-drama &quot;Always&quot; (starring Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter, and John Goodman), a modern version of the original 1943 Victor Fleming film &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;.

During the early to mid-1990s, Helgenberger played the love interest to Woody Harrelson&#x27;s character in &quot;The Cowboy Way&quot; (1994), and had a small role as Capt. Alison Sinclair in Michael Bay&#x27;s action comedy film &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1995). She also played Dr. Laura Baker, a molecular biologist, in Roger Donaldson&#x27;s science-fiction thriller, &quot;Species&quot; (1995), and reprised the role in a sequel, &quot;Species II&quot; (1998).

Helgenberger had roles in the television films &quot;Not on the Frontline&quot; and &quot;In Sickness and in Health&quot;. She played opposite Bruno Kirby in &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Waiting&quot;, and as a novelist on the miniseries &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s The Tommyknockers&quot; opposite Jimmy Smits. After playing a recurring role as George Clooney&#x27;s love interest on NBC&#x27;s medical drama &quot;ER&quot;, Helgenberger appeared as David Caruso&#x27;s sex-starved widow on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Elmore Leonard&#x27;s Gold Coast&quot;. She starred with Steven Seagal in the 1997 action film &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; and portrayed the furious sibling to Steven Weber&#x27;s character on the miniseries about the elusive Gulf War syndrome, &quot;Thanks of a Grateful Nation&quot;. She also starred opposite Ann-Margret in Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Happy Face Murders&quot;.

In 2000, Helgenberger made a guest appearance in the Valentine&#x27;s Day episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, in which Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) finally wears down his dad Martin&#x27;s resistance and gets the older man to accompany him to the opera. Actually, this invitation is but a smokescreen, so that Frasier can &quot;accidentally&quot; run into his newest dream girl Emily (Helgenberger).

Starting in October 2000, Helgenberger starred in the role of Catherine Willows, a former show girl employed as a blood-spatter analyst, on the hit CBS drama &quot;&quot;. Her performance as the female lead has earned her two Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe nominations. In 2005, she and her fellow cast members won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. When &quot;CSI&quot; first started filming, Helgenberger visited the Clark County Coroner&#x27;s Office to learn about her role, even viewing autopsies in progress. Helgenberger got the chance to act with her husband, Alan Rosenberg, when he guest-starred on &quot;CSI&quot;, season five (&quot;Weeping Willows&quot;) and season seven (&quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;).

During her time on the show, Helgenberger acted in the feature film &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; and portrayed Patsy Ramsey on the miniseries about the mysterious murder of six-year-old beauty-pageant contestant JonBenét Ramsey in &quot;Perfect Murder, Perfect Town&quot;. She also starred as Dennis Quaid&#x27;s wife and Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s mother in writer-director Paul Weitz&#x27;s romantic drama comedy &quot;In Good Company&quot; (2004).

In 2006, Helgenberger&#x27;s hometown of North Bend, Nebraska, renamed the street on which Helgenberger had her childhood home &quot;Helgenberger Avenue&quot;. In 2012, speaking to &quot;The Daily Northwestern&quot; - the Northwestern University&#x27;s main student newspaper - she recalled that, &quot;It really is pretty special. When I went back for the unveiling of it, which was about five years ago, I was very touched by it. A lot of people turned out, and there was a program up at my high school where the students were doing scenes from shows that I had done.&quot;

In 2007, she was in the film &quot;Mr. Brooks&quot; with Kevin Costner in which her character&#x27;s daughter is played by Danielle Panabaker, the sister of Kay Panabaker, who plays her fictional daughter on &quot;CSI&quot;.

In April 2008, Helgenberger was chosen as an endorser of the Got Milk? campaign.

In December 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine placed Helgenberger third among primetime&#x27;s top-earning women, with estimated earnings of $9.5 million, after Tyra Banks and Katherine Heigl.

Helgenberger received the 2,458th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on January 23, 2012, for her television work.

She lent her voice as Greek goddess Hera to the straight-to-video animated film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;.

Following William Petersen&#x27;s departure from &quot;CSI&quot;, Helgenberger became one of the two highest paid actors in any of the &quot;CSI&quot; franchises, earning $375,000 per episode, the same as David Caruso, and $25,000 more per episode than Laurence Fishburne.

Helgenberger appeared in only the first 12 episodes of the 12th season of &quot;CSI&quot;, as she wanted to return to the stage. The producers said they left the door open for Helgenberger if she wanted to return. Helgenberger left the show on January 25, 2012, during a two-part episode (&quot;Ms. Willows Regrets&quot; and &quot;Willows in the Wind&quot;). The last one was the most-watched episode of the season with 14.26 million viewers.

Helgenberger also starred as Lilian Strand in the series &quot;Intelligence&quot; alongside Josh Holloway and Meghan Ory. Additionally, she briefly returned to &quot;CSI&quot; as Catherine for the 300th episode. In February 2015, she joined the third season of &quot;Under the Dome&quot;.

In May–June 2014, Helgenberger acted onstage in a production of the 2011 play &quot;The Other Place&quot; by Sharr White, put on by the Barrington Stage Company in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In September–October 2016, she appeared at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in a revival of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;.

In 2022, Helgenberger became a series regular on &quot;&quot;, joining the show in its second season and reprising her long-running role of Catherine Willows.

==Personal life==
In 1984, Helgenberger met Alan Rosenberg, a guest actor on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;. The two became friends and started dating in 1986. They married in 1989 and have one son, Hugh Howard Rosenberg (b. 1990), named after Helgenberger&#x27;s late father. On December 1, 2008, the couple announced that they were separating, and on March 25, 2009, Helgenberger filed for divorce. Their divorce was finalized in February 2010.

As a result of Helgenberger&#x27;s mother&#x27;s 27-year battle against breast cancer, Helgenberger and Rosenberg became involved in breast-cancer-related charity and have hosted a benefit Marg and Alan&#x27;s Celebrity Weekend annually in Omaha, Nebraska, since 1999.

In April 2022, Helgenberger married Charlie Haugk, whom she had been in a relationship with since the fall of 2019.

<doc id="575126" wikidata="Q2166404" url="?curid=575126" title="Isolation transformer">
<text>An isolation transformer is a transformer used to transfer electrical power from a source of alternating current (AC) power to some equipment or device while isolating the powered device from the power source, usually for safety reasons or to reduce transients and harmonics. Isolation transformers provide galvanic isolation; no conductive path is present between source and load. This isolation is used to protect against electric shock, to suppress electrical noise in sensitive devices, or to transfer power between two circuits which must not be connected. A transformer sold for isolation is often built with special insulation between primary and secondary, and is specified to withstand a high voltage between windings.
Isolation transformers block transmission of the DC component in signals from one circuit to the other, but allow AC components in signals to pass. Transformers that have a ratio of 1 to 1 between the primary and secondary windings are often used to protect secondary circuits and individuals from electrical shocks between energized conductors and earth ground. 
Suitably designed isolation transformers block interference caused by ground loops. Isolation transformers with electrostatic shields are used for power supplies for sensitive equipment such as computers, medical devices, or laboratory instruments.

Some specifications require that Isolation transformers be a part of the lightning protection on the AC circuits.

==Terminology==
Sometimes the term is used to emphasize that a device is not an autotransformer whose primary and secondary circuits are connected. Power transformers with specified insulation between primary and secondary are not usually described only as &quot;isolation transformers&quot; unless this is their primary function. Only transformers whose &quot;primary&quot; purpose is to isolate circuits are routinely described as isolation transformers.

==Operation==
Isolation transformers are designed with attention to capacitive coupling between the two windings. The capacitance between primary and secondary windings would also couple AC current from the primary to the secondary. A grounded Faraday shield between the primary and the secondary greatly reduces the coupling of common-mode noise. This may be another winding or a metal strip surrounding a winding. 
Differential noise can magnetically couple from the primary to the secondary of an isolation transformer, and must be filtered out if a problem occurs.

==Applications==

===Pulse transformers===

Some small transformers are used for isolation in pulse circuits.

===Electronics testing===
In electronics testing and servicing, an isolation transformer is a 1:1 (under load) power transformer used for safety. Without it, exposed live metal in a device under test is at a hazardous voltage relative to grounded objects such as a heating radiator or oscilloscope ground lead (a particular hazard with some old vacuum-tube equipment with live chassis). With the transformer, as there is no conductive connection between transformer secondary and primary, only a small leakage current will flow if the exposed live metal is connected to earth.

Even if an isolation transformer is used, hazardous voltages may still be present between components of the isolated device. Thus it is still possible for an operator to be exposed to lethal voltages by touching multiple elements in the circuit. An isolation transformer provides maximum protection when the device is ungrounded. Connecting it to test equipment, for example, an oscilloscope or a benchtop multimeter, may ground the circuit.

Electrical isolation is considered to be particularly important on medical equipment, and special standards apply. Often the system must additionally be designed so that fault conditions do not interrupt power, but generate a warning.

===Supply of equipment at elevated potentials===
Isolation transformers are also used for the power supply of devices not at ground potential. An example is the Austin transformer for the power supply of air-traffic obstacle warning lamps on radio antenna masts. Without the isolation transformer, the lighting circuits on the mast would conduct radio-frequency energy to ground through the power supply.

<doc id="575127" wikidata="Q13653036" url="?curid=575127" title="Newman's Own">
<text>Newman&#x27;s Own is an American food company headquartered in Westport, Connecticut. Founded in 1982 by actor Paul Newman and author A. E. Hotchner, the company donates all of its after-tax profits to charity through Newman&#x27;s Own Foundation, a private nonprofit foundation that supports child-focused programs.

==History==
The brand started in 1982 with a homemade salad dressing that Paul Newman and A. E. Hotchner prepared themselves and gave to friends as gifts. The successful reception of the salad dressing led Newman and Hotchner to commercialize it for sale, financing it with $20,000 each as seed money. Afterward, they also produced spaghetti sauce, lemonade, popcorn, fruit cocktail juices, frozen pizza, salsa, grape juice, and several other products. Newman&#x27;s Own premium wines was launched in 2008. Each label features a picture of Newman, dressed in a different costume to represent the product. The company incorporated humor into its label packaging, as in the label for its first salad dressing in 1982, &quot;Fine Foods Since February&quot;. Many of the stories on the food labels were made up.
In 1993, Newman&#x27;s daughter Nell Newman founded Newman&#x27;s Own Organics as a division of the company, later to become a separate company in late 2001. It produced organic foods, including chocolate, cookies, pretzels and pet food. Her father posed with her for the photographs on the labels. In 2014, Nell&#x27;s license with Newman&#x27;s Own was not renewed, and Newman&#x27;s Own Organics was transferred back to Newman&#x27;s Own.

Newman and Hotchner co-wrote a memoir about their company and the Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, &quot;Shameless Exploitation in Pursuit of the Common Good&quot; (), published in 2003. Newman and CEO Robert Forrester arranged for the continuation of the distribution of Newman&#x27;s Own profits to charity after Newman&#x27;s death through the establishment of the Newman&#x27;s Own Foundation.

Following Newman&#x27;s death in 2008, control of the company and foundation passed to CEO Robert Forrester. After taking over, Forrester expanded and diversified the company. Newman&#x27;s daughter, Susan, has alleged that Forrester had taken her family &quot;hostage&quot; and pushed them off the board of the Newman&#x27;s Own Foundation, the body set up to distribute company profits to charitable causes. Forrester said that the company and foundation are continuing to be operated in accordance with the late Paul Newman&#x27;s expressed wishes. Forrester&#x27;s salary increased from $185,000 to $295,000 from 2010 to 2013. Forrester was fired in 2019 as a result of an internal review following allegations of inappropriate behavior, and the board appointed Jennifer Smith Turner as interim president and CEO. In January 2020, Dr. Miriam Nelson took over those roles, and the board finalized the positions in January 2021. The current President and CEO of Newman&#x27;s Own Foundation, as of April 2023, is Alex Amouyel.

==Charitable funding and beneficiaries==
According to the Newman&#x27;s Own Foundation website, over $600 million has been generated for charity since 1982. In 2016, the company donated profits of $30 million after gross sales of $600 million. The company co-sponsored the PEN/Newman&#x27;s Own First Amendment Award, which was presented annually to a United States resident who had fought courageously, despite adversity, to safeguard the First Amendment right to freedom of expression as it applied to the written word.

A sampling of grantees is available at the Newman&#x27;s Own Foundation website along with a description of funding areas. One beneficiary of this charity is the SeriousFun Children&#x27;s Network (previously the Association of Hole in the Wall Camps), residential summer camps and programs for seriously ill children, which Newman co-founded in 1988. Today, there are camps, programs, and initiatives operating across five continents. Over 1.5 million camp experiences have been provided to children and families free of charge. While proceeds from Newman&#x27;s Own helped finance the startup of the first camp, the network and its member camps now receive funding from many other sources. Additionally, Newman&#x27;s Own Foundation also provided a grant to The MINDS Foundation to fund US operations of the non-profit that works in rural India. Other beneficiaries of the profits from Newman&#x27;s Own have included The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund (from 1983 onwards), Shining Hope for Communities, Safe Water Network, Edible Schoolyard NYC, Fisher House Foundation, the WILD Young Women Programme (New Zealand), and Pilgrims Hospices (UK).

<text>The 1943 Surprise Hurricane was the first hurricane to be entered by a reconnaissance aircraft. The first tracked tropical cyclone of the 1943 Atlantic hurricane season, this system developed as a tropical storm while situated over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on July 25. The storm gradually strengthened while tracking westward and reached hurricane status late on July 26. Thereafter, the hurricane curved slightly west-northwestward and continued intensifying. Early on July 27, it became a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale and peaked with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The system maintained this intensity until landfall on the Bolivar Peninsula in Texas late on July 27. After moving inland, the storm initially weakened rapidly, but remained a tropical cyclone until dissipating over north-central Texas on July 29.

Because the storm occurred during World War II, information and reports were censored by the government of the United States and news media. Advisories also had to be cleared through the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, resulting in late releases. This in turn delayed preparations ahead of the storm. In Louisiana, the storm produced gusty winds and heavy rains, though no damage occurred. The storm was considered the worst in Texas since the 1915 Galveston hurricane. Wind gusts up to were reported in the Galveston-Houston area. Numerous buildings and houses were damaged or destroyed. The storm caused 19 fatalities, 14 of which occurred after two separate ships sank. Overall, damage reached approximately $17 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

==Meteorological history==

A partial atmospheric circulation was observed over the extreme Southeastern United States and the eastern Gulf of Mexico as early as July 23. However, an area of disturbed weather went unnoticed until July 25, when wind shifts from southeast to northeast were observed in Burrwood and New Orleans in Louisiana, as well as Biloxi, Mississippi. Around 1800 UTC, a tropical storm developed approximately southeast of the Mississippi River Delta. Moving westward at about , the storm strengthened and became a hurricane late on July 26. Early on the following day, the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Around that time, the storm also attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 105 mph (165 km/h).

Later on July 27, the first ever reconnaissance aircraft flight into a hurricane occurred. An eye feature with a width of was observed during the flight. Around 1800 UTC on July 27, the storm made landfall on the Bolivar Peninsula in Texas with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). The system was described by the Weather Bureau as &quot;a small intense storm accompanied by full hurricane winds.&quot; Around the time of landfall, a barometric pressure of was observed. Early on July 28, the system weakened to a Category 1 hurricane, then a tropical storm about six hours later. Later that day, the storm began curving northwestward over east-central Texas. Early on July 29, it weakened further to a tropical depression. Around 0000 UTC on the following day, the storm dissipated near Whitt, Texas.

==Hurricane hunting==
This was the first hurricane that a reconnaissance aircraft intentionally flew into. During the morning hours of July 27, British pilots were training at Bryan Field in Bryan, Texas and were alerted about a hurricane approaching the Galveston area. Upon becoming informed that the planes would need to be flown away from the storm, they criticized this policy. Instead, Colonel Joe Duckworth made a bet with the British pilots that he could fly his AT-6 Texan trainer directly into the storm. Duckworth requested that Lt. Colonel Ralph O&#x27;Hair, the only navigator at the field, fly into the hurricane with him. Because neither Duckworth nor O&#x27;Hair believed that the headquarters would approve the flight, they decided to proceed without permission. Thus, Duckworth and O&#x27;Hair became the first hurricane hunters. O&#x27;Hair later compared the weather encountered during the flight to &quot;being tossed about like a stick in a dog&#x27;s mouth&quot;. After returning to Bryan Field, Lt. William Jones-Burdick requested to fly into the hurricane with Duckworth, while O&#x27;Hair decided to exit the aircraft.

== Censorship ==
The hurricane occurred during World War II, with activity from a German U-boat expected in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, ship reports were silenced. At the time, the Weather Bureau relied primarily on ship and land weather station observations to issue storm warnings. Additionally, advisories had to be cleared through the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, Louisiana, causing them to be released hours late; moreover, the advisories contained no forecast information, which would have allowed for preparation before the storm struck. The news media after the hurricane was heavily censored by the government due to national security, as information could not be leaked to the Axis powers about the loss of production of war materials. Reportedly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down a telegraph office in La Porte after a telegram was sent containing information about damage from the hurricane. The only news of this storm was published in Texas and Louisiana. After the loss of life in this storm, the government of the United States has never censored hurricane advisories again.

== Impact and aftermath ==
In Louisiana, light winds were observed, with gusts of at both Burrwood and Lake Charles. Locally heavy rains were reported in some areas, with a 24-hour precipitation total of in DeQuincy on July 28.

The storm brought strong winds to Texas, with gusts up to reported at the cooling towers at the Shell Oil Refinery in Deer Park and the Humble Oil Refinery in Baytown. Four towers were destroyed at the latter, while other damage there reduced production of toluene, which is a precursor to TNT. Some towers were also toppled at the Shell Oil Refinery in Deer Park. As these were the primary refineries producing aviation fuel for World War II, it was decided that news about this loss of production should be censored. A number of other oil derricks were destroyed throughout Chambers and Jefferson counties. At Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base near Houston, strong winds blew off the top of a hangar, destroyed five planes, and injured at least 22 cadets. Thousands in the Houston area were left without telephone and electrical service, which caused all three radio stations in the area to go off air. The nearby Houston Yacht Club also suffered heavy damage. At Point Bolivar, located on the Bolivar Peninsula, nearly all homes were destroyed by the high winds. The high school&#x27;s physical education building in La Porte, which was originally a three-story building, was reduced to only one floor after windows shattered and the support beams toppled, causing the roof to collapse. At nearby Morgan&#x27;s Point, a water tower was knocked over. On Galveston Island, a number of brick businesses, buildings, and churches collapsed.

Heavy rainfall was observed in some areas of eastern Texas, with up to in Port Arthur. There, numerous homes were flooded with of water, which included damage to furnishings, electric motors and automobiles. In downtown Galveston, a number of streets were inundated with rainwater, though flooding damage was relatively minor. Two children&#x27;s polio hospitals suffered leaking roofs and water damage, forcing patients to be evacuated by staff and University of Texas Medical Branch students. About 90 percent of all house and buildings in Texas City suffered either water damage or complete destruction, including plant sites producing war materials. However, they were discouraged from going to shelters due to a polio epidemic there. In Galveston Bay, wind-driven waves flooded the western and southern shores. However, northerly winds across the bay resulted in tides being extremely low. On Galveston Island, a storm surge of was observed. Offshore, the United States Army Corps of Engineers’s hopper dredge &quot;Galveston&quot; broke up after being smashed against the north jetty, causing 11 fatalities. The tug &quot;Titan&quot; began sinking offshore Port Arthur. Three members of the crew drowned after attempting to board a rubber raft, while another person died before the remainder of the crew reached the shore. Overall, the storm killed 19 people and caused $17 million (1943 USD) in damage to the Houston area.

Following the storm, residents were warned to boil their water and be cautious of potential food contamination due to electrical outages. The War Production Board regional office in Dallas offered relief to the victims of the storm. In La Porte, a makeshift hospital was set up in city hall. At Point Bolivar, where nearly all houses were destroyed, the now-destitute residents were transported by the Galveston chapter of the American Red Cross to Galveston for housing.

<text>Nimble Giant Entertainment, SA (formerly known as NGD Studios) is an Argentine video game developer located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The studio was acquired by Saber Interactive in 2020.

==History==
They started as a three group fusion and they first created a game for a construction kit toy called &quot;Mis Ladrillos&quot;, which is similar to Lego toys.

In 2004, Nimble Giant created a mobile gaming division, making games for known brands like Axe and doing development for the multinational GlobalFun. After releasing some successful games, GlobalFun acquired the mobile division from NGD Studios in 2007.

The company is currently continuing development of a real-time, 3D massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) which emphasizes flexible gameplay and dynamic content. The game is called &quot;Regnum Online&quot;, and it has been in development for five years before ended up being released during the first quarter of 2007. The game was intended for the Spanish-speaking market at the beginning but then improved enough to be targeted for other zones as well, more recently the game has struggled to maintain a critical population and has scaled back some of its international servers.

The game currently officially supports English, Spanish, German, French and Dutch but they have stated plans to open the translation tools so volunteers can incorporate other languages.

The game uses a proprietary engine called NG3D which was built from scratch with massive multiplayer games in mind. It supports a variety of features found in today&#x27;s engines, such as hardware shaders support, continuous world loading, asynchronous resource management and a flexible gameplay system.

&quot;Regnum Online&quot; was officially released on May 24, 2007. Any information about future expansions and features have been not disclosed yet. With the update of the NG3D engine, Nimble Giant Entertainment made graphic updates on &quot;Regnum Online&quot;. In 2011, they released a game called &quot;Bunch of Heroes&quot;, made with the new NG3D 2.0, and in 2013, they changed the game title to &quot;Champions of Regnum&quot;. In 2012, they helped on developing a game called &quot;Maldark: Conqueror of Worlds&quot; with Cartoon Network.

In late 2016, NGD acquired Red Katana, a developer founded in 2010, making its founder, Martín Cao, to replace Andrés Chilkowski as chief executive officer.

In May 2019, NGD Studios was rebranded as Nimble Giant Entertainment with the hiring of former Rockstar Games executive Jeronimo Barrera as its vice president of product development, however he left the studio in June 2020.

In November 2020, Embracer Group announced that they acquired the company through Saber Interactive, which will be the parent company. Nimble Giant partnered with Paradox Interactive for &quot;Star Trek: Infinite&quot;, a grand strategy video game set in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. After two previous rounds of layoffs in 2023, Embrace cut another 30 jobs on January 30, 2024. In March 2024, Saber was sold to Beacon Interactive, a new company from Saber co-founder Matthew Karch. Many of Saber&#x27;s studios, including Nimble Giant, were included in the sale.

<text>Raw milk or unpasteurized milk is milk that has not undergone pasteurization, a process of heating liquid foods to kill pathogens for safe consumption and extension of shelf life.

Proponents of raw milk have asserted numerous supposed benefits to consumption, including better flavor, better nutrition, contributions to the building of a healthy immune system and protection from allergies. However, no clear benefit to consumption has been found; the medical community notes there is increased risk of contracting dangerous milk borne diseases from these products. Substantial evidence of this increased risk, combined with a lack of any clear benefit, has led countries around the world to either prohibit the sale of raw milk or require warning labels on packaging when sold.

In countries where it is available for sale, its availability and regulations around its sale vary. In the European Union, individual member states can prohibit or restrict the sale of raw milk, but it is not banned outright; in some member states, the sale of raw milk through vending machines is permitted, though the packaging will typically instruct consumers to boil before consumption.

==History of raw milk and pasteurization==
Humans first learned to regularly consume the milk of other mammals following the domestication of animals during the Neolithic Revolution or the development of agriculture. This development occurred independently in several places around the world from as early as 9000–7000 BC in Mesopotamia to 3500–3000 BC in the Americas. The most important dairy animals—cattle, sheep and goats—were first domesticated in Mesopotamia, although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since. From there dairy animals spread to Europe (beginning around 7000 BC but not reaching Britain and Scandinavia until after 4000 BC), and South Asia (7000–5500 BC).

Pasteurization is widely used to prevent infected milk from entering the food supply. The pasteurization process was developed in 1864 by French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered that heating beer and wine was enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage, preventing these beverages from turning sour. The process achieves this by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage.

After sufficient scientific study led to the development of germ theory, pasteurization was introduced in the United States in the 1890s. This move successfully controlled the spread of highly contagious bacterial diseases, including &quot;E. coli&quot;, bovine tuberculosis, and brucellosis (all thought to be easily transmitted to humans through the drinking of raw milk). In the early days after the scientific discovery of bacteria, there was no product testing to determine whether a farmer&#x27;s milk was safe or infected, so all milk was treated as potentially contagious. After the first tests were developed, some farmers took steps to prevent their infected animals from being killed and removed from food production, sometimes even falsifying test results to make their animals appear free of infection. Recent advances in the analysis of milk-borne diseases have enabled scientists to track the DNA of the infectious bacteria to the cows on the farms that supplied the raw milk.

The recognition of many potentially deadly pathogens, such as &quot;E. coli&quot; 0157 H7, &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, &quot;Listeria&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella&quot;, and their possible presence in poorly produced milk products has led to the continuation of pasteurization. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other health agencies of the United States strongly recommend that the public not consume raw milk or raw milk products. Young children, the elderly, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women are more susceptible to infections originating in raw milk.

==Uses==
Some cheeses are produced with raw milk, although local statutes vary regarding what health precautions must be followed, such as aging cheese for a certain amount of time. A large proportion of the US population eats several different kinds of cheese made with raw milk, including aged Gouda cheese.

The first camembert was made from raw milk, and the (AOC) variety &quot;Camembert de Normandie&quot; (approximately 10% of all camembert production) is required by law to be made only with unpasteurized milk. Many modern cheesemakers, however, use pasteurized milk for safety, compliance with regulations, or convenience.

A thick mixture known as syllabub was created by milkmaids squirting milk directly from a cow into a container of cider, beer or other beverage.

Raw yak milk can ferment overnight to become yak butter.

==Health effects==

===Infectivity===
The potential pathogenic bacteria from raw milk include tuberculosis, diphtheria, typhoid, &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, &quot;Listeria&quot;, &quot;Brucella&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, and streptococcal infections and make it potentially unsafe to consume. Raw milk may also contain parasites such as &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;. Groups of people that are at especially high risk for developing illness from consuming raw milk include children under the age of 5, adults over the age of 65, pregnant women, and people who have a weakened immune system.

Moreover, a review published in 2012 by the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain alongside experts from several Belgian universities and institutions concluded that &quot;raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption.&quot;

Even with precautions and cold storage (optimally ), raw milk has a shelf life of 3 to 5 days.

A 2024 study showed that Influenza A virus can survive in refrigerated raw milk for several days.

The 2020–2025 H5N1 outbreak spread to dairy cattle in 2024, and influenza was detected in commercial milk supplies in the United States. The United States Food and Drug Administration warned (as has been its long-standing position) that consumers should avoid raw milk because its ability to transmit influenza to humans is unknown, but pasteurization is believed to inactivate the virus. A high mortality rate was observed among cats that drank raw milk from cows displaying symptoms of H5N1 infection.

=== Epidemiology ===
Before pasteurized milk was adopted in the US, public health officials were concerned with cow milk transmission of bovine tuberculosis to humans, with an estimated 10% of all tuberculosis cases in humans being attributed to milk consumption. Along with specific diseases, officials continue to be concerned about outbreaks. With modern pasteurization and sanitation practices, milk accounts for less than 1% of reported outbreaks caused by food and water consumption. By comparison, raw milk was associated with 25% of all disease outbreaks from food/water during the time before World War II in the U.S. From a public health standpoint, pasteurization has decreased the percentage of milk associated food/waterborne outbreaks.

Between 2007 and 2016, there were 144 outbreaks connected to raw milk consumption in the United States. Because raw milk production skips the pasteurization process, the germs that are normally removed remain in the milk product. Exposure to raw milk containing harmful germs threatens infection, resulting from bacteria including &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Listeria&quot;, and &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Additionally, depending on the severity of the infection, there may be further threats to human health. Infection has the potential to induce serious illnesses such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and Hemolytic–uremic syndrome (HUS). These illnesses can lead to severe health complications, such as kidney failure, strokes, and death.

Outbreaks have occurred from consuming food products made with raw milk. One of the potential pathogens in raw milk, &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, can survive the pasteurization process and contaminate post-pasteurization environments. Milk and dairy products made with that milk then become recontaminated. Consistent contamination persists by bacteria survival in biofilms within the processing systems.

One food item that has commonly used raw milk in its production in the past is cheese. Several different types of cheeses made with raw milk are consumed by a large portion of the United States population, including soft cheeses. Since Gouda cheese has a 60-day aging period before its consumption, it has previously been hypothesized that no bacteria would persist through that time. A review study published in the &quot;Journal of Food Protection&quot; showed that E. coli 0157:H7 can persist through the aging period of Gouda cheese. The study&#x27;s evidence included three outbreaks before 2013 associated with this specific strain of &quot;E. coli&quot; in Gouda.

===Nutrition and allergy===
&quot;With the exception of an altered organoleptic [flavor] profile, heating (particularly ultra-high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.&quot;

Raw milk advocates, such as the Weston A. Price Foundation, say that raw milk can be produced hygienically and that it has health benefits that are destroyed in the pasteurization process. Research shows only very slight differences in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk.

Proponents of raw milk in the US typically argue that while pasteurization may kill dangerous bacteria, it also kills off good bacteria claimed to have health benefits not present in pasteurized milk. The United States Food and Drug Administration has stated that this is false and that pasteurizing milk does not destroy any of its nutritional value.

One study used mice to evaluate the difference in nutritional values between raw and pasteurized milk. Mice were separated into two groups: a pasteurized milk group and a raw milk group. Each group consisted of breeding pairs. The study&#x27;s conclusion measured no significant difference in pasteurized to raw milk-consuming mice weights. Birth weights were measured from each group, and no significant differences were observed. Overall, the study showed no significant measurable difference in nutritional value in the growth and fertility of mice.

Three studies have found an inverse relationship between consumption of raw milk and asthma and allergies. However, all of these studies have been performed in children living on farms and living a farming lifestyle, rather than comparing urban children living typical urban lifestyles and with typical urban exposures based on consumption or nonconsumption of raw milk. Aspects of the overall urban vs. farming environment lifestyle have been suggested as having a role in these differences. For this reason, the overall phenomenon has been named the &quot;farm effect&quot;. A recent scientific review concluded that &quot;most studies alluding to a possible protective effect of raw milk consumption do not contain any objective confirmation of the raw milk&#x27;s status or a direct comparison with heat-treated milk. Moreover, it seems that the observed increased resistance seems to be rather related to the exposure to a farm environment or to animals than to raw milk consumption.&quot; For example, in the largest of these studies, exposure to cows and straw as well as raw milk were associated with lower rates of asthma and exposure to animal feed storage rooms and manure with lower rates of atopic dermatitis; &quot;the effect on hay fever and atopic sensitization could not be completely explained by the questionnaire items themselves or their diversity.&quot;

==Legal status==
Regulation of the commercial distribution of packaged raw milk varies around the world. Some countries have complete bans, but many do not restrict the purchase of raw milk directly from the farmer. Raw milk is sometimes distributed through a program in which the consumer owns a share in the dairy animal or the herd and, therefore, can be considered to be consuming milk from their own animal, which is legal. Raw milk is sometimes marketed for animal or pet consumption or for other uses such as soap making in places where sales for human consumption are prohibited.

===Africa===
Although milk consumption in Africa is fairly low compared to the rest of the world, in tribes where milk consumption is popular, such as the Maasai tribe, milk is typically consumed unpasteurized.

===Asia===
In rural areas of Asia, where milk consumption is popular, milk is typically unpasteurized. In large Asian cities, raw milk is typical, especially from water buffalo. In most countries of Asia, laws prohibiting raw milk are nonexistent or rarely enforced. Milk labeled as &quot;raw&quot; () is available in Japan. Still, the designation means it is 100% raw whole milk before being pasteurized. Unpasteurized milk is very uncommon in Japan. In Singapore, the sale of raw milk for human consumption is prohibited due to safety concerns outlined by the Singapore Food Agency.

In India, milk is often drunk raw, although milk supplied in major cities is sometimes pasteurized. Pasteurized or not, milk is often boiled in homes before consumption.

===Europe===
In the European Union, raw milk and products made with raw milk must be labeled to indicate this. Under EU hygiene rules, member states can prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of raw milk intended for human consumption. Individual member states can also implement stricter requirements. Usually, special sanitary regulations and frequent quality tests (at least once per month) are mandatory.

====France====
Raw milk cheeses make up about 18 percent of France&#x27;s total cheese production and are considered far superior to cheeses made from pasteurized milk. Many French cuisine traditionalists consider pasteurized cheeses almost a sacrilege. Many traditional French cheeses have solely been made from raw milk for hundreds of years. Unpasteurised cheese in France is the major source of staphylococcal food poisoning.

====Germany====
In Germany, packaged raw milk may be sold in shops under the name . The raw milk has to be packed before vending, with the necessary information (producer, shelf life, and special warnings) written on the product. The distribution license has stringent quality restrictions; , just 80 farmers in Germany had a license.

Unpackaged raw milk may only be sold under specific conditions. It must:
* only be sold at the farm where it was produced
* be from the day of or the day before production
* have a warning label &quot;Raw Milk – boil before use&quot;
* cannot be used in communal kitchens.

====Ireland====
In the Republic of Ireland, the sale and production of raw milk is legal and regulated by the Department of Agriculture. While raw milk was previously banned in Irish law, since 2015, raw milk production has been regulated in accordance with the &quot;European Communities (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations (2009)&quot;. Farmers wishing to produce more than of raw milk for human consumption are required to register with the department&#x27;s Milk Hygiene Division and consent to random sampling of their products as well as regular inspections of their production facilities. The sale and consumption of raw milk has been discouraged by various food safety experts, including the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.

====Nordic states====
Shops are not permitted to sell unpasteurised milk to consumers in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. All four countries allow limited &quot;barn door&quot; sales subject to strict controls. , just one distributor in Denmark is licensed to supply restaurants with raw milk from approved farms. Pasteurisation of milk has been common practice in Denmark and Sweden in the mid-1880s.

====Slovenia====
Raw milk has been available from refrigerated milk vending machines () all over the country since 2010. The milk sold in the machines is subject to stringent regular control.

 raw milk is also available in shops. The Slovenian National Institute of Public Health advises that consuming fresh milk from a milk machine that is not heat-treated (boiled) can pose a health risk.

====United Kingdom====

About 150 producers of raw milk are listed with the Food Standards Agency in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. They sell raw, or &quot;green top&quot; milk directly to consumers either at the farm, at a farmers&#x27; market, or through a delivery service, as it is legal to supply unpasteurized raw milk directly to consumers, but illegal to be sold to a shop. The bottle must display the warning &quot;this product has not been heat-treated and may contain organisms harmful to health&quot;, and the milk must conform to higher hygiene standards than dairies producing only pasteurised milk.

It is an offence to place raw milk or cream on the market for direct consumption in Scotland following a spate of deaths in 1983.

===North America===

====Canada====
The sale of raw milk directly to consumers has been prohibited in Canada under the &quot;Food and Drug Regulations&quot; since 1991.

Provincial laws also forbid the sale and distribution of raw milk. For instance, Ontario&#x27;s Health Protection and Promotion Act, subsection 18(1) reads: &quot;No person shall sell, offer for sale, deliver or distribute milk or cream that has not been pasteurized or sterilized in a plant that is licensed under the Milk Act or in a plant outside Ontario that meets the standards for plants licensed under the Milk Act.&quot;

In January 2010, Michael Schmidt was found not guilty on 19 charges relating to the sale of raw milk in the Ontario Court of Justice. On appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice, that decision was overturned. Schmidt was convicted on thirteen counts and imposed fines totaling $9,150 and one year of probation. A subsequent appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed.

In British Columbia, Alice Jongerden, Michael Schmidt and Gordon Watson—persons involved in the operation of her raw milk dairy—attempted to avoid enforcement of a judgement against them under the Public Health Act by challenging the constitutionality of the legislation, which deems raw milk to be a hazardous product, on the grounds that it violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This argument, and other defenses invoked by her and defendants in her business, was rejected in 2013 by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which instead found Schmidt and Watson guilty of civil contempt, and sentenced them to a 3-month suspended sentence imprisonment with a probationary period of 1 year during which &quot;Any repetition of this contempt ... will trigger the imposed sentence imprisonment of 3 months.&quot; They were also charged special costs.

Meanwhile, Canada permits the sale of raw milk cheese aged over 60 days. In 2009, the province of Quebec modified regulations to allow raw milk cheeses aged less than 60 days, provided stringent safeguards were met.

====United States====

In the early 20th century, many states within the United States allowed the sale of raw milk that was certified by a &quot;medical milk commission&quot;, effectively allowing an alternative of extra inspection for pasteurization. Most states impose restrictions on raw milk suppliers due to safety concerns. 43 U.S. states allow the sale of raw milk. Cow shares can be found, and raw milk purchased for animal consumption in many states where retail for human consumption is prohibited. The sale of raw milk cheese is permitted if the cheese has been aged for 60 days or more.

The FDA reports that, in 2002, consuming partially heated raw milk and raw milk products caused 200 Americans to become ill in some manner.

Most public health organizations, including the CDC, hold to the need for pasteurization. Before pasteurization, many dairies, especially in cities, fed their cattle on low-quality feed, producing milk rife with dangerous bacteria. Pasteurizing it was the only way to make it safely drinkable. The Cornell University Food Science Department has compiled data indicating that pathogenic microorganisms are present in between 0.87% and 12.6% of raw milk samples.

Proponents also invoke the benefits of direct marketing when promoting the sale of raw milk. The ability of the farmer to eliminate intermediaries and sell directly to the consumer allows for greater profitability. Many manufacturers sell small-scale pasteurization equipment, allowing farmers to bypass the milk processors and sell pasteurized milk directly to the consumer. Additionally, some small U.S. dairies are now beginning to adopt low-temperature vat pasteurization. Advocates of low-temperature vat pasteurization note that it produces a product similar to raw milk in composition.

Food freedom advocates cite libertarian arguments in claiming a basic civil right of each person to weigh the risks and benefits in choosing the food one eats, including the choice to consume raw milk.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
The sale of raw milk for drinking purposes is illegal in all states and territories in Australia, as is all raw milk cheese. This has been circumvented somewhat by selling raw milk as &quot;bath milk&quot;. An exception to the cheese rule has been made recently for two Roquefort cheeses. There is some indication of share owning cows, allowing the &quot;owners&quot; to consume the raw milk, but also evidence that the government is trying to close this loophole.

On 8 November 2015, four-year-old Apu Khangura died of hemolytic–uremic syndrome, and seven other children became seriously ill following the consumption of raw milk. In response, the Victorian government created new regulations that require producers to treat raw milk to reduce pathogens or to make the product unpalatable to taste, such as making it bitter.

====New Zealand====
Raw milk for drinking and raw milk products can be made and sold in New Zealand but are highly regulated to offset the pathogen risk. Producers of raw milk for sale to consumers must be registered. Raw milk must either be collected by the purchaser from the producer&#x27;s farm or delivered to the purchaser&#x27;s home.

<text>A submersible is an underwater vehicle which needs to be transported and supported by a larger watercraft or platform. This distinguishes submersibles from submarines, which are self-supporting and capable of prolonged independent operation at sea.

There are many types of submersibles, including both human-occupied vehicles (HOVs) and uncrewed craft, variously known as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Submersibles have many uses including oceanography, underwater archaeology, ocean exploration, tourism, equipment maintenance and recovery and underwater videography.

==History==
The first recorded self-propelled underwater vessel was a small oar-powered submarine conceived by William Bourne (c. 1535 – 1582) and designed and built by Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel in 1620, with two more improved versions built in the following four years. Contemporary accounts state that the final model was demonstrated to King James I in person, who may even have been taken aboard for a test dive. There do not appear to have been any further recorded submersibles until Bushnell&#x27;s &quot;Turtle&quot;.

The first submersible to be used in war was designed and built by American inventor David Bushnell in 1775 as a means to attach explosive charges to enemy ships during the American Revolutionary War. The device, dubbed Bushnell&#x27;s &quot;Turtle&quot;, was an oval-shaped vessel of wood and brass. It had tanks that were filled with water to make it dive and then emptied with the help of a hand pump to make it return to the surface. The operator used two hand-cranked propellers to move vertically or laterally under the water. The vehicle had small glass windows on top and naturally luminescent wood affixed to its instruments so that they could be read in the dark.

Bushnell&#x27;s &quot;Turtle&quot; was first set into action on September 7, 1776, at New York Harbor to attack the British flagship . Sergeant Ezra Lee operated the vehicle at that time. Lee successfully brought &quot;Turtle&quot; against the underside of &quot;Eagle&quot;″s hull but failed to attach the charge because of the strong water currents.

Manned submersibles are primarily used by special forces, which can use this type of vessel for a range of specialised missions.

==Operation==
Apart from size, the main technical difference between a &quot;submersible&quot; and a &quot;submarine&quot; is that submersibles are not fully autonomous and may rely on a support facility or vessel for replenishment of power and breathing gases. Submersibles typically have shorter range, and operate primarily underwater, as most have little function at the surface. Some submersibles operate on a &quot;tether&quot; or &quot;umbilical&quot;, remaining connected to a tender (a submarine, surface vessel or platform). Submersibles have been able to dive to full ocean depth, over below the surface.

Submersibles may be relatively small, hold only a small crew, and have no living facilities.

A submersible often has very dexterous mobility, provided by marine thrusters or pump-jets.

==Technologies==

Technologies used in the design and construction of submersibles:
*Buoyancy control
*Marine thrusters
*Pressure vessel with external pressure load
*Life support systems
*Through-water communications
*Manipulator arm
*Submarine navigation

Absolute pressure: At sea level the atmosphere exerts a pressure of approximately 1 bar, or 103,000 N/m2. Underwater, the pressure increases by approximately 0.1 bar for every metre of depth. The total pressure at any given depth is the sum of the pressure of the water at that depth (hydrostatic pressure)and atmospheric pressure. This combined pressure is known as absolute pressure, and the relationship is:

Absolute pressure (bar abs) = gauge pressure(bar) + atmospheric pressure (about 1 bar)

To calculate absolute pressure, add the atmospheric pressure to the gauge pressure using the same unit. Working with depth rather than pressure may be convenient in diving calculations. In this context, atmospheric pressure is considered equivalent to a depth of 10 meters.
Absolute depth (m) = gauge depth (m) + 10 m.

Depth measurement: Pressure monitoring devices

The pressure the is more important for structural and physiological reasons than linear depth. Pressure at a given depth may vary due to variations in water density.

To express the linear depth in water accurately, the measurement should be in meters (m). The unit “meters of sea water” (msw) is a by definition a unit for measurement of pressure.

Note: A change in depth of 10 meters for a change in pressure of 1 bar equates to a water density of 1012.72 kg/m3

Single-atmosphere submersibles have a pressure hull with internal pressure maintained at surface atmospheric pressure. This requires the hull to be capable of withstanding the ambient hydrostatic pressure from the water outside, which can be many times greater than the internal pressure.

Ambient pressure submersibles maintain the same pressure both inside and outside the vessel. The interior is air-filled, at a pressure to balance the external pressure, so the hull does not have to withstand a pressure difference.

A third technology is the &quot;wet sub&quot;, which refers to a vehicle that may or may not be enclosed, but in either case, water floods the interior, so underwater breathing equipment is used by the crew. This may be scuba carried by the divers, or a breathing gas supply carried by the vessel.

===Buoyancy===

When an object is immersed in a liquid, it displaces the liquid, pushing it out of the way. 

Once the object is partially immersed, pressure forces exerted on the immersed parts are equal to the weight of water displaced, Consequently, objects submerged in liquids appear to weigh less due to this buoyant force. The relationship between the amount of liquid displaced and the resulting up-thrust is known as Archimedes&#x27; principle, which states:

&quot;when an object is wholly or partially immersed in a liquid, the up-thrust it receives is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced.&quot;

Buoyancy and weight determine whether an object floats or sinks in a liquid. The relative magnitudes of weight and buoyancy determine the outcome, leading to three possible scenarios.

Negative Buoyancy: when the weight of an object is greater than the up-thrust it experiences due to the weight of the liquid displaced, the object sinks.

Neutral Buoyancy: if the weight of an object equals the up-thrust, the object remains stable in its current position, neither sinking or floating.

Positive Buoyancy: when the weight of an object is less than the up-thrust, the object rises and floats. As it reaches the liquid&#x27;s surface, It partly emerges from the liquid, reducing the weight of the displaced liquid and, consequently, the up-thrust. Eventually, the reduced up-thrust balances the weight of the object, allowing it to float in a state of equilibrium.

=== Buoyancy control ===
During underwater operation a submersible will generally be neutrally buoyant, but may use positive or negative buoyancy to facilitate vertical motion. Negative buoyancy may also be useful at times to settle the vessel on the bottom, and positive buoyancy is necessary to float the vessel at the surface. Fine buoyancy adjustments may be made using one or more variable buoyancy pressure vessels as trim tanks, and gross changes of buoyancy at or near the surface may use ambient pressure ballast tanks, which are fully flooded during underwater operations. Some submersibles use high density external ballast which may be released at depth in an emergency to make the vessel sufficiently buoyant to float back to the surface even if all power is lost, or to travel faster vertically.

==Deep-diving crewed submersibles==

Some submersibles have been able to dive to great depths. The bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot; was the first to reach the deepest part of the ocean, nearly below the surface, at the bottom of the Mariana Trench in 1960.

China, with its &quot;Jiaolong&quot; project in 2002, was the fifth country to send a person 3,500 meters below sea level, following the US, France, Russia and Japan. On June 22, 2012, the &quot;Jiaolong&quot; submersible set a deep-diving record for state-owned vessels when the three-person sub descended into the Pacific Ocean.

Among the most well-known and longest-in-operation submersibles is the deep-submergence research vessel , which takes 3 people to depths of up to . Alvin is owned by the United States Navy and operated by WHOI, and as of 2011 had made over 4,400 dives.

James Cameron made a record-setting, crewed submersible dive to the bottom of Challenger Deep, the deepest known point of the Mariana Trench on March 26, 2012. Cameron&#x27;s submersible was named &quot;Deepsea Challenger&quot; and reached a depth of .

DSV Limiting Factor, known as &quot;Bakunawa&quot; since its sale in 2022, is a crewed deep-submergence vehicle (DSV) manufactured by Triton Submarines and owned and operated since 2022 by Gabe Newell&#x27;s Inkfish ocean-exploration research organization. It holds the records for the deepest crewed dives in all five oceans. 
&quot;Limiting Factor&quot; was commissioned by Victor Vescovo for $37 million and operated by his marine research organization, Caladan Oceanic, between 2018-2022. It is commercially certified by DNV for dives to full ocean depth, and is operated by a pilot, with facilities for an observer.

The vessel was used in the Five Deeps Expedition, becoming the first crewed submersible to reach the deepest point in all five oceans. Over 21 people have visited Challenger Deep, the deepest area on Earth, in the DSV. &quot;Limiting Factor&quot; was used to identify the wrecks of the destroyers at a depth of , and at , in the Philippine Trench, the deepest dives on wrecks. It has also been used for dives to the French submarine Minerve (S647) at about in the Mediterranean sea, and at about in the Atlantic.

==Commercial submersibles==
Private firms such as Triton Submarines, LLC. SEAmagine Hydrospace, Sub Aviator Systems (or &#x27;SAS&#x27;), and Netherlands-based U-boat Worx have developed small submersibles for tourism, exploration and adventure travel. A Canadian company in British Columbia called Sportsub has been building personal recreational submersibles since 1986 with open-floor designs (partially flooded cockpits).

A privately owned U.S. company, OceanGate, also participated in building submersibles, though the company fell under scrutiny when their newest submersible imploded underwater with no survivors.

==Marine remotely operated vehicles==
Small uncrewed submersibles called &quot;marine remotely operated vehicles,&quot; (MROVs), or &#x27;remotely operated underwater vehicles&#x27; (ROUVs) are widely used to work in water too deep or too dangerous for divers, or when it is economically advantageous.

Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) repair offshore oil platforms and attach cables to sunken ships to hoist them. Such remotely operated vehicles are attached by an umbilical cable (a thick cable providing power and communications) to a control center on a ship. Operators on the ship see video and/or sonar images sent back from the ROV and remotely control its thrusters and manipulator arm. The wreck of the &quot;Titanic&quot; was explored by such a vehicle, as well as by a crewed vessel.

==Autonomous underwater vehicles==
An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a robot that travels underwater without requiring continuous input from an operator. AUVs constitute part of a larger group of undersea systems known as unmanned underwater vehicles, a classification that includes non-autonomous remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) – controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications an AUV is more often referred to as an unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV). Underwater gliders are a subclass of AUVs.

==Diver lock-out submersible==
Class of submersible which has an airlock and an integral diving chamber from which underwater divers can be deployed, such as:

<text>Austin College is a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and located in Sherman, Texas. Chartered in November 1849, Austin College remains the oldest institution of higher education in Texas to be operating under its original charter and name as recognized by the State Historical Survey Committee. About 1,300 students are enrolled at the college.

==History==

The college was founded on October 13, 1849, in Huntsville, Texas, by the Hampden–Sydney and Princeton-educated missionary Daniel Baker. Signed by Texas Governor George Wood, the charter of Austin College was modeled after those of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.

Baker named the school for the Texas historical figure Stephen F. Austin; the original land was donated by the Austin family. Two other important figures in Texas history, Sam Houston and Anson Jones, served on the board of trustees.

Austin College&#x27;s founding president was Irish-born Presbyterian minister Samuel McKinney, who served as the school&#x27;s president a second time from 1862 to 1871. Under the tenure of the fourth president of Austin College, Samuel Magoffin Luckett, Austin College had several yellow fever epidemics and complications related to the Civil War. The college relocated to Sherman in 1878.

On January 21 of 1913, Old Main was set ablaze and burnt to the ground in a matter of hours. During the fire, the senior class called the student body together and they committed, in writing, to stand by the college after the fire. The faculty also committed to continue college work the next day. The event galvanized the community. Following the fire, the citizens of Sherman raised $50,000 to help the college rebuild.

The college has boasted such guests as Harry Houdini, Harry Blackstone Sr., Madame Schumann-Heink, William Howard Taft, and George H.W. Bush.

In 1994, Oscar Page joined the community as its 14th president. Under his tenure, 1994–2009, Page increased the school&#x27;s endowment by nearly 80%, due in large part to his dedicated fundraising efforts as evidenced by the success of the &quot;Campaign for the New Era;&quot; a total of $120 million were raised and the campaign was heralded as the largest fundraiser in Austin College&#x27;s history. Page orchestrated the construction of Jordan Family Language House, Jerry E. Apple Stadium, the Robert J. and Mary Wright Campus Center, the Robert M. and Joyce A. Johnson &#x27;Roo Suites, and the Betsy Dennis Forster Art Studio Complex; as well as the renovation of the David E. and Cassie L. Temple Center for Teaching and Learning at Thompson House and of Wortham Center, and creation of the John A. and Katherine G. Jackson Technology Center, the Margaret Binkley Collins and William W. Collins, Jr., Alumni Center, and the College Green in Honor of John D. and Sara Bernice Moseley and Distinguished Faculty.

Marjorie Hass joined the campus in 2009 as both its first female and Jewish president. Under her leadership, the college saw the construction of the IDEA Center and two new housing complexes. The IDEA Center is a 103,000 square ft. facility which includes multi-disciplinary and multi-purpose classrooms, laboratories, lecture halls and the largest telescope in the region found in Adams Observatory. It is a LEED Gold certified facility.

==Rankings and reputation==

The U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Austin College 83rd (tied) out of 211 National Liberal Arts Colleges in its 2024-2025 edition.

The college was profiled in all three editions of &quot;Colleges That Change Lives&quot;.

==Academics==
Austin College offers about 35 majors and pre-professional programs for study, and students can also create a specialized major to match their academic interests. The college has a music program, and supports the Austin College A Cappella Choir and the Sherman Symphony Orchestra made up of students and local musicians, and assorted smaller musical ensembles.

Students are required to live on campus for the first three years of their education. 70% of its graduates have at least one international study experience during college, and about 82% of students are involved in research. The college has a 13:1 student to faculty ratio and an average class size of fewer than 25 students.

==Athletics==
Austin College joined the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC) on July 1, 2006, replacing Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Austin College was previously a member of the American Southwest Conference (ASC), Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and Texas Conference. In 2017, the Austin College football team joined the Southern Athletic Association in football, while remaining a member of the SCAC across all other sports.

=== Baseball ===
In 2007, the first year of participating in the SCAC, the Austin College baseball team won the conference tournament, beating Millsaps College 9–7 in the finals. The Roos finished the season with a win–loss record of 22–25. The tournament win was the first ever conference championship for the Roos and the first time the program had ever been in the Regional tournament. Carl Iwasaki was the head coach for the Roos from 2005 until 2010. He won two coach of the year awards, the first in 2006 while the Roos were still in the ASC and the second, coming in 2007 after the Roos had joined the SCAC. Coach Iwasaki was replaced by James Rise for the 2011 season who coached for four seasons. Under Rise, the Roos went 11–24 in 2011, 8–29 in 2012, 12–29 in 2013, and 6–33 in 2014.

<text>The ruddy-breasted crake (Zapornia fusca), or ruddy crake, is a waterbird in the rail and crake family Rallidae.

Its breeding habitat is swamps and similar wet areas across South Asia from the Indian subcontinent east to south China, Japan and Indonesia. It has been recorded as a vagrant from the Australian territory of Christmas Island. It is mainly a permanent resident throughout its range, but some northern populations migrate further south in winter.

This crake nests in a dry location on the ground in marsh vegetation, laying 6-9 eggs.

The ruddy-breasted crake is about 22–23 cm long. The body is flattened laterally to allow easier passage through the reeds or undergrowth. It has long toes and a short tail. Coloring includes a pale brown back and chestnut head and underparts, with white barring on the flanks and undertail. The bill is yellowish, and the eyes, legs, and feet are red.

The sexes are similar, but juveniles are dark brown with some white spotting.

These birds probe in mud or shallow water and also pick up food by sight. They forage for shoots, berries and insects, as well as large snails, which they eat by using their bills to peck through the hard shell.

Ruddy-breasted crakes are territorial, but are quite secretive, hiding amongst grassy shrubs and bushes when disturbed.

<text>The ruddy crake (Laterallus ruber) is a bird in the rail family, Rallidae. Other names the ruddy crake is known by are &quot;red rail&quot;, &quot;ruddy rail&quot; and &quot;red crake&quot;.

==Description==
The ruddy crake can be identified by its ruddy plumage that can vary in shade and gray head with dark brown wings and tail. It is mostly bright chestnut in colour with a paler chin and belly, blackish crown and dark grey ear-coverts. Ruddy crakes are about the size of a sparrow. It is a small crake, 14–16.5 cm in length. Immature ruddy crakes tend to show discoloration on their midline or nape, such as a pale midline or chestnut colored nape. The bill is black, the iris is red and the legs and feet are olive-green. This distinct characteristic of yellow green legs, differentiating it from other small birds. The ruddy crake has a short black conical bill, and it has wide spread feet specifically adapted for wet habitats. Female ruddy crakes are more drab than males, and the males have rusty red plumage on the breast.

== Habitat and distribution ==
The ruddy crake, similar to others in the Rallidae family, prefers wet pastures and marshes, especially the tall grasses. The ruddy crake populates the lowlands of the Caribbean, including areas of the Veracruz east, Yucatan Peninsula, and Honduras. The bird occurs from Mexico south to north-west Costa Rica. It is found in freshwater habitats such as marshes, reedbeds, damp fields and ditches.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the ruddy crake was regarded as the most abundant crake in its range in Mexico, while it is considered rare in Costa Rica. Based on range maps, the breeding distribution is 655,600 kilometers squared. The ruddy crake was listed as possibly extinct by the Asociación Ornitológica de Costa Rica because there were no sightings for two decades. However, in May 2007 a ruddy crake was viewed near the trail by the La Selva Biological Research Station, indicating a widespread range.

== Behavior ==

=== Diet ===
The ruddy crake eats invertebrates and plants near the surface of water, including decaying plants, water snails, water beetles, mosquito larvae, and mayflies in the wetland habitat.

=== Reproduction ===
In crake reproduction, they lay 6–12 eggs in a nest near the water made from plants. The male and female take turns sitting on the eggs for three weeks, and the eggs will hatch over a week-long period. The male will care for the chicks while the female sits on the younger eggs. Once all eggs hatch, both parents feed and guard the chicks. Often, the chicks will be split up between the two parents.

== Conservation ==

=== Population ===
Deforestation and habitat degradation has caused decreases in the population of ruddy crakes, but land preservation by governments and other conservation groups have benefited the species. The Partners in Flight organization estimated the population of the ruddy crakes to be made up of less than 50,000 individuals. The overall population trend, however, is unable to be determined, as the volume of threats and level of threats that the species faces is uncertain.

=== Conservation status ===
The conservation status of the ruddy crake is currently at the level of &quot;Least Concern&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The old Latin name for the ruddy crake was &quot;Corethrura rubra&quot;.

<doc id="575176" wikidata="Q578726" url="?curid=575176" title="Antifungal">
<text>An antifungal medication, also known as an antimycotic medication, is a pharmaceutical fungicide or fungistatic used to treat and prevent mycosis such as athlete&#x27;s foot, ringworm, candidiasis (thrush), serious systemic infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, and others. Such drugs are usually obtained by a doctor&#x27;s prescription, but a few are available over the counter (OTC). The evolution of antifungal resistance is a growing threat to health globally.

== Routes of administration ==

=== Ocular ===
Indicated when the fungal infection is located in the eye. There is currently only one ocular antifungal available: natamycin. However, various other antifungal agents could be compounded in this formulation.

=== Intrathecal ===
Used occasionally when there&#x27;s an infection of the central nervous system and other systemic options cannot reach the concentration required in that region for therapeutic benefit. Example(s): amphotericin B.

=== Vaginal ===
This may be used to treat some fungal infections of the vaginal region. An example of a condition they are sometimes used for is candida vulvovaginitis which is treated with intravaginal Clotrimazole

=== Topical ===

This is sometimes indicated when there&#x27;s a fungal infection on the skin. An example is tinea pedis; this is sometimes treated with topical terbinafine.

=== Oral ===
If the antifungal has good bioavailability, this is a common route to handle a fungal infection. An example is the use of ketoconazole to treat coccidioidomycosis.

=== Intravenous ===
Like the oral route, this will reach the bloodstream and distribute throughout the body. However, it is faster and a good option if the drug has poor bioavailability. An example of this is IV amphotericin B for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis.

==Classes==
The available classes of antifungal drugs are still limited but as of 2021 novel classes of antifungals are being developed and are undergoing various stages of clinical trials to assess performance.

===Polyenes===
A polyene is a molecule with multiple conjugated double bonds. A polyene antifungal is a macrocyclic polyene with a heavily hydroxylated region on the ring opposite the conjugated system. This makes polyene antifungals amphiphilic. The polyene antimycotics bind with sterols in the fungal cell membrane, principally ergosterol. This changes the transition temperature (Tg) of the cell membrane, thereby placing the membrane in a less fluid, more crystalline state. (In ordinary circumstances membrane sterols increase the packing of the phospholipid bilayer making the plasma membrane more dense.) As a result, the cell&#x27;s contents including monovalent ions (K+, Na+, H+, and Cl−) and small organic molecules leak, which is regarded as one of the primary ways a cell dies. Animal cells contain cholesterol instead of ergosterol and so they are much less susceptible. However, at therapeutic doses, some amphotericin B may bind to animal membrane cholesterol, increasing the risk of human toxicity. Amphotericin B is nephrotoxic when given intravenously. As a polyene&#x27;s hydrophobic chain is shortened, its sterol binding activity is increased. Therefore, further reduction of the hydrophobic chain may result in it binding to cholesterol, making it toxic to animals.
* Amphotericin B
* Candicidin
* Filipin – 35 carbons, binds to cholesterol (toxic)
* Hamycin
* Natamycin – 33 carbons, binds well to ergosterol
* Nystatin
* Rimocidin

===Azoles===
Azole antifungals inhibit the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol by inhibiting lanosterol 14α-demethylase. These compounds have a five-membered ring containing two or three nitrogen atoms. The imidazole antifungals contain a 1,3-diazole (imidazole) ring (two nitrogen atoms), whereas the triazole antifungals have a ring with three nitrogen atoms.

====Imidazoles====

* Bifonazole
* Butoconazole
* Clotrimazole
* Econazole
* Fenticonazole
* Isoconazole
* Ketoconazole
* Luliconazole
* Miconazole
* Omoconazole
* Oxiconazole
* Sertaconazole
* Sulconazole
* Tioconazole

====Triazoles====

* Albaconazole
*Cyproconazole
* Efinaconazole
* Epoxiconazole
* Fluconazole
* Isavuconazole
* Itraconazole
* Posaconazole
* Propiconazole
* Ravuconazole
* Terconazole
* Voriconazole

====Thiazoles====

* Abafungin
===Allylamines===
Allylamines inhibit squalene epoxidase, another enzyme required for ergosterol synthesis. Examples include butenafine, naftifine, and terbinafine.

===Echinocandins===
Echinocandins inhibit the creation of glucan in the fungal cell wall by inhibiting 1,3-Beta-glucan synthase:
* Anidulafungin
* Caspofungin
* Micafungin

Echinocandins are administered intravenously, particularly for the treatment of resistant &quot;Candida&quot; species.

===Triterpenoids===
* Ibrexafungerp

===Others===
* Acrisorcin
* Amorolfine – a morpholine derivative used topically in dermatophytosis
* Aurones – possess antifungal properties
* Benzoic acid – has antifungal properties, such as in Whitfield&#x27;s ointment, Friar&#x27;s Balsam, and Balsam of Peru
* Carbol fuchsin (Castellani&#x27;s paint)
* Ciclopirox (ciclopirox olamine) – a hydroxypyridone antifungal that interferes with active membrane transport, cell membrane integrity, and fungal respiratory processes. It is most useful against tinea versicolour.
* Clioquinol
* Coal tar
* Copper(II) sulfate
* Crystal violet – a triarylmethane dye. It has antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic properties and was formerly important as a topical antiseptic.
* Chlorhexidine is a topical antibacterial and antifungal. It is commonly used in hospitals as an antiseptic. It is much more strongly antibacterial than antifungal, requiring at least a 10 times higher concentration to kill yeast compared to gram negative bacteria
* Chlorophetanol
* Diiodohydroxyquinoline (Iodoquinol)
* Flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine) – an antimetabolite pyrimidine analog
* Fumagillin
* Griseofulvin – binds to microtubules and inhibits mitosis
* Haloprogin – discontinued due to the emergence of antifungals with fewer side effects
* Miltefosine works by damaging fungal cell membranes 
* Nikkomycin – blocks formation of chitin present in the cell wall of fungus.
* Orotomide (F901318) – pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor
* Piroctone olamine
* Pentanenitrile
* Potassium iodide – preferred treatment for lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis and subcutaneous zygomycosis (basidiobolomycosis). The mode of action is obscure.
* Potassium permanganate - for use only on thicker, more insensitive skin such as the soles of the feet.
* Selenium disulfide
* Sodium thiosulfate
* Sulfur
* Tolnaftate – a thiocarbamate antifungal, which inhibits fungal squalene epoxidase (similar mechanism to allylamines like terbinafine)
* Triacetin – hydrolysed to acetic acid by fungal esterases
* Undecylenic acid – an unsaturated fatty acid derived from natural castor oil; fungistatic, antibacterial, antiviral, and inhibits &quot;Candida morphogenesis&quot;
* Zinc pyrithione

==Side effects==
Incidents of liver injury or failure among modern antifungal medicines are very low to non-existent. However, some can cause allergic reactions in people.

There are also many drug interactions. Patients must read in detail the enclosed data sheet(s) of any medicine. For example, the azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole can be both substrates and inhibitors of the P-glycoprotein, which (among other functions) excretes toxins and drugs into the intestines. Azole antifungals are also both substrates and inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 family CYP3A4, causing increased concentration when administering, for example, calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants, chemotherapeutic drugs, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides and SSRIs.

Before oral antifungal therapies are used to treat nail disease, a confirmation of the fungal infection should be made. Approximately half of suspected cases of fungal infection in nails have a non-fungal cause. The side effects of oral treatment are significant and people without an infection should not take these drugs.

Azoles are the group of antifungals which act on the cell membrane of fungi. They inhibit the enzyme 14-alpha-sterol demethylase, a microsomal CYP, which is required for the biosynthesis of ergosterol for the cytoplasmic membrane. This leads to the accumulation of 14-alpha-methylsterols resulting in impairment of function of certain membrane-bound enzymes and disruption of close packing of acyl chains of phospholipids, thus inhibiting growth of the fungi. Some azoles directly increase permeability of the fungal cell membrane.

== Resistance ==
Antifungal resistance is a subset of antimicrobial resistance, that specifically applies to fungi that have become resistant to antifungals. Resistance to antifungals can arise naturally, for example by genetic mutation or through aneuploidy. Extended use of antifungals leads to the development of antifungal resistance through various mechanisms.

Some fungi (e.g. Candida krusei and fluconazole) exhibit intrinsic resistance to certain antifungal drugs or classes, whereas some species develop antifungal resistance to external pressures. Antifungal resistance is a One Health concern, driven by multiple extrinsic factors, including extensive fungicidal use, overuse of clinical antifungals, environmental change and host factors.

Like resistance to antibacterials, antifungal resistance can be driven by antifungal use in agriculture. Currently there is no regulation on the use of similar antifungal classes in agriculture and the clinic.

The emergence of &quot;Candida auris&quot; as a potential human pathogen that sometimes exhibits multi-class antifungal drug resistance is concerning and has been associated with several outbreaks globally. The WHO has released a priority fungal pathogen list, including pathogens with antifungal resistance.

<text>Marimekko Corporation () is a Finnish textiles, clothing, and home furnishings company founded by Viljo and Armi Ratia in Helsinki in 1951. Marimekko made important contributions to fashion in the 1960s. It is particularly noted for its brightly colored printed fabrics and simple styles, used both in women&#x27;s garments and in home furnishings.

Two designers in particular, Vuokko Nurmesniemi, with bold stripes, and Maija Isola, with large simple flowered prints such as the Unikko poppy, created hundreds of distinctive patterns and helped to make Marimekko a household name across the world.

== Etymology ==

The co-founder, Armi Ratia, first considered &quot;Armi&quot; as the company&#x27;s name, but it was already registered. Her middle name was Maria, shortened to &quot;Mari&quot;; her husband Viljo thought of different names for women&#x27;s clothing. In her home town of Koivisto, Armi heard people talking about dresses (), and so she came to the name Marimekko.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===



Marimekko was founded in 1951 by Viljo and Armi Ratia, after the Viljo&#x27;s oil-cloth factory project failed and was converted to a garment plant. Armi asked some artist friends to apply their graphic designs to textiles. To show how the fabric could be used, the company then designed and sold a line of simple dresses using their fabric. When Finland&#x27;s leading industrial designer Timo Sarpaneva invited the company to present a fashion show (albeit canceled at short notice) at the 1957 Triennale in Milan, it was an early recognition of fashion as an industrial art and of Marimekko&#x27;s key role in shaping it to that point. The garments were eventually showcased in the nearby Rinascente upscale department store by display manager Giorgio Armani.

=== Pioneering design ===

Two pioneering designers set the tone for Marimekko: Vuokko Nurmesniemi in the 1950s and Maija Isola in the 1960s. Nurmesniemi designed the simply striped red and white &quot;Jokapoika&quot; shirt in 1956. Isola designed the iconic &quot;Unikko&quot; (poppy) print pattern in 1964. Marimekko&#x27;s bold fabrics and bright, simple design strongly influenced late 20th-century taste. Many of the early Marimekko designs, including Isola&#x27;s &quot;Unikko&quot;, remain in production in the 2010s.

=== Commercial growth ===

Marimekko spread to America in the 1960s. It was introduced to the United States by the architect Benjamin C. Thompson, who featured them in his Design Research stores. They were made famous in the United States by future first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who bought eight Marimekko dresses which she wore throughout the 1960 United States presidential campaign.

By 1965, the company employed over 400 staff, and the company was in every aspect of fine design, from fabrics to toys and dinnerware. The firm even completely equipped small houses with furnishings. In 1985, the company was sold to Amer-yhtymä. In the early 1990s, Marimekko was in a bad financial condition and close to bankruptcy. It was bought from Amer by Kirsti Paakkanen, who introduced new business methods in the company and helped to revive its popularity.

Later in the 1990s Marimekko achieved publicity in the hit TV series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. The fictional main character of the series, sex-and-relationship columnist Carrie Bradshaw, wore a Marimekko bikini on season 2 and then a Marimekko dress. In season 5 the series introduced tablecloths with Marimekko prints.

In 2005, Marimekko&#x27;s revenue had quadrupled since Paakkanen&#x27;s purchase, and its net income had grown 200-fold. Paakkanen remained CEO of Marimekko and owned 20% of the company via her business Workidea. In 2007, Paakkanen announced she would gradually hand over her ownership to Mika Ihamuotila as CEO and biggest owner of the company. By 2011 there were 84 stores across the world.

Marimekko products are made in China, India, Thailand, Portugal, Lithuania and other countries. Fabrics are printed in Marimekko&#x27;s textile factory in Helsinki, but are not made in Finland.
The company celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2021 by publishing the book &quot;Marimekko: The Art of Printmaking&quot;.

== Logo ==

The logo of Marimekko has been in use since 1954. Armi Ratia wanted the logo to be simple and timeless. Graphic designer Helge Mether-Borgström used modified versions of classic Olivetti typewriter letters to create the logo.

== Reception ==

Cindy Babski wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;There was never any doubt about what the inside label would say. The clothes and fabrics, with their striking design and splashes of bold color, were clearly Marimekko. But for people of a certain generation—those who came of age in the 1960s—they represented more than just a brand name: They conjured up an image and an era.&quot;

In 2007, Heidi Avellan wrote in the Swedish newspaper &quot;Sydsvenskan&quot; that Marimekko was no longer a &quot;statement, just as T-shirts with revolutionary Che Guevara or Palestinian scarves rarely express any political awareness. Marimekko is paper napkins and rubber boots&quot;. She wrote that Marimekko &quot;began with the colourfully striped shirt, &quot;Jokapoika&quot; which Vuokko Nurmesniemi designed in 1956&quot;, which became the symbol for new radicalism in academia.

=== Plagiarism controversy ===
In 2013, allegations were raised accusing Marimekko of plagiarism. In house designer Kristina Isola later admitted copying design elements from 1963 painting by Ukrainian artist Maria Primachenko. By the time the accusations were raised, the design had been painted on the body of one of Finnair&#x27;s planes, and the National Museum of Ukraniain Folk Art, which held the copyright to Primachenko&#x27;s design, pursued legal action over the incident. Finnair moved to repaint the plane as quickly as possible.

After the incident was raised, other works by Marimekko were identified to be alleged to have strong similarities to works previously released by artists Maria Jauhiainen, Markus Lepo and Heljä Liukko-Sundström. Five designs came under suspicion, with Marimekko defending against some claims, and trying to settle others. In the case of Lepo&#x27;s design, Marimekko&#x27;s CEO later apologised for misleading consumers about the originality of the designs.

<text>The slaty-legged crake or banded crake (Rallina eurizonoides) is a waterbird in the rail and crake family, Rallidae.

==Distribution and habitat==
Its breeding habitat is swamps and similar wet areas in well-wooded country across south Asia east from India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to the Philippines and Indonesia. The rails are mainly permanent residents throughout their range, but some northern populations migrate further south in winter.

==Description==
The -legged crake is about 25 cm long. Its body is flattened laterally to allow easier passage through the undergrowth. It has long toes and a short tail. Colouring includes a brown back, chestnut head and breast, and strong black-and-white barring on the flanks, belly and undertail. The throat is white, the bill is yellowish, and the legs are green. Sexes are similar; juveniles are dark brown above and below, although they have the belly barring and white throat.

==Behaviour==
Slaty-legged crakes are territorial, but are quite secretive, hiding in bushes when disturbed. They probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They forage for berries and insects on the ground, or clambering through bushes and undergrowth. They nest in a dry location on the ground or low bush usually near forest paths and forest streams, laying 4–8 eggs. A study conducted in Nilambur, Kerala in southern India shows that the incubation period was about 20 days.

<doc id="575207" wikidata="Q144927" url="?curid=575207" title="1862 Apollo">
<text>1862 Apollo is a stony asteroid, approximately 1.5 kilometers in diameter, classified as a near-Earth object (NEO). It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory on 24 April 1932, but lost and not recovered until 1973.

It is the namesake and the first recognized member of the Apollo asteroids, a subgroup of NEOs which are Earth-crossers, that is, they cross the orbit of the Earth when viewed perpendicularly to the ecliptic plane (crossing an orbit is a more general term than actually intersecting it). In addition, since Apollo&#x27;s orbit is highly eccentric, it crosses the orbits of Venus and Mars and is therefore called a Venus-crosser and Mars-crosser as well.

Although Apollo was the first Apollo asteroid to be discovered, its official IAU-number (1862) is higher than that of some other Apollo asteroids such as 1566 Icarus, because it was a lost asteroid for more than 40 years and other bodies were numbered in the meantime. The analysis of its rotation provided observational evidence of the YORP effect.

It is named after the Greek god Apollo. He is the god of the Sun, child of Zeus and Leto, after which the minor planets 5731 Zeus and 68 Leto are named.

== Satellite ==
On November 4, 2005, it was announced that an asteroid moon, or satellite of Apollo, had been detected by radar observations from Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico, October 29 – November 2, 2005. The announcement is contained in the International Astronomical Union Circular (IAUC) 8627. The satellite is only across and orbits Apollo just away from the asteroid itself. From the surface of Apollo, S/2005 (1862) 1 would have an angular diameter of about 2.0835 degrees.

== Potentially hazardous object ==
1862 Apollo is a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) because its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) is less than 0.05 AU and its diameter is greater than 150 meters. Apollo&#x27;s Earth MOID is . Its orbit is well-determined for the next several hundred years. On 17 May 2075 it will pass from Venus.

<doc id="575216" wikidata="Q19811" url="?curid=575216" title="Garage sale">
<text>A garage sale (also known as a yard sale, tag sale, moving sale and by many other names) is an informal event for the sale of used goods by private individuals, in which sellers are not required to obtain business licenses or collect sales tax (though, in some jurisdictions, a permit may be required).

Typically the goods in a garage sale are unwanted items from the household with its owners conducting the sale. The conditions of the goods vary, but they are typically usable. Some of these items are offered for sale because the owner does not want or need the item to minimize their possessions or to raise funds. Popular motivations for a garage sale are for &quot;spring cleaning&quot;, preparing to move home or earning extra money. The seller&#x27;s items are displayed to the passers-by or those responding to signs, flyers, classified ads or newspaper ads. In some cases, local television stations will broadcast a sale on a local public channel. The venue at which the sale is conducted is typically a garage; other sales are conducted at a driveway, carport, front yard or inside a house. Some vendors, known as &quot;squatters&quot;, will set up in a high-traffic area rather than on their own property.

Items typically sold at garage sales include old clothing, books, toys, household decorations, lawn and garden tools, sports equipment, and board games. Larger items like furniture and occasionally home appliances are also sold. Garage sales occur most frequently in rural and suburban areas on weekends with good weather conditions, and usually have designated hours for the sale. Buyers who arrive before the hours of the sale to review the items are known as &quot;early birds&quot; and are often professional restorers or resellers. Such sales also attract people who are searching for bargains or for rare and unusual items. Bargaining, also known as haggling, on prices is routine, and items may or may not have price labels affixed. Some people buy goods from these sales to restore them for resale.

Some jurisdictions require that the home owners obtain a permit (which may require a fee), stating the date(s) on which the sale will take place (with allowances in the event of bad weather conditions). The jurisdiction may also place restrictions on the sale, such as the number of sales in a year a person can have (so as to avoid a person running a business without licenses and without collecting sales taxes), where signs may be placed in and around the neighborhood, and even where on the owner&#x27;s premises a sale may take place.

==Advertising for a garage sale==

Advertising for the event of a garage sale is typically done by posting a sign, usually made from cardboard or plastic, in a public location. Signs are posted with the intent that people passing by will take note of the event, time, and location of the garage sale. In many cases, signs may feature an arrow or some other means of expressing the direction of the event.

In addition to signs, many people advertise their garage sales in the newspaper in a dedicated section or on websites.

==Special community sales==
In some areas, garage sales have taken on a special meaning to a community and have become events of special local significance. Large areas of a community then hold a communal garage sale involving numerous families at the same time.

The Highway 127 Corridor Sale, promoted as &quot;The World&#x27;s Longest Yard Sale&quot;, encourages private individuals and professional vendors to conduct simultaneous yard sales along a corridor spanning five U.S. states. The headquarters is located at Fentress County Chamber of Commerce in Jamestown, Tennessee. The sale officially starts the first Thursday of August. However, many sellers in the area will start the weekend before.

Running east to west, the Coast-to-Coast yard sale runs along U.S. Route 50 in May of each year. Though not as popular as &quot;The World&#x27;s Longest Yard Sale&quot;, the US 50 Coast-to-Coast sale is in its 16th year.

During the second Saturday in August, a stretch of U.S. Route 11 becomes a continuous yard sale from Stephens City, Virginia&#x27;s Newtown Commons south to New Market, Virginia. The event, in its ninth year, is sponsored by the Shenandoah County Chamber Advisory Group, five chambers of commerce, and two town governments. In years past, the Yard Crawl has attracted people from as far away as Canada.

In Bondi Beach, Australia, the first Garage Sale Trail took place as part of the Sizzle Bondi Community Festival on May 9, 2010, during which 126 garage sales occurred simultaneously. The Garage Sale Trail was designed to reduce the amount of goods dumped instead of sold and re-used.
Since the first event, the Garage Sale Trail has won a Green Globes award for Media Excellence,
and the &quot;Wentworth Courier&quot;″s Business Achiever award. In July 2010, organisers of the Garage Sale Trail announced their intention to take the Garage Sale Trail national and involve thirty local councils across Australia&#x27;s states and territories potentially making it the largest garage sale in the world.

The now semi-annual City Wide Garage Sale was first held in October 1990 in El Cerrito, California. Local resident and reuse advocate, Marianne Hegeman proposed the citywide garage sale to facilitate garage inspections in the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. City Wide Garage Sales have been replicated in other cities including Albany, California; Mountain View, California; and Eagle Mountain, Utah.

Informal sales also occur across the country. One such example is in the Bismarck-Mandan area. Coinciding with the United Tribes International Pow-wow, it is a tradition for the weekend following Labor Day to be the area&#x27;s biggest garage sale weekend due to the influx of visitors in the area. On any given year, total garage sales number at least 500, while Fargo, North Dakota surpasses Bismarck as the state&#x27;s largest city. The only state event that is bigger is the North Dakota State Fair held in Minot, North Dakota, during the last week of July.

==In popular culture==
The cultural phenomenon of garage and yard sales in the United States has been examined by several artists. The Thunderground Film production &quot;Zen and the Art of Yardsailing&quot; is a documentary film produced in 2004 that covered aspects of finding bargains as well as the cutthroat practices of professional resellers and the previously-noted &quot;early birds&quot;. New Jersey artist Robert A. Emmons, Jr.&#x27;s short documentary film &quot;Yard Sale&quot;, released in 2006, examines the American practice of buying and selling goods in one&#x27;s front yard and the sociological impact of such activities.

<text>An estate sale or estate liquidation is a sale or auction to dispose of a substantial portion of the materials owned by a person who is recently deceased or who must dispose of their personal property to facilitate a move.

==Reasons for an estate sale==
The most common reasons for an estate sale is the death of the property owner, and the consequent need to quickly liquidate the deceased&#x27;s belongings for any number of reasons:
*The survivors/heirs may have no interest in the bulk of the personal belongings left by the deceased
*The survivors/heirs may simply lack space to keep the belongings
*The survivors/heirs cannot agree to the disposition of tangible property, and thus a court has ordered the goods to be sold, with the proceeds to be divided among the survivors (after payment of the estate&#x27;s debts)
*The will of the deceased may have mandated a sale of assets, or the assets may have to be sold in order to pay all or part of the estate&#x27;s debts

An estate sale may also occur because the property owner will be moving or has moved into a new residence where they will be unable to keep their property, such as an assisted living facility, a retirement community, a rest home, or the home of a family member, or in the event of divorce, foreclosure, or relocation.

==Conduct==
Estate sales are usually conducted by a professional, for a percentage of the revenues. The liquidator may also charge the estate for the costs to give the sale, including advertising, marketing, research, labor, security, refreshments and other fees incurred in giving a successful sale.

Depending on the jurisdiction, estate sales run by professional firms may be required to obtain a permit for the sale (as may also be required to conduct a garage sale) and to collect sales tax on the items sold (or otherwise determine the tax-exempt status of a buyer), and may also be limited as to advertising (for example, on the number and placement of signs along streets).

The presence of a professional liquidator may be necessary because the scope of the process is likely to be overwhelming to the survivors. The liquidator has knowledge and experience with pricing items, and general value knowledge of all types of household goods and personal property value, and the specialist&#x27;s experience in disposing of unsold goods in an unsentimental manner after the sale. These professionals often take a percentage of the net proceeds, anywhere from 25% to 50%.

===Admittance procedure===
Since many people may attend, not all people may be able to fit into the confines of the house at the same time.

The crowd thus may be controlled by a numbered sign-up sheet by the door or the issuance of &#x27;numbers.&#x27; Typically the estate sale company will hand out numbered pieces of paper early on the first day to the people waiting in line. This is both a courtesy so that people may wait in their vehicles during inclement weather until the posted start time, and a way to prevent a &#x27;mad rush&#x27; for the door when the sale begins. The holder of the sale will then call for the first 10 or 20 numbers. These people are admitted and they get first choice at the items. As they eventually leave, the next numbers are called and admitted. This way the company can control the number of people inside what is typically a cramped house.

Also, due to the possibility of expensive, fragile items being sold, small children are usually not permitted inside the house.

====Street numbers====
Typically one will see in an advertisement of an estate sale, &quot;street numbers honored&quot; or &quot;street numbers not honored.&quot; Street numbers are slips of paper that are generated by customers, usually dealers. These &quot;street&quot; numbers are then exchanged for the real, official numbered slips of paper handed out by the estate sale company.

Liquidators can also choose to not honor any street numbers handed out by customers. In cases such as this, the liquidator will have wording in their ad such as &quot;street numbers not honored&quot; or &quot;only our numbers honored&quot;. Liquidators will typically do this in order to avoid any customer problems or issues that arise since the street number system is open to abuse.

====Sign-up sheet====
Another method to control entry to the sale is a sign-up sheet, which can be as simple as a blank piece of paper taped to the front door of the estate. On this paper, customers write their names on the sheet, and when the sale begins, customers are called in to enter the sale, starting with the first name on the sheet. Like street numbers, this is also open to abuse.
