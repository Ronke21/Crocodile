<text>The Miꞌkmaq language ( ), or , is an Eastern Algonquian language spoken by nearly 11,000 Miꞌkmaq in Canada and the United States; the total ethnic Miꞌkmaq population is roughly 20,000. The native name of the language is , or (in some dialects). The word is a plural word meaning &#x27;my friends&#x27; (singular ); the adjectival form is .

==Phonology==
The phonemic inventory of Miꞌkmaq is shown below.

===Vowels===
===Consonants===
The sounds of Miꞌkmaq can be divided into two groups: obstruents () and sonorants ( and all vowels). 

The obstruents have a wide variety of pronunciations. When they are located word-initially or next to another obstruent, they are voiceless . However, when they are located between sonorants, they are voiced, and appear as . When the plosives and affricate are located word-finally, they may be aspirated and appear as . An example of each kind of pronunciation is given below.

Miꞌkmaq distinguishes between long and short vowels and consonants, the latter indicated in Listuguj by doubling the consonant. Beyond expanding in length, long consonants add a schwa when they precede other consonants. For instance, compare , written in Listuguj as (&#x27;flow away&#x27;) with , written in Listuguj as (&#x27;stick into&#x27;); or, , written in Listuguj as (&#x27;hoist&#x27;), with , written in Listuguj as (&#x27;loud&#x27;).

Listuguj orthography occasionally begins words with consonant clusters, as in (&#x27;ocean&#x27;) and (&#x27;ice&#x27;). However, such clusters are pronounced over separate syllables, with a schwa preceding the cluster; for instance, is pronounced while is pronounced . On the other hand, word-final clusters, such as in (&#x27;instigate&#x27;) are pronounced over a single syllable: compare the pronunciation of , , with (&#x27;taste&#x27;), .

==Grammar==

===Syntax===
Miꞌkmaq uses free word order, based on emphasis rather than a traditionally fixed order of subjects, objects and verbs. For instance, the sentence &quot;I saw a moose standing right there on the hill&quot; could be stated &quot; (I saw him/there/on the hill/right-there/a moose/he was standing) or &quot; (I saw him/there/a moose/on the hill/right-there/he was standing); the latter sentence puts emphasis on the moose by placing (&#x27;moose&#x27;) earlier in the utterance. Miꞌkmaq, as a polysynthetic language, has verbs which usually contain the sentence&#x27;s subject and object: for instance, the aforementioned translates to &#x27;I saw him&#x27;.

While it is thus difficult to classify Miꞌkmaq under traditional word order categories such as SVO or SOV, a more fixed aspect in the language comes in the morphology of its verbs. Certain areas of internal morphology of verbs in Miꞌkmaq have regular placement: for instance, when the aspect of a verb is included, it appears as the first prefix, while the negative marker always appears directly after the verb root. An example for both of these instances can be seen in the Miꞌkmaq verb (), translated as &#x27;they cannot get out&#x27;: the prefix marks the verb as being in the completive aspect, whereas the negative marker, &quot;w&quot;, appears directly after the verb root (&#x27;the two move&#x27;). However, these solidly placed elements of verbs are paired with markers that can appear throughout the word, depending again on emphasis; animacy in particular can appear fluidly throughout verbs. In short, while a few specific aspects of Miꞌkmaq can be predicted, its syntax in general is largely free and dependent on context.

Miꞌkmaq verbs are also marked for tense.

===Nouns===
Nouns in Miꞌkmaq are either animate or inanimate. This is a common feature among Algonquian languages. The verbs change depending on the noun&#x27;s animacy. For example: 

 – &#x27;I see (inanimate noun)&#x27;

 – &#x27;I see (animate noun)&#x27;

==Writing system==

Miꞌkmaq is written using a number of Latin alphabets based on ones devised by missionaries in the 19th century. Previously, the language was written in Miꞌkmaq hieroglyphic writing, a script of partially native origin. The Francis-Smith orthography used here was developed in 1974 and was adopted as the official orthography of the Míkmaq Nation in 1980. It is the most widely used orthography and is that used by Nova Scotian Mikmaq and by the Míkmaq Grand Council. It is quite similar to the &quot;Lexicon&quot; orthography, differing from it only in its use of the straight apostrophe or acute accent instead of the colon to mark vowel length.

When the Francis-Smith orthography was first developed, the straight apostrophe (often called a &quot;tick&quot;) was the designated symbol for vowel length, but since software applications incorrectly autocorrected the tick to a curly apostrophe, a secondary means of indicating vowel length was formally accepted, the acute accent. The barred-i for schwa is sometimes replaced by the more common circumflex-i . 

In Listuguj orthography, an apostrophe marks long vowels as well as schwa, and the letter is used instead of the letter .

The 19th-century Pacifique orthography omits and , using and for these. It also ignores vowel length. The 19th-century orthography of Silas Tertius Rand, using characters from Isaac Pitman&#x27;s Phonotypic Alphabet, is also given in the table below; this orthography is more complex than the table suggests, particularly as far as vowel quantity and quality is concerned, employing various letters such as 〈a〉, 〈à〉, , , , , , , , 〈u〉, etc.


==Number system==

===1–10===
Miꞌkmaq uses a decimal numeral system. Every multiple-digit number is formed by using one of the first nine numerals as a prefix or a preceding word, as seen in the number for ten, , a combination of the prefix (derived from ) and the root , meaning ten (the pattern can be seen in for 20, for 30, etc.) While 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 all use a single word containing a prefix, the tens between 60 and 90 use the numeral as a preceding word to a separate word meaning ten, : for instance, 60 is written as .

Numbers between the tens are stated by multiple-word phrases, beginning with the ten-based root number, such as , followed by (meaning &#x27;and&#x27; or &#x27;also&#x27;) and ending with one of the nine numerals: for instance, the number 28 is constructed as , or literally &#x27;twenty and eight&#x27;.

For numbers beyond 99, Miꞌkmaq uses a pattern similar to that of 60 to 99, with numeral words preceding separate roots that identify higher numbers (such as , meaning &#x27;hundred&#x27;, or meaning &#x27;thousand&#x27;); for instance, 300 is written as , while 2,000 is written as . The exceptions to that pattern are the numbers 100 and 1,000, which are simply the roots and , respectively. Similarly to digits between the tens, the connecting word is used between hundreds and tens, or thousands and hundreds: for example, the number 3,452 is written as .

On top of the basic structure, numbers in Miꞌkmaq must agree with the animacy of whatever they are counting: for instance, when speaking of two people, is used, as opposed to the number used for two days, . The suffix to denote the counting of animate subjects and the suffix to denote the counting of inanimate subjects are common, but animacy-marking suffixes are somewhat fluid and vary by number and dialect. 

==Language revitalization efforts and teaching==
The Miꞌkmaq language possesses a degree of endangerment level of vulnerable under the UNESCO Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger scale. A level of vulnerable means the language may not be used consistently and instead the dominant language English is opted for. This also means it is still somewhat commonly spoken by younger generations or children of Miꞌkmaq people. A lack of fluent Miꞌkmaq speakers is due to the cultural genocide performed by the Canadian government through the introduction of the Canadian Indian residential school system. These schools under the notation of assimilation, forced Indigenous children to reject their cultural identity and language. These schools resulted in a significant number of children physically and mentally abused and without the means to speak their mother tongue.

Wagmatcook, Cape Breton, is undergoing significant efforts to revitalize the language. The community created a variety of children&#x27;s books suited for a range of ages to develop Miꞌkmaq language skills as children mature. The use of Miꞌkmaq immersion schools in this area also increased the proficiency in the language for children and an improved attachment to their Indigenous identity. The immersion schools allowed children to learn their mother tongue, which increases the number of fluent speakers while still obtaining the dominant language. Community member educators also participated in a program to obtain a Certificate in Aboriginal Literacy Education that increased their fluency in the language.

Cape Breton University&#x27;s Unamaꞌki College specializes &quot;in Miꞌkmaq history, culture and education&quot;. As of 2013, &quot;it has some 250 aboriginal students&quot;.

Also as of 2013, Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia&#x27;s Miꞌkmaq Burial Grounds Research and Restoration Association has about forty students in its Miꞌkmaq language revitalization classes, and Miꞌkmaq greetings are becoming more common in public places.

In 2021, Emma Stevens, a member of the Eskasoni First Nation, recorded a cover version of the Beatles song &quot;Blackbird&quot; in the language to raise awareness and help in its revitalization efforts.

==History and related languages==
Miꞌkmaq is one of the Algic languages, a family that once spanned from a small portion of California across Central Canada, the Midwestern United States, and the northeastern coast of North America. Within this family, Miꞌkmaq is part of the Eastern Algonquian subgroup spoken largely along the Atlantic coast. It is closely related to several extant languages, such as Malecite-Passamaquoddy, Massachusett and Munsee as well as extinct languages like Abenaki and Unami. Beyond having a similar language background and sharing close geographic proximity, the Miꞌkmaq notably held an alliance with four other tribes within the Eastern Algonquian language group known as the Wabanaki Confederacy: in short, a history of long-term language contact has existed between Miꞌkmaq and its close linguistic relatives.

Miꞌkmaq has many similarities with its fellow Eastern Algonquian languages, including multiple word cognates: for instance, compare the Miꞌkmaq word for &#x27;woman&#x27;, , to the Maliseet , or the varying related words for the color &#x27;white&#x27;: in Miꞌkmaq, in Maliseet, in Munsee, in Abenaki and in Unami. Even outside of the Eastern Algonquian subgroup, there exist similar cognates within the larger Algic family, such as the Cree and the Miami-Illinois .

Like many Native American languages, Miꞌkmaq uses a classifying system of animate versus inanimate words. The animacy system in general is common, but the specifics of Miꞌkmaq&#x27;s system differ even from closely related Algic languages. For instance, in Wampanoag, the word for &#x27;Sun&#x27;, , is inanimate, but the word for &#x27;Earth&#x27;, , is animate, a fact used by some scholars to claim that the Wampanoag people were aware of the Earth&#x27;s rotation around an unmoving Sun; however, in Miꞌkmaq, both the word for &#x27;Sun&#x27;, , and the word for &#x27;Earth&#x27;, , are animate, and parallel cultural knowledge regarding astronomy cannot be gleaned through the language. Much like grammatical gender, the core concept of animacy is shared across similar languages while the exact connotations animacy has within Miꞌkmaq are unique.

Many Acadian French and Chiac words are rooted in the Miꞌkmaq language, due to the Acadians and Miꞌkmaq living together prior to the Expulsion of the Acadians and the British colonization of Acadia; in French-speaking areas, traces of Miꞌkmaq can also be found largely in geographical names within regions historically that were occupied by the Miꞌkmaq people, including Quebec and several towns in Nova Scotia such as Antigonish and Shubenacadie. Moreover, several Miꞌkmaq words have made their way into colonizing languages: the English words &quot;caribou&quot; and &quot;toboggan&quot; are borrowings from Miꞌkmaq. The name &quot;caribou&quot; was probably derived from the Miꞌkmaq word or meaning &#x27;the one who paws&#x27;. Marc Lescarbot in his publication in French in 1610 used the term &quot;caribou&quot;. Silas Tertius Rand translated the Miꞌkmaq word as &#x27;caribou&#x27; in his Miꞌkmaq-English dictionary (Rand 1888:98). 

The aforementioned use of hieroglyphic writing in pre-colonial Miꞌkmaq society shows that Miꞌkmaq was one of the few Native American languages to have a writing system before European contact.

Linguist Peter Bakker identified two Basque loanwords in Miꞌkmaq, presumably because of extensive trade contact between Basque sailors and Native Americans in the 16th century. The overall friendly exchanges starting in mid-16th century between the Miꞌkmaqs and the Basque whalers provided the basis for the development of an Algonquian–Basque pidgin with a strong Miꞌkmaq imprint, which was recorded to be still in use in the early 18th century.

<text>James Howard, 3rd Earl of Suffolk, [[Order of the Bath|KB]] (10 February 1606/1607December 1688), and 3rd Baron Howard de Walden (1619–1688), eldest son of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk. Howard was honoured with knighthood in the Order of the Bath in 1626, and was a joint-commissioner of the parliament to Charles I the same year. He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War, and was a courtier after the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. He was lord-lieutenant of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire and gentleman of the bedchamber, 1660–1682.

==Biography==
At the coronation of Charles I on 2 February 1626 Howard was created K.B., and in February 1639, as Lord Walden, became leader of a troop of volunteer horse for the king&#x27;s army. 

On 3 June 1640 Howard succeeded his father, Theophilus as the 3rd Earl of Suffolk, and on the 16th of the same month was sworn joint lord-lieutenant of Suffolk. The parliament nominated him lord-lieutenant of that county on 28 February 1642. On 28 December 1643 he received a summons to attend the king&#x27;s Parliament at Oxford, and on 7 July 1646 was appointed joint commissioner from the parliament to the king at Newcastle.

Acting on a report from the Committee of Safety, in September 1647, the commons decided, but went no further, to impeach Howard, together with six other peers, of high treason. On 8 September 1653 Howard was sworn as high steward of Ipswich. 

After the Restoration Howard became lord-lieutenant of Suffolk, and of Cambridgeshire on 25 July 1660. From 18 to 24 April 1661 he acted as Earl Marshal of England for the coronation of Charles II. In the same year he became colonel of the Suffolk Militia Horse. On 28 September 1663 he was created M.A. of Oxford, and M.A. of Cambridge on 6 September 1664. He was also appointed governor of Landguard Fort, Essex, gentleman of the bedchamber to the king on 4 March 1665, and keeper of the king&#x27;s house at Audley End, Essex, in March 1667. He commanded the Suffolk Militia during the Battle of Landguard Fort on 2 July 1667. He was appointed joint commissioner for the office of Earl Marshal of England on 15 June 1673, colonel commandant of three regiments of Cambridgeshire Militia in 1678, and was hereditary visitor of Magdalene College, Cambridge. In March 1681 he was discharged from the lord-lieutenancy of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, and from attendance in the king&#x27;s bedchamber

Howard died in December 1688, and was buried on 16 January 1689 at Saffron Walden, Essex. On his death the earldom passed to his brother George (died 1691). The barony Howard de Walden fell into abeyance for nearly a century, until it was called out of abeyance for a descendant of his elder daughter Lady Essex Howard, later Baroness Griffin.

==Family==
On 1 December 1640 (later in the same year that he became 3rd Earl of Suffolk) Howard married Lady Susannah Rich (died 15 May 1649), daughter of Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland, and with her had a daughter Essex. 

In about February 1650, Howard married for a second time, Barbara (died 13 December 1681), daughter of Sir Edward Villiers, and widow of Richard Wenman and latterly Sir Richard Wentworth. The second Lady Suffolk died on 13 December 1681, leaving a mutual daughter, his second child, Lady Elizabeth Howard, groom of the stool to the queen. 

After December 1681 and before 8 May 1682 Lord Suffolk married Anne (died October 1720), eldest daughter of Robert Montagu, 3rd Earl of Manchester with whom he had no children. 

==Land and buildings==
Lord Suffolk owned central London property including Suffolk House and appears to have left his Jacobean house, Audley End, Essex, built by the 1st Earl, to the descendants of his elder daughter.

<text>Jean Tiberi (born 30 January 1935) is a French politician who was mayor of Paris from 22 May 1995 to 24 March 2001. , he was mayor of the 5th arrondissement of Paris and deputy to the French National Assembly from the second district of Paris.

Of Corsican descent, Tiberi first entered the National Assembly in August 1968 as the replacement for René Capitant, who was appointed to the government as Minister of Justice. He was re-elected in the 1973 election, serving until early 1976, when he was appointed to the government as Secretary of State in charge of Food Industries, under the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Industry and Research. He served in that position until August 1976, after which he returned to the National Assembly in a by-election in November 1976 to replace Monique Tisne. He has been re-elected to the National Assembly in every election since then.

He was Mayor of the 5th arrondissement of Paris from March 1983 to May 1995, when he became Mayor of Paris. After serving as Mayor of Paris, he was again elected as Mayor of the 5th arrondissement in 2001.

Jean Tiberi and his wife Xavière Tiberi were involved in corruption scandals in the Paris region in which Mr Tiberi was convicted of vote-rigging and given a ten-month suspended prison sentence.

In 1998, a justice-ordered search of Jean and Xavière Tiberi&#x27;s apartment on the Place du Panthéon showed that they possessed two pistols whose authorization had expired since 1991 and five ammunition boxes. They were not prosecuted in exchange for the destruction of the weapons.

The above actions are sometimes referred to by the press as Corsican mores.

Along with Jean-Pierre Soisson and Didier Julia, Jean Tiberi was among the longest-serving members of the National Assembly, in which he has served 10 terms and 44 years. He did not run for reelection in 2012.

Friend of Jean-Edern Hallier, he has been Cercle InterHallier member since 2019.

<doc id="573744" wikidata="Q1062129" url="?curid=573744" title="Tohoku University">
<text>is a public research university in Sendai, Miyagi, Japan. It is colloquially referred to as &#x27; or &#x27;.

Established in 1907 as the third of the Imperial Universities, after the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University, it initially focused on science and medicine, later expanding to include humanities studies as well.

In 2016, Tohoku University had 10 faculties, 16 graduate schools and 6 research institutes, with a total enrollment of 17,885 students. The university&#x27;s three core values are &quot;Research First (研究第一主義),&quot; &quot;Open-Doors (門戸開放),&quot; and &quot;Practice-Oriented Research and Education (実学尊重).&quot;

==History==
On 22 June 1907 (Mēji 40), Tohoku Imperial University (東北帝國大學, Tōhoku teikoku daigaku) was established by the Meiji government as the third Imperial University of Japan, after Tokyo Imperial University (1877) and Kyoto Imperial University (1897). From its inception, it advocated &#x27;Open-door&#x27; policies, becoming the first university in Japan to accept both female students in 1913, and foreign students.

It was not until 1911 that teaching and research activities started in Sendai. When the university was founded in 1907 it only had one faculty (college), the College of Agriculture, in Sapporo, Hokkaido. This college, originally founded in 1875 as the , precedes the establishment of the university, and in 1918, it became independent to form another imperial university, Hokkaido Imperial University, in its own right. The School of Science was established in Sendai in 1911, followed by the School of Medicine (formerly Sendai Medical College) in 1915, the Faculty of Engineering in 1919, and the Faculty of Law and Literature in 1922.

In 1947, during the post-war educational reform, the university dropped the word &#x27;imperial&#x27; along with other imperial universities, and assumed its current name, Tohoku University. It was also this year that the university&#x27;s academic scope came to cover agriculture again, with the establishment of a new Faculty of Agriculture in Sendai. In 1949, the Faculty of Law and Literature was split to form independent faculties of Law, Literature, and Economics. A Faculty of Education was added in 1949, Dentistry in 1965, and Pharmacy in 1972. Tohoku has been a National University Corporation since April 2004.

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake===
Subsequent to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the university was declared closed until further notice, but with a tentative re-opening date of the end of the following April. The Aobayama, Katahira, Amamiya, and Kawauchi campuses are all at least from the ocean, towards the mountains, and therefore suffered no damage resulting from the tsunami. No deaths or serious injuries within the faculty and student body were reported on campus grounds. However, earthquake damage lead to the closure of 27 buildings and caused millions of dollars of damage to equipment. Classes have resumed normally since early May 2011 and plans for restoring, reinforcing or replacing damaged buildings are underway.

<text>Xavière Tiberi is the spouse of the former mayor of Paris Jean Tiberi. She is mostly known for being involved in corruption scandals in the Paris region.

Xavière Tiberi received 200,000 French Francs for a report on francophonie for the general counsel of the Essonne &quot;département&quot;. This 36-page long report, possibly written after the payment as a justification, was extremely poorly written (contained numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes, for instance). 

In 1998, a justice-ordered search of Jean and Xavière Tiberi&#x27;s apartment on the Place du Panthéon showed that they possessed illegal firearms. They were not prosecuted in exchange for the destruction of the weapons. 

The above actions are sometimes referred to by the press as Corsican mores .

On 9 November 2004, Xavière Tibéri and Aurélie Filippetti, an elected official from the French Green Party, wrangled after a tense district council meeting. Each of them accused the other one of assault or threats. Mrs. Tibéri had a head trauma, which she claimed was caused by Mrs. Filipetti pushing her over; she filed a complaint.

Xavière Tiberi was caricatured on &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;info&quot; as an aggressive, dishonest, vulgar and greedy woman.

Friend of Jean-Edern Hallier, she has been Cercle InterHallier member since 2019.

<text>In the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong, the United States and the European Union, a green paper is a tentative government report and consultation document of policy proposals for debate and discussion. A green paper represents the best that the government can propose on the given issue, but, as it remains uncommitted, it can without loss of face leave its final decision open until it has been able to consider the public reaction to it. Green papers may result in the production of a white paper. They may be seen as grey literature.

==Canada==
A green paper in Canada, like a white paper, is an official government document. Green papers tend to be statements not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussion. They are produced early in the policy-making process, while ministerial proposals are still being formulated. Many white papers in Canada have been, in effect, green papers, while at least one green paper—that on immigration and population in 1975—was released for public debate after the government had already drafted legislation.

==United Kingdom==
Similarly, in the UK, green papers are official consultation documents produced by the government for discussion both inside and outside Parliament, for instance when a government department is considering introducing a new law.

The term &quot;green paper&quot; has been said to originate with the publication in 1941 by Herwald Ramsbotham, UK president of the board of education, of plans for educational reform in a green binding, which became known as the &quot;Green Book&quot;. According to the BBC, UK green papers are printed on paper of a pale green colour.

==European Union==
A green paper released by the European Commission is a discussion document intended to stimulate debate and launch a process of consultation, at European level, on a particular topic. A green paper usually presents a range of ideas and is meant to invite interested individuals or organizations to contribute views and information. It may be followed by a white paper, an official set of proposals that is used as a vehicle for their development into law.

==Examples==
===Discussion of defence policy in Australia, 2000===
A major review of defence policy in Australia culminated in a white paper issued in December 2000. Prior to this, a discussion paper was released in June 2000. This discussion paper was in nature what is known as a green paper (and was sometimes referred to as such).

===Copyright in the knowledge economy, 2008===
The purpose of the 2008 EU green paper on copyright was to foster a debate on how knowledge for research, science and education can best be disseminated in the online environment. The green paper, which was published on 16 July 2008, aimed to set out a number of issues connected with the role of copyright in the &quot;knowledge economy&quot; and intended to launch a consultation on these issues (see this document). The EU asked for answers and comments to be submitted up to 30 November 2008.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Hisaishi was born in Nakano, Nagano, Japan, as . He started learning the violin at the age of four using the Suzuki method, and began watching hundreds of movies each year with his father. He attended the Kunitachi College of Music in 1969, where he majored in music composition, and collaborated with minimalist artists as a music engraver.

In 1974 Hisaishi wrote music for the anime series &quot;Gyatoruzu&quot;, and composed some of his other early works, under his given name. He also composed for &quot;Sasuga no Sarutobi&quot; (Academy of Ninja) and &quot;Futari Daka&quot; (A Full Throttle).

In the 1970s, Hisaishi&#x27;s compositions were influenced by Japanese popular music, electronic music and New Age music, and by the Japanese electronic band Yellow Magic Orchestra. He developed his music from minimalist ideas and expanded toward orchestral work. Around 1975, he presented his first public performance. His first album, &quot;MKWAJU&quot;, was released in 1981; his second, the electropop-minimalist &quot;Information&quot;, was released a year later. His first major anime scores were for &quot;Hajime Ningen Gyatoruz&quot; (1974) and &quot;Robokko Beeton&quot; (1976).

As he became better known, Hisaishi formulated an alias inspired by American musician and composer Quincy Jones: the same kanji in &quot;Hisaishi&quot; can also be pronounced &quot;Kuishi,&quot; which is close to the way &quot;Quincy&quot; is transliterated into Japanese as &quot;Kuinshī&quot;; and &quot;Joe&quot; came from &quot;Jones&quot;.

He also scored the sci-fi adventure series &quot;Mospeada&quot; (1983). Other films he scored included, &quot;Birth (Bâsu)&quot; (1984), &quot;Arion&quot; (1986), &quot;Robot Carnival&quot; (1987), &quot;Totoro&quot; (1988), &quot;Crest of the Royal Family&quot; (1988), &quot;Venus Wars&quot; (1989), &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; (1989) and &quot;Ocean Heaven&quot; (2010). He also did theme-song arrangements and composed other anime opening, closing, and insert title theme songs such as &quot;Mahō Shōjo Lalabel&quot; (1980), &quot;Hello! Sandybell&quot; (1981), &quot;Meiken Jolie&quot; (1981), &quot;Voltron&quot; (1981), &quot;Ai Shite Knight&quot; (1983), &quot;Creamy Mami, the Magic Angel: Curtain Call&quot; (1986), and &quot;Kimagure Orange Road: The Movie&quot; (1988).

<text>The Antarctic Peninsula, known as O&#x27;Higgins Land in Chile and Tierra de San Martin in Argentina, and originally as Graham Land in the United Kingdom and the Palmer Peninsula in the United States, is the northernmost part of mainland Antarctica.


The Antarctic Peninsula is part of the larger peninsula of West Antarctica, protruding from a line between Cape Adams (Weddell Sea) and a point on the mainland south of the Eklund Islands. Beneath the ice sheet that covers it, the Antarctic Peninsula consists of a string of bedrock islands; these are separated by deep channels whose bottoms lie at depths considerably below current sea level. They are joined by a grounded ice sheet. Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of South America, is about away across the Drake Passage.

The Antarctic Peninsula is in area and 80% ice-covered.

The marine ecosystem around the western continental shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has been subjected to rapid climate change. Over the past 50 years, the warm, moist maritime climate of the northern WAP has shifted south. This climatic change increasingly displaces the once dominant cold, dry continental Antarctic climate. This regional warming has caused multi-level responses in the marine ecosystem such as increased heat transport, decreased sea ice extent and duration, local declines in ice-dependent Adélie penguins, increase in ice-tolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins, accelerated greening due to the spread of moss, alterations in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition as well as changes in krill recruitment, abundance and availability to predators.

The Antarctic Peninsula is currently dotted with numerous research stations, and nations have made multiple claims of sovereignty. The peninsula is part of disputed and overlapping claims by Argentina, Chile, and the United Kingdom. None of these claims have international recognition and, under the Antarctic Treaty System, the respective countries do not attempt to enforce their claims. The British claim, however, is recognised by Australia, France, New Zealand, and Norway. Argentina has the most bases and personnel stationed on the peninsula.

==History==

===Discovery and naming===
The most likely first sighting of the Antarctic Peninsula, and therefore also of the whole Antarctic mainland, was on 27 January 1820 by an expedition of the Imperial Russian Navy led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen. But the party did not recognize as the mainland what they thought was an icefield covered by small hillocks.

Three days later, on 30 January 1820, Edward Bransfield and William Smith, with a British expedition, were the first to chart part of the Antarctic Peninsula. This area was later to be called Trinity Peninsula and is the extreme northeast portion of the peninsula. The next confirmed sighting was in 1832 by John Biscoe, a British explorer, who named the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula as Graham Land.

The first European to land on the continent is also disputed. A 19th-century seal hunter, John Davis, was almost certainly the first. But, sealers were secretive about their movements and their logbooks were deliberately unreliable, to protect any new sealing grounds from competition.

Between 1901 and 1904, Otto Nordenskjöld led the Swedish Antarctic Expedition, one of the first expeditions to explore parts of Antarctica. They landed on the Antarctic Peninsula in February 1902, aboard the ship &quot;Antarctic,&quot; which sank not far from the peninsula. All crew were rescued by an Argentine ship. The British Graham Land expedition between 1934 and 1937 carried out aerial surveys using a de Havilland Fox Moth aircraft, and concluded that Graham Land was not an archipelago but a peninsula.

Agreement on the name &quot;Antarctic Peninsula&quot; by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names and UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1964 resolved a long-standing difference over the use of the United States&#x27; name &quot;Palmer Peninsula&quot; or the British name &quot;Graham Land&quot; for this geographic feature. This dispute was resolved by making Graham Land the part of the Antarctic Peninsula northward of a line between Cape Jeremy and Cape Agassiz; and Palmer Land the part southward of that line, which is roughly 69° S. Palmer Land is named for the United States seal hunter Nathaniel Palmer. The Chilean name for the feature, O&#x27;Higgins Land, is in honor of Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, the Chilean patriot and Antarctic visionary. Most other Spanish-speaking countries call it &quot;la Península Antártica&quot;, though Argentina also officially refers to this as &quot;Tierra de San Martín&quot;; as of 2018 Argentina has more bases and personnel in the peninsula than any other nation.

Other portions of the peninsula are named by and after the various expeditions that discovered them, including the Bowman, Black, Danco, Davis, English, Fallières, Nordenskjöld, Loubet, and Wilkins Coasts.

===Research stations===
The first Antarctic research stations were established during World War II by a British military operation, Operation Tabarin.

The 1950s saw a marked increase in the number of research bases as Britain, Chile and Argentina competed to make claims over the same area. Meteorology and geology were the primary research subjects.

Since the peninsula has the mildest climate in Antarctica, the highest concentration of research stations on the continent can be found there, or on the many nearby islands, and it is the part of Antarctica most often visited by tour vessels and yachts. Occupied bases include Base General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Riquelme, Bellingshausen Station, Carlini Base, Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station, Palmer Station, Rothera Research Station, and San Martín Base. Today on the Antarctic Peninsula there are many abandoned scientific and military bases. Argentina&#x27;s Esperanza Base was the birthplace of Emilio Marcos Palma, the first person to be born in Antarctica.

===Oil spill===
The grounding of the Argentine ship the ARA &quot;Bahía Paraíso&quot; and subsequent oil spill occurred near the Antarctic Peninsula in 1989.

==Geology==
Antarctica was once part of the Gondwana supercontinent. Outcrops from this time include Ordovician and Devonian granites and gneiss found in the Scar Inlet and Joerg Peninsula, while the Carboniferous-Triassic Trinity Peninsula Group are sedimentary rocks that outcrop in Hope Bay and Prince Gustav Channel. Ring of Fire volcanic rocks erupted in the Jurassic, with the breakup of Gondwana, and outcrop in eastern Graham Land as volcanic ash deposits. Volcanism along western Graham Land dates from the Cretaceous to present times, and outcrops are found along the Gerlache Strait, the Lemaire Channel, Argentine Islands, and Adelaide Island. These rocks in western Graham Land include andesite lavas and granite from the magma, and indicate Graham Land was a continuation of the Andes. This line of volcanoes are associated with subduction of the Phoenix Plate. Metamorphism associated with this subduction is evident in the Scotia Metamorphic Complex, which outcrops on Elephant Island, along with Clarence and Smith Islands of the South Shetland Islands. The Drake Passage opened about 30 Ma as Antarctica separated from South America. The South Shetland Island separated from Graham Land about 4 Ma as a volcanic rift formed within the Bransfield Strait. Three dormant submarine volcanoes along this rift include The Axe, Three Sisters, and Orca. Deception Island is an active volcano at the southern end of this rift zone. Notable fossil locations include the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Fossil Bluff Group of Alexander Island, Early Cretaceous sediments in Byers Peninsula on Livingston Island, and the sediments on Seymour Island, which include the Cretaceous extinction.

==Geography==


The peninsula is very mountainous, its highest peaks rising to about . Notable peaks on the peninsula include Deschanel Peak, Mounts Castro, Coman, Gilbert, Jackson, William, Owen, Scott, and Hope, which is the highest point at , Mount William, Mount Owen and Mount Scott. These mountains are considered to be a continuation of the Andes of South America, with a submarine spine or ridge connecting the two. This is the basis for the position advanced by Chile and Argentina for their territorial claims. The Scotia Arc is the island arc system that links the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula to those of Tierra del Fuego.

There are various volcanoes in the islands around the Antarctic Peninsula. This volcanism is related to extensional tectonics in Bransfield Rift to the west and Larsen Rift to the east.

The landscape of the peninsula is typical Antarctic tundra. The peninsula has a sharp elevation gradient, with glaciers flowing into the Larsen Ice Shelf, which experienced significant breakup in 2002. Other ice shelves on the peninsula include the George VI, Wilkins, Wordie and Bach Ice Shelves. The Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf lies to the east of the peninsula.

Islands along the peninsula are mostly ice-covered and connected to the land by pack ice. Separating the peninsula from nearby islands are the Antarctic Sound, Erebus and Terror Gulf, George VI Sound, Gerlache Strait and the Lemaire Channel. The Lemaire Channel is a popular destination for tourist cruise ships that visit Antarctica. Further to the west lies the Bellingshausen Sea and in the north is the Scotia Sea. The Antarctic Peninsula and Cape Horn create a funneling effect, which channels the winds into the relatively narrow Drake Passage.

Hope Bay, at , is near the northern extremity of the peninsula, Prime Head, at 63°13′S. Near the tip at Hope Bay is Sheppard Point. The part of the peninsula extending northeastwards from a line connecting Cape Kater to Cape Longing is called the Trinity Peninsula. Brown Bluff is a rare tuya and Sheppard Nunatak is found here also. The Airy, Seller, Fleming and Prospect Glaciers form the Forster Ice Piedmont along the west coast of the peninsula. Charlotte Bay, Hughes Bay and Marguerite Bay are all on the west coast as well.

On the east coast is the Athene Glacier; the Arctowski and Åkerlundh Nunataks are both just off the east coast. A number of smaller peninsulas extend from the main Antarctic Peninsula, including Hollick-Kenyon Peninsula and Prehn Peninsula at the base of the Antarctic Peninsula. Also located here are the Scaife Mountains. The Eternity Range is found in the middle of the peninsula. Other geographical features include Avery Plateau, the twin towers of Una Peaks.

==Climate==

Because the Antarctic Peninsula, which reaches north of the Antarctic Circle, is the most northerly part of Antarctica, it has the mildest climates within this continent. Its climate is therefore classified as a tundra, rather than an ice cap. Its temperatures are warmest in January, averaging , and coldest in June, averages from . Its west coast from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula south to 68° S, which has a maritime Antarctic climate, is the mildest part of the Antarctic Peninsula. Within this part of the Antarctic Peninsula, temperatures exceed for 3 or 4 months during the summer, and rarely fall below during the winter. Farther south along the west coast and the northeast coast of the peninsula, mean monthly temperatures exceed for only one or two months of summer and average around in winter. The east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula south of 63° S is generally much colder, with mean temperatures exceeding for at most one month of summer, and winter mean temperatures ranging from . The colder temperatures of the southeast, Weddell Sea side, of the Antarctic Peninsula are reflected in the persistence of ice shelves that cling to the eastern side.
Precipitation varies greatly within the Antarctic Peninsula. From the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula to 68° S, precipitation averages per year. A good portion of this precipitation falls as rain during the summer, on two-thirds of the days of the year, and with little seasonal variation in amounts. Between about 68° S and 63° S on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula and along its northeast coast, precipitation is or less with occasional rain. Along the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula south of 63° S, precipitation ranges from . In comparison, the subantarctic islands have precipitation of per year and the dry interior of Antarctica is a virtual desert with only precipitation per year.

The climate in and around the Antarctic Peninsula is changing dramatically in 2024. The most recent temperature recorded was 10°C, which is higher than the peninsula region&#x27;s average and deviates from the patterns of typical temperatures. The peninsula is getting very much affected by these sudden climate changes. In past years, researchers have seen northwesterly winds over the peninsula, and it is proven that this is one of the reasons for the peninsula constantly melting and snow sublimation in 2024. Researchers are observing similar situations in 2024. Melting events have been observed on the eastern and western sides of the Peninsula in February and March. All three are contributing to the melting of ice in several Antarctic Peninsula areas, such as Larsen C and B. Furthermore, data from NASA&#x27;s research indicates that the ice sheet is melting nonstop.

==Climate change==
Because of issues concerning global climate change, the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent parts of the Weddell Sea and its Pacific continental shelf have been the subject of intensive geologic, paleontologic, and paleoclimatic research by interdisciplinary and multinational groups over the last several decades. The combined study of the glaciology of its ice sheet and the paleontology, sedimentology, stratigraphy, structural geology, and volcanology of glacial and nonglacial deposits of the Antarctic Peninsula has allowed the reconstruction of the paleoclimatology and prehistoric ice sheet fluctuation of it for over the last 100 million years. This research shows the dramatic changes in climate, which have occurred within this region after it reached its approximate position within the Antarctic Circle during the Cretaceous Period.

The Fossil Bluff Group, which outcrops within Alexander Island, provides a detailed record, which includes paleosols and fossil plants, of Middle Cretaceous (Albian) terrestrial climates. The sediments that form the Fossil Bluff Group accumulated within a volcanic island arc, which now forms the bedrock backbone of the Antarctic Peninsula, in prehistoric floodplains and deltas and offshore as submarine fans and other marine sediments. As reflected in the plant fossils, paleosols, and climate models, the climate was warm, humid, and seasonally dry. According to climate models, the summers were dry and winters were wet. The rivers were perennial and subject to intermittent flooding as the result of heavy rainfall.

Warm high-latitude climates reached a peak during the mid-Late Cretaceous Cretaceous Thermal Maximum. Plant fossils found within the Late Cretaceous (Coniacian and Santonian-early Campanian) strata of the Hidden Lake and Santa Maria formations, which outcrop within James Ross, Seymour, and adjacent islands, indicate that this emergent volcanic island arc enjoyed warm temperate or subtropical climates with adequate moisture for growth and without extended periods of below freezing winter temperatures.

After the peak warmth of the Cretaceous thermal maximum the climate, both regionally and globally, appears to have cooled as seen in the Antarctic fossil wood record. Later, warm high-latitude climates returned to the Antarctic Peninsula region during the Paleocene and early Eocene as reflected in fossil plants. Abundant plant and marine fossils from Paleogene marine sediments that outcrop on Seymour Island indicate the presence of cool and moist, high-latitudes environment during the early Eocene.

Detailed studies of the paleontology, sedimentology, and stratigraphy of glacial and nonglacial deposits within the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent parts of the Weddell Sea and its Pacific continental shelf have found that it has become progressively glaciated as the climate of Antarctica dramatically and progressively cooled during the last 37 million years. This progressive cooling was contemporaneous with a reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. During this climatic cooling, the Antarctic Peninsula was probably the last region of Antarctica to have been fully glaciated. Within the Antarctic Peninsula, mountain glaciation was initiated during the latest Eocene, about 37–34 . The transition from temperate, alpine glaciation to a dynamic ice sheet occurred about 12.8 . At this time, the Antarctic Peninsula formed as the bedrock islands underlying it were overridden and joined by an ice sheet in the early Pliocene about 5.3–3.6 . During the Quaternary period, the size of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has fluctuated in response to glacial–interglacial cycles. During glacial epochs, this ice sheet was significantly thicker than it is currently and extended to the edge of the continental shelves. During interglacial epochs, the West Antarctica Ice Sheet was thinner than during glacial epochs and its margins lay significantly inland of the continental margins.

During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 to 18,000 years ago, the ice sheet covering the Antarctic Peninsula was significantly thicker than it is now. Except for a few isolated nunataks, the Antarctic Peninsula and its associated islands were completely buried by the ice sheet. In addition, the ice sheet extended past the present shoreline onto the Pacific outer continental shelf and completely filled the Weddell Sea up to the continental margin with grounded ice.

The deglaciation of the Antarctic Peninsula largely occurred between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago as an interglacial climate was established in the region. It initially started about 18,000 to 14,000 years ago with retreat of the ice sheet from the Pacific outer continental shelf and the continental margin within the Weddell Sea. Within the Weddell Sea, the transition from grounded ice to a floating ice shelf occurred about 10,000 years ago. The deglaciation of some locations within the Antarctic Peninsula continued until 4,000 to 3,000 years ago. Within the Antarctic Peninsula, an interglacial climatic optimum occurred about 3,000 to 5,000 years ago. After the climate optimum, a distinct climate cooling, which lasted until historic times, occurred.

The Antarctic Peninsula is a part of the world that is experiencing extraordinary warming. Each decade for the last five, average temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula have risen by . Ice mass loss on the peninsula occurred at a rate of 60 billion tons / year in 2006, with the greatest change occurring in the northern tip of the peninsula. Seven ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula have retreated or disintegrated in the last two decades. Research by the United States Geological Survey has revealed that every ice front on the southern half of the peninsula experienced a retreat between 1947 and 2009. According to a study by the British Antarctic Survey, glaciers on the peninsula are not only retreating but also increasing their flow rate as a result of increased buoyancy in the lower parts of the glaciers. Professor David Vaughan has described the disintegration of the Wilkins Ice Shelf as the latest evidence of rapid warming in the area. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been unable to determine the greatest potential effect on sea level rise that glaciers in the region may cause.

==Flora and fauna==

The coasts of the peninsula have the mildest climate in Antarctica and moss and lichen-covered rocks are free of snow during the summer months, although the weather is still intensely cold and the growing season very short. The plant life today is mainly mosses, lichens and algae adapted to this harsh environment, with lichens preferring the wetter areas of the rocky landscape. The most common lichens are &quot;Usnea&quot; and &quot;Bryoria&quot; species. Antarctica&#x27;s two flowering plant species, the Antarctic hair grass (&quot;Deschampsia antarctica&quot;) and Antarctic pearlwort (&quot;Colobanthus quitensis&quot;) are found on the northern and western parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, including offshore islands, where the climate is relatively mild. Lagotellerie Island in Marguerite Bay is an example of this habitat.

&quot;Xanthoria elegans&quot; and &quot;Caloplaca&quot; are visible crustose lichens seen on coastal rocks.

Antarctic krill are found in the seas surrounding the peninsula and the rest of the continent. The crabeater seal spends most of its life in the same waters feeding on krill. Bald notothen is a cryopelagic fish that lives in sub-zero water temperatures around the peninsula. Vocalizations of the sei whale can be heard emanating from the waters surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula.

Whales include the Antarctic minke whale, dwarf minke whale, and the killer whale.

The animals of Antarctica live on food they find in the sea—not on land—and include seabirds, seals and penguins. The seals include: leopard seal (&quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;), Weddell seal (&quot;Leptonychotes weddellii&quot;), the huge southern elephant seal (&quot;Mirounga leonina&quot;), and crabeater seal (&quot;Lobodon carcinophagus&quot;).

Penguin species found on the peninsula, especially near the tip and surrounding islands, include the chinstrap penguin, emperor penguin, gentoo penguin and the Adélie penguin. Petermann Island is the world&#x27;s southernmost colony of gentoo penguins. The exposed rocks on the island is one of many locations on the peninsula that provides a good habitat for rookeries. The penguins return each year and may reach populations of more than ten thousand. Of these the most common on the Antarctic Peninsula are the chinstrap and gentoo, with the only breeding colony of emperor penguins in West Antarctica an isolated population on the Dion Islands, in Marguerite Bay on the west coast of the peninsula. Most emperor penguins breed in East Antarctica.

Seabirds of the Southern Ocean and West Antarctica found on the peninsula include: southern fulmar (&quot;Fulmarus glacialoides&quot;), the scavenging southern giant petrel (&quot;Macronectes giganteus&quot;), Cape petrel (&quot;Daption capense&quot;), snow petrel (&quot;Pagodroma nivea&quot;), the small Wilson&#x27;s storm-petrel (&quot;Oceanites oceanicus&quot;), imperial shag (&quot;Phalacrocorax atriceps&quot;), snowy sheathbill (&quot;Chionis alba&quot;), the large south polar skua (&quot;Catharacta maccormicki&quot;), brown skua (&quot;Catharacta lönnbergi&quot;), kelp gull (&quot;Larus dominicanus&quot;), and Antarctic tern (&quot;Sterna vittata&quot;). The imperial shag is a cormorant which is native to many sub-Antarctic islands, the Antarctic Peninsula and southern South America.

Also present are the Antarctic petrel, Antarctic shag, king penguin, macaroni penguin, and Arctic tern.

==Threats and preservation==
Although this very remote part of the world has never been inhabited and is protected by the Antarctic Treaty System, which bans industrial development, waste disposal and nuclear testing, there is still a threat to these fragile ecosystems from increasing tourism, primarily on cruises across the Southern Ocean from the port of Ushuaia, Argentina.

==Paleoflora and paleofauna==
A rich record of fossil leaves, wood, pollen, and flowers demonstrates that flowering plants thrived in subtropical climates within the volcanic island arcs that occupied the Antarctic Peninsula region during the Cretaceous and very early Paleogene periods. The analysis of fossil leaves and flowers indicates that semitropical woodlands, which were composed of ancestors of plants that live in the tropics today, thrived within this region during a global thermal maximum with summer temperatures that averaged .

The oldest fossil plants come from the middle Cretaceous (Albian) Fossil Bluff Group, which outcrop along the edge of Alexander Island. These fossils reveal that at this time the forests consisted of large conifers, with mosses and ferns in the undergrowth. The paleosols, in which trees are rooted, have physical characteristics indicative of modern soils that form under seasonally dry climates with periodic high rainfall. Younger Cretaceous strata, which outcrop within James Ross, Seymour, and adjacent islands, contain fossil plants of Late Cretaceous angiosperms with leaf morphotypes that are similar to those of living families such as Sterculiaceae, Lauraceae, Winteraceae, Cunoniaceae, and Myrtaceae. They indicate that the emergent parts of the volcanic island arc, the eroded roots of which now form the central part of the Antarctic Peninsula, were covered by either warm temperate or subtropical forests.

These fossil plants are indicative of tropical and subtropical forest at high paleolatitudes during the Middle and Late Cretaceous, which grew in climates without extended periods of below freezing winter temperatures and with adequate moisture for growth. The Cretaceous strata of James Ross Island also yielded the dinosaur genus &quot;Antarctopelta&quot;, which was the first dinosaur fossil to be found on Antarctica.

Paleogene and Early Eocene marine sediments that outcrop on Seymour Island contain plant-rich horizons. The fossil plants are dominated by permineralized branches of conifers and compressions of angiosperm leaves, and are found within carbonate concretions. These Seymour Island region fossils date to about 51.5–49.5  and are dominated by leaves, cone scales, and leafy branches of Araucarian conifers, very similar in all respects to living &quot;Araucaria araucana&quot; (monkey puzzle) from Chile. They suggest that the adjacent parts of the prehistoric Antarctic Peninsula were covered by forests that grew in a cool and moist, high-latitude environment during the early Eocene.

During the Cenozoic climatic cooling, the Antarctic Peninsula was the last region of Antarctica to have been fully glaciated according to current research. As a result, this region was probably the last refugium for plants and animals that had inhabited Antarctica after it separated from the Gondwanaland supercontinent.

Analysis of paleontologic, stratigraphic, and sedimentologic data acquired from the study of drill core and seismic acquired during the Shallow Drilling on the Antarctic Continental Shelf (SHALDRIL) and other projects and from fossil collections from and rock outcrops within Alexander, James Ross, King George, Seymour, and South Shetland Islands has yielded a record of the changes in terrestrial vegetation that occurred within the Antarctic Peninsula over the course of the past 37 million years.

This research found that vegetation within the Antarctic Peninsula changed in response to a progressive climatic cooling that started with the initiation of mountain glaciation in the latest Eocene, about 37–34 . The cooling was contemporaneous with glaciation elsewhere in Antarctica and a reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Initially, during the Eocene, this climate cooling resulted in a decrease in diversity of the angiosperm-dominated vegetation that inhabited the northern Antarctic Peninsula. During the Oligocene, about 34–23 , these woodlands were replaced by a mosaic of southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;) and conifer-dominated woodlands and tundra as the climate continued to cool. By middle Miocene, 16–11.6 , a tundra landscape completely replaced any remaining woodlands. At this time, woodlands became completely extirpated from the Antarctic Peninsula and all of Antarctica. A tundra landscape probably persisted until about 12.8  when the transition from a temperate, alpine glaciation to a dynamic ice sheet occurred. Eventually, the Antarctic Peninsula was overridden by an ice sheet, which has persisted without any interruption to this day, in the early Pliocene, about 5.3–3.6 .

<text>Lafayette College is a private liberal arts college in Easton, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1826 by James Madison Porter and other citizens in Easton, the college first held classes in 1832. The founders voted to name the college after General Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution.

Located on College Hill in Easton, the campus is in the Lehigh Valley, about west of New York City and north of Philadelphia. Lafayette College guarantees campus housing to all enrolled students. The college requires students to live in campus housing for their first three years unless approved for residing at home as a commuter. Seniors can apply to live off campus. 

The student body, consisting entirely of undergraduates, comes from 46 U.S. states and territories and nearly 60 countries. Students at Lafayette have access to more than 250 clubs and organizations, including athletics, fraternities and sororities, special interest groups, community service clubs, and honor societies.

==History==
===Founding===
A group of Easton, Pennsylvania residents, led by James Madison Porter, son of General Andrew Porter of Norristown, Pennsylvania, met on December 27, 1824, at White&#x27;s Tavern to discuss founding a college in town. The recent visit of General Lafayette to New York during his grand tour of the US in 1824 and 1825 prompted the founders to name the college after the renowned French military officer, a hero of the American Revolutionary War, as &quot;a testimony of respect for [his] talents, virtues, and signal services... in the great cause of freedom&quot;.

The group established a 35-member board of trustees, a system of governance that continues at the college to the present. They selected Porter, lawyer Jacob Wagener, and Yale-educated lawyer Joel Jones to come up with an education plan. The charter gained state approval from the legislature and, on March 9, 1826, Pennsylvania Governor John Andrew Shulze. Along with establishing Lafayette as a liberal arts college, the charter provided for religious equality among professors, students, and staff.

The board of trustees met on May 15, 1826, for the election of officers: Thomas McKeen as Treasurer, Joel Jones as Secretary, and James Madison Porter as the first president of the college. Over the next few years, the board met several times to discuss property and funding for the college&#x27;s start-up. Six years after the first meeting, Lafayette began to enroll students.

The college opened on May 1, 1829, with four students under the guidance of John Monteith. At the start of the next year, George Junkin, a Presbyterian minister, was elected first official president of the college. He moved the all-male Manual Labor Academy of Pennsylvania from Germantown (near Philadelphia) to Easton to assist with the physical construction of the college&#x27;s first building. Its first two professors were Charles F. McCay and James I. Coon. Classes began on May 9, 1832, with instruction of 43 students in a rented farmhouse on the south bank of the Lehigh River. Junkin supported colonization of Liberia by ex-slaves from the United States. He proposed Lafayette for educating free African Americans for missionary work in the new American colony established by the American Colonization Society. Between 1832 and 1844, ten black students were enrolled at Lafayette, four of whom later served as missionaries in Liberia.

During the college&#x27;s first years, students were required to work in the fields and workshops to allow the college to earn money to support its programs. This manual labor was retained as part of the curriculum until 1839, as the college was focused on preparing students for Military and Civil Engineering. Later that year, Lafayette purchased property on what is now known as &quot;College Hill&quot; – nine acres of elevated land across Bushkill Creek. The college&#x27;s first building was constructed two years later on the current site of South College.

A dispute, largely related to the financial well-being of the school, between Porter and Junkin led to the latter man&#x27;s resignation from the presidency in 1841. The next decade was fraught with financial difficulties and a rotation of four new presidents of the college, including the return of Junkin for a brief period. In an effort to restore financial order to the institution, the trustees explored the potential of adding a religious affiliation.

In 1849, Lafayette College became affiliated with the Presbyterian Church via the Synod of Philadelphia. By relinquishing their control, the college was able to collect $1000 a year from the Presbyterian Church Board of Education as regularly as the latter could pay it. In the time from 1855 to 1856, Lafayette had a peak enrollment of 112 students in total. The class of 1857, a close-knit group of 27 men, worked in secrecy to establish charters in national fraternities, thus founding the first Greek fraternities at Lafayette College. These fraternities remained secret until 1869, as they were initially discouraged by the college authorities.

===World War I===
In preparation for United States entry into the World War I, which had involved European nations since 1914, Lafayette announced that current students would be awarded their degrees &quot;in absentia&quot; if they enlisted or went to work on farms to support the war effort. Professor Beverly Kunkel organized The Lafayette Ambulance United, Section 61, United States Army Ambulance Corps. During the summer of 1917, MacCracken arranged to adapt the campus as a war camp for the War Department. Lafayette remained a war camp until January 2, 1919, when the regular course of study was re-established there.

On December 16, 1925, the nation&#x27;s largest fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega, was founded at Lafayette.

===Great Depression===

Between 1930 and 1934, during the Great Depression, the number of students declined dramatically. The college created new scholarships and scholarship loans to enable more students to attend. It also founded an Engineering Guidance Conference for boys. The conference was two weeks long and introduced twenty-one high school students to the concepts of engineering. This program continued until the outbreak of World War II in 1941. Though the college faced its own deficits during the Depression, it aided the larger community by offering a series of free classes to unemployed men, beginning in 1932. They also made athletic facilities available for free to unemployed members of the community. Enrollment began to rise again for the 1935–1936 academic year.

===Decade of Progress campaign===

As the college moved out of the Great Depression, the college&#x27;s new president, William Mather Lewis, began what was called the Decade of Progress capital campaign, in order to fund delayed improvements. It started as a celebration of the 70th anniversary of Lafayette&#x27;s engineering program. President Lewis regarded this 70-year span as a period which &quot;covers the great development in American engineering which has now seemed to reach its peak.&quot; The goal of this campaign was to raise $500,000 for payments on Gates Hall, renovation of Van Wickle Memorial Library, and equipment upgrades in other departments. By the time the campaign closed in 1944, the college had received a total amount of $280,853.34.

===World War II===
Initially, most of the faculty and students at Lafayette wanted the U.S. to stay out of the conflict in Europe. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed the Pan-American Congress, saying that the US had a duty to protect Americans&#x27; science, culture, freedom and civilization, thirty-seven Lafayette faculty members wired the president objecting to his speech. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and declaration of war by the US, the Northampton County Council of Defense organized a College Council of Defense at Lafayette. The college took official action as well. It bolstered its ROTC program and improved facilities to prepare for air raid tests. The college continued its academic programs until the US lowered the draft age from 20 to 18 in November 1942.

While more students enlisted, Lafayette College was one of 36 academic institutions selected by the United States Department of War to train engineering and aviation cadets. After the war, the Serviceman&#x27;s Readjustment Act of 1944 (known as the GI Bill) resulted in a new wave of enrollment at Lafayette by veterans and by 1949 the college had approximately 2000 students.

===Coeducational institution===
In 1967, in consideration of cultural changes that included women seeking more participation in society, faculty requested that a special committee be formed to discuss making Lafayette a co-educational institution. That committee issued a formal recommendation the following year. In September 1970, Lafayette College welcomed its first official coeducational class with 146 women (123 freshmen, and 23 transfers).

===21st century===
In 2004, a report on religious life at Lafayette College was compiled, recommending a review of the college&#x27;s formal relationship with the Presbyterian church. The college has retained its affiliation, although it is not a member of the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities.

In 2007, the college commemorated the 250th birthday of General Lafayette through a series of lectures and campus dedications. Major festivities were held on September 6, 2007, Lafayette&#x27;s birthday. They were started the night before with a lecture by the historian David McCullough. On March 9, 2011, the Office of Alumni Affairs began a program called &quot;Wine 3/9&quot; to invite alumni from around the country and world to celebrate the original approval of the college charter by the Pennsylvania Legislature which occurred in 1826.

On January 16, 2013, Alison Byerly was announced as Lafayette&#x27;s 17th and first female president. She took office on July 1, 2013, replacing outgoing president Daniel Weiss. She was formerly a professor at Middlebury College. Under Byerly&#x27;s administration, the college began to undertake plans for expansion of the student body to 2,900 students and the construction of new dorms and academic buildings, with the stated goal of raising funds for financial aid. The campaign was the most successful fundraising campaign in college history and resulted in the renovation of multiple campus landmarks and one new building for the study of global education.

Nicole Hurd, the founder of the College Advising Corps, was announced as Byerly&#x27;s successor as president on May 15, 2021.

Lafayette was selected as the site of the 2024 vice presidential debate, though the Commission on Presidential Debates canceled the event after President Joe Biden&#x27;s campaign refused to participate in CPD-sponsored debates.

==Academics==

Lafayette College offers a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 37 fields. Lafayette also offers 14 Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees, 10 in areas of science and seven in fields of engineering. Its most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:

Lafayette College offers engineering programs within its liberal arts setting. The engineering programs offer six majors: chemical, civil and environmental, electrical &amp; computer, mechanical, engineering studies and integrative engineering. Integrative engineering combines disciplines and has focuses in robotics, environment and energy, and bioengineering. In 2012, 94% of Lafayette&#x27;s candidates (currently enrolled) passed the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination. This is the first requirement toward getting a professional engineering license. The national average varies from 70 to 87%, depending on the type of engineering.

Lafayette&#x27;s team was undefeated in the academic College Bowl in 1962, retiring after beating the University of California, Berkeley for its fifth victory. In recent years, Lafayette College students earned numerous national and international scholarships, For the class of 2012, Lafayette gave financial aid to 66% of its students, with the average package amounting to $26,850 for all students.

The college also offers merit-based academic scholarships: the Marquis Fellowship, a full-tuition scholarship, and the Marquis Scholarship, a half-tuition scholarship. As of 2021, Lafayette&#x27;s endowment was more than $1.063 billion.

== Admissions ==
Lafayette uses the Common Application as the sole method for students to the apply to the school. Applicants may opt for an earlier response from the college by applying through either early decision I or II; otherwise, applicants will apply via regular decision. Lafayette also participates with the Posse Foundation, which sends two groups of ten students each year from the New York and Washington metropolitan areas.

For the class of 2027, the college received 9,866 applications, of which 3,032 were accepted, for an acceptance rate of 30.7 percent.

==Campus==

Lafayette College occupies College Hill in Easton, Pennsylvania, located in the Lehigh Valley. It is about west of New York City and north of Philadelphia. Its 340-acre campus houses 69 buildings, comprising approximately 1.76 million square feet. This includes a 230-acre athletic campus. Lafayette&#x27;s campus buildings range in architectural style from Pardee Hall&#x27;s Second Empire design and Hogg Hall&#x27;s Collegiate Gothic, to the late modern architecture of the Williams Center for the Arts, the William E. and Carol G. Simon Wing of Skillman Library, and the Farinon College Center.

===Academic facilities===
Williams Center for the Arts is the college&#x27;s performing arts center. Completed in 1983, the building houses the Performance Series, the Williams Art Gallery and College Collections, the College Theater program, the departments of Art and Music, and the student-led Arts Society. The centerpiece of the Williams Center is the 400-seat theater/concert hall and also contains a versatile art gallery, a 100-seat black box theater, and classrooms and studios for music and art.

Pardee Hall, funded by Ario Pardee and completed in 1873, is one of the earliest buildings constructed at Lafayette College. When initially constructed, it was one of the largest academic buildings of its era. Pardee was designed to hold all of the science programs. Today it is used for a wide range of departments including languages and women and gender studies.

The Kirby Hall of Civil Rights was constructed in the late 1920s between the First World War and the Great Depression. The cost of the building was donated by Kirby. The design was &quot;rumored to be per square foot the most expensive building of its day.&quot; Lafayette selected the architectural firm Warren and Wetmore, known for their projects of designing the New York Yacht Club, the New York Biltmore Hotel, and Grand Central Station. The building&#x27;s exterior embraces styles of Republic Rome, the Renaissance, 17th English classicism, and Beaux-Arts. The interior lobby area contains broad staircases and is constructed of travertine marble. The building currently houses the Government and Law department. Students have access to the Kirby library, which has 20-foot ceilings and oak-paneled book cases. 

Markle Hall, now the main administrative building, holding Offices of Admissions and Financial Aid, was designed as the Hall of Mining Engineering. The college&#x27;s Special Collections maintains an online historical overview of all the campus buildings.

The David Bishop Skillman library, built in 1961, is the main library on campus; the Simon Wing was added in 1986, and a $22 million renovation and expansion was completed in 2004.
 The library contains over 500,000 volumes in its collections and subscribes to thousands of magazines, journals, and newspapers in the electronic and paper format. In addition, the college&#x27;s Special Collections and College Archives holds materials and displays holdings related to the Marquis de Lafayette. Reading and study areas and computer labs are available to the students.

==== East Asia Image Collection ====
The East Asia Image Collection (EAIC) is an open-access digital repository of images from all areas of the history of the Empire of Japan. It is curated by the Digital Scholarship Services of Lafayette College. Rare materials include prewar picture postcards, high-quality commercial prints, and colonial era picture books.

===Housing and student life facilities===

Lafayette College guarantees campus housing to all enrolled students. The school requires students to live in campus housing unless at home as a commuter or a senior approved for residing in private off-campus housing. The college offers on-campus housing options, including traditional halls, Greek chapter houses, suite-style halls, apartments, and group living units. Some halls are single gender, while others may be co-ed by floor, wing, room, or suite. In addition, Lafayette College provides specialty housings that ties to specific academic departments, student organizations, or religious affiliations. Other residences include the McKelvy House, the Arts Houses, the Hispanic Society of Lafayette, and the Hillel House.

Lafayette College offers a variety of dining options for campus residents. Farinon College Center houses two of the main dining halls on campus. The top floor of Farinon is an &quot;all-you-can-eat&quot; style buffet, while ground level is a grab and go. Marquis Hall, the largest dining hall on campus, is the second dining hall with an &quot;all-you-can-eat&quot; style buffet. Marquis also houses regularly themed events and contests. Simon&#x27;s, a sandwich shop, is located in the ground floor of Kamine, a residence hall. Gilbert&#x27;s, located on the ground floor of Kirby House, was opened in 1999 to provide a late-night hangout and food for students. Lower Farinon and Simon&#x27;s operate as the college&#x27;s late night options. The Skillman Café, located in the Skillman Library, sells Starbucks coffee and fresh-baked items made by the college. Lafayette also maintains an off-campus organic farm, LaFarm, which provides vegetables to the dining halls and employment for interested students.

==Athletics==

The Lafayette Leopards compete in the Patriot League under the guidance of current Athletic Director Sherryta Freeman. Lafayette offers students participation in 23 NCAA Division I sports, 18 club sports, and over 30 intramural sports. Student-athletes are considered students first, and athletes second. Lafayette currently ranks third nationally in student-athlete graduation success rate, according to the most recent NCAA study.

In 1896, Lafayette was the first non-Ivy League school to win a national football championship. It was the first to use the &quot;huddle&quot;, and the head harness, precursor to the football helmet.

===Chief rivalry (Lafayette-Lehigh)===
Lafayette College&#x27;s athletic program is notable for &quot;The Rivalry&quot; with nearby Lehigh University. Since 1884, the two football teams have met 150 times. This rivalry has had the most games in the history of American college football. It is also one of the oldest (when including high school or secondary school contests). It is also the longest-running rivalry in college football, with the teams playing at least once every year since 1897. The Rivalry is considered to be one of the best in college athletics by ESPNU. It recently ranked as #8 among the Top Ten College Football Rivalries.

==Student life==

Students at Lafayette are involved in over 200 clubs and organizations including athletics, fraternities and sororities, special interest groups, community service clubs and honor societies. The Lafayette College Student Government, consisting of 40 representatives, selected by 12 elected students, is responsible for chartering and supporting most of the student organizations on campus, and is responsible for allocating their budgets to allow these clubs to create programming and events for the campus community. Student Government collaborates with different administrative bodies on campus to improve the community, and is one component of the shared governance model with the faculty, administration, and Board of Trustees, which operates in order to best meet the needs of the students.

===Greek life===
Lafayette College has a significant Greek community. Though students are not eligible to join these organizations until sophomore year, and some Division I athletes are not eligible either, approximately 39% of eligible students join the school&#x27;s fraternities and sororities. All but two of the Greek organizations at Lafayette are located on campus, making it a viable living option. Additionally, members of each house commit themselves to various philanthropic ventures throughout the academic year as these groups work together with the college, local, and national affiliates to help achieve the goals and ideals their organizations were founded upon.

In addition to the social fraternities and sororities, there are also a number of academic honor societies on campus.

===Newspaper===
&quot;The Lafayette&quot;, Lafayette&#x27;s weekly student newspaper, was founded in 1870 and is the oldest college newspaper in Pennsylvania. It is available in both print and online form. Published every Friday during the academic year, print editions can be found around campus. All articles printed will also be available to read online and are uploaded every Friday. The newspaper has been published continuously since its creation, with the exception of during World War II, when operations were suspended between fall 1943 and March 1945, and during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 4,200 digitized issues of &quot;The Lafayette&quot; are available online. The newsroom is located in the Farinon College Center.

===Campus radio===
The college radio station, which was founded in 1946, is WJRH and broadcasts to the campus and greater Lehigh Valley area at 104.9FM.

=== Student government ===
Lafayette College Student Government is composed of six executive officers (president, vice president, treasurer, communications officer, inclusivity officer, and parliamentarian), and 21 general body members who are chosen through an application process and vetted by the elected members. With 27 total members, the student government covers a wide range of topics and serves as a liaison and representation for the student body with college administration.

===Alpha Phi Omega===
Alpha Phi Omega, an international co-educational service fraternity, was founded at Lafayette in 1925 by Frank Reed Horton in Hogg Hall. The chapter regained its charter in 2018 after the efforts of student leaders, and maintains a mission to provide service work on campus and in the Easton community.

=== Investment club ===
Founded in 1946, the club is the oldest student-run investment club in the country. The club made national news in 2016, when CNN profiled their investment skills that led to returns of over 175 times their initial investment over 70 years (from $3,000 in 1946 to $530,000 in 2016), thereby beating the S&amp;P 500 Index. As of April 2023, the portfolio has a market value of over $1 million and contains over 50 stocks.

===Engineers Without Borders===

The club was founded in 2003 and is a member of EWB-USA. Members of the club represent many disciplines in engineering and the liberal arts. Nationally, the club is linked with rural villages in the Yoro region of Honduras. EWB&#x27;s mission is to design and implement projects in these villages that help promote better life. The club has focused its efforts on water treatment systems.

El Convento, which is located in the Yoro district of central Honduras, will be the third sustainable water project EWB-LC students have worked on in the country since 2003 when the club was founded. The group has implemented gravity-fed water systems in neighboring Lagunitas and La Fortuna. In La Fortuna, the group utilized a slow sand filter in its system. The group&#x27;s previous work garnered national media exposure for being one of six national institutions to receive a $75,000 grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At Lafayette, the club mainly focuses on implementing service projects in the community, including a community food bank and volunteering with local high school robotics teams.

===Lafayette Activities Forum===
The Lafayette Activities Forum is a student-run organization to &quot;promote campus interaction and student relations by incorporating programs and entertainment that reflect the interests of the general student body&quot;. LAF is made up of five committees: Class Year Experience, Culture, Media, &amp; Entertainment, Traditions, Music &amp; Coffeehouse, and Marketing. They are in charge of planning events such the Spring Concert, Fall Fest, the Spot Underground, Open Mic nights, and Live Comedy.

<text>The INSEE code ( ) is a numerical indexing code used by the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) to identify various entities, including communes and &quot;départements&quot;. They are also used as national identification numbers given to people.

== Created under Vichy ==
Although today this national identification number is used by social security in France and is present on each person&#x27;s social security card (&quot;carte Vitale&quot;), it was originally created under Vichy France under the guise of the Registration Number to the National Directory of Identification of Physical People (&quot;Numéro d&#x27;inscription au répertoire des personnes physiques&quot;, NIRPP or simply NIR). The latter was originally to be used as a clandestine military recruitment tool, but in the end served to identify Jews, gypsies, and other &quot;undesirable&quot; populations under Vichy&#x27;s conceptions. The first digit of the NIR was 1 for a male European, 2 for a female European, 3 for a male Muslim, 4 for a female Muslim, 5 for a male Jew, 6 for a female Jew, 7 for a male foreigner, 8 for a female foreigner, while 9 and 0 were reserved for persons of undetermined racial status.

The Demographic Service was created in 1940 in order to replace the military recruitment office prohibited by the June 1940 Armistice with Nazi Germany. On October 11, 1941, the Demographic Service absorbed the former General Statistics of France (SGF, created in 1833). The new organization was called the National Statistical Service (&quot;Service national des statistiques&quot;, SNS).

== National identification numbers ==
Each French person receives at birth a national identification number, the &quot;numéro d&#x27;inscription au répertoire&quot; (NIR or National Repertory registration), also called a &quot;numéro de sécurité sociale&quot; (or Social Security number). This INSEE number is composed of 13 digits + a two-digit key. Although the total number is of 15 digits, its composition makes it easy for individuals to remember at least the first seven digits (they just have to know their sex, year and month of birth, and department of birth).

Their format is as follows: &quot;syymmlloookkk cc&quot;, where
* &quot;s&quot; is 1 for a male, 2 for a female,
* &quot;yy&quot; are the last two digits of the year of birth,
* &quot;mm&quot; is the month of birth, usually 01 to 12 (but there are special values for persons whose exact date of birth is not known),
* &quot;ll&quot; is the number of the department of origin : 2 digits, or 1 digit and 1 letter in metropolitan France, 3 digits for overseas.
* &quot;ooo&quot; is the commune of origin (a department is composed of various communes) : 3 digits in metropolitan France or 2 digits for overseas.
* &quot;kkk&quot; is an order number to distinguish people being born at the same place in the same year and month. This number is the one given by the &quot;Acte de naissance&quot;, an official paper which officialize a birth (and is needed throughout life for various administrative procedures, such as getting an identity card).
* &#x27;cc&#x27; is the &quot;control key&quot;, 01 to 97, equal to 97-(the rest of the number modulo 97).There are exceptions for people in particular situations.
The &quot;sex&quot; codes (&quot;s&quot;: 1 for male, 2 for female) can be given in special occasions for temporary registrations, such as for someone who a person who works as a wage-earner but is not registered for miscellaneous reasons. The sex code can be changed if someone underwent gender reassignment. Under Vichy France, but only in Algeria (not in metropolitan France) this &quot;s&quot; code was also used to register Jews, Algerian Muslims, foreigners, or ill-defined people. Thus, 3 or 4 was given to Muslim people of Algeria and of all colonies; 5 or 6 for indigenous Jews; 7 or 8 for foreigners; 9 or 0 for miscellaneous and ill-defined status (people in none of these classes).

The part &quot;llooo&quot; is used together, referred to as the COG, which identifies the person&#x27;s location of birth.

They are also specific codes for people whose date or place of birth is unknown, although this is today more and more rare (for example, the birth code is greater than 20 if the month of birth is unknown, and the communal code is 990 if the commune of origin is unknown). For overseas departments, the department number has three digits, and the communal number two digits (since 1950). People born abroad have a departmental code of 99, and the communal code is replaced by the code of the country of birth, which has three digits. Before 1964, departmental codes from 91 to 96 were used for Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco.

If in a specified month the total number of births exceeds 999, an extension common code is created.

The last code is obtained by a mathematical method (dividing by 97 the number formed by the first 13 digits, taking the remainder from this division, and then the &quot;complement to 97&quot;, that is the difference between 97 and this remainder): this gives the control key code.

== History ==
The NIR (National Identification Repertory) was created by René Carmille, who died at the Dachau concentration camp in 1944. Between April and August 1941, under the Vichy regime, Carmille conducted the first general survey to prepare the secret mobilisation of a French army. The codification was then done by General Marie in Algeria, to obtain a census of Jews, Muslims and other categories. The aim was to create a file of the whole of the French population and to discriminate according to ethnic or statutory criteria, following the racial policies of Vichy. Thus, the first digit that is now used to distinguish males and females then had other purposes: 3 or 4 for Algerian non-Jewish indigenous people, 5 or 6 for indigenous Jews, 7 or 8 for foreigners, and 9 or 0 for miscellaneous and ill-defined statutes.

This discriminatory categorization used in Algeria was abolished in 1944 and has never been used in Metropolitan France where, throughout the war, only &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; (for male and female) was used. The administration of the NIR was assigned in 1946 to the new Statistical Institute, the INSEE. This institution is also in charge of the RNIPP (&quot;répertoire national d&#x27;identification des personnes physiques&quot;, National Repertory of Identification of Physical Persons), which contains for each individual: the NIR, last name, first name, sex, date and place of birth, and a reference of the Birth Registration (&quot;Acte de naissance&quot;).

INSEE also gives numerical indexing codes (French: &quot;les Codes INSEE&quot;) to various administrative entities in France:
* INSEE codes (known as COG, for ) are given to various administrative units, notably the French communes (they do not coincide with postcodes, as there are 36,778 communes in France and many have the same name). The code has five digits:
** 2 digits (&quot;département&quot;) and 3 digits (commune) for the 96 &quot;départements&quot; of Metropolitan France.
** 3 digits (&quot;département&quot; or collectivity) and 2 digits (commune) for the overseas departments and overseas collectivities.

The departmental codes are well known since they were used as the last two digits of vehicle registration plates (75 is Paris, 13 Marseille, 31 Toulouse, etc.). However, this vehicle registration plate numbering system became optional in 2009 so the last two digits no longer necessarily indicate the department to which the car is registered.

The commune codes were assigned initially by numbering the alphabetically ordered list of commune names within each department or overseas division. Exceptions have occurred over time because some communes were renamed, some communes were split and new communes have been added to the end of the list.

The departmental codes are also best known as part of the French postal codes; but the postal codes do not include the INSEE commune numbers but were designed by geographical series starting by the main city of the department and then split geographically around them, with additional series given for special distribution. Some areas of the largest and most populated communes can also be assigned distinct series. The postal codes do not indicate precisely the communes but the location of the post office in charge for the distribution, and many rural communes share the same postal code number as the commune where the post office is located.

There are also 5-digit INSEE codes for foreign countries and territories, beginning with 99.

<doc id="573778" wikidata="Q222223" url="?curid=573778" title="Miami Air International">
<text>Miami Air International was an American charter airline based in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. It operated worldwide passenger charter flights for diverse groups including cruise operators, professional sports teams and the United States military. It was based at Miami International Airport. Miami Air&#x27;s customers included incentive groups, sports teams, Fortune 500 companies, major cruise lines, entertainers, political candidates and the United States government. Under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program, Miami Air was contracted by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command (USAF AMC) for transporting troops and cargo.

==History==
The airline was established in August 1990 and started operations in October 1991 using Boeing 727-200 aircraft on lease from Xerox Credit Corporation.

George Lyall who had a long career at Eastern Air Lines and Pan Am World Airways was chairman and Ross Fischer who had run System Operations at People Express and Eastern was president. These executives were the primary shareholders and founders, which also included a variety of former Eastern personnel, a former &quot;Big 8&quot; partner with extensive industry audit experience, an upcoming Miami lawyer and several former People Express operations personnel. By 2000, the company had grown to 8 owned Boeing 727 aircraft and revenues in excess of $100 million.

That year, a consortium led by Eagle Global Logistics purchased a majority stake in the company, primarily from retiring shareholders and embarked on converting the company&#x27;s Boeing 727s to cargo aircraft to operate its cargo hub in Austin, Texas, under the Quest International name. Simultaneously, new Boeing 737-800s were leased to provide the passenger service of the converted Boeing 727s. In 2001, the events of September 11th and the awarding of the postal contract to FedEx Express caused lease rates and values of Boeing 727s to plummet and in early 2002 EGL stopped utilizing Quest cargo aircraft and they were sold off.

Meanwhile, in large part due to the huge jump in the military business, Miami Air&#x27;s passenger business thrived and the company grew to 8 Boeing 737-800s and 2 passenger Boeing 727s by 2005. At that time one of the existing shareholders (TSI Holding Company) expressed a desire to purchase the entire company and bought out the other EGL consortium and remaining original shareholders.

For some time, Miami Air International with its Boeing 737-800s remained an ad hoc charterer with a wide customer base. The military, sports teams, cruise lines, tour operators and incentive groups were the main customers. Its operations were worldwide covering every continent except Antarctica. The Miami Dolphins and Pittsburgh Steelers secured charter services for the 2017 season.

Miami Air International was wholly owned by TSI Holdings and had 405 employees (at March 2007). The airline&#x27;s IATA code was changed from GL to LL due to Air Greenland&#x27;s use of the same code; Air Greenland was the first one to use the code.

On March 24, 2020, Miami Air International filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection and ceased operations on May 8, 2020. All leased aircraft from TUI fly Belgium were returned to Brussels.

Tomas Romero, the owner of World Atlantic Airlines, acquired Miami Air International including all of its certificates and trademarks in late May for US$3.3 million, during a bankruptcy auction.

A &quot;new&quot; Miami Air would operate with the same aircraft type and employ the same key personnel as the bankrupt firm, as well as some new experienced employees.

==Fleet==
===Final fleet===

At the time of closure, the Miami Air International fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

===Retired fleet===

Miami Air International had used the following aircraft models in the past:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On May 3, 2019, Miami Air International Flight 293, a charter flight that originated from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, slid into the St. Johns River with 143 occupants on board after landing at Naval Air Station Jacksonville in Jacksonville, Florida, in the middle of a storm. All on board survived, and there were 21 injuries reported.

<doc id="573784" wikidata="Q529012" url="?curid=573784" title="Cabinet of Japan">
<text>The is the chief executive body of the government of Japan. It consists of the prime minister, who is appointed by the Emperor after being nominated by the National Diet, in addition to up to nineteen other members, called ministers of state. The current cabinet is Second Ishiba Cabinet, which was formed on 11 November 2024, is led by the prime minister Shigeru Ishiba. The country has had a Liberal Democratic–Komeito coalition cabinet (minority government) since 2024.

The prime minister is nominated by the National Diet, while the remaining ministers are appointed and dismissed by the prime minister. The Cabinet is collectively responsible to the National Diet and must resign if a motion of no confidence is adopted by the National Diet.

==Appointment==
Under the Constitution of Japan, Cabinet ministers are appointed after the selection of the prime minister. A majority of the Cabinet, including the prime minister, must be members of the National Diet, and all members must be civilians. Under the Cabinet Law, the number of Cabinet ministers (excluding the prime minister) must be fourteen or less, but this may be increased to nineteen if a special need arises. If the Cabinet collectively resigns, it continues to exercise its functions until the appointment of a new prime minister. While they are in office, legal action may not be taken against Cabinet ministers without the consent of the prime minister. The Cabinet must resign &quot;en masse&quot; in the following circumstances:
*When a motion of no confidence is adopted, or a vote of confidence defeated, by the House of Representatives, unless there is a dissolution of the house within ten days.
*Upon the first convocation of the National Diet after a general election to the House of Representatives (even if the same prime minister is to be re-elected and appointed, and every other minister is to be reappointed).
*When the position of prime minister becomes vacant, or the prime minister declares his intention to resign.

==Powers==
The Cabinet exercises two kinds of power. Some of its powers are nominally exercised by the Emperor with the binding &quot;advice and approval&quot; of the Cabinet. Other powers are explicitly vested in the Cabinet. Contrary to the practice in many constitutional monarchies, the Emperor is not even the &quot;nominal&quot; chief executive. Instead, the Constitution explicitly vests executive authority in the Cabinet. Hence, nearly all of the day-to-day work of governing is done by the Cabinet.

In practice, much of the Cabinet&#x27;s authority is exercised by the prime minister. Under the Constitution, the prime minister exercises &quot;control and supervision&quot; over the executive branch, and no law or Cabinet order can take effect without the prime minister&#x27;s countersignature (and the emperor&#x27;s promulgation). While Cabinet Ministers in most other parliamentary democracies theoretically have some freedom of action (within the limits of cabinet collective responsibility), the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the prime minister&#x27;s authority.

According to Article 75 of the Constitution, Ministers of State are not subject to legal action without the consent of the prime minister during their tenure of office.

===Powers exercised via the Emperor===
* Promulgation of amendment of the constitution, laws, cabinet orders, and treaties
* Convocation of the National Diet
* Dissolution of the House of Representatives
* Proclamation of general elections to the National Diet
* Receiving of foreign ambassadors and ministers
* Conferring of honours

===Explicit powers===
* Execution of the law
* Conduct of foreign affairs
* Conclusion of treaties (with the consent of the National Diet).
* Administration of the civil service
* Drafting of the budget (which must be adopted by the National Diet)
* Adoption of cabinet orders
* Granting of general amnesty, special amnesty, commutation of punishment, reprieve, and restoration of rights
* Signing of laws or cabinet orders by the relevant Minister of State and countersigned by the Prime Minister
* Appointment of the associate justices of the Supreme Court of Japan (except for the Chief Justice, who is nominated by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the Emperor)
* Appointment of vice-ministers (who are nominated by their respective minister to whom they will report)

==List of cabinets of Japan==

<text>Weitek Corporation was an American chip-design company that originally focused on floating-point units for a number of commercial CPU designs. During the early to mid-1980s, Weitek designs could be found powering a number of high-end designs and parallel-processing supercomputers.

Weitek started in 1981, when several Intel engineers left to form their own company. Weitek developed math coprocessors for several systems, including those based on the Motorola 68000 family, the WTL 1064 and 1164, and for Intel-based i286 systems, the WTL 1067. The 1067 was physically implemented as three chips, the WTL 1163, 1164 and 1165. When Intel&#x27;s own FPU design for the i386 fell far behind in development, Weitek delivered the 1167 for them in the form of a daughtercard. Improvements in chip manufacturing allowed this to be reduced to a single-chip version, the WTL 2167. The WTL 3167 of 1988, also known as the Abacus, extended the system for use in Intel 80386 systems, and finally the WTL 4167 in 1989 for the Intel 80486 which used the 486&#x27;s larger socket format and ran at higher clock rates than the 3167 to provide higher performance arrount 4 MFLOPS in single precision.

Weitek would later outfit FPUs to the early SPARC architecture such as the 3170 and 3172. Weitek FPUs had several differences compared to x87 offerings, lacking extended double precision but having a register-file rather than a stack-based model, or using memory-mapped I/O as opposed to port-mapped I/O.

As orders increased for supercomputer applications, Weitek found themselves seriously disadvantaged by their fab, which was becoming rather outdated. HP approached them with a deal to use their newer fabs. This proved advantageous for both, and soon HP&#x27;s fabs were open to anyone. Weitek also worked with HP on the design of their latest PA-RISC design and sold their version known as the XL-RISC 8200, which was sold as an embedded design and had some use in laser printers. In these roles, the company referred to the systems as &quot;HyperScript Processor&quot;s, referring to the PostScript rendering engine.

In the late 1980s Weitek saw a new opportunity and started developing frame buffers for Sun Microsystems workstations. In the early 1990s they also introduced the SPARC POWER μP (as in &quot;power-up&quot;), a pin-compatible version of the SPARC processor. The μP could be dropped into existing SPARCstation 2 and SPARCstation IPX workstations and ran at 80 MHz, double the clock speed of the CPUs it replaced. The chip ran twice as fast internally, providing a boost of about 50–60% in overall speed, due to the bus not getting any faster. However, they did not pursue this concept with later generations of SPARC processors.

Weitek turned their frame-buffer experience to the PC market in the early 90s and introduced a series of SVGA multimedia chipsets known as the &quot;POWER&quot; systems. Consisting of two chips, one drawing the graphics known as the P9000 and another handling the output, the VideoPower 5x86, the POWER series was used in a number of third-party designs based on the VESA Local Bus standard. The P9001 moved to PCI and became fairly popular in 1994, known as the Viper in designs from Diamond and Orchid. The final generation, the P9100, combined the P9001 and 5286 into a single chip. Weitek adapters were fairly successful in the early days of the 486 market, but fell from use when less expensive systems were introduced by a host of new players in the mid-1990s. A couple of versions were also released for the Amiga and used its ReTargetable Graphics standard.

During the early 1990s, most CPU designs started including FPUs built into the system, basically &quot;for free&quot;, and Weitek made a series of attempts to re-enter the low-end CPU and graphics driver market with their W464 (486) and W564 (P5) systems, which used the host machine&#x27;s RAM as the frame buffer to lower costs. By 1995, the company was almost dead, and in late 1996, Rockwell&#x27;s Semiconductor Systems purchased the remains and quickly disappeared.

<doc id="573803" wikidata="Q1059869" url="?curid=573803" title="Chalk's International Airlines">
<text>Chalk&#x27;s International Airlines, formerly Chalk&#x27;s Ocean Airways, was an airline with its headquarters on the grounds of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in unincorporated Broward County, Florida near Fort Lauderdale. It operated scheduled seaplane services to the Bahamas. Its main base was Miami Seaplane Base (MPB) until 2001, with a hub at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. On September 30, 2007, the United States Department of Transportation revoked the flying charter for the airline, and later that year, the airline ceased operations.

==History==
The airline was founded by Arthur Burns &quot;Pappy&quot; Chalk, and started &quot;ad-hoc&quot; charter operations as the Red Arrow Flying Service in 1917 flying a floatplane. After &quot;Pappy&quot; Chalk served in the Army Air Service in World War I, he returned to Miami and commenced scheduled service between Miami and Bimini in the Bahamas in February 1919 as Chalk&#x27;s Flying Service. Chalk&#x27;s first base was a beach umbrella on the Miami shore of Biscayne Bay. In 1926 a landfill island, Watson Island, was created in Biscayne Bay close to Miami. Chalk&#x27;s built an air terminal there, and operated from the island for the next 75 years.

During Prohibition, Chalk&#x27;s was a major source of alcohol smuggled from the Bahamas to the United States.

Pappy Chalk sold the airline to a friend in 1966, but continued to be involved in the daily operations of the airline until he retired in 1975. He died in 1977 at the age of 88.

In the early 1970s, Frakes Aviation bought the rights to the aircraft and began a conversion program, replacing the old Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340 Wasp radial engines with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6 turboprops. By 1985 three of Chalk&#x27;s eight Grumman Mallards had been converted, with five ex-military piston engined Grumman Albatross aircraft making up the balance of the fleet.

In 1974, Resorts International purchased Chalk&#x27;s Airlines, which became the primary air carrier to Paradise Island near the Bahamian capital of Nassau, where Resorts International owned and operated hotels and other resort facilities. After Resorts International constructed a short take off and landing (STOL) runway on Paradise Island and switched to using STOL-capable de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprop aircraft operated by subsidiary Paradise Island Airlines, it sold Chalk&#x27;s in 1991 to United Capital Corporation, an Illinois-based investment firm (which was not affiliated with United Airlines).

The television show &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, a symbol of both Miami and the 1980s, featured a Chalk&#x27;s seaplane in its opening credits. N2969, which had a fatal accident in 2005, as Flight 101 is featured in an extended scene at the end of the third-season episode &quot;Baseballs of Death&quot;, when the antagonist attempts to leave the US. The music video for George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; and Miami Vice second-season episode &quot;One Way Ticket&quot; featured a Chalk&#x27;s seaplane, N2974. In one of the final scenes of the motion picture &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, Dr Frederick Chilton is seen disembarking a Chalk&#x27;s aircraft in Bimini, where Hannibal Lecter is waiting to &quot;have him for dinner&quot;. A Chalks plane also makes an appearance at the end of the movie &#x27;After The Sunset&#x27; with Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek&#x27;s characters embracing as they stand next to it. Chalk&#x27;s fleet was as high-maintenance as it was glamorous. It was a unique carrier, its Watson Island base being the smallest port of entry in the United States. Chalk&#x27;s revenues were about $7.5 million in 1986, when it carried 130,000 passengers. Most were staying at Resorts International properties, although island residents used the airline for shopping trips to Miami.

United Capital expanded Chalk&#x27;s service to Key West, Florida, and Nassau and acquired additional aircraft, but struggled financially. In 1996, United Capital sold Chalk&#x27;s to a group of investors, who operated the airline under the name Pan Am Air Bridge. In January 1998, Texas-based aircraft lease company Air Alaska purchased 70% of Pan Am Air Bridge, but following the collapse of Air Alaska, Pan Am Air Bridge filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection only a year later on January 11, 1999. James Confalone, a businessman and former Eastern Airlines pilot, purchased Chalk&#x27;s out of bankruptcy for $925,000 on August 2, 1999; it had been reduced to two aircraft and only 35 staff. Confalone bought five additional Grumman Mallard seaplanes and arranged a contract to buy 14 larger Grumman G-111 seaplanes to expand the operation. On December 17, 1999, the airline was relaunched as Chalk&#x27;s Ocean Airways.

In late 2001 following the September 11 attacks, Chalk&#x27;s was forced to leave its longtime operations base on Watson Island due to security concerns over its proximity to the Port of Miami. Helicopter traffic had also increased around Watson Island. Operations moved to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, where Chalk&#x27;s already had its maintenance base.

The airline suspended operations after the crash of Chalk&#x27;s Ocean Airways Flight 101 on December 19, 2005. It had planned to resume flights between Fort Lauderdale and the Bahamas under its earlier name of Chalk&#x27;s International Airlines on November 9, 2006, but its airworthiness certificate issued by the Bahamas had expired. It resorted to using aircraft &quot;wet leased&quot; from and operated by Big Sky Airlines to operate flights from Fort Lauderdale to Key West and to St. Petersburg, Florida. Chalk&#x27;s added flights between Palm Beach International Airport (PBIA) and destinations in the Bahamas in late May 2007, but carried only 14 passengers through PBIA that August.

Chalk&#x27;s ceased flying from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport after September 3, 2007. After the final report from the Flight 101 crash investigation was released, the United States Department of Transportation revoked the airline&#x27;s flying authority for scheduled service on September 30, 2007, effectively shutting down the airline. Chalk&#x27;s continued to hold its FAR 121 operating with a part 298 authority in good standing, and sought to add 60-passenger regional jets to its FAR 121 operating licence, but these efforts never came to fruition.

Chalk&#x27;s had claimed to be the oldest continuously operating airline in the world, having begun operations in 1917 and scheduled flights in February 1919, and having only ceased operations for three years due to World War II, two days due to 1992&#x27;s Hurricane Andrew, and eleven months due to an &quot;at altitude tragedy&quot; on December 19, 2005. The title of oldest operating airline is now given to KLM of the Netherlands, founded later in 1919.

==Fleet==

During 2006 the airline leased conventional Beechcraft 1900D turboprop commuter land planes from Big Sky Airlines which were later replaced by Saab 340A and other wet leased aircraft while working with the Federal Aviation Administration to rebuild its fleet of Grumman G-73T Turbine Mallards.

As of March 2007 the Chalk&#x27;s International Airlines fleet comprised:
* 4 Mallards (5 originally delivered but one crashed)
* 2 Saab 340A The Saabs were chartered by Chalks from Bimini Island Air.

==Incidents and accidents==
* In 1994, Captain John Alberto and co-pilot Alan Turner drowned after their aircraft sank due to the failure of the airplane&#x27;s bilge pump while they were taxiing at Key West. Captain Alberto left behind a wife and two children. Jimmy Buffett dedicated a chapter to Captain Alberto in his book &quot;A Pirate Looks At Fifty&quot;.
* On December 19, 2005, Chalk&#x27;s Ocean Airways Flight 101 from Fort Lauderdale to Bimini made an unscheduled stop at Watson Island, Miami. Within a minute of taking-off again, it fell into the sea near Miami Beach. Witnesses said they saw smoke billowing from the plane and the separation of its right wing as it plunged into the ocean. None of the twenty people on boardeighteen passengers and two pilotssurvived. At first, only nineteen of the twenty bodies were found (by the Coast Guard and Miami Beach Ocean Rescue); on December 23, 2005, the twentieth was found by two Miami-Dade firefighters while fishing on their day off. Investigators later identified cracks in the main support beam connecting the wing to the fuselage. The plane was a Grumman G-73T TurboMallard, registration N2969, manufactured in 1947. It was the second fatal accident for Chalk&#x27;s Ocean Airways. A few months after the NTSB released its report on the crash, the airline shut down.

<text>Operation Pedestal (, Battle of mid-August), known in Malta as  (), was a British operation to carry supplies to the island of Malta in August 1942, during the Second World War.

Malta was a base from which British ships, submarines and aircraft attacked Axis convoys to Libya, during the North African Campaign (1940–1943). From 1940 to 1942, the Axis conducted the Siege of Malta, with air and naval forces. Despite many losses, enough supplies were delivered by the British for the population and military forces on Malta to resist, although it ceased to be an offensive base for much of 1942. The most crucial supply item in Operation Pedestal was fuel, carried by , an American-owned tanker with a British crew. The convoy sailed from Britain on 3 August 1942 and passed through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean on the night of 

The Axis attempt to prevent the fifty ships of the convoy reaching Malta, using bombers, German E-boats, Italian MAS and MS boats, minefields and submarine ambushes, was the last sizeable Axis success in the Mediterranean. More than and Royal Navy sailors and airmen were killed and only five of the fourteen merchant ships reached Grand Harbour. While costly for the Allies, it was a strategic victory; the arrival of &quot;Ohio&quot; justified the decision to hazard so many warships; its cargo of aviation fuel revitalised the Maltese air offensive against Axis shipping. Submarines returned to Malta and Spitfires flown from the aircraft carrier enabled a maximum effort to be made against Axis ships. Italian convoys had to detour further away from the island, lengthening the journey and increasing the time during which air and naval attacks could be mounted.

The Siege of Malta was broken by the Allied reconquest of Egypt and Libya after the Second Battle of El Alamein (23 October – 11 November) and by Operation Torch (8–16 November) in the western Mediterranean, which enabled land-based aircraft to escort merchant ships to the island.
==Background==

===Allied operations===

The Allies waged the Western Desert Campaign (1940–43) in North Africa, against the Axis forces of Italy aided by Germany, which sent the and substantial &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; detachments to the Mediterranean in late 1940. Up to the end of the year, with of cargo had reached Malta without loss and a reserve of seven months&#x27; supplies had been accumulated. Three convoys to Malta in 1941 suffered the loss of only one merchant ship. From January 1941 to August 1942, ships had delivered but had been sunk and modern, efficient, merchant ships, naval and air forces had been diverted from other routes for long periods; 31 supply runs by submarines had been conducted. Reinforcements for Malta included aircraft carrier ferry operations (Club Runs) to deliver fighters.

From August 1940 to the end of August 1942, and Sptifire fighters had been flown off carriers in the western Mediterranean. Many other aircraft used Malta as a staging post for North Africa and the Desert Air Force. Malta was a base for air, sea and submarine operations against Axis supply convoys and from 1 June to 31 October 1941, British forces sank about of Axis shipping on the African convoy routes, by the navy and by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Fleet Air Arm (FAA). Loaded ships sailing to Africa accounted for 90 per cent of the ships sunk and Malta-based squadrons were responsible for about 75 per cent of the ships that were sunk by aircraft. Military operations from Malta and use of the island as a staging post, led to Axis air campaigns against the island in 1941 and 1942. By late July, the on the island averaged wastage of and the remaining aviation fuel was only sufficient for the fighters, making it impractical to send more bombers and torpedo-bombers for offensive operations.

===Malta, 1942===

Operation Julius, a plan to supply Malta by simultaneous convoys from Gibraltar in Operation Harpoon and from Alexandria by Operation Vigorous was a costly failure. Only two merchant ships from Harpoon reached the island; the Vigorous convoy was forced to turn back and several convoy escorts and many merchantmen, including the only tanker in Harpoon, were sunk. By August, the fortnightly (two-weekly) ration on Malta for one person was sugar, fats, bread and of corned beef. An adult male worker had a daily intake of and women and children received In August a mass slaughter of livestock began on the island to reduce the need for fodder imports and to convert grazing land for crop growing; the meat being supplied to the public through Victory Kitchens. Malta would be forced to surrender if fuel, food and ammunition were not delivered before September and Air Vice-Marshal Keith Park, the local air commander since July, warned that there remained only a few weeks&#x27; supply of aviation fuel. The British Admiralty had the fast minelayer converted to carry fuel and submarines were pressed into service to run supplies of aviation fuel, anti-aircraft ammunition and torpedoes through the blockade, to keep the remaining aircraft operational. The First Lord of the Admiralty Albert Alexander and Admiral of the Fleet Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord (professional head of the Royal Navy), concurred with the Prime Minister Winston Churchill that the loss of Malta would be

... and prepared a new convoy operation from Gibraltar, with an unprecedented number of escorts using ships taken from the Far East and from the Home Fleet, which had vessels to spare since the suspension of Arctic convoys, following the Convoy PQ 17 disaster.

===Axis command===
The Axis command structure in the Mediterranean was centralised at the top and fragmented at the lower levels. Benito Mussolini had monopolised authority over the Italian armed forces since 1933 by taking the offices of Minister of War, Minister of the Navy and Minister of Aeronautics. &quot;Feldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; commanded German ground forces in the theatre as Commander-in-Chief South () but had no authority over Axis operations in North Africa or the organisation of convoys to Libya. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II and &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; X were subordinate to the usual &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; chain of command. Since November 1941, Kesselring had exercised some influence over the conduct of German naval operations in the Mediterranean as the nominal head of Naval Command Italy () but this was subordinate to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; chain of command. German inter-service rivalries obstructed co-operation and there was little unity of effort between German and the Italian forces in the Mediterranean. Kesselring had authority only to co-ordinate plans for combined operations by German and Italian forces and some influence on the use of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (Italian Air Force) for the protection of convoys to North Africa. The Italian Navy resisted all German attempts to integrate its operations; ships in different squadrons never trained together and &quot;Supermarina&quot; (Italian Naval High Command) constantly over-ruled subordinate commanders.

==Prelude==

===Allied plans===

====Operation Pedestal====

Admiralty planning for Operation Pedestal began in late July 1942, under the direction of Vice-Admiral Neville Syfret, Rear Admirals Lumley Lyster and Harold Burrough and the Naval Staff. Syfret transferred to on 27 July when &quot;Nelson&quot; and returned to Scapa Flow from Freetown, West Africa. Syfret convened a conference on 29 July, for Flag and Commanding Officers of the naval forces for Pedestal at Scapa, to consider the orders for the operation. Several smaller operations were also planned, to be carried out concurrently with Pedestal. The convoy comprised 14 merchant vessels, the most important being &quot;Ohio&quot;, the only large, fast tanker available, a US ship loaned to the British, with a British crew. As insurance against the loss of &quot;Ohio&quot; and its of oil, the other ships were to carry fuel in drums. The convoy was to be protected by two battleships, three aircraft carriers, seven cruisers, thirty-two destroyers and seven submarines, the largest escort force yet.

The combined group was named &quot;Force F&quot;; the convoy and escorts from Britain as far as the rendezvous, became &quot;Force P&quot;; the aircraft carriers &quot;Victorious&quot;, &quot;Argus&quot; and escorts were named &quot;Force M&quot; on the voyage to the meeting point. The aircraft carrier &quot;Eagle&quot; and its escort from Gibraltar to the rendezvous became &quot;Force J&quot; and the carrier &quot;Indomitable&quot; and its escorts from Freetown were called &quot;Force K&quot;. During Operation Berserk, all the carriers and escorts became &quot;Force G&quot;; &quot;Force R&quot; was made up of the fleet refuelling vessels and , escorted by four corvettes and an ocean-going tug, a Dale-class oiler; escorts were named &quot;Force W&quot; also for Operation Berserk, &quot;Force X&quot; formed the close escort to Malta, &quot;Force Z&quot; was made up of the heavy ships of &quot;Force F&quot;, that were to turn back to Gibraltar and &quot;Force Y&quot; was to conduct Operation Ascendant, a run from Malta to Gibraltar by the two ships that had reached the island during Operation Harpoon and escorts, when Pedestal entered the Mediterranean.

Embarked on &quot;Victorious&quot; were 809 Squadron and 884 Squadron FAA with sixteen Fulmars and 885 Squadron with six Sea Hurricanes; on &quot;Indomitable&quot;, 806 Squadron had ten Martlets, 800 Squadron and 880 Squadron had twenty-four Sea Hurricanes, 827 Squadron and 831 Squadron had fourteen Fairey Albacores. On &quot;Eagle&quot; were 801 Squadron and 813 Squadron with sixteen Sea Hurricanes. Based on Malta were five Baltimores, six PRU Spitfires and five Wellington Mk VIII reconnaissance aircraft. Reinforcements were sent temporarily from Egypt, raising the maximum number of operational aircraft to a hundred Spitfires, thirty-six Beaufighters, thirty Beauforts, three Wellingtons, two Liberators, two Baltimores and three FAA Albacores and Swordfish. The convoy was named WS.21S (&quot;Winston&#x27;s Specials&quot; were troop convoys from Britain to Suez via the Cape of Good Hope). After the usual convoy conference just before sailing, Burrough met with the Convoy Commodore, A. G. Venables and the masters of the merchant ships on board his flagship, to brief them. A similar meeting was held with radio operators of the merchantmen to explain fleet communications and procedures. Envelopes marked &quot;Not to be opened until 08:00 hours August 10&quot; were handed to the ships&#x27; masters, containing personal messages signed by the First Lord of the Admiralty wishing the masters &quot;God Speed&quot;. The convoy sailed from the River Clyde on the night of escorted by &quot;Nigeria&quot;, and destroyers, to rendezvous with the other escorts the following morning.

====Operation Bellows====

Shortly before the departure from Scapa, the Admiralty decided that &quot;Furious&quot; should carry out Operation Bellows, to reinforce Malta (known informally as a Club Run) with Spitfires at the same time as Operation Pedestal. The departure of &quot;Furious&quot; was delayed by technical difficulties caused by the flight deck, which sloped upwards to a point amidships. A Spitfire made a practice take-off, with wooden wedges in the flaps to ensure a and &quot;Furious&quot; steaming at , into a wind. The Spitfire was thrown into the air by the rise on the flight deck, bounced onto the forward slope, fell off the front near stalling speed and narrowly avoided ditching. An immediate request was made to the Air Ministry for constant-speed propellers and two days later, a Spitfire with the new propeller took off easily, leaving 38 aircraft still on board to be flown to Malta. In company with , she joined &quot;Nelson&quot; and the convoy three days before the start of Operation Pedestal.

====Operations Berserk and Ascendant====

On 31 July, &quot;Nelson&quot;, &quot;Rodney&quot;, , , and destroyers sailed from Scapa to rendezvous with and from Gibraltar and and , from Freetown, for Operation Berserk. The operation took place between the Azores and Gibraltar from and included exercises with the merchant ships in anti-aircraft gunnery, emergency turns and in changing cruising formations, communicating with signal flags and short range wireless telegraphy (W/T). The risk to security in breaking W/T silence during the exercises, was accepted by Allied planners and according to Cunningham, the convoy attained efficiency in manoeuvring &quot;comparable to that of a fleet unit.&quot; The aircraft of the force performed dummy air attacks in the afternoon of 8 August, to exercise radar reporting, the fighter direction organisation and to give anti-aircraft gun crews aircraft recognition practice, followed by a fly past. In Operation Ascendant, &quot;Troilus&quot; and &quot;Orari&quot;, the two merchant ships that had survived the Harpoon fiasco in June, were to sail from Malta for Gibraltar, with the destroyers and (&quot;Force Y&quot;) on the night of the first day of Operation Pedestal. The ships were to be disguised with Italian deck markings and sortie from Malta, to to the south of Lampedusa, then sail past Kelibia on Cap Bon, keeping close to the Tunisian coast as far as the Galita Channel and from there make for Gibraltar. (&quot;Force Y&quot; left Malta about 20:30 on 10 August, reached Cap Bon the next day and briefly exchanged fire with the which was minelaying. The Italian ship showed French recognition lights and the British destroyers ended the engagement; &quot;Force Y&quot; arrived at Gibraltar at about 10:00 on 14 August.)

===Axis plans===
The Germans and Italians planned separately and although they co-operated to an extent, &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II in Sicily co-ordinated plans with the local &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; commanders but conducted its attacks separately. &quot;Supermarina&quot;, the Italian Navy headquarters, considered four contingencies, that the Allies would use their naval strength to protect a convoy, the main Allied battle fleet would sortie to provoke a fleet action, to use a powerful covering force for a convoy to force a passage to the north of Pantelleria, instead of turning west at the entrance to Skerki Bank or to use aircraft-carriers for attacks on Sardinian airfields, to ease the passage of a convoy. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had 328 aircraft (90 torpedo-bombers, 62 bombers, 25 dive-bombers and 151 fighters) and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; 456 aircraft (328 dive-bombers, 32 medium bombers and 96 fighters [most of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; torpedo-bombers had been sent to Norway in June and were too late for the operation]). About 20 Junkers Ju 88s from &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; X on Crete arrived at Sicily on 11 August, for operations the next morning and another eight arrived from Crete the same day, after completing convoy escort operations in the Aegean.

The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; had four battleships, three heavy and ten light cruisers, twenty-one destroyers, twenty-eight torpedo boats and sixty-four submarines but most of the capital ships were non-operational for lack of fuel and air cover. The navy had received only of fuel in June, equivalent to 20 per cent of fuel consumption by convoys and the Italian battleships had to refuel the smaller vessels. Because of the fuel-shortage, Mussolini suggested to Hitler that a Malta convoy should be opposed only by submarines and land-based aircraft. &quot;Supermarina&quot; managed to prepare the 3rd Cruiser Division with the eight-inch cruisers , and and seven destroyers, along with the 7th Cruiser Division with the six-inch cruisers , and and five destroyers plus 18 submarines, 19 torpedo boats (six MS and 13 MAS); the Germans had three U-boats and four S-boats. The Axis air forces lacked the fighters to escort surface ships, bombers and torpedo bombers and Mussolini preferred to use the fighters as bomber escorts and as cover for surface forces. Kesselring rejected the Italian request to provide air cover for the Italian fleet, because the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; did not have enough fighters.

Kesselring doubted that the Italian heavy cruisers could succeed even with air cover and thought that the Italians used the lack of fuel as a pretext. Admiral Eberhard Weichold, the German naval attaché in Rome, wanted the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to provide air cover for Italian ships. Marshal Ugo Cavallero, Chief of the General Staff , also wanted Italian surface forces to participate in the operation but &quot;Supermarina&quot; did not want its big ships to operate without air cover. Axis tactics were similar to those used against Operation Harpoon in June; a joint special air reconnaissance of the western Mediterranean to be flown by Axis aircraft on 11 and 12 August, Axis aircraft based in Sicily and Sardinia, Italian submarines and German U-boats and Axis torpedo boats and minefields being used as successive barriers. The four barriers were to cause the convoy to disperse and be vulnerable to a force of cruisers and destroyers. Twenty-two torpedo-bombers, about one hundred and twenty-five dive-bombers with fighter escorts and forty medium bombers were to be used in a synchronised attack. Priority was given to the destruction of aircraft carriers, to prevent them from intervening when Italian surface forces closed in on the remnants of the convoy. The Axis navies had nineteen submarines in the western Mediterranean; nine boats were to be stationed north of Algeria between longitudes and . Ten submarines were to wait between Fratelli Rocks and the northern entrance to the Skerki Bank, some arrayed north-west of Cap Bon, to co-operate with aircraft. An Italian submarine was to patrol west of Malta, one off Navarino in Greece and three more about west-south-west of Crete.
From June 1940 to April 1942, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; had laid about 2,320 sea mines between Cap Granitola at the south-west end of Sicily and Pantelleria, 1,020 mines between Pantelleria and Ras el Mustafa, Tunisia, 6,880 mines between the Aegadian Islands and Cap Bon and 1,040 mines between Bizerte and Keith Rock. The Italians also intended to lay a temporary minefield off Cap Bon on the night of 11/12 August, just before the convoy passed through. On the night of 12/13 August, thirteen MAS, six MS torpedo boats and four S-boats were to lie in wait south of Marettimo (an Aegadian Island) and off Cap Bon, then later to wait off Pantelleria. The 3rd Cruiser Division and the 7th Cruiser Division would be about north of Pantelleria during the afternoon of 12 August and then sail through the night on an interception course south of Pantelleria, to attack the remains of the convoy and its close escort just before dawn. It was assumed that Axis aircraft could provide fighter cover against the larger number of British aircraft from Malta. Should an Allied convoy sail from Egypt, it would be attacked by the 8th Cruiser Division based at Navarino in Greece but the division was ordered into the Ionian Sea on 12 August, to support the 3rd Cruiser Division.

===Axis preparations===

Axis planners lacked information about Allied plans but had fair knowledge of the Allied order of battle and the movement of Allied forces inside the Mediterranean, from the reports of ship-watching stations near Gibraltar, reconnaissance aircraft and submarines. Reports from the &quot;Abwehr&quot; on 5 August convinced Kesselring that the Allies were preparing a big operation to supply Malta from the west, in conjunction with a simultaneous attack on Mersa Matruh in Egypt. Allied bombers from Malta were expected to attack Italian naval forces as Malta fighters covered the passage of a convoy through the Sicilian Narrows. The Germans also considered a threat to Crete when the convoy had reached Malta and Kesselring ordered increased readiness of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; units in Sicily and Crete, aircraft being transferred from Crete to Sardinia and Sicily. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II reduced operations to increase serviceability, prepared facilities at Elmas in Sardinia for reinforcements sent from &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; X in the eastern Mediterranean. The Allies learned through Enigma that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had supply difficulties in Sardinia, preventing the movement there of long-range bombers and of fighter operations to the extent intended and that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had sent 40 to 45 long-range bombers and 6 twin-engined fighters from the eastern Mediterranean; &quot;Fliegerführer Afrika&quot; was forced to divert aircraft for convoy escorts in the Tobruk area. On the morning of 8 August, a report erroneously indicated that an Argus-class carrier and four destroyers had sailed into Gibraltar and &quot;Abwehr&quot; agents reported much shipping in the Strait of Gibraltar on the night of By &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft were on Sicily along with of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and another assembled on Sardinia.

The sighted the British ships at 04:30 on 11 August; the captain approached on the surface and fired three torpedoes, claiming a hit on the carrier in a 09:36 sighting report and during the evening a photographed the fleet from high altitude, immune to anti-aircraft fire or FAA fighters. The Italian submarines were ordered into three patrol lines to intercept the convoy. On 12 August, Kesselring began discussions with (Italian High Command) for the co-ordination of Axis forces for the forthcoming operation. During the morning Kesselring reported that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was fully committed to bomber escort sorties, could not provide air cover for Italian ships and suggested laying mines but the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; had already laid one. The inability of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to provide air cover for the Italian fleet greatly reduced its opportunities to intervene but the light cruiser &quot;Muzio Attendolo&quot; was sent with two destroyers from Naples to Messina.

At an afternoon meeting the surface ships were discussed again, the risk of attack from Malta-based aircraft led Cavallero to decide that the fleet could not be risked without sufficient protection by aircraft. The decision was taken to attack the convoy with submarines between Algiers and the Balearic Islands, torpedo boats between Cap Bon and Pantelleria and then the remnants of the convoy would be finished off by the 3rd and 7th Cruiser divisions General Rino Corso Fougier, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; chief of staff, had reported that 40 modern fighters and bombers were available and that the day before, 101 aircraft had transferred from Italy to Sardinia and Sicily, bringing the total to 247 but &quot;Superaereo&quot; would not begin attacks until 13 August. Radio-controlled bombers would be used to crash onto the aircraft carriers and bombers from Crete and 10 torpedo-bombers from the training school at Grosseto had flown to Sardinia. In Sicily, crews resting from operations were alerted and six Bf 110 long-range fighters were sent from Africa, bringing the Axis total to 

==Battle==

===9/10 August===

&quot;Force R&quot; left Gibraltar on 9 August, ready to meet the convoy at a rendezvous south of Majorca; &quot;Force F&quot; made an uneventful passage of the Straits in dense fog during the night of Fishing boats and one merchant vessel were passed at close quarters but due to the moonless night and the fog, Syfret thought it improbable that the force had been sighted from the shore. &quot;Abwehr&quot; agents near Gibraltar and Ceuta &quot;had&quot; sighted the convoy and the British decrypted their Enigma messages, learning how well-informed the Axis were and of their plans to defeat the convoy. At about 08:00 on 10 August, German reconnaissance aircraft detected the convoy and at 12:45 reported that the convoy was about north of Algiers.

At 17:00 a French aircraft reported two aircraft carriers, two battleships, two cruisers, fourteen destroyers and twelve merchant vessels about north of Oran. &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; reconnaissance aircraft reported at 19:00 that a convoy of two battleships, two carriers, two cruisers, fourteen destroyers and twelve merchantmen was on an easterly course, north-north-east of Oran. By the afternoon of 10 August, Kesselring and &quot;Supermarina&quot; were aware that a convoy of forty to fifty ships, including possibly two carriers and nineteen freighters, was in the western Mediterranean, sailing on an easterly course at a speed of . The convoy was expected to be south of Majorca by 06:00 on 11 August and south of Sardinia by the same time on 12 August. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II in the western Mediterranean was alerted and &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; X was ordered to reconnoitre the eastern Mediterranean beyond the 25° E line of longitude after dawn on 11 August.

===11 August===

Despite Axis submarines, three cruisers and twenty-six destroyers refuelled from the tankers &quot;Dingledale&quot; and &quot;Brown Ranger&quot; of &quot;Force R&quot; by dawn. (Previous Malta convoys had refuelled on arrival but now the island had no oil to spare.) The convoy was south of the Balearic Islands on course for Cap Bon at daybreak and at about 06:20, a U-boat sighted the convoy. At 08:15 a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; reconnaissance aircraft reported that the convoy was north-west of Algiers; fifteen minutes later, a began to shadow the convoy at and continued throughout the day. At noon, the convoy was about south of Majorca, sailing due east on a zigzag course. &quot;Furious&quot; conducted the flying off between 12:30 and 15:15 of 38 Spitfires for the journey to Malta and then turned round with her escorts for Gibraltar (37 of the aircraft reached Malta).
Enigma decrypts showed that at 11:55, the light cruisers &quot;Eugenio di Savoia&quot;, &quot;Raimondo Montecuccoli&quot;, &quot;Muzio Attendolo&quot; of the 7th Cruiser Division at Cagliari had been ordered by &quot;Supermarina&quot; to be at two hours&#x27; notice from 18:00 and that with the heavy cruisers &quot;Gorizia&quot;, &quot;Bolzano&quot; and &quot;Trieste&quot; of the 3rd Cruiser Division at Messina, had been informed at 13:00 that Italian submarines were operating north of Bizerte. Three Axis submarines were seen departing Cagliari at 20:45 and the British learned that at 18:00 the 7th Cruiser Division with seventeen destroyers, had sailed east and that the 3rd Cruiser Division had departed from Messina and Naples. Allied intelligence also learned that &quot;Panzerarmee Afrika&quot; in Egypt believed that the convoy was a threat to Tobruk. Kesselring thought that a landing on the North African coast might be attempted and next day issued an order of the day that landings by the Allies would influence operations in Africa and must be prevented. &quot;Luftgau Afrika&quot; (Air District Africa) expected a landing at Tripoli on 

At 08:00, sighted ships out of range but behind them another group of merchantmen were followed by the carrier &quot;Eagle&quot;. She was able to manoeuvre within and fire four torpedoes which hit &quot;Eagle&quot; at 13:15, sinking the ship eight minutes later south of Cape Salinas, north of Algiers. The destroyers , and the tug &quot;Jaunty&quot; rescued of the complement of and all but four Sea Hurricanes (in the air during the sinking) were lost, about of the fighter cover for the convoy. The German submarine escaped, possibly due to layers of the sea being at different temperatures, affecting the ships&#x27; ASDIC and after the torpedoing there were frequent false alarms. At 14:30 a , one of ten 122 aircraft that had shadowed the convoy from 10:10, flew a reconnaissance sortie over the convoy, too high for the Sea Hurricanes to intercept. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; attacked just after sunset at 20:56, when the convoy was about from Sardinia, with bombers and three He 111 torpedo-bombers. The Heinkels flew low to drop torpedoes and the attacked out of the dusk in shallow dives, that evaded the fighters but anti-aircraft fire from the convoy shot down two for no loss and then damaged several British fighters as they landed on. During the night the Axis airfields in Sardinia were attacked by B-24 Liberators and Beaufighters, which set a hangar on fire and destroyed several aircraft; a commando raid the same night on airfield in Sicily failed.

====Night, 11/12 August====

On the night of the Italian 7th and 3rd Cruiser divisions and 17 destroyers sailed from Cagliari, Messina and Naples to engage the British convoy. The RAF at the Malta Operations Room sent orders in plain language to a Wellington bomber that dropped flares and sent messages in clear, supposedly guiding a fictitious B-24 Liberator force, to bluff the Italian ships away from the convoy. ( had cancelled the operation before the British signals were received, because of a lack of air cover.) At 00:20, the British discovered from Enigma that Italian intelligence had sighted four British cruisers and ten destroyers and thought that part of the convoy might be proceeding to the eastern Mediterranean. Enigma also revealed operation orders from II to the fighters of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77) at Elmas in Sardinia, to expect a convoy in the Sicilian Narrows early on 12 August. II was to co-operate with the in Sicily and Sardinia, flying in waves with fighter escorts against the convoy.

British intelligence concluded that the convoy and its huge escort force had caused the Axis commanders to be apprehensive of a landing anywhere along the North African coast or on Crete. Axis precautionary measures had been taken on the assumption that if Crete was the target, landings would occur before 14 August. Defensive measures were also taken in the Benghazi–Tripoli area of Libya, where a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and the long-range bombers based at Derna were alerted to move to Benghazi or Tripoli, supported by Ju 52 transport aircraft. prepared detachments to repel landings and moved forces to the Sollum–Mersa Matruh area, to defend the coast east of Tobruk. At 07:00, all ship movements from North Africa to Italy and the Aegean were suspended and by late afternoon, the British knew that the anticipated a landing at Tripoli on 13 or 14 August. Fighter and dive-bomber reinforcements were sent from Sicily and Enigma intercepted a message from Hermann Göring, the commander in chief of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, ordering that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;

and that the attacks were to be directed against the British aircraft carriers and merchantmen. At 00:54, , part of the escort force for &quot;Furious&quot;, had been detached with four more destroyers for anti-submarine patrols after the loss of &quot;Eagle&quot;, detected a submarine at , accelerated, obtained a visual contact at and rammed the Italian submarine at , sinking the submarine with all hands.

===12 August===

====Morning====

Axis aircraft resumed shadowing at 05:00 and at 06:10, &quot;Indomitable&quot; sent Martlets to shoot down two reconnaissance aircraft, which proved too high and too fast to intercept. Four Sea Hurricanes and Fulmars took off from the two carriers for air cover and every aircraft was readied to fly. German reconnaissance aircraft kept watch on the convoy, flying too high and fast for the FAA fighters. At 09:15, when the convoy was about south-south-west of dive-bombers of &quot;Lehrgeschwader&quot; 1 (&quot;LG&quot; 1) were intercepted out. Four were shot down and another two were claimed by navy anti-aircraft gunners (German records showed five shot down and two lost over Sardinia from mechanical failure) for the loss of one FAA fighter. The German crews made extravagant claims but did little damage and three Italian reconnaissance aircraft were also shot down. Beaufighters returning from a raid on Sardinia saw the 7th Cruiser Division (Da Zara) at sea and raised the alarm. The cruisers had sailed from Cagliari into the Tyrrhenian Sea at 08:10 on 11 August, escorted by the destroyers , and , to rendezvous with &quot;Muzio Attendolo&quot; from Naples.

Early on 12 August, &quot;Trieste&quot; sailed from Genoa for Naples with the and a torpedo-boat, , to join the 3rd Cruiser Division, which had left Messina early with the cruisers &quot;Gorizia&quot;, &quot;Bolzano&quot; and six destroyers after receiving a signal from that four cruisers and ten destroyers (MG 3) were close to Crete. The Italian cruisers and destroyers rendezvoused north of Ustica off Palermo at the west end of Sicily, some of the ships being short of fuel and then moved south in two squadrons, preceded by the torpedo-boats and &quot;Centauro&quot;. British reconnaissance aircraft from Malta had flown over Italian ports, a Spitfire pilot saw that the 3rd Cruiser Division had left port and at 18:54 a Baltimore crew saw the Italian ships rendezvous. On Malta, Park was not disturbed until the convoy and escort losses of the day, which depleted &quot;Force X&quot;; five Wellington bombers were sent to find the Italian cruisers and 15 Beaufort torpedo-bombers and fifteen Beaufighters stood by.
The biggest convoy attack came around noon from Sardinia-based aircraft; a wave of ten SM.84 bombers from 38° and eight CR.42s of 24° &quot;Gruppo CT&quot; flying as bombers with 14 MC.202 escorts, followed after five minutes by nine Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s and ten SM.84 torpedo bombers attacking the starboard side of the convoy, escorted by 12 Re.2001 fighters and 21 SM.79s and 12 Re.2001s from the port side, all the bombers aiming for the merchant ships. The second wave had been delayed by 15 minutes due to a shortage of mechanics for the Re.2001s and only 31 aircraft could take off. The bombers were met by an anti-aircraft barrage, the merchantmen took evasive action and none was hit by the bombers that managed to get into range. The third wave comprised a pair of Re.2001G/V fighter-bombers from the (Special Section), intended to carry low-altitude armour-piercing bombs. The bombs were not ready and the aircraft carried anti-personnel bombs; the fighter-bombers were accompanied by a special radio-controlled SM.79, loaded with a bomb and directed by Ferdinando Raffaelli in a Cant Z1007b11.

The wave was escorted by two of the five G.50 fighters of the 24° &quot;Gruppo CT&quot; which managed to find the formation. Rafaelli in the Z.1007 guiding the bomb by radio. The radio failed and the SM.79 flew straight on, instead of diving onto an aircraft carrier as intended and crashed into Mount Khenchela in Algeria. The was mistaken for a Hurricane formation and both hit &quot;Victorious&quot;, one bomb killing six sailors and wounding two, the other bouncing off the deck and exploding over the sea. The first ten SM.84 bombers carried electric torpedoes which were designed to travel in an increasing spiral. The torpedoes were dropped from the ships, which used the evasive manoeuvres practised in Operation Berserk to escape.

Between the second and third waves of &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; aircraft, 37 Ju 88s from &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 54 (KG 54) and &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 77 (KG 77) attacked, having flown from Sicily with 21 Bf 109 fighter escorts, after using radio-countermeasures to blind the British radar on Malta. Five aircraft had turned back with mechanical failures but the rest evaded four Fulmars. was hit and forced out of the convoy, escorted by . The number of Axis aircraft in the attacks was unprecedented, with and sorties for only meagre results. Two bombers, a torpedo-bomber and a fighter had been lost for one hit on &quot;Victorious&quot; and the damage to &quot;Deucalion&quot;. The quantity of anti-aircraft fire had led many aircrew to release their bombs and torpedoes early; the Italian aircraft from Sardinia could refuel and rearm to attack again and a Cant Z1007 and several &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft continued to shadow the convoy.

Enigma decrypts showed the British that at 18:30 on 12 August, an S-boat flotilla was due to sail at 16:00 from Porto Empedocle in Sicily for Cap Bon to operate in the area until about 04:30 on 13 August. At 21:45, a &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II assessment revealed that the Axis thought that there were fifty-one ships in the western Mediterranean, including two carriers, two battleships, seven cruisers and twenty destroyers. The Germans mistakenly thought that a US was present but correctly identified &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;Nelson&quot;. The convoy was thought to consist of of , protected by ten to sixteen fighters and plenty of anti-aircraft guns. The was driven off by destroyers and at 09:30 a Sunderland flying boat damaged off Algiers. At 13:34 another Sunderland from 202 Squadron caused more damage but &quot;Giada&quot; shot down the flying boat before heading for Valencia (until 14 August) with one dead and eight wounded crewmen on board.

====Afternoon====

The convoy was approached at 16:30 by &quot;Emo&quot;, which manoeuvred into position to fire torpedoes at a carrier from ; a sudden course change led Franco to change targets, launch four torpedoes and dive. The convoy had changed course again and the torpedoes missed; observers on &quot;Tartar&quot; saw the torpedo tracks and raised the alarm. &quot;Lookout&quot; sped towards a periscope, which was that of &quot;Avorio&quot; moving into an attack position, and forced it to dive, spoiling its attack; at 17:40, &quot;Lookout&quot; returned to the convoy. At 16:49 &quot;Cobalto&quot; was depth charged by while at periscope depth, forced to the surface, engaged by gunfire and rammed by &quot;Ithuriel&quot;, sinking at 17:02. &quot;Ithuriel&quot; lost two crewmen who had boarded &quot;Cobalto&quot; to try keep the submarine afloat; two Italian seamen were lost and the rest were rescued by the British. &quot;Ithuriel&quot; was badly damaged, lost its Asdic, was slowed to and had to make for Gibraltar. Syfret had two destroyers on each flank of the convoy drop depth charges every ten minutes to deter submarines. &quot;Force F&quot; entered the Italian submarine ambush area C and just after 16:00 obtained an ASDIC contact on &quot;Granito&quot;, forced it away with five depth charges but then had to return to the convoy. (Many submarine alarms were possibly caused by ghost Asdic contacts, due to the warm waters of the Mediterranean.) 

The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; units based in Sardinia managed to prepare eight Cr.42 dive-bombers and an escort of nine Re.2001 from 362° and nine SM.79 bombers from Decimomannu. The SM.79s failed to find the convoy and a Re.2001 was shot down by an 806 Squadron Martlet from &quot;Indomitable&quot;. The convoy crossed the 10th parallel, beyond which aircraft based in Sicily could fly with fighter escorts and 105 aircraft prepared to attack in three waves. Problems with the fighter escorts were encountered because the Re.2001s of the 2° had escorted the Sardinia-based bombers and landed in Sardinia, making them unavailable until the next day. The torpedo- and dive-bombers were sent to Pantelleria to fly with the 51° (MC.202s) and avoid the problems of co-ordination when aircraft flew from different bases. Four aircraft were sent on reconnaissance sorties; four of the Italian Ju 87s of 102° were found to lack long-range tanks and torpedoes could not be attached to six SM.84s. Fulmars from &quot;Victorious&quot; shot down a SM.79 on reconnaissance but a Cant Z1007 maintained contact. II arranged to co-ordinate with the Italians but the operations were independent. I , &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; 3 (StG 3) had transferred from Trapani to Elmas and at 17:30 hrs, 20 Ju 87s with Bf 109 escorts took off.

====Evening====

Italian Ju 87s of 102° arrived in poor visibility but at 18:35 the clouds parted. The Italian formation had been detected by radar while out and three Martlets, twelve Sea Hurricanes and three Fulmars were airborne but faced MC.202 and Bf 109 escorts, the best Axis fighters. The dive- and torpedo-bomber attacks were well synchronised, the Ju 87s diving as the torpedo bombers approached in three waves at . The Ju 87s managed a near miss on &quot;Rodney&quot; with the bomb exploding in the sea, one &quot;Stuka&quot; being shot down by a Hurricane and one by anti-aircraft fire. As the ships manoeuvred to evade the torpedo-bombers, another wave of Ju 87s arrived at and bombed &quot;Indomitable&quot; from out of the sun, hit the flight deck twice and near-missed three times, with bombs, killing fifty and wounding 59 men and seriously damaging the ship, which caught fire and slowed to , leaving &quot;Victorious&quot; as the last operational carrier. By 20:30, &quot;Indomitable&quot; had worked up to but the damage to the flight deck left it out of action. Aircraft landed on &quot;Victorious&quot; but those that could not be accommodated were thrown overboard.

&quot;Charybdis&quot;, &quot;Lookout&quot;, &quot;Lightning&quot; and &quot;Somali&quot; gave assistance to &quot;Indomitable&quot; and the SM.79 torpedo-bombers were met with concentrated anti-aircraft fire. Twelve of the SM.79s managed to drop torpedoes, at the long range of ; was hit on the stern, sending crewmen flying through the air. The ship was scuttled the following day. A final Axis attack with twelve SM.79s and 28 Ju 87s cost two Ju 87s shot down and two damaged for no Allied loss; after returning to Pantelleria, the Axis aircraft were strafed by three Beaufighters, which flamed a fuel depot, destroyed a Ju 52 and damaged two SM79s and an SM.84, also killing an Italian pilot caught on the airfield. The Axis air forces had flown bomber sorties during the day and the Germans claimed that they had damaged an aircraft carrier, a cruiser, a destroyer and a large merchant ship. Both sides over-claimed, the British counted 39 shot-down aircraft against the true figure of 18 Axis aircraft lost; three Fulmars, three Sea Hurricanes and one Martlet had been shot down.

The loss of &quot;Eagle&quot; with its 16 aircraft and the damage to &quot;Indomitable&quot; which kept its 47 more aircraft out of action, reduced the number of operational fighters to eight Sea Hurricanes, three Martlets and 10 Fulmars, as &quot;Force Z&quot; was due to leave the convoy, to remain outside the range of Axis aircraft based in Sardinia. Syfret had intended &quot;Force Z&quot; to turn west upon reaching the Skerki Bank at 19:15 but ordered the turn at 18:55 to get &quot;Indomitable&quot; out of danger. &quot;Rodney&quot; was having boiler trouble which slowed &quot;Force Z&quot; to but because of the number of aircraft involved in the Axis attacks, Syfret thought that there could be no more before dark and that the danger at the Skerki Bank would come from after dawn. About forty minutes after the turn a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; reconnaissance aircraft reported the new course; Pedestal was about from Malta with no local air cover, because of the four Fulmars left for the convoy, one had been shot down and one damaged by Bf 109s. At 18:55, Burrough, with the close escort of &quot;Force X&quot;, continued towards Malta with the merchant ships and &quot;Force R&quot; cruised in the western Mediterranean in case it was needed, until ordered to return to Gibraltar (arriving in the morning of 16 August).

====Night, 12/13 August====

At about 20:00, the convoy manoeuvred from four to two columns to pass through the Skerki Channel, the starboard column with &quot;Kenya&quot; in the lead and &quot;Manchester&quot; sixth back, the port column with &quot;Nigeria&quot; leading and &quot;Carlisle&quot; in the centre, ten destroyers sailing outside the columns. Five Italian submarines were waiting and at 19:38, fired four torpedoes at a freighter from and heard three explosions. The sound of the detonations turned out to be from torpedoes fired by hitting &quot;Nigeria&quot; with 52 men killed, and &quot;Ohio&quot; blowing a hole in its side and starting a fire; the crew put out the fire and were soon able to make . The torpedoing of HMS &quot;Nigeria&quot; and &quot;Cairo&quot; (eventually sunk by the British), the diversion of to become Burrough&#x27;s new flagship and the detachment of four Hunt-class destroyers to stand by the damaged cruisers, temporarily deprived &quot;Force X&quot; of its commander, the two columns of the leaders and deprived the convoy nearly half its escort. On hearing that &quot;Nigeria&quot; and &quot;Cairo&quot;, which were equipped as Fighter Direction ships, had been torpedoed, Syfret ordered &quot;Force Z&quot; to send back HMS &quot;Charybdis&quot;, also fitted for fighter direction, with and to reinforce &quot;Force X&quot;. &quot;Nigeria&quot; and the other damaged ships turned back to Gibraltar, escorted by , and .

&quot;KG&quot; 54 and &quot;KG&quot; 77 dispatched 30 with seven He 111 torpedo-bombers from 6/KG 26 escorted by six Bf 110s of 6/&quot;ZG&quot; 26 and the destroyers were still with the damaged ships and when the raid was detected by radar at 20:35; six long-range Beaufighters of 248 Squadron arrived and were also fired on by the convoy gunners. &quot;Ashanti&quot; and laid a smokescreen to cover the light western horizon, the sun having set at 20:10 but the reduced anti-aircraft firepower of the convoy and escorts failed to prevent the attack. After thirty minutes was stopped, hit in the bows (possibly by the ), eventually to continue at . &quot;Clan Ferguson&quot; was torpedoed and set ablaze, later to be destroyed by an ammunition detonation, &quot;Rochester Castle&quot; was damaged and &quot;Empire Hope&quot; was sunk by a destroyer after rescuing the crew. At 21:05 &quot;Alagi&quot; fired a salvo of four torpedoes at &quot;Kenya&quot;, the tracks of which were seen on &quot;Port Chalmers&quot; and reported. &quot;Kenya&quot; turned sharply and avoided three of the torpedoes but the fourth hit aft on the starboard side; &quot;Kenya&quot; was able to keep up but this left &quot;Force X&quot; with &quot;Manchester&quot; as the only undamaged cruiser. &quot;Bronzo&quot; reported that it had sunk &quot;Deucalion&quot; and the captain of &quot;Kenya&quot; described the state of the convoy as &quot;chaotic&quot;. At 21:30, the commander of &quot;Alagi&quot; reported that he had sunk the merchant ship &quot;Empire Hope&quot; and damaged &quot;Kenya&quot; and that


At 23:56, the convoy passed south of Zembra island towards Kelibia on Cap Bon, to avoid the minefields between Africa and Sicily, still out of formation. Three minesweeping destroyers sailed ahead, followed by the cruisers &quot;Kenya&quot;, &quot;Manchester&quot; and two freighters. &quot;Charybdis&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Eskimo&quot; and &quot;Somali&quot; from &quot;Force Z&quot; were still some hours behind and &quot;Ashanti&quot; was steaming fast to overhaul the main body. Three destroyers remained with nine of the merchantmen and &quot;Bramham&quot; was en route after &quot;Deucalion&quot; had been sunk. The main part of the convoy was attacked at 00:40 by four boats of the German III Squadron and 13 torpedo boats of the Italian 18° &quot;MAS&quot;, 2° &quot;MS&quot; and 20° &quot;MAS&quot;, which made 15 attacks; the long line of merchant ships and the reduced number of escort ships providing an easy target. The 18° &quot;MAS&quot; detected the convoy on radar, south-east of Pantelleria and attacked the escorts at the head of the procession, coming under fire, as they fired torpedoes to no effect. The Italian boats then attacked the merchant ships.

The convoy was vulnerable because the lighthouse at Cap Bon revealed their position about offshore. S 58 and S 59 sighted the first ships at 00:20, attacked and S 58 was damaged, turning away for Porto Empedocle. S 59 attacked and claimed a freighter about north-east of Cap Bon but no ships were hit there. At 01:02 near Ras Mustafa south of Kelibia, MS 16 or MS 22 attacked the convoy to no effect but then attacked &quot;Manchester&quot; from close range and each scored a hit, flooding its boilers, fuel tanks and magazines and wrecking three of its four propeller shafts, the ship taking on a 12° list until counter-flooding reduced the list to 5°. , and &quot;Glenorchy&quot; following on, swerved around &quot;Manchester&quot; and lost formation. &quot;Glenorchy&quot; mistakenly claimed the destruction of a torpedo boat and the two MAS boats ran aground in Tunisia. Power was restored on &quot;Manchester&quot; and 156 men were taken on board &quot;Pathfinder&quot; but at 05:00, the captain ordered the ship be scuttled and the remaining crew to make for the Tunisian coast.

Between 03:15 and 04:30 about off Kelibia, the torpedo boats hit and sank &quot;Wairangi&quot;, &quot;Almeria Lykes&quot; (US), (US) and &quot;Glenorchy&quot;, as they took a short cut to catch up with the convoy. &quot;Rochester Castle&quot; was torpedoed but escaped at and caught up with the main body by 05:30, by when &quot;Charybdis&quot;, &quot;Eskimo&quot; and &quot;Somali&quot; had arrived, increasing the escort to two cruisers and seven destroyers around &quot;Rochester Castle&quot;, &quot;Waimarama&quot; and &quot;Melbourne Star&quot;. &quot;Ohio&quot; and its destroyer were slowly closing the distance and further back were &quot;Port Chalmers&quot; and two destroyers. &quot;Dorset&quot; was sailing independently and &quot;Brisbane Star&quot; lurked near the Tunisian coast, ready to make a run for Malta after dark. Dawn brought an end to the torpedo boat attacks and at 07:30, Burrough sent &quot;Eskimo&quot; and &quot;Somali&quot; back to help &quot;Manchester&quot; but they arrived too late, took on survivors who had not reached the shore and made for Gibraltar.

===13 August===

====Morning====

An attack by the Italian cruisers appeared imminent, after air reconnaissance had sighted them the previous evening, heading south about from the west end of Sicily, on course to reach the convoy at dawn. At 01:30 the cruisers had turned east and run along the north coast of Sicily; British aircraft from Malta had conducted a ruse to decoy the cruisers but the main attacking force on Malta was held back, in case the Italian battleships sailed from Taranto. Some of the Italian cruisers were ordered to return to port and the rest were sent through the Straits of Messina to join the 8th Cruiser Division against the MG 3 decoy convoy in the eastern Mediterranean. had been waiting since 10 August north of the Capo Milazzo lighthouse and after being attacked, moved close to Stromboli, arriving early on 13 August. The Italian cruisers were heard first by hydrophone and then seen through the periscope at 07:25, heading north between the islands of Filicudi and Panarea. The ships were making with eight destroyer escorts and two CANT Z.506 aircraft overhead. Her commander raised the periscope for only short periods, to avoid being seen by the destroyers and the Cants, while manoeuvring into an attack position.

At 08:05, the cruisers slowed to for &quot;Gorizia&quot; to fly off a seaplane and then the destroyer &quot;Fuciliere&quot; machine-gunned a periscope seen at . The Italian destroyers chased several sonar contacts and three sailed within of &quot;Unbroken&quot;, which fired four torpedoes after they had passed by. &quot;Unbroken&quot; dived to and after 2.15 minutes, an explosion was heard followed by a second after another 15 seconds. Observers on &quot;Gorizia&quot; and &quot;Bolzano&quot; had seen torpedo tracks and &quot;Gorizia&quot; was turned sharply but &quot;Bolzano&quot; was hit while beginning its turn. The deck crew of &quot;Muzio Attendolo&quot; had not seen the torpedo tracks or received the alert from &quot;Fuciliere&quot; and the ship took evasive action only after &quot;Bolzano&quot; was hit, which was too late. &quot;Unbroken&quot; descended to and commenced silent running; &quot;Fuciliere&quot; (carrying sonar) and &quot;Camica Nera&quot; slowed to hunt the submarine. The destroyers detected &quot;Unbroken&quot; at 08:45 and accurately dropped 105 depth charges in the next 45 minutes but at too shallow a depth. Two destroyers escorted &quot;Gorizia&quot; and &quot;Trieste&quot; to Messina and five remained with &quot;Bolzano&quot; and &quot;Muzio Attendolo&quot;, periodically dropping depth charges as a deterrent.

&quot;Muzio Attendolo&quot; was hit forward and of its bow was blown open but suffered no fatalities. The ship was towed towards Messina but when the bow fell off, the ship managed to sail on at , escorted by &quot;Grecale&quot;, &quot;Ascari&quot; and later &quot;Freccia&quot;, reaching Messina at 18:54. &quot;Bolzano&quot; was struck amidships, six engine rooms and a magazine flooded and a fire started, the commander of the 11th Destroyer Flotilla being ordered to tow the ship and run it aground on Panarea. &quot;Bolzano&quot; burned until the next day, watched over by Italian fighters and after a month of repairs, was towed to Naples. &quot;Muzio Attendolo&quot; was damaged for the duration of the war. After remaining submerged for ten hours, &quot;Unbroken&quot; surfaced and was recalled to Malta. (&quot;Supermarina&quot; had re-routed the cruiser force after a submarine (&quot;Unbroken&quot;) had been detected, which had been predicted by Mars, enabling him to forestall the Italians, who broke orders by not zigzagging and by slowing. After the incident, &quot;Supermarina&quot; assumed that the submarine had escaped because Italian depth charges were not powerful enough, rather than the sonar-equipped ships had been hampered by the turbulence of destroyer wakes and depth charge explosions.)
At 07:00 the convoy was about from Malta and Axis reconnaissance accurately reported four freighters, two cruisers and seven destroyers but not five more destroyers. Trailing behind were &quot;Dorset&quot; and &quot;Port Chalmers&quot; with two destroyers and two more off to the west. &quot;Brisbane Star&quot; was in the Gulf of Hammamet and six British submarines were south of Pantelleria. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II sent 26 in several waves and at 09:15, 16 Ju 87s escorted by eight Bf 109s and eight Bf 110s attacked. Ten of II/LG 1 near missed &quot;Ohio&quot; and hit &quot;Waimarama&quot; which disintegrated; the aviation fuel on deck burst into flame and one of the bombers was destroyed in the explosion. passed through the fires, rescuing 27 survivors of the ship&#x27;s complement of 107 men.

The wreckage of &quot;Waimarama&quot; showered flaming debris on and several of her crew abandoned ship prematurely, some of whom were later rescued by &quot;Ledbury&quot;. At 09:23, eight Italian Ju 87s with ten MC.202 escorts attacked and a &quot;Stuka&quot; was shot down and crashed onto &quot;Ohio&quot;, another was shot into the sea and a Spitfire was shot down, either by a MC.202 or navy anti-aircraft fire. &quot;Rochester Castle&quot; was damaged by a near miss from a and &quot;Dorset&quot; was hit by &quot;Stukas&quot; of I/StG 3 and abandoned. The attackers lost two Ju 87s and a Bf 109 and a Beaufighter was shot down. &quot;Port Chalmers&quot; was hit and at 11:25, five SM.79 torpedo-bombers, with 14 MC.202 escorts, attacked and the crew found a torpedo caught in the starboard paravane, which exploded harmlessly. An SM.79 was shot down by a Spitfire and two destroyers were left behind with the disabled ships.

====Afternoon====

The remnants of the convoy steamed on to meet the four minesweepers and seven motor minesweepers of the 17th Minesweeper Flotilla of the Malta Escort Force at 14:30. &quot;Melbourne Star&quot;, &quot;Port Chalmers&quot; and &quot;Rochester Castle&quot; reached Grand Harbour at Valletta at 16:30, where Operation Ceres, the immediate unloading of the ships began. Another air attack at dusk by 14 Ju 87s, sank &quot;Dorset&quot; but when the main body was within of Malta, 18 were recalled in the face of 407 Spitfire sorties from the island. &quot;Penn&quot; tried to tow &quot;Ohio&quot; but the tanker was listing and snapped the tow line; in a later attack, a bomb hit the same area as a previous torpedo hit and broke &quot;Ohio&quot;&#x27;s keel. The last ship to arrive, &quot;Brisbane Star&quot; evaded a U-boat and managed to steam at despite the damage to its bows. Off Tunisia, &quot;Brisbane Star&quot; was attacked by two SM.79 torpedo bombers, whose torpedoes turned out to be duds. The ship evaded Italian MAS boats; it was then boarded by the Sousse harbour master, who tried to impound the vessel until persuaded to relent and let the ship sail on after dark. &quot;Ledbury&quot; was attacked by two SM.79s but shot them down. &quot;Force X&quot; had turned for Gibraltar at 16:00 with the cruisers &quot;Charybdis&quot;, &quot;Kenya&quot; and five destroyers; &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; II made a maximum effort against the force, which made it easier for the remaining merchant ships to reach Malta. &quot;Force X&quot; was attacked by 35 and 13 Ju 87s, achieving only a near miss on &quot;Kenya&quot; for a loss of a and a &quot;Stuka&quot;. The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; attacked with 15 bombers and 20 torpedo-bombers for no loss and during the afternoon, &quot;Force X&quot; met &quot;Force Z&quot;, the ships being attacked by aircraft, submarines and light craft; &quot;Foresight&quot; was scuttled by &quot;Tartar&quot; when it could no longer sail. &quot;Eskimo&quot; and &quot;Somali&quot;, carrying survivors from &quot;Manchester&quot; were the last to reach Gibraltar at 17:30 on 15 August.

====Operations MG 3 and MG 4====
In the eastern Mediterranean, the decoy operation MG 3 had begun when convoy MW12 with three freighters had sailed from Port Said after dusk on 10 August. The merchant ships were escorted by two cruisers, ten destroyers and two smaller escorts and another merchant ship escorted by two cruisers and three destroyers left Haifa at 03:00 the next day. The two forces rendezvoused early on 11 August and sailed west to the longitude of Alexandria, then turned back. &quot;U-83&quot; had reported that four cruisers and ten destroyers were close to Crete and a message from a Sunderland was intercepted. Reconnaissance reports from Malta noted a smokescreen over Valletta, apparently to conceal two cruisers; this was later taken to mean that the British were hiding the departure of ships heading westwards towards the convoy. The large size of the convoy was interpreted by &quot;Supermarina&quot; to imply an operation in the eastern Mediterranean and prepared to reinforce the 8th Cruiser Division at Navarino.

German aircraft had spotted the movements and early on 12 August, Kesselring informed &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; X that four merchant vessels, six cruisers and an unknown number of destroyers were at 33° 40&#x27; N, 28° 34&#x27; E, sailing north-east at . Kesselring thought that the convoy was a British wireless-telegraphy spoof but might also be a supply convoy for Malta and &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; X was ordered to reconnoitre all of the eastern Mediterranean on the morning of 12 August but no aircraft were available to cover the Italian cruisers, operations against the convoy taking priority. During the night of 12/13 August, the cruisers and with four destroyers conducted Operation MG 4, a bombardment of Rhodes port on the island of Rhodes. During the day, the RAF attacked Maritsa airfield on Rhodes and a British submarine landed Commandos on the east coast of Sicily (a &quot;False Nose Job&quot;) at Simeto south of Catania, to sabotage electricity pylons. The Italian 8th Cruiser Division remained in port and the Germans detached a destroyer to reinforce the Italians; local traffic along the North African coast and shipping between Italy and Greece was suspended but MG 3 failed to divert Axis attention from Operation Pedestal.

===14–15 August===
On the afternoon of 14 August, &quot;Brisbane Star&quot; arrived at Valletta Harbour with Spitfires circling overhead. &quot;Ohio&quot; was surrounded by ships to nurse the tanker to Grand Harbour and several American volunteers from &quot;Santa Eliza&quot; manned anti-aircraft guns on &quot;Ohio&quot; during the tow. The weight of the tanker kept breaking the tow lines, while constant air attacks were made by 20 bombers that destroyed the rudder, made a hole in her stern and brought the decks awash. The tanker was towed in by the destroyers &quot;Ledbury&quot; and &quot;Penn&quot; lashed on either side, with the minesweeper acting as a stabiliser at the stern. More air attacks disrupted the towing formation, until it was re-established with &quot;Bramham&quot; replacing &quot;Ledbury&quot; for the remainder of the journey.

&quot;Ohio&quot; was towed into Grand Harbour at 09:30 on 15 August, to cheering crowds and a band playing &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;. The crowd fell silent as the ships entered harbour, men removed their hats, women crossed themselves and a bugle sounded &quot;Still&quot;. The tanker discharged oil into two tankers and water was pumped in at the same time, to reduce the chance of structural failure. &quot;Ohio&quot; settled on the bottom just as the last of the fuel was emptied. The surviving ships&#x27; cargo was unloaded in Malta by about 3,000 soldiers before being transferred to guarded stores. Some supplies were looted in the process; the looters included police officers, watchmen, British soldiers and Maltese civilians.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

German reports on 17 August claimed that all the tankers in the recent Mediterranean convoy had been sunk and none of the transports had reached their destination (assumed to be Egypt). The Allies had lost thirteen vessels, including nine merchantmen, one aircraft carrier (&quot;Eagle&quot;), two cruisers (&quot;Manchester&quot; and &quot;Cairo&quot;) and a destroyer (&quot;Foresight&quot;) but the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy had saved Malta. The arrival of about of general cargo, together with petrol, oil fuel, kerosene and diesel fuel, was enough to give the island about ten weeks&#x27; supply beyond the few weeks that the existing stocks would last. Axis propaganda broadcasts made extravagant claims but a &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; report noted the incomplete and contradictory evidence, allowing only a provisional conclusion. The arrival of four merchant ships and a tanker was &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, because the revival of Malta as an offensive base would affect Axis supply routes in what might be the &quot;decisive phase of the struggle for North Africa&quot;. reached the same conclusion and Giuseppe Santoro, deputy chief of staff of the , wrote that the British had achieved a strategic success by bringing Malta back into action &quot;in the final phase of the struggle in Egypt&quot;.

In August, with Malta still besieged, 35 per cent of Axis convoy shipping to North Africa was lost. Later that year, Admiral Eberhard Weichold summed up the view,

In 1994, James Sadkovich wrote that Operation Pedestal was a tactical disaster for the British and that it was of a magnitude comparable to the German attack on Convoy PQ 17. In 2000, Richard Woodman called Operation Pedestal a strategic victory, raising the morale of the people and garrison of Malta, averting famine and an inevitable surrender. In 2002, Giorgio Giorgerini wrote that the operation was an Italian success; Italian submarines had adopted more offensive tactics and sunk a cruiser and two merchantmen, damaged two cruisers and the tanker &quot;Ohio&quot;. In 2002, Jack Greene and Alessandro Massignani called the convoy operation the last Axis victory in the Mediterranean but that it was a tactical not a strategic success. The arrival of &quot;Ohio&quot; justified the convoy despite the loss of nine of the merchant ships (one in Valletta harbour). Axis shipping had been suspended during the operation, partly because the transport &quot;Ogaden&quot; had been sunk off Derna on 12 August, by and after &quot;Ohio&quot; arrived, Axis ships had to make longer journeys. On 15 August, &quot;Lerici&quot; was also sunk by &quot;Porpoise&quot; and on 17 August, &quot;Pilo&quot; was sunk by aircraft and the tanker &quot;Pozarica&quot; was sunk on 21 August.

===Casualties===
In 2003, Ian Malcolm listed 160 men killed on &quot;Eagle&quot;, 132 on &quot;Manchester&quot;, 52 on &quot;Nigeria&quot;, 50 on &quot;Indomitable&quot;, 24 on &quot;Cairo&quot;, five on &quot;Foresight&quot;, three men on &quot;Kenya&quot;. Merchant Navy casualties were 83 on &quot;Waimarama&quot;, eighteen on &quot;Clan Ferguson&quot;, 7 on &quot;Glenorchy&quot;, 5 on &quot;Melbourne Star&quot;, 4 on &quot;Santa Elisa&quot;, 1 on &quot;Deucalion&quot;, 1 on &quot;Ohio&quot; and 1 on &quot;Brisbane Star&quot;. 

&quot;Ohio&quot; never sailed again and the British lost the carrier &quot;Eagle&quot;, the cruisers &quot;Manchester&quot; and &quot;Cairo&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Foresight&quot;. The carrier &quot;Indomitable&quot;, the cruisers &quot;Nigeria&quot; and &quot;Kenya&quot; and three destroyers were damaged and under repair for some time. On the Axis side, the Italian cruisers &quot;Bolzano&quot; and &quot;Muzio Attendolo&quot; were damaged and not operational for the rest of the war, the Italian submarines &quot;Cobalto&quot; and &quot;Dagabur&quot; were sunk, the Italian submarine &quot;Giada&quot; and the German E-Boat &quot;S58&quot; were damaged.

 II sent against Pedestal from 11 to 14 August and claimed twelve aircraft shot down for eighteen losses. Total Axis losses were 62 aircraft, 42 Italian and 19 German, including losses on the ground and those shot down by their own side. Royal Navy gunners and FAA fighters claimed 74 aircraft shot down, against post-war data that they destroyed 42 Axis aircraft, 26 from the and 16 aircraft. The FAA lost 13 aircraft on operations and 16 Sea Hurricanes when &quot;Eagle&quot; was sunk, the RAF lost a Beaufighter and five Spitfires; a Sunderland was shot down by &quot;Giada&quot;. The Allies could not risk such losses again and another large convoy to Malta was not attempted until November 1942, when the re-capture of airfields in Egypt and Libya after the Second Battle of El Alamein made it much easier to provide land-based air cover.

===Subsequent operations===

From 16 to 18 August, made another Club Run from Gibraltar and dispatched to Malta in Operation Baritone. In September and October, Malta was supplied by the submarines (, on the Magic Carpet run and sailed during the operation with ammunition, aviation fuel and torpedoes). The submarines , &quot;Clyde&quot;, and made more Magic Carpet runs and the fast minelayer &quot;Welshman&quot; made a dash from Gibraltar with of food. In September, with Malta revictualled, Allied forces sank of Axis shipping, including of fuel destined for Rommel, leaving the Axis forces in Egypt consuming supplies faster than receipts, contributing to tactical paralysis during the Second Battle of El Alamein and Operation Torch 

Submarines and Beaufort torpedo-bombers, escorted by Beaufighters, regularly attacked Axis supply ships, concentrating on tankers, known to the Allies through Ultra intercepts. An attempt to run a disguised merchant ship to Malta early in November failed and then Operation Stoneage a convoy of four merchant ships from Alexandria, arrived undamaged (the light cruiser &quot;Arethusa&quot; was torpedoed with 155 men killed and had to be towed back to port). &quot;Force K&quot; was re-established at Malta and in Operation Portcullis five ships were dispatched and arrived safely. Chariot manned torpedoes began to operate from Malta that month and from late December to January 1943, four convoys, Quadrangle A, B, C and D, with pairs of merchantmen in each, delivered of stores without loss; empty ships were retrieved from the island.

==Commemoration==
In recognition of their fortitude during the siege and air attacks during all of the Mediterranean campaign, Malta was awarded the George Cross in the months immediately preceding this operation. Syfret was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath for his &quot;bravery and dauntless resolution in fighting an important convoy through to Malta in the face of relentless attacks by day and night from enemy submarines, aircraft, and surface forces&quot;. The master of the tanker &quot;Ohio&quot;, Dudley Mason, was awarded the George Cross for showing &quot;skill and courage of the highest order and it was due to his determination that, in spite of the most persistent enemy opposition, the vessel, with her valuable cargo, eventually reached Malta and was safely berthed&quot;. Several other men of the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy, including the commander of &quot;Ledbury&quot;, Roger Hill, received military awards ranging from the Distinguished Service Order and Conspicuous Gallantry Medal to Mentioned in Despatches, for the bravery shown in ferrying the merchantmen to Malta. The United States&#x27; Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal was awarded to Junior Third Officer Frederick August Larsen, Jr. and to Cadet-Midshipman, US Merchant Marine Academy, Francis A. Dales for &quot;Heroism beyond the call of duty&quot; for their conduct aboard the &quot;Santa Elisa&quot; and &quot;Ohio&quot;. Operation &quot;Pedestal&quot; was the subject of a 1953 black and white British film, &quot;Malta Story&quot;, that interspersed archive footage of &quot;Ohio&quot; with scripted studio scenes.

<text>Bimini is the westernmost district of the Bahamas and comprises a chain of islands located about due east of Miami. Bimini is the closest point in the Bahamas to the mainland United States and approximately west-northwest of Nassau. The population is 2,417 as of the 2022 census.

==Geography==

Bimini&#x27;s largest islands are North Bimini, South Bimini, and East Bimini. Smaller islands in the Bimini chain include Gun Cay, North Cat Cay, South Cat Cay, and Ocean Cay. The District of Bimini also includes Cay Sal Bank, more than further south, which is geographically not a part of the Bimini Islands but a separate unit. 

North Bimini is about long and wide. Its main settlement is Alice Town, a collection of shops, restaurants, and bars on a road known as &quot;The King&#x27;s Highway&quot;. The second major road is called Queens Highway and runs almost the length of the island parallel to Kings Highway.

As a low-lying island, rising sea levels may cause the entire island to become submerged.

South Bimini (pop. 182) houses an airstrip, South Bimini Airport, and offers a quiet alternative to the slow bustle of North Bimini. There is a small community of homes on South Bimini known as Port Royale. For many years, South Bimini tourists were limited to boaters because there were few accommodations other than private homes.

Because Bimini is close to Miami, Florida, many American anglers go to the islands by boat to fish or to enjoy the local nightlife. Scuba diving and snorkeling are also popular activities, as there are many shipwrecks in the area, such as the wreck of the , which ran aground in 1926 during a hurricane. The top of the ship is exposed to the air while the bottom half is submerged. Parts of the wreck were stripped over the years and some of the wood was used in the construction of the Compleat Angler Hotel and bar on North Bimini.

==History==
The first inhabitants on the island were the Lucayans, and the name &quot;Bimini&quot; means &quot;two islands&quot; or &quot;the twins&quot; in the Lucayan language.

Bimini is home to several landmarks said to contain mystical properties of obscure origins. Much of the historical data about these places is speculative in nature, and experts in various fields have opined across the full spectrum of explanation. The most contentious of these sites is Bimini Road. 

During the period of Prohibition in the United States, Bimini was a favorite haven and supply point for the rum-running trade. Some claim that the term &quot;the real McCoy&quot; was applied to the rum provided by William McCoy, who used Bimini to transport whiskey to the U.S. during Prohibition, although the phrase pre-dates the Prohibition Era, first recorded in the U.S. in 1908 – and the phrase is the subject of numerous fanciful folk etymologies.

Chalk&#x27;s International Airlines operated seaplane flights between Miami Harbor and the Bahamas from 1917, so the company was an island institution for generations. As goods on the island were expensive because of shipping costs, many locals used Chalk&#x27;s flights to buy cheaper goods in Florida and take the goods to Bimini. 

A seaplane operated by Miami Airways ditched into the sea off the coast of Bimini on March 22, 1922. All five passengers subsequently drowned. A Grumman Turbo Mallard of Flight 101 was en route to Bimini when it crashed on December 19, 2005, killing all 18 passengers and two crew; at least 11 of the passengers were Bimini residents.

On January 13, 2006, one of the more famous establishments in Bimini, the Compleat Angler Hotel, was destroyed by fire. The bar is remembered for the photographs and memorabilia of Ernest Hemingway that lined its walls and were lost in the fire, which also took the life of owner Julian Brown.

The final scene of the 1991 film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was shot in Alice Town.

=== The Fountain of Youth ===

Juan Ponce de León and his search for the Fountain of Youth included references to Bimini (&quot;Beniny&quot;). Arawak and/or Taíno spoke of a land called Beimini where the fountain could be found. Although the location was erroneously associated with the Bahamas, the natives referred to a location in the Gulf of Honduras. Although de León&#x27;s expedition brought him to Florida, the fountain was rumored to exist within the shallow pools of South Bimini. Today there is a small freshwater well with a plaque commemorating the Fountain of Youth, on the road leading to the South Bimini Airport.

Found within the brackish mangrove swamp that covers of the shoreline of North Bimini is &quot;The Healing Hole&quot;, a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, mineral-laden fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago, it is especially high in calcium and magnesium.

== Endemic species ==
Bimini is home to several unique, endemic and threatened species. The Bimini Boa (&quot;Epicrates striatus fosteri&quot;), protected by Bahamian law, is the largest of the terrestrial reptiles on Bimini. The Bimini Ameiva (&quot;Ameiva auberi richmondi&quot;) is a very common, fast-moving lizard on the island. The smalltooth sawfish (&quot;Pristis pectinata&quot;) is one of the rarest fish in the world, sometimes listed as a critically endangered species by conservation groups.

The Bimini Biological Field Station (BBFS) has captured and recorded 13 species of sharks in the shallow waters around Bimini. However, the number of sharks around the island is higher, considering the sharks of the deep waters off Bimini&#x27;s western shores. Along with the species featured below, the BBFS has witnessed and recorded captures of shortfin mako (&quot;Isurus oxyrinchus&quot;), bigeye thresher (&quot;Alopias superciliosus&quot;), spiny dogfish (&quot;Squalus acanthias&quot;), and sixgill (&quot;Hexanchus&quot; sp.) sharks .

== Bimini Biological Field Station (Shark Lab) ==
The Shark Lab is a world-famous facility owned and operated by shark biologist Dr. Samuel Gruber. The Shark Lab offers internships in marine biology to people interested in shark research and the conservation of the ocean&#x27;s ecosystems. Located on South Bimini Island, it has done much research regarding the lemon shark.

== Politics ==
For elections to the Parliament of the Bahamas, it is part of the West Grand Bahama and Bimini constituency.

==Notable residents==
Ernest Hemingway lived on Bimini from 1935 to 1937, staying at the Compleat Angler Hotel. He worked on &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; and wrote a few articles, but mostly he fished aboard his boat &quot;Pilar&quot;, trolling the deep blue offshore waters for marlin, tuna and swordfish. Hemingway was attracted to Bimini by tales of the incredible fishing available in the Gulf Stream, the legendary “river” of warm water that rushes north past the Bahamas. An Atlantic blue marlin with a mass of caught off Bimini allegedly inspired Hemingway to write &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; and &quot;Islands in The Stream&quot;.

While not a resident of the islands, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited in 1964 and worked on his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech while there.

South Bimini was home to Colonel Joseph C. Mackey, the founder of Mackey Airlines, which was later bought by Eastern Airlines. He built a home on the southern tip of South Bimini. This structure would become the &quot;Sunshine Inn&quot; and is currently a bar and restaurant, though the hotel was damaged by a hurricane and was subsequently demolished.

Among Port Royale&#x27;s notable residents was Adam Clayton Powell Jr., who was excluded from the U.S. House of Representatives because of allegations that he misappropriated committee funds for personal use. He stayed in Bimini from January 1967 to April 1969 in self-imposed exile until the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally when it excluded Powell, a duly elected member. In 1972, Powell died of cancer in Miami. Following his funeral in New York, his ashes were taken to Bimini and scattered in the waters surrounding the islands.

There is rumor of the famed Chicano civil rights lawyer, Oscar Zeta Acosta, of &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; fame potentially meeting his end after returning from the island of Bimini to Key Biscayne in 1974 during a failed attempt to smuggle drugs. According to the story told to Hunter S. Thompson, upon their boat nearly reaching the shoreline of the southern tip Key Biscayne, Acosta and his companions were ambushed when they suddenly found themselves surrounded by bright lights from boats that &quot;appeared out of nowhere&quot;. Gunfire erupted and one of Acosta&#x27;s companions was immediately killed by being shot in the head. Acosta, acting quickly, floored the boat&#x27;s throttle and plowed into and over one of the ambusher&#x27;s boats and, upon making it to shore, he grabbed a small suitcase likely containing drugs and ran off inland into the island. The veracity of this story was deemed questionable by Thompson, as he had heard it secondhand from the individual whose boat Acosta had borrowed for the smuggling attempt. This came to represent one of a number of possible Acosta sightings that Thompson had been told of, which he would term &quot;buffalo sightings&quot;, from all around the world following Acosta&#x27;s official disappearance in 1974 under suspicious circumstances. 

In May 1987, Colorado Senator Gary Hart&#x27;s presidential bid was derailed after media reports exposed a relationship with model Donna Rice. A well known photo of Rice sitting on Hart&#x27;s lap on one of Bimini&#x27;s docks was published by the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; after Hart suspended his presidential campaign.

Jody Weech, Miss Commonwealth Bahamas 1992, was from Bimini. She made the Top 10 in the Miss World contest in Sun City, South Africa. She received the title Miss World Caribbean.

==Bimini Bay Resort controversy==
In May 2008 marine conservationist Jean-Michel Cousteau criticized Bimini Bay Resort, now Resorts World Bimini by Hilton, calling it a &quot;catastrophe&quot; and announcing, &quot;allowing Bimini Bay to continue with phase II would certainly strip this island paradise of its precious natural riches. Over time, visitors and residents alike will suffer the decline of economic, social and environmental prosperity.&quot;

<text>The Association of Junior Leagues International, Inc. (Junior League or JL) is a private, nonprofit educational women&#x27;s volunteer organization aimed at improving communities and the social, cultural, and political fabric of civil society. With 298 Junior League chapters in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom as of 2024, it is one of the oldest and largest of its kind. Members engage in developing civic leadership skills, fundraising, and volunteering on committees to support partner community organizations related to foster children, domestic violence, human trafficking, illiteracy, city beautification, and other issues. Its mission is to advance women&#x27;s leadership for meaningful community impact through volunteer action, collaboration, and training.

It was founded in 1901 in New York City by Barnard College debutante Mary Harriman Rumsey.

==History==

The first Junior League was founded in 1901 in New York City as the Junior League for the Promotion of the Settlement Movement. This original chapter is now known as the New York Junior League (NYJL). Its founder was then 19-year-old Barnard College student and debutante Mary Harriman Rumsey, sister of future Governor of New York W. Averell Harriman and daughter of railroad executive Edward H. Harriman.

Inspired by a lecture on settlement movements that chronicled the works of social reformers such as Lillian Wald and Jane Addams, Harriman Rumsey organized others to become involved in settlement work. The organization&#x27;s first project was working at the College Settlement on Rivington Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. These were the early days of privileged young girls and women leaving their sheltered lives in wealthy neighborhoods to volunteer their time with those who lived in crowded, poverty-stricken areas of cities. This started a legacy of volunteering and social activism that would continue for many decades.

For many years the NYJL&#x27;s clubhouse was located at 221 East 71st Street in Manhattan. Designed by architect John Russell Pope and opened in 1929, the building contained a swimming pool on the top floor, bedrooms for volunteers, a ballroom, a hairdressing salon, and a shelter for up to 20 abandoned babies. Marymount Manhattan College currently owns the building. In 1950 the NYJL clubhouse moved to the former Vincent Astor townhouse (Astor House) at 130 East 80th Street, where it remains as of 2020.

The League quickly branched out and in 1907 became the Junior League for the Promotion of Neighborhood Work. Under President Dorothy Whitney, the League introduced formal training on &quot;social problems&quot; and expanded the scope of their work to include civic issues such as the civic role for women, police, and immigration (100 Years, 25–26). During this time, a number of sister leagues formed in cities including Brooklyn, New York and Portland, Oregon although there was no formal affiliation with the first New York league. A number of other debutante circles, like the Sewing Circle League of Boston began to emulate the League in New York and focus on local social issues (100 Years, 26). Eleanor Roosevelt was an early member of the NYJL, joining in 1903 when she was 19 years old.

In 1921, thirty Leagues joined to form a national association. Until this point, Leagues were only connected by a Bulletin, containing updates about various leagues, and an annual conference. The national association was named the Association of Junior Leagues of America, Inc. and acted as an umbrella organization (Volunteer, 61). A new Constitution was written, and the Board was tasked with acting as an information bureau for the leagues, as well as continuing to publish the Bulletin and coordinating the annual meeting (100 Years, 47.) After serving as New York City&#x27;s Junior League president from 1907 to 1910, Dorothy Payne Whitney was nominated as the first president of AJLA. Despite the name, there was membership of Leagues located both in America and Canada at the time of the incorporation (100 Years, 61).

AJLA continued to expand in the number of Leagues and in programming. By the middle of the 20th century there were over 150 Junior Leagues located in the United States, Canada, and Mexico (100 Years, 10). There was also a noticeable demographic shift in League members. More and more league members were young, working women or were older, suburban housewives as opposed to debutantes (100 Years, 94). In 1985, a Junior League was established in London which was the first League established outside of North America (100 Years, 154–155). This prompted a name change with the organization official becoming the Association of Junior Leagues International, Inc. (History Timeline).

===Voluntarism===
The idea that women can meaningfully contribute to solving social issues and bettering communities through voluntarism has been a core tenet of the Junior League since its conception. In the Junior League’s 1906 Annual Report, Harriman Rumsey emphasized the organization’s imperative to alleviate civic ills: &quot;It seems almost inhuman that we should live so close to suffering and poverty ... within a few blocks of our own home and bear no part in this great life&quot; (100 Years, Introduction). This altruistic spirit inspired Harriman Rumsey to organize a group of 80 young women to volunteer for the College Settlement on Rivington Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Every week, League members would teach classes, hand out library books and engage in other enriching activities for children at the settlement house. Eleanor Roosevelt, who joined the Junior League in 1903 and served as League secretary in 1904, also taught dance and calisthenic classes at the Rivington Street Settlement House (100 Years, 21).

The Junior League House for Working Girls (Junior League Hotel) grew out of the organization’s early volunteer work with settlement movements. Dorothy Payne Whitney, president of the New York League from 1907 to 1909, and League members began to engage in conversations around how they might best support working women in the city. There was an interest in creating affordable, sanitary and comfortable accommodations solely for women – an alternative to tenement housing that would also protect against discrimination on the basis of nationality or religion. In 1909, the Junior League erected a six-story building on the corner of 78th street and East End Avenue, which would serve as the Junior League Hotel until its closure in 1931. At a rate of $4 to $7 a week, residents were provided a range of amenities including a library, roof garden, laundry, and tennis and basketball courts. The Junior League Hotel served as a model for Junior Leagues in other cities, many of which sponsored their own residential hotels and services for working women (100 Years, 21).

As Junior Leagues began to crop up in cities across the United States during the 1910s, the organization restated its mission with a focus on bolstering &quot;an interest in all kinds of charitable and social effort&quot; among its members, as well as supporting &quot;already organized philanthropies&quot; (100 Years, 27). This wide-ranging agenda would go on to encompass volunteering efforts around the country related to education, voting rights, child welfare and historic preservation, among other areas.

===Education reform===
Over the early years of the League’s development, education emerged as a central aspect of the organization’s efforts to advance social causes. Through the School and Home Visitors program, the League sponsored teachers to assist with bolstering communication between schools and immigrant parents, and by 1909, the League was supplying schools with visiting teachers and volunteer tutors (100 Years, 23). School and Home Visitors, which began as a pilot project, was ultimately so successful that in 1910, New York state absorbed responsibility for the program and expanded its funding and reach. Nathalie Henderson, a League co-founder and chair of the organization’s Committee on Visiting Teachers of the Public Education Society, went on to chair New York’s joint Committee for Education and serve as a trustee at Teachers College, Columbia University (100 Years, 24).

When a League was organized in Brooklyn in 1910, the members petitioned the Board of Education to provide free lunches in public schools and transform vacant lots into playgrounds (100 Years, 26).

This advocacy work continued after World War II, when the Baby Boom created an additional need for resources to support schools, playgrounds, and teachers. With a shortage of teachers, League members volunteered in diagnostic programs and those for gifted and challenged children. By the mid-1950s, over 100 Leagues established public play areas for children (100 Years, 104).

In the 1980s, the Junior League participated in and led several campaigns for literacy. Along with other national organizations, the League joined in PLUS (Project Literacy US), a coordinated effort to expand literacy as a way of preventing against the spread of homelessness (100 Years, 140). Later that decade, First Ladies of the United States and Junior League members Barbara Bush and Laura Bush founded The Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. The Foundation granted over $6 million to more than 200 Family Literacy Programs across the country in its first decade of operations. Laura Bush spearheaded an initiative in early childhood development to help infants and children get a leg up on reading before entering school (100 Years, 144).

===Suffrage movement===

In 1914, the St. Louis Junior League mobilized to support women’s suffrage. They staged a demonstration – what the St. Louis women referred to as a &quot;walkless, talkless parade&quot; - at the 1916 Democratic National Convention, which ultimately resulted in the Democrats voting to include a plank for women&#x27;s suffrage. The St. Louis League expressed their support in various ways, including reforming the organization as The League of Women Voters, a new group (100 Years, 36).

One year after Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Junior League held its annual conference in St. Louis. With discussions swirling around women’s suffrage at the conference, the League decided to form Legislative committees that would focus on &quot;city or state laws, especially those affecting the social welfare of women and children&quot; (100 Years, 37).

===Child welfare===

Junior Leagues have historically advanced causes related to the well-being of women and children in various ways. Leagues across the country pioneered these efforts. Tucson, Arizona established the city’s first day nursery, and Cincinnati established the Junior League Welfare Station, a clinic created to care for the children of indigent families (100 Years, 50). In 1917, members of the New York League organized the first network of volunteers in an outpatient department in New York City through the Children’s Clinic at Bellevue Hospital (100 Years, 38).

During the Great Depression, Junior Leagues ramped up efforts to care for infants, children and families in need. Junior Leagues established and operated milk stations and nurseries for the children of working women, and also ran soup kitchens (100 Years, 65). The Tampa Junior League supported and built out a tuberculosis clinic and treatment center known as the Pine Health Preventorium, through which it provided assistance to 150 children between 1933 and 1934 (100 Years, 65).

===Childhood immunization===

In the wake of the 1952 polio epidemic, the Junior League played a critical role in promoting the use of the polio vaccine, discovered by Dr. Jonas Salk, and for advocating for the rehabilitation of polio patients. In recognition for its efforts, the League received the March of Dimes Service Award in 1957 (100 Years, 101).

In the 1990s, the Junior League played a pivotal role in advocating for children to have greater access to health care. In 1991, the League launched Don&#x27;t Wait to Vaccinate, a public awareness campaign focused on encouraging early childhood immunization (100 Years, 11). All 276 Leagues joined in to distribute information about the importance of vaccination, utilizing multilingual radio announcements, billboards, and handouts to spread the message. Along with these efforts, the Leagues tackled problem areas such as the lack of health clinics, insurance and language barriers that they recognized as factors in preventing wider-spread immunization (100 Years, 101). To eliminate these barriers, Leagues identified the issues that were most relevant to their own local populations and then deployed educational materials and collaborated with health agencies and other Leagues to create effective children’s health programs (100 Years, 161). The success of the Don&#x27;t Wait campaign garnered widespread attention – President George Bush called the program &quot;a point of light&quot; (100 Years, 166).

===Public policy &amp; advocacy===

Despite the Women’s Suffrage movement fueling the establishment of a number of Junior Leagues, the official stance on engaging in public policy efforts for the Association in the early 20th century was to avoid any partisan issues and stay away from public arena (Volunteering, 97–98). The official position of the Association was to focus League energies towards their purpose of fostering interest among their members in the social, economic, educational, cultural and civic conditions of their own communities and to make efficient their volunteer service (this is quoted in Volunteering, 97 but is cited from AJLA Yearbooks https://archives.lib.umn.edu/repositories/11/archival_objects/490625). The 1930s were rife with disagreements on this issue and eventually a shaky agreement evolved where Leagues could act on public issues locally (Volunteer, 100), however, this would continue to cause debate at League Annual Conferences. Early on Leagues began to form State Public Affairs Committees (SPAC) where Leagues within a state would cooperate on

PACs (Public Affairs Committees), SPACs (State Public Affairs Committees) and LICs (Legislative Issues Committees) are individual, apolitical Junior Leagues or coalitions of Junior Leagues within a state that form to educate and take action on public policy issues relevant to The Junior League Mission. Having begun to take shape in the 1930s, they are collectively governed by their member Leagues and the methods by which they operate vary by state, as do the issues chosen for study and action.

===Children’s theaters and puppetry===

Junior Leagues played an important role in spreading children’s theater across the United States, both as a form of community service for League members and as way of introducing live-performance to children who might not have experienced it otherwise. The Junior League of Chicago was the first to stage children’s theater in 1921, and by 1929, it hosted &quot;America’s first conference on children’s theater&quot; (100 Years, 57). Following the conference, the Junior League of Chicago produced a national tour of The Blue Bird by Maurice Maeterlinck, which was staged in 15 cities and seen by 35,000 children.

While children’s theater started in Chicago, it quickly spread to Leagues across the country. By 1931, children’s plays were staged by 80 Leagues, and almost all of the 148 Leagues put on some form of children’s theater, marionette or puppet shows by 1938. The Junior League of Chicago even had a presence at the Chicago’s World Fair where they presented weekly shows over a four-month run (100 Years, 57).

As children’s theater grew into a national movement, it eventually evolved into other mediums like radio and television as well. The popular children’s television show Kukla, Fran and Ollie originated from puppet shows staged in Chicago by Burr Tillstrom and the Junior League in the 1940s (100 Years, 59). Fred Rogers’ daily television program The Children’s Corner was developed with help from the League, and Margaret Hamilton, who would go on to play the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz, got her start in children’s theater as a member of the Junior League (100 Years, 60).

In addition to providing enriching entertainment, Leagues were also cognizant of the comfort that theater could bring to children during times of uncertainty. From 1944 to 1945, Leagues put on 783 theater performances for nearly 370,000 children. And in the last year of the second World War, Leagues staged 36 live radio programs for children (100 Years, 87).

===Museums===

As was the case of children’s theatre, Junior Leagues were also instrumental in opening children’s museums to help expose children to science and technology, art and nature. By the end of the 1950s, Leagues across the country – from San Francisco to Jacksonville, Florida – established or entered into partnerships to open up museums for children in their own communities (100 Years, 102). The Denver Junior League was the first to open a children’s museum in 1945. Co-sponsored by the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Children’s Museum was such a success that its opening weekend brought in 10,000 visitors. Ultimately the museum served as a pilot project, both for the nation and for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (100 Years, 103).

Many other Leagues followed the example set by the Denver Children’s Museum. In 1950, the Junior League of Miami opened the Junior Museum of Miami, a small house that brought in more 2,000 children in its first three months and eventually evolved into the Miami Museum of Science. League members also mobilized to secure funds and necessary resources for children’s museums. In 1946, the Junior League of Charlotte stepped in to save a small but popular Children’s Nature Museum thought up by a local school teacher from financial ruin. The League staged a fashion show, barbershop quartet, and follies to raise funds, eventually securing enough resources to take over an abandoned day nursery for a nature center. By 1951, the League pitched in to help the museum move into a larger, $68,000 building (100 Years, 103).

In 1959, the Junior League of the Palm Beaches founded and incorporated the South Florida Science Museum, today known as the Cox Science Center and Aquarium. The museum opened in 1961, and in 1964 added a new wing housing the planetarium which was dedicated by and named after astronaut Buzz Aldrin.

In addition to opening new museums, Leagues also worked with existing museums to support children-friendly sections. This was the case for the &quot;Please Touch&quot; Gallery at the Museum of the City of New York, which was staffed by volunteers and financed by the League (100 Years, 103).

Beyond the 1950s, the Leagues continued to meet the needs of communities around the country by opening children’s museums. In 1976, the Junior League of Pittsburgh contributed to the founding of the Pittsburgh Children’s Museum, and in 1982, the Junior League of Chicago organized around fighting cutbacks in funding for the city’s public schools by helping to establish the Chicago Children’s Museum.

In 1961, the Junior League of Chicago co-founded the Art Institute&#x27;s volunteer Docent Program to revitalize and expand &quot;programming for children.&quot;

In 2017, the Association of Children’s Museums granted the 2017 ACM Great Friend to Kids Award to the Junior League in recognition of the organization’s contributions to advocating for children and their education and for their work developing children’s museums.

===World War efforts===

When World War I broke out in Europe in 1914, the Junior League of Montreal was the first to spring into action, initially by raising money for refugees. Almost all Leagues in the U.S. became involved by 1916, despite the nation’s stated neutrality which lasted until April 1917 (timeline). In addition to fundraising efforts, Leagues organized classes, including those focused on home nursing, as well as &quot;preparedness&quot; initiatives that were often organized in coordination with the Red Cross (100 Years, 39).

Perhaps even more so than the first world war, World War II galvanized Junior Leagues into action. In July 1940, as awareness spread that the United States would join the war, the AJLA called a special meeting to mobilize all Leagues in the United States to form central volunteer bureaus. This movement built off of capabilities already developed during the Depression that matched volunteers with agencies in need of help. In August 1941, all Leagues were sent a plan for organizing community volunteer initiatives entitled &quot;A Central Volunteer Bureau in Defense,&quot; a plan for coordinating community volunteer efforts (100 Years, 80).

The Junior League of the Palm Beaches grew out of the World War II effort when 15 women established a Junior Welfare League in 1941, focused on supporting the WWII training bases that had opened in Palm Beach County. The women hosted canteen events for soldiers and worked with the Red Cross.

In the United States and Canada, volunteer efforts for the war took on many different forms. Junior League members organized blood drives, worked for the Red Cross, volunteered in daycare centers, sold US Treasury War Bonds and Stamps, and performed for servicemen at the USO and other venues (100 Years, 86). Overseas, League Members volunteered with various organizations, including an 125-person unit of Junior League Members who served with the YMCA in France (100 Years, 80).

As volunteerism flourished, Junior League members also took on more official responsibilities in war efforts. It was through the work of Oveta Culp Hobby, member of the Houston Junior League and Director of the Women’s Interest Section of the War Department, that the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps (WAAC) was formed in 1941. After President Roosevelt signed the bill establishing the WAAC, Hobby was promoted to Major Hobby. As director, Major Hobby was charged with mobilizing and training women to be soldiers, and, &quot;making available to the national defense the knowledge, skill, and special training of the women of the nation&quot; (100 Years, 84).

The WAACs under Major Hobby’s charge initially took on roles ranging from clerks and secretaries to aircraft warning observers. However, as the war progressed, WAACs assumed a broader range of primarily communication and clerical responsibilities overseas. By 1943, the initiative had garnered such success that the WAAC was elevated to Regular Army and afforded pay and privileges equal to what was granted to male soldiers (100 Years, 85).

===Culinary arts===
Junior League chapters have produced a number of cookbooks. The New York Junior League&#x27;s cookbooks include &quot;New York Entertains&quot; (1974), &quot;I&#x27;ll Taste Manhattan&quot; (1994), and the &quot;120th Anniversary Cookbook&quot; (2021). The Junior League of Augusta&#x27;s cookbooks include the three volume, The Masters golf tournament themed &quot;Tea-Time at the Masters&quot; series: &quot;Tea-Time at the Masters&quot; (1977), &quot;Second Round: Tea-Time at the Masters&quot; (1988), and &quot;Par 3: Tea-Time at the Masters&quot; (2005). Some book collectors have taken to collecting cookbooks from various chapters of the Junior League.

The Masters golf tournament features a concession stand that is well known for certain menu items, including its pimento cheese sandwiches. The &quot;Par 3: Tea-Time at the Masters&quot; includes a recipe for &quot;Four-Cheese Pimento Sandwiches&quot; which is said to resemble the ones served at The Masters.

===Skills development===
Members of The Junior League obtain knowledge, skills, and experiences in areas such as: Leadership, Organizational development, Community needs assessment, Mentoring, Advocacy, Communications, Fund development, Strategic planning, Negotiation, Consensus-building, and Networking.

===Membership===
The Junior League is an all-women organization. In 1996, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and &quot;San Francisco Gate&quot; publicized that a male hairdresser named Clark Clementsen tried to join the League after his &quot;high society clients&quot; recommended him, but was denied membership and retained an attorney to argue his case at a meeting of AJLI representatives in NYC. For him, members had &quot;been trained to be organized, articulate community leaders, and it showed...no men&#x27;s organization even came close.&quot;

===Fundraisers and advocacy===
The Junior League has a full calendar year of members-only, family-friendly, and public events at their clubhouses and local venues such as hotels. Notable JL events raising money for partner community organizations related to foster children, domestic violence, human trafficking, illiteracy, city beautification, and other issues include, but are not limited to:

*Annual Winter Ball—the Junior League&#x27;s largest fundraiser since 1952, where League awards are given to honor outstanding members and a public figure, such as Mary J. Blige (2011). Non-member dinner tickets start at $500+.
*Annual Thanksgiving Eve Ball—introducing debutantes to society at The Plaza and Waldorf-Astoria since 1948
*Savor the Spring Restaurant Week
*Spring House Tour
*Team JL at the New York City Marathon

<doc id="573829" wikidata="Q427302" url="?curid=573829" title="Neal Smith (drummer)">
<text>Neal Smith (born September 23, 1947) is an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock group Alice Cooper from 1967 to 1974. He performed on the group&#x27;s early albums &quot;Pretties for You&quot; and &quot;Easy Action&quot;, their breakout album &quot;Love It to Death&quot; and the subsequent successful albums &quot;Killer&quot;, &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, and &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;. The last new studio album with the five original Alice Cooper group members participating in new music was &quot;Muscle of Love&quot; in 1973. The original group&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; studio album was released in 1974. In 2018 (fifty years after the original group debuted its new group name Alice Cooper in 1968), a live performance album &quot;Live from the Astroturf&quot; recorded in 2015 was released, featuring four of the original group members performing eight of their hit songs, with long-time Alice Cooper solo band guitarist and friend Ryan Roxie interplaying lead guitar parts with original group rhythm guitarist Michael Bruce, on behalf of original group lead guitarist Glen Buxton, who died in 1997 of pneumonia at age 49.

In 2011, Smith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in the &quot;Performer&quot; category, as a member of the original Alice Cooper group.

==Music career==

Smith graduated in 1965 from Camelback High School in Phoenix, while three of his Alice Cooper band members graduated from Cortez High School and one from North High School. Smith talks about his high school in the song &quot;Alma Mater&quot; sung by Alice Cooper. Neal Smith&#x27;s drum part on the title track of &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; is considered one of the most original and dynamic amongst musicians and fans of the group.

Billion Dollar Babies was also the name of the band founded by former Alice Cooper group musicians Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway and Neal Smith along with Bob Dolin and Mike Marconi after they split from Alice Cooper in 1974. This band was embroiled in a legal suit over the usage of the name. They released only one album, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Battle Axe&quot;, before disbanding.

Smith has been selling real estate in New England since the early 1980s. He is also still active in music, and performed with Alice Cooper during a show in 1998. In 1999, he released his first solo album, &quot;Platinum God&quot;, recorded in 1975. He is also currently the drummer/percussionist and songwriter for Bouchard, Dunaway &amp; Smith (BDS), composed of Smith, former Blue Öyster Cult bassist Joe Bouchard, and original Alice Cooper bassist Dennis Dunaway. The band has co-written songs with Ian Hunter. BDS has released two albums: 2001&#x27;s &quot;Back From Hell&quot;, and 2003&#x27;s &quot;BDS Live In Paris&quot;. Smith has also released two albums under the group name Cinematik, with guitarist Robert Mitchell and bassist Peter Catucci, produced by Rob Fraboni. Cinematik has a loose, jam-laden world-beat sound, as opposed to BDS&#x27;s more classic-rock sound.

Smith has also recorded with Buck Dharma of Blue Öyster Cult (&quot;Flat Out&quot;, 1982), Plasmatics (&quot;Beyond the Valley of 1984&quot;, 1981), and Deadringer (&quot;Electrocution of the Heart&quot;, 1989). Neal played on Bruce Cameron&#x27;s CD &quot;Midnight Daydream&quot; along with an all-star cast of Jack Bruce, Buddy Miles, Billy Cox, Mitch Mitchell, Harvy Dalton Arnold and Ken Hensley. Neal Smith also has an industrial rock project called Killsmith. Killsmith&#x27;s sophomore release underway makes Neal Smith set to be the first member of the original Alice Cooper Group to have a project of original material released after the group&#x27;s induction to the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame.

On July 1, 2010 when talking about the album, &quot;Welcome 2 My Nightmare&quot;, Alice Cooper said in a Radio Metal interview: &quot;We’ll put some of the original people on it and add some new people, I’m very happy with working with Bob (Ezrin) again.&quot; Musicians who appeared on the album included Rob Zombie, Vince Gill, Steven Hunter and Dick Wagner. Smith, Dennis Dunaway and Michael Bruce played on 3 songs on the album, and Smith co-wrote the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Bite Your Face Off&quot;.

In 2015, Smith played drums on the Hollywood Vampires cover of &quot;School&#x27;s Out / Another Brick in the Wall part 2&quot; on the album &quot;Hollywood Vampires&quot;.

He featured on two tracks on Cooper&#x27;s 2021 album Detroit Stories.

<text>PC-File was a flat-file database computer application most often run under MS-DOS. 

==Software==
It was one of the first of three widely popular software products sold via the marketing method that became known as shareware. It was originally written by Jim &quot;Button&quot; Knopf in late 1982, and he formed the company Buttonware to develop, market, and support it.

The program was usually distributed for the cost of diskettes by local user groups. There was no copy protection and a manual was distributed as a file on the same diskettes as the program. It was extremely simple to use and extremely stable. It ran on just about any PC, while competing commercial products costing hundreds of dollars were often picky and full of bugs.

Knopf originally wrote the software for his own use to manage a church mailing list, on an Apple II. Later, he ported it to CP/M, and then to MS-DOS. Other people heard about it, and started requesting copies. Eventually, the cost of sending out update disks inspired Knopf to include a note requesting a small cash donation to offset the expenses. The response was overwhelming, and when his income from PC-File exceeded &quot;ten times&quot; what he was making from his job at IBM, he decided to turn Buttonware into a full-time business.

After PC-File version 3.0, Buttonware released PC-File/R, which had limited &quot;relational&quot; capabilities. In 1987, PC-File+ was rewritten to use the popular dBASE III file format.

PC-File for Microsoft Windows v8 was published by Outlook Software / Ace Software (previously Good Software) in 1994. This version works on Windows 3.1, 95, 98, and XP, but uses the 8.3 file naming convention. PC File will not run on Windows 7 64 bit, even in the XP compatibility mode, but will run in &#x27;XP Mode&#x27;.

==Reception==
In a 1984 review of databases, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; found that &quot;quite a few ... rough edges&quot; existed, but concluded that &quot;on a performance/price basis, [PC-File III] may be the best money you&#x27;ll ever spend&quot;.

<text>PC-Write was a computer word processor and was one of the first three widely popular software products sold via the marketing method that became known as shareware. It was originally written by Bob Wallace in early 1983.

==Overview==
PC-Write was a modeless editor, using control characters and special function keys to perform various editing operations. By default it accepted many of the same control key commands as WordStar while adding many of its own features. It could produce plain ASCII text files, but there were also features that embedded control characters in a document to support automatic section renumbering, bold and italic fonts, and other such; also, a feature that was useful in list processing (as used in Auto LISP) was its ability to find matching open and closed parenthesis &quot;( )&quot;; this matching operation also worked for the other paired characters: { }, [ ] and &lt; &gt;.

Lines beginning with particular control characters n

and/or a period (.) contained commands that were evaluated when the document was printed, e.g. to specify margin sizes, select elite or pica type, or to specify the number of lines of text that would fit on a page, such as in escape sequences.

While Quicksoft distributed copies of PC-Write for $10, the company encouraged users to make copies of the program for others in an early example of shareware. Quicksoft asked those who liked PC-Write to send it $75. The sum provided a printed manual (notable for its many pictures of cats, drawn by Megan Dana-Wallace), telephone technical support, source code, and a registration number that the user entered into his copy of the program. If anyone else paid the company $75 to purchase an already-registered copy of the software, the company paid a $25 commission back to the original registrant, and then issued a new number to the new buyer, thereby giving a financial incentive for buyers to distribute and promote the software. 

A configuration file allowed customizing PC-Write, including remapping the keyboard. Later versions of the registered (paid for) version of the program included a thesaurus (which was not shareware) along with the editor. In addition, there was vocabulary available in other languages, such as in German. Utilities were also provided to convert PC-Write files to and from other file formats that were common at the time. One limitation of the software was its inability to print directly from memory - because the print function was a separate subprogram, a document must be saved to a file before it could be printed.

Bob Wallace found that running Quicksoft used so much of his time he could not improve the PC-Write software. In early 1991, he sold the firm to another Microsoft alumnus, Leo Nikora, the original product manager for Windows 1.0 (1983–1985). Wallace returned to full programming and an updated version of PC-Write was released in June 1991.

One unusual feature of PC-Write was its implementation of free form editing: it could copy and paste a block of text anywhere. For instance, if one had a block of information, one per line, in the format Name (spaces) Address, one could highlight only the addresses section and paste that into the right-hand part of a page. Today, Emacs and jEdit are also capable of performing this function.

When the market changed to multi-program software (office suites combining word processing, spreadsheet, and database programs), Quicksoft went out of business in 1993.

The first Trojan horse (appearing in 1986), PC-Write Trojan, masqueraded as &quot;version 2.72&quot; of the shareware word processor PC-Write. Quicksoft did not release a version 2.72.

PC-Write had one of the first &quot;as you type&quot;, in &quot;real-time mode&quot; spell checker; earlier spell checkers only worked in &quot;batch mode&quot;.

The Brown Bag Word Processor
is based on 
PC-Write&#x27;s source code,
licensed by Brown Bag Software,
with some minor modifications and additions.

==Reception==
&quot;PC Magazine&quot; stated that version 1.3 of &quot;&quot;PC-Write&quot; rates extremely well and compares favorably with many word processors costing much more&quot;. It cited very fast performance, good use of color, and availability of source code as advantages, while lack of built-in support for printing bold or underline and keyboard macros was a disadvantage. &quot;Compute!&quot; complimented the software&#x27;s &quot;clean implementation of standard editing features&quot;, cited its &quot;truly staggering&quot; level of customization, and after mentioning a few flaws stated that they should be &quot;viewed in context of the program&#x27;s overall excellence&quot;.

<text>PC-Talk is a communications software program. It was one of the first three widely popular software products sold via the marketing method that became known as shareware. It was written by Andrew Fluegelman in late 1982, and helped created shareware&#x27;s sales and marketing methodology.

Fluegelman distributed PC-Talk by sending a copy to anyone who sent him a formatted floppy disk. The application encouraged users who liked it to send him $25, but doing so was not obligatory. Fluegelman also encouraged users to make copies for friends, and provided a batch file to do so. Though PC-Talk is regarded as a progenitor of the shareware distribution model, it was labeled at the time both freeware and &quot;user-supported software&quot;, and included elements of open-source software (but not free software).

PC-Talk III was sold for $35 instead of being distributed for free; The Headlands Press offered a $25 discount to those who had previously donated. Its source code was available and many derivative works were created by its user community. The CompuServe IBM/PC SIG forum developed &quot;PC-TALK III Version B, Level 850311&quot;. Both the user-modified version of the program and the CompuServe distribution point were officially sanctioned by Fluegelman and The Headlands Press, holders of the copyright for PC-TALK. Members of HAL-PC also produced custom versions that supported videotex and IBM 3101 emulation.

==Reception==
&quot;PC Magazine&quot; said that PC-Talk &quot;is elegantly written and performs beautifully. It is easy to use and has all the features I would expect from a communications program&quot;.

<text>Aeromancy (from Greek ἀήρ &quot;aḗr&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, and &quot;manteia&quot;, &quot;divination&quot;) is divination that is conducted by interpreting atmospheric conditions. Alternate terms include &quot;arologie&quot;, &quot;aeriology&quot;, and &quot;aërology&quot;.

==Practice==
Aeromancy uses cloud formations, wind currents, and cosmological events such as comets, to attempt to divine the past, present, or future. There are sub-types of this practice which are as follows: austromancy (wind divination), ceraunoscopy (observing thunder and lightning), chaomancy (aerial vision), meteormancy (meteors, AKA shooting stars), and nephomancy (cloud divination).

==History==
Variations on the concept have been used throughout history, the practice is thought to have been used by the ancient Babylonian priests, and is probably alluded to in the bible.

Damascius, the last of the Neoplatonists, records an account of nephomancy in the 5th century CE, during the reign of Leo I:

==Cultural influence==
The ancient Etruscans produced guides to brontoscopic and fulgural divination of the future, based upon the omens that were supposedly displayed by thunder or lightning that occurred on particular days of the year, or in particular places.

Divination by clouds was condemned by Moses in Deuteronomy 18:10 and 18:14 in the Hebrew Bible. In contrast, english christian bibles typically translate the same hebrew words into &quot;soothsayers&quot; and &quot;conjurers&quot; or the like.

In Renaissance magic, aeromancy was classified as one of the seven &quot;forbidden arts&quot;, along with necromancy, geomancy, hydromancy, pyromancy, chiromancy (palmistry), and spatulamancy (scapulimancy). It was thus condemned by Albertus Magnus in &quot;Speculum Astronomiae&quot; as a derivative of necromancy. The practice was further debunked by Luis de Valladolid in his 1889 work &quot;Historia de vita et doctrina Alberti Magni&quot;.

<text>Karl Manne Georg Siegbahn (; 3 December 1886 – 26 September 1978) was a Swedish physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1924 &quot;for his discoveries and research in the field of X-ray spectroscopy&quot;.

==Biography==
Siegbahn was born in Örebro, Sweden, the son of Georg Siegbahn and his wife, Emma Zetterberg.

He graduated in Stockholm 1906 and began his studies at Lund University in the same year. During his education he was secretarial assistant to Johannes Rydberg. In 1908 he studied at the University of Göttingen. He obtained his doctorate (PhD) at the Lund University in 1911, his thesis was titled &quot;Magnetische Feldmessungen&quot; (magnetic field measurements). He became acting professor for Rydberg when his (Rydberg&#x27;s) health was failing, and succeeded him as full professor in 1920. However, in 1922 he left Lund for a professorship at Uppsala University.

In 1937, Siegbahn was appointed Director of the Physics Department of the Nobel Institute of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1988 this was renamed the Manne Siegbahn Institute (MSI). The institute research groups have been reorganized since, but the name lives on in the Manne Siegbahn Laboratory hosted by Stockholm University.

== X-ray spectroscopy ==
Manne Siegbahn began his studies of X-ray spectroscopy in 1914. Initially he used the same type of spectrometer as Henry Moseley had done for finding the relationship between the wavelength of some elements and their place at the periodic system. Shortly thereafter he developed improved experimental apparatus which allowed him to make very accurate measurements of the X-ray wavelengths produced by atoms of different elements. Also, he found that several of the spectral lines that Moseley had discovered consisted of more components. By studying these components and improving the spectrometer, Siegbahn got an almost complete understanding of the electron shell. He developed a convention for naming the different spectral lines that are characteristic to elements in X-ray spectroscopy, the Siegbahn notation. Siegbahn&#x27;s precision measurements drove many developments in quantum theory and atomic physics.

==Awards and honours==
Siegbahn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1924. He won the Hughes Medal 1934 and Rumford Medal 1940. In 1944, he patented the Siegbahn pump. Siegbahn was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1954.

There is a street, Route Siegbahn, named after Siegbahn at CERN, on the Prévessin site in France.

==Personal life==
Siegbahn married Karin Högbom in 1914. They had two children: Bo Siegbahn (1915–2008), a diplomat and politician, and Kai Siegbahn (1918–2007), a physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1981 for his contribution to the development of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

==Awards and decorations==
* Commander Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star (6 June 1947)
* Nobel Prize in Physics (1924)
* Hughes Medal (1934)
* Rumford Medal (1940)

<doc id="573850" wikidata="Q815203" url="?curid=573850" title="Siege of Rouen (1418–1419)">
<text>The siege of Rouen (29 July 1418 – 19 January 1419) was a major event in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, in which English forces loyal to Henry V captured Rouen, the capital of Normandy, from the Norman French.

==Background==
At the time of the siege, the city had a population of 20,000, making it one of the leading cities in France, and its capture was crucial to the Normandy campaign. From about 1415, Rouen had been strengthened and reinforced by the French and was the most formidably defended place that the English had yet faced. The previous year, Henry V had successfully taken another important city in Normandy following the siege of Caen.

==Prelude==
When the English reached Rouen, the walls were defended by 60 towers, each containing three cannons, and six gates protected by barbicans. The garrison of Rouen had been reinforced by 4,000 men and there were some 16,000 civilians willing to endure a siege. The defences were lined by an army of crossbow men under the command of Alain Blanchard, commander of the crossbows (&quot;arbalétriers&quot;), and second in command to Guy le Bouteiller, a Burgundian captain and the overall commander.

==Siege==
To besiege the city, Henry set up four fortified camps and barricaded the River Seine with iron chains, completely surrounding the city, with the English intending to starve out the defenders. The Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless, had just captured Paris from the Armagnacs. He did not make an attempt to save Rouen and advised citizens to look after themselves. By December, the inhabitants were eating cats, dogs, horses, and even mice and the streets were filled with starving citizens. The city expelled more than 12,000 of the poor to save food, but Henry would not allow them to pass through the siege line, and they were forced to live without sustenance in the defensive ditch in front of the city wall. Even the English felt sorry for the starving people. On Christmas Day 1418, King Henry allowed two priests to give them food, but the day soon ended, and the people went back to dying miserably in the ditch.

Despite several sorties by the French garrison, this state of affairs continued. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Boutellier asked for negotiations. Following ten days of negotiation, the defenders decided they would surrender on 19 January 1419 if no help had arrived, on the agreed terms that the surviving French would be allowed to keep their homes and property if they gave up 80 hostages, paid 300,000 gold crowns, and swore allegiance to the English. Blanchard, who had summarily hung English prisoners of war from the city walls, was one of three French notables beheaded by the English when Rouen fell.

==Aftermath==
Henry went on to take all of Normandy apart from Mont-Saint-Michel, which withstood a blockade. Rouen became the main English base in northern France, allowing Henry to launch campaigns on Paris and to the south.

<doc id="573861" wikidata="Q1630663" url="?curid=573861" title="HotBot">
<text>HotBot is a Canadian web search engine owned by HotBot Limited, whose key principal is Kristen Richardson. The search engine was initially launched in North America in 1996 by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. During the 1990s, it was one of the most popular search engines on the World Wide Web. The domain was sold in 2016 and was used for other unrelated purposes for several years. Hotbot search engine was relaunched in 2022 under new ownership and with a different technology.

==History==

HotBot was launched in May 1996 by &quot;Wired&quot; online division HotWired, as a tool providing search results served by the Inktomi database. The search engine was co-developed by Inktomi, a four-month-old start-up staffed by University of California, Berkeley students. HotBot was launched using a &quot;new links&quot; strategy of marketing, claiming to index the entire web weekly, more often than competitors like AltaVista, and its website stated it being the &quot;most complete Web index online&quot; with 54 million documents. Its colorful interface and impressive features (e.g. being able to search with any entered words, or an entire phrase) drew acclaim and popularity.

Directory results were provided originally by LookSmart and then DMOZ from mid-1999. HotBot also used search data from Direct Hit Technologies for a period starting February 1999, which was a tool that used click-through data to manipulate results. Inktomi&#x27;s Smart Crawl technology, allowing 10 million webpages to be crawled weekly, was incorporated into HotBot in March 1997. HotBot was the 19th most visited website based on web traffic as of 1998.

Lycos acquired HotBot as part of its acquisition of &quot;Wired&quot; in October 1998 and it was run separately, alongside Lycos&#x27;s already existing search engine. Hereafter, HotBot languished with limited development and falling market share. A HotBot NeoPlanet browser was also released which integrated HotBot and other Wired and Lycos links. At the end of 2002, HotBot was relaunched as a multiple option search tool, giving users the option to search either the FAST, Google, Inktomi or Teoma databases.

In March 2004, Lycos launched a beta release of a free toolbar search product, Lycos HotBot DeskTop, which the company said was &quot;the first product to integrate traditional desktop search with Web search within the browser.&quot; The HotBot DeskTop could search the Internet using Inktomi, e-mail folders for Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express, and user documents stored on a hard drive. It also incorporated a blocker for pop-up ads and an RSS News Reader syndication. Indexes created to track e-mail and user files remained stored locally to protect user privacy. Text-based ads were displayed when viewing results for several types of Internet searches. Lycos licensed dtSearch technology to power the local search options.

In July 2011, HotBot was relaunched with a new robot-like mascot, a new logo, and a modern site design. In the beta, HotBot became a portal, returning not just web search results, but also searches from various Lycos websites, such as News, Shopping and Weather Zombie. The portal interface lasted for roughly six months, and these features were instead reincorporated into the 2012 Lycos website redesign, returning HotBot to a simplified search interface.

== Sale of domain name ==
In October 2016, Lycos sold the Hotbot.com domain name for $155,000 to an unnamed buyer. Afterwards, the HotBot domain became home to an unrelated shopping search site, ending the 20-year history of the original site.

In April 2018, the domain was put under new ownership and became an unrelated privacy-focused search engine.

As of 2020, the HotBot domain is controlled by a VPN company based in Seychelles.

In 2023 the aforementioned VPN company pivoted to offering an AI based web-search feature, inspired by however not officially affiliated with the domain&#x27;s original usage in 1996.

<text>Angels Fall First is the debut studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, originally released by Spinefarm Records on 30 September 1997 as a 500-copy limited edition. This edition is highly sought after by collectors and in 2012 a copy was sold for $1137.23 on eBay. It was subsequently released to the general public on 1 November, with four additional songs. The album was released in the US by Century Media in March 2001.

&quot;Angels Fall First&quot; is a power metal album with gothic, folk and classical elements.

==Background==
Tuomas Holopainen wrote the music for the album during his time in the Finnish Army. In a 2008 interview with the British magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Tuomas Holopainen remembered: 
The original pressing featured Holopainen&#x27;s home contact address, an accident from reprinting the demo sleeve for the album.

As of December 2009, &quot;Angels Fall First&quot; has sold more than 36,000 copies in Finland alone.

The band, and especially band leader and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen has since frowned upon the album, considering it essentially an extended demo. In a 2011 interview, when asked what album other than &quot;Imaginaerum&quot; Holopainen wanted to make into a movie, he replied that it would be &quot;Angels Fall First&quot;, and that it would be &quot;a black-and-white comedy&quot;.

The male vocals heard on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Carpenter&quot;, &quot;Astral Romance&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Troubadour&quot; are sung by keyboardist–band leader Tuomas Holopainen, as well as the whispers in the beginning of the demo version of &quot;Etiäinen&quot;. Following this release, Holopainen never sang credited on an album again, because he thought that he was not good enough.

<doc id="573870" wikidata="Q333655" url="?curid=573870" title="Oceanborn">
<text>Oceanborn is the second studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. It was released in Finland by Spinefarm Records on 7 December 1998 and in the spring of 1999 worldwide. It was released by Drakkar Entertainment in the rest of Europe, and by Toy&#x27;s Factory in Japan. It is their first album with bassist Sami Vänskä.

&quot;Oceanborn&quot; has sold more than 68,000 copies in Finland. The single &quot;Sleeping Sun&quot; was released in August 1999, and the song has been included in every reissue of the album since then. The album was released in the US by Century Media in March 2001.

In 2017, &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked it as the 10th best power metal album of all time.

==Background==
Speaking to &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 2008, band founder Tuomas Holopainen reminisced that the band got really ambitious after the debut album &quot;that was never meant to be released as a proper record. It happened almost by accident, so we decided to put everything into making &quot;Oceanborn&quot; great.&quot; He added:

According to &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;for all its Royal Albert Hall grandiosity, &quot;Oceanborn&quot; was actually recorded in a Finnish school.&quot;

==Style==
This album marked a definitive change in musical scope for Nightwish from their folk-laden roots in &quot;Angels Fall First&quot;, showcasing a more bombastic, power metal-oriented sound with faster tempos, harmonic guitar/keyboard leads, and plenty of double-bass-heavy drumwork. During that time, Stratovarius was Holopainen&#x27;s biggest inspiration, hence the power metal sound of the album. &quot;Oceanborn&quot;&#x27;s sound hearkens a more dramatic approach in the overall musical scope, mostly relegated to the symphonic keyboard work and lead singer Tarja Turunen&#x27;s vocals. According to Mape Ollila, who penned the band&#x27;s biography:
Along with Therion&#x27;s &quot;Theli&quot;, the album came to be known as one of the cornerstones of the emerging genre of symphonic metal.
Most of the lyrics are fantasy-themed, with tracks like &quot;Swanheart&quot; and &quot;Walking in the Air&quot;, a cover from the animated TV special &quot;The Snowman&quot;, as typical examples; however, the song &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, has a more religious feel to it. In addition, there are also some theatrical tracks like &quot;Devil &amp; the Deep Dark Ocean&quot;. &quot;Oceanborn&quot; is among their darkest albums, making use of the harsh vocals of Tapio Wilska in the songs &quot;The Pharaoh Sails to Orion&quot; and &quot;Devil &amp; the Deep Dark Ocean&quot;.

He spent time working in British Columbia and Korea, and in 1994 returned to Canada to assist Chris Hodgson to seek election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for Haliburton—Victoria—Brock. After this, he served as Hodgson&#x27;s chief of staff. Devolin did not seek the nomination in Haliburton—Victoria—Brock in the 1997 and 2000 federal elections.

Over the years, Devolin held several senior political staff positions in the Canadian and Ontario governments, including chief of staff to Ontario Ministers Tim Hudak (1999–2000) and Chris Hodgson (1995–96), special assistant for education to Ontario Premier Mike Harris (1998–99), and director of research and question period strategist for the Reform Party of Canada under Preston Manning (1993–94). From 2000 to 2004, Devolin ran Shuter Street Associates, a strategic communications and planning consulting firm in Toronto.

<text>In quantum physics, a measurement is the testing or manipulation of a physical system to yield a numerical result. A fundamental feature of quantum theory is that the predictions it makes are probabilistic. The procedure for finding a probability involves combining a quantum state, which mathematically describes a quantum system, with a mathematical representation of the measurement to be performed on that system. The formula for this calculation is known as the Born rule. For example, a quantum particle like an electron can be described by a quantum state that associates to each point in space a complex number called a probability amplitude. Applying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives the probabilities that the electron will be found in one region or another when an experiment is performed to locate it. This is the best the theory can do; it cannot say for certain where the electron will be found. The same quantum state can also be used to make a prediction of how the electron will be &quot;moving,&quot; if an experiment is performed to measure its momentum instead of its position. The uncertainty principle implies that, whatever the quantum state, the range of predictions for the electron&#x27;s position and the range of predictions for its momentum cannot both be narrow. Some quantum states imply a near-certain prediction of the result of a position measurement, but the result of a momentum measurement will be highly unpredictable, and vice versa. Furthermore, the fact that nature violates the statistical conditions known as Bell inequalities indicates that the unpredictability of quantum measurement results cannot be explained away as due to ignorance about &quot;local hidden variables&quot; within quantum systems.

Measuring a quantum system generally changes the quantum state that describes that system. This is a central feature of quantum mechanics, one that is both mathematically intricate and conceptually subtle. The mathematical tools for making predictions about what measurement outcomes may occur, and how quantum states can change, were developed during the 20th century and make use of linear algebra and functional analysis. Quantum physics has proven to be an empirical success and to have wide-ranging applicability. However, on a more philosophical level, debates continue about the meaning of the measurement concept.

==Mathematical formalism==
===&quot;Observables&quot; as self-adjoint operators===

In quantum mechanics, each physical system is associated with a Hilbert space, each element of which represents a possible state of the physical system. The approach codified by John von Neumann represents a measurement upon a physical system by a self-adjoint operator on that Hilbert space termed an &quot;observable&quot;. These observables play the role of measurable quantities familiar from classical physics: position, momentum, energy, angular momentum and so on. The dimension of the Hilbert space may be infinite, as it is for the space of square-integrable functions on a line, which is used to define the quantum physics of a continuous degree of freedom. Alternatively, the Hilbert space may be finite-dimensional, as occurs for spin degrees of freedom. Many treatments of the theory focus on the finite-dimensional case, as the mathematics involved is somewhat less demanding. Indeed, introductory physics texts on quantum mechanics often gloss over mathematical technicalities that arise for continuous-valued observables and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, such as the distinction between bounded and unbounded operators; questions of convergence (whether the limit of a sequence of Hilbert-space elements also belongs to the Hilbert space), exotic possibilities for sets of eigenvalues, like Cantor sets; and so forth. These issues can be satisfactorily resolved using spectral theory; the present article will avoid them whenever possible.

===Projective measurement===

The eigenvectors of a von Neumann observable form an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space, and each possible outcome of that measurement corresponds to one of the vectors comprising the basis. A density operator is a positive-semidefinite operator on the Hilbert space whose trace is equal to 1. For each measurement that can be defined, the probability distribution over the outcomes of that measurement can be computed from the density operator. The procedure for doing so is the Born rule, which states that
:formula_1
where formula_2 is the density operator, and formula_3 is the projection operator onto the basis vector corresponding to the measurement outcome formula_4. The average of the eigenvalues of a von Neumann observable, weighted by the Born rule probabilities, is the expectation value of that observable. For an observable formula_5, the expectation value given a quantum state formula_2 is
:formula_7

A density operator that is a rank-1 projection is known as a &quot;pure&quot; quantum state, and all quantum states that are not pure are designated &quot;mixed&quot;. Pure states are also known as &quot;wavefunctions&quot;. Assigning a pure state to a quantum system implies certainty about the outcome of some measurement on that system (i.e., formula_8 for some outcome formula_9). Any mixed state can be written as a convex combination of pure states, though not in a unique way. The state space of a quantum system is the set of all states, pure and mixed, that can be assigned to it.

The Born rule associates a probability with each unit vector in the Hilbert space, in such a way that these probabilities sum to 1 for any set of unit vectors comprising an orthonormal basis. Moreover, the probability associated with a unit vector is a function of the density operator and the unit vector, and not of additional information like a choice of basis for that vector to be embedded in. Gleason&#x27;s theorem establishes the converse: all assignments of probabilities to unit vectors (or, equivalently, to the operators that project onto them) that satisfy these conditions take the form of applying the Born rule to some density operator.

===Generalized measurement (POVM)===

In functional analysis and quantum measurement theory, a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) is a measure whose values are positive semi-definite operators on a Hilbert space. POVMs are a generalisation of projection-valued measures (PVMs) and, correspondingly, quantum measurements described by POVMs are a generalisation of quantum measurement described by PVMs. In rough analogy, a POVM is to a PVM what a mixed state is to a pure state. Mixed states are needed to specify the state of a subsystem of a larger system (see Schrödinger–HJW theorem); analogously, POVMs are necessary to describe the effect on a subsystem of a projective measurement performed on a larger system. POVMs are the most general kind of measurement in quantum mechanics, and can also be used in quantum field theory. They are extensively used in the field of quantum information.

In the simplest case, of a POVM with a finite number of elements acting on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, a POVM is a set of positive semi-definite matrices formula_10 on a Hilbert space formula_11 that sum to the identity matrix,

:formula_12

In quantum mechanics, the POVM element formula_13 is associated with the measurement outcome formula_14, such that the probability of obtaining it when making a measurement on the quantum state formula_2 is given by

:formula_16,

where formula_17 is the trace operator. When the quantum state being measured is a pure state formula_18 this formula reduces to

:formula_19.

===State change due to measurement===

A measurement upon a quantum system will generally bring about a change of the quantum state of that system. Writing a POVM does not provide the complete information necessary to describe this state-change process. To remedy this, further information is specified by decomposing each POVM element into a product:
:formula_20
The Kraus operators formula_21, named for Karl Kraus, provide a specification of the state-change process. They are not necessarily self-adjoint, but the products formula_22 are. If upon performing the measurement the outcome formula_23 is obtained, then the initial state formula_2 is updated to
:formula_25
An important special case is the Lüders rule, named for Gerhart Lüders. If the POVM is itself a PVM, then the Kraus operators can be taken to be the projectors onto the eigenspaces of the von Neumann observable:
:formula_26
If the initial state formula_2 is pure, and the projectors formula_3 have rank 1, they can be written as projectors onto the vectors formula_18 and formula_30, respectively. The formula simplifies thus to
:formula_31
Lüders rule has historically been known as the &quot;reduction of the wave packet&quot; or the &quot;collapse of the wavefunction&quot;. The pure state formula_30 implies a probability-one prediction for any von Neumann observable that has formula_30 as an eigenvector. Introductory texts on quantum theory often express this by saying that if a quantum measurement is repeated in quick succession, the same outcome will occur both times. This is an oversimplification, since the physical implementation of a quantum measurement may involve a process like the absorption of a photon; after the measurement, the photon does not exist to be measured again.

We can define a linear, trace-preserving, completely positive map, by summing over all the possible post-measurement states of a POVM without the normalisation:
:formula_34
It is an example of a quantum channel, and can be interpreted as expressing how a quantum state changes if a measurement is performed but the result of that measurement is lost.

===Examples===

The prototypical example of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space is a qubit, a quantum system whose Hilbert space is 2-dimensional. A pure state for a qubit can be written as a linear combination of two orthogonal basis states formula_35 and formula_36 with complex coefficients:
: formula_37
A measurement in the formula_38 basis will yield outcome formula_35 with probability formula_40 and outcome formula_36 with probability formula_42, so by normalization,
: formula_43

An arbitrary state for a qubit can be written as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, which provide a basis for formula_44 self-adjoint matrices:

:formula_45
where the real numbers formula_46 are the coordinates of a point within the unit ball and
:formula_47
POVM elements can be represented likewise, though the trace of a POVM element is not fixed to equal 1. The Pauli matrices are traceless and orthogonal to one another with respect to the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product, and so the coordinates formula_46 of the state formula_2 are the expectation values of the three von Neumann measurements defined by the Pauli matrices. If such a measurement is applied to a qubit, then by the Lüders rule, the state will update to the eigenvector of that Pauli matrix corresponding to the measurement outcome. The eigenvectors of formula_50 are the basis states formula_51 and formula_52, and a measurement of formula_50 is often called a measurement in the &quot;computational basis.&quot; After a measurement in the computational basis, the outcome of a formula_54 or formula_55 measurement is maximally uncertain.

A pair of qubits together form a system whose Hilbert space is 4-dimensional. One significant von Neumann measurement on this system is that defined by the Bell basis, a set of four maximally entangled states:
:formula_56

A common and useful example of quantum mechanics applied to a continuous degree of freedom is the quantum harmonic oscillator. This system is defined by the Hamiltonian
:formula_57
expresses the probability that one state will pass a test for identifying a successful preparation of the other. The trace distance provides bounds on the fidelity via the Fuchs–van de Graaf inequalities:
:formula_58

===Quantum circuits===

Quantum circuits are a model for quantum computation in which a computation is a sequence of quantum gates followed by measurements. The gates are reversible transformations on a quantum mechanical analog of an &quot;n&quot;-bit register. This analogous structure is referred to as an &quot;n&quot;-qubit register. Measurements, drawn on a circuit diagram as stylized pointer dials, indicate where and how a result is obtained from the quantum computer after the steps of the computation are executed. Without loss of generality, one can work with the standard circuit model, in which the set of gates are single-qubit unitary transformations and controlled NOT gates on pairs of qubits, and all measurements are in the computational basis.

===Measurement-based quantum computation===

Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a model of quantum computing in which the answer to a question is, informally speaking, created in the act of measuring the physical system that serves as the computer.

===Quantum tomography===

Quantum state tomography is a process by which, given a set of data representing the results of quantum measurements, a quantum state consistent with those measurement results is computed. It is named by analogy with tomography, the reconstruction of three-dimensional images from slices taken through them, as in a CT scan. Tomography of quantum states can be extended to tomography of quantum channels and even of measurements.

===Quantum metrology===

Quantum metrology is the use of quantum physics to aid the measurement of quantities that, generally, had meaning in classical physics, such as exploiting quantum effects to increase the precision with which a length can be measured. A celebrated example is the introduction of squeezed light into the LIGO experiment, which increased its sensitivity to gravitational waves.

==Laboratory implementations==
The range of physical procedures to which the mathematics of quantum measurement can be applied is very broad. In the early years of the subject, laboratory procedures involved the recording of spectral lines, the darkening of photographic film, the observation of scintillations, finding tracks in cloud chambers, and hearing clicks from Geiger counters. Language from this era persists, such as the description of measurement outcomes in the abstract as &quot;detector clicks&quot;.

The double-slit experiment is a prototypical illustration of quantum interference, typically described using electrons or photons. The first interference experiment to be carried out in a regime where both wave-like and particle-like aspects of photon behavior are significant was G. I. Taylor&#x27;s test in 1909. Taylor used screens of smoked glass to attenuate the light passing through his apparatus, to the extent that, in modern language, only one photon would be illuminating the interferometer slits at a time. He recorded the interference patterns on photographic plates; for the dimmest light, the exposure time required was roughly three months. In 1974, the Italian physicists Pier Giorgio Merli, Gian Franco Missiroli, and Giulio Pozzi implemented the double-slit experiment using single electrons and a television tube. A quarter-century later, a team at the University of Vienna performed an interference experiment with buckyballs, in which the buckyballs that passed through the interferometer were ionized by a laser, and the ions then induced the emission of electrons, emissions which were in turn amplified and detected by an electron multiplier.

Modern quantum optics experiments can employ single-photon detectors. For example, in the &quot;BIG Bell test&quot; of 2018, several of the laboratory setups used single-photon avalanche diodes. Another laboratory setup used superconducting qubits. The standard method for performing measurements upon superconducting qubits is to couple a qubit with a resonator in such a way that the characteristic frequency of the resonator shifts according to the state for the qubit, and detecting this shift by observing how the resonator reacts to a probe signal.

==Interpretations of quantum mechanics==

Despite the consensus among scientists that quantum physics is in practice a successful theory, disagreements persist on a more philosophical level. Many debates in the area known as quantum foundations concern the role of measurement in quantum mechanics. Recurring questions include which interpretation of probability theory is best suited for the probabilities calculated from the Born rule; and whether the apparent randomness of quantum measurement outcomes is fundamental, or a consequence of a deeper deterministic process. Worldviews that present answers to questions like these are known as &quot;interpretations&quot; of quantum mechanics; as the physicist N. David Mermin once quipped, &quot;New interpretations appear every year. None ever disappear.&quot;

A central concern within quantum foundations is the &quot;quantum measurement problem,&quot; though how this problem is delimited, and whether it should be counted as one question or multiple separate issues, are contested topics. Of primary interest is the seeming disparity between apparently distinct types of time evolution. Von Neumann declared that quantum mechanics contains &quot;two fundamentally different types&quot; of quantum-state change. First, there are those changes involving a measurement process, and second, there is unitary time evolution in the absence of measurement. The former is stochastic and discontinuous, writes von Neumann, and the latter deterministic and continuous. This dichotomy has set the tone for much later debate. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics find the reliance upon two different types of time evolution distasteful and regard the ambiguity of when to invoke one or the other as a deficiency of the way quantum theory was historically presented. To bolster these interpretations, their proponents have worked to derive ways of regarding &quot;measurement&quot; as a secondary concept and deducing the seemingly stochastic effect of measurement processes as approximations to more fundamental deterministic dynamics. However, consensus has not been achieved among proponents of the correct way to implement this program, and in particular how to justify the use of the Born rule to calculate probabilities. Other interpretations regard quantum states as statistical information about quantum systems, thus asserting that abrupt and discontinuous changes of quantum states are not problematic, simply reflecting updates of the available information. Of this line of thought, Bell asked, &quot;&quot;Whose&quot; information? Information about &quot;what&quot;?&quot; Answers to these questions vary among proponents of the informationally-oriented interpretations.

<doc id="573876" wikidata="Q473274" url="?curid=573876" title="Wishmaster (album)">
<text>Wishmaster is the third studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. It was released on 8 May 2000 through Spinefarm Records in Finland. The album was released in the rest of Europe by Drakkar Entertainment on 29 May, and in Japan by Toy&#x27;s Factory on 19 July. In the US, it was released by Century Media on 6 February 2001.

&quot;Wishmaster&quot; peaked at No. 1 in the official Finnish charts; the album also debuted in the European charts at No. 21 in Germany and No. 66 in France. &quot;Wishmaster&quot; has sold more than 79,447 copies in Finland alone, and as of January 2023, more than 150,000 copies have been sold in Germany alone, certifying the album Gold. In 2019, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; ranked it as the 18th best power metal album of all time.

Most reissues of the album contain the song &quot;Sleepwalker&quot;, which was released in July 2000 to compete in the Finnish national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2000.

==Background and release==
The writing and recording of &quot;Wishmaster&quot; was very fast and devoid of complications, in contrast with what had happened for &quot;Oceanborn&quot;. The main composer Tuomas Holopainen considers the album &quot;the most distant and least personal (...) in the Nightwish catalogue&quot;, despite containing the &quot;mother of all Nightwish songs - Dead Boys&#x27; Poem.&quot; The image of the dead boy would reappear in several songs of the following albums. &quot;Wishmaster&quot; was issued on 8 May 2000, a few days earlier than its scheduled release, because the music had leaked onto the Internet.

==Music style==
&quot;Wishmaster&quot;&#x27;s sound continues the bombastic symphonic power metal approach originally featured on &quot;Oceanborn&quot;, albeit with more emphasis on atmosphere and melody versus speed and heaviness. Perhaps even more so than its predecessor, &quot;Wishmaster&quot; has a very clear fantasy theme. While commonly considered to be closer to conventional power metal, there is still a great variety with slower songs like &quot;Two for Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Dead Boy&#x27;s Poem&quot;, and more epic pieces like &quot;FantasMic&quot;. &quot;The Kinslayer&quot; is written about the victims of the Columbine High School massacre. &quot;Wishmaster&quot; was inspired by the fantasy novel series &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, mentioning Elbereth, Lórien, and the Grey Havens from the former; and Dalamar, Raistlin Majere (Dalamar&#x27;s &quot;shalafi&quot;, or &quot;master&quot;), Gilthanas, the Sla-Mori, Silvara and the Inn of the Last Home from the latter. &quot;FantasMic&quot; is a song about the Disney animated movies, particularly their fantasy and fable elements, taking its title from the Disneyland show &quot;Fantasmic!&quot;.

<doc id="573879" wikidata="Q699800" url="?curid=573879" title="Moabit">
<text>Moabit () is an inner city locality in the borough of Mitte, Berlin, Germany. As of 2022, about 84,000 people lived in Moabit. First inhabited in 1685 and incorporated into Berlin in 1861, the former industrial and working-class neighbourhood is fully surrounded by three watercourses, which define its present-day border. Between 1945 and 1990, Moabit was part of the British sector of West Berlin and directly bordered East Berlin.

Until the administrative reform in 2001, Moabit was a part of the district of Tiergarten.

Colloquially, the name &quot;Moabit&quot; also refers to the Central Criminal Court (&quot;Strafgericht&quot;) and detention centre, which deals with all criminal cases in Berlin and is based in Moabit.

== Name ==
The origin of the name &quot;Moabit&quot; is disputed. According to one account, it can be traced back to the Huguenots, in the time of King Frederick William I of Prussia. These French refugees are said to have named their new residence in reference to the Biblical description of the Israelites in the country of Moab, where they stayed before being allowed to enter Canaan. Other possible origins include the German (Berlin dialect) &quot;Moorjebiet&quot; (swamp area).

== History ==

=== First settlements ===
In the 13th century the waste area along the road to Spandau known as &quot;Grosse Stadtheide&quot; (&quot;great city heath&quot;) was a hunting ground of the electors of Brandenburg. Settlement began in 1685 with the erection of the &quot;Staakensetzerhaus&quot; at the western border of what is now Moabit. 1716 saw the formation of the colony of &quot;Old Moabit&quot; by the Huguenots, who were meant to cultivate white mulberry trees for silkworms, but failed because of the low soil quality.

=== Industrialization ===
In 1818 &quot;New Moabit&quot; was founded and grew together with Old Moabit to an industrial suburb district, which was incorporated into the city of Berlin in 1861. The industrialization started in 1820 when, with the financial support of court counsellor Baillif, a simple bridge was built to connect the island to the Berlin mainland. The bridge was followed by factories, a power plant, the Berlin-Spandau Canal, the Westhafen port and the &quot;Hamburger Bahnhof&quot; train station which connected Berlin with Hamburg. A network of streets was laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. All of that activity resulted in an exponential growth of the population and the subsequent construction of tenements in Moabit and neighbouring Wedding, facilitating the spread of a smallpox epidemic.

In consequence, Berlin&#x27;s city council, exhorted to do so by Rudolf Virchow, built a second hospital (after the Charité), the &quot;Krankenhaus Moabit&quot; in 1872. In the 1880s, Robert Koch worked here on the sterilization of surgical instruments and the isolation of the tuberculosis bacterium. A teaching hospital from 1920 on, the &quot;Krankenhaus Moabit&quot; employed notable physicians like the Nobel Laureate Werner Forssmann, Lydia Rabinowitsch-Kempner and the resistance fighter Georg Groscurth.

A first prison, the &quot;Zellengefängnis&quot; (Cell Prison) on &quot;Lehrter Strasse&quot; was built between 1842 and 1849 by order of King Frederick William IV of Prussia, according to the &quot;separate system&quot; of Pentonville Prison. In 1878 Max Hödel, who had shot at Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany, was beheaded here. Political activists like Karl Radek, Erich Mühsam and Musa Cälil were detained in Moabit. Wilhelm Voigt, the &quot;Hauptmann von Köpenick&quot;, and the writer Wolfgang Borchert served their prison sentences in the prison.

The vast building of the Criminal Court on &quot;Turmstraße&quot; was erected in 1906. In 1909, architect Peter Behrens built the AEG&#x27;s Turbine factory at the north-western &quot;Huttenstraße&quot;, one of the first works of Modern architecture.

=== Labour movement and war period ===
Large parts of Moabit are traditional working-class residential areas. Some areas were known for their political activity during the Nazi era, such as the &quot;Red Beusselkiez&quot; or the neighbouring &quot;Rostock Kiez&quot;. After the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933 they were considered Communist resistance cells.

On 11 April 1928, during the Weimar Republic, the 20-year-old Communist activist Olga Benário and several of her comrades managed to break into Moabit&#x27;s prison and free the incarcerated Otto &quot;Li De&quot; Braun, a prominent party member and at the time Benario&#x27;s lover. Despite being hotly hunted, the two lovers succeeded in escaping to Moscow and later rose (separately) to prominence in the International Communist movement (in Brazil and China respectively).

Between 1941 and 1945, around 1900 Jews were deported predominantly to Auschwitz, Theresienstadt or Minsk. Approximately as many survived by escaping abroad.

=== Post-war and modern days ===
After the war, between 1945 and 1990, Moabit was part of the British sector of West Berlin. Due to its new peripheral location adjacent to the Berlin Wall, Moabit became a remote neighbourhood. Similar to Kreuzberg, it attracted mostly immigrants due to its low rents. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Moabit&#x27;s location has anew changed to its former centrality. Post-reunification, Moabit has faced problems such as drug trafficking and abuse (especially around &quot;Kleiner Tiergarten&quot;), poverty (most notably in its Western parts), and crime. Similar to neighbouring Wedding, lower rents have recently attracted artists and young people, and there are first unmistakable signs of gentrification.

At its eastern edge, bordering Mitte, Moabit&#x27;s neoclassical train station now serves as Berlin&#x27;s contemporary art museum, the Museum für Gegenwart.

The Center for Art and Urbanism (ZK/U) is located on the grounds of the Stadtgarten Moabit, in the former Berlin-Moabit freight station.

== Demographics ==
For a long time, Moabit was sparsely inhabited. Its population grew considerably after its incorporation into Berlin in 1861:
* 1801: 120 inhabitants
* 1805: 201 inhabitants
* 1861: 6,534 inhabitants
* 1871: 14,818 inhabitants
* 1880: 29,693 inhabitants
* 1910: inhabitants
* 2006: 75,181 inhabitants
*2018: 78,491 inhabitants
*2022: 81,148 inhabitants

Moabit&#x27;s modern-day population is among Berlin&#x27;s most diverse. , out of 84,148 inhabitants, 29,533 (35.10%) were non-German citizens. 46,113 (54.80%) had a migration background, making it one of the highest percentages alongside Gesundbrunnen, Neukölln, Kreuzberg and Wedding.

== Notable people ==
* Kurt Tucholsky, journalist, born 9 January 1890 in Moabit, Lübecker Straße 13, died 21 December 1935 in Gothenburg, Sweden
* Farin Urlaub, lead singer of German punk rock band Die Ärzte, born 27 October 1963 in Moabit
* In 1968/69 Uschi Obermaier and the members of the Kommune 1 lived in Moabit, Stephanstraße 60
* Sawsan Chebli, politician, born 1978 in Moabit

== In popular culture ==
Moabit is mentioned in countless books and films taking place in Germany or Berlin, primarily in reference to criminal court cases or incarcerations at the Central Criminal Court (Kriminalgericht) and detention centre. The district features briefly in Jonathan Franzen&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;Purity&quot; and also extensively in Dan Fesperman&#x27;s 2018 novel Safe Houses.

The Berlin-based band No Nebraska! released a song entitled &quot;Moabit is an Island&quot; on their EP &quot;Serves Six&quot; in 2007.

<text>The fine-tuned universe is the hypothesis that, because &quot;life as we know it&quot; could not exist if the constants of nature – such as the electron charge, the gravitational constant and others – had been even slightly different, the universe must be tuned specifically for life. In practice, this hypothesis is formulated in terms of dimensionless physical constants.

== History ==
In 1913, chemist Lawrence Joseph Henderson wrote &quot;The Fitness of the Environment,&quot; one of the first books to explore fine tuning in the universe. Henderson discusses the importance of water and the environment to living things, pointing out that life as it exists on Earth depends entirely on Earth&#x27;s very specific environmental conditions, especially the prevalence and properties of water.

In 1961, physicist Robert H. Dicke argued that certain forces in physics, such as gravity and electromagnetism, must be perfectly fine-tuned for life to exist in the universe. Fred Hoyle also argued for a fine-tuned universe in his 1983 book &quot;The Intelligent Universe&quot;, writing, &quot;The list of anthropic properties, apparent accidents of a non-biological nature without which carbon-based and hence human life could not exist, is large and impressive&quot;.

Belief in the fine-tuned universe led to the expectation that the Large Hadron Collider would produce evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry, but by 2012 it had not produced evidence for supersymmetry at the energy scales it was able to probe.

== Motivation ==
Physicist Paul Davies said: &quot;There is now broad agreement among physicists and cosmologists that the Universe is in several respects &#x27;fine-tuned&#x27; for life. But the conclusion is not so much that the Universe is fine-tuned for life; rather it is fine-tuned for the building blocks and environments that life requires&quot;. He also said that anthropic&#x27; reasoning fails to distinguish between minimally biophilic universes, in which life is permitted, but only marginally possible, and optimally biophilic universes, in which life flourishes because biogenesis occurs frequently&quot;. Among scientists who find the evidence persuasive, a variety of natural explanations have been proposed, such as the existence of multiple universes introducing a survivorship bias under the anthropic principle.

The premise of the fine-tuned universe assertion is that a small change in several of the physical constants would make the universe radically different. Stephen Hawking observed: &quot;The laws of science, as we know them at present, contain many fundamental numbers, like the size of the electric charge of the electron and the ratio of the masses of the proton and the electron. ... The remarkable fact is that the values of these numbers seem to have been very finely adjusted to make possible the development of life&quot;.

For example, if the strong nuclear force were 2% stronger than it is (i.e. if the coupling constant representing its strength were 2% larger) while the other constants were left unchanged, diprotons would be stable; according to Davies, hydrogen would fuse into them instead of deuterium and helium. This would drastically alter the physics of stars, and presumably preclude the existence of life similar to what we observe on Earth. The diproton&#x27;s existence would short-circuit the slow fusion of hydrogen into deuterium. Hydrogen would fuse so easily that it is likely that all the universe&#x27;s hydrogen would be consumed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang. This &quot;diproton argument&quot; is disputed by other physicists, who calculate that as long as the increase in strength is less than 50%, stellar fusion could occur despite the existence of stable diprotons.

The precise formulation of the idea is made difficult by the fact that it is not yet known how many independent physical constants there are. The standard model of particle physics has 25 freely adjustable parameters and general relativity has one more, the cosmological constant, which is known to be nonzero but profoundly small in value. Because physicists have not developed an empirically successful theory of quantum gravity, there is no known way to combine quantum mechanics, on which the standard model depends, and general relativity.

Without knowledge of this more complete theory suspected to underlie the standard model, it is impossible to definitively count the number of truly independent physical constants. In some candidate theories, the number of independent physical constants may be as small as one. For example, the cosmological constant may be a fundamental constant but attempts have also been made to calculate it from other constants, and according to the author of one such calculation, &quot;the small value of the cosmological constant is telling us that a remarkably precise and totally unexpected relation exists among all the parameters of the Standard Model of particle physics, the bare cosmological constant and unknown physics&quot;.

== Examples ==
Martin Rees formulates the fine-tuning of the universe in terms of the following six dimensionless physical constants.
* &quot;N&quot;, the ratio of the electromagnetic force to the gravitational force between a pair of protons, is approximately 1036. According to Rees, if it were significantly smaller, only a small and short-lived universe could exist. If it were large enough, they would repel them so violently that larger atoms would never be generated.
* &quot;Epsilon&quot; (&quot;ε&quot;), a measure of the nuclear efficiency of fusion from hydrogen to helium, is 0.007: when four nucleons fuse into helium, 0.007 (0.7%) of their mass is converted to energy. The value of &quot;ε&quot; is in part determined by the strength of the strong nuclear force. If &quot;ε&quot; were 0.006, a proton could not bond to a neutron, and only hydrogen could exist, and complex chemistry would be impossible. According to Rees, if it were above 0.008, no hydrogen would exist, as all the hydrogen would have been fused shortly after the Big Bang. Other physicists disagree, calculating that substantial hydrogen remains as long as the strong force coupling constant increases by less than about 50%.
* &quot;Omega&quot; (Ω), commonly known as the density parameter, is the relative importance of gravity and expansion energy in the universe. It is the ratio of the mass density of the universe to the &quot;critical density&quot; and is approximately 1. If gravity were too strong compared with dark energy and the initial cosmic expansion rate, the universe would have collapsed before life could have evolved. If gravity were too weak, no stars would have formed.
* &quot;Lambda&quot; (Λ), commonly known as the cosmological constant, describes the ratio of the density of dark energy to the critical energy density of the universe, given certain reasonable assumptions such as that dark energy density is a constant. In terms of Planck units, and as a natural dimensionless value, Λ is on the order of . This is so small that it has no significant effect on cosmic structures that are smaller than a billion light-years across. A slightly larger value of the cosmological constant would have caused space to expand rapidly enough that stars and other astronomical structures would not be able to form.
* &quot;Q&quot;, the ratio of the gravitational energy required to pull a large galaxy apart to the energy equivalent of its mass, is around 10−5. If it is too small, no stars can form. If it is too large, no stars can survive because the universe is too violent, according to Rees.
* &quot;D&quot;, the number of spatial dimensions in spacetime, is 3. Rees claims that life could not exist if there were 2 or 4 spatial dimensions. Rees argues this does not preclude the existence of ten-dimensional strings.
Max Tegmark argued that if there is more than one time dimension, then physical systems&#x27; behavior could not be predicted reliably from knowledge of the relevant partial differential equations. In such a universe, intelligent life capable of manipulating technology could not emerge. Moreover, protons and electrons would be unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than themselves. This is not a problem if the particles have a sufficiently low temperature.

=== Carbon and oxygen ===

An older example is the Hoyle state, the third-lowest energy state of the carbon-12 nucleus, with an energy of 7.656 MeV above the ground level. According to one calculation, if the state&#x27;s energy level were lower than 7.3 or greater than 7.9 MeV, insufficient carbon would exist to support life. To explain the universe&#x27;s abundance of carbon, the Hoyle state must be further tuned to a value between 7.596 and 7.716 MeV. A similar calculation, focusing on the underlying fundamental constants that give rise to various energy levels, concludes that the strong force must be tuned to a precision of at least 0.5%, and the electromagnetic force to a precision of at least 4%, to prevent either carbon production or oxygen production from dropping significantly.

== Explanations ==
Some explanations of fine-tuning are naturalistic. First, the fine-tuning might be an illusion: more fundamental physics may explain the apparent fine-tuning in physical parameters in the current understanding by constraining the values those parameters are likely to take. As Lawrence Krauss put it, &quot;certain quantities have seemed inexplicable and fine-tuned, and once we understand them, they don&#x27;t seem to be so fine-tuned. We have to have some historical perspective&quot;. Some argue it is possible that a final fundamental theory of everything will explain the underlying causes of the apparent fine-tuning in every parameter.

Still, as modern cosmology developed, various hypotheses not presuming hidden order have been proposed. One is a multiverse, where fundamental physical constants are postulated to have different values outside of the known universe. On this hypothesis, separate parts of reality would have wildly different characteristics. In such scenarios, the appearance of fine-tuning is explained as a consequence of the weak anthropic principle and selection bias, specifically survivorship bias. Only those universes with fundamental constants hospitable to life, such as on Earth, could contain life forms capable of observing the universe who can contemplate the question of fine-tuning. Zhi-Wei Wang and Samuel L. Braunstein argue that the apparent fine-tuning of fundamental constants could be due to the lack of understanding of these constants.

=== Multiverse ===
If the universe is just one of many and possibly infinite universes, each with different physical phenomena and constants, it is unsurprising that there is a universe hospitable to intelligent life. Some versions of the multiverse hypothesis therefore provide a simple explanation for any fine-tuning, while the analysis of Wang and Braunstein challenges the view that this universe is unique in its ability to support life.

The multiverse idea has led to considerable research into the anthropic principle and has been of particular interest to particle physicists because theories of everything do apparently generate large numbers of universes in which the physical constants vary widely. Although there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, some versions of the theory make predictions of which some researchers studying M-theory and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence soon. According to Laura Mersini-Houghton, the WMAP cold spot could provide testable empirical evidence of a parallel universe. Variants of this approach include Lee Smolin&#x27;s notion of cosmological natural selection, the ekpyrotic universe, and the bubble universe theory.

It has been suggested that invoking the multiverse to explain fine-tuning is a form of the inverse gambler&#x27;s fallacy.

=== Top-down cosmology ===
Stephen Hawking and Thomas Hertog proposed that the universe&#x27;s initial conditions consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions, only a small fraction of which contributed to the conditions seen today. According to their theory, the universe&#x27;s &quot;fine-tuned&quot; physical constants are inevitable, because the universe &quot;selects&quot; only those histories that led to the present conditions. In this way, top-down cosmology provides an anthropic explanation for why this universe allows matter and life without invoking the multiverse.

=== Carbon chauvinism ===
Some forms of fine-tuning arguments about the formation of life assume that only carbon-based life forms are possible, an assumption sometimes called carbon chauvinism. Conceptually, alternative biochemistry or other forms of life are possible.

=== Simulation hypothesis ===
The simulation hypothesis holds that the universe is fine-tuned simply because the more technologically advanced simulation operator(s) programmed it that way.

=== No improbability ===
Graham Priest, Mark Colyvan, Jay L. Garfield, and others have argued against the presupposition that &quot;the laws of physics or the boundary conditions of the universe could have been other than they are&quot;.

== Religious apologetics ==
Some scientists, theologians, and philosophers, as well as certain religious groups, argue that providence or creation are responsible for fine-tuning. Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga argues that random chance, applied to a single and sole universe, only raises the question as to why this universe could be so &quot;lucky&quot; as to have precise conditions that support life at least at some place (the Earth) and time (within millions of years of the present).

William Lane Craig, a philosopher and Christian apologist, cites this fine-tuning of the universe as evidence for the existence of God or some form of intelligence capable of manipulating (or designing) the basic physics that governs the universe. Philosopher and theologian Richard Swinburne reaches the design conclusion using Bayesian probability. Scientist and theologian Alister McGrath observed that the fine-tuning of carbon is even responsible for nature&#x27;s ability to tune itself to any degree.

The entire biological evolutionary process depends upon the unusual chemistry of carbon, which allows it to bond to itself, as well as other elements, creating highly complex molecules that are stable over prevailing terrestrial temperatures, and are capable of conveying genetic information (especially DNA). [...] Whereas it might be argued that nature creates its own fine-tuning, this can only be done if the primordial constituents of the universe are such that an evolutionary process can be initiated. The unique chemistry of carbon is the ultimate foundation of the capacity of nature to tune itself.

Theoretical physicist and Anglican priest John Polkinghorne stated: &quot;Anthropic fine tuning is too remarkable to be dismissed as just a happy accident&quot;.

Theologian and philosopher Andrew Loke argues that there are only five possible categories of hypotheses concerning fine-tuning and order: (i) chance, (ii) regularity, (iii) combinations of regularity and chance, (iv) uncaused, and (v) design, and that only design gives an exclusively logical explanation of order in the universe. He argues that the Kalam Cosmological Argument strengthens the teleological argument by answering the question &quot;Who designed the Designer?&quot;.

Creationist Hugh Ross advances a number of fine-tuning hypotheses. One is the existence of what Ross calls &quot;vital poisons&quot;, which are elemental nutrients that are harmful in large quantities but essential for animal life in smaller quantities.

Philosopher and theologian Robin Collins argues that theism entails the expectation that God would create a reality structured to realize a positive, and if possible optimal, balance of good over evil. Thus it is not surprising, Collins contends, that we can find moral or aesthetic value in the world&#x27;s features, such as the elegance and harmony of the laws of nature. 

Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins dismisses the theistic argument as &quot;deeply unsatisfying&quot; since it leaves the existence of God unexplained, with a God capable of calculating the fine-tuning at least as improbable as the fine-tuning itself. Against this claim, it has been argued that theism is a simple hypothesis, allowing theists to deny that God is at least as improbable as the fine-tuning.

<text>The Silver Line is a system of bus routes in Boston and Chelsea, Massachusetts, operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). It is operated as part of the MBTA bus system, but branded as bus rapid transit (BRT) as part of the MBTA subway system. Six routes are operated as part of two disconnected corridors. , weekday ridership on the Silver Line was 27,000.

The four Waterfront routes operate out of an underground terminal at and run through the South Boston Piers Transitway – a dedicated bus tunnel through the Seaport District with stations at and . At , they fan out on the surface: the SL1 to Logan International Airport, the SL2 to Dry Dock Avenue, and the SL3 to via East Boston. An additional short turn route, SLW, runs only at peak hours between South Station and Silver Line Way. The Waterfront routes use mostly articulated diesel hybrid buses with extended battery range. Two routes operate on Washington Street between Nubian station (at Nubian Square in Roxbury) and Downtown Boston. The SL5 terminates at and the SL4 on the surface at . The Washington Street routes use articulated diesel hybrid buses.

The Washington Street corridor was built to replace the Washington Street Elevated, which was used by the Orange Line rapid transit line until 1987. Initial plans called for a light rail branch of the Green Line, but trolleybuses and later CNG buses were substituted. Planning began in 1987 for mass transit to serve the growing Seaport; a new transit tunnel called the South Boston Piers Transitway was chosen in 1989. It was to run from to World Trade Center via and South Station, though the Boylston–South Station section was later deferred as a separate phase. In 1999, the MBTA designated the Washington Street and Transitway projects as the Silver Line, and planned for the Boylston tunnel extension to include a portal to Washington Street for through-running. Service improvements on Washington Street began in 2001. After years of delays, service through the $624 million Transitway began on December 17, 2004.

The connecting tunnel (Phase III) was cancelled in 2010 due to rising costs; a surface route (SL4) was introduced the previous year. The original SL3 route to was discontinued on March 20, 2009. A separate SL3 route to Chelsea – originally planned as part of the cancelled Urban Ring Project – began service on April 21, 2018. Extension of the SL3 route to is planned. Several other Silver Line extensions have been proposed, as has a conversion of the Washington Street corridor to light rail, but most have not been pursued. The Silver Line has been the target of criticism by riders and transportation planners. Much of the system is missing BRT Standard features such as enforced dedicated lanes, off-vehicle fare collection, sheltered stations, and transit signal priority.

==Routes==
===Waterfront: SL1, SL2, SL3===

Three Silver Line services operate from in a dedicated tunnel, the South Boston Piers Transitway, serving the underground and stations in the Seaport District then splitting at the surface station:
* SL1 Logan Airport–South Station
* SL2 Drydock–South Station
* SL3 Chelsea–South Station
During rush hours, additional short turns (designated SLW) are run between South Station and Silver Line Way to increase frequency in the Transitway.

Route SL2 runs on Northern Avenue, then on a one-way loop on Drydock Avenue and Black Falcon Avenue with multiple stops serving the Raymond L. Flynn Marine Park and the Flynn Cruiseport Boston. Buses run clockwise around the loop, with a layover at 23 Drydock Avenue. From Silver Line Way, route SL1 and SL3 buses loop backwards on Haul Road, then cross under Boston Harbor in the Ted Williams Tunnel to East Boston. Route SL1 loops around the Logan International Airport terminals, with stops at the arrivals level of each terminal (including two separate stops at lengthy Terminal B). Route SL3 serves station, follows the Coughlin Bypass Road, and crosses Chelsea Creek on the Chelsea Street Bridge. It then follows a dedicated busway to , with intermediate stops at , , and . The three Transitway stops are full rapid transit stations; the Chelsea busway stations have large concrete shelters, while most other surface stops have small shelters.

The Waterfront routes have regular rapid transit fares. Passengers enter through faregates at the three Transitway stations, and pay at the on-board farebox at all other stops. Fares are free when boarding at the Logan Airport stops. Transfer is possible to the Red Line within fare control at South Station. Normal transfers to other routes are available with a CharlieCard; transfers to/from the Blue Line at Airport and the Washington Street routes are available with a CharlieTicket.

The Waterfront routes use articulated buses with three doors, which provide greater capacity than standard transit buses. The buses are low-floor and fully accessible, with kneeling bus technology and a wheelchair ramp at the front door. The main Waterfront fleet consists of 45 diesel hybrid buses with extended battery range – sufficient to run through the Transitway on battery power – which were delivered in 2022–2023. A similar extended-battery-range hybrid bus built in 2018 and five battery electric buses built in 2019 are also used. All Silver Line buses are maintained at Southampton Street Garage.

The Waterfront routes previously used dual-mode buses which operated as electric trolleybuses between South Station and Silver Line Way, and as conventional diesel buses on the surface branches. The 32 dual-mode buses, built by Neoplan USA, were delivered in 2004–05 and overhauled from 2014 to 2018. Eight of the buses were funded by Massport and included luggage racks for airport passengers. The dual-mode buses (and overhead lines in the Transitway) proved difficult to maintain and required a time-consuming switch between modes at Silver Line Way. In 2018–19, the MBTA obtained several buses to test alternate options for Waterfront service. A single New Flyer diesel hybrid bus with extended battery range was obtained as an option on a separate order; it entered testing in September 2018 and revenue service in December. On July 31, 2019, the MBTA began using five New Flyer battery electric buses on both Waterfront and Washington Street routes. In November 2020, the MBTA exercised a contract option for 45 additional 60-foot hybrid buses with extended battery range similar to the 2018 test bus to replace the dual-mode Silver Line fleet. The final dual-mode buses were retired in July 2023, ending trolleybus operations in the Boston area.

===Washington Street: SL4 and SL5===

Two Silver Line routes run between Nubian station (at Nubian Square in Roxbury) and Downtown Boston along Washington Street:
* SL4 Nubian station–South Station
* SL5 Nubian station–Downtown Crossing

These two routes share most of their routing on Washington Street between Nubian Square and , with dedicated lanes for most of the corridor and eight intermediate stops. North of Kneeland Street, the routes run on separate one-way loops. The SL5 runs north on Washington Street to Temple Place (between and , with an intermediate stop at . It returns south on Tremont Street, with a southbound stop at . The SL4 runs north on Washington Street to Chinatown, then east on Essex Street (with a dedicated lane) to a surface stop at . It returns south on Surface Road and Kneeland Street. Most stops have a canopy shelter with seating, maps, and a real-time arrival information display.

The two routes have the same fare as local bus services (lower than rapid transit), with normal transfers with a CharlieCard. In recognition of their role as replacement for the Orange Line, transfers are also available with a paper CharlieTicket (which normally does not allow transfers). This was inherited from the previous route 49 bus, which had free transfers (with the flat token fare) to and from the Orange Line only at .

The Washington Street routes use diesel hybrid articulated buses with three doors. The buses are low-floor and fully accessible, with kneeling bus technology and a wheelchair ramp at the front door. The routes use 21 New Flyer buses delivered in 2016–17 (part of a 44-bus order also used on routes and ), which replaced the original compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, plus three similar hybrid buses delivered in 2010. All Silver Line buses are maintained at Southampton Street Garage.

==History==
===Washington Street development===

The 1947 state act that created the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) from the Boston Elevated Railway established four immediate projects for the new agency: extension of rapid transit to , expansion of the Tremont Street Subway to four tracks, replacement of the existing elevated lines (Charlestown Elevated, Causeway Street Elevated, and Washington Street Elevated) with subways, and an extension of the Cambridge–Dorchester line northwest from . In 1948, the legislature authorized the city to issue $19 million in bonds (equivalent to $ in ) to construct an extension of the Washington Street Tunnel under Shawmut Street, connecting with the existing elevated south of Dudley Square. Although none of the proposals were built immediately, it established a precedent of replacing the elevated lines. In 1972, protests led to cancellation of the planned Southwest Expressway. Instead, the alignment was used for a combined corridor for intercity rail, commuter rail, and the Orange Line – replacing the Washington Street Elevated of the latter.

The northern part of the new corridor was about west of Washington Street, so the MBTA (which had replaced the MTA in 1964) began planning in 1978 for a replacement service between Dudley Square and Downtown Boston. By 1985, the MBTA favored bus or light rail service on Washington Street; the latter would have been a branch of the Green Line, operated through the 1962-abandoned southern branch. The Orange Line was rerouted in 1987; that year, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration rejected the MBTA&#x27;s funding request to create a light rail line on the corridor. Local opinion favored the temporary retention of the northern portion of the Elevated until a permanent replacement could be built. However, the MBTA closed the Elevated and instead upgraded the route 49 bus from a feeder route to a more frequent trunk route.

In 1989, the MBTA announced that trolleybuses would be used on Washington Street, operating on 4-minute headways at peak hours. By 1990, the MBTA expected service to begin in 1993, with an underground connection to Boylston station and the proposed South Boston Piers tunnel in a future phase. After several more years of studies, the MBTA decided in 1996–97 to build the route as a bus rapid transit line using compressed natural gas (CNG) buses to avoid the visual impact of overhead wires. Environmental documentation was filed in 1998, and construction began in 2001. The project cost $27.3 million, with major elements including $10.9 million for the 17 new buses, $10.9 million for road work, and $2.6 million for shelters. Planning and construction were combined with a necessary repaving of Washington Street, reducing costs. Intended for the route to equal the service quality of light rail, the MBTA branded it as the &quot;Silver Line&quot; and designated it equally to the existing MBTA subway lines on maps. The Silver Line name was introduced in 1996.

The Silver Line followed largely the same route between Dudley Square and Downtown Boston as route 49; the primary change was the consolidation of stops. Although the MBTA considered other stop locations, most of the final stops were at existing route 49 stops. The conversion to the Silver Line occurred in several steps. In December 2001, the MBTA opened a contraflow bus-only lane on Washington Street between Marginal Road and East Berkeley Street, allowing southbound buses to use Washington Street. This eliminated a longer outbound routing via Surface Road, and allowed an extension to a new downtown terminal at Temple Place (between and stations). Service frequency was also increased at that time. On July 20, 2002, new Silver Line-branded CNG buses began operation – the first low-floor buses to operate in Boston – and the 20 stops were reduced to 11. In November 2002, a twelfth stop at was restored. The were replaced by buses in August 2003, and service frequency was again increased. On January 31, 2005, the route was the first MBTA bus route to receive new automated fare collection equipment. By 2005, ridership was double that of route 49, but early decreases in travel time were cancelled out by longer dwell times. 

In February 2020, the MBTA agreed to change the name of Dudley Square station to Nubian, following the December 2019 renaming of the square itself. The station renaming took effect in June 2020. In May 2022, the MBTA released a draft plan for a systemwide network redesign. The draft called for the SL4 and SL5 to be combined into a single Nubian–South Station route to provide simpler and more consistent downtown service. The November 2022 draft network plan kept the same proposal. An additional SL4 stop (Chinatown Gate) on Surface Artery at Kneeland Street in Chinatown was added on August 19, 2022, while the Orange Line was closed for maintenance work; it was retained after the closure.

===Waterfront development===
For most of the 20th century, the Seaport District was an industrial area occupied by rail yards and wharves; the South Boston Army Base and South Boston Naval Annex were served by short bus routes that connected with the Red Line at . After the military bases closed in 1974 and the rail yards were no longer needed, the Seaport was designated for commercial development, with accompanying need for expanded transit. The MBTA conducted a feasibility study in 1987 and released a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) in 1989. The DEIR selected an underground &quot;transitway&quot; over alternatives including a surface light rail line, an elevated people mover, a commuter rail shuttle, and a relocation of the Red Line. The transitway was to use trolleybuses or dual-mode buses, rather than the light rail and people mover possibilities considered; it would connect with the Red Line at South Station, the Orange Line at , and the Green Line at . Costs could be reduced by combining its construction with the upcoming Central Artery/Tunnel Project (&quot;Big Dig&quot;). Service from the transitway could be extended to serve Logan International Airport, to form part of a proposed circumferential transit line, and to connect with the planned Washington Street service.

The South Boston Piers Transitway alignment was refined by the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIR) in 1992. The Final Environmental Impact Statement/Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIS/FEIR) was approved in December 1993. The South Station–Seaport segment was to open in 2000, with the Boylston segment opening in 2006. The stations at , , South Station, Chinatown, and Boylston would each have island platforms, and the tunnel could be later converted to light rail as a Green Line branch if needed. Daily ridership was expected to be between 24,200 and 37,200 for the first phase, and between 34,800 and 69,800 for the full build, depending on the rate of commercial development. In November 1994, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) agreed to fund $331 million (80%) of the $413 million first phase, which was to be completed in December 2000. The environmental approval process was completed in April 1995.

In 1997, with construction on the transitway already under way, Massport cancelled a planned people mover at Logan Airport in favor of dual-mode buses operating from the transitway and through the newly-opened Ted Williams Tunnel. A connector road was to extend the transitway from D Street to Haul Road. These changes were approved in February 1998. In May 1999, the MBTA indicated plans to through-route the transitway with the planned Washington Street service as the &quot;Silver Line&quot;, with the Washington Street service as Phase I, the initial Transitway build as Phase II, and the Boylston extension as Phase III.

Initial construction of the Transitway was divided into four main sections: South Station and turnaround loop plus of tunnel ($96 million), Russia Wharf and Fort Point Channel tunnel ($128 million), Courthouse station plus of tunnel ($110 million), and World Trade Center station plus of tunnel ($43 million). The Russia Wharf section, using the New Austrian tunnelling method, was the most technically complex; ground freezing was required to support the historic Russia Wharf Buildings. It also included an immersed tube under the Fort Point Channel. The discovery of a massive boulder under the Channel delayed the project by a year. By late 2000, the project was three years behind schedule and almost $200 million over budget; the MBTA diverted $150 million of other federal grants and $50 million of contingency funds to cover the costs. The Transitway was ultimately completed in 2004, with a final cost to the MBTA of $624 million. Although some projects like the new federal courthouse and the new convention center had been built, commercial development had lagged early plans; the MBTA adjusted its 2006 daily ridership projections from 45,000 to 14,000 shortly before opening.

The Transitway opened on December 17, 2004, with the Waterfront shuttle route between South Station and Silver Line operated by a mix of new dual-mode buses and trolleybuses borrowed from the Harvard-based routes. It was only the third &quot;urban trolleybus subway&quot; (tunnel with stations) in the world, after the Harvard bus tunnel and the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel (in which trolleybus service ended in 2005). Original plans called for a single South Boston route running to via D Street, Broadway, Summer Street, and E 1st Street. After concerns from residents over reduction of legal parking spaces and impacts to the &quot;local custom&quot; of double parking, this was split into two routes: one running to via D Street, and one to City Point via D Street and E 1st Street.

On December 31, 2004, service began on routes SL2 to the Boston Marine Industrial Park and route SL3 to City Point – the latter running via Northern Avenue, Drydock Avenue, and Summer Street rather than D Street. Two days later, a Sunday-only Silver Line Way-Logan Airport shuttle service called &quot;Silver Line Connector&quot; began operation to meet a legal commitment to begin airport service that month. The existing surface routes in the Seaport were discontinued or rerouted in January. Due to a lack of available dual-mode buses, CNG shuttles operated on the surface sections of the SL2 and SL3 routes from January 5 to March 14, 2005. On March 26, the two routes were combined on nights and weekends. On April 9, weekday SL3 service was extended from City Point to a loop on Farragut Road. On May 28, 2005, the two routes were combined at all times as the SL2/3. This freed up buses for SL1 service to Logan Airport, which began on June 1. As more buses entered service, the SL2 and SL3 were re-split into separate routes (except nights and weekends) on August 20, and the Farragut Road loop was cut due to noise complaints from residents. On October 15, City Point service was cut on nights and weekends. The planned SL4 route to Andrew, expected to begin service in 2005, was never implemented.

As enough dual-mode buses became available, the borrowed 40-foot trolleybuses were phased out; they were last used on February 12, 2006. By 2006, the Silver Line had doubled transit ridership to the Seaport, and increased transit ridership to Logan by 24%. The SL3 service was never successful, as the parallel route had a more direct routing, lower fares, and better downtown connections. By 2008, the SL3 averaged less than one passenger per trip on the segment not shared with the SL2. On March 20, 2009, SL3 service was cut, with SL2 service increased in its stead. In October 2009, the SL2 terminus was renamed &quot;Design Center&quot; with no changes in service.

Until 2019, SL2 buses served the Design Center loop in two different patterns. Before noon, outbound buses proceeded around the whole loop, laid over at the Design Center stop, then proceeded inbound. After noon, outbound buses made a shorter western loop, laid over at Design Center, then proceeded inbound via the main loop. On December 22, 2019, the route was changed so that buses proceeded around the whole loop before the layover at all times. On March 15, 2020, afternoon service began laying over at 23 Dry Dock Avenue before making the loop.

In January 2021, Massport approved a ground lease agreement for air rights development over Silver Line Way station, which will include improvements to the stop. On March 13, 2022, all SL2 buses began laying over at 23 Dry Dock Avenue. The stop at 88 Black Falcon Avenue, closed since April 2019 due to pier repairs, was permanently cut at that time. An improved stop on the east side of 27 Drydock Avenue (at Black Falcon Avenue) is planned by 2025 as part of redevelopment of 88 Black Falcon Avenue. The May 2022 draft network plan called for routes SL1 and SL3 to use D Street to more directly access the Ted Williams Tunnel, with only route SL2 plus SLW shuttles serving Silver Line Way. The November 2022 revised proposal kept this change, with SL2 enhanced to higher frequency service all days.
=== Phase III plans ===

The Boylston extension, as planned in 1993, would have run west from South Station under Essex Street, Avenue de Lafayette, and Avery Street. The Chinatown platform would have been under Hayward Place east of Washington Street, and the Boylston platform under the existing Green Line station, with a turnaround loop under Boylston Street and the Central Burying Ground. The 1999 decision to combine the Waterfront and Washington Street projects as the Silver Line resulted in the addition of a southern segment, likely using the same abandoned streetcar tunnel as had been proposed a decade before. A new underground station would have been built under Tremont Street, connecting to the existing (NEMC) station, with a portal to Washington Street just north of Oak Street. In April 2000, the MBTA adjusted the alignment to use Boylston Street instead of Avenue de Lafayette and Avery Street, with side platforms at the stations. The new alignment would conflict less with development, provide a straighter route, avoid the need for a pedestrian crossing and a lengthy pedestrian tunnel at Chinatown, and move the Boylston loop away from the Burying Ground.

In January 2002, the MBTA began seeking federal funding for 60% of the project cost. The FTA approved the project for further planning that July. The Boston Regional Metropolitan Planning Organization rated the project as &quot;high priority&quot; in its May 2003 Program for Mass Transportation, citing its high estimated ridership, low operating cost and service to environmental justice neighborhoods. In 2003, the preferred portal location was moved slightly north to avoid the need to demolish the YMCA building, and the NEMC station was removed. A proposal to consolidate the Chinatown and Boylston stations was rejected due to steep grades required and lack of cost savings, and a proposal to eliminate the loop was rejected because of the need to short turn most buses at Boylston. Further changes in 2003–04 were caused by the need to add a second platform at Boylston due to high expected ridership, and to reduce impacts to the historic Boston Common from the loop. One alternative placed the station and loop under Tremont Street south of Boylston Street; the other enlarged them under the Common.

Continued concerns about the Common, concerns from Bay Village residents about impacts to Eliot Norton Park, and desires to add Back Bay service resulted in further changes in 2004–05. The platforms at Boylston were to be aligned east–west under Boylston Street west of Tremont Street, with the loop further to the west at Charles Street. New portal alignments were considered, including one on Columbus Avenue to the southwest. Capital cost was originally estimated at $768–812 million depending on the portal location; completion was moved from 2010 to 2013. Daily ridership for the completed Silver Line system was estimated to reach 160,000 by 2025. In August 2005, the MBTA put the Phase III project &quot;on hold&quot; in order to build community consensus on a locally preferred routing.

In February 2006, State Transportation Secretary John Cogliano proposed a $94 million plan that would eliminate most of the tunneling and cost of the original proposal while still connecting the two phases of the service. Under Cogliano&#x27;s plan, the Silver Line would run on the surface via Kneeland Street and Surface Road to a new tunnel portal on Essex Street near South Station. A fare-controlled shelter would be added at Downtown Crossing for routes still terminating there. The plan also included expansion of surface Silver Line service, with a new branch running from Copley Square into the Essex Street portal to provide a one-seat ride from the Back Bay area. The southern branch would be extended from Dudley to the Red Line stations at via Blue Hill Avenue (replacing route ) and via Washington Street (replacing route ) The plan was popular with Bay Village residents who had been worried about the full-length tunnel, but attracted criticism because it would not substantially speed travel times to downtown.

A revised tunnel plan was put forward in March 2006, with support from most transportation leaders including Cogliano. The plan involved a variation of the Charles Street tunnel alignment, with the portal moved southwest onto Tremont Street near Marginal Road. This &quot;Charles Street Modified&quot; alignment remained the preferred alternative for the remainder of the project. Contra-flow dedicated bus lanes, already in place on Washington Street, were to be extended onto Marginal Road and Herald Street to allow buses to reach the portal from the surface section. On December 12, 2006, the FTA approved the project to re-enter its funding process. By mid-2008, environmental review and preliminary engineering were expected to be completed by the end of the year, with federal funding sought in 2010 and construction lasting from 2011 to a 2016 opening.

However, the estimated price of the tunnel plan, dubbed the &quot;Little Dig&quot;, had risen to $2.1 billion by May 2009. The FTA assigned it a &quot;Medium Low&quot; overall rating, making it ineligible to move into the final design phase for federal New Starts funding. The Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization removed Phase III from the list of recommended projects in its long range plan because of funding limitations. Concluding that it could not successfully compete for more than one New Starts grant, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) informed the FTA that it was no longer seeking New Starts money for Phase III. All New Starts funds available would instead be directed to the legally mandated Green Line Extension project. In a July 2010 report, the MBTA declared that Phase III was on indefinite hold and no further funds would be spent on the project.

A partial solution that did not require a new tunnel opened on October 13, 2009, after expedited construction using federal stimulus money. The new route, SL4, covered much of the same alignment as the proposed Phase III, with a dedicated bus lane on Essex Street and a South Station stop west of Atlantic Avenue. The existing Downtown Crossing-Dudley route was renamed SL5 at that time.

===Extension to Chelsea===

The Urban Ring Project was a planned circumferential surface BRT line. It would have shared the Silver Line berths at Dudley Square, and have had a surface stop outside World Trade Center station, but otherwise would have been separate from the Silver Line. The project was cancelled in 2010 due to high cost, but planning for several smaller sections continued. The Chelsea–South Boston section was given high priority because Chelsea was densely populated yet underserved by transit. MassDOT had also purchased the Grand Junction Branch – including abandoned sections in Chelsea and East Boston – from CSX Transportation in 2010, meaning that a potential right-of-way (which the Urban Ring had proposed to use) was available. A state study in 2011 analyzed potential Chelsea services, including a Silver Line branch to Bellingham Square or the Chelsea commuter rail station, or improvements to the route bus.

In 2013, MassDOT began public planning of the &quot;Silver Line Gateway&quot; project. In addition to serving Chelsea, the proposed line would provide Blue Line riders a direct connection to the Seaport and South Station. Three possible alignments were studied. All used the Transitway and the Ted Williams Tunnel to reach station, then the 2012-opened Coughlin Bypass Road to the Chelsea Street Bridge. The first alignment was to run entirely on a new busway on the Grand Junction right-of-way in Chelsea, with stops at , , at the Chelsea commuter rail station, and Mystic Mall. The second alignment option would have followed the Grand Junction to just short of the commuter rail station, then diverge onto surface roads to Bellingham Square, while the third alignment would have run entirely on surface streets, serving two stops on Central Avenue and four stops along a loop serving Chelsea station and the MGH Chelsea healthcare center.

In September 2013, the MBTA indicated that it would pursue the first alternative, with an estimated daily ridership of 8,700, despite potential issues with bridge clearances and rebuilding the commuter rail station. On October 30, 2013, MassDOT announced $82.5 million in state funding for the new Silver Line route to Chelsea, with completion expected in 2015. The announcement also included the relocation of the commuter rail station to (Mystic Mall) and a $3 million, multi-use path from Eastern Avenue to Washington Street. The Environmental Impact Report was issued in March 2014. MassDOT awarded a $33.8 million construction contract for the first phase of the project on September 17, 2014. That phase included the -long busway, the four Silver Line stations, replacement of the Washington Street bridge, and the Chelsea Greenway.

Silver Line service to Chelsea (route SL3) began on April 21, 2018. By October, daily ridership reached 6,200. The second phase of the project includes the relocated Chelsea commuter rail station plus transit signal priority upgrades for the SL3. Construction began in August 2019; the new station opened on November 15, 2021. , the MBTA and the City of Boston plan to reconfigure Day Square in East Boston in late 2024. The project would include bus lanes on Chelsea Street and a bus-only street through Day Square, with a Day Square station for use by the SL3 and local bus routes.
===Sullivan Square extension===
In March 2019, state and local officials indicated plans to extend service from on two routes to Kendall Square and to North Station, both via Sullivan Square. The routes would primarily use dedicated busways and bus lanes, although it was not decided whether they would be under the Silver Line brand. In January 2021, the MBTA and MassDOT began work on the Silver Line Extension (SLX), which would look into route alternatives from Chelsea into Everett, Somerville, Cambridge, and Boston. Six potential corridors were identified by September 2021: to , to Sullivan, to , to downtown Boston via Sullivan, to Kendall Square via Sullivan, and to Kendall Square via Wellington. Some corridors could be operated as new routes independent from the SL3, with Chelsea or Airport as potential termini rather than South Station.

Alternatives were presented in September 2022. Three potential SL3 extensions would run to Malden Center, Wellington, or Sullivan – all via Everett Square, with varying amounts of dedicated bus lanes on the western portion. Four potential SL6 routes were identified: Everett (Glendale Square)–Kendall via McGrath Highway, Everett–Kendall via the Gilmore Bridge, Everett–Haymarket via Rutherford Avenue, and Eastern Avenue–Kendall via Everett Square. All of the potential SL6 routes would operate primarily in dedicated lanes. A SL3 extension to Sullivan was announced as the preferred alternative in March 2024; the study recommended that SL6 planning be deferred pending related planning efforts for Sullivan Square, Rutherford Avenue, the Gilmore Bridge, and Kendall Square, as well as implementation of the planned bus network redesign.

The proposed SL3 extension would run in an off-street busway west to 2nd Street, mixed traffic (possibly later dedicated lanes) on 2nd Street and Spring Street, and dedicated lanes on Chelsea Street and most of Broadway. South of Sweetser Circle, a dedicated busway would be built on Lower Broadway. New stops would be located on 2nd Street at Boston Street and Spring Street; on Broadway at Chelsea Street (Everett Square), Beacham Street, and Horizon Way; and at Sullivan Square station. The extension would add of round trip distance, with – 80% – in dedicated bus lanes. It was estimated to increase SL3 ridership by 15,000 daily boardings by 2040, with a capital cost of $95 million. In June 2024, the MBTA was awarded a $22.4 million federal grant for reconstruction of the Lower Broadway segment for existing bus routes and eventual Silver Line service.

===Other proposed corridors===

Several other bus rapid transit and express bus projects have been proposed in Boston, many under the Silver Line banner. The first two phases of the 2010-cancelled Urban Ring Project were to be BRT, with light or heavy rail for the final phase. The Urban Ring was considered a separate project, although it would have shared the SL1 route between Silver Line Way and Logan Airport.

A number of Silver Line expansion corridors were considered in the 2003 Program for Mass Transportation (PMT); most were given brief consideration but not acted upon. One, a BRT express overlay for the route 28 bus (which runs between Ruggles station and Mattapan via Nubian), was revived in 2006 as part of the Phase III plans. In 2009, the state proposed to replace the 28 bus entirely with a BRT route called 28X, including the installation of dedicated bus lanes, bus signal priority, and on-platform fare collection. However, the proposal was withdrawn in 2010 due to local opposition, both to the design of the route and because the plan had been made without consulting local officials. Subsequent planning for bus improvements on Blue Hill Avenue has occurred without Silver Line branding.

Several other corridors were considered in the 2003 PMT. These included a Dudley–Ashmont route replacing the route 23 bus (also revived in 2006 in Phase III planning, but not during the 28X proposal), as well as a new BRT tunnel to Kenmore with surface branches to the Longwood Medical Area via Brookline Avenue and Allston via Commonwealth Avenue, the Mass Pike, and Cambridge Street. The City of Boston proposed an alternate western Silver Line branch using buses along the Mass Pike without a new tunnel, similar to existing express buses.

The 2003 PMT included the possibility of converting the Washington Street section of the Silver Line to light rail (as had originally been promised) using the abandoned southern section of the Tremont Street Subway. The project was estimated to cost $374 million; ridership was estimated to be 34,000 daily riders almost entirely diverted from the Silver Line service. The project was given low priority, with the Phase III tunnel recommended instead. In 2012, the Roxbury–Dorchester–Mattapan Transit Needs Study recommended the conversion to light rail as a long-term project, with the additional possibility of extending the line down Blue Hill Avenue to Mattapan along the route 28 bus corridor.

==Service==

===Frequency and ridership===

The Silver Line routes are among the most frequent MBTA bus routes. All routes (except for the SLW shuttle) run at least every 15 minutes during all service hours, save for late evening and weekend service on the SL4. At peak hours, combined frequency on the trunk sections is about 30 buses per hour (2 minute headways) in each direction in the Transitway, and 12 buses per hour (5 minute headways) on Washington Street. The routes have high ridership (though lower than many key bus routes) and low costs per rider compared to other bus routes in the MBTA system. In 2012, three routes (SL1, SL5, SLW) were the only MBTA bus routes to show a profit; the median net cost (after fares) on all MBTA bus routes was $2.13 per passenger. In 2023, combined weekday ridership on Silver Line routes was 27,000.

In addition to the public route name, the Silver Line and crosstown routes have internal route numbers in the 700 series. The SL5 is designated 749 after the 49 bus it replaced, while the other routes have similar numbers.

===Criticism===
====Mode choice====
When the Washington Street Elevated was replaced with the Southwest Corridor, MBTA promised &quot;equal or better&quot; surface transit on Washington Street to replace the Elevated. Riders supported light rail; the decision to instead run buses was viewed as a broken promise and intentional disinvestment. The Silver Line is substantially slower than the Elevated, with travel time from Nubian Square to Downtown Boston increased from 8 minutes to 20 minutes. The Washington Street corridor population is poorer and less educated than the Southwest Corridor, and has a larger Black population; advocates including state representative Gloria Fox have called the poor service on the Silver Line &quot;discrimination against people of color&quot;. Because of the poor service and the perception that the bus service was an inferior substitute for the originally-planned light rail line, advocates nicknamed the Washington Street service as the &quot;Silver Lie&quot;.

Two theoretical advantages of BRT compared to light rail are low cost and speedy implementation. However, Silver Line service did not begin on Washington Street until 15 years after the Elevated came down; the first phase of the Transitway opened 15 years after the DEIR, and the second phase was never completed. The Transitway was built at &quot;enormous cost&quot;; it was the most expensive single BRT project in the world by a 2007 report. Like the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel (which was later converted to light rail), the Transitway had comparable construction cost to light rail, but a lower level of service. At the time of its cancellation, Phase III was expected to cost $2.1 billion - more than three times that of the Transitway. Although transit ridership in the Seaport doubled after the introduction of the Silver Line, that growth is due partially to commercial development rather than the service quality.

====BRT quality====
Key features of bus rapid transit include dedicated lanes, frequent service, off-vehicle fare collection, sheltered stations, and intelligent transportation systems features such as transit signal priority. A 2011 study by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) determined that the Silver Line was best classified as &quot;Not BRT&quot; because it lacked many of these BRT Standard features.

Off-board fare collection is only present at the three underground stops. A significant portion of delays on the surface sections are caused by long dwell times, as passengers only board through the front door to pay at the single farebox. On June 6, 2012, Massport began funding a three-month pilot of free fares from the five Logan Airport stops as an effort to decrease traffic congestion at the airport terminals. Within the first month, average dwell time dropped by 20 seconds per stop. Massport later extended the pilot until January 2013, then made free fares from Logan permanent. Stops on the Washington Street routes with more than fifteen passengers have an average dwell time of over one minute, which affects both running time and reliability. A two-week pilot program in 2017 tested all-door boarding on these routes, with free fares funded by a nonprofit. The pilot halved dwell times at busy stops, reduced overall average dwell time from 24 to 19 seconds, and increased reliability. All-door boarding will be permanently implemented on all routes in the 2020s as part of the AFC 2.0 fare system.

The Washington Street routes have dedicated bus lanes between and , as well as on Essex Street. However, these lanes are not physically separated from general traffic lanes and are designated as right-turn lanes at many intersections. A lack of loading zones causes many vehicles to double-park in the bus lanes, and violations of the exclusive lanes are rarely prosecuted. In the most congested parts of the corridor – Nubian Square and Downtown Crossing – no dedicated lanes are present. Transit signal priority (TSP) was only planned for four locations on Washington Street. Due to conflicts between the MBTA, the contractors, and the city, the TSP equipment was not activated until 2006. Due to the lack of BRT elements, running times on the corridor show significant variability. Peak-hour times were as much as 1.7 times that of uncontested periods in 2006, indicating that the limited BRT elements on Washington Street were ineffective at actually speeding travel during congested periods. Headway reliability is poor, largely due to operators failing to depart Nubian on time. Additional enforced downtown bus lanes, plus traffic restrictions on Temple Place and new loading zones in Chinatown, were added by the city in 2020.

Although the Transitway is a dedicated bus tunnel without interference from automobile traffic, Waterfront service is no faster than the on-street buses it replaced. The tunnel was built for a maximum speed of ; the narrow lanes without guided buses limit actual speeds to . Water leakage and poor drainage has damaged the concrete floor of the tunnel, leading to &quot;poor ride quality&quot;. The switch between electric and diesel power at Silver Line Way also represents a &quot;significant delay&quot;. Because the original Transitway design ended at D Street, buses must cross the street at a traffic light. A 2003 study indicated extending the Transitway tunnel under D Street (&quot;T under D&quot;) for grade separation was feasible, with a cost around $75 million. The light has attracted criticism from riders due to the delays it causes. A 2013 study found a median delay of 1.5 minutes per round trip at the light. In early 2016, the Boston Transportation Department modified the traffic light to use a fixed cycle, rather than relying on the detection of buses (only done during part of the cycle) to give a green light for the Transitway. However, the BTD&#x27;s modifications did not modify the unusually-long 100-second cycle length nor actively prioritize buses, leading to criticism from transportation planners that the solution was inadequate. Proposed air rights development over the station is required not to preclude later grade separation of D Street. A gate and movable bollard near the light, which are used to prevent private vehicles from entering the Transitway, also cause delays to buses.

Although stop spacing varies widely between BRT systems, distances from to are typically recommended. Even after dropping half the stops, the Washington Street corridor averages only between stops, with several stop spacings as low as . The Washington Street stops were built with open canopies; protected shelters were not added until 2010. A small traditional glass shelter is available at Temple Place; Boylston, Chinatown, and Tufts Medical Center have no shelters at all. Silver Line Way and the SL2 surface stops have glass shelters or none at all; the SL3 surface stops have canopies without shelters.
====Indirect routing====

Because the Transitway was not originally designed for service to Logan Airport or Chelsea, it does not have a direct connection to the Ted Williams Tunnel. Outbound SL1 and SL3 buses must travel west on Haul Road from Silver Line Way to access an eastbound ramp west of B Street, then travel east on a frequently-congested section of I-90. Inbound buses must exit I-90 at B Street and travel east on Congress Street to reach Silver Line Way. An eastbound entrance ramp near Silver Line Way, normally restricted for use by Massachusetts State Police vehicles and MassDOT maintenance vehicles from an adjacent operations center, can shorten the outbound routing by about . MassDOT claims the ramp was not designed for buses, though Big Dig planner Fred Salvucci has claimed it was. Outbound buses were temporarily allowed to use the ramp in 2006 after the Big Dig ceiling collapse, when there was no regular eastbound traffic through the tunnel. The Urban Ring was also proposed to use the ramp. A 2010 study indicated that the ramp was safe for use by the Silver Line.

Transit advocates have since pushed to allow use of the ramp by Silver Line buses (&quot;Free the ramp&quot;), though MassDOT claims the ramp is not safe to use when highway traffic is freely flowing. The MBTA hired a consultant in 2018 to study potential use of the ramp. In May 2019, MassDOT agreed to a limited test of ramp use, though advocates criticized MassDOT for limiting the test to only the evening peak hour, and only when highway speeds did not exceed . The three-day test in August 2019 resulting in average time savings of 3–8 minutes per bus, with significantly larger time savings at the most congested times. After these results, MassDOT agreed to make modifications to the ramp entrance to eventually allow use of the ramp whenever traffic speeds are below 30 mph.

Silver Line buses were again allowed to use the ramp during a 2023 closure of the Sumner Tunnel.

====Other issues====
The SL3 route is subject to frequent delays due to the opening of the Chelsea Street Bridge – as many as ten times per day – for ships serving the upstream oil terminals. Each bridge opening causes a delay of up to 20 minutes, and the only alternate route involves a lengthy detour on Route 1A. Federal regulations give priority to marine traffic. In December 2018, MassDOT officials sought to create a six-month pilot program to reduce peak-hour openings of the bridge, as well as the nearby Meridian Street Bridge used by the busy and bus routes.

The CNG buses bought for the Washington Street service caused disruptive 35 Hz vibrations in nearby residential buildings. It took a year to retrofit the fleet with new mufflers; during that time, older buses which did not have that problem were used at night.

<text>Giles Samuel Bertram Romilly (19 September 1916 – 2 August 1967) was a British communist journalist, Second World War POW, brother of Esmond Romilly, and nephew of Winston Churchill through his wife Clementine Churchill.

== Biography ==
Romilly was educated at Wellington College and Oxford University, and then served as a war correspondent in both the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War. He was captured in May 1940 in the Norwegian town of Narvik while reporting for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

Romilly was the first German prisoner to be classified as &quot;Prominente&quot;, prisoners regarded by Adolf Hitler to be of great value due to their relationships to prominent Allied political figures. Because of his importance to Hitler, Romilly was imprisoned in Oflag IV-C (Colditz Castle), from where escape was perceived to be almost impossible. Romilly lived in relative comfort with the other &quot;Prominente&quot; who would later join him at Colditz, although they were all watched 24 hours a day in case they should attempt to escape.

Romilly used this position to his advantage and caused trouble by issuing complaints for every conceivable annoyance. Amongst the list, he took offence to the noise created by the boots of his guard outside his door, preventing him from sleeping. Following a visit from the Red Cross, a red carpet was placed outside his door to dull the sound.

Romilly did successfully escape however, whilst the &quot;Prominente&quot; were being moved to &quot;Oflag VII-D&quot; Tittmoning Castle in April 1945. The camp was home to some Dutch officers amongst whom was captain Machiel van den Heuvel, &quot;Vandy&quot;. Romilly and Vandy knew each other from their time at Colditz, where Vandy was the Dutch escape officer. Vandy was transferred to Tittmoning because of his leading role as an escape officer, and the Germans thought he could do no more harm in Tittmoning, where most prisoners were older officers of general rank. Vandy, however had his next escape plan ready, and together with two Dutch officers, Romilly abseiled down the castle walls. The rest of the Prominente tried to hide in the castle to make it look like they had all escaped. After four days, they were all discovered. Even though 3,000 people were looking for Romilly, he was able to reach the Allied lines.

This was due mainly to the gallant action of lieutenant Andre Tieleman, a Dutch officer who was fluent in German and French. With their false identity papers identifying them as French (forced) labourers they managed to escape. When interrogated by German officials, Lt Tieleman did the talking while Romilly pretended to be deaf and dumb. In this way they managed to escape into freedom.

After the war Romilly returned to journalism. In 1952 he wrote the memoir &quot;The Privileged Nightmare&quot;, later reissued as &quot;Hostages at Colditz&quot;, with fellow &quot;Prominente&quot; Michael Alexander, who had earned the status by falsely claiming to be a relative of Field Marshal Harold Alexander. Romilly died in Berkeley, California in 1967 of a tranquilliser overdose. His wife Coral Romilly also ingested the sedatives but survived. He was in the process of researching a book on the American novel at the time.

The Battle of Moscow was a military campaign that consisted of two periods of strategically significant fighting on a sector of the Eastern Front during World War II, between October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defensive effort frustrated Hitler&#x27;s attack on Moscow, the capital and largest city of the Soviet Union. Moscow was one of the primary military and political objectives for Axis forces in their invasion of the Soviet Union.

The German Strategic Offensive, named Operation Typhoon, called for two pincer offensives, one to the north of Moscow against the Kalinin Front by the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies, simultaneously severing the Moscow–Leningrad railway, and another to the south of Moscow Oblast against the Western Front south of Tula, by the 2nd Panzer Army, while the 4th Army advanced directly towards Moscow from the west.

Initially, the Soviet forces conducted a strategic defence of the Moscow Oblast by constructing three defensive belts, deploying newly raised reserve armies, and bringing troops from the Siberian and Far Eastern Military Districts. As the German offensives were halted, a Soviet strategic counter-offensive and smaller-scale offensive operations forced the German armies back to the positions around the cities of Oryol, Vyazma and Vitebsk, and nearly surrounded three German armies. It was a major setback for the Germans, and the end of their belief in a swift German victory over the USSR. As a result of the failed offensive, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch was dismissed as supreme commander of the German Army on 19 December, with Hitler replacing him in the position.

==Background==
Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion plan, called for the capture of Moscow within four months. On 22 June 1941, Axis forces invaded the Soviet Union, destroyed most of the Soviet Air Force (VVS) on the ground, and advanced deep into Soviet territory using &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; tactics to destroy entire Soviet armies. The German Army Group North moved towards Leningrad, Army Group South took control of Ukraine, and Army Group Centre advanced towards Moscow. By July 1941, Army Group Centre crossed the Dnieper River, on the path to Moscow.

On 16 July 1941, German forces captured Smolensk, an important stronghold on the road to Moscow.
At this stage, although Moscow was vulnerable, an offensive against the city would have exposed the German flanks. In part to address these risks, and to attempt to secure Ukraine&#x27;s food and mineral resources, Hitler ordered the attack to turn north and south to eliminate Soviet forces at Leningrad and Kiev. This delayed the German advance on Moscow. When that advance resumed on 30 September 1941, German forces had been weakened, while the Soviets had raised new forces for the defence of the city.

==Initial German advance (30 September – 10 October)==

===Plans===


For Hitler, the Soviet capital was secondary, and he believed the only way to bring the Soviet Union to its knees was to defeat it economically. He felt this could be accomplished by seizing the economic resources of Ukraine east of Kiev. When Walther von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, supported a direct thrust to Moscow, he was told that &quot;only ossified brains could think of such an idea&quot;. Franz Halder, head of the Army General Staff, was also convinced that a drive to seize Moscow would be victorious after the German Army inflicted enough damage on the Soviet forces. This view was shared by most within the German high command. But Hitler overruled his generals in favor of pocketing the Soviet forces around Kiev in the south, followed by the seizure of Ukraine. The move was successful, resulting in the loss of nearly 700,000 Red Army personnel killed, captured, or wounded by 26 September, and further advances by Axis forces.

With the end of summer, Hitler redirected his attention to Moscow and assigned Army Group Centre to this task. The forces committed to Operation Typhoon included three infantry armies (the 2nd, 4th, and 9th) supported by three &quot;Panzer&quot; (tank) Groups (the 2nd, 3rd and 4th) and by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2. Up to two million German troops were committed to the operation, along with 1,000–2,470 tanks and assault guns and 14,000 guns. German aerial strength, however, had been severely reduced over the summer&#x27;s campaign; the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had lost 1,603 aircraft and 1,028 had been damaged. &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2 had only 549 serviceable machines, including 158 medium and dive-bombers and 172 fighters, available for Operation Typhoon. The attack relied on standard &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; tactics, using &quot;Panzer&quot; groups rushing deep into Soviet formations and executing double-pincer movements, pocketing Red Army divisions and destroying them.

Facing the Wehrmacht were three Soviet fronts forming a defensive line based on the cities of Vyazma and Bryansk, which barred the way to Moscow. The armies comprising these fronts had also been involved in heavy fighting. Still, it was a formidable concentration consisting of 1,250,000 men, 1,000 tanks and 7,600 guns. The Soviet Air Force had suffered appalling losses of some 7,500 to 21,200 aircraft. Extraordinary industrial achievements had begun to replace these, and at the outset of Typhoon the VVS could muster 936 aircraft, 578 of which were bombers.

Once Soviet resistance along the Vyazma-Bryansk front was eliminated, German forces were to press east, encircling Moscow by outflanking it from the north and south. Continuous fighting had reduced their effectiveness, and logistical difficulties became more acute. General Heinz Guderian, commander of the 2nd Panzer Army, wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and there were fuel shortages at the start of the operation.

===Battles of Vyazma and Bryansk===

The German attack went according to plan, with 4th Panzer Group pushing through the middle nearly unopposed and then dividing its mobile forces north to complete the encirclement of Vyazma with 3rd Panzer Group, and other units south to close the ring around Bryansk in conjunction with 2nd Panzer Group. The Soviet defenses, still under construction, were overrun, and spearheads of the 3rd and 4th Panzer Groups met at Vyazma on 10 October 1941. Four Soviet armies (the 16th, 19th, 20th, 24th and part of the 32nd) were encircled in a large pocket just west of the city.

The encircled Soviet forces continued to fight, and the Wehrmacht had to employ 28 divisions to eliminate them, using troops which could have supported the offensive towards Moscow. The remnants of the Soviet Western and Reserve Fronts retreated and manned new defensive lines around Mozhaisk. Although losses were high, some of the encircled units escaped in small groups, ranging in size from platoons to full rifle divisions. Soviet resistance near Vyazma also provided time for the Soviet high command to reinforce the four armies defending Moscow (the 5th, 16th, 43rd and 49th Armies). Three rifle and two tank divisions were transferred from East Siberia with more to follow.

The weather began to change, hampering both sides. On 7 October, the first snow fell and quickly melted, turning roads and open areas into muddy quagmires, a phenomenon known as &quot;rasputitsa&quot; in Russia. German armored groups were greatly slowed, allowing Soviet forces to fall back and regroup.

Soviet forces were able to counterattack in some cases. For example, on 6 October the 4th Panzer Division fell into an ambush set by Dmitri Leliushenko&#x27;s hastily formed 1st Guards Special Rifle Corps, including Mikhail Katukov&#x27;s 4th Tank Brigade, near the city of Mtsensk. Newly built T-34 tanks were concealed in the woods as German armor rolled past them; as a scratch team of Soviet infantry contained their advance, Soviet armor attacked from both flanks and savaged the German Panzer IV tanks. For the Wehrmacht, the shock of this defeat was so great that a special investigation was ordered. Guderian and his troops discovered, to their dismay, that the Soviet T-34s were almost impervious to German tank guns. As the general wrote, &quot;Our Panzer IV tanks with their short 75 mm guns could only explode a T-34 by hitting the engine from behind&quot;. Guderian also noted in his memoirs that &quot;the Russians already learned a few things&quot;. In 2012, Niklas Zetterling disputed the notion of a major German reversal at Mtsensk, noting that only a battlegroup from the 4th Panzer Division was engaged while most of the division was fighting elsewhere, that both sides withdrew from the battlefield after the fighting and that the Germans lost only nine tanks; six completely destroyed, and three damaged. For German commanders like Hoepner and Bock, the action was inconsequential; their primary worry was resistance from within the pocket, not outside it.
Other counterattacks further slowed the German offensive. The 2nd Army, which was operating to the north of Guderian&#x27;s forces with the aim of encircling the Bryansk Front, had come under strong Red Army pressure assisted by air support.

According to German assessments of the initial Soviet defeat, 673,000 soldiers had been captured by the Wehrmacht in both the Vyazma and Bryansk pockets, although recent research suggests a lower—but still enormous—figure of 514,000 prisoners, reducing Soviet strength by 41%. Personnel losses of 499,001 (permanent as well as temporary) were calculated by the Soviet command. On 9 October, Otto Dietrich of the German Ministry of Propaganda, quoting Hitler himself, forecast in a press conference the imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler had never had to lie about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet resistance was perhaps hours away. German civilian morale—low since the start of Barbarossa—significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future &quot;Lebensraum&quot; in the east.

However, Red Army resistance had slowed the Wehrmacht. When the Germans arrived within sight of the Mozhaisk line west of Moscow on 10 October, they encountered another defensive barrier manned by new Soviet forces. That same day, Georgy Zhukov, who had been recalled from the Leningrad Front on 6 October, took charge of Moscow&#x27;s defense and the combined Western and Reserve Fronts, with Colonel General Ivan Konev as his deputy. On 12 October, Zhukov ordered the concentration of all available forces on a strengthened Mozhaisk line, a move supported by General Vasilevsky of the General Staff. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; still controlled the sky wherever it appeared, and &quot;Stuka&quot; and bomber groups flew 537 sorties, destroying some 440 vehicles and 150 artillery pieces.
On 15 October, Stalin ordered the evacuation of the Communist Party, the General Staff and various civil government offices from Moscow to Kuibyshev (now Samara), leaving only a limited number of officials behind. The evacuation caused panic among Muscovites. On 16–17 October, much of the civilian population tried to flee, mobbing the available trains and jamming the roads from the city. Despite all this, Stalin publicly remained in the Soviet capital, somewhat calming the fear and pandemonium.

==Mozhaisk defense line (13–30 October)==

By 13 October 1941, the Wehrmacht had reached the Mozhaisk defense line, a hastily constructed set of four lines of fortifications protecting Moscow&#x27;s western approaches which extended from Kalinin towards Volokolamsk and Kaluga. Despite recent reinforcements, only around 90,000 Soviet soldiers manned this line—far too few to stem the German advance. Given the limited resources available, Zhukov decided to concentrate his forces at four critical points: the 16th Army under Lieutenant General Konstantin Rokossovsky guarded Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk was defended by 5th Army under Major General Leonid Govorov, the 43rd Army of Major General Konstantin Golubev defended Maloyaroslavets, and the 49th Army under Lieutenant General Ivan Zakharkin protected Kaluga. The entire Soviet Western Front—nearly destroyed after its encirclement near Vyazma—was being recreated almost from scratch.

Moscow itself was also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and teenagers worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million cubic meters of earth with no mechanical help. Moscow&#x27;s factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory was turned into a submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles. Despite these preparations, the capital was within striking distance of German tanks, with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; mounting large-scale air raids on the city. The air raids caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.
On 13 October 1941 (15 October, according to other sources), the Wehrmacht resumed its offensive. At first, the German forces attempted to bypass Soviet defenses by pushing northeast towards the weakly protected city of Kalinin and south towards Kaluga and Tula, capturing all except Tula by 14 October. Encouraged by these initial successes, the Germans launched a frontal assault against the fortified line, taking Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets on 18 October, Naro-Fominsk on 21 October, and Volokolamsk on 27 October after intense fighting. Because of the increasing danger of flanking attacks, Zhukov was forced to fall back, withdrawing his forces east of the Nara river.

In the south, the Second Panzer Army initially advanced towards Tula with relative ease because the Mozhaisk defense line did not extend that far south and no significant concentrations of Soviet troops blocked their advance. However, bad weather, fuel problems, and damaged roads and bridges eventually slowed the German army, and Guderian did not reach the outskirts of Tula until 26 October. The German plan initially called for the rapid capture of Tula, followed by a pincer move around Moscow. The first attack, however, was repelled by the 50th Army and civilian volunteers on 29 October, after a fight within sight of the city. This was followed by the counter-offensive by the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps whose flanks were secured by the 10th Army, 49th Army and 50th Army who attacked from Tula. On 31 October, the German Army high command ordered a halt to all offensive operations until increasingly severe logistical problems were resolved and the subsided.

==Wehrmacht advance towards Moscow (1 November – 5 December)==

===Wearing down===
By late October, the German forces were worn out, with only a third of their motor vehicles still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender to the idea of a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.

To stiffen the resolve of the Red Army and boost civilian morale, Stalin ordered the traditional military parade on 7 November (Revolution Day) to be staged in Red Square. Soviet troops paraded past the Kremlin and then marched directly to the front. The parade carried a great symbolic significance by demonstrating the continued Soviet resolve, and was frequently invoked as such in the years to come. Despite this brave show, the Red Army&#x27;s position remained precarious. Although 100,000 additional Soviet soldiers had reinforced Klin and Tula, where renewed German offensives were expected, Soviet defenses remained relatively thin. Nevertheless, Stalin ordered several preemptive counteroffensives against German lines. These were launched despite protests from Zhukov, who pointed out the complete lack of reserves. The Wehrmacht repelled most of these counteroffensives, which squandered Soviet forces that could have been used for Moscow&#x27;s defense. The only notable success of the offensive occurred west of Moscow near Aleksino, where Soviet tanks inflicted heavy losses on the 4th Army because the Germans still lacked anti-tank weapons capable of damaging the new, well-armoured T-34 tanks.

From 31 October to 13–15 November, the Wehrmacht high command stood down while preparing to launch a second offensive towards Moscow. Although Army Group Centre still possessed considerable nominal strength, its fighting capabilities had been vitiated by wear and fatigue. While the Germans were aware of the continuous influx of Soviet reinforcements from the east as well as the presence of large reserves, given the tremendous Soviet casualties, they did not expect the Soviets to be able to mount a determined defense. But in comparison to the situation in October, Soviet rifle divisions occupied a much stronger defensive position: a triple defensive ring surrounding the city and some remnants of the Mozhaisk line near Klin. Most of the Soviet field armies now had a multilayered defense, with at least two rifle divisions in second echelon positions. Artillery support and sapper teams were also concentrated along major roads that German troops were expected to use in their attacks. There were also many Soviet troops still available in reserve armies behind the front. Finally, Soviet troops—and especially officers—were now more experienced and better prepared for the offensive.

By 15 November 1941, the ground had finally frozen, solving the mud problem. The armored Wehrmacht spearheads, consisting of 51 divisions, could now advance, with the goal of encircling Moscow and linking up near the city of Noginsk, east of the capital. To achieve this objective, the German Third and Fourth Panzer Groups needed to concentrate their forces between the Volga Reservoir and Mozhaysk, then proceed past the Soviet 30th Army to Klin and Solnechnogorsk, encircling the capital from the north. In the south, the Second Panzer Army intended to bypass Tula, still held by the Red Army, and advance to Kashira and Kolomna, linking up with the northern pincer at Noginsk. The German 4th Field Army in the centre were to &quot;pin down the troops of the Western Front.&quot;

===Failed pincer===
On 15 November 1941, German tank armies began their offensive towards Klin, where no Soviet reserves were available because of Stalin&#x27;s wish to attempt a counteroffensive at Volokolamsk, which had forced the relocation of all available reserve forces further south. Initial German attacks split the front in two, separating the 16th Army from the 30th. Several days of intense combat followed. Zhukov recalled in his memoirs that &quot;The enemy, ignoring the casualties, was making frontal assaults, willing to get to Moscow by any means necessary&quot;. Despite the Wehrmacht&#x27;s efforts, the multi-layered defense reduced Soviet casualties as the Soviet 16th Army slowly retreated and constantly harassed the German divisions which were trying to make their way through the fortifications.

The Third Panzer Army captured Klin after heavy fighting on 23 November, Solnechnogorsk as well by 24 November and Istra, by 24/25 November. Soviet resistance was still strong, and the outcome of the battle was by no means certain. Reportedly, Stalin asked Zhukov whether Moscow could be successfully defended and ordered him to &quot;speak honestly, like a communist&quot;. Zhukov replied that it was possible, but reserves were urgently needed. By 27 November, the German 7th Panzer Division had seized a bridgehead across the Moscow-Volga Canal—the last major obstacle before Moscow—and stood less than from the Kremlin; but a powerful counterattack by the 1st Shock Army drove them back. Just northwest of Moscow, the Wehrmacht reached Krasnaya Polyana, little more than 29 km (18 mi) from the Kremlin in central Moscow; German officers were able to make out some of the major buildings of the Soviet capital through their field glasses. Both Soviet and German forces were severely depleted, sometimes having only 150–200 riflemen—a company&#x27;s full strength—left in a regiment.

In the south, near Tula, combat resumed on 18 November 1941, with the Second Panzer Army trying to encircle the city. The German forces involved were extremely battered from previous fighting and still had no winter clothing. As a result, initial German progress was only per day. Moreover, it exposed the German tank armies to flanking attacks from the Soviet 49th and 50th Armies, located near Tula, further slowing the advance. Guderian nevertheless was able to pursue the offensive, spreading his forces in a star-like attack, taking Stalinogorsk on 22 November 1941 and surrounding a Soviet rifle division stationed there.

On 25 November 1941, the German 2nd Panzer Army under Guderian began advancing towards Kashira that lay 120 kilometres south-southeast of Moscow and 80 kilometres north-northeast of Tula. Kashira was of paramount importance, considering that it was the headquarters of the Soviet Western Front, one of the three main groups of resistance against the Nazi storm. The Germans were capable of seizing Venev and pushing towards storming formidably towards Kashira. Should Kashira fall, the road to Moscow would be open for the 2nd Panzer Group. In an attempt to halt the onslaught of the 2nd Panzer Group, the STAVKA High Command hurled Major General Pavel Belov&#x27;s 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, General Andrei Getman&#x27;s 112th Tank Division, an armoured brigade and a battalion of BM-13 Katyusha rocket launchers along with support from the air force against the Wehrmacht. The cavalrymen of the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, which was primarily armed with the SVT-40 semi-automatic battle rifle and Cossack shashkas, as well as the mechanized troops possessing T-34 and KV-1 tanks, battled relentlessly against Heinz Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Group. After much vicious fighting, the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps was able to repel the armoured forces of Guderian and subsequently drove them back by 40 kilometres to the town of Mordves.

The Germans were driven back in early December, securing the southern approach to the city. Tula itself held, protected by fortifications and determined defenders mostly from the 50th Army, made of both soldiers and civilians. In the south, the Wehrmacht never got close to the capital. The first stroke of the Western-Front&#x27;s counter-offensive on the outskirts of Moscow fell upon Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Army.

Because of the resistance on both the northern and southern sides of Moscow, on 1 December the Wehrmacht attempted a direct offensive from the west along the Minsk-Moscow highway near the city of Naro-Fominsk. This offensive had limited tank support and was directed against extensive Soviet defenses. After meeting determined resistance from the Soviet 1st Guards Motorized Rifle Division and flank counterattacks staged by the 33rd Army, the German offensive stalled and was driven back four days later in the ensuing Soviet counteroffensive. On the same day, the French-manned 638th Infantry Regiment, the only foreign formation of the Wehrmacht that took part in the advance on Moscow, went into action near the village of Diutkovo. On 2 December, a reconnaissance battalion came to the town of Khimki—some away from the Kremlin in central Moscow reaching its bridge over the Moscow-Volga Canal as well as its railway station. This marked the closest approach of German forces to Moscow.

The European Winter of 1941–42 was the coldest of the twentieth century. On 30 November, General Fedor von Bock claimed in a report to Berlin that the temperature was −45 °C (−49 °F). General Erhard Raus, commander of the 6th Panzer Division, kept track of the daily mean temperature in his war diary. It shows a suddenly much colder period during 4–7 December: from −36 to −38 °C (−37 to −38 °F), although the method or reliability of his measurements is not known. Other temperature reports varied widely. Zhukov said that November&#x27;s freezing weather stayed only around −7 to −10 °C (+19 to +14 °F). Official Soviet Meteorological Service records show that at the lowest point, the lowest December temperature reached −28.8 °C (−20 °F). These numbers indicated severely cold conditions, and German troops were freezing with no winter clothing, using equipment that was not designed for such low temperatures. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease had to be removed from every loaded shell and vehicles had to be heated for hours before use. The same cold weather hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared. German clothing was supplemented by Soviet clothing and boots, which were often in better condition than German clothes as the owners had spent much less time at the front. Corpses were thawed out to remove the items; once when 200 bodies were left on the battlefield the &quot;saw commandos&quot; recovered sufficient clothing to outfit every man in a battalion.

The Axis offensive on Moscow stopped. Guderian wrote in his journal that &quot;the offensive on Moscow failed ... We underestimated the enemy&#x27;s strength, as well as his size and climate. Fortunately, I stopped my troops on 5 December, otherwise the catastrophe would be unavoidable.&quot;

Some historians have suggested that artificial floods played an important role in defending Moscow. They were primarily meant to break the ice and prevent troops and heavy military equipment from crossing the Volga river and Ivankovo Reservoir. This began with the blowing up of the waterworks reservoir dam on 24 November 1941. On 28 November 1941, the water was drained into the Yakhroma and Sestra Rivers from six reservoirs (, , , , , and reservoirs), as well as from Ivankovo Reservoir using dams near Dubna. This caused some 30–40 villages to become partially submerged even in the severe winter weather conditions of the time. Both were results of Soviet General Headquarters&#x27; Order 0428 dated 17 November 1941. Artificial floods were also used as an unconventional weapon of direct impact.

==Soviet counter-offensive==

Although the Wehrmacht&#x27;s offensive had been stopped, German intelligence estimated that Soviet forces had no more reserves left and thus would be unable to stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East after learning that Imperial Japan had no plans to invade the USSR in the near future from Richard Sorge. The Red Army had accumulated a 58-division reserve by early December, when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin. Even with these new reserves, Soviet forces committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men, only slightly outnumbering the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points.

On 5 December 1941, the counteroffensive for &quot;removing the immediate threat to Moscow&quot; started on the Kalinin Front. The South-Western Front and Western Fronts began their offensives the next day. After several days of little progress, Soviet armies retook Solnechnogorsk on 12 December and Klin on 15 December. Guderian&#x27;s army &quot;beat a hasty retreat towards Venev&quot; and then Sukhinichi. &quot;The threat overhanging Tula was removed&quot;.

On 8 December, Hitler had signed his directive No.39, ordering the Wehrmacht to assume a defensive stance on the whole front. German troops were unable to organize a solid defense at their initial locations and were forced to pull back to consolidate their lines. Guderian wrote that discussions with Hans Schmidt and Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen took place the same day, and both commanders agreed the current front line could not be held. On 14 December, Halder and Günther von Kluge finally gave permission for a limited withdrawal to the west of the Oka river, without Hitler&#x27;s approval. On 20 December, during a meeting with German senior officers, Hitler cancelled the withdrawal and ordered his soldiers to defend every patch of ground, &quot;digging trenches with howitzer shells if needed&quot;. Guderian protested, pointing out that losses from cold were actually greater than combat losses and that winter equipment was held up by traffic ties in Poland. Nevertheless, Hitler insisted on defending the existing lines, and Guderian was dismissed by 25 December, along with generals Hoepner and Strauss, commanders of the 4th Panzer and 9th Army, respectively. Bock was also dismissed, officially for &quot;medical reasons&quot;. Brauchitsch had been removed even earlier, on 19 December.

Meanwhile, the Soviet offensive continued in the north. The offensive liberated Kalinin and the Soviets reached Klin on 7 December, overrunning the headquarters of the LVI &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps outside the city. As the Kalinin Front drove west, a bulge developed around Klin. The Soviet front commander, Konev, attempted to envelop any German forces remaining. Zhukov diverted more forces to the southern end of the bulge, to help Konev trap the 3rd Panzer Army. The Germans pulled their forces out in time. Although the encirclement failed, it unhinged the German defenses. A second attempt was made to outflank Army Group Centre&#x27;s northern forces, but met strong opposition near Rzhev and was forced to halt, forming a salient that would last until March 1943. In the south, the offensive went equally well, with Southwestern Front forces relieving Tula on 16 December 1941. A major achievement was the encirclement and destruction of the German XXXV Corps, protecting Guderian&#x27;s Second Panzer Army&#x27;s southern flank.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was paralysed in the second half of December. The weather, recorded as –42 °C (–44 °F) though not officially substantiated, was a meteorological record. Logistical difficulties and freezing temperatures created technical difficulties until January 1942. In the meantime, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had virtually vanished from the skies over Moscow, while the Red Air Force, operating from better prepared bases and benefiting from interior lines, grew stronger. On 4 January, the skies cleared. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was quickly reinforced, as Hitler hoped it would save the situation. The &quot;Kampfgruppen&quot; (Bomber Groups) II./KG 4 and II./KG 30 arrived from refitting in Germany, whilst four &quot;Transportgruppen&quot; (Transport Groups) with a strength of 102 Junkers Ju 52 transports were deployed from &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; (Air Fleet 4) to evacuate surrounded army units and improve the supply line to the front-line forces. It was a last minute effort and it worked. The German air arm was to help prevent a total collapse of Army Group Centre. Despite the Soviets&#x27; best efforts, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had contributed enormously to the survival of Army Group Centre. Between 17 and 22 December the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; destroyed 299 motor vehicles and 23 tanks around Tula, hampering the Red Army&#x27;s pursuit of the German Army.

In the centre, Soviet progress was much slower. Soviet troops liberated Naro-Fominsk only on 26 December, Kaluga on 28 December, and Maloyaroslavets on 2 January, after ten days of violent action. Soviet reserves ran low, and the offensive halted on 7 January 1942, after having pushed the exhausted and freezing German armies back from Moscow. Stalin continued to order more offensives in order to trap and destroy Army Group Centre in front of Moscow, but the Red Army was exhausted and overstretched and they failed. In any case, the outcome of this battle put an end to Hitler&#x27;s hope of a fast victory.

==Aftermath==

Furious that his army had been unable to take Moscow, Hitler dismissed Brauchitsch on 19 December 1941, and took personal charge of the Wehrmacht, effectively taking control of all military decisions. Hitler surrounded himself with staff officers with little or no recent combat experience.

The Red Army&#x27;s winter counter-offensive drove the Wehrmacht from Moscow, but the city was still considered to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin.

On 5 January 1942, during a meeting in the Kremlin, Stalin announced that he was planning a general spring offensive, which would be staged simultaneously near Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, and the Crimea. This plan was accepted over Zhukov&#x27;s objections.

A documentary film, &quot;Moscow Strikes Back&quot;, (, &quot;Rout of the German Troops near Moscow&quot;), was made during the battle and rapidly released in the Soviet Union. It was taken to America and shown at the Globe in New York in August 1942. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer commented that &quot;The savagery of that retreat is a spectacle to stun the mind&quot;. As well as the Moscow parade and battle scenes, the film included images of German atrocities committed during the occupation, &quot;the naked and slaughtered children stretched out in ghastly rows, the youths dangling limply in the cold from gallows that were rickety, but strong enough&quot;.

==Legacy==

The defense of Moscow became a symbol of Soviet resistance against the invading Axis forces. To commemorate the battle, Moscow was awarded the title of &quot;Hero City&quot; in 1965, on the 20th anniversary of Victory Day. A Museum of the Defence of Moscow was created in 1995.

In Moscow, an annual military parade on Red Square on 7 November is held in honor of the October Revolution Parade and as a substitute for the October Revolution celebrations that have not been celebrated on a national level since 1995. The parade is held to commemorate the historical event as a Day of Military Honour. The parade includes troops of the Moscow Garrison and the Western Military District, which usually numbers to close to 3,000 soldiers, cadets, and Red Army reenactors. The parade is presided by the Mayor of Moscow who delivers a speech during the event. Prior to the start of the parade, an historical reenactment of the Battle of Moscow is performed by young students, volunteers, and historical enthusiasts.

The parade commands are always given by a high ranking veteran of the armed forces (usually with a billet of a Colonel) who gives the orders for the march past from the grandstand near the Lenin Mausoleum. On the command of &quot;Quick March!&quot; by the parade commander, the parade begins with the tune of &quot;Song of the Soviet Army&quot;, to which the historical color guards holding wartime symbols such as the Banner of Victory and the standards of the various military fronts march to. Musical support during the parade is always provided by the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, which includes various military bands in the Western Military District, The Regimental Band of the 154th Preobrazhensky Regiment, and the Central Military Band of the Ministry of Defense of Russia.

==Casualties==
Both German and Soviet casualties during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Not all historians agree on what should be considered the &quot;Battle of Moscow&quot; in the timeline of World War II. While the start of the battle is usually regarded as the beginning of Operation Typhoon on 30 September 1941 (or sometimes on 2 October 1941), there are two different dates for the end of the offensive. In particular, some sources (such as Erickson and Glantz) exclude the Rzhev offensive from the scope of the battle, considering it as a distinct operation and making the Moscow offensive &quot;stop&quot; on 7 January 1942—thus lowering the number of casualties.

There are also significant differences in figures from various sources. John Erickson, in his &quot;Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies&quot;, gives a figure of 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942. Glantz, in his book &quot;When Titans Clashed&quot;, gives a figure of 658,279 for the defense phase alone, plus 370,955 for the winter counteroffensive until 7 January 1942. The official Wehrmacht daily casualty reports show 35,757 killed in action, 128,716 wounded, and 9,721 missing in action for the entire Army Group Centre between 1 October 1941 and 10 January 1942. However, this official report does not match unofficial reports from individual battalion and divisional officers and commanders at the front, who record suffering far higher casualties than was officially reported.

On the Russian side, discipline became ferocious. The NKVD blocking groups were ready to shoot anyone retreating without orders. NKVD squads went to field hospitals in search of soldiers with self-inflicted injuries, the so-called &#x27;self shooters&#x27; - those who shot themselves in the left hand to escape fighting. A surgeon in a field hospital of the Red Army admitted to amputating the hands of boys who tried this &#x27;self-shooting&#x27; idea to escape fighting, to protect them from immediate execution via punishment squad.

<text>Deadpan, dry humour, or dry-wit humour is the deliberate display of emotional neutrality or no emotion, commonly as a form of comedic delivery to contrast with the ridiculousness or absurdity of the subject matter. The delivery is meant to be blunt, ironic, laconic, or apparently unintentional.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;deadpan&quot; first emerged early in the 20th century, as a compound word (sometimes spelled as two words) combining &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;pan&quot; (a slang term for the face). It appeared in print as early as 1915, in an article about a former baseball player named Gene Woodburn written by his former manager Roger Bresnahan. Bresnahan described how Woodburn used his skill as a ventriloquist to make his manager and others think they were being heckled from the stands. Woodburn, wrote Bresnahan, &quot;had a trick of what the actors call &#x27;the dead pan.&#x27; He never cracked a smile and would be the last man you would suspect was working a trick.&quot;

George M. Cohan, in a 1908 interview, had alluded to dead pans without using the actual term &quot;deadpan&quot;. Cohan, after returning from a trip to London, told an interviewer that &quot;the time is ripe for a manager to take over about a dozen American chorus girls and wake up the musical comedy game. The English chorus girls are dead–their pans are cold.”

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites a 1928 &quot;New York Times&quot; article as having the first appearance of the term in print. That article, a collection of film slang compiled by writer and theatrical agent Frank J. Wilstach, defines &quot;dead pan&quot; as &quot;playing a role with expressionless face, as, for instance, the work of Buster Keaton.&quot; There were several other uses of the term, in theater and in sports, between the 1915 Bresnahan article and the 1928 article in the &quot;Times&quot;.

The usage of deadpan as a verb (&quot;to speak, act, or utter in a deadpan manner; to maintain a dead pan&quot;) is recorded at least as far back as 1942.

==Examples==
The English music hall comedian T. W. Barrett, working in the 1880s and 1890s, is credited with being the first to perform in a deadpan manner, standing completely still and without a smile.

Early in his vaudeville days, Buster Keaton developed his deadpan expression. Keaton realised that audiences responded better to his stony expression than when he smiled, and he carried this style into his silent film career. The 1928 Vitaphone short film &quot;The Beau Brummels&quot;, with vaudeville comics Al Shaw and Sam Lee, was performed entirely in deadpan. The 1980 film &quot;Airplane!&quot; was performed almost entirely in deadpan; it helped relaunch the career of one of its supporting actors, Leslie Nielsen, who transformed into a prolific deadpan comic after the film. Actor and comedian Bill Murray is known for his deadpan delivery.

Many popular American sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humour, including &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, and &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;. More recent examples are Andre Braugher as Captain Raymond Holt from the TV show &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing in &quot;Friends&quot;, Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson and Aubrey Plaza as April Ludgate in &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, Jennette McCurdy as Sam Puckett in &quot;iCarly&quot;, and Louis C.K. in &quot;Louie&quot;. Another example is the comedy of Steven Wright.

Deadpan delivery runs throughout British humour. In television sitcoms, John Cleese as Basil Fawlty in &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; and Rowan Atkinson as Edmund Blackadder in &quot;Blackadder&quot; are both frustrated figures who display little facial expression in their put-downs. Atkinson also plays authority figures (especially priests) while speaking absurd lines with a deadpan delivery. Monty Python include it in their work, such as &quot;The Ministry of Silly Walks&quot; sketch. For his deadpan delivery Peter Sellers received a BAFTA for Best Actor for &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; (1959). A leading figure of the British satire boom of the 1960s, Peter Cook delivered deadpan monologues in his double act with Dudley Moore. In his various roles Ricky Gervais often draws humour from an exasperated sigh. While in his various guises such as Ali G and Borat, the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen interacts with unsuspecting subjects not realising they have been set up for self-revealing ridicule; on this &quot;The Observer&quot; states, &quot;his career has been built on winding people up, while keeping a deadpan face.&quot;

Dry humour is often confused with highbrow or egghead humour, because the humour in dry humour does not exist in the words or delivery. Instead, the listener must look for humour in the contradiction between words, delivery and context. Failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humour unfunny. However, the term &quot;deadpan&quot; itself actually refers only to the method of delivery.

<text>The Crescent is a daily long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak between New York City and New Orleans (the &quot;Crescent City&quot;). The route connects the Northeast to the Gulf Coast via the Appalachian Piedmont, with major stops in Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; and Birmingham, Alabama.

Most of the route of the &quot;Crescent&quot; is on the Norfolk Southern Railway. It is the successor of the Southern Crescent, introduced in 1970 by Norfolk Southern&#x27;s predecessor, the Southern Railway.

==History==
===&quot;Southerner&quot;===

Today&#x27;s &quot;Crescent&quot; is a direct descendant of the &quot;Southerner&quot;, a streamlined passenger train operated by the Southern Railway from 1941 to 1970. The daily train followed essentially the same route as the modern &quot;Crescent&quot;, providing sleeper service between New York and New Orleans via Washington, Atlanta, and Birmingham.

===&quot;Southern Crescent&quot;===
Since its inception, the sister train of the &quot;Southerner&quot; was a second New York–New Orleans sleeper, the Southern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Crescent&quot;. The two trains shared generally the same route between New York and Atlanta, but diverged between Atlanta and New Orleans. The &quot;Crescent&quot; took a more coastal route, operating via Mobile and Montgomery over Atlanta and West Point Railroad, Western Railway of Alabama, and Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad trackage. The &quot;Southerner&quot; stayed inland to run exclusively on Southern Railway trackage through Birmingham.

In 1970, amid a push by its partners to discontinue passenger operations, the Southern Railway merged the &quot;Southerner&quot; and the &quot;Crescent&quot; into one service: the &quot;Southern Crescent.&quot; The new train used the route of the &quot;Southerner,&quot; operating via Birmingham instead of Mobile. Although the Birmingham route was slightly longer, it was fully owned by the Southern Railway and therefore more reliable. The &quot;Southern Crescent&quot; was numbered 1 southbound and 2 northbound. Penn Central carried it between Washington and New York along the Northeast Corridor, inheriting the longstanding haulage agreement from the Pennsylvania Railroad.

For most of the 1970s, the &quot;Southern Crescent&quot; was supplemented by the &quot;Piedmont,&quot; a former New York–New Orleans train that had been cut back to a regional Atlanta–Washington (later Charlotte–Washington and Salisbury–Washington) service running along the middle leg of the &quot;Southern Crescent&quot; route.

Amtrak took over most inter-city passenger trains in the United States on May 1, 1971, but the Southern Railway initially opted out. Amtrak did inherit most of Penn Central&#x27;s passenger services, including the haulage agreement for the &quot;Southern Crescent&quot;. For a portion of the mid-1970s, the &quot;Southern Crescent&quot; only operated tri-weekly between Atlanta and New Orleans, and carried a run-through Amtrak 10-6 sleeper on those days to connect to the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;. On occasion, when the Southern deemed an Amtrak car to be short of its standards, it substituted a Southern sleeper in the consist. Additionally, one of the two dome coaches in the Southern car fleet was added for the leg south of Atlanta.

The &quot;Southern Crescent&quot; was one of the last two privately operated long-distance passenger services in the United States, the other being the &quot;Rio Grande Zephyr&quot;. However, mounting revenue losses and equipment-replacement expenses forced Southern Railway to leave the passenger business. 

===Amtrak era===

The Southern Railway turned over full operation of the &quot;Southern Crescent&quot; to Amtrak on February 1, 1979. Amtrak simplified the name to the &quot;Crescent&quot; and renumbered it 19 southbound and 20 northbound, though for several years the Southern assigned it operating numbers 819 and 820. The train began using rebuilt Heritage Fleet equipment in 1981.
On October 28, 1989, Amtrak added a section of the &quot;Crescent&quot; between Birmingham and Mobile, Alabama, known as the &quot;Gulf Breeze&quot;. It ran until April 1, 1995, when it was cancelled due to budget issues. A replacement Amtrak Thruway bus ran until October 16, 1997. The Atlanta–New Orleans portion of the &quot;Crescent&quot; was reduced to tri-weekly operation from April 2, 1995, to November 11, 1996 (quad-weekly from November 1995 to February 1996).
When Hurricane Katrina struck Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama in August 2005, the &quot;Crescent&quot; was temporarily truncated to Atlanta. Service was restored first as far as Meridian, Mississippi, while Norfolk Southern crews worked to repair the damage to their lines serving the Gulf Coast. Amtrak restored &quot;Crescent&quot; and &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; service to New Orleans on October 9, 2005.

From July 10 to September 1, 2017, the train terminated at Washington, D.C. instead of New York City due to track work at Penn Station. Starting October 1, 2019, traditional dining car services were removed and replaced with a reduced menu of &#x27;Flexible Dining&#x27; options. As a result, the dining car serves as a lounge car for the exclusive use by sleeping car passengers.

===Proposed expansion===

As part of Amtrak&#x27;s Network Growth Strategy (NGS), adding a section from Meridian, Mississippi to Fort Worth, Texas has been discussed since the early 2000s, with the route having supposed to been up and running by 2002. The plan fell through when Amtrak abandoned the NGS. However, in March 2023, Amtrak announced that it is seeking federal funding to once again study this proposal. Due to Kansas City Southern Railway&#x27;s (KCS) continued opposition to hosting this train on the Meridian Speedway, the study was dependent on a proposed merger between the KCS and Canadian Pacific Railway being approved by the United States Surface Transportation Board. This merger was approved on March 15, 2023, and officially went into effect on April 14, 2023, allowing this proposal to move forward. In June 2023, Amtrak applied for funding to begin the project to extend service from Mississippi to Texas along the I-20 corridor.

===Federal lawsuit===
In July 2024 the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Norfolk Southern Railway, alleging that they did not give priority to Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Crescent&quot; on about 1,140 miles of Norfolk Southern-owned tracks as required by federal law. According to the lawsuit and audits conducted by Amtrak, about one out of every four southbound &quot;Crescent&quot; services arrived at their destination on-time in 2023. A spokesman for Norfolk Southern said that delays on the route had been reduced in recent months and that they were &quot;committed to complying with the law, working together, and honoring our commitments.&quot;

==Route==

The tracks used were once part of the Pennsylvania Railroad; Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad; Southern Railway and North Carolina Railroad systems; they are now owned by Amtrak, CSX Transportation, and Norfolk Southern Railway, respectively. The following lines are used:
*New York City to Washington, D.C.: Northeast Corridor, ex-Pennsylvania Railroad, now Amtrak
*Washington to Alexandria, Virginia: Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, now CSX
*Alexandria to Danville, Virginia: Virginia Midland Railway (ex-Southern Railway), now Norfolk Southern
*Danville to Greensboro, North Carolina: Piedmont Air-Line Railway (ex-Southern Railway), now NS
*Greensboro to Charlotte, North Carolina: North Carolina Railroad (formerly leased by Southern Railway), track managed by NS
*Charlotte to Atlanta, Georgia: Atlanta and Charlotte Air-Line Railway (ex-Southern Railway), now NS
*Atlanta to Birmingham, Alabama: Georgia Pacific Railway (ex-Southern Railway), now NS
*Station and adjacent tracks in Birmingham: Louisville and Nashville Railroad, now CSX
* Birmingham to Meridian, Mississippi: Alabama Great Southern Railroad (ex-Southern Railway), now NS
* Meridian to New Orleans, Louisiana: New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad (ex-Southern Railway), now NS
== Rolling stock ==
, a usual consist on the &quot;Crescent&quot; includes:
* 2 GE P42DC or Siemens ALC-42 diesel locomotives (1 Siemens ACS-64 electric locomotive north of Washington, D.C.)
* 3 Amfleet II coaches
* 1 Amfleet II café car
* 2 Viewliner sleeping cars
* 1 Viewliner II baggage-dorm
* 1 Viewliner II diner

Amtrak plans to replace the Amfleet cars with new long-distance cars by 2032.

<doc id="573894" wikidata="Q912850" url="?curid=573894" title="Over the Hills and Far Away (EP)">
<text>Over the Hills and Far Away is the first EP by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, released on 25 June 2001 through Spinefarm Records in Finland, and Drakkar Records in the rest of Europe. It was also released by Toy&#x27;s Factory in Japan and Century Media Records in the US. Bassist Sami Vänskä left the band after its recording, due to musical differences between him and Tuomas Holopainen. He was replaced by the bassist and male vocalist, Marko Hietala.

The editions by Drakkar and Century Media contain different live tracks taken from the live DVD &quot;From Wishes to Eternity&quot;, recorded in Tampere, Finland, on 29 December 2000.

The EP debuted at number one on the Finnish Singles Chart and spent twelve weeks in the top three, topping it for another four weeks and spending six weeks at number two. It charted for a total of 49 weeks, including two weeks in early 2004. The EP has been awarded double-platinum certification in Finland and has sold over 36,000 copies to date, becoming the sixth-best-selling single of all time in Finland. &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; entered also the European charts, in the Top 100 of Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland.

The EP has two new songs and a remake of &quot;Angels Fall First&quot;″s &quot;Astral Romance&quot;, sung by Tony Kakko beside Tarja Turunen. The title song is by Northern Irish singer and guitarist Gary Moore, and has backing vocals by Tuomas Holopainen and Kakko. &quot;It had a bit of a karaoke vibe because the backing track was so similar,&quot; Moore observed. &quot;I don&#x27;t mean that insultingly, but it was almost identical. I believe they&#x27;re a pretty big band now, so it&#x27;s cool that they did it.&quot; Tapio Wilska sings on &quot;10th Man Down&quot;.

<doc id="573898" wikidata="Q5632153" url="?curid=573898" title="HMS Diomede (F16)">
<text>HMS &quot;Diomede&quot; (F16) was a of the Royal Navy. She was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders in Glasgow. &quot;Diomede&quot; was launched on 15 April 1969 and commissioned on 2 April 1971. In 1988, the vessel was taken out of service and sold to Pakistan. Renamed PNS &quot;Shamsheer&quot;, the vessel served with the Pakistan Navy until being scrapped.

==Service history==
===Royal Navy service===
In 1972, &quot;Diomede&quot; took part in the Second Cod War during the fishing dispute with Iceland, though &quot;Diomede&quot;″s involvement was more quiet than her involvement in the subsequent Cod War. Also that year, &quot;Diomede&quot; joined the 3rd Frigate Squadron which was then based in the Far East.

In 1974, &quot;Diomede&quot;, took part in Task Group (TG) 317.2 which was a deployment that caused some controversy back in the UK when the TG, on its way to the Far East/Pacific, visited South Africa, which was at that time under apartheid rule, as well as performing military exercises with the South African armed forces. &quot;Diomede&quot;, along with the nuclear submarine , visited the port of Simonstown while the rest of the TG visited Cape Town. The TG, upon reaching the Far East performed a number of exercises and &#x27;fly the flag&#x27; visits with Far East and Pacific countries. They did not visit South Africa on their return, and headed to Brazil for an exercise with the Brazilian Navy. &quot;Diomede&quot; returned to the UK in June 1975.

The following year, &quot;Diomede&quot; joined the Fishery Protection Squadron, and took part in the Third Cod War. During that conflict, &quot;Diomede&quot; collided three times with Icelandic Coast Guard vessels, once with and three times with , with the last one inflicting a gash on &quot;Diomede&quot;″s port beam, knocking her out of the conflict.

In 1977, &quot;Diomede&quot; took part in the Fleet Review, in honor of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee as part of the 3rd Frigate Squadron. The ship was adopted by the borough of Langbaurgh in North Yorkshire in 1978.

Also in the 1970s, &quot;Diomede&quot; was one of the seven &quot;Leander&quot;s used as the fictional for the BBC TV drama series &quot;Warship&quot;. All members of the crew were given &quot;Hero&quot; cap tallies for filming purposes.

Her modernisation that would have given her Exocet and Sea Wolf was cancelled due to John Nott&#x27;s 1981 Defence Review and she was intended to be placed in the Standby Squadron but the decision was repealed due to the 1982 Falklands War. During that year, &quot;Diomede&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of the Armilla patrol.

In 1985 she deployed again to the West Indies as the &#x27;West Indies Guardship&#x27; accompanying Queen Elizabeth II aboard . The Queen was so impressed by the way her ship&#x27;s company performed their duties, that she ordered &#x27;splice the mainbrace&#x27;.

&quot;Diomede&quot; returned to the South Atlantic in 1987 where she performed a number of patrols in the vicinity of the Falkland Islands as well as visiting the Island of South Georgia.

===Pakistan Navy service===
In 1988, &quot;Diomede&quot; was decommissioned from the Royal Navy and subsequently sold to Pakistan where she was renamed PNS &quot;Shamsheer&quot;. &quot;Shamsheer &quot;continued in service for many years until she was decommissioned by Pakistan Navy in 2003 and scrapped.

<text>Berry Linux is a Live CD Linux distribution that has English and Japanese support. Berry Linux is based on and is compatible with Fedora 39 packages. The distribution is primarily focused on use as a Live CD, but it can also be installed to a live USB drive. Berry Linux can be used to try out and showcase Linux, for educational purposes, or as a rescue system, without the need to make changes to a hard disk. The current version is 1.39 released on 31 May 2024.

== Features ==
Berry includes read/write NTFS support, and AIGLX and Beryl are bundled for 3D desktop effects. Berry also uses bootsplash, giving it a graphical startup.

The full version (v1.12) includes and runs on Linux Kernel 3.0.4. It has the ALSA sound system, ACPI support, and SELinux. Berry Linux features automatic hardware detection, with support for many graphics cards, sound cards, SCSI, USB devices and many other peripherals. Network devices are automatically configured with DHCP.

The full version of Berry Linux uses KDE (Version 4.6.5) while Berry Linux Mini uses the Fluxbox window manager. The full version is 512.7MB, while the mini version is 273.4MB. To test Berry Linux it is not necessary to install the distribution to a hard disk, as the operating system runs entirely from CD-ROM. It is, however, possible to install Berry Linux to a hard disk, which requires 1.7 gigabytes of free space.
Supporting Japanese, Berry includes Whiz, a sharp Kana-Kanji conversion system. It also comes with LibreOffice version 3.4.3, a Microsoft Office compatible office suite, as well as TextMaker/PlanMaker as Berry&#x27;s office software. The GIMP, version 2.6.10, is bundled for graphics software.

<doc id="573903" wikidata="Q3181503" url="?curid=573903" title="Paradise Island">
<text>Paradise Island is an island in the Bahamas formerly known as Hog Island. The island, with an area of (2.8 km2/1.1 sq mi), is located just off the shore of the city of Nassau, which is itself located on the northern edge of the island of New Providence. 

It is best known for the sprawling resort Atlantis with its extensive water park rides, pools, beach, restaurants, walk-in aquarium and casinos.

Paradise Island is connected to the island of New Providence by two bridges that cross Nassau Harbour. The first was built in 1966 by Resorts International, and the second in the late 1990s.

==Recent history==

===Purchase by Huntington Hartford and development as a resort===
Huntington Hartford, the A&amp;P supermarket heir, arrived on Hog Island in 1959. In 1960-1961, Hartford bought Hog Island from Axel Wenner-Gren and changed the name to Paradise Island in 1962. He hired the Palm Beach architect John Volk and built the Ocean Club, Cafe Martinique, Hurricane Hole, the Golf Course, among other island landmarks. He also acquired and installed the Cloisters, a 14th-century French Augustinian monastery originally purchased in Montréjeau and dismantled by William Randolph Hearst in the 1920s. He hired Gary Player to be the golf pro and Pancho Gonzales to be the tennis pro. His opening of Paradise Island in 1962 was covered in &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazines. He hired the staff from Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc to work off season at the Ocean Club. He had the fireworks for the opening party flown in from the South of France. He had a flag and Paradise Beach was featured on Bahamian three-dollar notes in 1966 (introduced as a close equivalent to the Bahamian Pound, which was replaced at the rate of $1 = £7, so $3 = £21).

===Paradise Island Airport===
A small airstrip existed on the island from 1989 to 1999 to serve the resort. Prior to 1989 the airport was a seaplane base with a ramp for aircraft to leave the water. In 1989 a runway was added to the airport.
The airport&#x27;s codes were: IATA: PID ICAO: MYPI. Both Paradise Island Airlines and Chalk&#x27;s International Airlines were the main tenants of the airport. US Airways Express also served the airport from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

The STOL capable de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprop operated by Paradise Island Airlines as well the Grumman G-73 Mallard amphibian aircraft flown by Chalk&#x27;s International Airlines both served the airstrip which closed in 1999. The airfield and runway have since been removed and replaced with an 18-hole luxury golf course surrounded by one of the wealthiest neighbourhoods on the island. The area goes by the name &quot;Ocean Club&quot; with property prices as high as 40 million dollars or more.

===Development as a gambling resort===
Huntington Hartford met James M. Crosby (1927–1986) through Huntington&#x27;s bodyguard Sy Alter. Sy Alter met Jim Crosby at the Colony Club in Palm Beach. Huntington Hartford obtained the gambling licence for Paradise Island and included Jim Crosby as an extra investor. Jim Crosby and Jack Davis then formed a company, Resorts International, to continue developing Paradise Island. 

Paradise Island was purchased in the 1980s for $79 million, then sold to Merv Griffin for $400 million. It was last sold for $125 million to the current owner, Sol Kerzner († March 2020).

<text>Watson Island is a neighborhood and man-made island in Biscayne Bay, in Miami, Florida. It is located Immediately east of the Central Business District and Arts &amp; Entertainment District neighborhoods of downtown Miami and is connected to the mainland and South Beach, Miami Beach by the MacArthur Causeway.

==History==
The island was deeded to the city in 1919 with the restriction that it only be used for public or municipal purposes. The city gave it to the state and the state deeded it back to the city with similar restrictions - both in the 1940s. In 1979 the city attempted to circumvent this prohibition by claiming that the underwater land surrounding the island is a preserve and Watson Island need not be protected as per the deed, as a park, or for public ownership and use.

The island had a name change from Causeway Island to Watson Island, named for John W. Watson Sr., who was Mayor of Miami 1912-1915 and 1917–1919. In 1932 Watson Island was considered for the site of Miami&#x27;s Pan-American Exposition, a World&#x27;s Fair and &quot;International Merchandise mart.&quot; By the end of the 1940s, however, the site of the Exposition, now called Interama, was moved North to where Oleta River State Park is today.
A Goodyear Blimp base was located on Watson Island from 1930 to 1978, initially on the east side of the island and later on a new landfill area to the west. Goodyear moved the base to Opa-locka Airport after failing to agree on lease renewal terms with the city. Vestiges of the old base still remain such as the imprint of the mooring circle and a paved path for a small tram that would transport passengers to the airship.

Grand plans to develop the island started in 1979, with a planned amusement park, Diplomat World. Residents formed &quot;Save Watson Island, Inc&quot;, a neighborhood group opposing the use for anything other than a park. They had public demonstrations and because of the demonstrations and a variety of other reasons, the amusement park was never built.

Another development included one from the late 1990s, culminating in 2003 when Jungle Island relocated to Watson. There has been continued controversy stemming from Jungle Island&#x27;s inability to meet the financing terms it had made with the local municipalities when the move was approved. Local elected officials had and continue to bail out Jungle Island with tax dollars. The Miami Children&#x27;s Museum also relocated to the island in 2003. The State of Florida offered a site in the Island Gardens project on Watson Island to host the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) Permanent Secretariat. As of March 2006 the Florida Department of Transportation was planning to construct a tunnel from the Port of Miami on Dodge Island under the main shipping channel to the MacArthur Causeway on Watson Island. On May 24, 2010, construction began on the Port of Miami Tunnel; it was completed on August 3, 2014.

== Current public facilities==
Aviation Center&lt;br&gt;
Chalk&#x27;s International Airlines maintained a seaplane base on Watson Island from 1926 until it ceased operation in 2007. As of 2006, the City of Miami is relocating the Miami Heliport to a site adjacent to Chalk&#x27;s seaplane base, with the intention of creating an Aviation Center serving corporate and tourism needs.

Ichimura Miami – Japanese Garden&lt;br&gt;
The Ichimura Miami - Japanese Garden grew out of the efforts of Kiyoshi Ichimura, who sent objects, materials and artisans from Tokyo to Miami in the 1950s to construct the San-Ai-An Japanese Garden on Watson Island. The garden opened in 1961. As of 2006, the garden was being redesigned and reconstructed.

Jungle Island&lt;br&gt;
Jungle Island opened its new facility on Watson Island in 2003. Originally named &quot;Parrot Jungle&quot;, the popular tourist attraction first opened in the Pinecrest neighborhood of Miami in 1936. Over the years, the attraction came to be a popular attraction for Miami residents and tourists, but that trend reversed once it moved to the smaller and less natural setting of Watson Island. Jungle Island has many fewer animals, and none of the old growth vegetation the original park was known for. Jungle Island hosts Miami&#x27;s most popular event venue with its Treetop Ballroom.

Miami Children&#x27;s Museum&lt;br&gt;
The Miami Children&#x27;s Museum opened a new facility on Watson Island in 2003. It has ten galleries, classrooms, birthday party rooms, a parent/teacher resource center, an educational gift shop, a 200-seat auditorium and a dining area.

Miami Outboard Club&lt;br&gt;
The Miami Outboard Club has been located on Watson Island since 1948. It is active in conservation and artificial reef programs, and provides social and educational activities. The club has boat slips, dry storage, a boat lift, a ramp for jet skis and other small craft, and a restaurant, bar and internet cafe.

Miami Yacht Club&lt;br&gt;
The Miami Yacht Club has been located on Watson Island since the late 1940s. It offers youth and adult sailing programs, and sponsors races, regattas and a Sea Scout ship. The club has boat slips, dry storage, and a lounge, bar and restaurant.

Public Boat Ramp&lt;br&gt;
There is a Public Boat Ramp with 50 oversized parking spaces for vehicles with boat trailers.

==Future planning==

In 2001, voters approved a bond measurer for what many thought was a public park for Watson Island and later many insisted they were tricked by the wording of the measure. However, the allowance was in fact for the City of Miami&#x27;s public partnership with a developer for a mega-yacht marina related commercial development concept, Island Gardens.

In 2004 the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County approved Island Gardens, a $281 million, hotel and marina development on Watson Island. The development included two hotels, retail and restaurant space, landscaped promenade gardens and a marina serving mega yachts. An environmental watchdog group sued to halt the project, unsuccessfully.

In 2009 the equity investor Flagstone had signed up withdrew from the project due to global financial crisis and failure of bank syndication. The city forgave the developer, enabling them to keep right of development, extending the deadline for payments. Miami developer Jorge Perez, was interested as a partner in 2013, at which point the project jumped over three times to a proposed $1B project, with interest from the Related Companies. Jorge Perez later pulled out, citing, in part, concern about their expansion regarding City of Miami Beach residents, that the project will cause traffic nightmares on the causeway between the two cities. Flagstone submitted a new outline to the City of Miami that they were not increasing their approved numbers.

==Education==

<doc id="573906" wikidata="Q2396330" url="?curid=573906" title="Letters of a Portuguese Nun">
<text>The Letters of a Portuguese Nun (French: &quot;Les Lettres Portugaises&quot;, literally &quot;The Portuguese Letters&quot;), first published anonymously by Claude Barbin in Paris in 1669, is a work believed by most scholars to be epistolary fiction in the form of five letters written by Gabriel-Joseph de La Vergne, comte de Guilleragues (1628–1684), a minor peer, diplomat, secretary to the Prince of Conti, and friend of Madame de Sévigné, the poet Boileau, and the dramatist Jean Racine.

==Publication==
From the start, the passionate letters, in book form, were a European publishing sensation (in part because of their presumed authenticity), with five editions in the collection&#x27;s first year, followed by more than forty editions throughout the 17th century. A Cologne edition of 1669 stated that the Marquis de Chamilly was their addressee, and this was confirmed by Saint-Simon and by Duclos, but, aside from the fact that she was female, the author&#x27;s name and identity remained undivulged.

The original letters were translated in several languages, including the German – &quot;Portugiesische Briefe&quot; (Rainer Maria Rilke) – and Dutch – &quot;Minnebrieven van een Portugeesche non&quot; (Arthur van Schendel). The letters, in book form, set a precedent for sentimentalism in European culture at large, and for the literary genres of the sentimental novel and the epistolary novel, into the 18th century, such as the &quot;Lettres persanes&quot; by Montesquieu (1721), &quot;Lettres péruviennes&quot; by Françoise de Graffigny (1747) and &quot;Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse&quot; by Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1761).

Also in 1669, the original publisher, Claude Barbin, published a sequel, again said to have been written by a &quot;Portuguese lady of society&quot;, with the addition of seven new letters to the original five. Later, several hack writers wrote serial stories on the same theme. To exploit the letters&#x27; popularity, sequels, replies and new replies were published in quick succession and were distributed, in translation, throughout Europe.

&quot;The Letters of a Portuguese Nun&quot; were written in the same style as the &quot;Heroides&quot;, a collection of fifteen epistolary poems composed by Ovid, and &quot;Lettres d&#x27;Héloise à Abélard&quot;, a medieval story of passion and Christian renunciation. They form a monologue beginning in amorous passion and slowly evolving, through successive stages of faith, doubt, and despair, toward a tragic end.

==Authorship==

Until the 20th century, the letters were often ascribed to a 17th-century Franciscan nun in a convent in Beja, Portugal, named in 1810 as Mariana Alcoforado (1640–1723). The letters were said to have been written to her French lover, Noël Bouton, Marquis de Chamilly (1635–1715), who came to Portugal to fight on behalf of the Portuguese in the Portuguese Restoration War from 1663–1668. The young nun was said to have first seen the young officer from her window, the now-locally famous &quot;&quot;janela de Mértola&quot;, or &quot;window of Mértola&quot;&quot;.

The attribution to Gabriel-Joseph de la Vergne, Comte de Guilleragues, was first put forward by F. C. Green in 1926, and, later, in 1953, 1961 and 1962, by Leo Spitzer, Jacques Rougeot and Frédéric Deloffre, respectively. It is now generally recognised that the letters were not a verbatim translation from the Portuguese, but were in fact a work of fiction by the Comte de Guilleragues.

However, the 2006 book &quot;Letters of a Portuguese Nun: Uncovering the Mystery Behind a 17th-Century Forbidden Love&quot; by Myriam Cyr argues that Mariana Alcoforado did, in fact, exist — and that, as an educated nun of the period, she could have written the letters; that the letters show characteristics suggesting a Portuguese original, and that Mariana was, in fact, their author. None of the arguments presented by Myriam Cyr, however, differs significantly from the 19th-century debate on the authenticity of the work, and the bulk of the critical evidence continues to favor the thesis of Guilleragues&#x27;s authorship.

In the 17th century, the interest in the &quot;Letters&quot; was so strong that the word &quot;portugaise&quot; became synonymous with &quot;a passionate love-letter&quot;.

<text>Staples Inc. is an American office supply retail company headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts.

Founded by Leo Kahn and Thomas G. Stemberg, the company opened its first store in Brighton, Massachusetts on May 1, 1986. By 1996, it had reached the Fortune 500, and it later acquired the office supplies company Quill Corporation. In 2014, in the wake of increasing competition from e-commerce market, Staples began to close some of its locations. In 2015, Staples announced its intent to acquire Office Depot and OfficeMax. However, the purchase was blocked under antitrust grounds due to the consolidation that would result.

After the failed acquisition, Staples began to refocus its operations to downplay its brick-and-mortar outlets and place more prominence on its business-to-business (B2B) services. In 2017, after its sale to Sycamore Partners, the company was effectively split into three &quot;independently managed and capitalized&quot; entities sharing the Staples name, separating its U.S. retail operations, and Canadian retail operations, from the B2B business.

==History==
Staples was founded by Leo Kahn and Thomas G. Stemberg, who were former rivals in the New England retail supermarket industry, and Myra Hart.

The idea for Staples originated in 1985, while Stemberg was working on a proposal for a different business. He needed a ribbon for his printer, but was unable to obtain one because his local dealer was closed for the Independence Day holiday. A frustration with the reliance on small stores for critical supplies combined with Stemberg&#x27;s background in the grocery business led to a vision for an office supply superstore.

The first store was opened in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston in 1986. Staples started with backing from private equity firms including Bain Capital; Bain co-founder Mitt Romney served on the company&#x27;s board of directors for the next 15 years, helping shape their business model.
In 1991, Staples founded its Canadian subsidiary, The Business Depot, and began opening stores under that name, though over a decade later, all stores were renamed as &quot;Staples&quot;. The first store opened in Vaughan, Ontario, north of Toronto. The following year, Staples began expanding into Europe, and opened its first British store in Swansea.

On September 4, 1996, Staples and Office Depot announced plans to merge. The Federal Trade Commission decided that the merged company would unfairly increase office supply prices despite competition from OfficeMax, because OfficeMax did not have stores in many of the local markets that the merger would affect. Staples argued that chains such as Walmart and Circuit City represented significant competition, but this argument did little to sway the FTC. Following the denial of the merger by the FTC, a rivalry formed between the two companies.

Staples acquired the naming rights for the Staples Center in Los Angeles shortly before construction began in 1998. Staples also acquired Quill Corporation, an online and catalog retailer of office supplies, for about $685 million in cash and stock. Between 1999 and 2001, unsuccessful attempts to enter the telecommunications business were made as Staples created Staples Communications after the purchase of Canada-based company, Claricom, from an investment group. The company was later sold to Platinum Equities and renamed NextiraOne.

In 2002, Staples acquired Medical Arts Press, which became a subsidiary of Quill.

In March 2005, Staples and Ahold announced a plan to include a Staples branded store-within-store section in all Stop &amp; Shop Supermarkets and Giant Food stores throughout the Northeast. In August 2006, Ahold announced the addition of the Staples section to all Tops Friendly Markets locations as well.

In 2008, Staples acquired Dutch office supplies company Corporate Express, one of the largest office supply wholesalers in the world.

=== Attempted merger with Office Depot; sale of UK division ===
On March 6, 2014, Staples announced it would close up to 225 stores in North America by the end of 2015, in order to cut $500 million in costs annually, and focus more on e-commerce.

On February 4, 2015, Staples announced a plan to once again acquire Office Depot, which itself had recently acquired OfficeMax in a bid to compete against Staples. CEO Ron Sargent stated that this purchase would &quot;[enable] Staples to provide more value to customers, and more effectively compete in a rapidly evolving competitive environment&quot;, and would result in at least $1 billion in &quot;cost synergies&quot; within three years.

It was reported that the deal could face antitrust scrutiny for its monopolization of the office supply market, unless growing competition against online retailers is considered a factor as well. In December, the FTC filed a lawsuit to halt the merger, arguing that it would harm competition in the commercial office supply market. and as of January 2016, the FTC has not changed its stance.

At the end of January 2016, it was announced to employees that Staples would be laying off hundreds of workers at their headquarters location. The layoffs were seen by some analysts as a preemptive tactic in case the merger did not receive regulatory approval from the Federal Trade Commission. On May 10, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the FTC a preliminary injunction against the merger. As a result, the sale was called off, and Staples was required to pay a $250 million breakup fee.

In November 2016, it was announced that Staples had sold its 106 British stores to Hilco Capital for a &quot;nominal&quot; amount, as part of an effort to streamline its international operations following the failed merger. Hilco stated that it would discontinue the Staples brand in the region; the stores were rebranded as &quot;Office Outlet&quot;, a new brand retaining the Staples chain&#x27;s red and white color scheme. In August 2018, the chain closed some of its stores under a company voluntary arrangement, and underwent a management buyout the following month. In March 2019, Office Outlet went into administration, citing that it had &quot;recently experienced a reduction in credit from key suppliers, given the economic outlook which has severely impacted the financial position of the company.&quot;

In January 2021, Staples announced that it would again try to buy Office Depot. Their offer was turned down in June 2022.

In 2022, Staples launched same-day passport photo services in over 1,000 stores and TSA PreCheck enrollment at select locations.

=== Pivot to B2B and sale to Sycamore Partners ===
Following the aborted acquisition of Office Depot, Staples began to reposition its operations by promoting itself as a &quot;solutions partner&quot; for the business market, and placing a stronger focus on its B2B-oriented delivery and e-commerce businesses. In May 2017, the chain began a new advertising campaign with the slogan &quot;It&#x27;s Pro Time&quot;, which largely downplayed its retail operations.

In 2017, Sycamore Partners acquired Staples for $6.9 billion, of which $1.6 billion was funded as equity, with the remaining deal value raised as debt. As part of the purchase, Sycamore implemented a major restructuring of the company, under which the chain&#x27;s B2B business (Staples North American Delivery, also known as simply &quot;Staples&quot;), retail locations (Staples U.S. Retail), and Staples Canada would be split into three &quot;independently managed and capitalized&quot; entities under Sycamore.

On April 9, 2019, Sycamore Partners conducted a dividend recapitalization, refinancing $5.4 billion in debt against its ownership of Staples, producing a $1 billion one-time dividend for the private equity firm. A Bloomberg report on this refinancing noted that the deal allowed Sycamore to recover roughly 80% of its equity investment in Staples in less than two years, compared to the typical profit-taking exit timeframe of five to eight years for most private equity buyouts. That month, Staples also unveiled a new logo, which features an icon representing both an unused staple and an office desk. The company also announced that it would introduce a new line of store brands, including Tru Red, Coastwide Professional (facility supplies), NXT Technologies (technology accessories), Perk (office break room supplies), and Union &amp; Scale (furniture), as well as a new catalog known as &quot;The Loop&quot;. With the rebranding, then CEO Sandy Douglas (who joined the company in 2018) stated that Staples was now being marketed as a &quot;worklife fulfillment&quot; company, which he explained was &quot;about helping businesses of all sizes as they create the most dynamic and productive work environments for their teams.&quot;

The following month, CEO Mike Motz (who joined the company in 2019 to head Staples U.S. Retail) unveiled a new store concept known as &quot;Staples Connect&quot;: it is aligned with a similar store concept being trialed by Staples Canada, featuring &quot;Staples Studio&quot; co-working areas and an auditorium-style &quot;Spotlight&quot; theater (which can be rented for sessions and events). The new concept will be trialed in the Boston area, while elements of the concept will be implemented chain-wide. As part of a partnership with radio broadcaster iHeartMedia, Staples also added recording studios intended for podcasting to six of these stores, with access to recording engineers and a partnership with Spreaker to offer discounted hosting and distribution services to its customers.

==Advertising==

Throughout most of the company&#x27;s history, Staples employed, in its American commercials and advertising promotions, the slogan &quot;Yeah, we&#x27;ve got that.&quot;, signifying their wide selection of products. This slogan was retired in 2003, to be replaced with &quot;That was easy&quot;. Expanding on that theme, 2005 adverts featured a large red push-button marked &quot;easy&quot;. In the United Kingdom, Staples had used the slogan &quot;You want it. We&#x27;ve got it&quot;; this changed to &quot;That was Easy&quot;.

=== The &quot;Easy Button&quot; ===
Originally, the &quot;Easy Button&quot; was only intended to be a fictitious button with &#x27;magical&#x27; properties, featured in their television advertisement campaign. However, when the adverts appeared, customers began contacting the company to inquire how they could buy one. The company responded by making the &quot;Easy Button&quot; a real product (available in English &quot;easy&quot;, French &quot;simple&quot;, Spanish &quot;fácil&quot;, German &quot;einfach easy&quot;, and a multi-language version launched in 2013).

These buttons were shipped to stores in the United States, Canada and Germany starting in the fall of 2005. Sales of the buttons reached 1.5 million by the end of 2006. The button has been referred to as a &quot;Marketer&#x27;s Dream&quot;, effectively turning millions of Staples customers into advertisers, resulting in greatly increased brand recognition.

=== The Staples Sno-Bot ===

The Staples Sno-Bot was an advertising character that appeared in the United States, in television and print advertising during the Christmas seasons from 1995 until 2001.

The Sno-Bot was a robot shaped like a snowman who refuses to let go of the inkjet printer he has fallen in love with. After the printer is wrestled from his grasp, the robot utters a monotone &quot;Weeping. Weeping.&quot; He is consoled by a Staples employee who offers him a surge protector or a computer mouse (depending on the ad) instead.

The robot&#x27;s &quot;Weeping. Weeping.&quot; catchphrase briefly became a popular meme on the Internet, and the ad itself was parodied in a 2002 Christmas advertisement for Dell Computers, in which a robot hassles a shopper (including striking him with a candy cane) when he attempts to purchase a PC at an unnamed office supplies retailer.

=== Back-to-school ===
Another advertisement style is used during its annual back-to-school campaign, in which the Christmas song &quot;It&#x27;s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot; is played while a father joyously shops for school supplies for his sullen-faced children, used for several years from 1995 until 2005.

Later, Alice Cooper appeared in a back-to-school campaign from August 2004. Within the ad, a hand is seen selecting various supplies while a girl (played by Madeleine Martin) looks on unhappily. She finally says, &quot;I thought you said, &#x27;School&#x27;s out forever. Alice is shown behind the cart, saying, &quot;The song goes &#x27;School&#x27;s out for summer&#x27;. Nice try, though.&quot; The hit song then plays as supplies are shown. The tagline, &quot;That was easy&quot;, is heard playing over the company logo, formed to resemble a stapler.

=== Other advertising ===
During the 2008 holiday season, Staples advertising for the first time engaged Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media platforms. The company created a character named &quot;Coach Tom&quot; to promote its &quot;Gift it for Free&quot; sweepstakes, in which 10,000 Staples customers won up to $5,000 in merchandise.

==Community relations==
In August 2002, the company started the Staples Foundation for Learning, which supports youth groups and education. It also is a partner of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, Ashoka, Earth Force, Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, Hispanic Heritage Foundation and through Staples, ReadBoston.
In August 2005, Staples introduced the &quot;Easy Button&quot;, a novelty item for offices which is advertised as a fun way of relieving stress. The button does nothing other than say &quot;That was easy&quot; when pressed. The first US$1 million of profits each year from the Easy Button are donated to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. As of December 2006, it was sold for $4.99 to $6.99 in all US and Canadian stores (where profits go to Special Olympics in Canada) and on the company&#x27;s website. Donations also went to the Children&#x27;s Fund. Staples has reportedly sold more than $7.5 million worth of Easy Buttons.

==Environmental record==
Staples is ranked in the top 25 of EPA&#x27;s Green Power Partner list. In 2006, Staples offered more than 2,900 different office products incorporating recycled content.

Staples is currently trying to pursue developing Staples brand products with green raw materials. In response to a two-year campaign targeting the company, Staples adopted an environmentally friendly paper policy, in hopes of increasing the amount of post-consumer recycled paper made available for sale, phasing out products originating from endangered forests.

The Hanover, Maryland fulfillment center is powered by a 1.01 megawatt solar installation covering nearly of roof space. Its Savi Ranch store in Yorba Linda, California also has a sizeable rooftop solar installation. Staples has also recently implemented power reduction strategies in all of their Copy &amp; Print Centers, where the copiers enter sleep mode in as little as 15 minutes after use.

This technique will save Staples nearly $1 million a year in reduced energy costs and prevent over 11 million pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere. In November 2014, Staples partnered with EnergySage to give Staples giftcards to homeowners and businesses that installed solar panels.

===Recycling===
Staples accepts all used ink and toner cartridges for recycling. Prior to 2008, the only cartridge brands that could be recycled were HP, Kodak, and Dell, and customers were given a $3 coupon for the store, with the maximum number of coupons to be given, or redeemed, at any one time being 25. Since 2009, ink recycling has been a part of the Staples Rewards program.

Staples now gives back two dollars (Staples.com) on all ink cartridges and toners as of July 2010. Ink recycling credit comes to Rewards members as a separate coupon, monthly, instead of the normal quarterly rewards check. Most customers are able to trade in ten per month for credit, whilst Staples Plus and Premier Rewards members are able to trade in twenty per month.

As of February 28, 2013, Staples announced that in order to receive $2 per ink cartridge recycled, customers would be required to spend at least $30 at Staples in ink purchases within 180 days of recycling.

==Price discrimination==
A 2012 study by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; found that Staples displayed different prices to customers in different locations (distinct from shipping prices), based on proximity to competitors like OfficeMax and Office Depot. This generally resulted in higher prices for customers in more rural areas, who were on average less wealthy than customers seeing lower prices.

==Security breaches==
KrebsOnSecurity reported a suspected breach at Staples on October 20, 2014, after hearing multiple banks had identified a pattern of card fraud (suggesting that several Staples office supply locations in the Northeastern United States were dealing with a data breach). At the time, Staples would say only that it was investigating &quot;a potential issue&quot; and had contacted law enforcement.

On December 19, 2014, Staples reported that criminals had deployed malware to point-of-sale systems at 115 of their retail stores in the United States. At 113 stores, the malware may have allowed access to this data for purchases made from August 10, 2014, through September 16, 2014. At two stores, the malware may have allowed access to data from purchases made from July 20, 2014, through September 16, 2014. Overall, the company believed that approximately 1.16 million payment cards may have been affected.

On July 14, 2015, Numerous news outlets started to report a suspected data breach at retailers served by online photo software from PNI – Staples&#x27; recent acquisition. The first reported victim was Walmart Canada, followed by CVS, Rite-Aid, Costco US, Costco Canada and Tesco UK.

During the period July 13 to 28, 2015, Staples Inc share price fell from $15.59 to $13.97, a 10% fall which reflected a reduction in Staples market value of almost $1bn.

In late 2023, Staples experienced a cyberattack that temporarily disrupted their online ordering system. The type of cyberattack is unknown, it is possible that customer information was stolen. Staples is still working to restore its systems and has not yet released a full statement on the incident.

==Store layout==
===Print and marketing services===

In addition to selling office supplies, business machines, and tech services, Staples also offers a copy and print center for photocopies, scans, digital printing, faxing, custom business cards, custom rubber stamps, promotional products, binding, lamination, folding, cutting and engraved products. While many products can be produced in-store, larger, more complex jobs, or jobs requiring special materials such as PVC signs are routed to production facilities in various locations through the country.

Most US locations have a limited service UPS shipping center offering air and ground services, as well as USPS labelled package dropoff service. Canadian stores offer three providers (Canada Post, FedEx, and Purolator), which include international shipping; whereas in US stores, this service is limited to Canada and Mexico.

In Canada, most web submission jobs and larger orders, including business cards, posters and books are produced in central production facility in each region. The production facilities operate on a 24-hour basis and orders are shipped to most of the stores within its regions within a day. The regions in Canada are BC/Yukon, Alberta/NWT, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime. The Copy &amp; Print Center was also the first Print Center to offer custom business cards printed in store. Known as &#x27;Instant Business Cards&#x27; customers are able to have custom business cards in a matter of hours. Staples also operates stand-alone Print &amp; Marketing Stores (currently there are four New York City locations, and one in Salem, Massachusetts) where Print &amp; Marketing Services is a brand of Staples.

===Tech services===
Some stores also feature Staples Tech Services (formerly EasyTech) an in-store and on-site service for PC repair, home and office networking setup, and PC tutorials.

Starting in November 2005, Staples began a test called &quot;Heavy Up&quot; primarily using stores in New York state to experiment with the expansion of the offerings by the Staples Tech Center. A subsequent test known as &quot;Double Up&quot; was planned for an unspecified test market and was scheduled to begin the first half of 2006. The tests ran to promote competition with Best Buy&#x27;s Geek Squad and Circuit City&#x27;s Fire dog.

Beginning in early 2006, Staples also launched the &quot;Easy Resident Tech&quot; program, employing one to two resident computer repair technicians to do in-store repair during normal business hours.

On January 30, 2007, Staples launched Staples EasyTech. The launch rebranded the &quot;Easy Mobile Tech&quot; name with plans to install an 11&#x27; x 17&#x27; kiosk in every store. The kiosk may vary from store to store depending on its size and volume. Most kiosks take up part of the Customer Service desk. Within the kiosk, Easy Resident Techs offered repair service as well as sold products. These technicians wore gray &quot;Easy Tech&quot; polo shirts to distinguish them from regular Staples workers. While there was typically one tech per store, a second tech may have been employed for high-volume stores.

Beginning in July 2008, Staples launched a new program labeling all technology workers as &quot;EasyTechs&quot;. Under the new guidelines all technology workers are required to have the skills necessary to perform basic services such as memory installation and PC configuration. In addition, all technology workers wear black polo shirts with green &quot;EasyTech&quot; emblems to set them apart from other store workers. The change was due to the company&#x27;s new focus on services, allowing more customers to be assisted in less time. Most stores will still have a main &quot;EasyTech&quot; who performs most of the more complex tasks.

Beginning in November 2008, eleven concept stores featuring a broader array of small business technology services were launched, which are known within the company as Best Tech stores. EasyTechs and sales workers were now referred to as &quot;Tech Advisors&quot; and &quot;Solutions Advisors&quot;. The concept stores carry many more technology related products such as digital signage, small business servers, NAS (Network Attached Storage), and business networking. Staples also partnered with an on demand IT service provider, with such services as network monitoring, advanced network configurations, and server setup.

These concept stores are mainly based in New Hampshire, with stores in Nashua, Seabrook, West Lebanon, Dover and Concord. Some stores with this new concept also opened in Massachusetts, including the Auburn store. Other existing stores have been renovated to include Best Tech&#x27;s services, including the Newington, Connecticut, and Natick store.

<text>Searching for Bobby Fischer, released in the United Kingdom as Innocent Moves, is a 1993 American drama film written and directed by Steven Zaillian in his directorial debut. Starring Max Pomeranc in his film debut, Joe Mantegna, Joan Allen, Ben Kingsley, and Laurence Fishburne, it is based on the life of prodigy chess player Joshua Waitzkin, played by Pomeranc, and adapted from the book of the same name by Joshua&#x27;s father, Fred Waitzkin. The film was nominated for Best Cinematography in the 66th Academy Awards.

==Plot==
Seven-year-old Josh Waitzkin becomes fascinated with the chess players in New York City&#x27;s Washington Square Park. His mother, Bonnie, is initially uncomfortable with his interest, as the games in the park are rife with illegal gambling and homeless players, but eventually allows Josh to play a game with a disheveled player (who charges $5 to play the game). Although Josh loses, Bonnie is amazed that he understands the rules of chess, despite having never been taught them. Another park player, Vinnie Livermore, alerts Bonnie to Josh&#x27;s advanced talent in the game.

Josh&#x27;s father, Fred, asks to play a game with his son and swiftly defeats him. It emerges, however, that Josh deliberately lost to spare his father&#x27;s feelings. When Fred prompts Josh to play a rematch honestly, Josh effortlessly defeats him.

A friendship blooms between Josh and Vinnie, who becomes a mentor. Fred requests the services of Bruce Pandolfini as a formal chess tutor for his son. Bruce takes an immediate liking to Josh, but disapproves of many of Josh&#x27;s maverick tactics, adopted from Vinnie&#x27;s tutelage. In particular, Bruce disapproves of Josh&#x27;s tendency to bring out his queen too early, and warns Fred that such careless tactics will weaken Josh&#x27;s performance in organized chess tournaments.

Against Bruce&#x27;s advice, Fred enrolls Josh in a chess tournament. Josh wins; the first in a slew of tournament victories for him. Fred develops an unhealthy obsession with Josh&#x27;s chess career, causing friction between Fred, Bonnie, and Josh&#x27;s school teacher. Josh, upset by the changes he has noticed in his father, begins losing tournaments.

As a remedy, Fred dedicates Josh entirely to Bruce&#x27;s teaching regimen, and at Bruce&#x27;s request, Josh is forbidden from playing any more games with Vinnie. Bruce&#x27;s relationship with Josh grows cold and misanthropic as Bruce seeks to harden Josh&#x27;s competitiveness. When Bruce berates Josh by showering him in &quot;meaningless Xeroxes&quot; of a certificate that Bruce had previously told Josh was a special award, Bonnie kicks Bruce out of the house.

Fred and Josh reconcile, with Fred assuring Josh that he loves his son, even if he is not a chess champion. And when Josh is allowed to resume playing chess with Vinnie, his enthusiasm for the game returns.

Josh attends the National Chess Championship, where he and Bruce reconcile. In the final tournament game, Josh is paired against Jonathan Poe, another young prodigy whose talent has intimidated Josh. The game is a back-and-forth struggle: Josh&#x27;s use of Vinnie&#x27;s reckless tactics causes him to lose his queen early in the game, but he follows up with more tactics to win Jonathan&#x27;s queen. The game continues into a complex endgame. After an overconfident move from Jonathan, Josh remembers Bruce&#x27;s disciplined teachings, and uses them to calculate a path to an assured victory. Before executing the sequence, he offers his opponent a draw. Jonathan, insulted, and not realizing his own predicament, refuses. Josh plays out a winning combination and wins the game.

==Significance of the movie title==
In 1972, young American chess champion Bobby Fischer traveled to Reykjavík, Iceland, for a match with Boris Spassky. Fred Waitzkin was smitten by the game as he was swept up in the nationwide excitement at the time, and inspired by Fischer&#x27;s charisma, began to study the strategy of chess. He realized he lacked the necessary talent to be a champion and left off, but his interest was revived a decade later when his son showed interest and talent.

==Cast==

Some famous chess players have cameos in the film: Anjelina Belakovskaia, Joel Benjamin, Roman Dzindzichashvili, Kamran Shirazi, along with the real Joshua Waitzkin, Bruce Pandolfini, Vincent Livermore, and Russell Garber. Chess master Asa Hoffmann is played by Austin Pendleton; the real Hoffmann was disappointed with his portrayal by Pendleton. Chess expert Poe McClinton, still a park regular, is seen throughout the film. Pal Benko was supposed to be in the film but his part was cut out. Waitzkin&#x27;s real mother and sister also have cameos. Bobby Fischer appears in newsreel footage.

The Russian player in the park (played by Vasek Simek) who holds up the sign &quot;&quot;, was based on the real life of Israel Zilber, who would regularly sleep in the park, awakening only for a &quot;five dollar game&quot; that he would demand in a Russian accent (reduced to &quot;two dollar game&quot; during slow times if requested) and which he would invariably win. Zilber also played the Queen&#x27;s Gambit as White. Zilber, Latvian Chess Champion in 1958, defeated the teenage Mikhail Tal in 1952, and during most of the 1980s was homeless and regarded as one of the top players in Washington Square Park.

Waitzkin&#x27;s main chess foil character in the film, Jonathan Poe (played by Michael Nirenberg), is based on chess prodigy Jeff Sarwer. When Sarwer was asked what he felt about his portrayal in the film, he stated: At the end of the day it was a Hollywood film, a work of fiction, and it helped popularize chess more so that&#x27;s always a good thing. But I have a lot of distance to the actual book and film, the way I was portrayed was nothing at all like how I was in real life so what&#x27;s the point in comparing myself to it?

==Sarwer versus Waitzkin match==

At the end of the film in the final tournament, Josh is seen playing opponent Jonathan Poe. In actual life, Josh&#x27;s opponent was Jeff Sarwer, who was younger. In September 1985, Josh first played and was defeated by Jeff at the Manhattan Chess Club. In November of the same year, Josh returned to the Manhattan Chess Club and beat him in a rematch. The film depicts their third match in the 1986 US Primary Championship. Near the end of the game, where Josh offers Poe a draw, Poe rejects the offer, the play continues and Poe loses. Sarwer rejected the draw offer in the real-world game as well, but the play continued to a draw due to bare kings. Under tournament tie-breaking rules, Waitzkin was determined to have played more challenging opponents during the overall competition and was awarded first place, but they were declared US Primary School co-champions. Sarwer went on to win the 1986 World Championship Under-10 (Boys), with his sister Julia winning the World Championship Under-10 (Girls).

===Poe versus Waitzkin endgame===

The diagram depicts the game position in the film, with Waitzkin playing the black pieces, before Waitzkin offers Poe the draw. This position did not occur in the real Sarwer–Waitzkin game; it was contrived by Waitzkin and Pandolfini for the film. The following moves are executed:

:1... gxf6 2. Bxf6 Rc6+ 3. Kf5 Rxf6+ 4. Nxf6 Bxf6 5. Kxf6?? Nd7+ 6. Kf5 Nxe5 7. Kxe5
In the October 1995 issue of &quot;Chess Life&quot;, Grandmaster Larry Evans stated that the position and sequence were : Poe (playing White) could still have drawn the game by playing 7.h5 instead. Furthermore, though not mentioned in the issue:

(i) The rook exchange 3...Rxf6+ is not a brilliancy but instead loses; 3... Nc4., 3...Nd7 and 3...Bxf6 hold the draw.

(ii) the modern Lomonosov 7-piece endgame tablebase shows White has a win after 4...Bxf6 with 5.Re2+, sacrificing White&#x27;s rook for Black&#x27;s bishop, and queening safely.

:7... a5 8. h5 a4 9. h6 a3 10. h7 a2 11. h8=Q a1=Q+ 12. Kf5 Qxh8 
White resigned.
===Alternate endgame===
An alternate endgame position had been composed by Pal Benko. It was to have been used in the film, but was rejected the day before the scene was filmed because it did not use the theme that Josh had rashly overused his queen.

&lt;br&gt;In this position, Black should play:
:1... Ne2
after which White is in zugzwang; he must play either 2.Bg3, losing the bishop to 2...Nxg3+, or 2.Bg1, allowing 2...Ng3.
==Reception==
Both the film and book received positive reviews from critics. Waitzkin&#x27;s book was praised by grandmaster Nigel Short, and journalist Edward Winter, who called it &quot;a delightful book&quot; in which &quot;the topics [are] treated with an acuity and grace that offer the reviewer something quotable on almost every page.&quot; Screenwriter and playwright Tom Stoppard called the book &quot;well written&quot; and &quot;captivating&quot;.

The film has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;As sensitive as the young man at its center, &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; uses a prodigy&#x27;s struggle to find personal balance as the background for a powerfully moving drama.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 89 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore graded the film &quot;A&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert gave the film a score of four stars (out of four), calling it &quot;a film of remarkable sensitivity and insight&quot;, adding, &quot;by the end of [the film], we have learned […] a great deal about human nature.&quot; James Berardinelli gave the film three stars (out of four), calling it &quot;an intensely fascinating movie capable of involving those who are ignorant about chess as well as those who love it.&quot;

Bobby Fischer himself never saw the film and claimed that it violated his privacy by using his name without his permission. Fischer never received any compensation from the film, calling it &quot;a monumental swindle&quot;.
The film was nominated for Best Cinematography (Conrad L. Hall) at the 66th Academy Awards for 1993 but lost to Janusz Kaminski who won for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, which was also written by Steven Zaillian. It won the category at the American Society of Cinematographers the same year. The film also ranked No. 96 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Cheers.

<text>Thomas Douglas Jones (January 26, 1945 – October 14, 2016) was an American writer, primarily of short stories.

==Biography==
Jones was raised in Aurora, Illinois, where he went to public schools. He went to college at the University of Hawaii, where he played catcher on the baseball team.

He later attended the University of Washington, from which he graduated in 1970. He studied at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa, from which he received an M.F.A. in 1973.

Jones trained in Force Reconnaissance in the Marine Corps but was discharged before his unit was sent to Vietnam. He used this and other personal experiences, including the suicide of his father, a boxer, after being confined to a mental institution, as sources for his fiction.

After graduation from college, he worked as a copywriter for a Chicago advertising agency and later as a janitor, while reading and writing for hours each day.

He was &quot;discovered&quot; well into his forties by the fiction editors of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, who published &quot;The Pugilist at Rest&quot; (1991), which won an O. Henry Award. It was included in &quot;Best American Short Stories of 1992.&quot; Other stories of his were published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, as well as in &quot;Harper&#x27;s,&quot; &quot;Esquire,&quot; &quot;Mirabella,&quot; &quot;Story,&quot; and &quot;Buzz.&quot;

In 1993 he published his first collection of stories, for which this was the title story.

Jones resided in Olympia, Washington, where he died on October 14, 2016, at the age of 71. He had temporal lobe epilepsy and diabetes. He was eulogized in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, by Joyce Carol Oates.

==Early work==
In 1973, Jones published an animal-fantasy allegory in the dystopian George Orwell mode titled &quot;Brother Dodo&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;.

==Short-Story collections==
His first book, published in 1993, was the short-story collection &quot;The Pugilist at Rest&quot;. The stories deal with common themes of mortality and pain, with characters who often find a kind of solace in the rather pessimistic philosophy of Schopenhauer. Boxing, absent or mentally ill fathers, physical trauma, and the Vietnam War are also recurring motifs. The collection was a National Book Award finalist.

Jones published two other collections of short stories, &quot;Cold Snap&quot; (1995) and &quot;Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine&quot; (1999). See List of Thom Jones Stories.

&quot;Night Train: New and Selected Stories&quot; was published in October 2018 by Little, Brown.

==Since 1999==
His story &quot;Night Train,&quot; which originally appeared in the magazine &quot;Tin House,&quot; was included in &quot;The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2004&quot;. A humorous essay, &quot;Easter Island Noodles Almondine,&quot; about a time when Jones worked as a youth for the General Mills plant in Aurora, Illinois, was published in a 2009 issue of Granta focused on Chicago. &quot;Bomb Shelter Noel,&quot; a story about a diabetic girl, was published in the January 2011 issue of &quot;Playboy.&quot;

==Script writing ==
Reports have appeared stating Jones wrote screenplays for feature films, including a Vietnam screenplay for Cheyenne Enterprises. He was reported to have adapted Larry Brown&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Rabbit Factory (2003)&quot;, as a screenplay for Ithaka Films.

==Reception ==
*His short story, &quot;The Pugilist at Rest&quot; (1991), won an O. Henry Award and was included in &quot;Best American Short Stories of 1992.&quot;
*His first collection, &quot;The Pugilist at Rest&quot; (1993), was nominated for a National Book Award.
*In a &quot;Salon.com&quot; interview, writer John Updike praised Jones as one of two writers of a younger generation he admired. Updike included Jones&#x27;s story, &quot;I Want To Live!&quot;, in the anthology, &quot;The Best American Short Stories of the Century&quot; (2000).

<text>Crispbread is a flat and dry type of bread, containing mostly rye flour. Crispbreads are lightweight and keep fresh for a very long time due to their lack of water. Crispbread is a staple food and was for a long time considered a poor man&#x27;s diet.

== Origins ==

Finland and Sweden have long traditions in crispbread consumption. The origin of the crispbread came from the earlier &#x27;stovebread&#x27; which was a similar but thicker kind of bread. These breads were baked from at least the sixth century in central Sweden. They were usually hung above the stove to be dried. Traditional crispbread in Sweden and western Finland is made in this tradition with the form of a round flat loaf with a hole in the middle to facilitate storage on long poles hanging near the ceiling. It may also have been a way to keep the rats away from them. Traditionally, crispbreads were baked just twice a year: following harvest and again in the spring when frozen river waters began to flow. The slim crispbread that is common today originated in eastern Värmland. Sweden&#x27;s first industrial crispbread bakery, AU Bergmans enka, began its production in Stockholm in 1850. Rectangular was first manufactured in Germany in 1927, and has remained popular and readily available there ever since.

Crispbread in the household is most common in Sweden (figures published in 2003); in Sweden 85 percent of households have crispbread at home, while in Germany it is 45 percent and in France 8 percent.

== Ingredients ==
Crispbread traditionally consists of wholemeal rye flour, salt, and water. Today, however, many kinds of crispbread contain wheat flour, spices and grains, and are often leavened with yeast or sourdough, and milk or sesame seeds can be added.

In the case of unleavened crispbread, bubbles are introduced into the dough mechanically. Traditionally, this was done by mixing snow or powdered ice into the dough, which then evaporated during baking. Today, the dough, which must contain a large amount of water, is cooled and mixed until bubbly.

Another method is to knead the dough under pressure in an extruder. The sudden drop in pressure then causes water to evaporate, creating bubbles in the dough.

Crispbread is only baked for a few minutes, at temperatures usually between 200 and 250 °C.

== Serving ==
Crispbread itself is very dry and therefore served with a spread, like butter, and optional toppings. Crispbread is usually a part of a daily meal. In Sweden and Finland crispbread and butter or margarine are included in school meals. Crispbread might also be crushed into yogurt or in place of cereals or muesli, and even used as a pizza base. In Sweden, crispbread is a common side dish for pea soup, as well as for pickled herring.

<text>Takadanobaba (Japanese: 高田馬場 &quot;Takada-no-baba&quot;) is a neighborhood in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.

==History==
Originally, the area&#x27;s name was read &quot;Takatanobaba&quot; and many Tokyo residents in their 50s or older pronounce it as such. However, younger Tokyoites and residents who have come from outside Tokyo, use the pronunciation &quot;Takadanobaba&quot;. The area is also often referred to simply as &quot;Baba&quot;.

The area was previously and officially known as Totsuka (戸塚). In 1636, the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemitsu built in the area a &quot;baba&quot;, a ground for horseback riding and horse racing. &quot;Takata&quot; was the family name of the mother of Matsudaira Tadateru (the sixth son of Iemitsu&#x27;s grandfather, the previous shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu) who favored the area as a sightseeing spot. The name stuck to prevent confusion with nearby Totsuka town near Yokohama (now Totsuka-ku, Yokohama).

In 1694, Nakayama Yasubei (later Horibe Yasubei, one of the forty-seven &quot;rōnin&quot;) took part in a battle (the Takadanobaba Kettō 高田馬場の決闘) there.

==Life in Takadanobaba==
The neighborhood is a transport hub for commuters traveling in from the west of Tokyo as it is home to three popular train lines: the Seibu Shinjuku Line, the JR Yamanote Line, and the Tokyo Metro Tozai Line. During the morning rush hour, Takadanobaba is one of the hot-points of the Tokyo transport network with all three stations bursting at the seams with local residents, students and commuters.

Like neighboring Waseda, the area is synonymous with students (albeit with a somewhat less salubrious image). In addition to serving students commuting to Waseda University, the area is home to many educational institutions including vocational colleges and preparatory schools. Gakushuin University is nearby, one station stop away in Mejiro.

At night, once commuters have returned to suburbs and local residents are home, the area turns into a bit of a college town. The streets around the station become crowded with large groups of students staggering out of cheap bars and izakaya.

Architecturally, the area around the station is dominated by the monolithic and appropriately named Big Box building. The building houses a sports gym, an arcade, inexpensive clothing stores, a cafe, restaurants, a 100-yen shop, and a bookstore.

The Sendagaya Japanese School together with the New York–style Ben&#x27;s Cafe (closed May 20, 2011), used English-language book shop The Blue Parrot, Mickey House made famous by the Lonely Planet&#x27;s Tokyo/Japan guides and, on the way to Waseda, the English pub The Fiddler (which closed on January 31, 2007) have placed Takadanobaba on foreigners&#x27; maps of Tokyo.

Astro Boy, a fictional character created by Osamu Tezuka in 1952, was supposedly &quot;born&quot; in Takadanobaba on April 7, 2003. In commemoration to both this and the premiere of the 2003 &quot;Astro Boy&quot; television series, starting in 2003, the JR Yamanote Line platform uses the theme music from the TV series to signal the departure of a train. Also, many lamp posts in the area carry pictures from the TV series, and two large murals depicting Tezuka&#x27;s works are across the street of JR Takadanobaba station.

Director J. J. Abrams referenced Takadanobaba as an influence on the naming of planet Takodana in the film, &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;.

<doc id="573930" wikidata="Q7445331" url="?curid=573930" title="Sedition Act of 1918">
<text>The Sedition Act of 1918 () was an Act of the United States Congress that extended the Espionage Act of 1917 to cover a broader range of offenses, notably speech and the expression of opinion that cast the government or the war effort in a negative light or interfered with the sale of government bonds.

It forbade the use of &quot;disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language&quot; about the United States government, its flag, or its armed forces or that caused others to view the American government or its institutions with contempt. Those convicted under the act generally received sentences of imprisonment for five to 20 years. The act also allowed the Postmaster General to refuse to deliver mail that met those same standards for punishable speech or opinion. It applied only to times &quot;when the United States is in war&quot;. The U.S. was in a declared state of war at the time of passage, the First World War. The law was repealed on December 13, 1920.

Though the legislation enacted in 1918 is commonly called the Sedition Act, it was actually a set of amendments to the Espionage Act.
Therefore, many studies of the Espionage Act and the Sedition Act find it difficult to report on the two &quot;acts&quot; separately. For example, one historian reports that &quot;some fifteen hundred prosecutions were carried out under the Espionage and Sedition Acts, resulting in more than a thousand convictions&quot;. Court decisions do not use the shorthand term Sedition Act, but the correct legal term for the law, the Espionage Act, whether as originally enacted or as amended in 1918.

== Earlier legislation ==
The Espionage Act of 1917 made it a crime to interfere with the war effort, disrupt military recruitment, or to attempt to aid a nation at war with the U.S. Wartime violence on the part of local groups of citizens, sometimes mobs or vigilantes, persuaded some lawmakers that the law was inadequate. In their view the country was witnessing instances of public disorder that represented the public&#x27;s own attempt to punish unpopular speech in light of the government&#x27;s inability to do so. Amendments to enhance the government&#x27;s authority under the Espionage Act would prevent mobs from doing what the government was not able to.

== Debate and enactment ==

President Wilson and his Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory viewed the bill as a political compromise. They hoped to avoid hearings that would embarrass the administration for its failure to prosecute offensive speech. They also feared other proposals that would have withdrawn prosecutorial authority from the Justice Department and placed it in the War Department, creating a sort of civilian court-martial process of questionable constitutionality. The final vote for passage was 48 to 26 in the Senate and 293 to 1 in the House of Representatives, with the sole dissenting vote in the House cast by Socialist Meyer London of New York.

While much of the debate focused on the law&#x27;s precise language, there was considerable opposition in the Senate, almost entirely from Republicans, especially Henry Cabot Lodge and Hiram Johnson. Johnson defended free speech and Lodge complained the administration had failed to use the laws already in place. Former President Theodore Roosevelt voiced opposition as well.

Officials in the Justice Department who had little enthusiasm for the law nevertheless hoped that even without generating many prosecutions it would help quiet public calls for more government action against those thought to be insufficiently patriotic.

== Enforcement and constitutional challenges==
The legislation came so late in the war, just a few months before Armistice Day, that prosecutions under the provisions of the Sedition Act were few. One notable case was that of Mollie Steimer, convicted under the Espionage Act as amended by the Sedition Act. U.S. Attorneys at first had considerable discretion in using these laws, until Attorney General Gregory, a few weeks before the end of the war, instructed them not to act without his approval. Enforcement varied greatly from one jurisdiction to the next, with most activity in the Western states where the Industrial Workers of the World labor union was active. For example, Marie Equi was arrested for giving a speech at the IWW hall in Portland, Oregon, and was convicted after the war was over.

In April 1918, the government arrested industrialist William C. Edenborn, a naturalized citizen from Germany, at his railroad business in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was accused of speaking &quot;disloyally&quot; when he allegedly belittled the threat of Germany to the security of the United States.

In June 1918, the Socialist Party figure Eugene V. Debs of Indiana was arrested for violating the Sedition Act by undermining the government&#x27;s conscription efforts. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. He served his sentence in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary from April 13, 1919, until December 1921, when President Harding commuted Debs&#x27; sentence to time served. In March 1919, President Wilson, at the suggestion of Attorney General Gregory, released or reduced the sentences of some two hundred prisoners convicted under the Espionage Act or the Sedition Act.

With the act rendered inoperative by the end of hostilities, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer waged a public campaign, not unrelated to his own campaign for the Democratic nomination for president, in favor of a peacetime version of the Sedition Act. He sent a circular outlining his rationale to newspaper editors in January 1919, citing the dangerous foreign-language press and radical attempts to create unrest in African American communities. He testified in favor of such a law in early June 1920. At one point, Congress had more than 70 versions of proposed language and amendments for such a bill, but it took no action on the controversial proposal during the campaign year of 1920. After a court decision later in June cited Palmer&#x27;s anti-radical campaign for its abuse of power, the conservative &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; found itself unable to support him any more, writing on June 25, 1920: &quot;What appeared to be an excess of radicalism ... was certainly met with ... an excess of suppression.&quot; The Alien Registration Act of 1940 was the first American peacetime sedition act.

The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Sedition Act in &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot; (1919), as applied to people urging curtailment of production of essential war materiel. Oliver Wendell Holmes used his dissenting opinion to make a commentary on what has come to be known as &quot;the marketplace of ideas&quot;. Subsequent Supreme Court decisions, such as &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; (1969), make it unlikely that similar legislation would be considered constitutional today.

==Repeal==
As part of a sweeping repeal of wartime laws, Congress repealed the Sedition Act on December 13, 1920. In 1921, president Woodrow Wilson offered clemency to most of those convicted under the Sedition Act.

<doc id="573931" wikidata="Q1684958" url="?curid=573931" title="Jean-Louis Bruguière">
<text>Jean-Louis Bruguière (; born 29 May 1943) was the leading French investigating magistrate in charge of counter-terrorism affairs. He was appointed in 2004 vice-president of the Paris Court of Serious Claims (&quot;Tribunal de Grande Instance&quot;). He has garnered controversy for various acts, including the indictment of Rwandan president Paul Kagame for the assassination in 1994 of Juvenal Habyarimana. &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Dana Priest has cited him as saying that he had in the past ordered the arrest of more than 500 suspects, some with the assistance of US authorities. According to the investigative reporter, who described the workings of Alliance Base, a CTIC joint counter-terrorist operations center, involving the DGSE, the CIA, and other foreign intelligence agencies, Bruguière declared that &quot;[he had] good connections with the CIA and FBI.&quot; Bruguière has since temporarily left his judicial functions to dedicate himself to politics, joining Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) conservative party. However, he was appointed by the European Union at the US Department of Treasury to oversee the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program.

==Biography==
The latest in a long line of magistrates (eleven generations), Bruguière studied at the Institut d&#x27;Etudes Politiques de Paris and took part in the May 1968 protests. He continued his education at the École Nationale de la Magistrature. Appointed to Évreux, he made himself known through an affair involving illegal vehicle registration cards by naming the police director as the culprit. Appointed to Paris in 1976, he began an attack on local pimps (in particular the Madame Claude network), eventually having to work under police protection.

In 1982 Bruguière declared accused Japanese cannibal Issei Sagawa unfit to stand trial by reason of insanity and Sagawa was extradited from France to Japan where he was eventually released.

Following street gunfire in 1982, Bruguière turned himself towards anti-terrorism, expanding his network and targeting in particular the far-left group Action Directe. In 1986 an anti-terrorism division was formed in Paris. A year later his apartment was targeted in a grenade attack; Bruguière, however, continued his fight. In 1994, he tracked down and captured one of the world&#x27;s most wanted terrorists, Carlos (the Jackal).

Possibly his biggest case (in terms of number of people involved) was that of UTA Flight 772 which was sabotaged over the Sahara Desert in 1989 with the loss of 170 lives. Bruguière was instrumental in having six Libyans prosecuted in Paris and convicted &quot;in absentia&quot;. However, in the 2001 book &quot;Manipulations Africaines&quot;, he was accused by the French journalist Pierre Péan of having deliberately ignored evidence pointing to Lebanon, Syria and Iran in order to put the blame on Libya.

He was also instrumental behind the controversial 1998 mass trial of 138 suspected members of the &quot;Chalabi network&quot; that supported the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) during the Algerian Civil War.

Bruguière counselled Italian senator Paolo Guzzanti (&quot;Forza Italia&quot;), in charge of the Mitrokhin Commission, endorsing the old thesis, once supported by the CIA, according to which the Soviet Union was behind Mehmet Ali Agca&#x27;s 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II. The Mitrokhin Commission has been discredited following a manipulation by a network to defame Prime minister Romano Prodi and other political opponents of Berlusconi, by claiming they worked for the KGB. The network included Mario Scaramella, arrested in December 2006, the head of SISMI Nicolò Pollari, n°2 of SISMI Marco Mancini (both indicted in the &quot;Abu Omar case&quot;), as well as Robert Seldon Lady, CIA station chief in Milan, also indicted in the &quot;Imam Rapito&quot; affair.

He was called as a witness in May 2007 by the defendants of a trial involving members suspected to have provided logistical support to the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM), involved in the 2003 Casablanca bombings. He had been in charge of the investigations concerning this case, and the defendants&#x27; lawyer questioned his methods.

He sits on the Board of Advisors of the Chertoff Group, headed by Michael Chertoff.

===Rwanda===
His controversial report into the April 1994 assassination of then-Rwandan President, Juvénal Habyarimana and his counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi, was made public on 17 November 2006. Brugière has indicted Paul Kagame, current President of Rwanda and leader of the FPR, claiming that Kagame assassinated Habyarimana to provoke the genocide against his own ethnic group, in order to take power. Bruguière&#x27;s thesis has both been very controversial and criticised by &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, &quot;Libération&quot; and other newspapers. His investigations are based on two oral sources, Abdul Ruzibiza, a former member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front who lives in exile, and Paul Barril, who was in charge of François Mitterrand&#x27;s wiretap section at the Elysee Palace and had an obscure role in Rwanda before 1994.

&quot;Le Figaro&quot; points the international dimension of the character and his contacts with intelligence agents, both in Russia and in the United States, cited justice colleagues of Bruguière, who criticize him for &quot;favourizing the raison d&#x27;état over the law.&quot; Bruguiere&#x27;s findings about the death of Habyarimana later were contradicted by the more exhaustive and documented investigation for the Cour d&#x27;Appel de Paris, Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris by Magistrates Natalie Poux and Marc Trevidic, which found that the missile that downed his plane came from the Presidential Guard camp, Kanombe, where European military cooperation officers were lodged.

===Political career===
Bruguière left his civil function as a magistrate and provided his support, in March 2007, to the right-wing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy for the presidential election. He then presented himself as candidate under the joint appellation Union for a Popular Majority (UMP, Sarkozy&#x27;s party)-Parti Radical Valoisien, in the third circonscription of the Lot-et-Garonne department, for the June 2007 legislative elections. Bruguière was defeated by his Socialist competitor, Jérôme Cahuzac, gaining only 41,71% at the second round against 52,29% for Cahuzac.

===Investigating alleged corruption at PACE===
In late May 2017, Bruguière was appointed a member of the independent external investigation body to look into allegations of corruption within the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).
