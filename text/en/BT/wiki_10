<text>The String Quartet No. 13 in B major, Op. 130, by Ludwig van Beethoven was completed (in its final form) in November 1826. The number traditionally assigned to it is based on the order of its publication; it is actually Beethoven&#x27;s 14th quartet in order of composition. It was premiered (in its original form) in March 1826 by the Schuppanzigh Quartet and dedicated to Nikolai Galitzin on its publication in 1827.

== Movements ==
Beethoven originally wrote the work in six movements, lasting 42–50 minutes, as follows:
(Nomenclature: &quot;danza tedesca&quot; means &quot;German dance&quot;, &quot;Cavatina&quot; a short and simple song, and &quot;Große Fuge&quot; means &quot;Great Fugue&quot; or &quot;Grand Fugue&quot;.)

The work is unusual among quartets in having six movements. They follow the pattern of movements seen in the Ninth Symphony and occasionally elsewhere in Beethoven&#x27;s work (opening, dance movement, slow movement, finale), except that the middle part of the cycle is repeated: opening, dance movement, slow movement, dance movement, slow movement, finale.

===New finale===
Negative reaction to the work&#x27;s final movement at the first performance, and his publisher&#x27;s urging, led Beethoven to write a substitute for the final movement, a contredanse much shorter and lighter than the enormous &quot;Große Fuge&quot; it replaced. This new finale was written in the late autumn of 1826, during a relapse into severe illness, and is the final complete piece of music Beethoven composed before his death in March 1827. It is marked: &quot;Finale: Allegro in B major&quot;. Beethoven never witnessed a performance of the quartet in its final form; it was premiered on 22 April 1827, nearly a month after his death.

The original finale was published separately under the title &quot;Große Fuge&quot; as Opus 133. Modern performances sometimes follow the composer&#x27;s original intentions, leaving out the substitute finale and concluding with the fugue. British composer Robert Simpson argues that Beethoven&#x27;s intentions are best served by playing the quartet as a seven-movement work, with the &quot;Große Fuge&quot; followed by the replacement finale.

== Judgments ==

The cavatina that serves as the fifth movement is generally considered the quartet&#x27;s pinnacle. According to Michael Steinberg, it is &quot;one of Beethoven&#x27;s most inward and wonderful slow movements.&quot; Beethoven declared &quot;that he had composed this cavatina truly in the tears of melancholy&quot; and that &quot;never had his own music made such an impression on him&quot;.

Some commentators also rank very high the freshness, grace and sensitivity of the third movement (). It was Theodor Helm&#x27;s favorite movement, and Daniel Gregory Mason used four bars of this movement as the frontispiece of his study of Beethoven&#x27;s quartets.

==In media==
The Cavatina (performed by the Budapest String Quartet) is the final piece on the Voyager Golden Record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of Earth&#x27;s sounds, languages, and music sent into interstellar space in 1977 with the two unmanned Voyager probes. It immediately follows after the gospel blues song &quot;Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground&quot; by Blind Willie Johnson, a blind and a deaf musician side by side. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; entered interstellar space in 2012; &quot;Voyager 2&quot; followed suit in 2018.

The Cavatina also appears in &quot;Love and War&quot;, an episode from the sixth season of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, in the background as Hawkeye has dinner with an aristocratic Korean woman.

== Ownership of manuscript ==
Beethoven, who died in 1827, gave the score of opus 130&#x27;s fourth movement to his secretary, Karl Holz. At least two private owners in Vienna are known to have later acquired it. In the early 20th century, it came into the possession of the Petscheks, a wealthy Czech Jewish family involved in banking and the mining industry.

Following the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938, the Petscheks fled to the United States. They attempted to send the score by post, but it was intercepted by the Gestapo. The Nazis asked an expert from The Moravian Museum in Brno to verify the score&#x27;s authenticity. According to the current museum curator Simona Šindelářová, the expert recognized Beethoven&#x27;s handwriting, but in order to save the manuscript from being looted he lied to the Nazis and said it was not authentic. The museum was then allowed to keep it. It remained with the Moravian Museum for more than 80 years.

The Nazis seized most of the Petscheks&#x27; assets and possessions, which Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Communist regime nationalized after the war. Franz Petschek, who had run the family&#x27;s mining businesses in Czechoslovakia, tried from his new home in the U.S. to get the manuscript back but got scant sympathy from the Communist government.

In August 2022, the Moravian Museum returned the manuscript to the heirs of the Petschek family, adhering to the Terezín Declaration, which urged governments to make every effort to return former Jewish properties confiscated by the Nazis, fascists and their collaborators to their original owners.

Before returning the manuscript, the museum exhibited it for five days. It had not been exhibited during the museum&#x27;s prolonged custody of it. &quot;It&#x27;s one of the most precious items in our collections&quot;, Šindelářová said. &quot;We&#x27;re sorry about losing it, but it rightly belongs to the Petschek family&quot;.

In 2024, the Beethoven House in Bonn acquired the original manuscript of the fourth movement.

<doc id="564075" wikidata="Q5331003" url="?curid=564075" title="Eastwood, Strathclyde">
<text>Eastwood was a local government district in the Strathclyde region. It was derived from the civil parish of Eastwood which had been within the county of Renfrewshire, though latterly included areas which had become annexed Lanarkshire and the expanding city of Glasgow. Established in 1975, it covered the parts of the parish outside Glasgow, plus adjoining areas to the south; it was abolished in 1996 to become part of East Renfrewshire.

==History==
Local government across mainland Scotland was reorganised in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which replaced the counties, burghs and landward districts with a two-tier system comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Renfrewshire County Council and the First District Council (which had covered the parishes of Eaglesham, Mearns, and the parts of the parishes of Cathcart and Eastwood outside the borders of Glasgow) were abolished. Eastwood District was created covering the same area as the former First District; it was one of nineteen districts within the Strathclyde region.

The districts and regions were all abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. The area of Eastwood District was merged with the Barrhead electoral division from Renfrew District to become the East Renfrewshire council area.

===Political control===
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence the Conservatives held a majority of the seats on the council:

===Elections===
Elections were held as follows:

===Premises===
The council was initially based at a converted house at 295 Fenwick Road in Giffnock. The building had previously served as the headquarters of the First District Council. The council built itself a new headquarters nearby in the grounds of Eastwood Park, moving into the new building in 1980. Following the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the Eastwood Park building became the headquarters of the replacement East Renfrewshire Council.

== Constituencies ==
The Eastwood Westminster constituency was created in 1983, and the Eastwood Holyrood constituency, with the same boundaries, in 1999.

The Westminster constituency was renamed &quot;East Renfrewshire&quot; in 2005. The Holyrood constituency retains its original name.

<doc id="564078" wikidata="Q688985" url="?curid=564078" title="Railways Act 1921">
<text>The Railways Act 1921 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5. c. 55), also known as the Grouping Act, was an act of Parliament enacted by the British government, and was intended to stem the losses being made by many of the country&#x27;s 120 railway companies, by &quot;grouping&quot; them into four large companies, dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;. The system of the &quot;Big Four&quot; lasted until the nationalization of the railways in 1947.

During World War I, the British government took control, although not ownership, of British railways. The intention was to reduce inefficient internal competition between railway companies, and retain some of the benefits which the country had derived from a government-controlled railway system during the war. The provisions of the act took effect from the start of 1923.

==History==
The British railway system had been built up by more than a hundred railway companies, large and small, and often, particularly locally, in competition with each other. The parallel railways of the East Midlands, and the rivalry between the South Eastern Railway and the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway at Hastings, were two examples of such local competition.

During the First World War the railways were under state control, which continued until 1921. Complete nationalisation had been considered, and the Railways Act 1921 is sometimes seen as a precursor to that, but the concept was rejected, and nationalisation was subsequently carried out after the Second World War, under the Transport Act 1947.

The form of the act was developed by the Minister of Transport, Eric Geddes, who was a former North Eastern Railway executive. Geddes favoured using amalgamations to create privately owned regional monopolies, and suggested increased worker participation from pre-war levels. Geddes viewed the pre-war competition as wasteful, but was opposed to nationalisation, on the grounds that it led to poor management, as well as a mutually corrupting influence between railway and political interests. In his 9 March 1920 Cabinet paper, &quot;Future Transport Policy&quot;, he proposed five English groups (Southern, Western, North Western, Eastern and North Eastern), a London passenger group, and separate single groupings for Scotland and Ireland.

Geddes&#x27; proposals became the 1920 white paper, &quot;Outline of Proposals as to the Future Organisation of Transport Undertakings in Great Britain and their Relation to the State&quot; (Cmd. 787). That suggested the formation of six or seven regional companies, and suggested worker participation on the board of directors of the company. The white paper was opposed by the Railway Companies&#x27; Association (RCA) and by MPs representing railway companies&#x27; interests. The move to greater worker participation was strongly opposed by the RCA, but supported by the Labour Party. Worker-directors were not included in the final act, being replaced by agreed negotiating mechanisms.

In 1921, the white paper, &quot;Memorandum on Railways Bill&quot; (Cmd. 1292), suggested four English regional groups and two Scottish groups. Scottish railway companies wanted to be incorporated into British groupings, and the RCA proposed five British regional monopolies including the Scottish businesses.

After consideration of the Railways Bill, it was decided that the Scottish companies, originally destined to be a separate group, would be included with the Midland/North Western and Eastern groups respectively, in order that the three main Anglo-Scottish trunk routes should each be owned by one company for their full length: the West Coast Main Line and the Midland Main Line by the former group, and the East Coast Main Line by the latter.

==The act==
The opening paragraph of the Railways Act 1921 states:

Part 1 of the act dealt with the terms and procedure of the amalgamations of railway companies. The constituents and subsidiaries of the four groups were set out in the first schedule of the act. Companies that had not formed an amalgamation scheme by 1923 would be amalgamated under terms decided by a tribunal.

Part 2 dealt with powers and regulation of the railway companies by the Railway and Canal Commission, part 3 dealt with railway rates, charges and conditions of carriage with powers given to a Railway Rates Tribunal, and part 4 with employee wages and conditions.

Parts 5 and 6 dealt with light railways and general clauses respectively, with the general clauses of part 6 including the requirement of the railway companies to provide the Minister of Transport with statistic and financial reports.

The third reading of the act in the House of Commons took place on 9 August 1921, and was passed with a majority of 237 to 62. The House of Lords made various amendments, which were accepted by the Commons on 19 August, and royal assent was given. The state control of the railways which began under war conditions during World War I was to continue for a further two years under the Ministry of Transport Act 1919.

The act took effect on 1 January 1923. On that date most of the mergers took place, although some had taken place during the previous year. The February 1923 issue of &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot; dubbed the new companies as &quot;The Big Four of the New Railway Era&quot;.

==Lines outside the act==
A number of joint railways remained outside the Big Four, continuing to be operated jointly by the successor companies. They included the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&amp;GN), a London, Midland and Scottish Railway/London and North Eastern Railway joint line in eastern England, the largest of the joint railways in terms of route mileage; the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), LMS/LNER joint line in Lancashire and Cheshire, largest in terms of both passenger and freight traffic; and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&amp;DJR), a joint LMS/SR line in south-western England.

The London suburban railway companies, such as the Underground Electric Railways Company of London and the Metropolitan Railway, were also excluded. Later, the London Passenger Transport Act 1933 amalgamated them, along with London area bus and tram operations, into the London Passenger Transport Board (see List of transport undertakings transferred to the London Passenger Transport Board).

Other exempted railways were light railways authorised under the Light Railways Act 1896, and similar lines, although some of those lines still chose to join the groups. The lines which remained independent were principally those under the influence of Colonel Stephens, who had been instrumental in securing the necessary exemption.

<text>USS &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; (CL-91/CLG-5/CG-5) was one of 27 United States Navy light cruisers completed during or shortly after World War II, and one of six to be converted to guided missile cruisers. She was the first US Navy ship to be named for Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Commissioned in late 1944, she participated in the latter part of the Pacific War in anti-aircraft screening and shore bombardment roles, for which she earned two battle stars. She then served a brief stint with the occupation force. Like all but one of her sister ships, she was retired in the post-war defense cutbacks, becoming part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet in 1947.

In the late 1950s she was converted to a guided missile cruiser, which involved removing all her guns except for her forward turret and mount, and rebuilding her entire superstructure to accommodate the Talos missile system and flagship office spaces and accommodation. Like her three sister ships (, , and ) of the &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class ships converted to missile ships, she was also extensively modified forward to become a flagship. This involved removal of most of her forward armament to allow for a greatly enlarged superstructure. She was recommissioned in 1960 as CLG-5 (and in 1975 redesignated CG-5).

In her second career she served extensively in the Pacific, playing a prominent role in the Vietnam War, including participation in the evacuation of Saigon. &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was worked hard in shore bombardment duty during the war. As she was extensively well fitted with flagship accommodations and communications, there were plans for an extensive overhaul (of both her and &quot;Little Rock&quot;) starting in 1977. The ship would have received two 8-cell NATO Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers and two Vulcan Phalanx CIWS systems, in addition to extensive rehabilitation of her propulsion systems, electrical systems, her hull and superstructure. This would have given her an additional 10 years of service life. While this work package was formally planned, and funding was appropriated, it was diverted elsewhere. She received enough maintenance to soldier on for a few more years and was decommissioned for the last time in December 1979. At the time of her decommissioning, she was the last &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class ship in service, and had served longer (a total of 21 years and 10 months) than any other ship of that class.

&quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was sunk during a weapons training exercise, Tandem Thrust 99, on 26 March 1999.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was laid down on 8 December 1942, by Cramp Shipbuilding of Philadelphia; launched on 20 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Anton H. Classen; and commissioned on 22 December 1944.

==Service history==

===World War II===

Following shakedown, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; transited the Panama Canal and reported to Commander Cruisers Pacific Fleet (ComCruPac) for duty, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 2 May 1945. She conducted local operations until 22 May, when she sailed for Ulithi, thence to rendezvous on 6 June, with Carrier Task Group 38.1 for operations in support of the Okinawa campaign. For the rest of June, and into July, she screened 3rd Fleet carriers during their intensified air operations against Japanese forces. On 18 July, she formed a bombardment group with other cruisers and destroyers, then rejoined the carrier task group for continued action against the Japanese home islands. At the end of hostilities, she continued to patrol off the coast of Japan and it was not until 10 September, after seventy-two days of continuous steaming, that she finally entered Tokyo Bay. &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; remained on occupation duty until relieved on 30 January 1946, when she departed for the United States. She arrived at San Francisco on 14 February, where she remained until 15 August, when she entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for inactivation. On 30 June 1947, she was placed out of commission in reserve, assigned to the San Francisco Group, US Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===Conversion to &quot;Galveston&quot;-class cruiser===

On 7 March 1957, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; arrived at the Bethlehem Steel Corp. Pacific Coast Yard, San Francisco, where conversion to a guided missile light cruiser commenced on 21 May, her hull classification and number being changed two days later to CLG-5. Her conversion having completed on 31 August 1960, she was towed to Hunter&#x27;s Point where she recommissioned on 7 September.

During her shakedown training, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; became the first combatant unit of the US Pacific Fleet to fire a Talos guided missile successfully. Following shakedown, she participated in several major training exercises while serving as flagship for Cruiser Division 3 (CruDiv 3) and Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla 9 (CruDesFlot 9), then departed 1 December, for a six-month deployment in WestPac. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 24 December, where, six days later, she became flagship for Commander, US 7th Fleet. The ship participated in SEATO training operations, received two awards for operational excellence, and served as an ambassador of good will to several cities in the Far East. She then returned to Long Beach, California, on 12 June 1962, and spent the next several months conducting local training operations and upkeep work. On 14 December, she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for restricted availability followed by an extensive overhaul.

===Vietnam===
In early 1964, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; began refresher training in Southern California waters to prepare for a lengthy deployment, then departed for Yokosuka where she arrived on 7 July, to assume her duties again as 7th Fleet flagship. Shortly thereafter, North Vietnamese gunboats attacked a US destroyer in the Tonkin Gulf and &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; quickly began a 25-day alert in the Gulf. Training exercises and operational visits to various ports in the Far East followed, then in June 1965, she began gunfire support missions off Vietnam. When the level of hostilities increased, she began to spend more and more time in the South China Sea and eventually participated in operations &quot;Piranha&quot;, &quot;Double Eagle&quot;, &quot;Deckhouse IV&quot;, and &quot;Hastings II.&quot; After serving as 7th Fleet flagship for two and one-half years, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; returned to San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard on 15 December 1966, for an overhaul.
Following her yard period, she began refresher training in the Southern California operating area in July 1967, and continued those exercises and intermittent calls to West Coast ports until she deployed again to the Western Pacific (WestPac) 7 November 1968. She arrived at Yokosuka 20 December, and into August 1969, was again contributing to the strength of the 7th Fleet. The ship provided naval gunfire support for troops in South Vietnam, gunfire operations against coastal targets in North Vietnam and anti-aircraft operations in North Vietnam. In April 1969, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was sent to the Sea of Japan with three carrier groups after North Korea shot down an EC-121 spy plane.

As of 1 July 1969, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was under the administrative control of Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Force, US Pacific Fleet and Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Nine. Both Commanders had their headquarters in San Diego, California. &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was flagship and under the operational control of Commander Seventh Fleet. Also, while in the Western Pacific, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; reported to Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group Seventh Fleet for administrative purposes. As Flagship for Commander Seventh Fleet, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was designated flagship Group TG 70.1 with the Commanding Officer as Commander of the Group. &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; also served as a unit of TG 70.8.9 while providing gunfire support off the coast of Vietnam. The ship was homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, at the time.

Upon arrival at Yankee Station in September 1969, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; conducted helicopter operations. She also refueled from the replenishment ship and was visited by Rear Admiral Isaman, Commander Carrier Division Seven and Rear Admiral McClendon, Commander Carrier Division Nine. En route to Okinawa, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; experienced a drop in chemical readings in number 4 boiler caused by a leak in tube Y-36. Upon arrival Okinawa, the ship conducted Exercise Z-3l-GM, short range Talos missile firing exercise, in Okinawa operating area W-173.

On 4 February 1972, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; fired the first successful combat surface-to-surface missile shot in US Navy history, using the new Talos RIM-8H anti-radiation missile to destroy a North Vietnamese mobile air control radar van. On 19 April 1972, the cruiser was attacked by one of two Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) MiG-17s, flown by pilots Le Xuan Di and Nguyen Van Bay (aka &quot;Bay A&quot;), both from the VPAF 923rd Fighter Regiment. Each MiG was armed with two bombs, Van Bay&#x27;s target was the light cruiser. Van Bay made two passes on the cruiser, having overshot his target on the first run, dropped his two bombs near &quot;Oklahoma City&quot;, but caused only light damage. Another accompanying ship, the destroyer was damaged by a direct hit from the second MiG flown by pilot Le Xuan Di, which destroyed her aft 5–inch gun mount.

In April 1975, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam. Following this she was slated for a massive overhaul, as her flagship facilities, as well as her 6-inch guns made her an attractive asset to retain in service. Her now obsolete Talos system would be removed and two Sea Sparrow SAM systems, and two Phalanx CIWS mounts would be fitted. Her machinery and hull would also be repaired and renewed. While funding for this work was appropriated by Congress, it was diverted to other ships, and minimal repairs were made to keep &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; operational until 1979.

===Decommissioned and sunk===

&quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was decommissioned on 15 December 1979, and remained in the Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay until 9 January 1999, when she was towed to Pearl Harbor, where some usable material was donated for use in outfitting the battleship as a museum ship. &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was then expended as a target during February–March. After being used as a target for air-launched missiles she was hit during Tandem Thrust &#x27;99 exercise southwest of Guam by torpedoes from the South Korean submarine &quot;Lee Chun&quot;, broke in two and sank on 27 March 1999.

&quot;Oklahoma City&quot; was the last &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class cruiser in service and had the longest service history of all ships in the class. Accumulating some 13 battle stars for Vietnam-era engagements as flagship of the United States Seventh Fleet, &quot;Oklahoma City&quot; has been commemorated at the National Museum of the Pacific War originally named the Admiral Nimitz Museum located in Fredericksburg, Texas. Two plaques honor her service in World War II and Vietnam. On 22 September 2006, the World War II plaque was dedicated. The Vietnam Plaque was dedicated on 11 April 2008, and calls her the &quot;Haze grey Ghost of the Western Pacific&quot;.

<text>The Alliance for Progressive Government (APG), a political pressure group in the Isle of Man, was formed in 1991 as a grouping of members of the House of Keys (MHKs) who wanted to provide a coherent opposition to the Manx government. They were initially called the Alternative Policy Group, before changing their name to the Alliance for Progressive Government in 1998. At their formation they had five MHKs, and in the 1996 general election they had six members elected. Two more were elected at by-elections, giving them at one stage eight out of the 24 members of the House of Keys; but 3 MHKs resigned from the Alliance between 1996 and 2001. In the 2001 election they had three members elected (out of four candidates nominated).

The APG MHKs made a point of advancing alternative policies to the Isle of Man Government, as well as questioning and scrutinising government policy.

<text>USS &quot;Pasadena&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Pasadena&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-four Bofors guns in four quadruple and four double mounts and twenty-one Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Pasadena&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==

The keel for &quot;Pasadena&quot; was laid down at the Fore River Shipyard on 6 February 1943. She was launched of 28 December, and was commissioned on 8 June 1944. After entering service, she carried out a shakedown cruise and initial training into September, before departing on 25 September to join American naval forces fighting in the Pacific Theater of World War II. She reached the Navy&#x27;s forward operating base at Ulithi in mid-November, where she joined the Fast Carrier Task Force, then designated Task Force 38. &quot;Pasadena&quot; operated as part of the screen for the task force&#x27;s aircraft carriers as they carried out a series of strikes against Japanese targets in the Philippines and Formosa to support the Philippines campaign. These operations carried on into 1945, and in January, the unit entered the South China Sea to strike Japanese installations in French Indochina and Formosa. Attacks on Japan itself followed in February, and then the carriers turned their attention to the invasion of Iwo Jima later that month. During the battle on that island, &quot;Pasadena&quot; took part in shore bombardment operations to support the marines fighting to secure it.

The Fast Carrier Task Force then returned to Ulithi to replenish stores and take on munitions before getting underway again in mid-March to begin the preparatory attacks on Okinawa in advance of the invasion of that island. These included air raids on the northern Ryukyu Islands and southern Japan to neutralize forces that would interfere with the planned landings. During this period, &quot;Pasadena&quot; served as the flagship of Cruiser Division 17, which carried out night bombardments of Minami Daito on 28 March and 10 May. Operations off Okinawa to support the forces that had gone ashore in April continued through the end of May, and in June, the Fast Carrier Task Force withdrew to Ulithi for another period of rest and replenishment. The ships sortied once again in early July to begin another round of attacks on the Japanese home islands; these attacks continued until mid-August, stopping only on 15 August when Japan indicated it would surrender unconditionally. &quot;Pasadena&quot; thereafter took part in the occupation of Japan; she became the flagship of Task Group 35.1 on 23 August, and four days later she dropped anchor in Sagami Bay outside Tokyo. On 1 September, she moved to Tokyo Bay in preparation for the formal surrender ceremony that took place the following day. In her relatively brief wartime career, &quot;Pasadena&quot; was awarded five battle stars.

&quot;Pasadena&quot; remained in Tokyo Bay through mid-January 1946, helping to oversee the occupation of the Japanese capital. She was recalled home on 19 January for an overhaul in San Pedro, California. After she emerged from the shipyard, she took part in training exercises in the area until September, when she sailed back to the central Pacific. She took part in divisional training exercises in Micronesia from November 1946 to February 1947, followed by fleet maneuvers off Hawaii, before returning to California. The year 1948 began with training maneuvers off California, followed by an NROTC training cruise. She made another voyage to East Asia on 1 October, which included a visit to Qingdao, China, at the end of the month. She patrolled off the Chinese coast until May 1949, when she once again returned to California, arriving on 1 June. Over the following months, she took part in training exercises in the area before going to sea for the last time on 12 September, bound for Bremerton, Washington, where she was laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was formally decommissioned on 12 January 1950. She remained there until 1970. She was stricken from the naval register on 1 December that year and thereafter discarded.

<doc id="564088" wikidata="Q3161173" url="?curid=564088" title="Ian Trethowan">
<text>Sir James Ian Raley Trethowan (20 October 1922 – 12 December 1990) was a British journalist, radio and television broadcaster and administrator who eventually became Director-General of the BBC from 1 October 1977 to 31 July 1982, having previously been managing director of BBC network radio from 1970 to 1976.

==Early life and education==
Son of Major James Jackson Raley Trethowan (1893-1974), of 6, Ashleigh Court, Surbiton, Surrey, formerly of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, MBE, a retired officer of the York and Lancaster Regiment who worked in business, army welfare, and sports writing for the Sunday papers (including the Sunday Times, Evening Standard, and Yorkshire Post), after leaving the Army, and his first wife, Winifred, née Timms, Trethowan was educated at the independent Christ&#x27;s Hospital school near Horsham in West Sussex.

==Career==
Trethowan started work as a journalist and parliamentary lobby correspondent. He became a presenter for Independent Television News in the late 1950s and early 1960s, co-presenting ITN&#x27;s coverage of the 1959 general election.

He moved to the BBC in about 1963, and was part of Grace Wyndham Goldie&#x27;s group of heavy hitting journalists which included Richard Dimbleby and Robin Day. Trethowan was a regular presenter of political programmes such as &quot;Gallery&quot;, &quot;Panorama&quot; and general election and budget specials. He presented the BBC&#x27;s tribute programme to President John F. Kennedy on the day of his assassination.

A Conservative, and a close friend of the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, Trethowan has been criticised for his support of the Security Service &quot;vetting&quot; of BBC employees which has often been seen as a means of weeding out leftists in the corporation. Trethowan allowed MI5 to remove half the content from a Panorama documentary made by BBC journalist Tom Mangold, this emerged in December 2011, when 30-year-old British government papers were released. Trethowan told the press at the time that nobody from the government had seen the film or put pressure on the BBC but in fact he had met the heads of Security Service (MI5) and the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), shown them a tape of the programme and invited them to suggest cuts to it. The programme-makers defended their programme and, although changes were made, the transmitted version still annoyed the intelligence agencies. However, his genuflection to those in power ensured that his five years in charge of the BBC were generally very stable and secure for the organisation.

Cautious and conservative-minded, he was responsible for the sacking of Kenny Everett from Radio 1 in 1970 for making a joke suggesting that the wife of John Peyton, the transport minister in the Conservative government, had only passed her driving test because she had &quot;slipped the examiner a fiver&quot;.

In 1979, when Trethowan was Director-General, the BBC governors scuppered a plan to broadcast Michael Parkinson&#x27;s chat show three nights a week, probably because the idea seemed too populist.

Trethowan&#x27;s final months at the BBC saw the Thatcher government dissatisfied with what it saw as the corporation&#x27;s insufficiently patriotic coverage of the Falklands War. From 1987 until his death from motor neurone disease, he was chairman of Thames Television. He was knighted in 1980.

In 1994, when announcing her plans to reduce the dominance of received pronunciation and include more regional accents on Radio 3 and Radio 4, Liz Forgan (who then held Trethowan&#x27;s old post as managing director of BBC network radio) said that she wanted to move away from the attitude she said he had expressed when he heard a Birmingham accent on BBC radio and said &quot;What is that sound doing on the BBC? Get it off.&quot;

<text>Kilmarnock and Loudoun () was one of nineteen local government districts in the Strathclyde region of Scotland from 1975 to 1996.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Kilmarnock and Loudon was one of nineteen districts created within the region of Strathclyde. The district covered the whole area of five former districts and most of a sixth from the historic county of Ayrshire, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Darvel Burgh
*Galston Burgh
*Kilmarnock Burgh
*Kilmarnock District (except the part within the designated area of Irvine New Town)
*Newmilns and Greenholm Burgh
*Stewarton Burgh

The district was abolished in 1996 by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which replaced the regions and districts with unitary council areas. The district&#x27;s area was combined with that of Cumnock and Doon Valley to form the East Ayrshire council area.

The name Kilmarnock and Loudoun continues to be used for a constituency of the House of Commons and, covering a similar area, a Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency of the Scottish Parliament.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:
==Premises==

The council based itself in Kilmarnock, the area&#x27;s largest town. The former Kilmarnock Town Hall on King Street was demolished around the same time the new district council was created. The council instead based itself at two pre-existing buildings on either side of John Dickie Street, calling them the Civic Centre. On the south side of the street the council chambers were in a building on the corner with John Finnie Street, which had been built in 1905 as Wallace Chambers, offices for distillery William Wallace and Company. Opposite it on the north side of John Dickie Street the council also took over the former headquarters of the Kilmarnock Co-operative Society, which had been built in 1880.

The Civic Centre continues to be used as secondary offices by the council&#x27;s successor, East Ayrshire Council, although that council established its headquarters at a converted school on London Road in Kilmarnock.

<text>USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (CL-41) was a of the United States Navy. She was the fifth ship named for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1951, she was sold to Brazil and commissioned into the Brazilian Navy as Almirante Barroso.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; was laid down on 28 May 1935 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 17 November 1936; sponsored by Mrs. Huberta F. Earle (née Potter), first lady of Pennsylvania and wife of Governor George H. Earle III; and commissioned at Philadelphia on 23 September 1937, Captain Jules James in command.

==United States Navy==

===Inter-war period===
After fitting out, the cruiser departed Philadelphia on 3 January 1938 for shakedown in the West Indies followed by additional alterations at Philadelphia and further sea trials off the Maine coast.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; called at Charleston, South Carolina, on 30 April and hosted President Franklin Delano Roosevelt the first week of May for a cruise in Caribbean waters. The President debarked at Charleston on 8 May, and &quot;Philadelphia&quot; resumed operations with Cruiser Division 8 (CruDiv 8) off the Atlantic coast. She was designated flagship of Rear Admiral Forde A. Todd, Commander CruDiv 8 (ComCruDiv 8), Battle Force on 27 June. In the following months, she called at principal ports of the West Indies, and at New York City, Boston, and Norfolk, Virginia.

Transiting the Panama Canal on 1 June 1939, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; joined CruDiv 8 in San Pedro, California, on 18 June for Pacific coastal operations. She departed Los Angeles, California, on 2 April 1940 for Pearl Harbor, where she engaged in fleet maneuvers until May 1941.

In September 1940, fifteen of the ship&#x27;s African American mess men wrote an open letter to a newspaper protesting the treatment of African Americans in the Navy. &quot;We sincerely hope to discourage any other colored boys who might have planned to join the Navy and make the same mistake we did. All they would become is seagoing bell hops, chambermaids and dishwashers,&quot; they wrote. On publication of the letter, the fifteen were confined to the brig. They were later dishonorably discharged. The incident drew protests from hundreds of mess men on other ships as well as anger in the African American community, and led to a series of meetings between Roosevelt and NAACP leaders A. Philip Randolph and Walter White to discuss partial desegregation of the armed forces.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor on 22 May 1941 to resume Atlantic operations, arriving Boston on 18 June. At this point, she commenced Neutrality Patrol operations, steaming as far south as Bermuda and as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia. She entered Boston Navy Yard on 25 November for upkeep, and was in repair status there when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.

===World War II===

====1942====
11 days after the Japanese attack, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; steamed for exercises in Casco Bay, after which she joined two destroyers for anti-submarine patrol to NS Argentia, Newfoundland. Returning to New York on 14 February 1942, she made two escort runs to Hafnarfjörður, Iceland. She then joined units of Task Force 22 (TF 22) at Norfolk on 16 May, departing two days later for an anti-submarine warfare sweep to the Panama Canal.

She then returned to New York, only to depart on 1 July as an escort unit for a convoy bound for Greenock, Scotland. The middle of August found her escorting a second convoy to Greenock. Returning to Norfolk on 15 September, she joined Rear Admiral H. Kent Hewitt’s Western Naval Task Force.

This force was to land some 35,000 troops and 250 tanks of General George Patton&#x27;s Western Task Force at three different points on the Atlantic coast of French Morocco. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; became flagship of Rear Admiral Lyal A. Davidson, commanding the Southern Attack Group. which was to carry 6,423 troops under Major General Ernest N. Harmon, with 108 tanks, to the landing at Safi, Morocco, about 140 mi (220 km) south of Casablanca.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot;″s task group departed Norfolk on 24 October and set course as if bound for the British Isles. The entire Western Naval Task Force, consisting of 102 ships and spanning an ocean area some 20 × 40 mi (30 × 60 km), combined off Cape Race on 28 October. It was the greatest war fleet sent forth by the United States at the time.

The task force swept northward on 6 November, thence changed course toward the Straits of Gibraltar. But after dark, a southeasterly course was plotted towards Casablanca, and shortly before midnight on 7 November, three separate task groups closed three different points on the Moroccan coast.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; took up its fire support station as the transports offloaded troops in the early morning darkness of 8 November. Shore batteries opened fire at 0428, and within two minutes &quot;Philadelphia&quot; joined in bombardment of &quot;Batterie Railleuse&quot; which, with four 5.1 in (130 mm) guns, was the strongest defense unit in the Safi area. Later in the morning, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; bombarded a battery of three 6.1 in (155 mm) guns about 3 mi (5 km) south of Safi.

Spotter planes from the cruiser also got into the act by flying close support missions. One of &quot;Philadelphia&quot;″s aircraft discovered and bombed a Vichy French submarine on 9 November in the vicinity of Cape Kantin. The next day, the Vichy submarine &quot;Medeuse&quot;, one of eight that had sortied from Casablanca, was sighted down by the stern and listing badly to port, beached at Mazagan, north of Cape Blanco. Thought to be the same submarine previously attacked off Cape Kantin, &quot;Medeuse&quot; was again spotted by a plane from &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and was subsequently bombed.

====1943====
Departing Safi on 13 November, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; returned to New York on 24 November. Operating from that port until 11 March 1943, she assisted in escorting two convoys to Casablanca. She then joined Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk’s TF 85 for training in Chesapeake Bay preparatory to the invasion of Sicily.

A convoy escorted by Philadelphia and nine destroyers sortied from Norfolk on 8 June and arrived Oran, Algeria on 22 June, where final invasion staging operations took place. The convoy stood out from Oran on 5 July, and arrived off the beaches of Scoglitti, Sicily shortly before midnight of 9 July. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; assisted in furnishing covering bombardment as the troops of Major General Troy Middleton’s 45th Infantry Division stormed ashore. By 15 July, she had joined the gunfire support group off Porto Empedocle, where her guns were put to good use.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; took departure from her gunfire support area on 19 July and steamed to Algiers, where she became flagship of Rear Admiral L. A. Davidson’s Support Force. This TF 88 was formed on 27 July and given the mission of the defense of Palermo, gunfire support to the Seventh Army’s advance along the coast, provision of amphibious craft for &quot;leap frog&quot; landings behind enemy lines, and ferry duty for heavy artillery, supplies, and vehicles to relieve congestion on the railway and the single coastal road. &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, , and six destroyers entered the harbor at Palermo on 30 July and the next day commenced bombardment of the batteries near Santo Stefano di Camastra.

Action in the area of Palermo continued until 21 August, when &quot;Philadelphia&quot; steamed for Algiers. During her operations in support of the invasion of Sicily, the cruiser had provided extensive gunfire support and, in beating off several hostile air attacks, had splashed a total of six aircraft. She touched at Oran, departing on 5 September &quot;en route&quot; to Salerno.

Her convoy entered the Gulf of Salerno a few hours before midnight of 8 September 1943. &quot;Philadelphia&quot;″s real work began off the Salerno beaches at 0943 the next day, when she commenced shore bombardment. When one of her scouting planes spotted 35 German tanks concealed in a thicket adjacent to Red Beach, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;″s guns took them under fire and destroyed seven of them before they escaped to the rear.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; narrowly evaded a KG 100-launched glide bomb on 11 September, although several of her crew were injured when the bomb exploded. While bombarding targets off Aropoli on 15 September, the cruiser downed one of 12 attacking planes and assisted in driving off a second air attack the same day in the vicinity of Altavilla. She downed two more hostile aircraft on 17 September and cleared the gunfire support area that night, bound for Bizerte, Tunisia. After upkeep at Gibraltar, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; departed Oran, Algeria on 6 November as part of the escort for a convoy which arrived at Hampton Roads on 21 November.

====1944====
&quot;Philadelphia&quot; underwent overhaul at New York and then engaged in refresher training in Chesapeake waters until 19 January 1944, when she steamed from Norfolk as an escorting unit for a convoy arriving Oran, Algeria on 30 January.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; joined the gunfire support ships off Anzio on 14 February and provided support for the advancing ground troops through 23 May. On this same day she collided with the . She then sailed to the British naval yard at Malta, where repairs to her bow were effected. After overhaul at Malta, she joined Admiral C. F. Bryant’s Task Group 85.12 (TG 85.12) at Taranto, Italy. The cruiser served as one of the escorting units for the group, which reached the Gulf of Saint-Tropez, France, on 15 August. At 0640, she teamed with and and, with other support ships, they closed the beaches and provided counter-battery fire. By 0815, the bombardment had destroyed enemy defenses, and Major General William W. Eagles’ famed &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; of the 45th Army Infantry Division landed without opposition.

After replenishing ammunition at Propriano, Corsica, on 17 August, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; provided gunfire support to the French army troops on the western outskirts of Toulon. Four days later, her commanding officer, Captain Walter A. Ansel, accepted the surrender of the fortress islands of Pomeques, Château d&#x27;If, and Ratonneau in the Bay of Marseilles. After gunfire support missions off Nice, she departed Naples on 20 October and returned to Philadelphia, Pa., arriving on 6 November.

====1945====
Philadelphia underwent overhaul at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and then refresher training in the West Indies, returning to Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 June 1945. She steamed for Antwerp, Belgium on 7 July, acting as escort for which had embarked President Harry S. Truman and his party, including Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy. Arriving Antwerp on 15 July, the President departed &quot;Augusta&quot; and was flown to the Potsdam Conference. Before the conference ended, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; proceeded to Plymouth, England, to await return of the President.

On 2 August, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; rendered honors to King George VI, who visited President Truman aboard &quot;Augusta&quot;. The ships departed that same day and Philadelphia arrived Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 August.

===Post-war===
&quot;Philadelphia&quot; stood out of Narragansett Bay for Southampton, England, on 6 September, returning on 25 September as escort for the former German liner &quot;Europa&quot;. After operations in Narragansett Bay and in Chesapeake Bay, she arrived Philadelphia on 26 October. Steaming for Le Havre, France, on 14 November, she embarked Army passengers for the return to New York on 29 November. She made another &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; run from New York to Le Havre and return from 5 to 25 December, and arrived at Philadelphia for inactivation on 9 January 1946.

&quot;Philadelphia&quot; decommissioned in the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 3 February 1947. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 January 1951, she was sold to the government of Brazil under terms of the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. She served in the Brazilian Navy under the name &quot;Barroso&quot; (C–11) and was scrapped in 1974.

<doc id="564095" wikidata="Q146614" url="?curid=564095" title="Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)">
<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 23 in F minor, Op. 57 (colloquially known as the Appassionata, meaning &quot;passionate&quot; in Italian) is among the three famous piano sonatas of his middle period (the others being the &quot;Waldstein&quot;, Op. 53 and &quot;Les Adieux&quot;, Op. 81a); it was composed during 1804 and 1805, and perhaps 1806, and Beethoven dedicated it to cellist and his friend, Count . The first edition was published in February 1807 in Vienna.

Unlike the early Sonata No. 8, &quot;Pathétique&quot;, the &quot;Appassionata&quot; was not named during the composer&#x27;s lifetime, but was so labelled in 1838 by the publisher of a four-hand arrangement of the work. Instead, Beethoven&#x27;s autograph manuscript of the sonata has &quot;La Pasionata&quot; written on the cover, in Beethoven&#x27;s hand.

One of his greatest and most technically challenging piano sonatas, the &quot;Appassionata&quot; was considered by Beethoven to be his most tempestuous piano sonata until the twenty-ninth piano sonata (known as the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot;). 1803 was the year Beethoven came to grips with the irreversibility of his progressive hearing loss.

An average performance of the entire &quot;Appassionata&quot; sonata lasts about twenty-five to twenty-seven minutes.

==Form==
The sonata consists of three movements:
===Allegro assai===

A sonata-allegro form in time, the first movement progresses quickly through startling changes in tone and dynamics, and is characterised by an economic use of themes.

The main theme, in octaves, is quiet and ominous. It consists of a down-and-up arpeggio in dotted rhythm that cadences on the tonicized dominant, immediately repeated a semitone higher (in G). This use of the Neapolitan chord (i.e. the flattened supertonic) is an important structural element in the work, also being the basis of the main theme of the finale.

As in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Waldstein&quot; sonata, the coda is unusually long, containing quasi-improvisational arpeggios which span most of the early 19th-century piano&#x27;s range. The choice of F minor becomes very clear when one realises that this movement makes frequent use of the deep, dark tone of the lowest F1 on the piano, which was the lowest note available to Beethoven at the time.

The total performance time of this movement is usually between and 11 minutes.

===Andante con moto===

A set of variations in D major, on a theme remarkable for its melodic simplicity combined with the use of unusually thick voicing and a peculiar counter-melody in the bass. Its sixteen bars (repeated) consist of nothing but common chords, set in a series of four- and two-bar phrases that all end on the tonic. (see image) The four variations follow:

The fourth variation ends with a deceptive cadence containing the dominant 7th chord instead of the tonic that resolves to a soft diminished seventh on B marked (&quot;pianissimo&quot;), followed by a much louder diminished seventh, marked (&quot;fortissimo&quot;), at an octave higher that serves as a transition (without pause) to the finale.

The total performance time of this movement is about 6 to 8 minutes.

===Allegro ma non troppo – Presto===

The third movement is a sonata-allegro in near-perpetual motion. It opens with a diminished 7th chord in B that is repeated 12 times. In this movement, the second part is directed to be repeated instead of the first, giving it a rondo character. It has much in common with the first movement, including extensive use of the Neapolitan sixth chord and several written-out cadenzas. The movement climaxes with a coda, marked &quot;Presto&quot; and in a &quot;two-phase binary form&quot;. A new theme is introduced, followed by the reinstatement of the main theme at a faster tempo, before ending with a series of descending arpeggios in F minor. According to Donald Tovey this is one of only a handful of Beethoven&#x27;s works in sonata form that in tragedy (the others being the C minor Piano Trio, Piano Sonata Op. 27, No. 2 (&quot;Moonlight&quot;), and the Violin Sonata Op. 30, No. 2.).

The total performance time of this movement is about 7 to 8 minutes with the repeats and about to 6 minutes without them.

<text>Jerry Vale (born Gennaro Louis Vitaliano; July 8, 1930 – May 18, 2014) was an American traditional pop singer. During the 1950s and 1960s, he reached the top of the pop charts with his interpretations of romantic ballads, including a cover of Eddy Arnold hit &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; (1956) and &quot;Have You Looked into Your Heart&quot; (1964). Vale, who was of Italian descent, sang numerous songs in Italian, many of which were used in soundtracks by films of Martin Scorsese.

Vale showed his love of Italian music with his albums, &quot;I Have But One Heart&quot; (1962) and &quot;Arrivederci, Roma&quot; (1963), full of Italian standards such as &quot;Amore, Scusami&quot;, &quot;Ciao, Ciao, Bambina&quot;, &quot;Arrivederci, Roma&quot;, and &quot;O Sole Mio&quot;. His renditions of &quot;Volare&quot;, &quot;Innamorata (Sweetheart)&quot;, and &quot;Al di là&quot; became classic Italian-American songs.

==Early life==
Vale was born Gennaro Louis Vitaliano in the Bronx, New York, to Italian immigrant parents and grew up in the Wakefield section of the Bronx, which at the time was composed mainly of Italian-American families. In high school, to earn money, Vale took a job shining shoes in a barbershop, singing while he worked. His boss, Vito Veneziano, liked the sound so well that he paid for music lessons for the boy. Vale started singing in high school musicals and at a local nightclub. Still a teenager, he left school to work in a factory as an oiler alongside his father.

==Career==
Vale&#x27;s early nightclub performances led to additional shows in the early 1950s, including one lasting for three years at the Enchanted Room, a club in Yonkers, New York. When Paul Insetta (road manager for singer Guy Mitchell and hit songwriter) heard him there, he signed him to a management contract and further coached him. Insetta arranged for Vale to record some demonstration records of songs he&#x27;d written, and he brought them to Columbia Records. Guy Mitchell introduced Vale to Mitch Miller, then head of A&amp;R at Columbia Records. Vale signed a recording contract, with Insetta as his manager for many years to come.

Jerry Vale appeared on the Ted Mack Amateur Hour in 1950 singing &quot;It Isn&#x27;t Fair&quot;.

Vale&#x27;s first recording with the Columbia label, with accompaniment by Percy Faith and his band, was &quot;You Can Never Give Me Back My Heart&quot;, reached No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, becoming Vale&#x27;s first U.S. hit.

His version of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, recorded in late 1963, was a fixture at many sporting events for years, and the gold record Vale received was displayed at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. Vale frequently sang the song at Yankee Stadium. Additionally, he owned the Daytona Beach Admirals.

He sang the &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; anthem &quot;It&#x27;s A Late Night World&quot; on the program&#x27;s eighth anniversary special in 1990. He made cameo appearances as himself in the 1990 film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and the 1995 film &quot;Casino&quot;, both directed by Martin Scorsese.

Vale reportedly suffered a stroke in 2002 and did not perform in his later years.

==Personal life==
In 1959, Vale married Rita Grapel, an actress. His biography &quot;A Singer&#x27;s Life&quot;, by Richard Grudens, was published in 2000 by Celebrity Profiles.

==Death==
Jerry Vale died of natural causes in his sleep on May 18, 2014, at his home in Palm Desert, California. Vale was 83 years old. He and his wife had two children, Robert Vale and Pamela Vale Branch. He is interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery, in Cathedral City, California.

==In popular culture==
As an actor, Vale appeared as himself in the films &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;Casino&quot; as well as in television series such as &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Midnight Caller&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s The Boss&quot; and &quot;Growing Pains&quot;.

In the 2016 Disney animated film &quot;Zootopia&quot;, there is a parody of Vale named Jerry Vole. 

Vale is portrayed by Steven Van Zandt in the 2019 film &quot;The Irishman&quot;.

==Honors==
In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to Vale.

<doc id="564098" wikidata="Q367706" url="?curid=564098" title="USS Pittsburgh (CA-72)">
<text>USS &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; (CA-72), originally named USS &quot;Albany&quot; (CA-72), was a heavy cruiser of the US Navy and the third ship to bear the name. She was laid down on 3 February 1943 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard at Quincy, Massachusetts, launched on 22 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Cornelius D. Scully, wife of the Mayor of Pittsburgh and commissioned in Boston, Massachusetts on 10 October 1944, with Capt. John Edward Gingrich in command.

==Service history==

===World War II, 1944–1945===
&quot;Pittsburgh&quot; worked up along the East Coast and in the Caribbean before departing from Boston, Massachusetts on 13 January 1945 for duty in the Pacific theatre of operations. After calling at Panama and final gunnery exercises around the Hawaiian Islands, she was assigned to Fast Carrier Task Force 58 (TF 58), built around the aircraft carrier , at Ulithi on 13 February.

====Iwo Jima====
The force sailed on 10 February for the assault on Iwo Jima, conducting carrier airstrikes against airfields near Tokyo on 16 and 17 February which restricted the Japanese air response to the initial landings on 19 February. Further strikes against Tokyo on 25 February and Ryukyu Islands on 1 March complemented these actions.

The task force sailed from Ulithi on 14 March to shell airfields and other military installations on Kyūshū on 18 and 19 March. The next day, a Japanese aircraft hit the aircraft carrier with two 250 kg bombs, setting the fueled and armed aircraft on her flight deck on fire, and she lost all power. &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; came alongside and rescued 34 men from the water and with the light cruisers , and managed to get a tow line on board the carrier to begin the task of towing the carrier. The cruiser continued her effort until midday on 20 March when &quot;Franklin&quot; was able to cast off the tow and proceed under her own power. Capt. Gingrich remained on the bridge for 48 hours during this time.

====Okinawa====
Between 23 March and 27 April, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; guarded the carriers as they first prepared, covered and supported the invasion of Okinawa. Enemy airfields were interdicted, and the troops given close air support by the carriers. &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; helped repel enemy air attacks and launched her scout planes to rescue downed pilots. After replenishing at Ulithi, the force sailed on 8 May to attack the Ryukyu Islands and Southern Japan.

====Damaged by a typhoon====

On 4 June, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; was caught in Typhoon Viper which increased to winds and waves. Her starboard scout plane was lifted off its catapult and dashed onto the deck by the wind, then shortly after her second deck buckled. Her bow was thrust upward, then sheared off, but there were no casualties. Still fighting the storm, and maneuvering to avoid being hit by her drifting bow structure, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; was held quarter-on to the seas by her engine power while the forward bulkhead was shored. After a seven-hour battle, the storm subsided, and &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; proceeded at to Guam, arriving on 10 June. Her bow, nicknamed &quot;McKeesport&quot; (a suburb of Pittsburgh), was later salvaged by the tugboat and brought into Guam. The 104-foot section of bow broke off owing to poor plate welds at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co. at the Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts. The typhoon damage also earned her the nickname &quot;Longest Ship in the World&quot; as thousands of miles separated the bow and stern.

With a false bow, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; left Guam on 24 June for Puget Sound Navy Yard, arriving 16 July. Still under repair at war&#x27;s end, she was placed in reserve on 12 March 1946 and decommissioned on 7 March 1947.

===Atlantic and Mediterranean, 1951–1954===

As the Korean War called for a major restoration of US naval strength, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; was recommissioned on 25 September 1951, with Capt. Preston V. Mercer in command. She sailed on 20 October for the Panama Canal, worked up out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and prepared at Norfolk, Virginia for a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet sailing on 11 February 1952. Returning on 20 May, she joined in the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s schedule of exercises and special operations in the western Atlantic and Caribbean. At this time her captain was P D Gallery.

During her second Mediterranean tour of duty, sailing on 1 December, she flew the flag of Vice Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander in Chief, Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, for a good-will cruise to the Indian Ocean in January 1953. She returned to Norfolk in May for a major modernization overhaul, before rejoined the 6th Fleet at Gibraltar on 19 January 1954. Once again she carried Admiral Wright to ports of the Indian Ocean, returning to Norfolk on 26 May. During the summer of 1954, she engaged in further operations along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. On 29 July 1954, &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; collided with another ship while sailing in the Saint Lawrence River. Damage to the hull was above the waterline and the holes were repaired.

===Pacific, 1954–1956===
On 21 October 1954, she passed through the Panama Canal to join the Pacific Fleet, with Long Beach as her home port. She sailed for the Far East, calling at Pearl Harbor on 13 November and reaching Yokosuka on 26 November. She joined the 7th Fleet helping to cover the Chinese Nationalist defense of the Dachen Islands and evacuation of civilians and non-essential military personnel. Leaving Japan on 16 February 1955, she resumed course for the west coast before reporting to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 28 October to be deactivated.

===Decommissioning and sale, 1956–1974===

&quot;Pittsburgh&quot; went into reserve on 28 April 1956, and was decommissioned at Bremerton on 28 August 1956. The ship remained there until stricken on 1 July 1973 and sold for scrap on 1 August 1974, to the Zidell Explorations Corp., Portland, Oregon.
An anchor from USS &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; is on display in front of the Children&#x27;s Museum at Allegheny Center in Pittsburgh, and the ship&#x27;s bell is on display in front of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum.

== Awards ==
&quot;Pittsburgh&quot; received two battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="564099" wikidata="Q180560" url="?curid=564099" title="Philip Seymour Hoffman">
<text>Philip Seymour Hoffman (July 23, 1967 – February 2, 2014) was an American actor. Known for his distinctive supporting and character roles—eccentrics, underdogs, and misfits—he acted in many films and theatrical productions, including leading roles, from the early 1990s until his death in 2014. He was voted the greatest actor of the 21st century in a 2024 ranking by &quot;The Independent&quot;.

Hoffman studied acting at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts. He gained recognition for his supporting work, notably in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992), &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), &quot;Happiness&quot; (1998), &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998), &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999), &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), and &quot;Almost Famous&quot; (2000). He began to occasionally play leading roles, and for his portrayal of the author Truman Capote in &quot;Capote&quot; (2005), won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Further Oscar nominations came for playing a brutally frank CIA officer in &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; (2007), a priest accused of child sexual abuse in &quot;Doubt&quot; (2008), and the charismatic leader of a Scientology-type movement in &quot;The Master&quot; (2012).

While he mainly worked in independent films, including &quot;The Savages&quot; (2007) and &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2008), Hoffman also appeared in Hollywood blockbusters, such as &quot;Twister&quot; (1996) and &quot;&quot; (2006). He played Plutarch Heavensbee in the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; series (2013–2015), in one of his final roles. The feature &quot;Jack Goes Boating&quot; (2010) marked his debut as a filmmaker. Hoffman was also an accomplished theater actor and director. He joined the off-Broadway LAByrinth Theater Company in 1995, where he directed, produced, and appeared in numerous stage productions. Hoffman received Tony Award nominations for his performances in the Broadway revivals of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;True West&quot; (2000), Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (2003), and Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (2012).

Hoffman struggled with drug addiction as a young adult and relapsed in 2012 after many years of abstinence. In February 2014, he died of combined drug intoxication. Remembered for the nuance, depth, and humanity he brought to his diverse roles, Hoffman was described in his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;perhaps the most ambitious and widely admired American actor of his generation&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Philip Hoffman was born on July 23, 1967, in the Rochester suburb of Fairport, New York. His mother, Marilyn O&#x27;Connor (née Loucks), came from nearby Waterloo and worked as an elementary school teacher before becoming a lawyer and eventually a family court judge. His father, Gordon Stowell Hoffman, was a native of Geneva, New York, and worked for the Xerox Corporation. Hoffman had one brother, Gordy, and two sisters, Jill and Emily. His ancestry included Irish and German.

Hoffman was baptized a Catholic and attended Mass as a child, but did not have a heavily religious upbringing. His parents divorced when he was nine, and the children were raised primarily by their mother. Hoffman&#x27;s childhood passion was sports, particularly wrestling and baseball, but at age 12, he attended a stage production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot; and was transfixed. He recalled in 2008, &quot;I was changed—permanently changed—by that experience. It was like a miracle to me.&quot; Hoffman developed a love for the theater, and proceeded to attend regularly with his mother, who was a lifelong enthusiast. He remembered that productions of &quot;Quilters&quot; and &quot;Alms for the Middle Class&quot;, the latter starring a teenaged Robert Downey Jr. were also particularly inspirational. At age 14, Hoffman suffered a neck injury that ended his sporting activity, and he began to consider acting. Encouraged by his mother, he joined a drama club, and initially committed to it because he was attracted to a female member.

Acting gradually became a passion for Hoffman: &quot;I loved the camaraderie of it, the people, and that&#x27;s when I decided it was what I wanted to do.&quot; At age 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs, where he met his future collaborators Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Miller later commented on Hoffman&#x27;s popularity at the time: &quot;We were attracted to the fact that he was genuinely serious about what he was doing. Even then, he was passionate.&quot; Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to New York University&#x27;s (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. Between graduating from Fairport High School and beginning the program, he continued his training at the Circle in the Square Theatre&#x27;s summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an usher. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989.

==Career==
===1991–1995: Early career ===
After graduating, Hoffman worked in off-Broadway theater and made additional money with customer service jobs. He made his screen debut in 1991, in a &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; episode called &quot;The Violence of Summer&quot;, playing a man accused of rape. He made his film debut the following year, when he was credited as &quot;Phil Hoffman&quot; in the independent film &quot;Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole&quot;. After this, he adopted his grandfather&#x27;s name, Seymour, to avoid confusion with another actor. 

More film roles promptly followed, with appearances in the studio production &quot;My New Gun&quot;, and a small role in the comedy &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;, starring Steve Martin. Following these roles, he gained attention playing a spoiled private school student in the Oscar-winning Al Pacino film &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992). Hoffman auditioned five times for his role, which &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Ryan Gilbey says gave him an early opportunity &quot;to indulge his skill for making unctuousness compelling&quot;. The film earned US$134 million worldwide and was the first to get Hoffman noticed. Reflecting on &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, Hoffman later said, &quot;If I hadn&#x27;t gotten into that film, I wouldn&#x27;t be where I am today.&quot; At this time, he quit his job in a delicatessen to become a professional actor.

Hoffman continued playing small roles throughout the early 1990s. After appearing in &quot;Joey Breaker&quot; and the critically panned teen zombie picture &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot;, he had a more notable role playing John Cusack&#x27;s wealthy friend in the crime comedy &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;. In 1994, he portrayed an inexperienced mobster in the crime thriller &quot;The Getaway&quot;, starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, and he subsequently appeared with Andy García and Meg Ryan in the romantic drama &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;. He then played an uptight police deputy who gets punched by Paul Newman—one of Hoffman&#x27;s acting idols—in the drama &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;.

Still considering stage work to be fundamental to his career, Hoffman joined the LAByrinth Theater Company of New York City in 1995. This association lasted the remainder of his life; along with appearing in multiple productions, he later became co-artistic director of the theater company with John Ortiz, and directed various plays over the years. Hoffman&#x27;s only film appearance of 1995 was in the 22-minute short comedy &quot;The Fifteen Minute Hamlet&quot;, which satirized the film industry in an Elizabethan setting. He played the characters of Bernardo, Horatio, and Laertes alongside Austin Pendleton&#x27;s Hamlet.

===1996–1999: Rising star ===
Between April and May 1996, Hoffman appeared at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in a Mark Wing-Davey production of Caryl Churchill&#x27;s &quot;The Skriker&quot;. Afterwards, based on his work in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, he was cast by writer–director Paul Thomas Anderson to appear in Anderson&#x27;s debut feature &quot;Hard Eight&quot; (1996). Hoffman had only a brief role in the crime thriller, playing a cocksure young craps player, but it began the most important collaboration of his career.
Before cementing a creative partnership with Anderson, Hoffman appeared in one of the year&#x27;s biggest blockbusters, Twister, playing a grubby, hyperactive storm chaser alongside Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. According to a &quot;People&quot; survey of Twitter and Facebook users, &quot;Twister&quot; is the film with which Hoffman is most popularly associated. He then reunited with Anderson for the director&#x27;s second feature, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, about the Golden Age of Pornography. The ensemble piece starred Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds; Hoffman played a boom operator, described by David Fear of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a &quot;complete, unabashed loser&quot;, who attempts to seduce Wahlberg&#x27;s character. Warmly received by critics, the film grew into a cult classic, and has been cited as the role in which Hoffman first showed his full ability. Fear commended the &quot;naked emotional neediness&quot; of the performance, adding that it made for compulsive viewing. Hoffman later expressed his appreciation for Anderson when he called the director &quot;incomparable&quot;.

Continuing with this momentum, Hoffman appeared in five films in 1998. He had supporting roles in the crime thriller &quot;Montana&quot; and the romantic comedy &quot;Next Stop Wonderland&quot;, both of which were commercial failures, before working with the Coen brothers in their dark comedy &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. Hoffman had long been a fan of the directors, and relished the experience of working with them. Appearing alongside Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, Hoffman played Brandt, the smug personal assistant of the titular character. Although it was only a small role, he said it was one for which he was most recognized, in a film that has achieved cult status and a large fan base. Between March and April 1998, Hoffman made 30 appearances on stage at the New York Theatre Workshop in a production of Mark Ravenhill&#x27;s &quot;Shopping and Fucking&quot;, portraying an ex-heroin addict.

Hoffman took an unflattering role in Todd Solondz&#x27;s &quot;Happiness&quot; (1998), a misanthropic black comedy about the lives of three sisters and those around them. He played Allen, a sexually frustrated loner who makes obscene phone calls to women; the character furiously masturbates during one conversation, producing what film scholar Jerry Mosher calls an &quot;embarrassingly raw performance&quot;. Jake Coyle of the Associated Press rated Allen as &quot;one of the creepiest characters in American movies&quot;, but critic Xan Brooks highlighted the pathos that Hoffman brought to the role. &quot;Happiness&quot; was controversial but widely praised, and Hoffman&#x27;s role has been cited by critics as one of his best. His final 1998 release was more mainstream, appeared as a medical student in the Robin Williams comedy &quot;Patch Adams&quot;. The film was critically panned, but one of the highest-grossing of Hoffman&#x27;s career.

In 1999, Hoffman starred opposite Robert De Niro as drag queen Rusty Zimmerman in Joel Schumacher&#x27;s drama &quot;Flawless&quot;. Hoffman considered De Niro the most imposing actor with whom he had appeared, and he felt that working with the veteran performer profoundly improved his own acting. Hoffman&#x27;s ability to avoid clichés in playing such a delicate role was noted by critics, and Roger Ebert said it confirmed him as &quot;one of the best new character actors&quot;. He was rewarded with his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. Hoffman then reunited with Paul Thomas Anderson, where he was given an atypically virtuous role in the ensemble drama &quot;Magnolia&quot;. The film, set over one day in Los Angeles, features Hoffman as a nurse who cares for Jason Robards&#x27; character, who is dying of cancer. The performance was approved of by the medical industry, and Jessica Winter of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; considered it Hoffman&#x27;s most indelible work, likening him to a guardian angel. &quot;Magnolia&quot; has been included in lists of the greatest films of all time, and it was a personal favorite of Hoffman&#x27;s.

One of the most critically and commercially successful films of Hoffman&#x27;s career was &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), which he considered &quot;as edgy as you can get for a Hollywood movie&quot;. He played a &quot;preppy bully&quot; who taunts Matt Damon&#x27;s Tom Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; called &quot;the truest upper class twit in all of American movies&quot;. Hoffman&#x27;s performance won praise from Meryl Streep, another of his cinematic idols: &quot;I sat up straight in my seat and said, &#x27;Who is that?&#x27; I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless,&quot; she said. &quot;He&#x27;s done what we all strive for — he&#x27;s given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he&#x27;s made him fascinating.&quot; In recognition of his work in &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, Hoffman was named the year&#x27;s Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review.

===2000–2004: Established star ===

Following a string of roles in successful films in the late 1990s, Hoffman had established a reputation as a top supporting player who could be relied on to make an impression with each performance. His film appearances were likened by David Kamp of &quot;GQ&quot; to &quot;discovering a prize in a box of cereal, receiving a bonus, or bumping unexpectedly into an old friend&quot;. According to Jerry Mosher, as the year 2000 began, &quot;it seemed Hoffman was everywhere, poised on the cusp of stardom&quot;.

Hoffman had begun to be recognized as a theater actor in 1999, when he received a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Featured Actor for the off-Broadway play &quot;The Author&#x27;s Voice&quot;. This success continued with the 2000 Broadway revival of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;True West&quot;, where Hoffman alternated roles nightly with co-star John C. Reilly, making 154 appearances between March and July 2000. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that it was the best stage performance of Hoffman&#x27;s career, calling him &quot;brilliant&quot;, and the actor earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Play. The following year, Hoffman appeared with Meryl Streep, Natalie Portman, and John Goodman in a Delacorte Theater production of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;—although Brantley felt that this performance was less fully realized. As a stage director, Hoffman received two Drama Desk Award nominations for Outstanding Director of a Play: one for &quot;Jesus Hopped the &#x27;A&#x27; Train&quot; in 2001, and another for &quot;Our Lady of 121st Street&quot; in 2003. In a 2008 interview, Hoffman opined that &quot;switching hats&quot; between acting and directing helped him improve in both roles.

David Mamet&#x27;s comedy &quot;State and Main&quot;, about the difficulties of shooting a film in rural New England, was Hoffman&#x27;s first film role of 2000 and had a limited release. He had a more prominent supporting role that year in &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, Cameron Crowe&#x27;s popular coming-of-age film set in the 1970s music industry. Hoffman portrayed the enthusiastic rock critic Lester Bangs, a task by which he felt burdened, but he managed to convey the real figure&#x27;s mannerisms and sharp wit after watching him in a BBC interview. The following year, Hoffman featured as the narrator and interviewer in &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot;, a documentary about the 2000 U.S. elections. He assumed the position of a &quot;politically informed and alienated Generation-Xer&quot; who seeks to be educated in U.S. politics, but ultimately reveals the extent of public dissatisfaction in this area.

In 2002, Hoffman was given his first leading role (despite joking at the time &quot;Even if I was hired into a leading-man part, I&#x27;d probably turn it into the non-leading-man part&quot;) in Todd Louiso&#x27;s tragicomedy &quot;Love Liza&quot; (2002). His brother Gordy wrote the script, which Hoffman had seen at their mother&#x27;s house five years earlier, about a widower who starts sniffing gasoline to cope with his wife&#x27;s suicide. He considered it the finest piece of writing he had ever read, &quot;incredibly humble in its exploration of grief&quot;, but critics were less enthusiastic about the production. A review for the BBC wrote that Hoffman had finally been given a part that showed &quot;what he&#x27;s truly capable of&quot;, but few witnessed this as the film had a limited release and earned only US$210,000.

Later in 2002, Hoffman starred opposite Adam Sandler and Emily Watson in Anderson&#x27;s critically acclaimed fourth picture, the surrealist romantic comedy-drama &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; (2002), where he played an illegal phone-sex &quot;supervisor&quot;. Drew Hunt of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; saw the performance as a fine example of Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;knack for turning small roles into seminal performances&quot; and praised the actor&#x27;s comedic ability. In a very different film, Hoffman was next seen with Anthony Hopkins in the high-budget thriller &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, a prequel to &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, portraying the meddlesome tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds. His fourth appearance of 2002 came in Spike Lee&#x27;s drama &quot;25th Hour&quot;, playing an English teacher who makes a devastating drunken mistake. Both Lee and the film&#x27;s lead Edward Norton were thrilled to work with Hoffman, and Lee confessed that he had long wanted to do a picture with the actor, but had waited until he found the right role. Hoffman considered his character, Jakob, to be one of the most reticent characters he had ever played, a straight-laced &quot;corduroy-pants-wearing kind of guy.&quot; Roger Ebert promoted &quot;25th Hour&quot; to one of his &quot;Great Movies&quot; in 2009, and along with A. O. Scott, considered it to be one of the best films of the 2000s.

The drama &quot;Owning Mahowny&quot; (2003) gave Hoffman his second lead role, starring opposite Minnie Driver as a bank employee who embezzles money to feed his gambling addiction. It was based on the true story of Toronto banker Brian Molony, who committed the largest fraud in Canadian history. , Hoffman met with Molony to prepare for the role and help him play the character as accurately as possible. He was determined not to conform to &quot;movie character&quot; stereotypes, and his portrayal of addiction won approval from the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Roger Ebert assessed Hoffman&#x27;s performance as &quot;a masterpiece of discipline and precision,&quot; but the film earned little at the box office.

Hoffman&#x27;s second 2003 appearance was a small role in Anthony Minghella&#x27;s successful Civil War epic &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;. He played an immoral preacher, a complex character that Hoffman described as a &quot;mass of contradictions&quot;. The same year, from April to August, he appeared with Vanessa Redgrave, Brian Dennehy, and Robert Sean Leonard in a Broadway revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;. Director Robert Falls later commented on the dedication and experience that Hoffman brought to his role of alcoholic Jamie Tyrone: &quot;Every night he ripped it up to an extent that he couldn&#x27;t leave [the role]. Phil carried it with him.&quot; Hoffman received his second Tony Award nomination, this time for Best Featured Actor in a Play. In 2004, he appeared as the crude, has-been actor friend of Ben Stiller&#x27;s character in the box-office hit &quot;Along Came Polly&quot;. Reflecting on the role, &quot;People&quot; said it proved that &quot;Hoffman could deliver comedic performances with the best of them&quot;.

===2005–2009: Critical acclaim===
A turning point in Hoffman&#x27;s career came with the biographical film &quot;Capote&quot; (2005), which dramatized Truman Capote&#x27;s experience of writing his true crime novel &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1966). Hoffman took the title role for a project that he co-produced and helped bring to fruition. Portraying the idiosyncratic writer proved highly demanding, requiring significant weight loss and four months of research—such as watching video clips of Capote to help him affect the author&#x27;s effeminate voice and mannerisms. Hoffman stated that he was not concerned with perfectly imitating Capote&#x27;s speech, but he did feel a great duty to &quot;express the vitality and the nuances&quot; of the writer. During filming, he stayed in character constantly so as not to lose the voice and posture: &quot;Otherwise,&quot; he explained, &quot;I would give my body a chance to bail on me.&quot; &quot;Capote&quot; was released to great acclaim, particularly regarding Hoffman&#x27;s performance. Many critics commented that the role was designed to win awards, and indeed Hoffman received an Oscar, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild Award, BAFTA, and various other critics&#x27; awards. In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; listed his role in &quot;Capote&quot; as the 35th-greatest movie performance of all time. After the film, several commentators began to describe Hoffman as one of the finest, most ambitious actors of his generation.

Hoffman received his only Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his supporting role in the HBO miniseries &quot;Empire Falls&quot; (2005), about life in a New England town. He ultimately lost to castmate Paul Newman. In 2006, he appeared in the summer blockbuster &quot;&quot;, playing the villainous arms dealer Owen Davian opposite Tom Cruise. A journalist for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; stated that Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;black-hat performance was one of the most delicious in a Hollywood film since Alan Rickman&#x27;s in &quot;Die Hard&quot; &quot;, and he was generally approved of for bringing gravitas to the action film. With a gross of nearly US$400 million, it exposed Hoffman to a mainstream audience.

Returning to independent films in 2007, Hoffman began with a starring role in Tamara Jenkins&#x27;s &quot;The Savages&quot;, where Laura Linney and he played siblings responsible for putting their dementia-ridden father (Philip Bosco) in a care home. Jake Coyle of the Associated Press stated that it was &quot;the epitome of a Hoffman film: a mix of comedy and tragedy told with subtlety, bone-dry humor, and flashes of grace&quot;. Hoffman received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in &quot;The Savages&quot;. He next appeared in &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#x27;re Dead&quot;, the final film by veteran director Sidney Lumet, where he played a realtor who embezzles funds from his employer to support his drug habit. Mosher comments that the character was one of the most unpleasant of Hoffman&#x27;s career, but that his &quot;fearlessness again revealed the humanity within a deeply flawed character&quot; as he appeared naked in the opening sex scene. The film was received positively by critics as a powerful and affecting thriller.

Mike Nichols&#x27;s political film &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; (2007) gave Hoffman his second Academy Award nomination, again for playing a real individual—Gust Avrakotos, the CIA officer who worked with Congressman Charlie Wilson (played by Tom Hanks) to aid the Afghan Mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet Union. Todd McCarthy wrote of Hoffman&#x27;s performance: &quot;Decked out with a pouffy &#x27;80s hairdo, moustache, protruding gut and ever-present smokes ... whenever he&#x27;s on, the picture vibrates with conspiratorial electricity.&quot; The film was a critical and commercial success, and along with his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, Hoffman was nominated for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe Award.

The year 2008 contained two significant Hoffman roles. In Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s enigmatic drama &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;, he starred as Caden Cotard, a frustrated dramatist who attempts to build a scale replica of New York inside a warehouse for a play. Hoffman again showed his willingness to reveal unattractive traits, as the character ages and deteriorates, and committed to a deeply psychological role. Critics were divided in their response to the &quot;ambitious and baffling&quot; film. Sonny Bunch of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; found it &quot;impressionistic, inaccessible, and endlessly frustrating&quot;, likening Hoffman&#x27;s character to &quot;God, if God lacked imagination&quot;. Conversely, Roger Ebert named it the best film of the decade and considered it one of the greatest of all time, and Robbie Collin, film critic for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, believes Hoffman gave one of cinema&#x27;s best performances.

Hoffman&#x27;s second role of the year came opposite Meryl Streep and Amy Adams in John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s &quot;Doubt&quot;, where he played Father Brendan Flynn—a priest accused of sexually abusing a 12-year-old African-American student in the 1960s. Hoffman was already familiar with the play and appreciated the opportunity to bring it to the screen; in preparing for the role, he talked extensively to a priest who lived through the era. The film had a mixed reception, with some critics such as Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; suspicious of it as Oscar bait, but Hoffman gained second consecutive Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, and was also nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.

On stage in 2009, Hoffman played Iago in Peter Sellars&#x27; futuristic production of &quot;Othello&quot; (with the title role by John Ortiz), which received mixed reviews. Ben Brantley, theatre critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found it to be &quot;exasperatingly misconceived&quot;, remarking that even when Hoffman is attempting to &quot;manipulate others into self-destruction, he comes close to spoiling everything by erupting into genuine, volcanic fury&quot;. Hoffman also did his first vocal performance for the claymation film &quot;Mary and Max&quot;, although the film did not initially have an American release. He played Max, a depressed New Yorker with Asperger syndrome, while Toni Collette voiced Mary—the Australian girl who becomes his pen pal. Continuing with animation, Hoffman then worked on an episode of the children&#x27;s show &quot;Arthur&quot; and received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Performer In An Animated Program. Later in the year, he played a brash American disc jockey opposite Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans in Richard Curtis&#x27;s British comedy &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot; (also known as &quot;Pirate Radio&quot;)—a character based on Emperor Rosko, a host of Radio Caroline in 1966. He also had a cameo role as a bartender in Ricky Gervais&#x27;s &quot;The Invention of Lying&quot;.

Reflecting on Hoffman&#x27;s work in the late 2000s, Mosher writes that the actor remained impressive, but had not delivered a testing performance on the level of his work in &quot;Capote&quot;. The film critic David Thomson believed that Hoffman showed indecisiveness at this time, unsure whether to play spectacular supporting roles or become a lead actor who is capable of controlling the emotional dynamic and outcome of a film.

===2010–2014: Final years ===
Hoffman&#x27;s profile continued to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure. Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The independent drama &quot;Jack Goes Boating&quot; was adapted from Robert Glaudini&#x27;s play of the same name, which Hoffman had starred in and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended to only direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack—a lonely limousine driver looking for love—after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable. The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, though it received many positive reviews. However, Dave Edwards of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; remarked that &quot;Hoffman&#x27;s directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely remember what it was about as I left&quot;, while critic Mark Kermode appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director. In addition to &quot;Jack Goes Boating&quot;, in 2010 Hoffman also directed Brett C. Leonard&#x27;s tragic drama &quot;The Long Red Road&quot; for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Steven Oxman of &quot;Variety&quot; described the production as &quot;heavy handed&quot; and &quot;predictable&quot;, but &quot;intriguing and at least partially successful&quot;.

Hoffman next had significant supporting roles in two films, both released in the last third of 2011. In Bennett Miller&#x27;s &quot;Moneyball&quot;, a sports drama about the 2002 season of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, he played the manager Art Howe. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Hoffman was described as &quot;perfectly cast&quot; by Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, but the real-life Art Howe accused the filmmakers of giving an &quot;unfair and untrue&quot; portrayal of him. Hoffman&#x27;s second film of the year was George Clooney&#x27;s political drama &quot;The Ides of March&quot;, in which he played the earnest campaign manager to the Democratic presidential candidate Mike Morris (Clooney). The film was well-received and Hoffman&#x27;s performance, especially in the scenes opposite Paul Giamatti—who played the rival campaign manager—was positively noted. Hoffman&#x27;s work on the film earned him his fourth BAFTA Award nomination.

In the spring of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, starring as Willy Loman in a Broadway revival of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; opposite Andrew Garfield. Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the Ethel Barrymore Theatre&#x27;s history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was too young for the role of 62-year-old Loman, and Chris Jones of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted that he found the role difficult, but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.

Hoffman collaborated with Paul Thomas Anderson for the fifth time in &quot;The Master&quot; (2012), where he turned in what critic Peter Bradshaw considered the most memorable performance of his career. Set in 1950s America, the film featured Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd, the charismatic leader of a nascent Scientology-type movement who brings a troubled man (Joaquin Phoenix) under his tutelage. Hoffman was instrumental in the project&#x27;s development, having been involved with it for three years. He assisted Anderson in the writing of the script by reviewing samples of it, and suggested making Phoenix&#x27;s character, Freddie Quell, the protagonist instead of Dodd. A talented dancer, Hoffman was able to showcase his abilities by performing a jig during a surreal sequence; Bradshaw called it an &quot;extraordinary moment&quot; that &quot;only Hoffman could have carried off.&quot; &quot;The Master&quot; was praised as an intelligent and challenging drama, and Drew Hunt of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; also felt that it contained Hoffman&#x27;s finest work: &quot;He&#x27;s inscrutable yet welcoming, intimidating yet charismatic, villainous yet fatherly. He epitomizes so many things at once that it&#x27;s impossible to think of [Dodd] as mere movie character&quot;. Hoffman and Phoenix received a joint Volpi Cup Award at the Venice Film Festival for their performances, and Hoffman was also nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA Award and a SAG Award for the supporting role.

&quot;A Late Quartet&quot; was Hoffman&#x27;s other film release of 2012, where he played a violinist in a string quartet whose members (played by Christopher Walken, Catherine Keener, and Mark Ivanir) face a crisis when one is diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The drama received favorable reviews, and Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Hoffman&#x27;s performance &quot;exceptional&quot;. In 2013, Hoffman joined the popular &quot;Hunger Games&quot; series in its second film, &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot;, where he played gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. The film finished as the 10th-highest grossing in history to that point, and Hoffman became recognizable to a new generation of film-goers. In January 2014, shortly before his death, he attended the Sundance Film Festival to promote two films. In Anton Corbijn&#x27;s &quot;A Most Wanted Man&quot;, a thriller based on John le Carré&#x27;s novel, Hoffman played a German intelligence officer. His performance was praised by Xan Brooks as one of &quot;terrific, lip-smacking relish: full of mischief, anchored by integrity.&quot; The other was &quot;God&#x27;s Pocket&quot;, the directorial debut of actor John Slattery, in which Hoffman played a thief. In November 2014, nine months after his death, &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1,&quot; was released, in which he had a major role. It was dedicated in his memory.

At the time of his death, Hoffman was filming &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2&quot;, the fourth film in the series, and had already completed the majority of his scenes. His two remaining scenes were rewritten to compensate for his absence. The film was released in November 2015. Hoffman was also preparing for his second directorial effort, a Prohibition-era drama titled &quot;Ezekiel Moss&quot;, which was to star Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal. In addition, he had filmed a pilot episode for the Showtime series &quot;Happyish&quot;, in which he played the lead role of an advertising executive. Plans for a full season were put on hold following his death. The role was later passed on to Steve Coogan.

==Personal life==
Hoffman rarely mentioned his personal life in interviews, stating in 2012 that he would &quot;rather not because my family doesn&#x27;t have any choice. If I talk about them in the press, I&#x27;m giving them no choice. So I choose not to.&quot; For 14 years, he was in a relationship with costume designer Mimi O&#x27;Donnell, whom he had met in 1999 when they were both working on the Hoffman-directed play &quot;In Arabia We&#x27;d All Be Kings&quot;. They lived in New York City and had a son, Cooper, and two daughters. While some reports stated Hoffman and O&#x27;Donnell separated in late 2013, O&#x27;Donnell later said she and Hoffman were both committed to their relationship, but he had moved out of their longtime residence to a nearby apartment to protect their children from the effects of his relapse into substance abuse.

He felt that keeping his personal life private was beneficial to his career: &quot;The less you know about me the more interesting it will be to watch me do what I do&quot;. Hoffman was also discreet about his religious and political beliefs, but it is known that he voted for the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. He also donated to Al Franken&#x27;s senate campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

In a 2006 interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Hoffman revealed he had engaged in drug and alcohol misuse during his time at New York University, saying he had used &quot;anything I could get my hands on. I liked it all.&quot; Following his graduation in 1989, he entered a drug rehabilitation program at age 22, and remained sober for 23 years. However, he relapsed in 2012, and admitted himself to drug rehabilitation for about ten days in May 2013.

==Death==
On February 2, 2014, Hoffman was found dead in the bathroom of his Manhattan apartment by his friend, playwright and screenwriter David Bar Katz. He was 46 years old. Although friends stated that Hoffman&#x27;s drug use was under control at the time, detectives searching the apartment found heroin and prescription medication at the scene and revealed that he had a syringe in his arm. Hoffman&#x27;s death was officially ruled an accident caused by &quot;acute mixed drug intoxication, including heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and amphetamine&quot;. Michael Schwirtz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Whether Hoffman had taken all of the substances on the same day, or whether any of the substances had remained in his system from earlier use, was not reported.&quot;

A funeral Mass was held at St. Ignatius Loyola Church in Manhattan on February 7, 2014, and was attended by many of his close friends and former co-stars, including Amy Adams, Cate Blanchett, Ellen Burstyn, Louis C.K., Ethan Hawke, Laura Linney, Julianne Moore, Paul Thomas Anderson, Mike Nichols, Joaquin Phoenix, John C. Reilly, Michelle Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Diane Sawyer, Ben Stiller, Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton, Marisa Tomei, Maya Rudolph, Brian Dennehy, Sam Rockwell, Josh Hamilton, Justin Theroux, Chris Rock and Eric Bogosian .

After the Mass, Hoffman&#x27;s body was taken to be cremated, with his ashes given to his partner and children. He left his fortune of around $35 million to Mimi O&#x27;Donnell in his October 2004 will, trusting her to distribute money to their children.

Hoffman&#x27;s death was lamented by fans and the film industry and was described by several commentators as a considerable loss to the profession. On February 5, 2014, the LAByrinth Theatre Company honored his memory by holding a candlelight vigil, and Broadway dimmed its lights for one minute. Three weeks after Hoffman&#x27;s death, Katz established the American Playwriting Foundation in Hoffman&#x27;s memory. With the money received from a libel lawsuit against the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; which inaccurately claimed that Hoffman and Katz were lovers, the foundation awards an annual prize of $45,000 to the author of an unproduced play. Katz named this the &quot;Relentless Prize&quot; in honor of Hoffman&#x27;s dedication to the profession. He would later remember Hoffman with a poem published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in December 2014. In tribute, actress Cate Blanchett dedicated her BAFTA trophy to Hoffman when she received the award for &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; on February 16. Years later, at the 90th Academy Awards, &quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&quot; actor Sam Rockwell dedicated his win for Best Supporting Actor to Hoffman.

==Reception and acting style==
Hoffman was held in high regard within both the film and theater industries, and he was often cited in the media as one of the finest actors of his generation. In a 2022 readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, he was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time. One writer described Hoffman as &quot;too pudgy to look romantic or heroic&quot;; however, the actor said he was grateful for his appearance, as it made him believable in a wide range of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, &quot;The bad news is that Philip won&#x27;t be a $25-million star. The good news is that he&#x27;ll work for the rest of his life&quot;. The &quot;Aiken Standard&quot; of South Carolina referred to him as an &quot;anti-star&quot;, whose real identity remained &quot;amorphous and unmoored&quot;. Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, &quot;I&#x27;m sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don&#x27;t know quite what to do with someone like me, but that&#x27;s OK. I think there are other people who are interested in what I do.&quot;

Most of Hoffman&#x27;s notable roles came in independent films, including particularly original ones, but he also featured in several Hollywood blockbusters. He generally played supporting roles, appearing in both dramas and comedies, but was noted for his ability to make small parts memorable. Peter Bradshaw, film critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, felt that &quot;Almost every single one of his credits had something special about it&quot;. David Fear of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Hoffman &quot;added heft to low-budget art films, and nuance and unpredictability to blockbuster franchises. He was a transformative performer who worked from the inside out, blessed with an emotional transparency that could be overwhelming, invigorating, compelling, devastating.&quot;

Hoffman was praised for his versatility and ability to fully inhabit any role, but specialized in playing creeps and misfits: &quot;his CV was populated almost exclusively by snivelling wretches, insufferable prigs, braggarts and outright bullies&quot; writes the journalist Ryan Gilbey. Hoffman was appreciated for making these roles real, complex and even sympathetic; while Todd Louiso, director of &quot;Love Liza&quot;, believed that Hoffman connected to people on screen because he looked like an ordinary man and revealed his vulnerability. Xan Brooks of &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked that the actor&#x27;s particular talent was to &quot;take thwarted, twisted humanity and ennoble it&quot;. &quot;The more pathetic or deluded the character,&quot; writes Gilbey, &quot;the greater Hoffman&#x27;s relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of the merely monstrous.&quot; When asked in 2006 why he undertook such roles, Hoffman responded, &quot;I didn&#x27;t go out looking for negative characters; I went out looking for people who have a struggle and a fight to tackle. That&#x27;s what interests me.&quot;

===Work ethic===
The journalist Jeff Simon described Hoffman as &quot;probably the most in-demand character actor of his generation&quot;, but Hoffman said he never took it for granted that he would be offered roles. Although he worked hard and regularly, he was humble about his acting success: an anecdote went that when asked by a friend in the early 2000s if he was having any luck in his career, he quietly replied, &quot;I&#x27;m in a film, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, that has just come out.&quot; Patrick Fugit, who worked with Hoffman on &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in &quot;a school-of-hard-knocks way&quot;, remarking that &quot;there was a certain weight that came with him&quot;. Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, &quot;ultimately my main goal is to do good work. If it doesn&#x27;t pay well, so be it.&quot; He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year.

Hoffman occasionally changed his hair and lost or gained weight for parts, and he went to great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview, he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: &quot;The job isn&#x27;t difficult. Doing it well is difficult.&quot; In an earlier interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, &quot;that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it&#x27;s torturous because you know it&#x27;s a beautiful thing ... Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great—well, that&#x27;s absolutely torturous.&quot; This struggle was confirmed by the author John le Carré, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel &quot;A Most Wanted Man&quot;. While praising the actor&#x27;s intelligence and intuition, le Carré acknowledged the burden that Hoffman felt: &quot;It was painful and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing. The world was too bright for him to handle.&quot;

==Acting credits and accolades==
Hoffman appeared in 55 films and one miniseries during his screen career spanning 22 years. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for &quot;Capote&quot; (2005), and was nominated three times for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; (2007), &quot;Doubt&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Master&quot; (2012). He also received five Golden Globe Award nominations (winning one), five BAFTA Award nominations (winning one), four Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning one), and won the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival. Hoffman remained active in theater throughout his career, starring in 10 and directing 19 stage productions (predominantly in New York). He received three Tony Award nominations for his Broadway performances: two for Best Leading Actor, in &quot;True West&quot; (2000) and &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (2012), and one for Best Featured Actor in &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (2003).

In 2022, a statue of Hoffman was unveiled in his hometown of Fairport, New York. The statue was sculpted by David A. Annand and commissioned by James Declan Tobin, a film producer who befriended Hoffman&#x27;s mother at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. Originally on loan from a gallery in New York City, the statue was permanently installed outside the George Eastman Museum in 2023. Hoffman’s mother, Marilyn O&#x27;Connor, called the sculpture &quot;a loving memorial&quot; to her son.

<text>Kyle and Carrick () was one of nineteen local government districts in the Strathclyde region of Scotland from 1975 to 1996.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Kyle and Carrick was one of nineteen districts created within the region of Strathclyde. The district covered the whole area of seven former districts and parts of another two from the historic county of Ayrshire, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Ayr Burgh
*Ayr District (except the part within the designated area of Irvine New Town)
*Dalmellington District (part, being Coylton and that part of the parish of Ayr within that district - rest of district to Cumnock and Doon Valley)
*Girvan Burgh
*Girvan District
*Maybole Burgh
*Maybole District
*Prestwick Burgh
*Troon Burgh

The district bordered districts of Cunninghame, Kilmarnock &amp; Loudoun and Cumnock and Doon Valley Districts of Strathclyde to its north and east as well as Stewartry and Wigtown Districts in Dumfries &amp; Galloway.

In 1974 Alistair Irving Haughan was appointed Chief Architect of Kyle &amp; Carrick District Council, holding the post until he retired in December 1990. While Haughan was in post the work the Council undertook on the restoration of Tam o&#x27; Shanter&#x27;s bridge, the Brig O&#x27; Doon in Alloway won a Stone Federation Award.

The district was abolished in 1996 by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which replaced regions and districts with unitary council areas. South Ayrshire council area was formed with identical boundaries to Kyle and Carrick District.
==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:

==Premises==
The district council&#x27;s headquarters were in Ayr, where they established offices in Burns House in Burns Statue Square with a satellite office in a two storey, 19th century villa at 30 Miller Road.

<text>USS &quot;Portsmouth&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of . &quot;Portsmouth&quot; was laid down in 1943, launched in September 1944, and commissioned in June 1945. By the time she completed her initial sea trials, the war had ended, so her career was short and uneventful. She made three overseas cruises to visit ports in Africa and the Mediterranean Sea between 1946 and 1948 before conducting training cruises later in 1948. The following year, she was decommissioned and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, where she remained until 1970, when she was broken up.

==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Portsmouth&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-eight Bofors guns in four quadruple and six double mounts and ten Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Portsmouth&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
&quot;Portsmouth&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 28 June 1943. She was launched on 20 September 1944 and was commissioned on 25 June 1945 with the hull number CL-102. The ship then embarked on her initial shakedown cruise that took &quot;Portsmouth&quot; as far south as Cuba. She was thereafter based in Norfolk, Virginia; by that time, World War II had ended, precluding any significant wartime service. The ship was assigned to the Operational Development Force, serving with that unit into 1946. &quot;Portsmouth&quot; embarked on a goodwill cruise to visit various ports in Africa, including Cape Town, South Africa; Lagos, Nigeria; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Monrovia, Liberia; Dakar, French Senegal; and Casablanca, French Morocco. From there, she continued into the Mediterranean Sea to visit Naples and Palermo, Italy. She thereafter returned to the United States.

The ship began another cruise to the Mediterranean on 25 November. She reached Naples on 7 December and then entered the Adriatic Sea, steaming as far north as Trieste by the end of December. She patrolled the area through February 1947, during a period of tension in the region in the aftermath of World War II. In March, she spent two weeks back in Trieste, and in April, she left the Mediterranean for home. A third Mediterranean cruise began in November and concluded with her arrival in Boston on 11 March 1948. She underwent an overhaul there and then took part in routine training operations off the East Coast of the United States. During this period, she also conducted training cruises for United States Navy Reserve personnel to the Caribbean. She sailed to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a final overhaul in preparation of being reduced to the reserve fleet. She was decommissioned on 15 June 1949 and allocated to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory through 1970. She was stricken from the naval register on 1 December that year and subsequently broken up.

<doc id="564103" wikidata="Q3309221" url="?curid=564103" title="Foolscap folio">
<text>Foolscap folio, commonly contracted to foolscap or cap or folio and in short FC, is paper cut to the size of 8.5 × 13.5 in (216 × 343 mm) for printing or to 8 × 13 in (203 × 330 mm) for &quot;normal&quot; writing paper (foolscap). This was a traditional paper size used in some parts of Europe, and the British Commonwealth, before the adoption of the international standard A4 paper.

==Size==
A full (&quot;plano&quot;) foolscap paper sheet is actually in size, and a folio sheet of any type is half the base sheet size.
ª 

Ring binders or lever arch files designed to hold foolscap folios are often used to hold A4 paper (). The slightly larger size of such a binder offers greater protection to the edges of the pages it contains.

==History==
Historically, there were two prevalent foolscap folio paper sizes: British foolscap and imperial foolscap. The British foolscap measured approximately 8.0 by 13.0 inches (203 mm by 330 mm) and was widely used in the United Kingdom for official documents and administrative records. On the other hand, the imperial foolscap was slightly larger, measuring around 8.5 by 13.5 inches (216 mm by 343 mm). This larger format was preferred in some regions of the British Empire for similar purposes. Both paper sizes represented an era when handwritten records and official documentation were prevalent, but they have since faded into history, replaced by contemporary paper standards.

===Europe===
Foolscap was named after the fool&#x27;s cap and bells watermark commonly used from the 15th century onwards on paper of these dimensions. The earliest example of such paper was made in Germany in 1479. Unsubstantiated anecdotes suggest that this watermark was introduced to England in 1580 by John Spilman, a German who established a papermill at Dartford, Kent.

The general pattern of the mark was used by Dutch and English papermakers in the late 17th and 18th centuries, and as early as 1674 the term &quot;foolscap&quot; was being used to designate a specific size of paper regardless of its watermark.

Apocryphally, the Rump Parliament of 1648–1653 substituted a fool&#x27;s cap for the royal arms as a watermark on the paper used for the journals of Parliament. According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins&quot;, there is no basis in fact for this statement.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, the foolscap folio paper size is and is named (locally) &quot;oficio&quot; (&#x27;official&#x27;).

===United States===
Today in the United States, a half-foolscap sized paper for printing is standardized to , widely available and sold as &quot;legal sized paper&quot; for printing, writing, note-taking etc. A full foolscap size paper of is also widely available for arts and crafts etc. alongside the tabloid size.

In the United States in the 19th century, paper was sold either flat or folded in half. Folded foolscap was often , but smaller and larger sizes were also found. Legal foolscap of was always sold ruled and folded in half at the printers by a folding machine, resulting in a leaflet , almost the same as modern A4 paper, which is 

There were numerous other sizes with variations on the &quot;cap&quot; name:
* Flat cap (i.e. unfolded). 
* Small Flat cap (or law blank cap, corporation cap or legal cap). 
* Exchange cap – thin, highly calendered, hard and strong paper used for bills of exchange, certificates and other blanks where light weight and ability to receive hard usages was required.
* Drawing cap – cold-pressed, for making drawing books and printing imitation antique work.
* Double cap writing – for both writing and ledger papers. 
* Double foolscap. 

==F4==

F4 is a paper size . Although metric, based on the A4 paper size, and named to suggest that it is part of the official ISO 216 paper sizes, it is only a &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

It is often referred to as (metric) &quot;foolscap&quot; or &quot;folio&quot; because of its similarity to the traditional foolscap folio size of .

<text>Sir Charles John Curran (13 October 1921 – 9 January 1980) was an Irish-born British television executive and Director-General of the BBC from 1969 to 1977.

==Early years==

Curran was born in Dublin. His father, Felix Curran, was an army schoolmaster and his mother, Alicia Isabella Bruce, came from Aberdeen. Three weeks after his birth, the family moved to Aberdeen, then his family moved to Yorkshire in 1924. He was the eldest child in a family of four siblings. He attended Wath Grammar School in Rotherham, before obtaining a first-class honours degree at Magdalene College, Cambridge.

==Career==
He served in the British Indian Army from 1942 to 1945, but left to work in the BBC Talks department. He resigned following a dispute to edit the &quot;Canadian Fishing News&quot;, but he returned in 1951 to join BBC Monitoring. Subsequent posts included Secretary and Director of External Broadcasting. While Director-General, he served three terms as President of the European Broadcasting Union. He succeeded Ronnie Waldman as Managing Director of the news agency Visnews in 1977.

He was director-general of the BBC from 1 April 1969 to 30 September 1977. He was the first grammar school-educated director-general.

Following the appointment of the former Conservative minister Lord Hill as chairman of the BBC governors in 1967 (ironically, the Labour prime minister who appointed Hill, Harold Wilson, had attacked Hill&#x27;s appointment as chairman of the Independent Television Authority under a Conservative government in 1963), Curran&#x27;s arrival marked a return to a more cautious approach after the radicalism of Sir Hugh Carleton Greene.

Curran also suffered criticism from Wilson, at that time the leader of the opposition, who claimed that the documentary &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Men&quot; (1971) was biased against himself and the Labour Party, an assertion the BBC now accepts. A parallel documentary at the time on the Heath government passed without incident.

Unlike Greene, Curran allowed himself to be influenced by Mary Whitehouse. Curran issued an apology to Whitehouse after she complained about the violence at the end of part three of &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976), a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial. Philip Hinchcliffe, then series producer, was replaced after only three more serials and his successor, Graham Williams, was ordered to lighten the tone and reduce the violence and horror content.

It was under Curran that the BBC produced some of its best-loved and most consistently repeated comedy series, such as &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Porridge&quot; and the first series of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. Curran has often been blamed for an unenthusiastic and somewhat censorious attitude towards &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, but the Python team still won many of their battles with BBC officialdom. The &quot;Play for Today&quot; series continued to take risks throughout Curran&#x27;s eight years as Director-General. The &quot;Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; became one of the best-loved British TV institutions ever between 1969 and 1977, and the Curran era also saw the development of Michael Parkinson&#x27;s hugely popular Saturday-night chat show.

==Knighthood and death==

Curran was made a Knight Bachelor in 1974. Following a period of ill health, Curran died from a heart attack on 9 January 1980, aged 58. His funeral was held in Westminster Cathedral.

<text>The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) was a major British railway company before the 1923 Grouping. It was incorporated in 1847 from an amalgamation of several existing railways. It was the third-largest railway system based in northern England (after the Midland and North Eastern Railways).

The intensity of its service was reflected in the 1,650 locomotives it owned – it was by far the most densely-trafficked system in the British Isles with more locomotives per mile than any other company – and that one third of its 738 signal boxes controlled junctions averaging one every . No two adjacent stations were more than apart and its 1,904 passenger services occupied 57 pages in &quot;Bradshaw&quot;, a number exceeded only by the Great Western Railway, the London and North Western Railway, and the Midland Railway. It was the first mainline railway to introduce electrification of some of its lines, and it also ran steamboat services across the Irish Sea and North Sea, being a bigger shipowner than any other British railway company.

It amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922. One year later, the merged company became the largest constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.

==History==

The L&amp;YR was incorporated in 1847 by the (10 &amp; 11 Vict. c. clxiii), being an amalgamation of several important lines, the chief of which was the Manchester and Leeds Railway (itself having been incorporated in 1836).

===Joint lines===
The L&amp;YR was a co-owner of several joint railways and joint stations. Besides those listed above, they included:
* Axholme Joint Railway (L&amp;YR, NER)
* Halifax and Ovenden Junction Railway (GNR, L&amp;YR)
* Halifax High Level Railway (GNR, L&amp;YR)
* Huddersfield railway station (LNWR, L&amp;YR)
* Knottingley railway station (GNR, L&amp;YR)
* Leeds Central railway station (GNR, LNWR, L&amp;YR, NER)
* Methley Joint Railway (GNR, L&amp;YR, NER)
* South Yorkshire Joint Railway (GCR, GNR, L&amp;YR, MR, NER)
* Wakefield Kirkgate railway station (GNR, L&amp;YR)
Unless otherwise stated, the owning railways had equal shares. In addition, the L&amp;YR had a one-third stake in the Dearne Valley Railway, the remaining two-thirds of which was owned by private shareholders.

===The system===
The system consisted of many branches and alternative routes, so that it is not easy to determine the location of its main line. For working purposes the railway was split into three divisions:
* &quot;Western Division&quot;:
** Manchester to Blackpool and Fleetwood;
** Manchester to Bolton, Wigan, Southport and Liverpool; and the direct line to Liverpool;
* &quot;East Lancashire&quot; or &quot;Central Division&quot;
** Manchester to Oldham, Bury, Rochdale, Todmorden, Accrington, Burnley and Colne. It also included the connection to the LNWR at Stockport for through traffic to London.
* &quot;Eastern Division&quot;:
** Todmorden to Halifax, Bradford, Leeds, Huddersfield, Wakefield, Normanton, Goole, and Doncaster.
Whereas there were various lines split between the Central and Western Divisions there was only one route connecting the Eastern and Central Divisions. This line cut through the Pennines between Lancashire and Yorkshire using a number of long tunnels, the longest of which was Summit Tunnel ( in length) near Rochdale. There were six other tunnels each more than long.

===Manchester Victoria railway station===
Manchester Victoria railway station was one of the largest railway stations in the country at the time. It occupied and had 17 platforms with a total length of . After the grouping, a structural change led platform 11 to run through and join with platform 3 in the LNWR&#x27;s adjacent Exchange station; at between ramps it became the longest railway platform in Britain. Lately the station capacity has been reduced to two platforms for Metrolink trams, two bay platforms, and four through platforms under Manchester Arena, which now replaces a significant area once occupied by the station. The main façade and station building of the original Hunts Bank station still exist and are kept in relatively good condition.

===Electrification===
The L&amp;YR was the first in the country to electrify a mainline route. In Liverpool, the fourth rail system pioneered by the tube railways in London was used at 600 V DC, although this was later converted to a third rail system. Suburban lines in the Liverpool area were electrified to reach a total of .
* Liverpool Exchange – and : 22 March 1904
* Liverpool – (two routes): July and December 1906
* Southport – : 1909
* Aintree – : 1913

In 1912 Dick, Kerr &amp; Co.&#x27;s Preston factory was considering tendering for a Brazilian contract, and approached the L&amp;YR to use the Bury to Holcombe Brook Line for test purposes at Dick, Kerr&#x27;s expense. The line from to was electrified with the overhead 3.5 kV DC system; rolling stock was also supplied at their cost. After prolonged trials the trains entered public use on 29 July 1913. The L&amp;YR purchased the equipment and stock on the successful completion of the trials in 1916.
In 1913 a decision was taken to electrify the Manchester to Bury route at 1.2 kV DC in an attempt to overcome competition from electric trams. Using the third rail system, trains powered by electric motor cars (or carriages) began running on 17 April 1916 but as Horwich was by then involved in war work, deliveries of the new electric stock were delayed and it was not until August 1916 that steam trains were withdrawn from the route. In 1920 the L&amp;YR also considered electrifying the Manchester–Oldham–Shaw and Royton lines, but no work was carried out. During 1917 work began to convert the Bury to Holcombe Brook line to a third rail system, matching the Manchester to Bury system. Third-rail trains started to run on 29 March 1918.

===Livery===

Locomotives of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway were originally painted dark green with ornate brasswork and copper-capped chimneys. Lining was black and white. In 1876 the dark green was changed to a light green and goods engines were painted plain black. 1878 saw the goods locomotives also appearing in light green. This livery was discontinued from 1883 when all locomotives were painted black. Lining was red and white for passenger locomotives and, if present, red only for goods locomotives.

Passenger coaching stock was originally painted teak, changing in 1875 to an overall light brown. In 1879 a decision was made to use &#x27;a little brighter shade&#x27;. Finally in June 1881 it was announced that the lower panels were to be painted &#x27;lake colour&#x27;. Between 1896 and 1914 the upper panels became buff with the lower in purple-brown, ends were dark brown. Roofs were normally dark grey but some did appear in red oxide.

Wagons were unpainted until 1902 except for the ironwork which was black. After 1902 it was painted dark grey. The graphical symbol of an inverted solid triangle within a circle was replaced in 1902–03 with the letters LY. Brake vans were black and special traffic wagons were painted in various colours, such as red for gunpowder, white for fish, and pale blue for butter.

The football team of the L&amp;YR Carriage and Wagon works at Newton Heath, Manchester, evolved into Manchester United F.C.

===Post-grouping history===
On 25 March 1921, the L&amp;YR and LNWR agreed terms under which the two railways would amalgamate. Before this could occur, the Railways Act 1921 became law on 19 August 1921, under which the L&amp;YR and LNWR would be forced to amalgamate on 1 January 1923 with each other and with other railways, such as the Midland Railway and the Caledonian Railway. The Act included provisions for two or more railways to amalgamate voluntarily before 1923; and the L&amp;YR and LNWR took the opportunity to implement their March 1921 agreement, and on 1 January 1922 both railways were dissolved and a new company was formed, which was also named the London and North Western Railway; its board of twenty directors included six from the former L&amp;YR. The 1923 Grouping duly occurred one years later, which involved the expanded LNWR forming part of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The general manager, secretary and chief mechanical engineer positions of the expanded company were taken by L&amp;YR employees. Ex-L&amp;YR lines formed the core of the LMS&#x27;s Central Division.

The LMS did little to develop the former L&amp;YR routes, which in many places ran parallel to ex-LNWR or ex-Midland routes now forming part of the same network. Nationalisation followed in 1948 followed by a period of rationalisation and modernisation. The L&amp;YR system has survived largely intact, although the following routes have been closed, many within the L&amp;YR&#x27;s old East Lancashire division:

*Bury to Manchester (converted to Manchester Metrolink operation in 1992)
*Bury to Clifton Junction, closed 1966
*Bury/Radcliffe to Bolton, closed 1970
*Bury to Rochdale, closed to regular passenger traffic 1970, but now partly preserved as the East Lancashire Railway heritage railway line
*Bury to Accrington/Bacup, closed to regular passenger traffic in 1966, but now partly preserved as the East Lancashire Railway heritage railway line
*Bury to Holcombe Brook, fully closed 1963
*Rochdale to Bacup, fully closed 1967
*Rochdale to Manchester via Oldham – &quot;The Oldham Loop&quot;, now converted to Manchester Metrolink operation
*Blackburn to Burnley via Padiham – &quot;The North Lancs or Great Harwood Loop&quot;, closed 1964
*Blackburn to Chorley, closed 1960
*Preston to Southport, closed 1964
*Preston to Longridge, closed 1930
*Southport to Altcar, closed 1952

===The routes today===
Most ex-L&amp;YR routes are now operated by Northern. Manchester Victoria station has been rebuilt in a more modest form and retains the former terminal building. The Caldervale Line, as named by West Yorkshire Metro, is also operated by Northern and uses a large part of the former L&amp;YR.

==Accidents and incidents==
* The Helmshore rail accident on 4 September 1860 saw 11 people killed and 77 injured when the rear portion of a Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway passenger excursion train became detached and ran back down the line where it collided with an oncoming passenger excursion train.
* The Burscough Junction crash occurred on 15 January 1880 at the station on the Liverpool to line, resulting in nine fatalities.
* A passenger train ran into a goods train near Mosesgate on 27 October 1880. Several passengers were injured and about a dozen carriages and a number of wagons were damaged.
* An excursion train was in collision with a West Lancashire Railway passenger train at , Lancashire on 3 August 1896 due to the driver of the excursion train misreading signals. One person was killed and seven were injured.
* A passenger train was derailed on 15 July 1903 at Waterloo station, then in Lancashire (now Merseyside) caused by a broken spring and spring bridle on the locomotive, while negotiating a curve at speed. Seven people were killed and 116 were injured.
* An express passenger train collided with a light engine at , Yorkshire on 22 October 1903 due to a signalman&#x27;s error. A third train collided with the wreckage at low speed. One person was killed.
* A collision between a London and North Western Railway (LNWR) empty stock train and a passenger train at , Yorkshire on 21 April 1905 killed two people. The driver of the LNWR train had overrun signals, but fatigue was a contributory factor.
* The Hall Road rail accident at Blundellsands in what is now Merseyside on 27 July 1905 saw 20 killed and 48 injured when two Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway electric passenger trains collided due to human error on the part of a signalman and a train driver.
* Two locomotives were shunted into a siding at Hindley &amp; Blackrod Junction, Lancashire on 22 January 1909, but one of them remained foul of the main line. A passenger train collided with it, killing one person and injuring 33.
* A passenger train was derailed on the Charlestown Curve when the track spread under it on 21 June 1912. Four people were killed and twelve were injured.
* A freight train became divided on 28 October 1913. The rear portion ran back and was derailed at , Yorkshire.
* On 18 March 1915, an express passenger train overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with an empty stock train at , Lancashire. Four people were killed and 33 were injured.
* A viaduct at Penistone, Yorkshire collapsed on 2 February 1916 due to subsidence. A locomotive was on the bridge at the time, but its crew had time to escape before it fell.
* A freight train became divided at Pendlebury, Lancashire. The rear portion was too heavy for the banking locomotive to hold, and it was pushed back downhill and derailed by catch points, as were the wagons.
* The Lostock Junction train collision near Bolton on 17 July 1920 saw four fatalities and 148 injured as the result of a near head-on collision between two Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway passenger trains due to a signal having been passed at danger

==Locomotives==

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway locomotive works were originally at Miles Platting, Manchester. From 1889 they were at Horwich.

During its existence the L&amp;YR stationed its locomotives at around sixty different depots, some of which belonged to another railway, or were shared. Not all were open at the same time: small depots were occasionally closed, with their duties being moved either to another existing depot, or to a new larger depot. By the early 20th century there were 32 depots, of which 27 were owned outright, three were jointly-owned with the LNWR, and two belonged to another railway. Each was given a code number:

# Newton Heath
# Low Moor
# Sowerby Bridge
# Leeds
# Mirfield
# Wakefield
# Normanton
# Barnsley
# Knottingley
# Goole
# Doncaster (Great Northern Railway)
# Hull (North Eastern Railway)
# Agecroft
# Bolton
# Horwich
# Wigan
# Southport
# Sandhills
# Aintree
# Bury
# Bacup
# Accrington
# Rose Grove
# Colne
# Lower Darwen
# Hellifield
# Lostock Hall
# Chorley
# Ormskirk
# Fleetwood (joint with LNWR)
# Blackpool Talbot Road (joint with LNWR)
# Blackpool Central (joint with LNWR)
==Surviving stock==

Surviving coaching stock of L&amp;YR origin go as far as 1878, with Directors Saloon No. 1 being privately preserved at the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway. Multiple coaches are preserved by Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Trust, at the Keighley &amp; Worth Valley Railway, 6-wheel 5-comp third No. 1507, Blackpool Club Car No. 47, 6-wheel 4-comp First No. 279 and Brake third No. 1474.

Many L&amp;YR carriages, that were sold to the Barry Railway Company also survive, one being a birdcage brake from 1882. 
A dynamometer car also survives at the Midland Rail Centre in Butterley.

Mostly covered goods vans survive in the form of L&amp;YR goods stock, some of these vans also passed into Cadbury ownership for use at Bournville. A brake van also survives at the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway and the body of a CCT van at the Cambrian Heritage Railways in Oswestry.

==Shipping==

The L&amp;YR had the largest ship fleet of all the pre-grouping railway companies. In 1902 the assets of the Drogheda Steam Packet Company were acquired for the sum of £80,000 (). In 1905 they took over the Goole Steam Shipping Company.

By 1913 they owned 26 vessels, with another two under construction, plus a further five under joint ownership with the London and North Western Railway. The L&amp;YR ran steamers between Liverpool and Drogheda, Hull and Zeebrugge, and between Goole and many continental ports including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Hamburg, and Rotterdam. The jointly-owned vessels provided services between Fleetwood, Belfast and Derry.

<text>Steve Lawrence (born Sidney Liebowitz; July 8, 1935 – March 7, 2024) was an American singer, comedian, and actor. He was best known as a member of the pop duo Steve and Eydie with his wife Eydie Gormé, and for his performance as Maury Sline, the manager and friend of the main characters in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; and its sequel. Steve and Eydie first appeared together as regulars on &quot;Tonight Starring Steve Allen&quot; in 1954 and continued performing as a duo until Gormé&#x27;s retirement in 2009.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born on July 8, 1935, as Sidney Liebowitz to Jewish parents in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. His father, Max, was a cantor at the Brooklyn synagogue Beth Sholom Tomchei Harav, and his mother, Helen, was a homemaker. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School. During high school, Lawrence skipped school to spend time at the Brill Building in the hopes of being employed as a singer.

==Career==
In 1952 at the age of 16, Lawrence signed a contract with King Records after winning a talent contest on Arthur Godfrey’s CBS TV show. The next year, talk show host Steve Allen hired Lawrence to be one of the singers on Allen&#x27;s local New York City late night show on WNBC-TV, with vocalists Eydie Gormé and Andy Williams. The show was chosen by NBC to be seen on the national network, becoming &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and Lawrence, Gormé, and Williams stayed until the program&#x27;s end in 1957. Lawrence credited the exposure and experience he gained on Allen&#x27;s show for launching his career “I think Steve Allen was the biggest thing that happened to me. Every night I was called upon to do something different. In its own way, it was better than vaudeville.”
In the late 1950s, Lawrence was drafted into the U.S. Army and served as the official vocal soloist with the United States Army Band &quot;Pershing&#x27;s Own&quot; in Washington, D.C.

Lawrence had success by means of the musical hit parades in the late 1950s and early 1960s with hits, including &quot;Party Doll&quot; (U.S. No. 5), &quot;Pretty Blue Eyes&quot; (U.S. No. 9), &quot;Footsteps&quot; (U.S. No. 7), &quot;Portrait of My Love&quot; (U.S. No. 9), and &quot;Go Away Little Girl&quot; (U.S. No. 1). &quot;Go Away Little Girl&quot; sold over 1 million copies and was awarded a Gold record. However, much of Lawrence&#x27;s musical career was centered on nightclubs and the musical stage.

He was also an actor, appearing in guest roles on television shows in every decade since the 1950s. After getting his start with Steve Allen&#x27;s late night show, he was seen on &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;; &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;; &quot;The Julie Andrews Hour&quot;; &quot;Night Gallery&quot;; &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;; &quot;Police Story&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;&quot;; and &quot;&quot;. Lawrence and Gormé starred in the 1958 summer replacement series &quot;The Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gormé Show.&quot; &quot;The Steve Lawrence Show&quot;, with supporting actor Charles Nelson Reilly, ran for 13 weeks in 1965. It was a variety show and one of the later television shows to air in black and white. Lawrence also served as a panelist on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; (1950–67). According to an interview from TCM, he made 29 appearances on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (1967–1978), with and without Eydie.

In 1964, Lawrence starred in the Broadway musical &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot;, which centered on an ambitious young man clawing his way to the top in Hollywood. It ran for 540 performances at the 54th Street Theater.

Lawrence and Gormé appeared together in the Broadway musical &quot;Golden Rainbow&quot;, which ran from February 1968 to January 1969. Although the show was not a huge success (a summary of this experience is chronicled in unflattering detail in William Goldman&#x27;s 1968 book &quot;The Season&quot;), the show contained the memorable song &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Be Me&quot;. This song originally was sung by Lawrence at the end of the first act of the musical. Sammy Davis Jr. later recorded a version of the song that hit number 11 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart in 1969.

Lawrence starred as Gary McBride in the 1972 film &quot;Stand Up and Be Counted&quot;. In 1980, he was introduced to a new generation of fans with his portrayal of Maury Sline in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, and reprised the role in the 1998 sequel &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;. Lawrence&#x27;s other films include &quot;The Lonely Guy&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Yards&quot; (2000). In 1984, Lawrence and comedian Don Rickles hosted ABC&#x27;s &quot;Foul-Ups, Bleeps &amp; Blunders&quot;. In 1985, Lawrence and Gormé played Tweedledee (Gormé) and Tweedledum (Lawrence) in Irwin Allen&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

Lawrence played Mark McCormick&#x27;s father, Sonny Daye, in two episodes of &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot;. He appeared on &quot;The Nanny&quot; several times — first as himself in season 2, episode 14, and then as the much-talked about, but never really seen, Morty Fine, father of Fran Fine in a few of the final episodes of the show. In 2011, he portrayed Jack, a wealthy love interest of Betty White&#x27;s character on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;. In 2014, he guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; on CBS and sang the theme song to the parody miniseries &quot;The Spoils of Babylon&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Lawrence and Gormé were married on December 29, 1957, at the El Rancho Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
They had two sons: David Nessim Lawrence (b. 1960) is an ASCAP Award-winning composer, who wrote the score for &quot;High School Musical&quot;, and Michael Robert Lawrence (1962–1986), who died suddenly from ventricular fibrillation resulting from an undiagnosed heart condition at the age of 23. Michael was an assistant editor for a television show at the time of his death and was apparently healthy despite a previous diagnosis of slight arrhythmia. Gormé and Lawrence were in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time of Michael&#x27;s death, having performed at the Fox Theater the night before. Upon learning of the death, family friend Frank Sinatra sent his private plane to fly the couple to New York to meet David, who was attending school at the time. Following their son&#x27;s death, Gormé and Lawrence took a year off before touring again.

Eydie Gormé died on August 10, 2013, at age 84, following an undisclosed illness.

Lawrence and his wife lived in Las Vegas and had a home in Los Angeles.

In June 2019, following public speculation about his health, Lawrence announced that he was in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and that treatment to slow its progression had so far been successful. Lawrence died from complications due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in Los Angeles, on March 7, 2024, at the age of 88.

David Lawrence tours with a tribute show to his parents entitled &quot;A Toast to Steve and Eydie&quot;.

==Awards==
Lawrence received nominations for a New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award and a Tony Award for his performance as Sammy Glick in &quot;What Makes Sammy Run?&quot; on Broadway (1964).

With Gormé, he was nominated for two Emmy Awards, one for &quot;Our Love Is Here to Stay&quot;, a tribute to George and Ira Gershwin. They won the 1979 Emmy for an Outstanding Comedy-Variety or Music Program for &quot;Steve &amp; Eydie Celebrate Irving Berlin&quot;. They also received a &quot;Best Performance By a Vocal Duo or Group&quot; Grammy Award for &quot;We Got Us&quot;; a Film Advisory Board&#x27;s Award of Excellence and a Television Critics Circle Award for &quot;From This Moment On&quot;, a tribute to Cole Porter.

The duo also won a Las Vegas Entertainment Award for Musical Variety Act of the Year four times, three of them consecutively. They were honored with a lifetime achievement award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 1995 were the recipients of an &quot;Ella Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; from the &quot;Society of Singers&quot;, a non-profit organization that helps professional singers with counseling and financial assistance.

==In popular culture==
Lawrence was portrayed by Mike Myers in the popular &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch &quot;The Sinatra Group&quot;, with Victoria Jackson portraying his wife Eydie Gormé.

<text>Sir William John Haley, KCMG (24 May 1901 – 6 September 1987) was a British newspaper editor and broadcasting administrator.

==Biography==
Haley grew up on the island of Jersey and attended Victoria College. In 1918 he began to study journalism, and in 1921 he secured his first newspaper employment at &quot;The Times&quot;, eventually being stationed in Brussels.

Early in his career on the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, Haley was found to be too shy to work as a reporter. He was then transferred to subediting. He rose through the ranks becoming director of Manchester Guardian and Evening News, Ltd after 8 years.

He served as Director-General of the BBC from 1944 to 1952 and from 1952 to 1966 he was editor of &quot;The Times&quot;. At &quot;The Times&quot; he wrote a series of light-hearted bookish articles under the pseudonym &#x27;Oliver Edwards&#x27;. These articles were published in 1957 by Heinemann as &#x27;Talking of Books&#x27;. While at the BBC he created the BBC Third Programme, which was replaced by BBC Radio 3 in 1967. He was made Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1946.

He was editor-in-chief of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; from January 1968 until resigning in April 1969 in an editorial dispute over how to adapt the work to new readers. It was reported that younger executives (including the company&#x27;s president, Charles E. Swanson) wanted to introduce livelier materials, while Haley favoured the traditional approach and an expansion in size.

Haley died in a nursing home in Jersey.

As a missile cruiser, she retained the #1 6-inch gun turret. The #2 turret was replaced with a dual 5&quot;/38 caliber mount; the aft armament was wholly replaced by missiles and the after side of the superstructure completely rebuilt.

===1960s===
Following shakedown out of Guantanamo Bay, &quot;Providence&quot; arrived at her new home port of Long Beach, California, 29 July 1960. After a six-month tour of duty with the 7th Fleet, she returned to Long Beach 31 March 1961.

Departing Yokosuka in July 1964, she returned to Long Beach in August. In October 1964 she began exercises in the Eastern Pacific. During January to June 1965, she received modern communications equipment. Spending the remainder of 1965 off the West Coast with the 1st Fleet, she participated in exercises and visited various West Coast ports.

===1970s===
&quot;Providence&quot; left San Diego to provide naval gunfire support off the coast of Vietnam from April to December 1972. For her service in Vietnam, she received her second Navy Unit Commendation in 1973:

&quot;The Secretary of the Navy takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Unit Commendation to USS &quot;Providence&quot; (CLG-6) for service as set forth in the following citation:&lt;br&gt;
For exceptionally meritorious service from 20 April 1972 to 1 December 1972 while participating in combat operations off the coast of North and South Vietnam. In her primary role of providing naval gunfire support to allied forces in Vietnam, USS &quot;Providence&quot; inflicted serious losses on the enemy. Her outstanding support of South Vietnamese forces played a significant role in containing the North Vietnamese invasion. During the South Vietnamese counteroffensive, &quot;Providence&quot; time and again provided the firepower when and where it was needed by the forces ashore. &quot;Providence&quot; was also called upon on numerous occasions to participate in operations to interdict the flow of supplies in North Vietnam. She accomplished this mission with daring and skill, often coming under intense hostile fire. &quot;Providence&quot; took part in the first multi-cruiser strike since World War II. This daring and successful raid on military targets in the Haiphong harbor area demonstrated superior teamwork and professionalism by the officers and men of USS &quot;Providence&quot;. Their sustained superior performance reflected great credit upon themselves, their ship, and the United States Naval Service.&lt;br&gt;
John W. Warner, Secretary of the Navy, 14 May 1973&quot;.

<doc id="564119" wikidata="Q3147283" url="?curid=564119" title="Ian Jacob">
<text>Lieutenant General Sir Edward Ian Claud Jacob (27 September 1899 – 24 April 1993), known as Ian Jacob, was a British Army officer, who served as the Military Assistant Secretary to Winston Churchill&#x27;s war cabinet and was later a distinguished broadcasting executive, serving as the Director-General of the BBC from 1952 to 1959.

==Early life==
Jacob was born in 1899 in Quetta, Pakistan (then a part of the British Empire). His father was Field Marshal Sir Claud Jacob, in whose footsteps Ian followed by becoming a professional soldier with the Royal Engineers in 1918, after being educated at both Wellington College, Berkshire and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, where he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers. He subsequently studied the mechanical sciences (engineering) tripos at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating with a second-class degree in 1925.

Jacob served as a commander of a company of Gentlemen Cadets at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich until January 1931 and later at the Staff College, Camberley from 1931 to 1932, (where he passed the entrance examination with record marks), his fellow students there including Brian Horrocks, Sidney Kirkman, Frank Simpson, Cameron Nicholson, Arthur Dowler, Nevil Brownjohn, and Thomas Rees. He also studied at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

In 1924, Jacob married Cecil Treherne, the daughter of another senior army officer, Surgeon Major-General Sir Francis Treherne. The couple had two sons, William and John.

==Wartime work==
Jacob served as the Military Assistant Secretary to the War Cabinet for the duration of the Second World War (he actually asked to be returned to his regiment in 1940, but was refused). He worked closely with Winston Churchill and implemented Churchill&#x27;s communications during his thirteen wartime journeys outside the United Kingdom. Churchill valued Jacob&#x27;s efforts enough to endorse his promotion from the rank of colonel to lieutenant general over the course of the war. As a brigadier (war-substantive lieutenant-colonel), Jacob was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel in the Regular Army on 30 June 1943. He was granted the acting rank of major-general on 8 September 1944 and advanced to temporary major-general on 8 September 1945. In the 1944 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion in the Military Division of the Order of the Bath (CB).

==Post-war==
As Jacob had never been in command of troops, he had few prospects for serious work in the forces after the war and sought to make use of his experience in communications. Indeed, he was one of a number of wartime information service staff who moved into broadcasting after 1945. Jacob retired from the Army on 1 July 1946 with the honorary rank of major-general.

By the end of the war, the BBC&#x27;s European Service (later the BBC World Service), based at Bush House, had become the world&#x27;s most respected and sophisticated foreign language broadcasting operation and had been admired for its contribution to the war effort. After the war, however, its significance was greatly reduced and its future in some doubt. The departing head of the service, Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick (who would become the Chairman of the Independent Television Authority a decade later), recommended Jacob as a potential successor. Sir William Haley, the BBC&#x27;s Director-General, had already met Jacob during preparations to report the news of the D-Day landings and was aware that his political contacts (Churchill in particular) could be valuable. He heeded Kirkpatrick&#x27;s recommendation, and Jacob was duly appointed Controller of the European Service following his retirement from the Army. Jacob accepted the post shortly after receiving a knighthood for his work with the war cabinet.

In 1947, Haley decided to rationalise the BBC&#x27;s overlapping European and Overseas services into a single operation. Jacob&#x27;s successful management of Bush House led to his being appointed Director of the reconstructed Overseas service in which post he continued until 1951. In February 1950, he helped to establish the European Broadcasting Union (responsible for the Eurovision Song Contest and similar events) and served as its first President until 1960.

==Back into government==
Churchill regained power in 1951, and in addition to being Prime Minister he took the office of Secretary of State for Defence. He immediately asked for William Haley to second Jacob from the BBC to reprise his advisory role, this time under the title of Chief Staff Officer. After a single visit to the United States of America and Canada, Churchill realised that the Defence portfolio was relatively dull during peacetime; he left the post and appointed Field Marshal the Earl Alexander as his replacement. Jacob was less comfortable working for Alexander than for Churchill, but a new opportunity arose for him in June 1952, when Haley announced he was to leave the BBC to become editor of &quot;The Times&quot;.

==Jacob as BBC Director-General==
As Haley departed, it was apparent that Jacob was likely to succeed him in the role of Director-General. Jacob was well respected by the senior staff of the BBC, much more so than the other candidate George Barnes, then the controller of BBC television. (Barnes had been appointed Controller of Television in 1950, despite having no enthusiasm for visual broadcasting, and was not popular within the BBC. Indeed, the BBC&#x27;s regional controllers informed the Chairman, Lord Simon of Wythenshawe, that they would resign simultaneously if Barnes was chosen over Jacob as Haley&#x27;s replacement). However, Jacob was still officially seconded to the Ministry of Defence, and so a member of the Board of Management, Sir Basil Nicholls, was made acting Director-General until Jacob could be released back to the BBC. Jacob eventually entered his new job on 1 December 1952.

Jacob&#x27;s tenure coincided with the rise of television, which was beginning to displace radio as the main broadcast medium (sales of Sound-and-Television licences overtook those of Sound-only licences in 1957). In contrast to Haley&#x27;s hard-bitten era, Jacob&#x27;s was a time of financial prosperity for the BBC. Indeed, he initially found it hard to persuade senior staff that money was available and that there was ample opportunity to spend it in developing television to the full.

Jacob was an enthusiast of news and current affairs programming, and was keen to continue the BBC&#x27;s tradition of accuracy and impartiality in its journalism. However, this goal led him to misinterpret the intentions of the controversial Editor of News, Tahu Hole, who was inclined to abuse the impartiality principle to avoid management responsibilities. In fact, it was only in 1958, by which time BBC News was being put to shame by its competitor Independent Television News, that Jacob finally noticed Hole&#x27;s shortcomings and moved him into an administrative post. Jacob did, however, campaign for the abolition of the restrictive Fourteen-Day Rule that prevented broadcast analysis of topics that were to be debated in parliament within the next fourteen days (the Rule was finally suspended in December 1956). Also during Jacob&#x27;s time as Director-General was the first showing of Panorama which is the world&#x27;s longest-running current affairs series as of 2017.

Jacob&#x27;s approach to news coverage was not always popular with the government. His former mentor Winston Churchill in particular had never liked the BBC&#x27;s journalistic impartiality, thinking that broadcast media should be a tool of government rather than a forum of political analysis and criticism. Churchill&#x27;s successor as Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, objected to the BBC&#x27;s reporting of the 1956 Suez Crisis. Eden insisted that unfavourable reports of the British bombardment of Egypt should not be broadcast to the world on the BBC&#x27;s Overseas Service, but Jacob refused to compromise:-

Eden responded by cutting the budget of the Overseas Service (which was, unlike today&#x27;s World Service, funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office rather than the Licence fee which funded the rest of the BBC). However, this punitive measure was lifted after Eden&#x27;s resignation in 1957 with no further restrictions on the BBC&#x27;s journalistic freedom.

Jacob was replaced as Director-General in 1960 by Hugh Carleton Greene. Though less radical (and certainly less well-known) than Greene, he saw the BBC successfully through many significant events in British broadcasting: the surge in television viewership (aided especially by the coverage of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953); the introduction of the competing ITV service in 1955; the gradual modernisation of some old eccentric practices (the aforementioned Fourteen-Day Rule and the &quot;Toddlers&#x27; Truce&quot; closedown period in the early evening). It was also mostly on the strength of Jacob&#x27;s work that the 1960 Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting recommended that the third television channel should be offered to the BBC, eventually materialising as BBC2 in 1964.

Jacob&#x27;s date of retirement was 31 December 1959. The following day, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year&#x27;s Honours.

==Later life==
Jacob was the co-author (along with Lord Ismay) of the 1963 &quot;Report on the Central Organisation of Defence&quot;, a work he later came to regard as his most important ever. He was also a trustee of the Imperial War Museum between 1966 and 1973 and was a County Councillor in Suffolk for two separate periods (1960–1970 and 1974–1977). He was a Deputy lieutenant for the county from 1964 to 1968.

<doc id="564120" wikidata="Q7056819" url="?curid=564120" title="North Staffordshire Railway">
<text>The North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) was a British railway company formed in 1845 to promote a number of lines in the Staffordshire Potteries and surrounding areas in Staffordshire, Cheshire, Derbyshire and Shropshire.

The company was based in Stoke-on-Trent and was nicknamed The Knotty; its lines were built to the standard gauge of . The main routes were constructed between 1846 and 1852 and ran from Macclesfield via Stoke to Colwich Junction joining the Trent Valley Railway, with another branch to Norton Bridge, just north of Stafford, and from Crewe to Egginton Junction, west of Derby. Within these main connections with other railway companies, most notably the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), the company operated a network of smaller lines although the total route mileage of the company never exceeded . The majority of the passenger traffic was local although a number of LNWR services from Manchester to London were operated via Stoke. Freight traffic was mostly coal and other minerals but the line also carried the vast majority of china and other pottery goods manufactured in England.

As the NSR was surrounded by other larger railway companies, there were in the 19th century several attempts emanating from other companies or proposals from NSR shareholders to amalgamate with one or more of the other companies that adjoined it. None of these came to fruition and the NSR remained an independent company up to 1923 when it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company.

The main routes of the NSR are still in use today; the routes connecting Stoke-on-Trent with Macclesfield, Crewe, Stafford and Colwich Junction remain in use as important parts of the West Coast Main Line, whilst the Stoke to Derby route also remains in use, however most of the less important lines built by the company have since been closed.

==Before the railway==
The area of north Staffordshire known today as the City of Stoke-on-Trent was already a thriving industrial area before the arrival of the railways. The establishment of the pottery industry and the development of coal and ironstone mines in the 18th century had provided a need for materials, most noticeably clay, to be brought into the area. A corresponding need also arose for the resulting fragile pottery goods to be taken away from the area. This need had given rise in the mid to late 18th century of the construction of the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal (T&amp;M) and its various branches. Opened in 1777 it was a spectacular success and paid dividends reaching 75% in 1822. By 1845 this had fallen to a still impressive 30% despite the onset of railway development in the northwest England. In 1836 the canal carried of goods away and brought in .

It was the Trent and Mersey Canal Company that built the first railway in north Staffordshire when in 1776 it was granted powers in the Trent and Mersey Canal Act 1776 (16 Geo. 3. c. 32) to build a railway, or plateway, from Caldon Low limestone quarries to the canal basin at Froghall in the Churnet Valley.

==Formation of the company==
The Railway Mania of 1845 found the Potteries still without a railway, although the surrounding towns of Stafford, Crewe, Derby and Macclesfield were all connected to the fledgling railway system. The &quot;Staffordshire Potteries Railway&quot; promoted a route from Macclesfield to the Grand Junction Railway mainline at Norton Bridge plus a spur to Crewe. At the same time the &quot;Churnet Valley Railway&quot; promoted a line from Macclesfield to Derby with a branch to Stoke. After these two companies applied for the necessary powers to build the lines, Parliament suggested a pause of a year &quot;to afford time for consideration and for maturing some more complete scheme for the accommodation of that important district&quot;.

The two companies decided to join forces to make a new approach to Parliament. They also incorporated in the scheme a proposal to join the Trent Valley Railway into the Potteries. To do this they promoted the &quot;North Staffordshire or Churnet Valley and Trent Junction Railway&quot;. This prospective company issued its prospectus on 30 April 1845 from offices at 1 Old Palace Yard, Westminster, London. There was to be a share capital of £2,350,000 (£ in ). in £20 shares (117,500 shares).

The prospectus outlined the NSR&#x27;s plans for two main lines. The &quot;Pottery Line&quot; running from a junction with the Manchester &amp; Birmingham railway at Congleton to the Grand Junction Railway at Colwich was promoted, as &quot;giving the most ample accommodation to the towns of Tunstall, Burslem, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton, Longton and Stone&quot;. The &quot;Churnet Line&quot; was to run from Macclesfield though Leek, Cheadle and Uttoxeter to join the Midland Railway line between Burton-upon-Trent and Derby forming a direct link between Manchester and Derby.

The company was formally incorporated in April 1845 under the shorter name of the North Staffordshire Railway. As a way of eliminating opposition to the company&#x27;s bills in Parliament, and to allow it to promote a line to Liverpool, the company made an agreement to take over the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal Company. This was achieved by T&amp;M shares being swapped for preference shares in the NSR. These preference shares paid a guaranteed annual dividend of 5% once the entire railway was open. The total purchase cost of the T&amp;M to the NSR £1,170,000.

On 25 November 1845 the &quot;Derby and Crewe Railway&quot; was absorbed into the NSR scheme. This was a line that was being supported by the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) running between Derby and Crewe via Uttoxeter and Stoke. It was to eliminate the opposition of the Grand Junction company to the other NSR proposals that the NSR agreed to absorb the &quot;Derby and Crewe&quot;. However part of the deal was that the proposed line from Harecastle to Liverpool was abandoned. Despite having arranged to purchase the T&amp;M canal for a considerable sum, to obtain support for the Liverpool extension the NSR agreed to the GJR demand. All that survived of the NSR Liverpool plan was the short branch to Sandbach from Harecastle.

==Parliamentary approval and construction==
On 26 June 1846, the three NSR acts were passed with the total of £2,900,000 in share capital being shared amongst the three lines, with seven years allowed for the completion of each line. The North Staffordshire Railway (Pottery Line) Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. lxxxv) provided for the construction of the line from Macclesfield to Colwich with branches to Norton Bridge, Newcastle, Silverdale and Crewe. Parliamentary approval for building railways was needed to allow for compulsory purchase of the land needed for construction. This act also vested the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal in the NSR. Allocated capital for this work was £1,500,000. The second act, the North Staffordshire Railway (Harecastle and Sandbach) Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. lxxxiv) provided for the construction of the line from Harecastle to Sandbach, allocated capital for these works was £200,000. Finally the North Staffordshire Railway (Churnet Valley) Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. lxxxvi) authorised the construction of the line from North Rode to Burton, a branch from Tutbury to Willington Junction near Derby, and the line between Uttoxeter and Stoke; £1,200,000 of capital was allocated to this.

To start the construction work, there was an official sod-cutting ceremony. This took place in September 1846 The site chosen for the ceremony was a field in Etruria. A roped off enclosure for directors was created and the remainder of the field was reserved for invited guests. A mile-long procession headed by John Lewis Ricardo, Member of Parliament for Stoke-on-Trent and chairman of the NSR Company, formed. On Ricardo&#x27;s arrival, the crowds broke through the roped off area and Ricardo was pushed and shoved. During the actual cutting he buckled the silver spade and had difficulty removing the sod. Finally, his hat blew away.

Construction work went ahead under the supervision of the consulting engineer, George Parker Bidder. By February 1847 there were 1,318 men and 60 horses working between Macclesfield and Colwich and they had removed of earth, driven of tunnel heading and erected yards of fencing.

On 2 July 1847 the North Staffordshire Railway Act 1847 (10 &amp; 11 Vict. c. cviii) was passed. This act was necessary was because of problems encountered with the construction of the Crewe branch. The opportunity was taken to authorise several other deviations and small branches. It also consolidated the previous acts and importantly, forced the NSR to ensure that all lines were completed by specifying that ordinary dividends were not to exceed 5% until the Churnet Valley and Willington lines had been opened.

Work continued apace and by 3 April 1848 the first freight trains were run. Passenger services started on 17 April 1848 and the first passenger train left the temporary station at Wheildon Road, Stoke, hauled by locomotive No. 1 &quot;Dragon&quot;, heading for a temporary station at Norton Bridge on the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The opening of the line gave the Potteries a railway link with Birmingham and London which made it an instant success with the public. Profits for the first two months were £1,668, &quot;exceeding expectations&quot;.

The remaining lines under the original acts were opened in stages but all were completed and open by the end of 1852 when the Stoke to Newcastle and Newcastle to Knutton sections opened. A few months after the opening of the first line, the imposing permanent station in Winton Square, Stoke was opened on 9 October 1848. Stoke station then became the headquarters of the NSR.

==Later lines==

Later branches constructed in the nineteenth century included lines from Stoke-on-Trent to Congleton via Smallthorne and Biddulph; Stoke-on-Trent to Leek; Newcastle to Silverdale, Keele and Market Drayton (junction with the Great Western Railway); Alsager to Audley, Leycett and Keele, and Rocester to Ashbourne.

Also opened in the 19th century was the only NSR line to achieve any degree of fame, the Potteries Loop Line from Etruria via Hanley, Cobridge, Burslem, Tunstall, Pitts Hill, Newchapel and Goldenhill to Kidsgrove Liverpool Road. Authorised in stages in 1864–65, it opened to traffic in 1873. Its fame came from several mentions and a description of a journey on a Burslem to Hanley train in Arnold Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot;.

Twentieth century construction included the Waterhouses branch line from Leekbrook Junction to Caldon Low quarries and Waterhouses from where the narrow gauge Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway (L&amp;MV) was constructed through the Hamps and Manifold river valleys to Hulme End near Hartington. Although the L&amp;MV was nominally independent the NSR both worked and operated the line.

Finally in 1910, the short Trentham Park branch line was built from Stoke-on-Trent to Trentham Park. It was authorised as part of an alternative line to Newcastle-under-Lyme but construction work beyond Trentham was quickly abandoned owing to rising costs. The same act of Parliament also transferred the Cheadle Railway to the NSR. The Cheadle Railway was a small local company constructed with NSR&#x27;s backing, built at great cost over a period of twelve years. It was a short line from Cresswell to Cheadle, this line, only long, included a very difficult tunnel. The line was opened from Cresswell to Totmonslow on 7 November 1892 and to Cheadle on 1 January 1901.

A full list of authorisation and opening dates for sections of the NSR is given below.

==Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway==
The Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway (MB&amp;M) was a joint line which the NSR participated in. A short line of just under it was opened with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;L) in 1869 to give the NSR access to Manchester independently of the LNWR. As relationships between the NSR and the LNWR grew better the reason for the line lessened as the MB&amp;M route to Manchester was longer than the LNWR route. Both passenger and freight traffic was handled by the MS&amp;L (or, as it later became, the Great Central Railway) with the buildings maintained by the NSR.

==Running powers with other companies==
As a company with only a small route mileage the NSR made extensive use of running powers and in exchange granted running powers to other companies.

The earliest agreements were reached with the LNWR. In 1849 an agreement was reached where LNWR traffic could work over the NSR system but in exchange a certain amount of the LNWR London trains had to be routed via Stoke. These Manchester to London Euston restaurant car expresses were unique in often being hauled by NSR tank engines from Manchester to Stoke-on-Trent where the LNWR express engines took over for the run via Stone, Sandon, Colwich, and the main line to London Euston. The NSR received a payment for every through passenger on these trains and employed a small army of ticket inspectors to examine and clip (with its distinctive &#x27;P&#x27; clip) every ticket during the Stoke-on-Trent station stop. The agreement did give the NSR access to destinations such as Llandudno, Manchester, Stafford, Wolverhampton and Buxton. NSR goods trains were able to run to places such as Liverpool and Rugby. The LNWR also used running rights over the Uttoxeter–Ashbourne line to run through coaches from Buxton to London via Nuneaton. As well as the running power agreements with the LNWR there was a very short joint line of at Middlewood and three jointly owned stations; Ashbourne, Colwich and Macclesfield Goods.

Equally important in terms of traffic but not as extensive in terms of route were the running power agreements with the Midland Railway (MR). For the NSR passenger traffic into Derby and Burton was authorised and good traffic as far afield as Wellingborough. The arrangements with these two companies allowed the NSR to run its longest passenger service, between Derby and Llandudno. These trains only ran on NSR rails, with over MR but with the majority, over the LNWR.

In 1867, an independent local company built the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway, later incorporated into the Great Northern Railway (GNR). The GNR built its GNR Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension from Nottingham and Derby Friargate via Mickleover to Egginton Junction with running powers over the NSR from Etwall, through Uttoxeter, to Bromshall Junction. The GNR granted the NSR running rights to Nottingham, Colwick, Leicester and Peterborough. Apart from excursion trains to Nottingham and goods trains to Colwick, the NSR did not take advantage of these powers.

Although the NSR had joint ownership of the MB&amp;M with the MS&amp;L the NSR did not have running powers over the rest of the MS&amp;L and was content to let the MS&amp;L handle all traffic north of Middlewood. Finally with both the NSR and the Great Western Railway (GWR) expanding into Shropshire running rights were agreed for NSR trains to run to Hodnet and Wellington and in return GWR goods trains could run to Stoke.

==Amalgamation proposals and financial strength==
There were several proposals made either to the NSR or by it, to merge or lease or sell the company to other railway companies. The first was in 1849 when the LNWR, using its financial strength, made suggestions about a merger. To avoid this the NSR had to agree to the running powers outlined above. A further attempt in 1851 got as far as a parliamentary bill being submitted for amalgamation until the select committee appointed to look at the bill reported against the idea. The LNWR made a further attempt in 1855 which failed because of concerted opposition by the MR, MS&amp;L and GWR. Less than twenty years later, in 1870, these four companies all combined to look at taking over the NSR following a decision by the NSR board to sell or lease the company. The four rival companies were unable to agree on who would take what share of the NSR and the proposal floundered.

In 1875, the MS&amp;L proposed an amalgamation which initially found favour with the NSR board and shareholders but eventually fell through when the MS&amp;L finances were investigated and it was found that the MS&amp;L was no stronger financially than the NSR. Only two years later some NSR shareholders proposed a merger with the MR, the board dismissed the proposal with the chairman reminding shareholders that

The NSR had a small mileage and had to collect traffic for the large companies which surrounded it. They made profits from good mileages while the NSR had to do a great deal for comparatively little return.

The quote about little return was accurate. In 1877 the NSR dividend was only 2% compared with the dividend of 6% paid by the LNWR to its shareholders. A year later the dividend fell to its lowest ever point of only 1.625%. However it recovered and after 1881 never fell below 3%. In 1891 the NSR paid a 5% dividend for the first time, a level not to be reached again until 1913.

In 1913 the NSR ranked as the eighteenth largest company by route mileage with . Passenger numbers stood at 7,200,000 and goods traffic handled by the NSR consisted of of goods, nearly of coal and coke and over of other minerals. Among the of goods was of pottery, over five-sixths of the entire production in Britain.

==Grouping==

Under the Railways Act 1921, the NSR was one of the eight major companies designated to form the North Western, Midland and West Scottish Group. This group became the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The act came into force on 1 January 1923 but along with the Caledonian Railway, the NSR amalgamation into the LMS was delayed until 1 July 1923 due to certain legal requirements not being completed by the due date.

==Accidents and incidents==
*In January 1885, a London and North Western Railway express passenger train collided with a freight train near Stoke-on-Trent. One person was killed.
*On 27 December 1864 there was a collision between a London and North Western Railway goods engine and van and a North Staffordshire Railway passenger train at Congleton junction where the Biddulph Valley line joined the Stafford-Manchester line.
*On 17 February 1899 there was a collision at Congleton railway station.

==Other interests==
In common with most other British railway companies, the NSR decided early on that it was advantageous to carry out its own maintenance work in all departments and also to undertake much of its own new construction work. Stoke railway works were opened in 1849, capable of producing carriages, wagons and other equipment. Construction of locomotives followed later, commencing in 1864.

Ownership of the Trent &amp; Mersey canal made the NSR the biggest canal owning railway with of waterways owned. The T&amp;M owned Rudyard Lake which the NSR made use of as a leisure complex, building a golf course, in 1905, on land adjoining the lake. A further area of interest, again via ownership of the T&amp;M, was the lease on Caldon Low quarries. Associated with the quarry was the tramway that ran from the quarries to Froghall making the NSR the operator of lines of three different gauges.
Although the NSR principally served the urban areas of the Potteries, it did promote the area for tourism, especially the Churnet Valley which local hoteliers had labelled as &quot;Staffordshire&#x27;s little Switzerland&quot;. The company issued a 150-page guide called &quot;Picturesque Staffordshire&quot; to support this promotion and dispel the widespread held idea that the county was dull and bleak In addition to the tourist traffic generated the NSR owned three hotels; the &quot;North Stafford&quot; in Stoke (opposite Stoke station), the &quot;Churnet Valley&quot; in Leek and the &quot;Hotel Rudyard&quot; at Rudyard.

==Motive power and rolling stock==

===Locomotives===

NSR motive power came from a mixture of sources. Before the establishment of Stoke works there was a complete reliance on outside contractors. The first locomotives were either purchased from contractors building the line or firms such as Sharp Brothers and Company, B. Hick and Son, Kitson, Thompson and Hewitson, the Vulcan Foundry or Jones and Potts.

Originally the resident engineers were responsible for the locomotive stock and the first four holders of this post were all primarily civil engineers. In 1863 the new general manager, Morris, commissioned an outside report on the NSR locomotive fleet which recommended the rebuilding of 50 engines. By the time this report was produced a new engineer, Johnson, had been appointed. He undertook the improvements but the results were unsatisfactory and Johnson left in 1870 after only five years in post. The only significant event of Johnson&#x27;s tenure was the building of the first engines at Stoke works when three 0-6-0T engines were built in 1868. Johnson&#x27;s successor, Dodds, fared no better as his patented wedge motion, a type of valve gear, was unsuccessful. Dodds was dismissed in 1875 and a new post of locomotive superintendent created with a locomotive engineer, Angus, in charge. Although only in post for two years Angus replaced all the wedge motions with Stephenson valve gear.

There followed a long period of locomotive construction internally with all locomotives between 1875 and 1900 coming from the company works. The vast majority of these being tank engines although a small number of tender engines were constructed. Most engines, whether tank or tender locomotives were built with either 2-4-0 or 0-6-0 wheel arrangements. An urgent need for heavier goods engines prompted the company to go to contractors and a small number of 0-6-0 designs were purchased from Nasmyth, Wilson and Company. In 1903 five 0-6-2T engines were purchased from Vulcan Foundry and with the exception of two locomotives for shunting purchased from Kerr Stuart in 1919 these were the last engines not to be built by the company at Stoke.

Apart from engine No 1 of 1848 being named &quot;Dragon&quot; only two other NSR engines were ever named, in 1882 Class C 2-4-0 No. 55 was named &quot;Colin Minton Campbell&quot; and Class C No. 54 &quot;John Bramley Moore&quot; after the chairman and deputy chairman of the company, respectively.

The NSR also used a small number of railmotors with three being purchased in 1905 from Beyer, Peacock and Company. They were used on routes such as the Stoke–Newcastle service but were not a success. The vehicles did survive until grouping but had been taken out of service for some time some years earlier. In addition to the NSR locomotives were the two engines of the Leek &amp; Manifold and the three engines that worked the Caldon Low quarries. The former were purchased from Kitson and Company and the latter from Henry Hughes and W. G. Bagnall.
At grouping 196 steam locomotives including the L&amp;MV and Caldon Low engines were absorbed into the LMS along with the three railmotors and one battery electric locomotive. This last engine was built at Stoke in 1917 for shunting the copper works at Oakamoor. Four engines under construction at Stoke in 1923 were completed and also added to the LMS stock. Although many of the locomotives were not old, due to the LMS policy of standardisation all NSR engines had been withdrawn from service by 1939. The one exception was the battery electric shunting locomotive which remained in service until 1963.

Two NSR locomotives are preserved. NSR No. 2, an 0-6-2T New L class (one of the four constructed in 1923) and the battery electric locomotive. Both formed part of the national collection at the National Railway Museum but in 2016 ownership of the New L class locomotive was transferred to the Foxfield Railway where the locomotive is now on display.

====Locomotive depots====
The largest locomotive depot was at Stoke, with 125 engines at grouping. The next largest was Alsager with an allocation of 15 engines. Other NSR depots existed at Macclesfield, Derby, Uttoxeter, Burton and Crewe. Stoke also had sub-sheds at Market Drayton, Leekbrook and Ashbourne. NSR engines were also sub-shedded at other companies depots, with arrangements existing at the LNWR sheds at Stafford, Liverpool Edge Hill and Manchester Longsight and the GNR shed at Nottingham Colwick.

====Locomotive liveries====
Up to 1882 locomotives were a bright green with black and white lining with a Staffordshire knot emblem on the tank or tender sides. Longbottom introduced a new livery of a red brown with black, yellow and vermilion lining. Longbottom was succeeded by Adams who changed the livery once more to a crimson shade called Madder Lakewith yellow and vermilion lining. The knot emblem was replaced by the company coat of arms and the words &quot;North Stafford&quot;.

===Coaching stock===
The NSR coaching stock was, even until grouping, predominantly four and six wheeled vehicles. Four-wheeled carriages were the norm from the start and the last were constructed in the 1880s, although by then they had progressed from the unbraked coaches of the 1840s with the introduction of the communication cord in 1869 and the simple vacuum brake in 1883. The first bogie coaches were introduced in 1906 for use on the Derby–Llandudno service and these were followed by further examples until 1923. By 1919 all carriages, except 13 four-wheelers used on miners&#x27; trains, had been fitted with steam heating and a number of vehicles had been fitted with through pipes to allow use in trains equipped with Westinghouse brakes. Most carriages were constructed at Stoke but some were purchased from companies such as the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company.

One area where the NSR was a pioneer was in the use of electrical lighting being the largest of only three British railway companies to switch from oil to electric lighting and not use any form of gas lighting. The first coach was fitted in 1897 and new stock constructed from 1899 had electric lighting as standard. Conversion of the remaining stock was slow and in 1910 there were still some oil-lit carriages in service.

====Coaching liveries====
Coaching stock was originally claret but in 1875 was changed to Victoria Brown and white (except for branch line trains which carried an all over Victoria Brown livery) with gold and blue lining. Victoria Brown was the same red brown colour as Longbottom had introduced for NSR locomotives. In 1882 waist panels were additionally painted white. This colour scheme lasted until 1896 when it was changed to an overall Victoria Lake (brown) colour with gold and blue lining. Adams changed the livery to Madder Lake in 1903 to match the locomotives, the lining became yellow and red. A final minor change was to paint the waist panels of first class compartments cream to distinguish them. A constant presence was the company coat of arms being displayed on the coach sides.

===Goods stock===
Over its life the NSR built or bought many thousands of goods wagons. Early wagons had dumb buffers with spring buffers being introduced from 1870. Early wagons were not of high capacity, for example typical open wagons were only of capacity. but capacities grew to on average by 1923.

The NSR handed over to the LMS 6,612 goods wagons of which over 5,000 were open wagons for the transport of coal and other minerals. This number was dwarfed by the number of wagons owned by the pits, ironworks, other industrial operations and traders in the Stoke area. An unusual set of wagons to be seen were the bright yellow with red lettering vans owned by the Barnum and Bailey circus who had their main English depot in Stoke.

====Goods liveries====
Goods vehicles were painted red oxide with white lettering and a white Staffordshire knot. The letters &quot;N.S.R&quot; with only two full stops were carried in small letters. From 1912 the letters were increased in size but changed to just &quot;N S&quot; with a central knot and no full stops.

==&quot;The Knotty&quot;==

The NSR is one of the few railways to become the subject of a play. In 1966, Peter Cheeseman, artistic director of The Victoria Theatre, Stoke wrote a musical documentary about the NSR called &quot;The Knotty&quot;. Featured in the play were the voices of several NSR staff who had been interviewed especially for the play. The script with introductory notes by Cheeseman was published in 1970. Sound recordings of the production, &quot;The Knotty – a musical documentary&quot;, was released on LP by Argo Transacord in 1970 and as a digital version in 2014.

==NSR main lines and branch lines—opening dates==
John Lewis Ricardo, chairman of the North Staffordshire Railway, described the network as being like &quot;a small octopus&quot;; but not one NSR station was more than from Stoke-on-Trent. Dates of authorisation and opening are given in the following table.

<text>The Furness Railway (Furness) was a railway company operating in the Furness area of Lancashire in North West England.

==History==

===Formation===
In the early 1840s, the owners of iron ore mines in the Furness district of Lancashire became interested in a waggonway from their mines to Barrow; the project was adopted and expanded by the Duke of Buccleuch and the Earl of Burlington. Advertisements in 1843 announced a scheme, supported by their Lordships, for a Furness Railway to link Ulverston &#x27;the capital of the district&#x27;, iron ore mines (at Dalton-in-Furness) and slate mines (at Kirkby-in-Furness) with the coast at Barrow harbour and at Piel pier. Traffic on the line would be horse-drawn, but the line was to be laid out to allow easy conversion to the use of steam power. 
A survey had already been carried out by James Walker. &quot;The primary object of this undertaking&quot; explained a subsequent advertisement &quot;is to improve the present very dilatory provision for the transport of the valuable Mineral products of Furness and adjoining Districts to the Coast&quot; but it was noted from the start that much of the line would form part of any coastal route north from Lancaster.

The subscription to the company was largely taken up by the duke and the earl, and their associates; although there were some local subscribers – Henry Schneider was on the company&#x27;s provisional committee – failure to attract local capital meant that the original intention to serve Ulverston was dropped. The company&#x27;s bill was not opposed in Parliament and the act was given royal assent on 23 May 1844 as the Furness Railway Act 1844 (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. xxii). A further act in 1846 authorised extensions from Kirkby to Broughton-in-Furness, and from Dalton to Ulverston. Goods traffic began running between Dalton and Barrow in June 1846, operated by a single locomotive. The line was passed for passenger use early in August 1846; by the end of the month, passenger trains were running from Dalton to Piel pier, connecting with a steamer to Fleetwood.

At a celebratory excursion and dinner for the directors and friends held at the end of October 1846, it was remarked that the mineral traffic was limited by a shortage of wagons (which prevented the Dalton branch handling more than 2,000 tons of iron ore a day) and of locomotives (which meant that the Kirkby branch was not yet being worked), and that 10,000 of the 12,000 passengers carried so far were excursionists from Fleetwood or Blackpool. Passenger services ceased after about two months, and the line between Dalton and Rampside Junction was doubled to remove the difficulties experienced in working both mineral and passenger traffic on a single track line. In 1847, differences between the railway company and the owner of Piel pier saw the Fleetwood steamer running to Barrow; it returned to Piel pier in 1848; subsequently, steamers also ran between Piel pier and Poulton-le-Sands, connecting with the &quot;Little&quot; North Western Railway. Periodic disagreements and reconciliations saw the steamer service terminal switch between Piel and Barrow on a number of occasions until (1853) the Furness Railway bought the pier.

===Extensions===
The Kirkby branch was extended to Broughton, passing inspection for passenger traffic at the end of February 1848; when a Broughton to Barrow train was derailed by mis-set points in July 1849, it was noted that &quot;nearly all the gates and points on the Furness line are attended by women&quot; and that a woman had the management of the points which had been mis-set. The Dalton branch was extended to Lindal (goods traffic running from mines there from early May 1851) and then on to Ulverston, eight waggons of coal being delivered there from Whitehaven in April 1854, even before the station was complete. Passenger services on that section began in June 1854. In 1854, 330,000 tons of iron ore travelled over the railway (as against 225,000 tons the previous year), other goods traffic was up from 22,000 tons in 1853 to 40,000 tons, and there were 145,000 passenger movements (95,000 in 1853); the company declared a dividend at a rate of 6% a year.

Copper mining interests at Coniston promoted the Coniston Railway, running from the Furness Railway at Broughton to Coniston and on to the copper mines. The line was nominally independent of the FR, but the Duke of Devonshire (as the Earl of Burlington had become in 1858) was its chairman; the FR took shares in it, and worked it. It opened for passenger traffic 19 July 1859, although its opening for goods and mineral traffic was deferred for some months as the provision was still incomplete. The Furness Railway obtained powers to amalgamate the Coniston Railway with it in 1862.

A branch was built from (just west of) the Leven viaduct to Greenodd (allowing suppression of a swing bridge in the viaduct) then through Newby Bridge to a terminus beside Windermere at Finsthwaite; the locality had been known as The Landing, but the station was named Lake-side. The line opened June 1869; a company part-owned (after 1873 fully owned) by the FR ran Windermere steamer services in conjunction with the trains; a Bowness resident promptly writing to the &quot;Times&quot; to query the absence of lifeboats on the steamers.

===Connections and acquisitions===

====Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway====
The Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway was completed in November 1851, connecting the Furness Railway to Whitehaven and (on completion of the Bransty tunnel at Whitehaven in 1852) to the West Coast Main Line at Carlisle. In 1865, the W&amp;FJR was leased by the Furness Railway, with a full amalgamation taking effect on 1 July 1866, being authorised by an act of Parliament of 1866. The secretary-manager of the W&amp;FJR became secretary of the Furness Railway, whose general manager was promoted to the board of the company, retaining his salary but now being styled &#x27;resident director&#x27;. The Furness Railway now extended to Whitehaven, with running powers to Workington, and to the iron works on the North side of the Derwent there. The FR also inherited the W&amp;FJR&#x27;s involvement in the Cleator and Furness Railway, a joint line with the Whitehaven Cleator and Egremont Railway linking the WC&amp;ER at Egremont with the W&amp;FJR at Sellafield to simplify the movement of ore southwards; this line opened on 1 August 1869.

In 1865, before the lease and amalgamation, the W&amp;FJR and the FR had put forward rival Bills for crossing the Duddon estuary much lower down it than the existing crossing at Foxfield, thus usefully shortening the rail distance between Whitehaven (and points north) and Barrow (and Carnforth). The parliamentary committee had decided in favour of the W&amp;FJR, and the scheme was inherited by the FR. However, in 1868 the FR decided to abandon the project: there was a trade recession (the FR&#x27;s dividend being consequently reduced to 8% from its accustomed 10%) and the FR had recently made major capital outlays on the Furness and Midland line (£100,000) and the construction of wet docks at Barrow (£200,000): an Act sanctioning the abandonment was obtained in 1869, but the FR had henceforth to charge on the basis of the mileages if the crossing had been built. After the discovery of a large hematite deposit in the Holborn Hill area, the line between Millom and Barrow was doubled throughout; the line between Seascale and Bootle was also doubled.

====Ulverstone and Lancaster Railway====
The Ulverstone and Lancaster Railway was built by a separate company to link Ulverston with , on the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway thus giving a rail link southwards from Furness and West Cumbria to the West Coast Main Line so that – as the Earl of Burlington noted at a celebratory banquet marking the opening of the line on 26 August 1857 – they &quot;were now joined in the great network of the rest of England&quot;, allowing a lucrative goods traffic: &quot; A few days ago some 67 tons of pig iron, the produce of the new blast furnace at Harrington passed over the Whitehaven Junction and Whitehaven and Furness Railways &quot;en route&quot; direct to South Staffordshire by the newly-opened railway across the Ulverston Sands&quot;. In 1858, after completion of the U&amp;LR, modifications were made to the junctions at Foxfield (with the W&amp;FJR) and at Millwood (where the Broughton and Ulverston branches met) to allow through running of Whitehaven-Carnforth traffic without reversing.

From its opening, the U&amp;LR was worked by the Furness Railway, which purchased it (with effect from July 1861) in 1862, taking over the Ulverston Canal Company in the same year. The line from Barrow to Ulverston was already double-track, and the line between Ulverston and Carnforth was doubled in 1863.

====Furness and Midland Joint Railway====
In 1863, in conjunction with the Midland Railway, the FR promoted a bill for the Furness and Midland Joint Railway between Wennington and Carnforth; the intention was said to be to give a more direct connection between the iron ore of Furness and Yorkshire ironworks and coal-mines. The London and North Western Railway cast doubt on this, pointing out that Furness got its metallurgical coke from South Durham over the Stainmore line and exported most of its ore to districts better served by the LNWR, but withdrew its objection on being offered the same powers as the Midland over the FR. The F&amp;MJR opened for passenger traffic 6 June 1867; it was worked by the Midland. In 1867, the FR secured an act of Parliament for the construction of the Hincaster Branch from to the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway at Hincaster. This single-track line was intended to shorten the distance to Barrow for the coke traffic over Stainmore. In 1870, the FR brought forward, and then abandoned, a bill authorising abandonment of the project; construction was pursued with no great urgency, the line not opening until June 1876.

====Lines in the West Cumberland ore-field====
The FR objected when in 1877 the Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway agreed terms for its amalgamation with the LNWR; instead as of July 1879 the WC&amp;ER became a joint line of the Furness and the LNWR. The FR also bought shares in the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway, and worked the main line of the C&amp;WJR.

===Development of Barrow===
The Furness Railway&#x27;s prosperity came originally from the export of haematite ore, but the growth of heavy industry at Barrow became a significant contributor. In 1867, &quot;The Engineer&quot; explained why the demand for Furness haematite had formerly been limited:

It had been reported that in 1856, 464,823 tons of iron ore were raised in Furness &quot;of which 445,013 tons were carried over the Furness Railway and shipped at Barrow, 16,290 on the Ulverston canal, and 3,550 consumed at the Charcoal Iron Furnaces and at the Low Furness Iron and Steel Works. Of the ore carried over the Furness line 200,000 tons are sent to Wales, and the remainder to the Staffordshire, Cleveland and West Riding Iron districts.&quot;

A very small village at Barrow grew into one of about 2,000 serving the ore-export facility there, with the Furness Railway effectively responsible for the settlement. The FR took over Barrow Harbour from its commissioners in 1863 to allow the construction of wet docks at Barrow; in 1864 it obtained powers to supply Barrow and the surrounding district with gas and water.

Barrow grew rapidly in the 1860s, as &quot;The Engineer&quot; noted:

It gave two reasons: 

The first blast furnaces had been brought into operation at Barrow in 1859. Proximity to mines, and to Barrow harbour, and &quot;the advantage of obtaining coke and coal as return freights from the places to which hematite ore was carried&quot; had allowed &quot;extraordinary economy and consequent commercial success.&quot;:
 
Witnesses for the Furness and Midland Joint Bill reported that in 1862 over 535,000 tons of iron ore had been raised in Furness (in 1873 the market price of haematite ore was 24-30 shillings per ton) and over 90,000 tons of pig iron produced in local blast furnaces.

In 1860, there were four blast furnaces in operation at Barrow, with the number increasing to seven in 1862, ten in 1866, and eleven in 1867. The Barrow Hematite Steel Company operating what was then &quot;the largest Bessemer steel works in the country&quot; and &quot;one of the largest in the world&quot;. The Dukes of Devonshire and Buccleuch were both major shareholders in the steel company as was the managing director of the Furness Railway, who was also the managing director of the Hematite Steel Company and (following the incorporation in 1867 of Barrow) its first mayor. (Similarly, after the Phoenix Park Murders, Lord Frederick Cavendish was said to have been a director of the Furness Railway, the Barrow Hematite Steel Company, the Barrow Jute and Flax Company, and the Barrow Shipbuilding Company.)

The docks at Barrow opened in September 1867. There were two wet docks; the Devonshire (30 acres) and the Buccleuch (33 acres). The Midland Railway&#x27;s Morecambe-Belfast steamer service was replaced by a Barrow-Belfast service jointly owned by the Midland and the FR; a service to Douglas was also run in the summer months, but both services ran from Piel pier transferring to Barrow docks in 1881. In 1872, the FR obtained powers to build a third dock (the Ramsden); the spoil from the excavation of this was used to enclose an area of water intended for the construction of a fourth (the Cavendish).

The original main line did not run through Barrow, though its headquarters and engineering works were adjacent to St. George&#x27;s Square. Through trains had to run into the terminal station and then out again to continue their journey. In 1882, through working became possible when a new station called Barrow Central was opened on a new loop line; the Whitehaven-Carnforth passenger traffic now started to running over this section. The old station at the dockside was retained as the goods station.

=== Issues with development outside Barrow ===
Heavy expenditure on the docks at Barrow coincided with a down-turn in the iron trade in the mid-1870s; capital expenditure on other projects was minimised, and the dividend was cut from 10% to 6.5%. This triggered complaints from shareholders that the directors were pursuing the development of Barrow at the expense of the profitability of the FR, and from passengers at the service provided – with the possible exception of fast trains serving Barrow (which did not stop at most stations) FR passenger trains were infrequent, inconvenient, unpunctual, uncomfortable, and slow.

The company chairman (the Duke of Devonshire) subsequently conceded that several of the stations &quot;... until lately, were in a condition of which the public had a right to complain ... On the Whitehaven section especially some of the stations were of the most inferior description, and such as the Board of Trade would not have allowed them to continue; they were mere temporary structure, scarcely more than wooden hovels.&quot;

===Hard times===
In 1881, revenue for the second half of the year was about £300,000 and the dividend 7% a year; second-half revenue declined to £216,000 in 1885 (with the dividend being cut to 2%), but recovered to £275,000 in 1889, allowing a dividend of 5% a year. In 1892, there was no dividend for the first year-half (because of a prolonged strike in the Durham coalfield) this triggered a renewal of previous complaints from shareholders that the company had sunk between two and three million pounds into docks at Barrow, but refused to give any indication of the profitability (or otherwise) of the docks. The additional complaint was now made that most of the directors were ornamental and deferred to Sir James Ramsden who had held managerial posts with the company since 1846, and had been the managing director since 1866. For the second half of 1892, despite the disruption to traffic and loss of an engine caused by subsidence at Lindal, a dividend at the rate of 3% a year was declared; amendments seeking to force the resignation of Sir James were moved, but defeated.

The secretary of the FR denied that its low dividends were caused by injudicious expenditure on Barrow docks; without them there would be no dividend at all: &quot;The docks have led to the development of many industries in Barrow and the establishment of many feeders to our line&quot;. The problem was foreign competition: &quot;..the introduction of Spanish ore into England has led to a serious diminution of the receipts of the Furness Railway company owing to the reduction in price it has affected all over the country in pig iron and steel; and whereas we used to send away nearly half a million tons of ore to Middlesbrough and other places at rates which gave us an average of 3s. a ton, we are now carrying that ore – in less quantities, I am sorry to say – to the furnaces at short distances, and we get an average of only 1s. a ton, Therefore it is not the docks which have reduced our dividends, but the introduction of Spanish ore and the altered circumstances of the trade.&quot; In 1894, it was reported that only 33 of the 75 blast furnaces in Furness and West Cumberland were working.

===Management changes===
In May 1895, Sir James Ramsden, by now 73, resigned due to ill health. He was not replaced as managing director. A new general manager (Alfred Aslett) was recruited from the Cambrian Railways, where he had &#x27;worked wonders ... from being one of the most sluggish it has become one of the most enterprising lines in the kingdom&#x27;. The incumbent &#x27;secretary and general manager&#x27; became &#x27;secretary&#x27; only (his assistant, Ramsden&#x27;s son, became &#x27;superintendent of the line&#x27;) before retiring in 1897 after thirty-three years in the post; the locomotive superintendent retired at the same time after forty-six years with the company.

The new regime benefited from a recovery in the Furness iron and steel trade, and from a wholesale replacement of passenger rolling stock occasioned by the need to provide a continuous automatic brake, but also made strenuous efforts to develop passenger traffic, with day and weekend excursion tickets being introduced and advertised. Second class was abolished (1897) and new corridor bogie carriages introduced on Barrow-Yorkshire services were as good as anything to be found on major railways.

To promote tourist traffic, the FR published guides to tours in the Lake District not only in English, but also in French and German. By 1903, passenger revenue was 40% higher than that for 1895, and passenger revenue per train-mile was 10d higher. The &quot;Railway Magazine&quot; of August 1898 described the Furness Railway as one &quot;which, though a comparatively small line, is noted for its enterprise and go-ahead management.&quot;; by the second half of 1899 the dividend had recovered to 4% per annum, &quot;entirely due to the ability an exertions of their excellent general manager&quot; according to the company chairman. The dividend, however, fell back to 0.5% in 1904 because of a renewed depression in iron and steel; Mr Aslett having previously reported that pig iron could only be produced in Furness at a loss of 3s 6d per ton: England was the &#x27;dumping ground&#x27; for German iron being sold at below its production cost. Vickers had taken over the Barrow Shipbuilding Company in 1897, and its construction of naval warships at Barrow (both as part of the Anglo-German naval arms race and for foreign navies) became an important prop of the prosperity of Barrow. Even with this prop, and the development of tourist traffic, the FR dividend for the last twenty-five years of its existence (up to Grouping in 1923) averaged only marginally above 2% a year.

===Relationship with the Midland Railway===
The FR had been closely associated with the Midland Railway for many years; it was strategically important to the Midland as giving it access to an Irish Sea port and hence to Irish traffic. The Midland had repeatedly attempted to purchase the company, but these offers had come during periods of prosperity for the Furness, whose directors had rebuffed the Midland&#x27;s terms as insufficiently generous. The Midland&#x27;s announcement of a planned extension of its Morecambe line to a new deep-water port at Heysham gave rise to concern about the future of steamer services from Barrow and the reliability of the Midland as a partner.

Negotiations with the Midland led to a further offer to purchase the FR (with a guaranteed 3% dividend to FR shareholders) which was again rejected, and ended in an agreement that the joint Furness/Midland trains from Barrow would continue to run, and the same company which managed (and owned a third of the shares in) the Barrow trains for the railways would also manage the services from Heysham. When services began running from Heysham in 1905, the Barrow services became unprofitable: it became evident that the Midland was preferentially routing traffic via Heysham and the Furness went to law, the matter being resolved by the Midland buying out the FR&#x27;s interest for £45,000, entering a traffic-sharing agreement for Belfast traffic and undertaking to continue the services from Barrow for seven years.

==Locomotives==

The first locomotive superintendent, recruited from Bury, Curtis and Kennedy in 1846, was later to be knighted as Sir James Ramsden, a leading civic figure and first Mayor of Barrow. No locomotives were actually built in the local works itself: they were generally standard designs, purchased from other manufacturers. By 1921, fifteen different works were represented. However, W. F. Pettigrew, who had taken over operations in 1896, was to introduce some measure of standardisation.

There were also carriage and wagon-building shops, and repairs and maintenance was carried out on the equipment of Barrow Docks.

==Line details==
* Viaducts: The line crosses several major estuaries - the rivers Kent and Leven being among them - over substantial viaducts.
* Tunnel: the &quot;Bransty Tunnel&quot; in Whitehaven is in length
* Total mileage (lines owned or worked) (1912): .

==Barrow Docks==

Details given are those shown for 1912:
* Total area of water: 
* Four docks: &quot;Devonshire&quot;; &quot;Buccleuch&quot;; &quot;Ramsden&quot;; and &quot;Cavendish&quot;. There was also a Timber Dock.
* Length of quays 
* Messrs Vickers built major ships for the Royal Navy here
* There was also a deep water berth in &quot;Walney Channel&quot;

<text>Mark Julian Byford (born 13 June 1958) was Deputy Director-General of the BBC and head of BBC journalism from 2004 to 2011. He chaired the BBC Journalism Board and was a member of the BBC Executive Board for thirteen years.

His responsibilities also included BBC Sport, the nations and regions (BBC Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and English regions) and editorial policy. He led the BBC-wide coverage of the general elections in 2005 and 2010; the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008; and the BBC coverage of the Queen Mother&#x27;s Funeral in 2002 and the Royal Wedding in 2011.

Byford established and chaired the BBC&#x27;s Editorial Standards Board, which was responsible for promoting the BBC&#x27;s standards in ethics and programme-making across the corporation. He also established and chaired the Complaints Management Board, which oversaw the handling of complaints across the BBC. In addition, he was the chair of the BBC Academy Board co-ordinating all its training and development. He was in overall charge of the BBC&#x27;s planning for the London 2012 Olympic Games as chair of the London 2012 Steering Group.

==Early life==
Byford was born in Castleford, Yorkshire. He spent his early years living around the West Riding of Yorkshire, where his father, Sir Lawrence Byford, served as a policeman. Sir Lawrence went on to become Chief Constable of Lincolnshire, and later, Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary. Mark was educated at Lincoln School which later became Lincoln Christ&#x27;s Hospital Comprehensive School.&lt;ref name=&quot;christs-hospital.lincs/alumni&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to West Yorkshire in 1976, studying law at the University of Leeds, where he was president of Devonshire Hall. Immediately on graduating he joined the BBC in 1979, aged 20, as a &quot;temporary holiday relief assistant&quot; working as a researcher over the summer holiday in his local (&quot;Look North&quot;) television newsroom in Leeds. After three months&#x27; vacation work, he joined the BBC full-time.

==Career with the BBC==
In 1981, aged 22, he produced the Royal Television Society&#x27;s Regional News Programme of the Year – a &quot;BBC Look North&quot; special on unemployment in the North of England.

The following year, in 1982, he produced the award-winning edition again – this time with &quot;South Today&quot; in Southampton. In 1987 he became head of news at BBC Bristol before becoming home editor BBC News and current affairs, responsible for all television network newsgathering coverage across the UK. There he led the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Clapham rail crash, the Kegworth M1 air crash, the Lockerbie bombing, the Hillsborough football tragedy, and the &quot;Marchioness&quot; riverboat disaster. In 1990 he returned to Leeds as head of centre. In 1991 he became controller of regional broadcasting.

He joined the BBC&#x27;s board of management in 1996 as Director, Regional Broadcasting, responsible for the BBC&#x27;s activities in the UK outside London. In 1997–98, he drew up the BBC&#x27;s response to devolution and helped to devise and implement the policy to increase the level of network programming production outside London. In 1998 he became director of the BBC World Service and then head of the BBC&#x27;s multi-media global news division in 2002.

In January 2004 he became Deputy Director-General of the BBC but within three weeks of his appointment, Greg Dyke resigned as Director-General, following the publication of the Hutton Report. Byford was appointed by the Board of Governors as Acting Director-General, a role that he undertook for five months. During this period, Byford had a lead role in producing &quot;Building Public Value&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s Charter renewal manifesto.

When Mark Thompson was appointed Director-General of the BBC in June 2004, Byford&#x27;s role was enlarged to take responsibility for all the BBC&#x27;s journalism at UK, international and local levels – the first time such a post had been established. In July 2006 he also became responsible for BBC Sport.

In June 2008 the BBC&#x27;s governing body, the BBC Trust, in a direct criticism of BBC News, instructed Byford and his editors to &quot;improve the range, clarity and precision of its network coverage of the different UK nations and regions&quot;. The Trust said the BBC was &quot;falling short of its own high standards&quot; and, in part, failing to meet its core purpose of helping inform democracy. Three years later, Professor Anthony King, the author of the original report for the Trust, said there &quot;had been enormous change in how the BBC reported the devolved nations. They make many fewer mistakes than they used to.&quot;

As chair of the BBC&#x27;s Editorial Standards Board, Byford led the executive response to the faked competitions scandals that engulfed the BBC in 2007, including designing the special training programme Safeguarding Trust which more than 17,000 members of staff had to attend. In November 2008, he led the investigation into the Brand/Ross affair and produced the special report that was published subsequently by the BBC Trust.

He is a fellow of The Radio Academy. He was a first board member of the joint industry radio research body, RAJAR, in the early 1990s and was also a board member of BARB, the television audience research body. He was a trustee of the &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity from 1992 to 1996. In 1999, he established the BBC World Service Trust, the BBC&#x27;s international development charity, which used media and communications to reduce poverty and promote education and human rights around the world.

In July 2010, it was revealed that Byford had flown on business to the World Cup in South Africa, business class at a cost of £4,878. This came against a background of further cuts in BBC News, for which Byford was responsible. On 12 October 2010 it was announced Byford was leaving the corporation after thirty-two years and the Deputy Director-General post closed as part of the BBC&#x27;s cutbacks in senior management costs. He had accepted voluntary redundancy. He stood down from the Executive Board in March 2011 and left the corporation in June 2011. Byford left the Executive Board of the BBC at the end of March 2011, and his BBC employment ended in the early summer after he led the Royal Wedding coverage, reportedly with a redundancy/notice package of between £800,000 and £900,000.

On his retirement &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented: &quot;If he has a public profile at all it is because Byford came to symbolise the apparent excesses of top executive pay at the corporation. There he was, grey man with a job for life, half a million pounds in salary and, because he had been at the BBC so long without ever leaving, an uncapped two-thirds final salary pension entitlement and no obvious market rate comparator to justify such riches. It was very easy to put the question, as even many lower ranking BBC staff did – who else would pay Mark Byford £500,000 and for what? – knowing there was no very good answer.&quot; However, the remainder of that article, written by media commentator Steve Hewlett, suggested that his presence might be missed greatly at the BBC. &quot;He made things happen and by common consent brought a firm moral sense to everything he did, rising above his own particular interests.&quot; It went on to highlight how he was a stabilising influence on Director-General Mark Thompson. That opinion appeared highly prophetic in the light of the two major &quot;Newsnight&quot; scandals – concerning Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine respectively – which engulfed the BBC within 18 months of Byford&#x27;s departure. Both of those incidents led to widespread adverse criticism of high level management of journalism within the BBC and were surrounded by suggestions that the Director-General of the day was not sufficiently informed about issues highly significant for the BBC&#x27;s reputation.

The subsequent Pollard Review highlighted that several witnesses had said &quot;they believe the Savile affair and, in particular, the BBC&#x27;s poor handling of it after the investigation was halted, would not have happened if the role of Deputy Director-General occupied by Mark Byford had still been in existence.&quot;

Media commentators agreed with that view. Professor Stewart Purvis said: &quot;He watched the DG&#x27;s back and he watched the BBC&#x27;s back. Margaret Thatcher once declared: &quot;Every Prime Minister needs a Willie (Whitelaw). Now the chorus is growing that every DG needs a Mark B.&quot; Peter Preston described him as: &quot;a news aware Deputy, a safety net, a mopper up of perilous trifles.&quot;

==Later career==

After leaving the BBC, Byford became a writer of non-fiction. His first book, &quot;A Name On A Wall: Two Men, Two Wars, Two Destinies&quot; was published by Mainstream in 2013. It tells the contrasting stories of an American soldier, Larry Byford, killed in the Vietnam War in 1967 and his own father, Lawry Byford, who served alongside the Americans in the Second World War. Jan C. Scruggs, the President and Founder of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, described it as &quot;an amazing journey that unfolded as a mission. An extraordinary experience like nothing ever done before in America. It&#x27;s important. It matters.&quot; Julian Pettifer wrote &quot;This tale should be compulsory reading for MPs and military leaders and anyone else who might lead us into armed conflict. An absorbing and meticulously researched work.&quot;

His second book, &quot;The Annunciation: A Pilgrim&#x27;s Quest&quot;, was published by Winchester University Press in April 2018. Inspired by an Annunciation painting by François Lemoyne in the National Gallery, on loan from Winchester College, he searches for the spiritual meaning of the biblical story through conversations with senior clerics, theologians and art historians, as well as looking at Annunciation images.

He was a lay canon and member of chapter at Winchester Cathedral from 2017 to 2024 (resigning 20 June 2024). He has been a governor of the University of Winchester since 2014; a trustee of the Winchester Hospice Fundraising Charity since 2018; and a trustee of Play to the Crowd, the charity that runs Winchester Theatre Royal and the Hat Fair, since 2018. He was made a vice president of the RNLI in 2019 in recognition of his outstanding contribution as a trustee from 2012 to 2019.

==Personal life==
He is married to Hilary Bleiker, whom he met whilst at Leeds University where she studied English, and they have five adult children, two sons and three daughters. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree by the University of Leeds in 2008. He and his family live in Winchester. In 2006 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Winchester, and in 2010 an honorary doctorate by the University of Lincoln, the city where he spent his teenage years.

<doc id="564125" wikidata="Q380872" url="?curid=564125" title="Al Martino">
<text>Jasper Cini (October 7, 1927 – October 13, 2009), known professionally as Al Martino, was an American traditional pop and jazz singer. He had his greatest success as a singer between the early 1950s and mid-1970s, being described as &quot;one of the great Italian American pop crooners&quot;, and became known as an actor, particularly for his role as singer Johnny Fontane in &quot;The Godfather&quot;.

==Early life==
Jasper Cini was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Gasparino (also anglicised as &quot;Jasper&quot;; 1905–1958) and Carmela M. Cini (; 1905–1998), one of five siblingsthe others being Pasquale, Rita, Frances and Frank. His father and maternal grandfather were immigrants from Nereto, in the Italian region of Abruzzo. He aspired to become a singer, emulating artists such as Al Jolson and Perry Como, and seeing the success of a family friend, Alfredo Cocozza, who had changed his name to Mario Lanza.

==Career==
After serving with the U.S. Navy in World War II, during which he took part in the Iwo Jima invasion, in which he was wounded, Cini began his singing career. Encouraged by Lanza, he adopted the stage name Al Martino, based on the name of his good friend Lorraine Losavio&#x27;s husband Alfred Martin Cianfrani, and began singing in local nightclubs; coincidentally Martin of Tours is also the patron saint of Martino&#x27;s ancestral hometown of Nereto in Italy. In 1948, he moved to New York City, and in 1951 his first release was issued by the Jubilee label, &quot;Heaven Help Me (I&#x27;m in Love)&quot;, coupled with &quot;Hurry Home to Me&quot;. The following year, he won first place on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; television program with a performance of Como&#x27;s hit &quot;If&quot;.
As a result, he won a recording contract with the Philadelphia-based independent record label BBS, where he recorded &quot;Here in My Heart&quot;. Lanza&#x27;s label, RCA Victor, had asked Lanza to record the song, but Martino called Lanza and pleaded with him to let Martino&#x27;s version have a clear chance. The song spent three weeks at No. 1 on the US pop chart in June 1952, earning Martino a gold disc, and later in the year, it was number one in the first UK Singles Chart, published by the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; on November 14, 1952, putting him into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. &quot;Here in My Heart&quot; remained in the top position for nine weeks in the UK.

The record&#x27;s success led to a deal with Capitol Records, and he released three more singles: &quot;Take My Heart&quot;, &quot;Rachel&quot;, and &quot;When You&#x27;re Mine&quot; through 1953, all of which hit the U.S. top 40. However, his success also attracted the attention of the Mafia, which bought out Martino&#x27;s management contract and ordered him to pay $75,000 as a safeguard for their investment. After making a down-payment to appease them, he moved to Britain. His popularity allowed him to continue to perform and record successfully in the UK, headlining at the London Palladium and having six further British chart hits in the period up to 1955, including &quot;Now&quot; and &quot;Wanted&quot;. However, his work received no exposure back in the US. 

In 1958, after the intervention of a family friend, Martino was allowed to return to the U.S. and resume his recording career, but he faced difficulties in re-establishing himself, especially with the arrival of rock and roll. In 1959, Martino signed with 20th Century Fox Records; his deal scored him two albums, and four singles released, none of which was a major hit. The success of his 1962 album &quot;The Exciting Voice of Al Martino&quot; secured him a new contract with Capitol, and was followed by a mostly Italian-language album, &quot;The Italian Voice of Al Martino&quot;, which featured his version of the then internationally popular song &quot;Al di là&quot;. He also made several high-profile television appearances, helping to re-establish his visibility.

In 1963, he had his biggest U.S. chart success with &quot;I Love You Because&quot;, a cover of Leon Payne&#x27;s 1950 country music hit. Arranged by Belford Hendricks, Martino&#x27;s version went to number three on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Easy Listening chart. The album of the same name went top 10 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Martino had four other U.S. top 10 hits in 1963 and 1964 — &quot;Painted, Tainted Rose&quot; (1963), &quot;I Love You More and More Every Day&quot;, &quot;Tears and Roses&quot;, and &quot;Silver Bells&quot; (all 1964). He also sang the title song for the 1964 film, &quot;Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;. One of his biggest hits was &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot;, achieving several gold and platinum discs for sales. Recorded in 1965, the song reached number five on the UK Singles chart when reissued in 1973. The song, with a tune by Bert Kaempfert originally titled &quot;Moon Over Naples&quot;, is among the 50 most-played songs worldwide.

Martino&#x27;s run of chart success faded after the mid-1960s, although many of his records continued to reach the U.S. Hot 100. Another later hit was a disco version of &quot;Volare&quot;, (also known as &quot;Nel blu, Dipinto di Blu&quot;). In 1976, it reached number one on the Italian and Flemish charts, and was in the top 10 in Spain, the Netherlands, and France, as well as in many other European countries. In 1993, Martino recorded a new studio album with German producer Dieter Bohlen (former member of pop duo Modern Talking, producer of international artists such as Chris Norman of Smokie, Bonnie Tyler, Dionne Warwick, Engelbert or Errol Brown of Hot Chocolate). The single &quot;Spanish Ballerina&quot; (written in Bohlen&#x27;s europop sound) reached number 93 in the German single charts.

=== Acting ===
Apart from singing, Martino played the role of Johnny Fontane in the 1972 film &quot;The Godfather&quot;, as well as singing the film&#x27;s theme, &quot;Speak Softly Love&quot;. Martino had been told about the character by a friend who had read the eponymous novel and felt Martino represented the character of Johnny Fontane. Martino contacted producer Albert S. Ruddy, who initially gave him the part. Martino was stripped of the part, however, after Francis Ford Coppola came on board as director and awarded the role to singer Vic Damone. Martino, in turn, went to Russell Bufalino, his godfather and a crime boss, who then orchestrated the publication of various news articles that claimed Coppola had been unaware of Ruddy having given Martino the part. 

Damone eventually dropped the role because he did not want to provoke the Bufalino crime family (in addition, Damone felt he was being paid too little for the role). Ultimately, the part of Johnny Fontane was given to Martino. He played the same role in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; and &quot;The Godfather Trilogy: 1901–1980&quot; (the television miniseries that combines &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; into one film).

Martino later returned to acting, playing aging crooner Sal Stevens in the short film &quot;Cutout&quot;, which appeared in film festivals around the world in 2006.

==Personal life==
Martino was married first to Jenny Furini; then to Gwendolyn Wenzel; and, finally, to Judi Stilwell, to whom he was married at the time of his death. He had four children: Alfred Cini, Dana MacIsaac, Alana Cini, and Alison Martino. The latter is a writer and television producer of such programs as &quot;Mysteries and Scandals&quot; and &quot;Headliners and Legends&quot;.

==Death==
Martino died from a heart attack on October 13, 2009, at his home in Springfield, Pennsylvania, six days after his 82nd birthday. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<doc id="564127" wikidata="Q3997890" url="?curid=564127" title="Caledonian Railway">
<text>The Caledonian Railway (CR) was a major Scottish railway company. It was formed in 1845 with the objective of forming a link between English railways and Glasgow. It progressively extended its network and reached Edinburgh and Aberdeen, with a dense network of branch lines in the area surrounding Glasgow. It was absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Many of its principal routes are still used, and the original main line between Carlisle and Glasgow is in use as part of the West Coast Main Line railway (with a modified entry into Glasgow itself).

==Introduction==
In the mid-1830s, railways in England evolved from local concerns to longer routes that connected cities, and then became networks. In Scotland it was clear that this was the way forward, and there was a desire to connect the Central Belt to the incipient English network. There was controversy over the route that such a line might take, but the Caledonian Railway was formed on 31 July 1845 and it opened its main line between Glasgow, Edinburgh and Carlisle in 1848, making an alliance with the English London and North Western Railway which connected Carlisle to the English Midlands and London. In the obituary of the engineer Richard Price-Williams written in 1916 the contractor of the Caledonian Railway is stated to be Thomas Brassey and the civil engineer George Heald.

Although the company was supported by Scottish investors, more than half of its shares were held in England.

Establishing itself as an intercity and cross-border railway, the Caledonian set about securing territory by leasing other authorised or newly built lines, and fierce competition developed with other, larger Scottish railways, particularly the North British Railway and the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The company established primacy in some areas, but remained less than successful in others; considerable sums were expended in the process, not always finding the approval of shareholders.

A considerable steamer passenger traffic developed on the Firth of Clyde serving island resorts, and fast boat trains were run from Glasgow to steamer piers; the company was refused permission to operate its own steamers, and it formed a partnership with a nominally independent, but friendly, operator, the Caledonian Steam Packet Company.

In 1923 the railways of Great Britain were &quot;grouped&quot; under the Railways Act 1921 and the Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the newly formed London Midland and Scottish Railway; its capitalisation at that time was £57 million (equivalent to £ today), and it had a single-track mileage of .

It extended from Aberdeen to Portpatrick, and from Oban to Carlisle, running express passenger services and a heavy mineral traffic.

==Early history==
===The Lanarkshire coal lines===
In the closing years of the 18th century, the pressing need to bring coal cheaply to Glasgow from the plentiful Monklands coalfield had been met by the construction of the Monkland Canal, opened throughout in 1794. This encouraged development of the coalfield, but dissatisfaction at the monopoly prices said to be exacted by the canal led to the construction of the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway (M&amp;KR), Scotland&#x27;s first public railway; it opened in 1826. Development of the use of blackband ironstone by David Mushet, and the invention of the hot blast process of iron smelting by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, led to a huge and rapid increase in iron production and demand for iron ore and coal in the Coatbridge area.

The industrial development led to the construction of other railways contiguous with the M&amp;KR, in particular the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway and the Wishaw and Coltness Railway. These two lines worked in harmony, merging to form the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway in 1841, and competing with the M&amp;KR and its allies. All these lines used the local track gauge of , and they were referred to as &quot;the coal lines&quot;; passenger traffic was not a dominant activity.

===English railways===

During this period, the first long-distance railways were opened in England; the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first intercity line, opened in 1830 and was an immediate success. It was quickly followed by the Grand Junction Railway in 1837, the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838 and the North Union Railway reaching Preston in 1838, so that London was linked with the Lancashire and West Midlands centres of industry.

===Connecting Scotland and London===
It was clearly desirable to connect central Scotland into the emerging network. At first it was assumed that only one route from Scotland to England would be feasible, and there was considerable controversy over the possible route. A major difficulty was the terrain of the Southern Uplands: a route running through the hilly lands would involve steep and lengthy gradients that were challenging for the engine power of the time; a route around them, either to the west or the east, involved much lengthier main lines, and made connection to both Edinburgh and Glasgow more problematic.
Many competing schemes were put forward, not all of them well thought out, and two successive government commissions examined them. However, they did not have mandatory force, and after considerable rivalry, the Caledonian Railway obtained an authorising act of Parliament, the (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. clxii), on 31 July 1845, for lines from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle. The share capital was to be £1,800,000 (equivalent to £ today).

The Glasgow and Edinburgh lines combined at Carstairs in Clydesdale, and the route then crossed over Beattock Summit and continued on through Annandale. The promoters had engaged in a frenzy of provisional acquisitions of other lines being put forward or already being constructed, as they considered it was vital to secure territory to their own control and to exclude competing concerns as far as possible. It was not the only Anglo-Scottish route; the North British Railway opened its coastal route between Edinburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed on 22 June 1846, forming part of what has become the East Coast Main Line. The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway had opened in 1841 with the declared intention of reaching Carlisle by way of Dumfries; it did so in 1850, changing its name then to the Glasgow and South Western Railway.

===The main line===
The main line was opened from Carlisle to Beattock on 10 September 1847, and throughout between Glasgow and Carlisle on 15 February 1848. A continuous railway route between Glasgow and London existed for the first time. (It had been possible to travel via Edinburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne since 1846, but this involved crossing the River Tweed at Berwick by road, and the River Tyne at Gateshead / Newcastle by congested road bridge or ferry.)

The Caledonian Railway&#x27;s Edinburgh line from Carstairs opened on 1 April 1848. The terminal at Edinburgh was at Lothian Road. Glasgow was reached over the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway (successor to the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway), and the Wishaw and Coltness Railway, which the Caledonian had leased from 1 January 1847 and 1 January 1846 respectively. The Glasgow station was the Townhead terminus of the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway.

During the process of seeking Parliamentary authorisation, the Caledonian observed that the Clydesdale Junction Railway was being promoted. The Caledonian acquired that line during its construction, and it opened in 1849. It gave an alternative and shorter access to another Glasgow passenger terminal, named South Side, and to the Clyde quays at General Terminus (over the connected General Terminus and Glasgow Harbour Railway). The South Side station was already being used by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, worked by the Caledonian. One day, they hoped, they might extend that line into Ayrshire. Meanwhile, the line was leased (for 999 years) to the Caledonian in 1849.

The Caledonian recognised that the Townhead terminus was unsatisfactory and constructed a deviation from Milton Junction to a new Glasgow terminus at Buchanan Street. It opened on 1 November 1849. Trains to Edinburgh, Stirling and Carlisle used the new station; the Stirling trains had to reverse at Gartsherrie Junction. The Garnkirk&#x27;s old Glebe Street (Townhead) station was reduced to goods and mineral duties. In 1853–54 the Hayhill Fork, between Gartcosh and Garnqueen, was opened, enabling direct running from Buchanan Street towards Stirling.

===Financial problems, and Greenock amalgamation===
In the period between formation of the Caledonian Railway and the opening of the main line, a large number of leases and working arrangements had been concluded with other railways being promoted or built nearby. This was mostly done by guaranteeing those shareholders an income on their capital, which meant no immediate cash was required. When the lines started working, suddenly a huge periodical payment was required, and the income was inadequate to satisfy it. There were also suggestions of improper share acquisitions, and in the period 1848 to 1850 a number of shareholder inquiries disclosed bad practices, and many board members had to resign in February 1850.

The company had obtained Parliamentary powers to merge with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway (GP&amp;GR) in 1847, but even more alarming revelations of financial impropriety emerged regarding that company, and the Caledonian considered getting authorisation to cancel the amalgamation. However, it was later decided to proceed, and the amalgamation took place by an act of Parliament of 7 August 1851. The GP&amp;GR operated the line between Glasgow and Paisley jointly with the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&amp;SWR), and the Paisley line used a terminus at Bridge Street in Glasgow.

The Caledonian now worked trains at three termini in Glasgow: Buchanan Street, South Side (from the Clydesdale Junction line, mostly used for local trains to Motherwell and Hamilton), and Bridge Street (on the Paisley line).

Gradually the financial difficulties were got under control, by economy, and by the discovery that several of the lease agreements were illegal. Handsome dividends continued to be paid, but it was not until March 1853 that the dividend was paid wholly from revenue.

===South Lanarkshire: mainly mineral traffic===

If the Caledonian Railway had been formed as an intercity trunk line, its attention was early on turned to other demands. Local interests in Lanark promoted a branch line to their town, opening in 1855. Coal owners in South Lanarkshire pressed for a railway connection, and the Lesmahagow Railway was formed by them, opening in 1856. It was later absorbed by the Caledonian, but other lines followed in the sparsely populated but mineral-rich area. As new coal mines opened, so new branches were needed, connecting Coalburn, Stonehouse, Strathaven, Muirkirk and Darvel and many other places, with new lines built right up until 1905. When the coal became exhausted in the second half of the 20th century, the railways were progressively closed; passenger traffic had always been light and it too disappeared. Only the passenger traffic to the Lanark and Larkhall branches remain in operation.

===North Lanarkshire===

In North Lanarkshire, the North British Railway was a keen competitor, having taken over the Monkland Railways. The area contained the rapidly-growing iron production area surrounding Coatbridge, and servicing that industry with coal and iron ore, and transport to local and more distant metal processing locations, dominated the Caledonian&#x27;s activity in the region. The Rutherglen and Coatbridge line, later linking Airdrie, and the Carfin to Midcalder line were routes with significant passenger traffic. Many lines to coal and iron ore pits further east were built, but serving remote areas the lines closed when the mineral extraction ceased.

==Developing the network: to 1880==
===Busby and East Kilbride===

With the Barrhead line in full operation, interests in Busby wanted a railway connection. The wealthy middle class saw the town as an elegant location and the Busby Railway opened in 1866. Commuting was already in fashion. The line was extended to East Kilbride in 1868, although at that time the then small village did not generate much business for the railway.

===Branches south of Carstairs===
When the main line was built, no branches were provided in the thinly populated terrain of the Southern Uplands. Four independent companies made branches themselves, and the Caledonian built two.
The Symington, Biggar and Broughton Railway was opened in 1860, having been taken over by the Caledonian during construction. It was extended to Peebles in 1864.

In 1863 an independent line, the Dumfries, Lochmaben and Lockerbie Railway was opened. The line was encouraged by the Caledonian Railway, giving westward access into Dumfriesshire, and worked by it; the Caledonian acquired the line in 1865. The Portpatrick Railway had opened between Castle Douglas and Portpatrick in 1861–62 and the Caledonian Railway worked that railway; it obtained running powers over the G&amp;SWR between Dumfries and Castle Douglas, and at a stroke the Caledonian had penetrated deep into the south-west, and to the ferry service to the north of Ireland, territory that the G&amp;SWR had assumed was its own. The Portpatrick Railway later reformed with the Wigtownshire Railway as the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway; the Caledonian was a one-quarter owner.
The North British Railway opened its branch line to Dolphinton, east of Carstairs, and the Caledonian feared that the next step would be an incursion by the NBR into Caledonian territory, possibly seeking running powers on the main line. To head this off, the Caledonian built its own Dolphinton branch from Carstairs; it opened in 1867. Dolphinton had a population of 260 and two railways, and traffic was correspondingly meagre, and the line closed in 1945 to passengers and in 1950 to goods.

The independent Solway Junction Railway was opened in 1869, linking iron mines in Cumberland with the Caledonian Railway at Kirtlebridge, crossing the Solway Firth by a viaduct; the company worked the line itself. It considerably shortened the route to the Lanarkshire ironworks, and was heavily used at first, but the traffic was depleted by cheap imported iron ore within a decade. The Scottish part of the line was acquired by the Caledonian Railway in 1873, and the whole line in 1895. Serious ice damage and later heavy maintenance costs made the line seriously unprofitable and it was closed in 1921.

==Glasgow Central station==
When the Caledonian&#x27;s first main line opened, it used the Townhead terminus of the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway, and almost simultaneously, it acquired access to the South Side station planned for the Clydesdale Junction Railway. It extended from Townhead to Buchanan Street, an &quot;inadequate and very cramped station&quot; in 1849, but the route from there to the southwards main line was very circuitous. The Caledonian also worked the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway with a terminus at Bridge Street, also inconveniently situated south of the Clyde: the Caledonian, therefore, had three unsatisfactory Glasgow termini.

As early as 1846 proposals to cross the Clyde from Gushetfaulds to a Dunlop Street terminal had been put forward; the idea was killed by fierce opposition from the Clyde Bridges Trust (which would lose toll income) and the Admiralty (who insisted on a swing bridge).
Another scheme failed to get finance in 1866 and again in 1873, but the (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. cxxxiii) was obtained to build a bridge crossing the Clyde and bringing the South Side route into the city centre. A four-track railway bridge crossing the river was designed by Blyth and Cunningham and built by Sir William Arrol &amp; Co.; the Clyde railway bridge was complete on 1 October 1878. The new Glasgow Central station on Gordon Street opened in December 1879. It had eight platforms, but was considered to be unsatisfactory, having narrow platforms; the circulating area was &quot;ridiculously small&quot;; there was no good cab stance and inadequate siding accommodation.

The Bridge Street terminus was jointly operated with the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&amp;SWR); it had to be reconstructed as a through station, and the Greenock line trains (operated by the Caledonian) continued to use it.

A ninth platform was added to Central station in 1889, but a major expansion took place in the years 1901–1906, when the platforms were lengthened and four platforms added on the west side; a second river crossing was provided. In 1904 Bridge Street station was substantially changed to provide carriage washing and stabling facilities; it closed as a passenger station on 1 March 1905. Central station was operated by a single signal box, staffed with ten men. It was commissioned on 3 May 1908; it had 374 miniature levers, the largest of its type in the world, operating points and signals by electro-pneumatic and electro-magnetic equipment.

==Extending the network after 1880==
===Moffat Railway===
The Moffat Railway was opened from Beattock on 2 April 1883. It was just over long. It was worked by the Caledonian and absorbed on 11 November 1889. The Caledonian Railway sought to develop both Moffat and Peebles as watering places, and ran &quot;The Tinto Express&quot; from both places, combining at Symington, to Edinburgh and Glasgow for several years.

With the intention of revitalising the lead mining industry, the Leadhills and Wanlockhead Branch was opened as a light railway from Elvanfoot in 1901–02. With challenging gradients to reach Scotland&#x27;s highest village in otherwise remote territory, the line scraped a bare living and closed in 1938.

===From Greenock to the Firth of Clyde===
In the mid-1850s the steamer connections on the Firth of Clyde assumed ever increasing importance, and journey transit times from settlements in Argyll and the islands to Glasgow became critical. The inconvenient situation of the Greenock station and pier encouraged thoughts of more convenient routes, and in 1862 the Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway was authorised. It was an independent company intending to provide a fast connection from Rothesay on the Isle of Bute; it opened on 13 May 1865 and in August 1893 it amalgamated with the Caledonian Railway, having been operated by the Caledonian Railway since its opening.

In 1889 the Caledonian itself opened an extension line from Greenock to Gourock, more conveniently situated than Greenock; this involved the expensive construction of Newton Street Tunnel, the longest in Scotland.

In competing with rival rail and steamer connections, the Caledonian became frustrated with its reliance on independent steamer operators, and tried to obtain powers to operate the vessels directly; this was refused by Parliament on competition grounds, and in reaction the company founded the nominally independent Caledonian Steam Packet Company in 1889. The CSPC expanded its routes and services considerably; following nationalisation of the railways in 1948 it became owned by British Railways, but was divested in 1968 and later became a constituent of Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac), which remains in state ownership.

===Glasgow and Paisley suburban lines===
In the final decades of the 19th century, as the cities spread into conurbations, the company&#x27;s attention turned to increasing traffic in areas now thought of as &quot;suburban&quot;. Street running tramways were already responding to the demand for passenger travel in these areas, but as yet they used horse traction.

The Cathcart District Railway was promoted as an independent concern but heavily supported by the Caledonian. It opened in 1886 from Pollokshields to Mount Florida and Cathcart (the eastern arm of the present-day Cathcart Circle Line) in 1886, and was extended via Shawlands to form a loop in 1894. It was worked by the Caledonian, although the company retained its independence until 1923.

The Glasgow Central Railway was authorised as an independent company to build a surface line from Rutherglen to Maryhill. It encountered fierce opposition, and the scheme was taken over by the Caledonian and converted into a route mainly in tunnel under Argyle Street. It opened in 1896, further encouraging suburban passenger travel. It closed in 1959 but reopened (as the Argyle Line) in 1979.

The Paisley and Barrhead District Railway was incorporated in 1897 and transferred to the Caledonian in 1902; it was to link Paisley and Barrhead and enable a circular service from Glasgow. The line was substantially ready in 1902 but by now street tramways were electrically operated and eminently successful. It was plain that a passenger service would not be viable against tram competition and the intended passenger service was never started.

===North Clydeside===
The area of the north bank of the river Clyde became increasingly important for industry, and therefore became heavily populated. The North British Railway and its satellites had gained an early monopoly of this traffic, but its importance encouraged the Caledonian to enter the area.

The Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway was nominally independent, running from near Maryhill to Dumbarton, opening progressively between 1894 and 1896. In 1896 the Caledonian gained access to Loch Lomond with the opening of the Dumbarton and Balloch Joint Railway (originally built by the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway), built jointly with the NBR.

===The Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway===
In 1888 the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway opened a line from Giffen on the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway to Ardrossan. Its purpose was to shorten the route for Caledonian mineral traffic, and it was worked by the Caledonian. In 1903–04 it was extended eastwards to Cathcart and Newton, enabling the heavy mineral trains to avoid the Joint Line and the congested area around Gushetfaulds from the Lanarkshire coalfields to Ardrossan Harbour.

==Edinburgh and Lothians==
The Caledonian Railway entered Edinburgh from Carstairs on 15 February 1848; its terminus was a one-platform station named Lothian Road. This was the first line to offer travel without change of carriage between Edinburgh and London: passengers on the rival North British Railway needed to cross the River Tweed on foot to continue their rail journey.

The unsatisfactory Edinburgh terminus needed improvement but funds were limited, and the Caledonian built a short spur to Haymarket; talks had taken place about using the E&amp;GR and NBR station, later named Waverley; but the NBR rejected the idea. Eventually in 1870 the Lothian Road station was much improved and extended, and the new terminus was named Princes Street.
The owner of Granton Harbour encouraged, and half-funded, the construction of a branch from near Lothian Road, and this opened in 1861. A branch from the Granton line to Leith Docks was made in 1864. This line was opened to passengers from 1879: the Leith terminal was later renamed Leith North. After 1900 the port authorities built new modern docks to the east of the former Leith docks, and the Caledonian further extended its Leith line to reach the new facilities: the Leith New Lines opened in 1903. It had been planned to open a passenger service on the line, and passenger stations had been built, but tram competition made it clear that an inner suburban passenger railway was unviable and the passenger service was never inaugurated.

The Edinburgh main line passed close to numerous mineral workings, and several short branches and connections were made to collieries, iron workings and shale oil plants. The Wilsontown branch from Auchengray, opened in 1860 was the most significant, and carried a passenger service.

The original Wishaw and Coltness Railway, now leased by the Caledonian, had long since reached Cleland ironworks from the west, and in 1869 the line was extended from near there to Midcalder Junction on the Edinburgh main line, passing through Shotts, Fauldhouse and Midcalder. This line connected to many further mines and industrial sites, and gave the Caledonian a passenger route between Glasgow and Edinburgh that competed with the North British Railway&#x27;s route through Falkirk.

The first main line had bypassed a considerable centre of industry located on the Water of Leith southwest of Edinburgh, and a branch line to Balerno opened on 1 August 1874. The line was successful in encouraging residential building, especially at Colinton, and also leisure excursions: for a time it was known as &quot;the picnic line&quot;, but it too succumbed to more convenient transport facilities by road, and it closed to passengers in 1943.

Speculative residential development encouraged the construction of a line to Barnton, west of Edinburgh. The branch line opened on 1 March 1894; the terminus was named Cramond Brig at first. The Caledonian intended to make the line into a loop, returning to the city by way of Corstorphine, but this idea was shelved.

==Stirling, Perth, Callander and Crieff==
The Caledonian Railway had intended to lease, or absorb, the Scottish Central Railway (SCR), which obtained its act of Parliament, the Scottish Central Railway Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. clxi), on the same day as the Caledonian. The SCR needed a partner railway to get access to Glasgow and Edinburgh, but the rival Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&amp;GR) would provide that. The SCR opened from Greenhill Junction with the E&amp;GR to Perth on 22 May 1848, and the Caledonian opened its branch to reach Greenhill Junction on 7 August 1848. The SCR remained independent for some time, mainly because of Parliamentary opposition to proposed mergers. The SCR built Perth General station, which became the focus of several railways at that traffic centre, and a Joint Committee managed the station.

The SCR itself managed to absorb some local railways; the Crieff Junction Railway had opened from Crieff to what later became Gleneagles station in 1856, and it was worked by the SCR and absorbed in 1865.

In 1858 the Dunblane, Doune and Callander Railway was opened in 1858. It achieved considerable significance as the starting point for the Callander and Oban Railway, described below. It was absorbed by the SCR in 1865 immediately before the SCR amalgamated with the Caledonian Railway on 1 August 1865, finally having gained Parliamentary approval to do so.

The Scottish Central Railway was absorbed by the Caledonian Railway in 1865.

==North and east of Perth==
Several railways obtained their acts of Parliament on the same day as the Caledonian, on 31 July 1845. There was a frenzy of railway promotion in that year, and it seemed as if every locality must have its own line. The Scottish Central Railway had been described above; the Scottish Midland Junction Railway (SMJR), the Aberdeen Railway and the Dundee and Perth Railway also got their acts on the same day.

The SMJR built a line from Perth to Forfar; at Perth it used the Scottish Central Railway joint station. The main line ran through the fertile area of Strathmore and the SMJR adopted two existing short lines that were on a suitable alignment. They were the Newtyle and Coupar Angus Railway and the Newtyle and Glammiss Railway. Both were unsuccessful adjuncts to the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, built using stone block sleepers and a track gauge of . The two short lines were modernised and altered to double track using standard gauge. At Forfar the SMJR joined the Arbroath and Forfar Railway, another earlier stone block railway, in this case using the track gauge of . The SMJR opened in 1848.

The Inchture Express was a horse-drawn carriage service operated by the Caledonian Railway Company. Its rails &quot;ran along a hedge-lined route&quot; to Inchture railway station. It later closed and the rails were lifted.

The Aberdeen Railway was to run north from Guthrie, a few miles northwest of Arbroath. Joining the Arbroath and Forfar Railway there, it obtained access to both termini of that line. It was authorised to lease the A&amp;FR. The Aberdeen Railway may have underestimated the cost of upgrading the A&amp;FR&#x27;s stone block track, and it ran out of money building its own main line; its construction was delayed and it encountered political difficulty in Aberdeen itself. It opened in 1850 to Ferryhill, on the southern margin of the city, extending to Guild Street station in 1854. There were branches to Brechin and Montrose.

At this early stage the Caledonian Railway saw itself as the future creator of an extensive network in Scotland, and it set about gaining control of as many other Scottish railways as possible. It did so not by purchasing them, but by leasing them. This had the advantage that no payment was required at first, only a periodical payment much later. The Caledonian negotiated with the SCR, the SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway and believed it had captured them, but the SCR had other ideas. Much later the Caledonian found that the periodical lease payments were unaffordable, and it was rescued by the legal opinion that the lease agreements had been ultra vires.

The Dundee and Perth Railway opened in 1847; it was taken over by the Scottish Central Railway, and its network came to the Caledonian with the SCR when that company was taken over by the Caledonian in 1865.

The Scottish Midland Junction Railway opened in 1848 from Perth to Forfar, giving onward access to Aberdeen. The SMJR and the Aberdeen Railway amalgamated in 1856 to form the Scottish North Eastern Railway in 1856. The SNER did not remain independent for long: it was absorbed by the Caledonian in 1866. At the time of the absorption the SNER and the Great North of Scotland Railway were engaged in building a through line at Aberdeen, with a new Joint station; it opened in 1867.

The Caledonian had now got what it had wanted from the outset: control of an extensive network of lines covering a considerable territorial area. This came at a cost: Parliament became increasingly uncomfortable with monopolies of this kind, and when the North British Railway protested, it was given running powers over much of the Caledonian&#x27;s northern system. There was worse to come: as the North British approached Dundee with the building of the Tay Bridge, which opened in 1878, the NBR sought and was given joint ownership of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway, which became jointly owned in 1881. The NBR had already built an independent line from Arbroath to Kinnaber Junction, north of Montrose, and so, with the opening in 1890 of the Forth Bridge immediately north of Edinburgh, the NBR now had a rival route to Aberdeen. Competition between the companies on the east and west coast routes from London to Aberdeen led in 1895 to what the press called the Race to the North.

Acquisition of the SNER and other lines brought a number of branch lines to communities off the main line. A number of infill lines were added towards the end of the 19th century. The Dundee and Forfar direct line was opened by the Caledonian in 1870 between Broughty Ferry and Forfar, developing commuter travel to Dundee but otherwise only a rural line. The Forfar and Brechin Railway was promoted as a potential alternative main line; it opened in 1895 but remained simply a rural branch.

==Callander and Oban Railway==
The Callander and Oban Railway was an independent company intended to connect the western seas to the railway network, but it had been promised financial support by the Scottish Central Railway (SCR). The Caledonian absorbed the SCR in 1865 and the directors were dismayed at the level of commitment to a difficult construction scheme barely started. Construction took many years, reaching a &quot;Killin&quot; station in 1870 and completing in 1880, and money was always desperately tight.

The line was never profitable although it contributed greatly to the development of the town of Oban. A branch was built to Ballachulish, opened in 1903.

The western part of the line from Crianlarich to Oban is open today, connected to the ex-NBR West Highland Line, but the remainder has closed.

==The Strathearn lines==
The Perth, Almond Valley and Methven Railway opened in 1858 to connect Methven to the SMJR network; it was extended to Crieff when the Crieff &amp; Methven Railway opened in 1866.

Crieff now had two railway connections, using the same station. The upsurge in tourism in Strathearn encouraged many visitors, who used Crieff as a railhead and continued by road. In 1893 the Crieff and Comrie Railway made a short extension into Strathearn, and this encouraged ideas of completing a link right through to the Callander and Oban line. There were wild dreams of Irish cattle imports coming to Perth markets over the route. This became the Lochearnhead, St Fillans and Comrie Railway; due to serious problems raising capital, it took from 1901 to 1905 to open fully. The through traffic never developed and passenger connections at Balquhidder were poor, discouraging through travel.

==Notable accidents==

*On 2 October 1872, an express passenger train was in collision with a freight train that was being shunted at on the main line due to errors by the station master and signalman, compounded by a lack of interlocking and absolute block working. Twelve people were killed.
*On 23 October 1899, an express passenger train was in collision with a cattle train at . One person was killed.
*On 6 April 1906, an express freight train was derailed south of due to the failure of a wheel on the third wagon of the train. The derailed wagons fouled the opposite line; an express passenger train ran into them and was derailed. One person was killed and several were injured.
*On 2 April 1909, a passenger train became divided and was derailed at when the crank axle of the locomotive hauling it failed. A few passengers suffered minor injuries.
*On 16 July 1914, 16-year-old ‘wagon greaser’ James Beck was walking between two railway lines near Shawfield (Glasgow) when he was hit by an oncoming train and as a result, was killed.
*On 22 May 1915, a troop train was in a head-on collision at Quintinshill due to a signalman&#x27;s error. An express passenger train then ran into the wreckage. A fire then broke out which killed 226 people and injured 246 in what remains the deadliest railway accident in the United Kingdom . Two signalmen were later jailed for culpable homicide.

<text>The Highland Railway (HR) was one of the smaller British railways before the Railways Act 1921, operating north of Perth railway station in Scotland and serving the farthest north of Britain. Based in Inverness, the company was formed by merger in 1865, absorbing over 249 miles (401 km) of line. It continued to expand, reaching Wick and Thurso in the north and Kyle of Lochalsh in the west, eventually serving the counties of Caithness, Sutherland, Ross &amp; Cromarty, Inverness, Perth, Nairn, Moray and Banff. Southward it connected with the Caledonian Railway at Stanley Junction, north of Perth, and eastward with the Great North of Scotland Railway at Boat of Garten, Elgin, Keith and Portessie.

During the First World War the British Navy&#x27;s base at Scapa Flow, in the Orkney Islands, was serviced from Scrabster Harbour near Thurso. The Highland Railway provided transport, including a daily &quot;Jellicoe Express&quot; passenger special, which ran between London and Thurso in about 22 hours. In 1923, the company passed on approximately 494 miles (795 km) of line as it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. Although its shorter branches have closed, former Highland Railway lines remain open from Inverness to Wick and Thurso, Kyle of Lochalsh, Keith (as part of the Aberdeen to Inverness Line), as well as the direct main line south to Perth.
== History ==

=== Origins ===
The Highland Railway was formed in 1865 by a merger of three companies centred on Inverness: the Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Junction Railway extending to the east; the Inverness &amp; Ross-shire Railway to the north; and the Inverness &amp; Perth Junction Railway to the south.

==== Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway ====

The first proposals for rail links to Inverness were made in 1845. These were the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) between Inverness and Aberdeen and so link up with the railways to the south; the Perth &amp; Inverness Railway, proposing a direct route over the Grampian Mountains to Perth; and the Aberdeen, Banff &amp; Elgin Railway, with a route that followed the coast to better serve the Banffshire and Morayshire fishing ports. The Aberdeen, Banff &amp; Elgin failed to raise funds and the Perth &amp; Inverness Railway was rejected by Parliament because the railway would be at altitudes that approached and needed steep gradients. The Great North of Scotland Railway Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. ciii) received royal assent on 26 June 1846, authorizing a route needing few major engineering works. Two years later the railway mania bubble had burst and the necessary finances could not be raised. Construction eventually began in November 1852, albeit only to Huntly, and this line was officially opened on 19 September 1854. An extension to Keith, halfway between Aberdeen and Inverness, opened on 11 October 1856.

Meanwhile the Inverness &amp; Nairn Railway had been given permission for a line between Inverness and Nairn, together with a branch to Inverness Harbour, on 24 July 1854. The line opened ceremonially on 5 November 1855 when a train of thirty vehicles, mainly goods wagons fitted with seats, made a return journey. Intermediate stations opened at Culloden (later ), , Fort George (later ) and . Initially three trains a day ran between Inverness and Nairn, horse-drawn coaches providing a link to Keith and thereby Aberdeen via the Great North of Scotland Railway. The Inverness &amp; Nairn planned an extension as far as Elgin; between Elgin and Keith the River Spey needed to be crossed. The GNoSR offered £40,000 towards a bridge and the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway (IAJR) was given authority for a line from Nairn and Keith in July 1856. A temporary station at Dalvey, west of the River Findhorn, opened on 22 December 1857, to close when the line extended to on 25 March 1858. , and the GNoSR, was reached on 18 August 1858. Three services a day ran between Inverness and Aberdeen, Aberdeen being reached in between 5 hours 55 minutes to 6 hours 30 minutes. The Spey Bridge was unfinished when the line opened, so initially passengers walked across the adjacent road bridge as the locomotive was detached and crossed before the carriages were hauled over by ropes. The Inverness and Aberdeen Junction absorbed the Inverness &amp; Nairn in 1861.

The Morayshire Railway had opened a line between and Elgin on 10 August 1852, public services starting the next day. Permission was granted to the Morayshire to run over the IAJR to Orton and to build a branch to Rothes. The IAJR opened the line on 18 August 1858 and the Morayshire started running services on 23 August. Conflict soon arose between the IAJR and Morayshire Railway, and the directors of the Morayshire responded with plans to build their own line between the two stations. The Great North sponsored the new line and offered to provide services after the lines had been physically connected. Permission was granted on 3 July 1860, goods were carried from 30 December 1861 and passengers from 1 January 1862. The Morayshire was operated by the Great North of Scotland from 1866 and was absorbed in 1881.

Between Forres and Elgin two branches opened, the first being from to ; long this operated independently from 18 April 1860 before being taken over by the IAJR in 1862. The IAJR also opened a branch from to on 22 December 1862.

==== Inverness and Ross-shire Railway ====

The Inverness and Ross-shire Railway was given permission on 3 July 1860 to build a railway the from Inverness to Invergordon. After the section to was complete and given the necessary permission by the Board of Trade on 10 June 1862, the line opened to traffic the following day. The terminus at Inverness was not situated to allow through traffic, so additional platforms were built on the west side and the layout arranged as a Y. The Rose Street curve joined the two lines, and most arriving trains would take this curve past the station and then reverse into the platforms, allowing easy interchange and through carriages. The line to Invergordon opened on 25 March 1863, delayed due to conflict over the line crossing the Ferry Road at Findon. The original plans were for a level crossing, but following protests a bridge was built.

Within a month of opening, on 30 June 1862, the Inverness and Ross-shire Railway was absorbed by the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway. Initially there were four services a day, connecting with trains from Keith at Inverness, and averaging 1 hour 40 minutes for the , and one train a day on Sundays, the mail train.

A extension to Bonar Bridge (later ) was authorised as the Ross-shire Extension Act on 11 May 1863. The line opened as far as Meikle Ferry on 1 June 1864 and to Bonar Bridge on 1 October 1864. Initially connections to the ferry were provided from , but these began to serve Bonar Bridge soon after the station had opened, and Meikle Ferry station closed in 1869.

==== Inverness and Perth Junction Railway ====
Although in 1860 Inverness had a rail link to the south, the route via Aberdeen was circuitous and involved a change between two railway stations over apart. Passengers were conveyed between the termini by omnibus, paid for in the through fare and with forty five minutes being allowed for the transfer. The GNoSR refused to hold its trains to connect with trains arriving at Guild Street. The mail train would be held until the Post Office van had arrived and the mail was on board, but the station locked at the advertised departure time to prevent connecting passengers further delaying the train. A more direct long route south to Perth, bypassing Aberdeen, was planned. This left the Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Junction at Forres on a steeply graded line, before heading south to a summit at Dava, then to Grantown and the River Spey to Kingussie, before another climb to a summit at the Pass of Druimuachdar, at the highest in Britain. The line then descended to Birnam, from Perth and linked to Perth by the Perth &amp; Dunkeld Railway since 1856. Although a similar route had been rejected in 1845 because of the high altitudes and speed gradients, there had been sufficient advance in locomotive design to satisfy the fears of the parliamentary committee, and authority was given in 1861. A long girder bridge crossed the River Tay near Dalguise and a viaduct crossed the River Divie near Dunphail. North of Dunkeld was a long tunnel and with through the Pass of Killiecrankie. The line was initially single track with passing loops at stations, the IAJR doubling the track for between Inverness and in 1864.

Work started in 1861, and the 13 miles from Dunkeld to opened on 1 June 1863. To allow access to the new line from both Keith and Inverness a new triangular station was built at Forres south of the old line, which was retained for goods traffic. The line from this new station to opened on 3 August, the complete line opening on 9 September 1863. Initially two through trains a day ran between Perth and Inverness, taking about six hours. These were supplemented by additional mixed slow services from Perth to and from Inverness to . Additional services ran after 1866; only the mail train ran on Sundays.

A branch from to was also authorised, and this opened on 3 July 1865. The Inverness &amp; Perth Junction Railway absorbed the Perth &amp; Dunkeld in 1864.

==== Genesis ====

The Inverness and Aberdeen Junction and the Inverness and Perth Junction Railway were merged on 1 February 1865, and became known as the Highland Railway after the passing of the (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. clxviii) on 29 June 1865. The railway owned of line and operated over the of Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER) line from Stanley Junction to Perth. Apart from this line and that between Inverness and Dalcross, this was all single track railway. Andrew Dougall, who had been founding General Manager of both railways, became its first General Manager. William Barclay had been locomotive supervisor for both constituent railways, resigned in 1865, and the first Highland Railway locomotive supervisor was William Stroudley.

=== Far North Line ===

==== Sutherland Railway ====
The Sutherland Railway received permission in 1865 for a extension of the Highland Railway from Bonar Bridge to Brora. The route followed the Kyle of Sutherland inland for 3 miles, before crossing over to the north shore with the five masonry arches and girder span of Invershin Viaduct. The Highland contributed £15,000, but only of line were built, the railway opening as far as Golspie on 13 April 1868. Either side of the viaduct across the Kyle are Culrain and Invershin stations, apart. The Highland provided two services a day north of , with through carriages to Perth on the mail train.

==== Duke of Sutherland&#x27;s Railway ====
The 3rd Duke of Sutherland planned an extension of the line from Golspie to Helmsdale, passing Dunrobin Castle, his family seat. Work had already started when authority was obtained in 1870, and the section from Dunrobin to about short of Helmsdale was complete that autumn. The Duke purchased a locomotive and some carriages, and the line was opened by Princess Christian on 1 November 1870. Two trains a day ran until 19 June 1871, when the line was connected up with the Sutherland Railway at Golspie and the Highland extended its services to Helmsdale.

==== Sutherland and Caithness Railway ====

A railway linking Thurso and Wick had been proposed in the 1860s and had the necessary authority in 1866, but had failed to raise the necessary funds. The Sutherland and Caithness Railway was authorised to take over the route of the Thurso and Wick Railway, and extend the line south to link up with the Duke of Sutherland&#x27;s Railway at Helmsdale. With the Duke of Sutherland subscribing £60,000 and the Highland Railway £50,000, the railway opened on 28 July 1874. Initially two trains a day covered the from Inverness to Wick in between 7 and hours, by 1885 the fastest trains were taking 6 hours, and in 1914 the &quot;Further North Express&quot; took hours.

==== Dingwall and Skye Railway ====
Only certain routes are practicable in the Highlands due to the terrain, but from Dingwall it was possible to reach Kyle of Lochalsh on the west coast, opposite the Isle of Skye. Permission was granted in 1865, but landowners in Strathpeffer opposed the railway and created difficulties buying the land. In 1868, permission was granted for a different route, to the north of the spa town. The terminus was short to Strome Ferry, because of the cost of building a line around the coast to the Kyle of Lochalsh. The railway opened on 5 August 1870 for goods and passengers were carried from 19 August. Two trains a day were provided, either connecting with trains or providing through carriages at Dingwall. One train a day connected with steamers from Strome Ferry to Portree on Skye, and to Stornoway on Lewis. No Sunday services were provided, possibly because the traffic wasn&#x27;t sufficient, but also it recorded that on a Sunday in 1883 villagers at Strome Ferry, determined to keep the Sabbath, prevented the loading of a special fish goods train until midnight had passed.

==== Steamships ====
The Dingwall and Skye Railway purchased two steamers, &quot;Jura&quot; and &quot;Oscar&quot;, to operate the services to Portree and Stornoway. Initially a daily service was provided to Portree, and a weekly service to Stornoway, but the first winter the frequency of the Portree service was reduced and the Stornoway service suspended. &quot;Oscar&quot; ran aground in November 1870, to be replaced with &quot;Carham&quot; and a new ship, named &quot;Ferret&quot;, was purchased to replace &quot;Jura&quot;. It was found that most of the work could be carried out with &quot;Carham&quot;, and &quot;Ferret&quot; was offered for charter. A three-month lease was agreed and paid for, but the ship went missing. It was discovered later in Melbourne, Australia, when offered for sale under an assumed name that the port authorities could not identify in the records. The company withdrew in favour of MacBrayne&#x27;s running the service in 1880.

==== Merger ====
The Dingwall and Skye Railway was absorbed by the Highland Railway in 1880, and the Sutherland, Duke of Sutherland&#x27;s and Sutherland &amp; Caithness Railways were absorbed in 1884.

=== Expansion ===

==== Branch lines ====
In 1881 the GNoSR applied to Parliament to extend the line from Portsoy along the Moray Firth to Buckie, but this was rejected after the Highland opposed. The following year, both the Great North and Highland railways applied to Parliament for permission, the Great North for a line from Portsoy along the coast through Buckie to Elgin, and the Highland for a branch from Keith to Buckie and Cullen. Authority was granted, but in the case of the Highland Railway only for a line as far as Portessie, with running rights over the Great North coast line between Buckie and Portsoy and the Great North obtaining reciprocal rights over the Highland railway between Elgin and Forres. The Portessie branch opened on 1 August 1884 and the Highland did not exercise its running rights over the GNoSR, thus preventing the Great North running over its lines west of Elgin.

The Dingwall &amp; Skye had needed to avoid Strathpeffer, and their station on the main line was away. The Highland obtained authority for a branch into the spa town. This opened on 3 June 1885 and the original Strathpeffer station was renamed Achterneed. On 10 October 1892 the Burghead branch was extended along the coast to . Fochabers was served by two stations, both inconvenient. The Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Railway had opened a Fochabers station in 1858, but this was from the town. In 1886 the GNoSR opened a station called Fochabers-on-Spey, also about away on their Coast Line. The Highland built a branch from their line to new Fochabers Town station; the line and station opened 1 June 1894.

A branch from Muir of Ord was built to serve rich farmland and Fortrose on the Black Isle. Permission had been granted for the to reach Rosemarkie, and the line to was opened on 1 February 1894, and work did not start on the planned extension. Although it was possible for a ferry to Skye to pick up passengers at Strome Ferry, a port at the original terminus at Kyle of Lochalsh would have been more convenient. However, in 1889 the West Highland Railway was authorised to build a line from Craigendoran to Fort William, which would have given a more direct route south. Permission for the extension to Kyle of Lochalsh was granted in 1893, and after heavy engineering works the extension to opened on 2 November 1897. The West Highland opened a competitive port at in 1901, but the Highland kept the mail contract and the traffic between Skye and mainland Scotland. Fort George station, between Inverness and Nairn, was away from the military post it served. A branch to the village Ardersier was opened on 1 July 1899, and the junction station renamed and the new terminus became station.

==== East to Keith and Aberdeen ====
The Great North and Highland had agreed in 1865 that traffic between the two railways would be exchanged at Keith, but in 1886 the GNoSR had two lines to Elgin that, although longer than the Highland&#x27;s direct line, served more populous areas. The coastal route between Keith and Elgin was long but had easier gradients than the via Craigellachie. The Highland&#x27;s main line south from Inverness was via Forres and the GNoSR felt that the Highland treated the line to Elgin as a branch. In 1883 a shorter route south from Inverness was prompted by an independent company and the bill was defeated in Parliament only after the Highland promised to request authority for a shorter line. The following year, as well as the Highland&#x27;s more direct line from Aviemore, the Great North proposed a branch from its Speyside Section to Inverness. The Highland Railway route was chosen, but the Great North won a concession that goods and passengers that could be exchanged at any junction with through bookings and with services conveniently arranged.
In 1885 the Great North re-timed the 10:10 am Aberdeen service to reach Keith at 11:50 am with through carriages that reached Elgin via Craigellachie at 1 pm. This connected with a Highland service at both Keith and Elgin, until the Highland re-timed the train and broke the connection at Elgin. The Great North applied to the Board of Trade for an order for two connections a day at Elgin. This was refused, but in 1886 the Great North and Highland railways came to an agreement to pool receipts from the stations between Grange and Elgin and refer any disputes to an arbiter. The midday Highland train was re-timed to connect with the Great North at Keith and Elgin, and a service connected at Elgin with an Aberdeen train that had divided en route to travel via the coast and Craigellachie.

However, the Highland Railway cancelled the traffic agreement and withdrew two connecting trains in 1893, complaining that they were not paying. One of the trains was re-instated after an appeal was made to the Railway and Canal Commissioners and a frustrated Great North applied to Parliament in 1895 for running powers to Inverness, but withdrew after it was agreed that the Railway &amp; Canal Commissioners would arbitrate in the matter. With no judgement by 1897, the Great North again prepared to apply again for running powers over the Highland to Inverness, this time agreeing to double track the line, but the commissioners published their finding before the bill was submitted to Parliament. Traffic was to be exchanged at both Elgin and Keith, the services exchanged at Elgin needed to include through carriages from both the Craigellachie and the coast routes, and the timetable had to be approved by the commissioners. The resulting &#x27;Commissioners&#x27; Service&#x27; started in 1897 with eight though services, four via the Highland to Keith taking between and 5 hours, and four with carriages exchanged at Elgin with portions that travelled via Craigellachie and the coast, two of these taking hours. The 3 pm from Inverness to Aberdeen via Keith took 3 hours 5 minutes.

==== South to Perth ====
From 1866 a mixed goods and passenger service left Perth at 1 am, after connecting with the 10 am train from London, and arrived in Inverness at 9 am. A night train service in the return direction started in 1872, leaving Inverness at 7:30 pm to arrive in Perth at 5:05 am. After sleeping carriages were made available from 1878, the train was re-timed to depart at 10 pm and to arrive at 7 am; London could be reached at 9:40 pm. By 1883, there were four services each way between Inverness and Perth, taking between and 7 hours; two years later the mail trains were rescheduled to take 4 hours with five stops. The loadings on these trains were light in winter, but heavy in July and August with through carriages from other railways being attached. In &quot;Express Trains English and Foreign&quot; Foxwell reports a doubled headed train with 37 carriages, including 12 horseboxes, from ten railway companies. This train was banked from Blair Atholl. The only train to run on Sundays was the mail train, except between 1878 and 1891 when the Inverness to Perth night train ran Sunday nights.
Permission for a more direct route to Perth, south via Moy and Carrbridge before joining the existing line at Aviemore, was obtained in 1884. Permission for the route to be changed was given in 1887 and again in 1892. Trains heading south had to climb several miles of 1 in 60 gradient, before crossing the long Nairn Viaduct constructed from 28 arches of red sandstone and the steel viaduct built over the Findhorn. The line opened from the south, Aviemore to Carr Bridge opening in 1892, to Daviot in 1897 and the line was complete to Inverness on 1 November 1898. The direct line was , shorter than via Forres, reducing the journey time by about an hour. Sleeping carriages for Inverness from London arrived at Perth via the East Coast, West Coast and Midland routes. These carriages were busy in the summer, but winter traffic could be met with only one carriage. In 1903 the Highland suggested that the three companies run a carriage two days a week; however the Caledonian protested as it would haul only two days a week, whereas the North British Railway would work the other four. For a while, sleeping cars were withdrawn north of Perth; a few years later the Midland Railway withdrew its winter sleeping carriages and the London terminus alternated between Euston and King&#x27;s Cross.

The line north of the junction at Stanley was single track, resulting in delays, especially after trains had waited for connections at Perth. From 1890, the signalling system using telegraph orders was replaced by electric tablets, later automatic tablet exchange systems were used. The climb out of Inverness was doubled in 1898, and of line widened over the Grampians between 1901 and 1909. Snow could close the line for days during the winter, and snow fences were erected beside the railway. The Highland had three types of snow plough; a small one that was fitted to locomotives, now capable of hauling trains through drifts. If the snow was less than deep, a pilot engine with a larger plough would precede the train. An even larger plough could be used with three or four locomotives coupled together. Dava Moor and the cuttings near Druimuachdar summit were troublesome, although the line over the summit improved after it had been doubled.

==== Invergarry and Fort Augustus ====
The Great Glen is a natural route that runs south west from Inverness to Fort William and is used by the Caledonian Canal, and more recently the A82 road. In 1884, the Glasgow &amp; North Western Railway proposed a line from the North British Railway&#x27;s station at , in Glasgow&#x27;s northern suburbs, to Fort William, and extending this through the Great Glen to Inverness. Backed by the North British Railway, this would have reduced the distance by rail between Glasgow and Inverness from to . The Highland, concerned about competition from a shorter route, argued that there was insufficient traffic travelling south from Inverness for two lines, and the proposal was rejected by Parliament. The Highland opposed again when the West Highland Railway later applied for a line from Glasgow to Fort William and Spean Bridge, but permission was given in 1889 and the line opened in 1894. Lines from Spean Bridge to Inverness were proposed by both the Highland and West Highland Railways in 1893 but after negotiation, both companies agreed to withdraw their bills. In 1895 the West Highland proposed building a line from Fort William to Mallaig, the Highland objecting as it would compete with their line to Strome Ferry and its planned extension to Kyle of Lochalsh on journeys to Skye. Permission was given and the North British and West Highland Railways both agreed not to sponsor any line through the Great Glen for ten years. The Invergarry &amp; Fort Augustus Railway was a local company and despite opposition, received permission in 1896 for a long line along the Great Glen from Spean Bridge to Fort Augustus, from Inverness. Three proposals, from the Highland, West Highland and Invergarry &amp; Fort Augustus Railway, to extend this railway to Inverness were presented to Parliament the following year, and all failed after costly litigation. After costly construction the line was complete in 1901, but with no money left to buy rolling stock, the company offered the line to the North British, who was running services through Spean Bridge station. The company proposed running services at cost, but a request for guarantees was refused and the line offered to the Highland Railway. After fresh battles in Parliament, and both the Highland and North British Railways guaranteeing that they would not seek to extend the line, the Highland Railway was given permission to operate services on the line for a payment of £4,000 a year.

Services started on 22 July 1903. During the summer some services ran beyond Fort Augustus to a pier on Loch Ness to connect with a steamer, but this was withdrawn in 1906. In 1907 the Highland withdrew and the North British took over until services were suspended between 31 October 1911 and 1 August 1913, and the North British bought the line for £27,000 in 1914. The line became part of the London and North Eastern Railway after the grouping. Passenger services were withdrawn on 1 December 1933, after which a coal train ran on Saturdays until the line closed completely on 1 January 1947.

=== 20th century ===
To serve the county town of Dornoch a Light Railway was built from by an independent company and operated by the Highland Railway, services starting on 2 June 1902. Another Light Railway, approved in 1899, ran south from Wick to Lybster, was supported by a Treasury grant of £25,000. This line opened on 1903, worked by the Highland at cost price, and Lybster harbour was improved by the Duke of Portland. Following negotiations, amalgamation of the Highland and the Great North of Scotland Railways was accepted by the Great North shareholders in early 1906, but the Highland board withdrew after opposition from a minority of their shareholders. The Aberdeen and Inverness trains were jointly worked after 1908 and locomotives were no longer exchanged at Keith or Elgin; between 1914 and 1916 the Highland paid the GNoSR to provide locomotives for all of the services through to Inverness. Sunday services were withdrawn in 1920 after the Postmaster General withdrew deliveries of letters on a Sunday.

Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914 and the government took control of the railways under the Regulation of the Forces Act 1871. Day-to-day operations were left in the control of local management, but movements necessary for the war were coordinated by a committee of general managers. The Navy established a base at Scapa Flow, in Orkney, and this was serviced from Scrabster Harbour, from the Highland station at Thurso. A repair base for shipping was built at Invergordon, including housing for 4000 workers. Defence works at Scapa Flow and Invergordon required large amounts of timber at the same time the demand from the south for pit-timber increased; by 1918 the Highland was transporting ten times the amount of timber it had shipped before the war. Coal, which before the war was carried by coastal steamers, now had to be shipped by rail. To cope with the irregular flow of officers and men to and from London a special train was arranged between London and Thurso. This ran between 1917 and 1919, leaving London Euston at 6 pm (3 pm in the winter) to arrive in Thurso  hours later; the return journey left at 11:45 am and took  hours. The train was composed of 14 carriages of corridor stock, policed by a travelling master-at-arms; officers were given sleeping accommodation. The train stopped for 30 minutes at Inverness so a meal could be provided by the station hotel; some days nearly 1,000 meals were provided.

The line between Keith to Highland&#x27;s Buckie station closed in 1915 and only goods traffic used the line from Buckie to Portessie. Locomotive repairs fell behind because of the excessive demands and many of the engine fitters had been called up for war service. Twenty locomotives were loaned from other railways; efforts to get engine fitters failed. 756 of the 3,000 Highland Railway staff served active service and a memorial to 87 that died was placed in Station Square at Inverness. The railways were in a poor state after the war, costs having increased, with higher wages, the introduction of an eight-hour day and the price of coal having risen. A scheme was devised whereby the railways would be grouped into four large companies; this was approved by Parliament as the Railways Act 1921.

=== Grouping and nationalisation ===
On 1 January 1923 the Highland Railway became a part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), passing on of line. Refreshment carriages were introduced on services from summer 1923, but competition from bus services meant services were withdrawn from the Burghead and Fochabers branches in 1931. Sunday services were restored in 1929 with a train in each direction between Perth and Inverness via Forres. Third Class sleeping berths between London and Scotland were available from 1928, although the Glasgow to Inverness remained first class only until 1932. From 1936 it was possible to travel from London to Inverness by day, albeit with changes at Edinburgh and Perth. The railways were again placed under government control on 1 September 1939, and Britain was at war two days later.

Britain&#x27;s railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948 and the former Highland Railway lines were placed under the control of the Scottish Region of British Railways.

The 1955 Modernisation Plan, known formally as the &quot;Modernisation and Re-Equipment of the British Railways&quot;, was published in December 1954, and with the aim of increasing speed and reliability the steam trains were replaced with electric and diesel traction. Diesel locomotives replaced steam locomotives from 1958. Diesel multiple units were used on local services between Perth and Blair Atholl and from 1960 cross-country units were used on an accelerated Aberdeen to Inverness service that allowed hours for four stops. Most of the steam locomotives had been withdrawn by June 1961.
The branches from Muir of Ord to Fortrose closed in 1951 and the Dornoch Light Railway in 1960 as a result of competition from road transport. The former junction station at Stanley closed in 1956. In 1960 twenty stations closed on the line to Wick and Thurso, resulting in significant time savings. The line was diverted on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line in 1954 to allow the level of Loch Luichart to be raised for a hydro-electric project.

In 1963 Dr Beeching published his report &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, which recommended closing the network&#x27;s least used stations and lines. This recommended closing all the former lines except those to Perth and Keith. Local trains were withdrawn between Elgin and Keith in 1964, the Aberfeldy branch and the line between Aviemore and Forres closed in 1965 but the lines to the north of Inverness remain. The goods service at individual stations was also withdrawn after Beeching&#x27;s report.

In the 1969 timetable there were early morning trains between Aberdeen and Inverurie, and five services a day between Aberdeen to Inverness, supplemented by two Aberdeen to Elgin services that by the late 1970s were running through to Inverness. In 1962 the &quot;Elizabethan&quot;&#x27;s six-hour schedule between London and Edinburgh meant a 9:30 am London departure gave a 9:30 pm arrival at Inverness, with 33 minutes allowed for changing trains at Edinburgh, and a through daytime service from Inverness to London via Perth started in 1974 with the &quot;Clansman&quot;, and this was replaced in 1984 by the &quot;Highland Chieftain&quot; with a schedule of about hours.

=== Legacy ===
, the Highland Railway&#x27;s main lines out of Inverness are used by ScotRail services to Perth, Keith, Kyle of Lochalsh, and Wick and Thurso. The line south to Perth is single track, apart from double track for a few miles out of Inverness and between and . There are eleven services a day to Perth that continue onto either Glasgow or Edinburgh. The daily &quot;Highland Chieftain&quot; service from London King&#x27;s Cross still runs, taking about eight hours for the journey and the &quot;Caledonian Sleeper&quot; operates between London Euston to Inverness on six nights a week.

The Aberdeen to Inverness Line currently uses the line to Keith with stations at Nairn, Forres and Elgin. Eleven trains a day run between Aberdeen and Inverness, taking about hours, supplemented by a couple of early morning trains from Elgin to Inverness. There are plans for a regular hourly Aberdeen to Inverness service with additional hourly trains between Inverness and Elgin and a new station at Dalcross, and Network Rail are evaluating what line upgrades are necessary. The Far North Line is served by four trains a day from Inverness to Wick, via Thurso, taking about hours, supplemented by four services to Invergordon, Tain or Ardgay. The Kyle Line is served by four trains a day from Inverness that take about hours.

The Heritage Strathspey Railway operates seasonal services over the former Highland Railway route from to Grantown-on-Spey via the joint Highland and GNoSR Boat of Garten station. The Dava Way is a long-distance path that mostly follows the route of the former Highland railway line between Grantown and Forres.
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 7 February 1884 there was an accident at Kildonan railway station. A special fish train from Wick approached the station when it derailed and ploughed up several hundred yards of track. The fireman, Alexander Campbell of Wick, died and the engine driver, David Mathieson of Wick was badly injured.
*On 29 April 1891 there was a collision at Helmsdale railway station between a down mixed train from Inverness which ran into an engine which had arrived earlier. Major Marindin of the Board of Trade investigated and found that the driver Robert Lindsay deliberately ignored the signals as he would have had difficulty in restarting the train on the rising gradient of 1 in 59.
*On 15 June 1915, a bridge over the Baddengorm Burn at Carrbridge, Inverness-shire collapsed in a storm when débris from another bridge upstream was swept into it. A passenger train ran onto it and was derailed. Five people were killed.

=== Locomotives ===
==== Early designs ====

When the Highland Railway was created in 1865 it acquired the locomotives of its constituent companies, nearly all of which had been built under the supervision of William Barclay. In these early years locomotives were painted a dark green with numbers on the buffer beam.

The Inverness &amp; Nairn opened in 1855 with two 2-2-2 locomotives with four wheeled tenders, built by Hawthorns of Leith, with a weather board to protect the engine men. Two more were bought by the Inverness &amp; Aberdeen Junction in 1857 and another two were built in 1862, with cabs, by Hawthorns for the Inverness &amp; Ross-shire Railway. These early locomotives had all been scrapped by 1901. Between 1862 and 1864 another eighteen were delivered, slightly larger and with six-wheel tenders; the last sixteen built by Neilson &amp; Co. The majority of these were converted into 2-4-0s between 1869 and 1892 and one, No. 35, lasted until 1923.

Seven goods locomotives, 2-4-0 with four-wheeled tenders, had been built in 1858–59 by Hawthorns, and these were followed in 1862 by two more, slightly larger and with cabs. Two batches of ten 2-4-0 goods locomotives were built in 1863–64 by Sharp, Stewart &amp; Co. These were slightly larger than the previous locomotives; the later ten of them had a longer wheelbase than the previous ten. Three locomotives survived until 1923. The Highland also took over the Findhorn Railway&#x27;s small 0-4-0 tank engine that had been built by Neilson and the 0-4-0 tank engine that had been bought for the Hopeman branch from Hawthorns.

Barclay resigned in 1865, the year in which Highland Railway was formed, and William Stroudley became the first locomotive supervisor of the new company. The Inverness &amp; Nairn had built a locomotive works at Lochgorm in 1855, just outside Inverness station, and that became the site of the Highland&#x27;s works. Later, carriage shops were built alongside. Stroudley designed a 0-6-0 saddle tank and three were built at these works between 1869 and 1874. In 1869 he left to join the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway, where more of these locomotives were built, and the class became known as the Terriers. Stroundley painted passenger locomotives yellow with crimson framing and goods locomotives a dark green, and number plates were introduced.

==== Jones ====

David Jones had worked at Lochgorm since 1855, where he had moved at the age of 21 after serving his apprenticeship with the London &amp; North Western Railway. He became locomotive supervisor in 1870. His first design was a 4-4-0 passenger locomotive, with the double chimney that became standard on his Highland Railway locomotives. Ten were built by Dübs &amp; Co. in 1874, and between 1878 and 1888 another seven were built by the Highland at Lochgorm. The tenders had six wheels, but considered small. All were still in service in 1907, but in 1923 only five had survived.

Two 2-4-0 passenger locomotives were built at Lochgram in 1877, followed by three 2-4-0 tank engines in 1878/9 for shunting and branch line duties. The tank engines were rapidly converted to 4-4-0s after problems with the leading axle. After two of the earlier 2-4-0 locomotives had been successfully converted into 4-4-0 for the Dingwall &amp; Skye Railway, nine of the 4-4-0 &#x27;Skye Bogie&#x27; Class were built between 1882 and 1901. Eight 4-4-0 tender locomotives for main line services were built in 1886 by Clyde Locomotive Co., and a small 0-4-4 saddletank was built at Lochgorm for the Strathpeffer branch in 1890. The &#x27;Strath&#x27; Class followed, twelve 4-4-0 locomotives built by Neilson in 1892 for the main-line, to an enlarged form of Jones&#x27; standard design. In 1892, Dübs &amp; Co. sold the Highland two 4-4-0 tank engines that had been built for the Uruguay Eastern Railway but not delivered. These were followed by three more in the following year, and these locomotives were used on branch lines.

In 1894 Jones introduced his 4-6-0 goods locomotives, the first with this wheel arrangement on British railways. Fifteen locomotives were built by Sharp, Steward &amp; Co., and ran with six-wheeled tenders. One of these, No. 103, is a static exhibit at the Riverside Museum in Glasgow. Fifteen large 4-4-0s, the &#x27;Loch&#x27; Class, arrived from Dübs &amp; Co. in 1896, and these had identical tenders to the goods locomotives.

The Duke of Sutherland purchased a small 2-4-0 tank locomotive, named &quot;Dunrobin&quot;, and after the Highland began providing services this was reserved for the Duke&#x27;s private carriage. After the Duke died in 1892 his son, the 4th Duke of Sutherland, purchased a Jones designed 0-4-4 tank from Sharp, Stewart &amp; Co. that was provided with accommodation in the cab for the Duke&#x27;s guests. Jones changed the livery of the goods locomotives to black lined with red and white. After 1885 all locomotives were painted a pea green with a darker border, lined with red and white. Number plates were retained.

==== Drummond ====
Jones retired in 1896, after an accident testing a locomotive. He was replaced by Peter Drummond, who had worked at LB&amp;SCR, North British and Caledonian Railways before joining the Highland. The first locomotives designed by Drummond were the &#x27;Small Bens&#x27; that closely followed locomotive design on the NBR and CR. A total of 20 were built by Dübs &amp; Co., Highland Railway at Lochgorm and North British Loco Co. in 1898–1901 and 1906, these were smaller than the Loch Class, and they normally worked on the line north to Wick and Thurso and east to Keith. Drummond designed a 0-6-0 goods locomotive, and twelve were built between 1900 and 1907 by Dübs &amp; Co. and the North British Loco Co. These had boilers and cylinders interchangeable with the &#x27;Small Bens&#x27;.

The &#x27;Castle&#x27; Class were a powerful 4-6-0 passenger locomotive with large tenders that ran on two bogies. From 1900 a total of twelve were built, the last two in 1910/11, and they worked between Perth and Inverness. One was fitted in 1912 with a Phoenix superheater, but this was later removed. Between 1903 and 1906 seven tank engines were built at Lochgorm, three 0-6-0s for shunting and four 0-4-4s for branch services. Six &#x27;Big Bens&#x27; followed, similar to the &#x27;Small Bens&#x27; but with slighter larger boilers. In 1909 and 1911 twelve 0-6-4 tank engines were built, designed for banking.

Drummond changed the locomotive livery soon after joining the company, removing the red lining, edging instead in white, and adding &#x27;HR&#x27; on the tenders or tanks and front buffer beams. These initials became &#x27;Highland Railway&#x27; in full on the Castle class. After 1903, the locomotives were painted a darker green with no lining and labeled, &#x27;The Highland Railway&#x27; on the tenders or tanks. Drummond moved to the Glasgow &amp; South Western Railway in 1912.

==== Later designs ====

Fredrick Smith followed as locomotive superintendent; he had been works manager for the Highland since 1903. Four more Castle Class locomotives were built by the North British in 1913, with modifications to the design of the smokebox and chimney. Smith designed the &#x27;River&#x27; Class, large 4-6-0 tender locomotives, for working on the Perth main line, and six were ordered from Hawthorn, Leslie &amp; Co. Two arrived in 1915, but as soon as they arrived the Chief Engineer condemned them as being too heavy for the Highland track. Smith resigned and the locomotives were sold to the Caledonian Railway.

Smith was replaced by Christopher Cumming, who had worked for the North British Railway. The demands of World War I meant a shortage of traction, and six locomotives were built to older designs, three &#x27;Loch&#x27; Class and three &#x27;Castle&#x27; Class, which arrived in 1917. Cumming designed a 4-4-0 tender locomotive, with Robinson superheaters, and two of these also arrived in 1917 to work the Far North Line. Eight 4-6-0 goods locomotives to a Cummings design, also with Robinson superheaters, arrived in 1918–19. The &#x27;Clan&#x27; Class was designed for the Perth to Inverness route, 4-6-0 tender locomotives with superheaters and six wheel tenders and eight were built by Hawthorn, Leslie &amp; Co, four in 1919 and four in 1921. Cummings resigned due to ill health early in 1922 and David Chalmers Urie was appointed successor. The Highland Railway ceased to exist on 31 December 1922, passing 173 locomotives to the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway; twenty-three of these were withdrawn from traffic before being renumbered by the new company.

====Locomotive depots====
The principal locomotive depots on the Highland Railway were at Inverness, Perth, Blair Atholl, Forres and Aviemore, which in July 1919 had allocations of 59, 36, 12, 10 and 9 locomotives respectively. The remaining 35 locomotives were spread out among fifteen depots, most of which had only one or two locomotives each: Aberfeldy (1), Burghead (2), Dingwall (4), Dornoch (1), Fochabers (1), Fort George (none), Fortrose (1), Helmsdale (4), Keith (2), Kingussie (2), Kyle of Lochalsh (6), Lybster (2), Tain (2), Thurso (1) and Wick (6). In January 1935, by which time Fochabers and Kingussie had closed, the LMS reorganised its motive power depot structure, and codes were allocated to the depots as follows:

By September 1935, several depots (such as Blair Atholl and Kyle of Lochalsh) had their allocations reduced, but Fort George now had one locomotive allocated. The HR depot at Perth, latterly known as Perth North, closed in 1938 with its locomotives being transferred to Perth South, the former Caledonian depot.

=== Carriages ===
The first carriages used by the Inverness &amp; Nairn Railway were of the short four-wheeled type and had accommodation for first and third class. A mail van made in 1858 for the Inverness to Keith route survived until 1903; this was long, and fitted with Newall&#x27;s chain brake. Luggage was carried on the roof, behind a railing, where there was also a seat for the guard, and dogs were placed in a boot. Later carriages did not have the seat for the guard and space for luggage on the roof. Longer carriages were ordered for the line to Wick, long, and these seated 50 passengers in third class. Six-wheeled carriages were introduced in the late 1870s, the first class seating sixteen passenger with access to toilets and the third class seating fifty passengers; these were still lit by oil lamps. Second class accommodation was available after the direct line to Perth opened, but this was not popular as it offering little extra comfort over third class, and was abolished in 1893. A six-wheeled carriage built at Lochgram in 1909 has been preserved by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society.

The first eight-wheeled carriages were three first class sleeping carriages. These accommodated nine passengers, in two single berth compartments and two larger compartments, one for ladies and one for gentlemen. Between 1885 and 1907 the Pullman Car Company provided two specially designed carriages, each sleeping sixteen. A travelling attendant was provided by Pullman and the supplementary fare for a berth was 5s. Carriages from other railways was conveyed on the main line from Perth.

After Drummond became locomotive supervisor at Lochgorm in 1896 the older carriages were replaced by bogie stock that had access to a toilet from both third and first class accommodation, gas lighting and steam heating. Passenger carriages had previously been green with yellow lining, but Drummond painted the upper sides white. The livery reverted to green in 1903, although the sleeping carriages that which replaced the Pullmans and main-line excursion trains were built in varnished teak. Drummond&#x27;s designs continued to be built until grouping, later carriages included vestibules and electric lighting.

<text>USS &quot;Quincy&quot; (CA-71) was a heavy cruiser of the &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class of the United States Navy. She was the third ship to carry the name.

==Construction==
The third &quot;Quincy&quot; was authorized on 17 June 1940, and laid down at the Fore River Shipyard of the Bethlehem Steel Company, Quincy, Massachusetts, as &quot;St. Paul&quot; on 9 October 1941. Renamed &quot;Quincy&quot; on 16 October 1942, to perpetuate that name, after the destruction of the second at the Battle of Savo Island on 9 August 1942. She was launched on 23 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Catherine Adams-Morgan, wife of Henry S. Morgan, daughter of Charles Francis Adams, and sponsor of the previous &quot;Quincy&quot;. She was commissioned at the U.S. Naval Drydock, South Boston, Massachusetts, on 15 December 1943, with Captain Elliot M. Senn in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===
After a shakedown cruise in the Gulf of Paria, between Trinidad and Venezuela, the new heavy cruiser was assigned, 27 March 1944, to Task Force 22 and trained in Casco Bay, Maine, until she steamed to Belfast, Northern Ireland, with TG 27.10, arriving 14 May and reporting to Commander, 12th Fleet for duty. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force, accompanied by Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk, inspected the ship&#x27;s company in Belfast Lough 15 May 1944.

USS &quot;Quincy&quot; sailed out of Belfast Lough, 20 May, for the Clyde and anchored off Greenock, Scotland, to begin special training in shore bombardment. She then returned to Belfast Lough, and began final preparations for the invasion of Europe. Her float plane artillery observer pilots were temporarily assigned to VOS-7 flying Spitfires from RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus). At 0537, 6 June 1944, she engaged shore batteries from her station on the right flank of Utah Beach, Baie de la Seine.

During the period 6 through 17 June, in conjunction with shore fire control parties and aircraft spotters, &quot;Quincy&quot; conducted highly accurate pinpoint firing against enemy mobile batteries and concentrations of tanks, trucks, and troops. She also neutralized and destroyed heavy, long range enemy batteries, supported minesweepers operating under enemy fire, engaged enemy batteries that were firing on the crews of the ships USS &quot;Corry&quot; (DD-463) and &quot;Glennon&quot; (DD-620) during their efforts to abandon their ships after they had struck mines and participated in the reduction of the town of Quinéville on 12 June.

&quot;Quincy&quot; steamed to Portland, England, 21 June, and joined TF 129. She departed Portland, 24 June, for Cherbourg, France. The bombardment of the batteries surrounding the city commenced in conjunction with the Army&#x27;s assault at 1207. Nineteen of the twenty-one primary targets assigned the task force were successfully neutralized or destroyed thus enabling Army troops to occupy the city on 26 June.

The heavy cruiser sailed for Mers-el Kebir, North Africa, on 4 July, arriving there 10 July. She proceeded to Palermo, Sicily, 16 July, arriving two days later. &quot;Quincy&quot;, based at Palermo through 26 July, conducted shore bombardment practice at Camarota in the Gulf of Policastro. She then steamed to Malta via the Straits of Messina. Between 27 July and 13 August, the cruiser participated in training exercises at Malta and Camarota, Italy.

On the afternoon of 13 August, in company with four British cruisers, one French cruiser, and four American destroyers, &quot;Quincy&quot; departed Malta for the landings on the southern coast of France, arriving Baie de Cavalaire 15 August. For three days the group provided fire support on the left flank of the U.S. 7th Army. &quot;Quincy&quot; transferred 19 August to TG 86.4, and until the 24th, engaged the heavy batteries at Toulon, St. Mandrier, and Cape Sicie. She steamed westward the afternoon of 24 August to support minesweepers clearing the channel to Port de Bouc in the Marseilles area.

USS &quot;Quincy&quot; was detached from European duty on 1 September, and steamed for Boston, arriving one week later. She remained at Boston for the installation of new equipment through 31 October, when she got underway for training in Casco Bay. After fitting out at Boston for a Presidential cruise, &quot;Quincy&quot; steamed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, 16 November.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his party embarked on &quot;Quincy&quot; on 23 January 1945, at Newport News, Virginia, for passage to Malta, arriving 2 February. After receiving calls by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and other dignitaries, President Roosevelt departed &quot;Quincy&quot; and continued on to the Crimea by air to attend the Yalta Conference.

====The &quot;Quincy&quot; Agreement====
USS &quot;Quincy&quot; departed Malta 6 February 1945, and arrived at the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal two days later, after calling at Ismalia, Egypt. The President and his party returned to &quot;Quincy&quot; on 12 February, following the Yalta Conference with Soviet leader Josef Stalin and Churchill, and the next day received King Farouk of Egypt and Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia.

From 14 February, President Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, known in the West as Ibn Saud, met aboard &quot;Quincy.&quot; During the meeting, President Roosevelt tried to persuade Ibn Saud to give support for Jewish immigration to Palestine, and hoped that Ibn Saud might be able to offer constructive advice on the Palestine issue. There, Roosevelt and Saud concluded a secret agreement in which the U.S. would provide Saudi Arabia military security – military assistance, training and a military base at Dhahran in Saudi Arabia – in exchange for secure access to supplies of oil.

After a call at Alexandria, and a final meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, &quot;Quincy&quot; steamed for Algiers, arriving on 18 February. The President&#x27;s senior aide, Maj. Gen. Edwin &quot;Pa&quot; Watson, who had been ailing, died aboard ship on 20 February. Following a presidential conference with the American ambassadors to Great Britain, France and Italy, the cruiser steamed for the United States, arriving at Newport News on 27 February.

====Remainder of wartime career====

USS &quot;Quincy&quot; sailed out of Hampton Roads 5 March 1945, arriving Pearl Harbor 20 March. After training in the Pearl Harbor area, she steamed for Ulithi via Eniwetok, joining the 5th Fleet there 11 April. Two days later, she departed Ulithi and joined Rear Admiral Wiltse&#x27;s Cruiser Division 10, in Vice Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force. From 16 April, &quot;Quincy&quot; supported the carriers in their strikes on Okinawa, Amami Gunto, and Minami Daito Shima. She returned to Ulithi with units of the task force 30 April.

In company with units of TF 58, &quot;Quincy&quot; departed Ulithi 9 May, for the area east of Kyushu, Japan, arriving 12 May for carrier strikes against Amami Gunto and Kyushu. Before dawn on 14 May, the cruiser splashed a Japanese plane. Her own aircraft strafed targets in Omonawa on Tokune Shima 19 May. &quot;Quincy&quot; continued to support carrier aircraft strikes against Okinawa, Tokuno Shima, Kikai Jima, Amami Gunto, and Asumi Gunto until the force returned to base 13 June. En route, &quot;Quincy&quot; safely rode out the severe typhoon of 5 June.

During the period of replenishment and upkeep at Leyte in the Philippines, Rear Admiral Wiltse, ComCruDiv 10 transferred to &quot;Quincy&quot;. The cruiser departed Leyte 1 July with Task Force 38 to begin a period of strikes at Japan&#x27;s home islands which lasted until the termination of hostilities on V-J Day. She supported carriers in strikes in the Tokyo Plains area, Honshu, Hokkaido, and Shikoku.

&quot;Quincy&quot; joined the Support Force, 23 August, and four days later, helped occupy Sagami Wan, Japan, and entered Tokyo Bay 1 September.

Rear Admiral Wiltse transferred his flag 17 September to &quot;Vicksburg&quot; (CL-86), and 20 September, &quot;Quincy&quot; joined the 5th Fleet as a unit of the Eastern Japan Force, TF 53, basing in Tokyo Bay.

===Korean War===
&quot;Quincy&quot; was decommissioned on 19 October 1946, in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. She was assigned to the Bremerton Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet until 31 January 1952, when she recommissioned to serve in the 7th Fleet in support of United Nations Forces in Korea. Following fitting out and readiness training, she served in the screen of the Fast Carrier Task groups ranging off the coastline of Korea from 25 July 1953 to 1 December 1953. She again decommissioned 2 July 1954, at Bremerton.

===Fate===
&quot;Quincy&quot; sat in the reserve fleet at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard until she was stricken on 1 October 1973. She was the only one of her class to retain her Bofors 40 mm gun mounts instead of receiving the newer 3/50 mounts. Of the &quot;Baltimore class&quot; she had the second shortest active career (&quot;Fall River&quot; was in service just years), and was in active service for only years. She was sold to American Ship Dismantling Co., Portland Oregon on 1 September 1974 for $1,156,667.66.

<text>The Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&amp;SWR) was a railway company in Scotland. It served a triangular area of south-west Scotland between Glasgow, Stranraer and Carlisle. It was formed on 28 October 1850 by the merger of two earlier railways, the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway and the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway. Already established in Ayrshire, it consolidated its position there and extended southwards, eventually reaching Stranraer. Its main business was mineral traffic, especially coal, and passengers, but its more southerly territory was very thinly populated and local traffic, passenger and goods, was limited, while operationally parts of its network were difficult.

It later formed an alliance with the English Midland Railway and ran express passenger trains from Glasgow to London with that company, in competition with the Caledonian Railway and its English partner, the London and North Western Railway, who had an easier route. In 1923 the G&amp;SWR formed a constituent of the London Midland and Scottish Railway group.

Much of the network remains active at the present day; Glasgow commuting particularly has developed, and parts of the network have been electrified. Many of the earlier mineral workings, and branches constructed to serve them, have ceased, and many local passenger stations in rural areas have closed.

In 1921 the G&amp;SWR had of line (calculated as single track extent plus sidings) and the company’s capital was about £19 million.

==History==
===Before the G&amp;SWR===
In the early 1830s, there were already several mineral railways operating in Scotland; local in extent, they were mostly built to serve coal mines and other mineral activity. The successful operation of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway as an inter-city line, and then the Grand Junction Railway reaching northwards, caused railway promoters in the west of Scotland to consider that one day, there might be a through railway line to London.

The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&amp;AR) was authorised in 1838, and opened its line to Ayr in 1840. It was a locomotive railway, and in due time it opened its branch line from Dalry to Kilmarnock, with the intention of extending to Carlisle to meet up with whatever railway might reach that city from the south. The had anticipated constructing its authorised line and then the extension, but by 1846 there was a frenzy of competing schemes that threatened to destroy the company&#x27;s core business. Few of these were realistic, but the itself felt obliged to promote numerous branches, many of them tactical, in order to keep competing schemes out. This period of railway promotion was followed by a slump, when money was difficult to come by, and these factors prevented the from bringing its Carlisle extension into reality.

Enthusiasm for a connection to English railways continued, however, and was intensified by the promotion of other schemes to link central Scotland and England. Interests friendly to the formed the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway (GD&amp;CR) to extend from the southern extremity of the to Carlisle; their route became known as the &quot;Nithsdale Route&quot;. Opposing promoters put forward a so-called &quot;central line&quot; via Carstairs and Beattock, that had the advantage of a shorter mileage, and the capacity to serve Edinburgh directly, but the disadvantage of much heavier gradients and running through a less populous area. This route became known as &quot;the Annandale Route&quot;.

The was authorised by an act of Parliament, the Glasgow, Dumfries, and Carlisle Railway Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. ccclxxii), but the rival Caledonian Railway (CR) had already had authorisation for building its line on the Annandale route; the &#x27;s financial position led it to abandon its intention of building an independent line to Carlisle, and it altered its plan so as to join the at Gretna Junction, relying on negotiating running powers for its trains to reach Carlisle.
The and the formed the definite intention of merging; at first the demanded terms that were excessive, particularly as their own financial situation was weak: they were funding construction of their line with money loaned by the . However more realistic expectations emerged later, and by an act of Parliament of 1846 and the (10 &amp; 11 Vict. c. clxxxiii) it was determined that the two companies would merge when the had completed construction of its line. The extended as far as Horsecleugh (between Cumnock and New Cumnock) and the reached an end-on junction there, completing the through line on 28 October 1850.

===The G&amp;SWR formed===
Accordingly on 28 October 1850 the G&amp;SWR was formed. Although this was described as a merger, the reality was that the penniless GD&amp;CR was dissolved, its operation was taken over by the GPK&amp;AR, and the latter company changed its name to the G&amp;SWR. The GPK&amp;AR had been working the GD&amp;CR&#x27;s line for it since it (partially) opened.

The new company had lines:
* from Bridge Street in Glasgow to Ayr; the Ayr station was north of the river, at Newton-on-Ayr), and the section between Bridge Street and Paisley was owned and operated jointly with the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway; and 
* from Dalry Junction to Gretna Junction via Kilmarnock and Dumfries; and
* a number of lines in mineral districts, including the former Kilmarnock and Troon Railway, now upgraded to contemporary technical standards.

The trains on the Dumfries line now ran through to Carlisle, an arrangement having been made with the Caledonian Railway to permit this. However the CR did not encourage the G&amp;SWR and only on 1 March 1851 was a booking clerk given accommodation at Carlisle Citadel passenger station. This was granted on an undertaking that the G&amp;SWR would never interfere with the business of the CR or the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, and tolls were charged for use of the line from Gretna, and for bulk goods passing through Carlisle, whether transshipped or not. The CR ensured that all traffic between south of Carlisle and Glasgow or Edinburgh was routed over its own line.

The accounts for the first half-year, produced in March 1851, showed gross income for the six months to be £87,186 and a 2¼% dividend was declared. The Company owned 72 engines, 171 passenger coaches, and 2,416 non-passenger vehicles. Good enough as the results were, the long main line to Gretna was not producing much, due to the dominance of competing route of the Caledonian Railway, and business in general declined following the first half-year. A pooling agreement was finalised in 1853 which mitigated some of the worst toll charges, but routing of goods traffic via the CR was made obligatory in many situations. The agreement included a comprehensive limitation on encroachment by either railway into the other&#x27;s territory.

===Expansion by alliance===
In the years immediately following the formation of the G&amp;SWR, the shortage of capital meant that no definite steps were taken for further expansion. Local initiatives were encouraged, however, with the G&amp;SWR providing some funding and in most cases working the line when it was completed.

The Ayr and Dalmellington Railway Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. cxlviii) was passed on 4 August 1853. At this time the G&amp;SWR Ayr station was north of the River Ayr, and the A&amp;DR was to run from Falkland Junction, a short distance north of the station, and round the east side of the town. The new line had an Ayr passenger station (a temporary structure at first), but it was less convenient than the old terminus; until January 1860 the old G&amp;SWR terminus station continued to be used by some trains. There were important ironworks owned by the Houldsworth family, and ironstone and coal deposits, in the lands near Dalmellington. The independent A&amp;DR company was worked by the G&amp;SWR and later absorbed on 1 August 1858.

On 10 July 1854 the Ayr and Maybole Junction Railway was authorised to reach Maybole by a junction from the Ayr and Dalmellington; the junction was to be called Maybole Junction, but was named &quot;Dalrymple Junction&quot; when the line opened to goods traffic on 15 May 1856. Passenger opening was delayed until 2 August 1856 because of the Board of Trade Inspecting Officer&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the works at first. This line too was worked by the G&amp;SWR.

There were discussions of a further extension railway to reach Girvan and develop the harbour there, possibly as a ferry port for Ireland: a Maybole and Girvan Railway was formed in 1855; it got its authorising act of Parliament, the Maybole and Girvan Railway Act 1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. xcix), on 14 July 1856. All of these local initiatives received the promise of cash support from the G&amp;SWR. The Maybole and Girvan line opened on 24 May 1860; the old Maybole station, east of Redbrae, was unsuitable for an onward route and was by-passed, the new passenger station being at Culzean Road.

The Ardrossan Railway had long been allied to the G&amp;SWR and by the Ardrossan Railway Transfer Act 1854 (17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. clxxxii) of 24 July 1854 it was vested in the G&amp;SWR, effective on 1 August 1854. The line ran between Ardrossan Harbour and Kilwinning, with mineral branches extending further east.

===Reaching towards the north of Ireland===
The wide space of countryside west of Dumfries and south of Girvan still lacked any rail connection. In 1856 a provisional Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway (CD&amp;DR) was gaining momentum. It was independently sponsored, although it was seen as a possible first step in opening up the entire region; it was authorised on 21 July 1856. This prompted the G&amp;SWR to relocate the Dumfries station to a point north of St Mary&#x27;s street; the former &quot;temporary&quot; station was relegated to goods status. The new station opened on 13 September 1859: it was described as &quot;equal if not superior in lightness and beauty to any in Great Britain&quot;. The line opened on 21 July 1856.

For many years schemes had been put forward to reach Portpatrick. There was a small harbour there and ferry crossings to Donaghadee provided the shortest route to reach the north of Ireland. Mail, cattle, and soldiers had been conveyed that way, but reaching Portpatrick with a railway across difficult and sparsely populated land had been a challenge. Encouraged by the authorisation, at the end of 1856 promoters resolved to build a &quot;British and Irish Grand Junction Railway&quot;, 62 miles (100 km) from Castle Douglas. Government assurances were given about the use of the sea route for mail and improvement of the tiny harbour at Portpatrick, and suddenly rival railways including the English Great Northern Railway were hastening to put up money for a share. With a capital of £460,000, the line looked well supported and got its act of Parliament, the Portpatrick Railway Act 1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. cxlix), on 17 August 1857, retitled the Portpatrick Railway.

The construction, through difficult terrain, went ahead, and as completion became near, the Portpatrick Railway planned the arrangements for the working of its line. The G&amp;SWR were working the and offered to work the Portpatrick line for 72% of gross receipts. The G&amp;SWR had recently announced that it worked its own railway for less than 38%, and the Portpatrick line decided the proposed charge was too much; on 28 March 1860 they decided that &quot;the board should retain the working of the line under their own management&quot;. The G&amp;SWR had been certain that its terms for working the line would have to be accepted; it had promised a further £40,000 towards the capital cost of the Portpatrick Railway, and on a pretext it now declined to make that payment, further alienating the Portpatrick Railway. The line opened, stoutly independent, on 12 March 1861 as far as Stranraer.

The Government had implied a promise to improve the tiny harbour at Portpatrick and was now delaying; the Portpatrick Railway delayed too, but finally completed the line from Stranraer to Portpatrick on 28 August 1862. Although some use was made of the route, the anticipated major sea crossing never materialised, and in time Stranraer became the more important port.

===The Paisley and Renfrew line===
Before the existence of the G&amp;SWR, its predecessor, the GPK&amp;AR had acquired the Paisley and Renfrew Railway, a horse-operated railway with track on stone blocks, and the GS&amp;WR acquired this line. By 1866 the primitive technology had become an embarrassment and pressure from the Burgh of Renfrew caused the G&amp;SWR to upgrade the line to locomotive haulage, converting it to standard gauge, and connecting it to the main (joint) line at Greenlaw, east of Paisley, and facing Glasgow. The work was completed by September 1867 and through passenger trains between Glasgow and Renfrew were instituted.

===Crossing the Clyde, and a central Glasgow station===
As traffic increased, dependency on the Bridge Street station as the G&amp;SWR Glasgow station became ever more strained, and a nominally independent central terminus was proposed; this would involve constructive the first railway bridge over this part of the Clyde—there had previously been no connection across the river in Glasgow. The G&amp;SWR and the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway were partners, and invited the Caledonian Railway to join in, but the CR declined.

The &quot;City of Glasgow Union Railway&quot; obtained Parliamentary authorisation on 29 July 1864; the capital was £900,000 with the G&amp;SWR and the E&amp;GR taking one-third of the shares each. (The following year the two existing companies agree to take all the stock themselves.) The line would run from a junction with the Paisley joint line at West Street to Sighthill on the E&amp;GR, with a new passenger station at St Enoch, a large goods station in land vacated by the University of Glasgow and a connection at West Street to the General Terminus goods branch on the bank of the Clyde.

Construction was slow and costs overran heavily; on 12 December 1870 the first trains ran from Shields Road to a temporary central passenger terminus at Dunlop Street. On 1 June 1871 the line was extended to Bellgrove, joining the North British Railway (NBR) there, and forming the north-south connecting link, which was heavily used for transfer goods trains.

It was not until 1 May 1876 that St Enoch station opened and through trains to London ran from there. The station was universally regarded as magnificent, and in 1879 the accompanying St Enoch Hotel, the largest in Scotland, opened too. By now the NBR enthusiasm for a general central passenger station had waned, and the northwards exit from St Enoch station was only used by local G&amp;SWR trains to Springburn. On 29 June 1883 the station and the immediate approach lines were transferred from the CGUR to the G&amp;SWR.

This was followed by partition of the CGUR; the section south and west of College Junction (near High Street, NBR) went to the G&amp;SWR, and the section north and east of Bellgrove went to the NBR. These changes were enacted on 29 June 1883.
In the 1890s it became obvious that expansion of St Enoch was essential, and on 18 August 1898 the (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. clix) for the extension of St Enoch station was passed. A second arch roof and six further platforms were built; they were brought into use progressively from 1901. The extension was completed in 1904, at a cost of £2,500,000.

===A direct line to Kilmarnock===
The GPK&amp;AR had declined to give Kilmarnock a direct route; it opened its line via Dalry in 1843. In 1848 the &quot;Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway&quot; (GB&amp;NDR) opened from a South Side terminus in Glasgow. The line was friendly to the Caledonian Railway. In 1865 both the Caledonian Railway and the G&amp;SWR obtained acts of Parliament giving them authority to build lines from Glasgow to Kilmarnock. Shareholders of both companies objected to the wasteful duplication, and in 1869 an act of Parliament was obtained for the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway, owned jointly by both companies, running from Neilston on the GB&amp;NDR. It opened in 1873, with a branch from Lugton to Beith. A connection into the St Enoch line was opened shortly afterwards.

===Other new lines proposed, and existing branches absorbed===
As well as supporting the City Union line, in 1864 the proposed a large number of branch lines, most of them tactical in respect of competition with the Caledonian Railway. This caused considerable disquiet among shareholders—the same was true within the Caledonian company—and some moderation of the proposals took place. As part of the rapprochement, the was granted permanent powers to run between Gretna and Carlisle, for £5,000 a year.
Under the (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. ccxcviii), four railways were absorbed, effective from 1 August; they were the Bridge of Weir Railway (from Elderslie, opened in 1864), the Maybole and Girvan Railway (described above; it had never made money and had run out of cash to finish the buildings and ancillary works on the line); the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway (CD&amp;DR); and the Kirkcudbright Railway. The and the Kirkcudbright Railway were now operated as the &quot;Kirkcudbright branch&quot; as a single unit from Dumfries. The Caledonian Railway was granted running powers between Dumfries and Castle Douglas for trains it ran between Lockerbie and Stranraer.

===Reaching Greenock===
From the outset, Greenock had been served by the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway, allied to the Caledonian Railway. The port developed and carried increasing volumes of goods, and passenger traffic for the Clyde ferries grew considerably. The G&amp;SWR wished to secure a share of this valuable traffic, and the &quot;Bridge of Weir Railway&quot; had been a move in that direction. The friendly Greenock and Ayrshire Railway (G&amp;AR) was heavily supported (£300,000 out of £350,000 share capital) by the G&amp;SWR, and opened its line from Bridge of Weir to its Albert Harbour station at Greenock, in 1869. This gave a quayside transfer to steamers at Greenock, and a price war with the established CR line broke out, eventually resolved with a traffic sharing agreement: the G&amp;SWR received 42.68% of receipts.

In 1872 the G&amp;AR was absorbed by the G&amp;SWR. The Greenock Harbour Trustees further developed Albert Harbour, constructing &quot;Princes Pier&quot; with extensive berthing facilities for steamers, and the G&amp;SWR renamed their own station Princes Pier in 1875.

Further extension to the harbour facilities took place at the eastern side of Greenock, at Garvel. The G&amp;SWR built a connecting line eastwards from Lynedoch, opening on 5 August 1886. G&amp;SWR trains had to reverse twice to reach the harbour on a steep incline. The branch cost £262,467.

===The Annbank lines===

In 1870 and the following years, a network of lines was opened connecting Ayr with mineral-bearing districts in east Ayrshire. The first line was from Ayr to Mauchline through Annbank, and this was followed by a long loop from Annbank to Cronberry on the Muirkirk line, and a connection to Holehouse Junction on the Dalmellington route. Although the Mauchline connection facilitated some passenger journeys, mineral traffic was more important than passenger operation on these lines.

===Extending to Largs===
Ardrossan had long been reached, but the G&amp;SWR wished to extend up the coast to Largs. It experienced resistance at first, the Largs Branch opened in stages between 1878 and 1885, with stations at West Kilbride, Fairlie and Largs.

A Fairlie Pier station was opened: the station roof was built using materials recovered from the temporary Dunlop Street station. Bitter and destructive competition for the ferry traffic to island locations developed.

===Portpatrick again—or Stranraer===
The G&amp;SWR had reached Girvan in 1860 with the help of allied local companies. Continuing from Girvan to Portpatrick, for the crossing to the north of Ireland was still an aspiration, but this section was the most difficult, and sparsely populated terrain. After some false starts, friendly promoters put forward a Girvan and Portpatrick Junction Railway (G&amp;PJR) obtained an authorising act of Parliament on 5 July 1865 to close the gap. Raising money, and carrying out the construction was much more difficult than expected. The railway was to reach Stranraer by joining the Portpatrick Railway at Challoch Junction, continuing over that line for 10 miles (16 km). However the Portpatrick line was being worked by the Caledonian Railway (CR), and the CR was hostile to the G&amp;PJR, which it saw was an ally of the G&amp;SWR.

It took until 5 October 1877 to inaugurate a full passenger service over the line. In the intervening period the supposed advantages of Portpatrick as the ferry port for the north of Ireland had dissipated, and Stranraer was now considered the better port. The G&amp;PJR was financially exhausted and weak, operating a long main line with little local business. The financial situation worsened and the company was taken over by the &quot;Ayrshire and Wigtownshire Railway Company&quot; (A&amp;WR) on 1 August 1887. The new ownership appears to have been a speculative move, but the A&amp;WR was no more solvent than its predecessor. In 1892 the G&amp;SWR purchased the company for £270,000 (on 20 June). It introduced corridor coaching stock was on the boat trains in 1899.

The Portpatrick Railway (PR) had its established line from Dumfries to Stranraer, also a long line through difficult terrain with little intermediate business, but achieving significantly better financial results. The arrangement with the CR for that company to work the line expired in 1885 and the PR considered who might take up the work. Both the CR and the G&amp;SWR were candidates, and two English railways, the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway were interested in extending their influence to Stranraer to capture Irish business.

The Wigtownshire Railway was in effect a branch of the PR, running south from Newton Stewart to connect good quality farming land around Wigtown and the sea ports of Garlieston and Wigtown. Their line was being worked by an independent contractor, Thomas Wheatley and his son.

After considerable negotiation, the decision emerged not to form a further working arrangement for the PR, but instead to merge the PR and the Wigtownshire Railway. The combined network formed the Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Joint Railway, purchased by a consortium of the interested larger companies, the G&amp;SWR, the CR, the MR and the LNWR. The arrangement was ratified on 6 August 1885; the sale value was £491,980. The line was worked by the G&amp;SWR and the CR in tandem.

===Paisley Canal, and the Dalry and North Johnstone line===

As traffic developed, especially the mix of heavy mineral traffic and passenger trains, line capacity became increasingly a problem. This was particularly the case on the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Line where the traffic of the rival Caledonian Railway had to be dealt with. In 1881 the G&amp;SWR submitted a parliamentary bill to drain the defunct Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal and build a railway on it. The bill passed as the (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. cxlix), and the G&amp;SWR started work on what became the Paisley Canal Line. The new line left the former City of Glasgow Union Line at Shields Junction, where it joined the Joint Line, and ran via the southern part of Paisley to Elderslie, where it rejoined the Ayr main line. At this time Paisley was enjoying very considerable industrial growth and the new line was able to serve the relevant areas.

Following the route of a contour canal involved many meandering curves, the worst of which were eased by the use of earthworks. The line opened fully on 1 July 1885, and some through passenger trains used the line as well as local and mineral trains. Capitalising on access to industry in Paisley, a spur off the Canal Line to Potterhill was opened in 1886.

In 1894–5, new carriage sidings were constructed at Bellahouston on the Canal Line, while new engine sheds at Corkerhill were constructed, to relieve pressure on the city centre accommodation.

Industry was expanding too in Johnstone, on the north side of the town in areas not served by the main line. As well as mineral extractive industries, there were extensive textile mills along the Black Cart Water, and a short branch line from Cart Junction to Johnstone North was opened in 1896.

The traffic congestion problem was also experienced on the main line between Elderslie and Dalry (where the Kilmarnock line diverged) and the decision was taken to duplicate this section of the route by a new line on the north of the lochs in the Garnock Valley. The scheme upgraded the Johnstone North line, and ran from its terminus (upgraded and relocated) to Brownhill Junction, north of Dalry, by way of Lochwinnoch. This was the Dalry and North Johnstone Line, which opened in 1905. The capacity relief was continued at Dalry by quadrupling the track from Brownhill Junction, and the junction itself was a flying junction, the first in Scotland.

Much more traffic took the diverging route at Elderslie towards Cart Junction—all of the new line traffic, as well as the fast Greenock boat trains—and the opportunity was taken to provide a burrowing junction at Elderslie for this route: when the Ayr main line was built, it crossed the canal by a bridge. The canal was long defunct, and a new line was built passing under the bridge and running to Cart Junction, eliminating the conflicting move. This opened in 1906.

===Darvel===
In 1896 the Newmilns branch was extended to Darvel. When the Caledonian Railway reached the town from the east in 1905, a non-encroachment agreement was activated and a few miles of line from Darvel to the Lanarkshire county boundary was transferred from the CR to the G&amp;SWR. There was an end-on connection at the county line.

The volume of mineral traffic heading for Troon and Ayr caused congestion in passing through Kilmarnock station, and a by-pass line on the south side of the town opened in 1902. These developments are described in the article Cross-country lines of the Glasgow and South Western Railway.

===Linking Paisley and Barrhead===
Observing the success of the Paisley Canal and Potterhill lines in serving industry, both the CR and the G&amp;SWR considered lines in the area between Paisley and Barrhead. In 1902 the G&amp;SWR opened the Barrhead Branch from Potterhill to a new Barrhead Central station, with spurs to the GB&amp;KJR route. For a time a circular passenger service was operated from St Enoch via Paisley Canal, Potterhill and Barrhead Central. Usage proved disappointing, and it reverted to a reduced conventional service in 1907, and Barrhead Central closed to passengers in 1917.

===Three local lines after 1900===
The small industrial town of Catrine had long aspired to a railway connection. Possibly responding to a petition, the G&amp;SWR built a short branch from Brackenhill Junction, south of Mauchline. The Catrine branch opened on 1 September 1903, with a train service operated by a railmotor.

In 1905 the Cairn Valley Light Railway opened, connecting Moniaive with the G&amp;SWR main line just north of Dumfries. It adopted a proprietary signalling system based on Sykes lock and block system. Passenger usage was poor and was hit hard by bus competition, and the line closed to passengers in 1943.

On 17 May 1906 the Maidens and Dunure Light Railway opened. Intended to open up remote coastal settlements between Ayr and Girvan it was promoted with the construction of the luxurious Turnberry Hotel. Through trains from Glasgow were run, and in both World Wars military use was made of the line. Local passenger services were discontinued in 1930, but the link at the Girvan end to Turnberry survived for a short period; at the Ayr end a holiday camp was in use, receiving holidaymakers by train to Heads of Ayr until 1968.

==Operations==
===Brakes===
In the earliest days, railways did not have continuous brakes (in which brakes on all or most vehicles in a train could be controlled by the driver). Over the course of time, accidents created pressure for their provision on passenger trains, but the system to be adopted was controversial.

At first the company adopted Smith&#x27;s simple vacuum brake, but although the equipment was simple, it had the defect that it was inoperable in the event of a train becoming divided, or if the engine apparatus failed. The company decided to change systems: at the end of 1878 the Board of Trade were informed that the G&amp;SWR had six engines operating Smith&#x27;s brake, and 22 engines operating the Westinghouse brake. The Westinghouse system was much more complicated, but it was an automatic brake.

In this period there was considerable disparity in the systems used on the railways of the country, and compatibility between locomotive and the vehicles of another company, for example on through trains, was a serious issue. The company began to see its future as an ally of the Midland Railway, a large English system using the automatic vacuum brake, and in 1884 decided to convert to that system. There was a lengthy transition period during which compatibility with other companies&#x27; rolling stock was a problem.

By the end of 1900 the company had 210 engines fitted with continuous brake equipment, and 97% of passenger mileage was under such conditions. 2,021,266 train miles were run with the automatic vacuum brake, and 69,160 with Westinghouse.

===Slip coach===
Between 1888 and 1901 the G&amp;SWR operated a slip coach service. The slip coach section was slipped at Irvine off the 4.15 pm St Enoch to Ayr, which ran non-stop from Paisley to Prestwick. The slip section was attached to an Ardrossan to Ayr stopping train, with which it followed the main train. Six-wheel brake vans with end windows were built for the service.

==Signalling==
Swan, writing for the G&amp;SWRA, described early concentration of signalling and primitive interlocking at Dumfries:

In 1859 the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway formed a junction at Dumfries, and at the request of the G&amp;SWR built a brick &quot;lighthouse&quot; or octagonal signalbox at Albany Junction. It opened with two wooden masts built into the castellated telegraph hut, the tallest for running up and down a flag to signify if the main line north to St Enoch was clear and the second one slightly shorter to signal the trains for the Castle Douglas branch.

With the opening of the Lockerbie branch into Dumfries in 1863 the pointsman&#x27;s tower was removed from the junction beyond Albany Place and was re-erected on the summit of the slope at the deep cutting north of Dumfries station. The Castle Douglas and Lockerbie railways formed junctions with the G&amp;SWR line in the cutting opposite the pointsman&#x27;s tower.

The Kirkcudbright Advertizer (sic) further reported: The points at the sidings and junctions will be worked from the top of this bank by means of rods and levers. Three semaphore signal posts have been erected at the tower; the central post, which is higher than the others, is for the G&amp;SWR line; that on the eastern side, for the Lockerbie line; and the one on the western side, for the Castle Douglas line. The semaphores for each line will be connected with the levers which work the points, and consequently when the pointsman shifts the points the semaphore is made by the same movement to show the proper signal ... In the night the signals will be by lamp lighted with wax lights.

==Shipping==
Serving many piers and harbours on the Firth of Clyde it was natural that the G&amp;SWR developed shipping services to the islands and other piers. This traffic increased considerably in the 1870s and excursion traffic also became significant.

==Closures==
In the 1960s consideration was given to rationalising the railway facilities in Glasgow, and it was decided to concentrate the south-facing passenger services on Glasgow Central station, closing St Enoch. The closure took place in 1966, and for some time the trainshed was used principally as a car park; the roof was demolished in 1975. The site was redeveloped as the St Enoch Centre, which was opened in May 1989.
The Greenock line was shortened to operate only between Elderslie and Kilmacolm in 1966. In 1971 the Princes Pier stub was connected to the Wemyss Bay line at Cartsburn Junction in order to serve the Clyde Port Authority container terminal.

In June 1965 the Port Road between Dumfries and Challoch Junction was closed; Stranraer boat trains were diverted via Mauchline. In 1966 local services were withdrawn from the Dalry to Kilmarnock line; the route closed completely in October 1973 after completion of the West Coast Main Line electrification.

The Paisley Canal Line was closed in January 1983, and the original Paisley Canal station, on the east side of Causeyside Street, was converted into a restaurant. In the 1980s and 1990s the course of the line beyond Paisley was made into a footpath and cycle path. This links Lady Octavia Park in Greenock, through upper Port Glasgow, Kilmacolm and past Quarrier&#x27;s Village to Paisley. It is part of the Sustrans National Cycle Route linking Edinburgh and Gourock.

==The G&amp;SWR network today==
The main line of the G&amp;SWR, from Glasgow to Carlisle via Kilmarnock and Dumfries continues to operate at the present day. The line from Glasgow to Stranraer via Ayr also continues in use, together with the branch from Kilwinning to Largs. After a period of closure the Paisley Canal line reopened, operating only between Shields Junction and Paisley Canal. Passenger services are supported by the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport.

<text>John Christopher Reilly (born May 24, 1965) is an American actor. He is known as a character actor taking leading and supporting roles in independent drama films and studio comedies. He gained exposure through his supporting roles in Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; (1990), Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s films &quot;Hard Eight&quot; (1996), &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997) and &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999), and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004). Reilly was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the corresponding Golden Globe Award for his role in the musical film &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002). Reilly&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;The River Wild&quot; (1994), &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002).

He then went on to play the title character in &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot; (2007), and Dale Doback, one of the two step brothers, in &quot;Step Brothers&quot; (2008). Meanwhile, Reilly began co-starring as Dr. Steve Brule in the comedic television series &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; (2007–2010), which led to the spin-off series &quot;Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule&quot; (2010–2016).

For his role in the Broadway revival in Sam Shepard&#x27;s play &quot;True West&quot; (2000) he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.

== Early life and education ==
Reilly was born in Chicago, Illinois, the fifth of six children. His father was of Irish and Scottish descent, and his mother was of Lithuanian ancestry. His father ran an industrial linen supply company. Reilly has described himself as being mischievous during his childhood, highlighting an event when he was 12 in which he and his friends stole 500 boxes of Sugar Corn Pops from a freight train. Reilly grew up in the Chicago Lawn neighborhood.

Reilly was raised Catholic and attended Brother Rice High School. He is an alumnus of The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago.

== Career ==
===1988–1995: Career beginnings===
Reilly made his film debut in the Brian De Palma war film &quot;Casualties of War&quot; as PFC Herbert Hatcher in 1989. Although his role was written as a small one, De Palma liked Reilly&#x27;s performance so much that the role was significantly expanded. He played Buck, Tom Cruise&#x27;s character&#x27;s NASCAR crew member in Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; in June 1990. That September, he played an Irish hoodlum named Stevie McGuire in the crime film &quot;State of Grace&quot;, which starred Sean Penn; Reilly had previously appeared as a monk in the comedy &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; (1989), which also starred Penn. In 1992&#x27;s &quot;Hoffa&quot;, Reilly played Jimmy Hoffa&#x27;s (Jack Nicholson) associate who testifies against him at Hoffa&#x27;s trial. Reilly appeared in a supporting role in &quot;What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; (1993), playing one of the titular character&#x27;s (played by Johnny Depp) friends. His next role was in &quot;The River Wild&quot; (1994), in which Reilly appeared alongside Kevin Bacon as a pair of criminals who terrorise a family during a rafting trip. In 1995, Reilly appeared in the psychological thriller &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; as a police constable and in the drama &quot;Georgia&quot; as a drug-addicted drummer in the band Jennifer Jason Leigh&#x27;s character joins.

===1996–2003: Critical acclaim ===
In Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s directorial debut film &quot;Hard Eight&quot; (1996), Reilly played a near homeless man in Reno, Nevada, who is taken under the wing of a senior gambler (Philip Baker Hall). Reilly collaborated with Anderson on other films, playing a pornographic actor in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997); a deeply religious police officer in &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999); and a cameo in the music video for Fiona Apple&#x27;s single &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. Terrence Malick&#x27;s ensemble war film, &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998) featured Reilly in a supporting role that was written as a larger one, but much of his scenes were deleted along with many other cast members. In 1999, Reilly starred in the independent film &quot;The Settlement&quot; alongside William Fichtner, which &quot;Variety&quot; writer Robert Koehler dismissed as a &quot;write-off&quot; despite praising his performance. That same year, Reilly played one of the newspaper managing editors in the romantic comedy film &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;. In Sam Raimi&#x27;s sports drama &quot;For Love of the Game&quot;, released the same year, Reilly played fictional baseball catcher Gus Sinski.

The box office hit &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; was his only release of 2000 and featured Reilly as a veteran crew member on the &quot;Andrea Gail&quot; fishing vessel which was caught in the 1991 Perfect Storm. In the Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming directed comedy &quot;The Anniversary Party&quot; (2001), he played director Mac Forsyth. In 2002, Reilly played a stoner husband in a lackluster marriage to Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s character, who cheats on him with a younger man played by Jake Gyllenhaal, in Miguel Arteta&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;The Good Girl&quot;. Later that year, Reilly appeared in three of the year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Picture nominees – &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; and &quot;The Hours&quot;. In &quot;Chicago&quot;, he played Amos Hart, Roxanne&#x27;s (Renée Zellweger) trusting husband and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, as well as the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. Zellweger remarked that &quot;John is so often the best thing about the movies he&#x27;s in&quot; and critic Roger Ebert praised the &quot;pathetic sincere naivete&quot; that Reilly brought to the role. Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; featured Reilly as corrupt 19th-century constable &quot;Happy Jack&quot; Mulraney, while Stephen Daldry&#x27;s drama &quot;The Hours&quot; saw him play the husband to Julianne Moore&#x27;s character. Reilly made a brief appearance in the comedy &quot;Anger Management&quot; (2003) as a monk.

===2004–2011: Transition to comedy===

Reilly appeared in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2004 Howard Hughes biopic, &quot;The Aviator&quot;, as Noah Dietrich, Howard Hughes&#x27;s (Leonardo DiCaprio) trusted business partner. Of the role Reilly said, &quot;Noah was almost a father figure to Hughes ... Howard would have a scheme, and it was Noah who had to say, &#x27;We don&#x27;t have the money.&#x27; He was one of his few friends.&quot; He played the lead role in the crime film &quot;Criminal&quot; (2004), with Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Based on the Argentine film &quot;Nine Queens&quot; (2000), Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that &quot;John C. Reilly may be one of our finer character actors, but his portrayal of Richard Gaddis, a gimlet-eyed con man, in &quot;Criminal&quot; allows too many vestiges of the duped schlub of a husband he played in &quot;Chicago&quot; to leak into his performance.&quot; Reilly reportedly quit the 2005 Lars von Trier film &quot;Manderlay&quot; to protest the on-set killing of a donkey. He played the lead in one of Miranda July&#x27;s short films, &quot;Are You the Favorite Person of Anybody?&quot; (2005). He was in the Jennifer Connelly-led horror film &quot;Dark Water&quot; (2005) as the manager of a mysterious hotel. Reilly co-starred in Adam McKay&#x27;s comedy about NASCAR drivers entitled &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; in August 2006 as Cal Naughton Jr., the best friend and teammate of the title character, played by Will Ferrell. The film was successful, grossing $163 million worldwide. He appeared in Robert Altman&#x27;s last film &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; that same year, in addition to making an uncredited cameo appearance in &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot; as a Sasquatch.

Reilly frequently appeared on the sketch comedy program &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; from 2007 to 2010 as inept doctor and television presenter Dr. Steve Brule. The role led to the spin-off series &quot;Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule&quot;, which aired from 2010 to 2016 and was written and produced by Reilly. In 2007, Reilly starred as the title character in parody bio-pic &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot;, singing various songs, parodying Johnny Cash, Ray Charles and others. He received two Golden Globe nominations, Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Best Original Song for the film&#x27;s title song &quot;Walk Hard&quot;. The next year, Reilly reunited with Ferrell to star in &quot;Step Brothers&quot;, playing middle-aged step brothers forced to live together. Also that year, he was among the many notable actors to perform in the online political musical, &quot;Proposition 8 – The Musical&quot;, voiced himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Any Given Sundance&quot;, and co-starred alongside Seann William Scott in &quot;The Promotion&quot;. In 2009, he played vampire Larten Crepsley in the film &quot;Cirque du Freak: The Vampire&#x27;s Assistant&quot; and voiced &quot;5&quot; in &quot;9&quot;. Reilly starred in the 2010 film &quot;Cyrus&quot; as a divorcé beginning a new relationship. Reilly received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and an Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead nomination for his critically acclaimed performance.

In early 2011, Reilly collaborated with director Miguel Arteta for a second time with the comedy &quot;Cedar Rapids&quot;, starring Ed Helms. &quot;New York Daily News&quot; critic Elizabeth Weizxman considered Reilly a stand out in the film and he received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male nomination. Reilly co-starred alongside Ezra Miller and Oscar-winner Tilda Swinton in the British-American drama &quot;We Need to Talk About Kevin&quot;, based on the novel by Lionel Shriver. His character in the film was Franklin, the father of the troubled Kevin; his performance was described as being &quot;heartbreakingly sweet&quot; by &quot;Slate&quot; critic Dana Stevens. Next, he co-starred in the comedy-drama &quot;Terri&quot; alongside Jacob Wysocki, playing a school principal who takes an interest in a teenage misfit. His last release of 2011 was Roman Polanski&#x27;s black comedy-drama &quot;Carnage&quot;, which takes place mostly in a single apartment. It also starred Oscar-winners Jodie Foster as his wife, and Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz as another married couple who engage in a conflict after their children get into a fight. Reilly was approached to appear in a production of the play it was based on, &quot;God of Carnage&quot;, but he couldn&#x27;t fit it into his schedule and remarked &quot;I think I&#x27;ve spent enough time in that apartment&quot;.

===2012–present: Blockbuster films===
Reilly voiced the title character in the 2012 animated film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, which follows an arcade game villain who is determined to prove himself as the hero. Reilly made contributions to the film&#x27;s script. The film was positively received, with &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Betsy Sharkey saying, &quot;The movie&#x27;s subversive sensibility and old-school/new-school feel are a total kick.&quot; &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; grossed over $471 million and a sequel titled &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; was released in November 2018. Also that year, Reilly appeared in &quot;Tim and Eric&#x27;s Billion Dollar Movie&quot; as the dim-witted Taquito and made an uncredited cameo appearance in the comedy &quot;The Dictator&quot;, starring Sacha Baron Cohen. He had a cameo in the 2013 comedy sequel &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot;, playing the ghost of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson in the film&#x27;s fight scene.

In 2014, Reilly narrated the nature documentary &quot;Bears&quot;. He played Nova Corps corpsman Rhomann Dey in the Marvel Studios film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, released in August 2014. Reilly began co-starring in the animated television series &quot;Stone Quackers&quot; on FXX in January 2015. In addition to voicing the inept police officer Barry, Reilly also executive produced the series. 2015 saw him appear in five films: the drama &quot;Entertainment&quot;; Yorgos Lanthimos&#x27; comedy-drama &quot;The Lobster&quot; as Robert, a man with a lisp who is given 45 days to find a romantic partner or otherwise be turned into an animal; the fantasy horror &quot;Tale of Tales&quot;, in which he played a king who tries to conceive a child with his queen–played by Salma Hayek–through an unconventional method, and the English dub of the Studio Ghibli animated film &quot;When Marnie Was There&quot;. Reilly also starred in and co-wrote the television special &quot;Bagboy&quot;, reprising his role as Dr. Steve Brule in a fictional television pilot for a sitcom created by Brule. It aired on February 21, 2015, with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; writer Melissa Locker saying &quot;If you get it, the show is knockout hilarious, but truthfully, it is not for everyone and Reilly is O.K. with that.&quot;

Reilly voiced a sheep in the ensemble cast of the animated musical comedy &quot;Sing&quot;, which was released in December 2016. Reilly appeared in the 2017 monster film reboot &quot;&quot;, as Hank Marlow, a World War II lieutenant who has spent 28 years stranded on the titular island. The actor, who described his character as &quot;essentially a love-letter to Chicago&quot;, was singled out for praise for his performance out of what is generally considered to be an underwhelming ensemble cast. Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz noted that Reilly &quot;steals the film instantly and never gives it back&quot; in playing the &quot;wisecracking castaway&quot;, and Owen Gleiberman praised his performance for being &quot;terrifically dry and sly&quot; in what could have been a cliché character.

Reilly co-starred with Steve Coogan in the 2018 biopic &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot; about the comic double act Laurel and Hardy, with Reilly portraying Oliver Hardy and Coogan Stan Laurel. Also that year, he played hitman Eli Sisters in &quot;The Sisters Brothers&quot;, based on the Patrick deWitt Western novel, with Joaquin Phoenix co-starring as his brother Charlie, Jacques Audiard directing, and Reilly as a producer. Reilly himself optioned the rights in 2011, and production took place in the summer of 2017. In 2018, Reilly played Dr. Watson in a comedic adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories, &quot;Holmes &amp; Watson&quot;; Will Ferrell played Holmes. In the same year, Reilly reprised his role as Wreck-It Ralph in &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;, and again in 2023 for Disney&#x27;s centenary short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;.

He made an uncredited cameo appearance as &quot;Munsters&quot; star Fred Gwynne in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; (2021).

In 2002, he played the role of Amos Hart, Roxie Hart&#x27;s naïve husband, in the musical film &quot;Chicago&quot;. In 2006, he performed two songs on &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys&quot;: &quot;Fathom the Bowl&quot; and &quot;My Son John&quot;.

The second single features Ray Price&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There If You Ever Want&quot; as well as the country classic &quot;I&#x27;m Making Plans&quot;, performed with Becky Stark. He also appeared as &quot;future Mike D&quot; in the Beastie Boys&#x27; video &quot;Make Some Noise&quot;. In 2012, his current band, John Reilly &amp; Friends, was slated to perform in the Railroad Revival Tour, alongside Willie Nelson &amp; Family, Band of Horses and Jamey Johnson. However, the event was cancelled.

In 2014, Reilly appeared on the music video for Mr. Oizo&#x27;s song &quot;HAM&quot; in which he played Father. Directed by Eric Wareheim, &quot;HAM&quot; is an excerpt from the television comedy &quot;Rubberhead&quot;, which displays sketches from various comedians. In February 2015, John Reilly &amp; Friends performed on NPR Music&#x27;s Tiny Desk Concert series. In 2017, Reilly appeared in Lil Dicky&#x27;s music video for &quot;Pillow Talking&quot;.

From October to November 2002, Reilly starred as the title character in the musical &quot;Marty&quot;, a musical adaptation of the Paddy Chayefsky-penned film &quot;Marty&quot; (1955). In 2005, he appeared as Stanley Kowalski in Edward Hall&#x27;s production of the Tennessee Williams play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Reilly stated in 2010 that he would be very determined to play the lead role of Nathan Detroit if a revival of the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; were to occur.

In March 2012, he was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black&#x27;s play, &quot;8&quot;—a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California&#x27;s Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage—as David Blankenhorn. The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a non-profit organization funding the plaintiffs&#x27; legal team and sponsoring the play.

<doc id="564148" wikidata="Q811002" url="?curid=564148" title="Battle Programmer Shirase">
<text>is an anime television series aired in 2003 and produced by AIC.

The original series spans 5 story arcs across 15 episodes of 12 minutes each.

==Plot summary==
The story of BPS revolves around a &quot;freelance artist&quot; named Akira Shirase. He is a very talented, yet mysterious computer programmer. Because of his incredible abilities, he is contacted by several individuals (all of them are very similar persons named Akizuki Kaoru) to do all sorts of strange computer-related hacking/security jobs. 

Akira is a very quiet guy who lives alone in a small apartment near his niece&#x27;s house. At first, the episodes revolved around some freelance jobs that highlighted his abilities - however, later on in the series, characters came back and offered help or plot twists. The school that Shirase had gone to had been hinted throughout the series, and it finally made an appearance in the last episode, when some of the characters began to show their hidden relationships to the others. However, the series was not continued.

==Characters==
:
: He is the main character of the story. Akira is a very talented computer connoisseur and is known in the hacking world as Battle Programmer Shirase (which is typically shortened to BPS). A genius in computer hacking and security who can do anything on any computer, or phone.
:
: Misao is Akira&#x27;s great-niece. She is a very shy girl who loves to spend her time with Akira, whom she often refers to as &#x27;. She cares for him deeply and it is very common to see her cooking for him or worrying about him. Sometimes, Misao says &#x27;, which does not have an actual meaning (this may be a &quot;cute&quot; form of speech the creators added for her to please fans of cute anime girls). Misao looks very young for a 6th grader. &lt;br&gt; Misao Amano has made a cameo appearance in the final OVA of (&quot;Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure&quot;) and is a main character in the series (&quot;Magical Girl Pretty Sammy&quot;) in which her alter ego is Pixy Misa.
:
: Yoriko, nickname &quot;Yon&quot;, is a child prodigy who works for the United States Navy. Her rank is Lieutenant Commander. She first meets BPS (Akira) when he is seen walking home after waiting in front of a book store. He explains that the book store clerk only opens when he wants to. She had been following Misao and asked if she could go to her house. She seems to have the same knowledge of computers as Akira and in one episode asks him to join her in the National Guard as her partner. She also asks him to go to America with her, and seems to have strong feelings for Akira as well.
:
: Sae is Misao&#x27;s teacher. In an earlier episode she had tried to get Misao together with a boy from grade class. She is later seen drinking in an alley where she meets Akira, whom she has not seen since high school. She was being forced to have a marriage interview, and since she did not want to go she ended up getting drunk in the alley.

==Music==
There are two theme songs used in the series. The opening theme (OP) is called &quot;Suddenly&quot; by Naomi Amagata. The closing theme (ED) is &quot;Pure Enough&quot; by Yuki Matsuura.

==Thanking the viewers==
The final episode of the show made the unusual step of explicitly apologizing for ending the series, not only to the local Japanese viewers, but also those in the fansub community: It was addressed to &quot;those who enjoy the show on TV, and to those outside the broadcast area who took special measures to watch the show on their PC monitors, and to everyone who watched it subtitled overseas without permission.&quot;

It was one of two aircraft to be named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the other being the Vickers Wellington.

The Wellesley was developed during the early 1930s in response to Specification G.4/31. The biplane Vickers Type 253 was effectively an early incarnation of the aircraft, sharing its radical geodesic airframe and many other features. The Type 253 was determined to be the best submission received by the Air Ministry, thus an order for 150 production aircraft was issued. As a private venture, Vickers had also developed the monoplane &quot;Type 256&quot;; following flight testing of this aircraft, the order placed for the Type 253 was converted for the Type 256 instead.

The vast majority of the Wellesley&#x27;s production run were supplied to the Royal Air Force (RAF), a total of six squadrons under RAF Bomber Command operated the type at its peak. A high-profile demonstration of the aircraft&#x27;s capabilities was conducted during early November 1938 via a flight of three Wellesleys that flew non-stop for two days from Ismailia, Egypt to Darwin, Australia, a distance of , setting a world distance record in the process. While the type was considered to be obsolete by the start of the Second World War and thus unsuited to the European air war, the Wellesley was operated overseas in the desert theatres of East Africa, Egypt and the Middle East. The final Wellesley-equipped unit, 47 Squadron, ended its use of the type as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft, during September 1942.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The Wellesley&#x27;s origins stretch back to the early 1930s, during which time Vicker&#x27;s management were making great efforts to secure more business in the fixed-wing aircraft sector following the decision to discontinue airship production. Several of its designs around this period, often made in response to various specifications issued by the Air Ministry, revolved around a conventional biplane configuration, albeit larger than most contemporaries and being fitted with more powerful engines to match. While some of these proposals never went beyond the drawing board, they often harnessed the work of Barnes Wallis to save weight without compromising on strength by using light alloy structures.

During 1931, the Ministry released Specification G.4/31, which called for a general purpose aircraft that was capable of carrying out level bombing, army co-operation, dive bombing, reconnaissance, casualty evacuation and torpedo bombing. Vickers quickly took an interest in the requirement and gave its design team the task of producing its response. The team devised three separate conceptual aircraft, two being monoplanes with alternative engines fitted, and the third being a biplane design, known as the Vickers Type 253. Following the submission of these three design outlines to Air Ministry in November 1931, it accepted the Type 253, and issued an initial development contract to Vickers during April 1932.

Even as work proceeded on the construction of the Type 253 prototypes, Vicker&#x27;s design office continued to independently work on a monoplane submission to fulfil the specification. This aircraft incorporated a geodesic airframe, which had been derived from Wallis&#x27; earlier work for the airship R100. According to aviation author C. F. Andrews, this design choice was a radical shift from established practices of the era, which had been virtually unchanged since the First World War. Wallis pursued this as it enabled substantial weight savings to be made via unheard of strength-to-weight ratios. The Type 253 also incorporated some of this structural design, but not to the full extent of the in-development monoplane.

Following their delivery, the Type 253 prototypes were subject to competitive testing of their fulfilment of the specification&#x27;s various criteria against a range of competing aircraft, including the Fairey G.4/31, Westland PV-7, Handley Page HP.47, Armstrong Whitworth A.W.19, Blackburn B-7, Hawker P.V.4 and the Parnall G.4/31. From this, it was recognised that the Type 253 was the best submission, leading to Vickers receiving an order for 150 aircraft.

===Type 246===
The private venture monoplane, which received the internal designation &quot;Vickers Type 246&quot; continued to make progress. On 19 June 1935, it performed its maiden flight from Brooklands, piloted by Vickers&#x27; Chief Test Pilot J &quot;Mutt&quot; Summers, and was promptly offered to the Royal Air Force (RAF). This aircraft possessed superior performance, but did not attempt to meet the multi-role requirements of the specification, having been designed to perform the bomber role only. On 23 July 1934, the G.4/31 monoplane was damaged in a crash, it was rebuilt as a pre-production series Type 246 to support the latter&#x27;s development.

Andrews observed that the Wellesley absorbed an abnormally high level of engineering development resources, largely due to the novel structure used throughout its airframe. Extensive metallurgical research was needed, along with various structural test rigs to validate the airframe&#x27;s strength. The fabrication of the curved frames needed for its geodesic structure necessitated the development of new powered machinery that greatly improved production times over the hand-operated methods used at the start of the pre-production phase; the same machinery was subsequently used on various wartime and postwar aircraft, such as the Vickers VC10 jetliner. Andrews alleges that Vickers had also considered adopting stressed-skin construction for the Wellesley as well.

===Into production===

During September 1935, an initial order for 96 Type 246s was substituted for the Type 253 order, which received the service name &quot;Wellesley&quot;. In August 1936, the contract was revised, including a new requirement for the production model of the aircraft to be powered by the Bristol Pegasus XX radial engine. On 30 January 1937, the first production Wellesley performed its maiden flight from Brooklands, it was delivered for type tests at RAF Martlesham Heath on 18 March.

The RAF ultimately ordered a total of 176 aircraft to a newly-written Specification 22/35. During March 1937, quantity production of the Wellesley commenced, with all aircraft being produced over a 14 month period. By March 1938, 176 aircraft were in service, 57 of which were on home bases. Around this time, the RAF examined various options for improving the Wellesley, including provisions for a third crew member amidship as a navigator, while the bomb-aimers&#x27; prone position was also an area of attention. Due to vibration encountered when the bomb-container doors were open, these were eliminated with little resulting impact on drag. The Wellesley&#x27;s initial wing lacked sufficient strength, leading to most aircraft being built with a revised design, while eight early examples were later retrofitted with the improved wing.

The Wellesley was a single-engine monoplane with a very high 8.83 aspect ratio wing and a manually operated, retractable undercarriage. As it was not known how the geodetic structure could cope with being disrupted by a bomb bay, the Wellesley&#x27;s bomb load was instead carried in a pair of streamlined panniers underneath the wings. The &quot;Wellesley Mk I&quot; had two cockpits but this was slightly changed in what was unofficially dubbed the &quot;Wellesley Mk II&quot;, whose pilot&#x27;s canopy was extended to cover the navigator/bomb aimer&#x27;s position that had been buried in the fuselage. The gunner retained a separate canopy. Only the pilot was provided with flight controls. The aircraft was furnished with a three-axis autopilot.

==Operational history==

The RAF received its first Wellesleys in April 1937: they served with No. 76 Squadron RAF at Finningley. The aircraft eventually equipped six RAF Bomber Command squadrons in the UK. Five aircraft with provisions for three crew members were modified for long-range work with the RAF Long-Range Development Flight. Additional modifications included the fitting of Pegasus XXII engines and extra fuel tanks. On 5 November 1938, three of these aircraft under command of Squadron Leader Richard Kellett flew non-stop for two days from Ismailia, Egypt to Darwin, Australia setting a world distance record. All three aircraft broke the record, but No. 2 aircraft landed in West Timor, short of the objective. The Wellesley&#x27;s record remained unbroken until November 1945. This flight is still the longest by an aircraft with a single piston engine.

By the outbreak of the Second World War, the Wellesley had been entirely phased out by all home-based squadrons, with only four examples remaining in Britain; however, the type remained in service with three squadrons based in the Middle East. To replace the Wellesley, RAF Bomber Command had received large numbers of more capable twin-engined bombers, such as the Handley Page Hampden, Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and the Vickers Wellington; the latter shared its geodesic structure with the Wellesley.

Following the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the remaining Wellesley squadrons participated in the East African Campaign against Italian forces in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somaliland. Although obsolete, the Wellesley formed a major part of the British Commonwealth bomber forces, mainly carrying out raids targeting Eritrea and northern Ethiopia. Sudan-based Wellesleys carried out their first bombing mission on 11 June 1940, against Asmara in Eritrea. Three days later, they were involved in their first air combat, when &quot;Capitano&quot; Mario Visintini, future top-scoring biplane ace of the Second World War, intercepted a pair of Wellesleys from 14 Squadron on their way to bomb Massawa. Visintini, who was flying a Fiat CR.42 Falco, shot down the aircraft K7743, flown by Pilot Officer Reginald Patrick Blenner Plunkett. It was the first of Visintini&#x27;s 16 air victories in Eastern Africa.

In the early part of the campaign, fighter escort was not available and when caught by CR.42s, Wellesleys proved vulnerable to the Italian biplane fighter. Despite this, the Wellesley continued to be sent on bombing raids, bombing Addis Ababa from Aden on 18 August. The Wellesley continued in use against the Italians over East Africa until November 1941, when Gondar, the last Italian-held town, fell to Commonwealth and Ethiopian forces. The final Wellesley-equipped unit, 47 Squadron, was then switched to maritime reconnaissance duties over the Red Sea, continuing in this role until September 1942.

While the Wellesley was not a significant combat aircraft, the design principles that were tested in its construction were put to good use with the Wellington medium bomber, which became one of the mainstays of Bomber Command in the early years of the European war. During February 1940, three Wellesleys (K7728, K7735 and K8531) were sold to Egypt to serve in the Royal Egyptian Air Force.

<text>USS &quot;Reno&quot; (CL-96) was an updated light cruiser - sometimes referred to as an &quot;&quot;Oakland&quot;-class&quot; - designed and built to specialize in antiaircraft warfare. She was the first warship to be named for the city of Reno, Nevada. was a destroyer named for Lt. Commander Walter E. Reno.

&quot;Reno&quot; was laid down by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, at San Francisco, California, on 1 August 1941. She was launched on 23 December 1942; sponsored by Mrs. August C. Frohlich; and commissioned on 28 December 1943. The USS &quot;Reno&quot; saw combat in the Pacific theater from April 1944 until it was torpedoed and damaged in November that year. The light cruiser was repaired and performed several transport voyages to Europe before being decommissioned in November 1946. 

==Service history==
===Shakedown===

Following a shakedown cruise off the coast of San Diego, the USS &quot;Reno&quot; departed from San Francisco on 14 April 1944, steaming west to join the 5th Fleet, under the command of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. As an active unit in Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force (Task Force 58), &quot;Reno&quot; first came in contact with the enemy while supporting minor air raids against Marcus Island on 19–20 May. Three days later, she also supported air strikes on Japanese-held Wake Island.

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===
During the months of June to July 1944, &quot;Reno&quot; joined the fast aircraft carriers in air attacks against Saipan on 11 June, Pagan Island on 12–13 June, and against the Volcano Islands and the Bonin Islands - namely Iwo Jima, Haha Jima, and Chichi Jima on 15–16 June. Three days later, &quot;Reno&quot; aided in repelling a large-scale Japanese Navy aircraft carrier task force attempt to defeat the American invasion of the Marianas Islands (including Guam, Saipan, and Tinian, during the Battle of the Philippine Sea - the world&#x27;s largest carrier vs. carrier battle of all time, and an overwhelming victory by the U.S. Navy.

===Guam===
From 20 June to 8 July 1944, &quot;Reno&quot; joined operations covering the conquest of Saipan. She then covered amphibious landings on Guam from 17 to 24 July, and two days later, she took part in air strikes against the Palau Islands from 26 to 29 July. The 5th Fleet then became the 3rd Fleet, as Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., rotated in to command this fleet. Doubling back northward again, one more series of air strikes were made on the Bonin Islands on 4–5 August. Then on 7 September, TF 38 (formerly TF 58) returned south to hit the Palaus again.

===Philippines===
After steaming west across the Philippine Sea, &quot;Reno&quot; and TF 38 carried out some of the first American air raids against the Philippines hitting the southern island of Mindanao, and its adjacent islands, from 9–13 September 1944. TF 58 supported the amphibious landings on two of the Palau&#x27;s from 15 to 20 September, and then on 21–22 September, it carried out air strikes against the Manila area of Luzon in the northern Philippines. While striking the island of Nansei Shoto on 8 October, &quot;Reno&quot; and TF 38 came closer to the Japanese Home Islands than any other major units of the U.S. Navy had been during World War II.

During a 3-day series of air strikes by TF 38 on Japanese airfields on the previously-touched island of Formosa from 12 to 14 October 1944, &quot;Reno&quot; shot down at least six enemy aircraft. At the height of this aerial battle, one Imperial Japanese Navy torpedo plane crashed on &quot;Reno&#x27;s&quot; fantail, exploding and partially incapacitating turret #6, but the turret officer in charge succeeded in maintaining his defensive fire against the attacking Japanese planes.

====USS &quot;Princeton&quot;====
On 24 October 1944, four days after the amphibious invasion of Leyte, while supporting air strikes against Japanese airfields on Luzon, TF 38 was subjected to a large-scale air attack by land-based aircraft from Clark Field, Luzon. The light aircraft carrier took the brunt of the attack; she was hit by an aerial bomb and forced to withdraw from the Task Force. &quot;Reno&quot; was assigned to help fight fires on board &quot;Princeton&quot; by bringing her fire hoses to bear, and also to rescue her crewmen. &quot;Reno&quot; closed &quot;Princeton&quot; five times but could not remain on station because of intense heat and smoke from the burning carrier.
While &quot;Reno&quot; was assisting &quot;Princeton&quot;, the carrier began listing and her flight deck struck &quot;Reno&quot;, crushing one of her 40 mm mounts. Efforts to save the aircraft carrier continued, but when &quot;Princeton&quot;″s torpedo warhead magazine exploded, &quot;Reno&quot; was ordered to sink &quot;Princeton&quot; with her own torpedoes. 

On 25 October, having rejoined TF 38, &quot;Reno&quot; and the other warships steamed northward to engage the Japanese Northern Force, setting off the Battle off Cape Engaño, which was the final engagement of the Battle for Leyte Gulf.

====I-41 attack====
On the night of 3 November 1944, well east of the San Bernardino Strait, as part of Admiral Sherman&#x27;s Task Group 3 (TG 38.3) of Task Force (TF 38) Fast Carrier Task Force, &quot;Reno&quot; received two torpedo hits on her port side fired from while escorting . One torpedo lodged in the outer hull of &quot;Reno&quot; and was later defused. The second hit exploded four decks below topside. This was the first time in almost two years that a Japanese submarine successfully attacked a ship operating with fast carriers. Casualties were 46 dead and many injured.

After a night dead in the water, she survived yet another attempt to sink her by an unknown Japanese submarine firing three torpedoes that missed, but was rescued by a destroyer left behind to defend her. &quot;Reno&quot; was towed 1,500 miles (2,400 km) to the major American base at Ulithi Atoll for some temporary repairs by fleet tug . Among other measures taken to reduce topweight, her starboard torpedo tubes were jettisoned to help preserve stability in the damaged state. During this 700-mile voyage, a crew of 242 remained aboard. A total of 1250 tons of seawater was pumped from flooded compartments, a feat noted favorably by Vice Admiral Charles McMorris in his November 1944 endorsement of &quot;Reno&#x27;s&quot; report on the torpedoing. Gunnery officer Arthur R. Gralla received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his role leading the dewatering effort in difficult conditions.

===Repairs in Charleston, South Carolina===
She then steamed under her own power across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal, then to Charleston, S.C., where she entered Charleston Navy Yard on 22 March 1945 for heavy repairs. Emerging seven months later, &quot;Reno&quot; was ordered to the Texas coast, then back to Charleston for the addition of hundreds of bunk spaces. She then reported for &quot;Operation Magic Carpet,&quot; steaming roundtrip twice to Le Havre, France bringing home U.S. Army troops.

===Decommission===
In early 1946, &quot;Reno&quot; steamed to Port Angeles, Washington, where she decommissioned on 4 November 1946, and then entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet, berthed at Bremerton, Washington. Reclassified CLAA-96 18 March 1949, she remained at Bremerton until her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 March 1959. Her hulk was sold on 22 March 1962 to the Coal Export Co., of New York City, for scrapping.

One of &quot;Reno&quot;&#x27;s 5-inch gun turrets was kept for display at the U.S. Navy Museum, in eastern Washington, D.C. The ship&#x27;s bell and flag are on display in City Hall in Reno, Nevada. During the BLM riots in May/June 2020 the flag was taken by a concerned citizen to protect it from being burned after the Reno City Hall and downtown was attacked and looted. It was returned anonymously later with a note that said it &quot;needed protecting.&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Reno&quot; earned three battle stars for World War II service.

<text>The Manx People&#x27;s Political Association (MPPA) was a political party active in the Isle of Man. They first contested elections in the 1946 election to the House of Keys. They were formed as a conservative and anti-socialist alternative to the Manx Labour Party which was running a high-profile electoral campaign and had hopes of emulating the British Labour Party&#x27;s success in the previous year&#x27;s United Kingdom general election. They were similar in many ways to the previous National Party that had been active in Manx politics.

The MPPA fielded four candidates in Douglas and all were successful. This compared to the Labour Party who had nominated 18 candidates and returned only 2 MHKs.

The MPPA withered as their MHKs stepped down from active politics, with subsequent conservatives preferring to contest elections as independents.</text><links>

<text>Strathkelvin () is the strath (valley) of the River Kelvin in west central Scotland, lying north-east of Glasgow. The name Strathkelvin was used between 1975 and 1996 for one of nineteen local government districts in the Strathclyde region.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across mainland Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Strathkelvin was one of nineteen districts created within the region of Strathclyde. The district covered parts of five former districts from the historic counties of Dunbartonshire, Lanarkshire, and Stirlingshire, all of which were abolished at the same time:
*&quot;From Dunbartonshire&quot;
**Kirkintilloch Burgh
**Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld District: the landward (outside a burgh) part of the parish of Kirkintilloch, excluding the parts within the designated area for Cumbernauld New Town
*&quot;From Lanarkshire&quot;
**Bishopbriggs Burgh
**Ninth District: the Chryston and Stepps electoral divisions
*&quot;From Stirlingshire&quot;
**Western No. 3 District, being the parishes of Baldernock and Campsie

The 1973 Act named the new district &quot;Bishopbriggs and Kirkintilloch&quot;. The shadow council elected in 1974 to oversee the transition to the new system requested a change of name to &quot;Strathkelvin&quot;, referring to the area&#x27;s location in the valley or strath of the River Kelvin. The change of name was approved by the government before the new district came into being.

The district was abolished in 1996 under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which replaced regions and districts with unitary council areas. Most of Strathkelvin went to the East Dunbartonshire council area, but the Chryston and Auchinloch area went instead to North Lanarkshire.

The Strathkelvin name is still used in the judicial sheriffdom of &quot;Glasgow and Strathkelvin&quot;.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:

===Leadership===
Full council meetings were chaired by the provost. For the council&#x27;s first couple of years the provost also provided political leadership, chairing the policy and resources and committee. From 1977 onwards the council appointed a separate leader of the council to provide political leadership, with the role of provost thereafter being more ceremonial. The leaders were:

The last leader of the council, Charles Kennedy, went on to be the first leader of the successor East Dunbartonshire Council.

===Elections===
Elections were held as follows:

==Premises==
The council was initially based at several offices across the district. In 1985 it built a new headquarters at the junction of Lenzie Road and Civic Way in Kirkintilloch. The building was called Tom Johnston House, named after Tom Johnston (1881–1965), who was born in Kirkintilloch and had served as Secretary of State for Scotland during the Second World War. After the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996, Tom Johnston House served as the headquarters of the successor East Dunbartonshire Council until 2012, and has subsequently been demolished.

<text>Mark Alan Webber (born 27 August 1976) is an Australian former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . Webber won nine Formula One Grands Prix across 12 seasons. In endurance racing, Webber won the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2015 with Porsche.

Webber began karting at age 12 or 13 and achieved early success, winning regional championships before progressing to car racing in the Australian Formula Ford Championship and the British Formula 3 Championship. He competed for two years opposite Bernd Schneider in the FIA GT Championship with the AMG Mercedes team, finishing runner-up in the 1998 season with five wins in ten races before finishing second in the 2001 International Formula 3000 Championship driving for Super Nova Racing. Webber made his F1 debut with the Minardi team in the 2002 season and finished fifth in his first race, the . He moved to the Jaguar squad for the and 2004 championships. For the 2005 season, he was granted an early release from his contract with Jaguar and joined the Williams team, securing his first podium finish at the . Webber remained at Williams until , driving for the Red Bull team for the rest of his F1 career. He won nine F1 , thirteen pole positions and finished third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in the , and 2013 seasons.

He left Formula One after 2013 and moved to the World Endurance Championship, sharing a Porsche 919 Hybrid with Bernhard and Hartley in the fully-professional Le Mans Prototype 1 class from the 2014 to 2016 seasons. The trio won eight races in the final two seasons and the 2015 World Endurance Drivers&#x27; Championship. He retired from motor sport in 2016, becoming a television pundit for Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 and Australia&#x27;s Network 10 and a driver manager. Webber received the Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 2017 Australia Day Honours. Webber is an inductee of both the Australian Motor Sport Hall of Fame and the FIA Hall of Fame.

==Early and personal life==

On 27 August 1976, Webber was born to middle-class parents, motorcycle dealer and petrol station owner Alan Webber and his wife Diane, in the small New South Wales town of Queanbeyan located in the Tablelands, on the Queanbeyan River banks, near Canberra. His paternal grandfather was a firewood merchant. Webber has an elder sister, Leanne. He was educated at the nearby Isabella Street Primary School and Karabar High School (KHS). Webber represented KHS in athletics and rugby league and did Australian rules football, cricket and swimming after his mother encouraged him to get involved in as many sports as possible. At age 13, he was a ball boy for the rugby league team Canberra Raiders for a year and earned money delivering pizzas in the Canberra and Queanbeyan areas in his late schooling years. Webber also worked as an apprentice plumber and woodcutter. 

Webber lives in the UK, in the small Buckinghamshire village Aston Clinton with his wife Ann Neal, his former manager, and is stepfather to her son from a previous relationship.

==Early racing career==
Webber began driving motorbikes on weekends from about age four or five on his maternal grandfather&#x27;s farm. Webber was not encouraged to seriously take up motorcycling by his father, because he sponsored some local children who were injured in motorbike accidents. At about 12 or 13, he switched to karting, buying a go-kart from a school friend&#x27;s father. He developed himself at a local indoor go-kart centre near his home. Webber received a second-hand worn out go-kart from his father in 1990 and drove it about once a month at the Canberra Go-Kart Club and in meetings in and around Canberra. Andy Lawson, owner of Queanbeyan Kart Centre, built karts around Webber&#x27;s frame and Webber&#x27;s father leased his petrol station and worked long hours at a car dealer to fund his son&#x27;s karting activities. Webber opted for karting, and made his junior-level karting debut in 1991 aged 14, winning the 1992 Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales (NSW) State championships. In 1993, Webber won the Canberra Cup, the King of Karting Clubman Light Class titles, the 1993 Top Gun Award at the Ian Luff Advanced Driving School, and the 1993 NSW Junior National Heavy Championship in a Lawson kart with a larger, more powerful engine.

In 1994, he made his car racing debut, competing in the eight-round Australian Formula Ford Championship featuring non-aerodynamically dependent open-wheel racing vehicles fitted with treaded tyres. He drove Craig Lowndes&#x27; championship-winning 1993 RF93 Van Diemen FF1600 car that his father purchased. Webber achieved a season-high third at Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit for 14th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 30 points and second in the Rookie of the Year standings. He was disqualified from the non-championship Formula Ford support race for passing the field on the formation lap. In late 1994, Webber&#x27;s father asked English-born media officer Ann Neal to locate sponsorship for Webber; Neal located support from the Australian Yellow Pages after she and Webber reviewed six proposals. Webber moved to Sydney from Queanbeyan to be closer to Australia&#x27;s motor racing industry. When not racing, he earned money working part-time as a driving instructor at Oran Park Raceway defensive driving school.

He entered the 1995 Australian Formula Ford Championship with Yellow Pages Racing driving a 1995 Van Diemen car, finishing fourth overall with three victories, three pole positions and 158 points in a high-quality field. Webber finished second at both Mallala Motor Sport Park rounds of the 1995 Australian Drivers&#x27; Championship driving a Birrana Racing Reynard 90D-Holden car for seventh in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 32 points. In October 1995, he moved to the London suburb of Hainault, to further his racing career. He entered the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch with the Van Diemen factory team, and finished the race third. The result impressed team owner Ralph Firman Sr. enough to sign Webber to Van Diemen for both the 1996 European Formula Ford Championship and the 1996 British Formula Ford Championship, finishing third and second overall, respectively. He won four races in the British series, finishing second in the championship behind teammate Kristian Kolby, and was also third in the Formula Ford Euro Cup driving two of the three rounds with a win at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. Webber won the Formula Holden support race, and the Formula Ford Festival.

In 1997, he elected to skip Formula Renault and Formula Vauxhall on sponsors advice, and signed a contract to progress to the higher-tier British Formula Three Championship with Alan Docking Racing (ADR). Webber was ADR&#x27;s lead driver complemented by two funded non-competitive teammates, and was told to bring funding to ADR. Driving a Dallara F397 car powered by an old Mugen Honda engine purchased by the Webber family, he won the Brands Hatch Grand Prix event and came fourth overall with 131 points. Webber was voted Rookie of the Year as 1997&#x27;s highest-placed rookie. His funding almost dried up mid-season until motor racing journalist Peter Windsor suggested Webber solicit funding from rugby union player and family friend David Campese to complete the year and stop Webber ending his international career early. Webber&#x27;s season was put on a race-by-race basis and he received offers from Renault and Jackie Stewart. He also finished third in the Masters of Formula 3 and fourth in the Macau Grand Prix for ADR.

==Sports car racing and International Formula 3000 (1998–2001)==
After testing at the A1 Ring, Webber rejected an offer from Mercedes-Benz motorsports boss Norbert Haug to drive a CLK GTR car at the FIA GT Nürburgring 4 Hours in place of Alexander Wurz. However, he did agree to race for the AMG Mercedes team in the 1998 FIA GT Championship. Haug selected Webber after AMG Mercedes&#x27; Gerhard Ungar liked Webber&#x27;s tenacity. Webber was paired with touring car driver Bernd Schneider, who mentored him driving-wise and in vehicle mechanics. Driving the 1 Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR, he and Schneider won five races and took eight podium finishes, finishing championship runner-up to teammates Klaus Ludwig and Ricardo Zonta after a title duel with the sister team lasting to the season&#x27;s final round.

In June 1998, Webber entered his first 24 Hours of Le Mans having pre-qualified due to Schneider&#x27;s 1997 FIA GT Championship win. He, Ludwig and Schnieder retired their Le Mans-specific CLK-LM car after 75 minutes due to a steering pump fault causing an engine failure. Late in the year, Campese Management managed Webber until Neal resumed her professional relationship with Webber; she suggested that Webber enter the International Formula 3000 (IF3000) in 1999 pending funding. Webber entered the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans after the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) abolished the FIA GT Championship GT1 category due to a lack of manufacturer entries for 1999. Sharing the No. 4 Mercedes-Benz CLR with Jean-Marc Gounon and Marcel Tiemann, a car aerodynamic fault caused Webber to go airborne in qualifying between Mulsanne Corner and Indianapolis corner and on the Mulsanne Straight in race-day warm up, forcing his withdrawal from the race.

Webber&#x27;s relationship with Mercedes-Benz cooled following Le Mans because he felt they were unworried about him. He rejected Haug&#x27;s offer to compete in American open-wheel racing. Greg Moore&#x27;s death in an accident in California in October 1999 prompted Webber to focus on European single-seater racing. His Mercedes-Benz contract was terminated around November following negotiations. Airline magnate Paul Stoddart, through talks with Jordan Grand Prix team owner Eddie Jordan, offered to underwrite $1.1 million for Webber to combine F3000 and planned Formula One (F1) testing. Webber signed to drive a Lola-Ford Zytek car for the Arrows F3000 team in the 2000 IF3000 Championship, finishing third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 21 points, winning at Silverstone, achieving two podium results and retiring four times.

For 2001, he moved to the Benetton Formula-affiliated, reigning teams&#x27; champions Super Nova Racing, replacing Nicolas Minassian. Webber, the title favourite, tended to overestimate the Lola car&#x27;s grip whilst combining F3000 racing with regular access to F1 vehicles for testing. Webber won at Imola, Monaco and Magny-Cours and was second at the Nürburgring. Four consecutive retirements in the final four rounds prevented him from winning the championship, and he scored 39 points, finishing runner-up to Justin Wilson.

==Formula One career (1999–2013)==
===Testing (1999–2001)===
Webber made his F1 test debut with the Arrows team in a two-day session organised by Stoddart at the Circuit de Catalunya in December 1999. Plans to drive the Arrows A21 car at Silverstone in July 2000 was cancelled, when he and Stoddart rejected a binding contract for from team owner Tom Walkinshaw. Webber received a three-day evaluation test at Estoril two months later following talks with Benetton. After that, Webber and his legal team agreed terms with Benetton team owner Flavio Briatore to be Benetton&#x27;s test and reserve driver. He developed the car for racers Jenson Button and Giancarlo Fisichella for 2001 and would replace one of them if they got ill or injured. Webber tested frequently for Benetton and helped to improve the team&#x27;s performance for the season&#x27;s end. He joined Briatore&#x27;s managerial stable in May 2001 on a ten-year contract when Neal said that she wanted to step back from driver management.

===Minardi and Jaguar (2002–2004)===
Ron Walker and telecommunications company Telstra successfully lobbied for Webber to replace Fernando Alonso at Minardi for the first three races of the season. Webber&#x27;s Minardi PS02-Asiatech car was underdeveloped and he was barely able to fit inside it due to his height. He hoped to become experienced enough to make progress in F1. He qualified 18th for the season-opening and finished fifth following a plethora of first-lap retirements in his debut race. Stoddart consequently retained Webber for the rest of the season. At the four races later, Webber and his teammate Alex Yoong were withdrawn from the race due to three wing failures during practice. He outperformed Yoong and the latter&#x27;s two-race replacement Anthony Davidson since he was the only Minardi driver using power steering due to budgetary constraints. Webber frequently beat the Arrows and Toyota teams, and his best result for the rest of the season was eighth at the . Webber was 16th overall with two points.

In 2002, Webber&#x27;s management were concerned about Minardi&#x27;s financial situation. They arranged a test session and evaluation in the more powerful Jaguar R3 in mid-2002. Toyota and Jaguar were interested in Webber, but he joined Jaguar in November 2002, replacing the ageing Eddie Irvine. Webber was underprepared as his Jaguar R4 car had a highly unreliable Cosworth V10 engine and rapidly wearing rear tyres. At the season&#x27;s third round, the , he qualified a season-high third but crashed after losing grip driving through water to cool his tyres late in the rain-affected race. Webber scored points seven times in 2003 with his best result being three sixth-places for 10th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 17 points. Webber crashed less frequently than he had done in F3000, and his qualifying and race pace saw him outperform both Antônio Pizzonia and Wilson. He was touted as a future star despite poor reliability and a weak car package.

Webber was offered a five-year extension to his contract but signed a two-year extension instead. During the season, Webber contributed to the Jaguar R5&#x27;s technical development and was consistent year-round, extracting extra car performance and regularly outperforming his Red Bull-backed teammate Christian Klien. He drove the underperforming and unreliable R5 vehicle causing him to retire from 8 out of 18 races. However, Webber scored points four times with a season-high start of second at the and a best finish of sixth at the . He placed 13th overall with 7 points.

===Williams (2005–2006)===
Frank Williams, the Williams team owner, was interested in Webber and he and Neal thought driving for the team would advance his career. Webber activated a performance clause that released him from Jaguar if an improved offer came along. Williams released Sauber driver Fisichella from his contract with the team and Webber was signed by Williams to replace Fisichella for . He was granted an early release from Jaguar following the season-ending so he could test for Williams, and prepared for the season by doing fitness training with cyclist Lance Armstrong at a training camp in Texas.

Webber replaced the Toyota-bound Ralf Schumacher at Williams, and was joined by Nick Heidfeld for most of the season and Pizzonia for the final five races following injury to Heidfeld. The Williams FW27 car was aerodynamically poor due to incorrectly calibrated wind tunnels, lacked race speed and was poor starting, seeing him lose positions after qualifying well. In a pre-season test session in mid-February, he sustained a broken left-side rib and damaged rib cartilage when he did not exercise correctly prior to driving. In the first two races of the season he competed on painkillers prescribed to him by FIA medical director Gary Hartstein to manage the pain from these injuries. Webber finished third in Monaco for his first F1 podium finish and tallied points in ten races in 2005. His best start was second in Spain and qualified within the top five in the first seven rounds. Webber was involved in five race collisions and burnt his right hip in France due to heat generated by a failed external electronics box penetrating his car&#x27;s cockpit. He was 10th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 36 points, admitting that his reputation faltered. Webber out-qualified Heidfeld nine times, beat him six times and out-qualifying Pizzonia five times that season.

Although Frank Williams and technical director Patrick Head made Webber aware of his poor performance, Webber remained at Williams for since no other driver wanted to drive for the team. He became distant from Williams and disliked its management because he expected to feel comfortable there; he stayed with the team because he felt &quot;there was something left&quot; and was loyal to Williams, and rejected an offer to join the BMW Sauber team. Webber&#x27;s teammate that year was GP2 Series champion Nico Rosberg. His FW28 car ran Bridgestone tyres and a Cosworth V8 engine after BMW ended its partnership with Williams and purchased the Sauber team. His unreliable, under-powered car retired inside the top three in both Australia and Monaco early in 2006. Webber was 14th overall tallying 7 points; his best results were two sixth places in Bahrain and San Marino.

===Red Bull Racing (2007–2013)===

==== 2007–2009 ====
Webber did not re-sign with Williams after he was offered less money for a two-year contract. Webber became disillusioned with F1 because their press relations would not let competitors speak freely to the press. Briatore directed Webber to the Red Bull Racing team; they became interested in the team after they purchased Jaguar in late 2004 and signed world championship-winning technical director Adrian Newey to design the RB3-Renault car. His switch from Williams to Red Bull was confirmed in August 2006, replacing Klien and partnering the experienced David Coulthard. His move to Red Bull had been surprising as it was formed to promote young drivers and the drinks company.

Before the season, Webber enquired about Red Bull adviser and junior formula team owner Helmut Marko for his treatment of young drivers and was told by team principal Christian Horner to obey Marko to avoid conflict. The RB3 proved to be a quick but unreliable car, causing Webber to retire seven times during the season. He scored his first points of 2007 when he finished seventh in the United States and took his second career podium finish with a third-place finish at the three races later. Webber scored once more that year with another seventh place at the . He was on course to finish well at the rain-affected until Toro Rosso&#x27;s Sebastian Vettel crashed into the rear of his car behind the safety car, eliminating both drivers from the race. Webber tallied 10 points for 12th overall and beat his teammate Coulthard 15 times in qualifying.

Webber remained at Red Bull for the season and was again joined by Coulthard, driving a more reliable RB4 car equipped with a new reliable gearbox and a heavier front. Webber frequently qualified well and scored points at nine of the season&#x27;s 18 rounds. He occasionally outperformed drivers with better machinery and he scored points in six of the first eight races, which included a season-high fourth at the . He qualified a season-high second for the but finished tenth in the wet-weather race. Thereafter, Webber&#x27;s performance for the remainder of the season diminished mainly because Red Bull opted to sacrifice speed so it could focus on constructing a new car to comply with the regulation changes being applied for the championship. He scored points three more times in the final nine races for 21 points and 11th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Because of Red Bull&#x27;s performance, Webber remained at the team for 2009. 
Webber sustained multiple injuries in a head-on collision with a car at a charity endurance cycling event in Port Arthur, Tasmania in November 2008, including a fractured right leg. He skipped a three-day pre-season test session held at the Jerez circuit, but was able to regain enough fitness to drive in an F1 car at the 2009 pre-season test sessions at Jerez and Barcelona, due to the late launch of the RB5 car. Webber underwent surgery between events to avoid contracting infections.

Vettel, who was promoted from Toro Rosso to replace the retiring Coulthard, became Webber&#x27;s teammate. Webber consistently scored points in seven of the first eight races, including three podium finishes to briefly become a championship contender. His performances improved when the new RB5 car&#x27;s double diffuser was introduced. At the , Webber overcame a drive-through penalty he incurred for a first-lap collision with Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s Brawn GP car to achieve his first career victory from his maiden pole position. Webber was informed by Red Bull that he and Vettel could race each other &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot; even when trying to reduce Button&#x27;s points lead. He moved to second overall after finishing third in Hungary but fell to fourth due to driver, team and reliability errors in the next four races. At the season&#x27;s penultimate round, the , Webber took his second career victory and held off Button to finish second at the season&#x27;s final race in Abu Dhabi for fourth overall and 69.5 points.

==== 2010–2013 ====
Webber and Red Bull negotiated a contract extension to the championship to reward his performance in 2009. His RB6 car was designed to channel engine exhaust gases through a bodywork slot to the diffuser&#x27;s central area for more downforce and cornering speed. A knee injury sustained while biking forced Webber to delay his preparation because a surgeon conducted a full knee incision. Inactivity during surgery increased Webber&#x27;s weight to ; a strict diet kept his weight at . Upon his return to racing, he led the Drivers&#x27; Championship at various points during the season, achieving four Grand Prix victories and three pole positions. An accident with Rosberg at the and a second-place finish at the following put Webber eight points behind Alonso and seven ahead of Vettel entering the season-ending . Webber needed to win the race and for Alonso to place third or lower to secure the championship. He was eighth in the race, which Vettel won and Alonso came seventh. Webber was third overall with 242 points. After the season, Webber was angry with Red Bull&#x27;s management, thinking they devalued his achievements that year. He collided with Vettel in a duel for the lead at the , which cooled his relationship with Marko who blamed Webber for the accident and favoured Vettel, something Webber felt again after Vettel received a new front wing intended for Webber at the .

He signed a Red Bull contract extension for the season before the , having agreed with the team to sign one-year contracts late in his career for ability and quality assessment. Webber&#x27;s mental state worsened because he was ready to retire after a title win to stop all negativity related to his racing career. His RB7 car equipped with the kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) and drag reduction system devices and an exhaust-blown diffuser produced lots of rear grip. Webber was hindered by intermittent KERS failures that Red Bull rectified and he was frustrated with the quickly degrading Pirelli tyres losing their performance when a driver was in the aerodynamic turbulence of another car. He made slower starts due to the car&#x27;s ballast distribution compromised by the KERS&#x27; additional weight exacerbated by him weighing more than Vettel.

Dietrich Mateschitz, Red Bull&#x27;s owner, directed the team to allow both Webber and Vettel to race each other. Webber came no lower than fifth in the first four races, finishing third and second in China and Turkey. He finished the fourth from pole position. Webber took consecutive pole positions at the British and German Grands Prix and seven podiums from eleven top-tens in the next 13 events. He won the season-ending to take third overall from Alonso with a career-high 258 points. Webber initially struggled with the new Pirelli tyres, producing a greater amount of lateral load than his teammate Vettel and was more aggressive accelerating. His qualifying and race performances improved once he became better acquainted with the tyres. Webber made fewer pit stops by copying strategies used by other drivers after previously stopping more often from racing competitively.

Webber signed to remained at Red Bull for the season on the day of the . Webber&#x27;s decision to re-sign was made more difficult in mid-2011 because of his poor qualifying performance on Pirelli tyres but noted the potential of Newey&#x27;s car designs. The RB8 car was not as dominant as its two predecessors; Webber finished fourth in the first four races, hampered by minor mechanical problems and faulty KERS. He became frustrated with F1 racing after a poor performance at the but he won the from pole position and the three races later after passing Alonso with eight laps left to go second overall behind Alonso. Webber took two more podium finishes in Korea and India during the season&#x27;s final 11 races, finishing 2012 sixth overall tallying 179 points.

Webber remained at Red Bull for the championship: he wanted to honour an earlier promise he had made to Horner and Mateschitz to stay at the team until his F1 career was over. He rejected an offer from Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali to partner Alonso and replace Felipe Massa for a year with a second optional, feeling switching teams would be inappropriate. He briefly lightened his training over the pre-season period when a titanium rod in his right leg was removed in December 2012. After restarting training that month, Webber decided to retire from F1 after 2013 because he wanted to spend more time with his family, demotivation with F1 since drivers could not criticise Pirelli&#x27;s tyres for fear of possibly upsetting others and the politics when large sums of money were involved. Webber was assigned Simon Rennie as his race engineer when his previous engineer, Ciaron Pilbeam, became the Lotus team&#x27;s chief race engineer.

His RB9 car initially struggled possibly due to its aerodynamic profile on the new softer Pirelli compounds but performed better when the 2012 compounds were re-introduced mid-season. At the , the season&#x27;s second round, Webber was overtaken by Vettel in the closing laps to win the race after Vettel ignored the team order &quot;Multi-Map 21&quot;, which instructed him to finish behind Webber. Tension between both drivers rose as a result and a remark by Webber about Vettel making an independent decision to disobey team orders meant Vettel lost Webber&#x27;s respect as a person. After that, Webber was aware that the rest of the season would be onerous and tension between him and Vettel would stress Red Bull. He took eight podium finishes, finishing second four more times at the , the , the from pole position and the season-ending . Webber won no races in 2013 and he concluded his final F1 season in third overall with 199 points.

==Return to endurance racing with Porsche (2014–2016)==
Webber joined Porsche&#x27;s sports car team upon its return to motor racing in mid-2013. He moved to sports car racing to get away from the attention associated with F1 and to enjoy the longer intervals between races. Webber shared the No. 20 closed-cockpit Porsche 919 Hybrid sports prototype car with German Timo Bernhard and New Zealander Brendon Hartley in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC)&#x27;s fully-professional Le Mans Prototype 1-Hybrid (LMP1-H) category.

Although sports car racing was less physically demanding for Webber, he needed consistently high concentration to cope with the difference in speed between each of the WEC&#x27;s four classes, driving at night, re-adjusting to lapping slower vehicles while losing the least amount of time and coping with changeable conditions during a long race. Webber was advised on modern sports car racing by Bernhard and in turn acquainted Bernhard and Hartley with the circuits he drove in F1. He was mindful on developing the car for his co-drivers and not for himself but directed Porsche to concentrate on research and development projects that optimised performance in the shortest possible time. Webber also helped the team reduce the amount of pit stop time.

The 2014 season began with Webber qualifying sixth and finishing third at the season-opening 6 Hours of Silverstone. Hybrid technical issues at the following 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps left Webber and his co-drivers 23rd overall. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Webber&#x27;s team qualified the No. 20 car second and retired with a broken anti-roll bar 22 hours in. The next four races saw him finish no lower than sixth, placing third at both the 6 Hours of Fuji and the 6 Hours of Bahrain. At the season-ending 6 Hours of São Paulo, his team qualified on pole position; late in the race, Matteo Cressoni&#x27;s No. 90 AF Corse-run 8 Star Motorsports Ferrari 458 Italia hit the right-rear of his car, sending Webber into a concrete barrier. Webber sustained a left lung contusion and severe concussion, recovering from the effects of the crash weeks later. He was ninth in the World Endurance Drivers&#x27; Championship (WEDC) with 64.5 points.

Porsche retained Webber for the 2015 season alongside Bernhard and Hartley in the renumbered No. 17 car. Webber and Hartley qualified the car on pole position for the season-opening 6 Hours of Silverstone but Webber had to retire it with drivetrain failure. He was on pole position at the following 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and finished third after Hartley incurred a stop-and-go penalty for rejoining the track via an escape road. He qualified and finished second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. before claiming four consecutive victories to enter the season-ending 6 Hours of Bahrain leading Audi&#x27;s Marcel Fässler, André Lotterer and Benoît Tréluyer by 12 points. Webber and his teammates needed to finish third to win the WEDC. They qualified on pole position and overcame mechanical problems to finish fifth and claim the title with 166 points, five ahead of Fässler, Lotterer and Tréluyer.

Webber again remained at Porsche alongside Bernhard and Hartley in the renumbered No. 1 entry for the 2016 championship. The crew retired from the season-opening 6 Hours of Silverstone following a collision between Hartley and a slower Porsche GT car. At the following 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, two tyre punctures and a front axle gearbox problem left him 27th overall. Webber began from second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and finished 13th overall due to a water pump failure that needed fixing when Webber was driving. The rest of the season saw the crew win four of the next six races and qualify on pole position once for fourth in the WEDC with 134.5 points.

==Retirement (2017–present)==
Webber decided to retire from motor racing after the season was over. He kept the news secret until going to Japan, citing Porsche&#x27;s dwindling desire to commit fully to its LMP1 programme and the difficulty of doing &quot;this job half-hearted&quot; with regards of getting motivated to do test sessions and races as reasons.

Webber was due to compete in the American-based short track oval racing series Superstar Racing Experience in 2021; travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic meant Webber was ultimately unable to do this.

==Driving style==
In describing Webber&#x27;s driving style, journalist Mark Hughes stated: &quot;The thing he does arguably better than anyone else, is extract every ounce of potential from the car through fast, aerodynamically-loaded corners&quot; since extra lap time could be located in slower turns because the car remains in them for longer. He was able to feel the braking grip of his tyres and could correctly modulate throttle power as grip levels reduced under braking to slow the vehicle down. Entering a braking zone, Webber achieved more retardation rate in a downforce-reliant car than other drivers and as the downforce decreased he was able to modulate pressure and sensitivity well to remain within the tyre&#x27;s grip limit. His braking pressure force enabled him to translate lap time where the entry speed is high enough to make this possible without brake locking. His driving style, which was refined in downforce-heavy sports cars in the late 1990s, was not suited to a more gentle approach required for driving V8 F1 Pirelli-shod cars because of how he managed those brand of tyres that wore out faster than the Bridgestone compounds he was accustomed to.

==Non-driving work==
Webber is a brand ambassador of the luxury fashion house Hugo Boss, the car brand Porsche, the watch manufacturer Rolex, the synthetic engine oil brand Mobil 1, the airline carrier Qantas, and the spinal cord injury research charity Wings for Life. In July 2003, he helped to launch that year&#x27;s Road Safety Handbook aiming to give road safety guides for residents of Milton Keynes. As a result of his endorsement money and salary, he was included in Australia&#x27;s Top 50 Sports Earners and the BRW Young Rich lists by BRW magazine. From 2009 to 2013, Webber and Horner co-owned the MW Arden junior team that ran in the European-based GP3 Series. He launched the off-road sports clothing brand Aussie Grit for mountain riding and running in 2018, and fronted Porsche and Boss&#x27; clothing collections for 2019 and 2020.

In 2003, Webber began the ten-day adventure challenge trek Mark Webber Challenge featuring cross-country running, cycling and kayaking in Tasmania to raise money for children&#x27;s cancer charities. He organised it following his grandfather&#x27;s death from cancer as well as his experiences of friends whose children had cancer. Webber held the challenge again from 2006 to 2008 but not in 2009 and 2010 due to economical problems. He again held the event with corporate and local government sponsorship from 2011 to 2013. Inspire Young People and Webber created the Mark Webber Youth Challenge in 2014 involving college student teams raising money for charity participating in physical activities. He was patron of the Amy Gillett Foundation promoting safer on-road relationships between cyclists and motorists, and of the Aylesbury College Trust. Webber won the F1 pro-am tennis tournament in Barcelona three times. He supported the use of the AI-operated prostate cancer diagnosis device Maxwell Plus in Queanbeyan in November 2021 following a reduction in testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Webber became an ambassador of the Amber Foundation youth homeless charity in March 2023.

Webber has written columns for &quot;Autosport&quot;, the BBC, and &quot;The Sydney Daily Telegraph&quot;. He has provided expert analysis on F1 for the British television broadcaster Channel 4 since the season. Webber has done a similar role for Australia&#x27;s Channel 10, covering the Australian Grand Prix and co-hosting the 2015 Clipsal 500 of the V8 Supercars Championship for the broadcaster. He was guest reporter for two rounds of the 2017 World Rally Championship on Red Bull TV. Since early 2020, Webber has mentored racing driver Oscar Piastri and represents his commercial interests through the management arm JAM Sports Management he founded with his wife, and corporate and sports CEO Jason Allen. He authored the book, &quot;Up Front – 2010, A Season To Remember&quot;, in 2010. Webber&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Aussie Grit: My Formula One Journey&quot;, ghost written by Stuart Sykes, was published in 2015. Webber owned a public house, The Stag, in Mentmore. He joined documentary makers Noah Media Group as a producer and an investor in November 2021.

==Assessment and honours==

Webber is nicknamed &quot;Aussie Grit&quot; for &quot;his determination in the face of adversity and his patriotism.&quot; Bruce Jones described Webber in the book &quot;The Story of Formula One: 65 Years of Life in the Fast Lane&quot; as having earned &quot;considerable admiration for his straight-talking, honest approach that was devoid of pretence or hyperbole. He is an out-and-out racer cast from something of an old-fashioned mould and as such often seemed an adult in an increasingly infantile world.&quot; BBC Sport&#x27;s Andrew Benson wrote that Webber&#x27;s &quot;combination of race-winning pace and forthright manner has made him a central figure in F1 over the last decade&quot; and that Webber had &quot;remained true to himself. He is unimpressed with the trappings of F1 and its supposed glamour. And his willingness to follow his own mind is intact.&quot;

In October 2003, Webber was unanimously voted fourth director of the trade union Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (GPDA). He was voted out of it in September 2005 since it felt there were too many directors in charge. Webber was voted back in the GPDA as a director in September 2006, resigning in March 2010. He won the BRDC Bruce McLaren Award in 1998, 2000, 2001, 2009, and 2010 as &quot;the Commonwealth driver who has established the most meritorious performances in international motor racing.&quot; In October 2000, he received the Australian Sports Medal for placing second in the 1998 FIA GT Championship and participating in the IF3000 Championship; was voted &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; by both readers of &quot;F1 Racing&quot; and &quot;Autosport&quot; magazines; named &quot;F1 Newcomer of the Year&quot; at the annual Grand Prix Party Awards; was named &quot;Autocar&quot;&#x27;s magazine; 2003 F1 Driver of the Year; won the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy in 2006; and the 2009 Innes Ireland Trophy for displaying &quot;courage and sportsmanship&quot; that Innes Ireland epitomised.

Webber received the Hawthorn Memorial Trophy in 2010 and 2013 as the most successful British or Commonwealth driver during a season; the 2010 GQ Australia Sportsman of the Year; the 2011 DHL Fastest Lap Award for setting more fastest laps than any driver that year with seven; and the 2013 Johnny Wakefield Trophy for recording the year&#x27;s best lap on the Silverstone GP Circuit. He was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 2017 Australia Day Honours for &quot;distinguished service to motor sport as a competitor and ambassador, and to the community through fundraising and patronage of a range of medical and youth support organisations.&quot; Webber was added to the Australian Motor Sport Hall of Fame and the FIA Hall of Fame in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2022, he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

<text>USS &quot;Roanoke&quot; (CL-145) was the second ship of the light cruisers completed for the U.S. Navy shortly after the end of World War II. Commissioned in 1949, she served in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Pacific before being decommissioned in 1958. She was sold for scrap in 1972.

==Construction and Commissioning==

&quot;Roanoke&quot; was laid down on 15 May 1945 by the New York Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, New Jersey; launched on 16 June 1947; sponsored by Miss Julia Ann Henebry; and commissioned at Philadelphia on 4 April 1949.

Following a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean, &quot;Roanoke&quot; undertook maneuvers in the Atlantic as a unit of the Battleship-Cruiser Force and on 6 January 1950 got underway to join the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean for her first extended deployment. Returning to the United States in May, she alternated 6th Fleet deployments with operations in the western Atlantic until the summer of 1952 when she added a midshipman&#x27;s cruise to Europe and the Caribbean to her schedule. Continuing to operate in the Battleship-Cruiser Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet until the fall of 1955, &quot;Roanoke&quot; completed her sixth Mediterranean deployment in May, then prepared for transfer to the Pacific Fleet.

On 22 September 1955, &quot;Roanoke&quot; departed Norfolk, Va., for the Panama Canal. Homeported at Long Beach, she conducted nine Naval Reserve cruises and completed three WestPac cruises, May to December 1956, September 1957 to March 1958, and September to October 1958, before decommissioning on 31 October 1958.

=== Decommissioning ===
She was berthed at Mare Island in 1963 until sold to the Levin Metals Corporation of San Jose, California on 22 February 1972.

Her bell can be seen on display outside of Elmwood Park which is inside Roanoke Public Library. &quot;Roanoke&quot;’s model is on display in the Virginia Museum of Transportation, Roanoke, Virginia.

<text>The third USS &quot;Rochester&quot; (CA-124), an , was laid down 29 May 1944 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 28 August 1945; sponsored by Mrs. M. Herbert Eisenhart, wife of the president of Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co., Rochester, New York; and commissioned 20 December 1946 at the Boston Navy Yard.

&quot;Rochester&quot; departed Provincetown, Mass., 22 February 1947 for shakedown out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. By the end of April, she was at Philadelphia, ready to commence nine extended naval reserve training cruises which took her north to Casco Bay and south to the Caribbean.

==1940s==
Upon completion of her ninth reserve training cruise in the second week of January 1948, &quot;Rochester&quot; prepared for Mediterranean service. Departing Philadelphia 20 February, she arrived at Gibraltar 1 March, and became flagship for Admiral Forrest Sherman, Commander, 6th Fleet. In addition to calling at several ports, the cruiser waited out the events of the Palestinian crisis, at Suda Bay on the northern coast of Crete. She completed her tour 14 June; Admiral Sherman shifted his flag to light cruiser &quot;Fargo&quot; (CL-106), and &quot;Rochester&quot; departed for Philadelphia the 15th, arriving 27 June. &quot;Rochester&quot; then resumed reserve training duty, making cruises to Bermuda, to New Brunswick, and to Jamaica.

After shore bombardment exercises at Bloodsworth Island in early October 1948, &quot;Rochester&quot; reported to the South Boston Naval Shipyard for her first overhaul which included removal of her catapults and conversion of her aviation section from seaplanes to helicopters. Her new aviation detachment consisted of four Sikorsky HO3S-1 utility helicopters.

She then operated in the Caribbean and along the North Atlantic coast until she stood out from Narragansett Bay on 5 January 1950 and steamed for the west coast, and a new homeport, Long Beach, California.

==Transfer to Pacific==
In April 1950, &quot;Rochester&quot; departed Long Beach for the South Pacific. After calling at Pearl Harbor, she embarked Adm. Arthur W. Radford, Commander-in Chief, Pacific Fleet, for a tour of the U.S. Trust Territories. Upon completion of this tour, Vice Admiral A. D. Struble, Commander, 7th Fleet, was received on board at Guam. Rochester then set course for the Philippine Islands.

==Korean War Service==
She was at Sangley Point, Philippine Islands, when president Truman ordered the 7th Fleet into action, and was operating with Carrier Task Force 77 on the morning of 3 July 1950 when the first U.N. air raids against North Korean forces were launched. On 18 and 19 July 1950, &quot;Rochester&quot; supported landings on Pohang Dong by the Army&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division. She continued to serve with Task Force 77 until 25 August 1950.

Vice Admiral Struble&#x27;s flagship, commanded by Capt. Edward L. Woodyard, &quot;Rochester&#x27;s&quot; guns provided support for the troops that landed at Inchon on 13 September in the operation that prompted General MacArthur&#x27;s proud signal that &quot;the Navy and Marines have never shone more brightly than this morning.&quot;

Just before daylight at 0550 on 17 September, a North Korean Yak-9 and an II-2 made an attack run on the cruiser &quot;Rochester&quot;, anchored off Wolmi-do. Initially the aircraft were thought to be friendly until they dropped four bombs over the American ship. All but one missed and the one that did hit smashed the &quot;Rochester&quot;″s crane and failed to detonate. There were no American casualties in the skirmish and they painted a Purple Heart on the crane as a reminder of how close the ship came to being heavily damaged. After the bombing of the &quot;Rochester&quot;, she and the nearby cruiser HMS &quot;Jamaica&quot; opened fire with naval guns. The North Korean II-2 then strafed the British cruiser, resulting in one sailor killed and two wounded. At about the same time, shots from the &quot;Jamaica&quot; hit the II-2 and it crashed into the water. It became the first and only shootdown of an attacking plane with naval gunfire in the Korean War. The Yak-9 fled after losing its partner.

During the months of October, November, and December, &quot;Rochester&quot; operated continuously along the Korean coast for 81 days, providing gunfire support to troops ashore and serving as a mobile helicopter base. Helos were kept aloft constantly to aid the minesweepers in opening the ports of Changjon, Koje, Wonsan, Hungnam, and Songjin. In addition to destroying six mines by her own gunfire, the cruiser controlled naval air operations in the Wonsan area during the 10 days preceding the arrival of landing forces. Her helicopters also aided in the rescue of survivors from the minesweepers &quot;Pirate&quot; (AM-275) and &quot;Pledge&quot; (AM-277), sunk in Wonsan Harbor.

During 198 days of operations against the Communist forces in Korea, she steamed over 25,000 miles and expended 3,265 eight-inch and 2,339 five-inch projectiles. &quot;Rochester&quot; then called at Sasebo, Japan, and on 10 January 1951 headed for home, arriving at Long Beach 30 January. Ten days later she steamed for her scheduled yard overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, San Francisco, which took her through May.

During refresher training in the Long Beach-San Diego area, &quot;Rochester&quot; assisted in training crews for the ships that were being taken out of mothballs. She departed Long Beach 27 August 1951 for training in the Hawaiian area, after which she steamed for Yokosuka, Japan, arriving there 21 November. On 28 November, she blasted Kosong with more than 250 rounds of high explosive.

She then ranged the entire northeastern Korean coastline, bombarding ground targets, while her helicopters flew rescue missions for Task Force 77 aviators. Into the spring she continued harassment and interdiction missions along the eastern coast of Korea.

In early April 1952, she spent a week as flagship of the Blockading and Escorting Forces on Korea&#x27;s west coast, and in late April, she steamed for her homeport. May through October was given over to in-port time at Long Beach and to coastal training operations. In November, the cruiser departed for another WestPac tour, arriving back on station as a unit of Task Group 77.1 (Support Group) in the waters off eastern Korea 7 December.

After spending the winter months in harassment and interdiction missions and other operations with the fast carrier task force, &quot;Rochester&quot; steamed home, arriving Long Beach, 6 April 1953.

==Post-Korean War and fate==
During her regularly scheduled yard period at Mare Island, 4 May to 7 September 1953, her 20 mm. and 40 mm. batteries were replaced with 3 inch/50 rapid-fire guns. Coastal refresher training was followed by a 5 January 1954 departure for Western Pacific (WestPac). The normal exercises and port calls of a WestPac deployment ended with her departure from Yokosuka 29 May for the west coast.

In February 1955, &quot;Rochester&quot; served on her fifth WestPac deployment, completing that cruise 6 August and arriving at her homeport the 22d. An overhaul at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard commenced 19 November 1955 and was completed 7 March 1956. Thence came refresher training and preparations for yet another WestPac deployment. This sixth Pacific tour commenced 29 May when &quot;Rochester&quot; and her escorts stood out of Long Beach. It was 16 December when the ships returned to homeport.

The first week of June 1957 found &quot;Rochester&quot; in San Francisco, where she acted as flagship for Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz as he reviewed the 1st Fleet. Returning to Long Beach the 18th, she resumed local operations and exercises until her departure on 3 September for her seventh WestPac deployment. She returned to Long Beach 24 March 1958. Two more WestPac deployments followed, 6 January to 17 June 1959 and 5 April to 29 October 1960.

While planning was in place to convert her into the guided missile cruiser CG-13, funds were not appropriated and &quot;Rochester&quot; was ordered to report to the Commander, Bremerton Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet on 15 April 1961 for inactivation. She departed Long Beach 12 April, reported to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and she was placed out of commission, in reserve, 15 August 1961. She remained at Bremerton until struck from the Navy list on 1 October 1973 and sold to Zidell Explorations, Portland, Oregon on 31 July 1974 and scrapped.

<doc id="564173" wikidata="Q223400" url="?curid=564173" title="Euro NCAP">
<text>The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) is a European voluntary car safety performance assessment programme (i.e. a New Car Assessment Program) based in Leuven, Belgium. Formed in 1996, the first results were released in February 1997. It was originally started by the Transport Research Laboratory for the UK Department for Transport but later backed by several European governments, as well as by the European Union (EU). Their slogan is &quot;For Safer Cars&quot;.

==History and activities==
Euro NCAP is a voluntary vehicle safety rating system created by the Swedish Road Administration, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile and International Consumer Research &amp; Testing, backed by fourteen members, and motoring and consumer organisations in several EU countries. They provide European consumers with information regarding the safety of passenger vehicles. In 1998, operations moved from London to Brussels.

The programme is modelled after the New Car Assessment Program, introduced 1979 by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Other areas with similar (but not identical) programmes include Australia and New Zealand with ANCAP, Latin America with Latin NCAP, Japan with JNCAP and China with C-NCAP.

Euro NCAP publish safety reports on new cars, and awards &#x27;star ratings&#x27; based on the performance of the vehicles in a variety of crash tests, including front, side and pole impacts, and impacts with pedestrians. Testing is not mandatory, with vehicle models either being independently chosen by Euro NCAP or sponsored by the manufacturers. 

In Europe, new cars are certified as legal for sale under the Whole Vehicle Type Approval regimen that differs from Euro NCAP. According to Euro NCAP, &quot;The frontal and side impact crash tests used by Euro NCAP are based on those used in European legislation. However, much higher performance requirements are used by Euro NCAP.&quot; Euro NCAP also states that &quot;legislation sets a minimum compulsory standard whilst Euro NCAP is concerned with best possible current practice. Progress with vehicle safety legislation can be slow, particularly as all EU Member States’ views have to be taken into account. Also, once in place, legislation provides no further incentive to improve, whereas Euro NCAP provides a continuing incentive by regularly enhancing its assessment procedures to stimulate further improvements in vehicle safety.&quot;

Before Euro NCAP was introduced car buyers had little information if one car was safer than the other; the UK at the time required only a frontal crash test. The first ratings of a group of best selling vehicles were released in 1997, since then Euro NCAP has tested more than 1,800 new cars, published over 600 ratings and has helped save upwards of 78,000 lives in Europe, and encouraged manufacturers to build safer cars. As a result of Euro NCAP, European automakers&#x27; cars have become much safer over the years. Test results are commonly presented by motor press, and in turn, greatly influence consumer demand for a vehicle. One notable example of this is the Rover 100 (an update of a 1980 design, first marketed as an Austin), which after receiving a one-star Adult Occupant Rating in the tests in 1997, suffered from poor sales and was withdrawn from production soon afterwards. BMW&#x27;s 2007 Mini had its bonnet and headlamp fixture changed to meet the latest pedestrian safety requirements. In 2017, to celebrate Euro NCAP&#x27;s 20th anniversary, they tested a 1997 Rover 100 and 2017 Honda Jazz under the same frontal offset conditions to demonstrate how far safety has come in Europe.

== 2020 test procedures ==
A full test can take up to six weeks:

=== Mobile progressive deformable barrier ===
The test car is propelled at into a moving deformable barrier mounted on an oncoming trolley, also travelling at 50 km/h at a 50% overlap. This represents hitting a mid-size family car. Two adult male dummies are seated in the front (a THOR-50M driver and a Hybrid-III 50M passenger) and two child dummies (a 6 year old and a 10 year old) are placed in the back. The aim is to assess the crumple zones and the compatibility of the test car.

=== Full width rigid barrier ===
The test car is driven into a rigid barrier with full overlap at a speed of . A small 5th Percentile dummy is seated in the driving position and in the rear seat. The aim is to test the car&#x27;s restraint system, such as airbags and seat belts.

=== Mobile side impact barrier ===
A deformable barrier is mounted on a trolley and is driven at into the side of the stationary test vehicle at a right angle. This is meant to represent another vehicle colliding with the side of a car.

=== Side pole ===
The car is propelled sideways at against a rigid, narrow pole at a small angle away from perpendicular to simulate a vehicle travelling sideways into roadside objects such as a tree or pole.

=== Far side impact ===
The body in white (frame) of the vehicle is attached to a sled is propelled sideways to provide accelerations experienced by the vehicle in the side and pole tests, but on the far side of the vehicle. The far side testing was implemented in 2020 to help combat far side injuries (where the driver is struck from the opposite side). The ‘excursion’ of the dummy - the extent to which the dummy moves towards the impacted side of the vehicle - is measured.

If the vehicle is equipped with centre airbags then a co-driver (front passenger) is added in either the mobile side impact or the pole test to evaluate its effectiveness.

=== Whiplash ===
The vehicle seat is propelled forwards rapidly at both to test the seat and head restraint&#x27;s capabilities to protect the head and neck against whiplash during a rear impact.

=== Vulnerable road users (pedestrians and cyclists) ===
*Head impact
*Upper leg impact
*Lower leg impact
*AEB pedestrian
*AEB cyclist

Source

=== Safety Assist ===
*AEB car-to-car
*Occupant status monitoring
*Speed assistance
*Lane support
Source

=== Rescue and extrication ===
How easy it is for first responders to extricate the occupant and how well eCall performs after a collision.

== Ratings ==
Euro NCAP&#x27;s ratings consist of percentage scores for Adult Occupant, Child Occupant, Vulnerable Road Users and Safety Assist and are delivered in the overall rating of stars, 5 being the best and 0 being the worst.

*5 star safety: Overall excellent performance in crash protection and well equipped with comprehensive and robust crash avoidance technology
*4 star safety: Overall good performance in crash protection and all round; additional crash avoidance technology may be present
*3 star safety: At least average occupant protection but not always equipped with the latest crash avoidance features
*2 star safety: Nominal crash protection but lacking crash avoidance technology
*1 star safety: Marginal crash protection and little in the way of crash avoidance technology
*0 star safety: Meeting type-approval standards so can legally be sold but lacking critical modern safety technology

Some cars have dual ratings as the lower is for the vehicle with standard equipment, while the higher is for the vehicle when equipped with certain options, often in the form of a safety pack.

NCAP ratings are valid for a region. Some cars have less standard equipment as imported by other countries.

==Euro NCAP Advanced==

Euro NCAP Advanced is a reward system launched in 2010 for advanced safety technologies, complementing Euro NCAP&#x27;s existing star rating scheme. Euro NCAP rewards and recognises car manufacturers that make available new safety technologies which demonstrate a scientifically proven safety benefit for consumers and society, but are not yet considered in the star rating By rewarding technologies, Euro NCAP provides an incentive to manufacturers to accelerate the standard fitment of important safety equipment across their model ranges. 

== Rating history ==
As of 2024, many cars make excessive use of touchscreens, so this will be penalized starting in 2026.

== Comparison groups ==
The results are grouped into 13 increasingly demanding classes:

* 1997-2002 (archive)
* 2003-2007 (archive)
* 2008 (archive)
* 2009 (archive)
* 2010-2011 (archive)
* 2012 (archive)
* 2013 (archive)
* 2014 (archive)
* 2015 (archive)
* 2016-2017
* 2018-2019
* 2020-2022
* 2023-2025
* 2026-2028
* 2029+

== Quadricycle ratings ==
There is a different quadricycle rating for four-wheeled micro cars.

== Members and test facilities ==

There are many members and test facilities throughout Europe.

<doc id="564174" wikidata="Q210784" url="?curid=564174" title="The Idiot">
<text>The Idiot (pre-reform Russian: ; post-reform ) is a novel by the 19th-century Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was first published serially in the journal &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; in 1868–1869.

The title is an ironic reference to the central character of the novel, Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin, a young prince whose goodness, open-hearted simplicity, and guilelessness lead many of the more worldly characters he encounters to mistakenly assume that he lacks intelligence and insight. In the character of Prince Myshkin, Dostoevsky set himself the task of depicting &quot;the positively good and beautiful man.&quot; The novel examines the consequences of placing such a singular individual at the centre of the conflicts, desires, passions, and egoism of worldly society, both for the man himself and for those with whom he becomes involved.

Joseph Frank describes &quot;The Idiot&quot; as &quot;the most personal of all Dostoevsky&#x27;s major works, the book in which he embodies his most intimate, cherished, and sacred convictions.&quot; It includes descriptions of some of his most intense personal ordeals, such as epilepsy and mock execution, and explores moral, spiritual, and philosophical themes consequent upon them. His primary motivation in writing the novel was to subject his own highest ideal, that of true Christian love, to the crucible of contemporary Russian society.

The artistic method of conscientiously testing his central idea meant that the author could not always predict where the plot was going as he was writing. The novel has an awkward structure, and many critics have commented on its seemingly chaotic organization. According to Gary Saul Morson, &quot;&quot;The Idiot&quot; violates every critical norm and yet somehow manages to achieve real greatness.&quot; Dostoevsky himself was of the opinion that the experiment was not entirely successful, but the novel remained his favourite among his works. In a letter
to Strakhov he wrote: &quot;Much in the novel was written hurriedly, much is too diffuse and did not turn out well, but some of it did turn out well. I do not stand behind the novel, but I do stand behind the idea.&quot;

==Background==
In September 1867, when Dostoevsky began work on what was to become &quot;The Idiot&quot;, he was living in Switzerland with his new wife Anna Grigoryevna, having left Russia in order to escape his creditors. They were living in extreme poverty, and constantly had to borrow money or pawn their possessions. They were evicted from their lodgings five times for non-payment of rent, and by the time the novel was finished in January 1869 they had moved between four different cities in Switzerland and Italy. During this time Dostoevsky periodically fell into the grip of his gambling addiction and lost what little money they had on the roulette tables. He was subject to regular and severe epileptic seizures, including one while Anna was going into labor with their daughter Sofia, delaying their ability to go for a midwife. The baby died aged only three months, and Dostoevsky blamed himself for the loss.

Dostoevsky&#x27;s notebooks of 1867 reveal deep uncertainty as to the direction he was taking with the novel. Detailed plot outlines and character sketches were made, but were quickly abandoned and replaced with new ones. In one early draft, the character who was to become Prince Myshkin is an evil man who commits a series of terrible crimes, including the rape of his adopted sister (Nastasya Filippovna), and who only arrives at goodness by way of his conversion through Christ. By the end of the year, however, a new premise had been firmly adopted. In a letter to Apollon Maykov, Dostoevsky explained that his own desperate circumstances had &quot;forced&quot; him to seize on an idea that he had considered for some time but had been afraid of, feeling himself to be artistically unready for it. This was the idea to &quot;depict a completely beautiful human being&quot;. Rather than bring a man to goodness, he wanted to start with a man who was already a truly Christian soul, someone who is essentially innocent and deeply compassionate, and test him against the psychological, social and political complexities of the modern Russian world. It was not only a matter of how the good man responded to that world, but of how it responded to him. Devising a series of scandalous scenes, he would &quot;examine each character&#x27;s emotions and record what each would do in response to Myshkin and to the other characters.&quot; The difficulty with this approach was that he himself did not know in advance how the characters were going to respond, and thus he was unable to pre-plan the plot or structure of the novel. Nonetheless, in January 1868 the first chapters of &quot;The Idiot&quot; were sent off to &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot;.

==Plot==
===Part 1===
Prince Myshkin, a young man in his mid-twenties and a descendant of one of the oldest Russian lines of nobility, is on a train to Saint Petersburg on a cold November morning. He is returning to Russia having spent the past four years in a Swiss clinic for treatment of a severe epileptic condition. On the journey, Myshkin meets a young man of the merchant class, Parfyon Semyonovich Rogozhin, and is struck by his passionate intensity, particularly in relation to a woman—the dazzling society beauty Nastasya Filippovna Barashkova—with whom he is obsessed. Rogozhin has just inherited a very large fortune due to the death of his father, and he intends to use it to pursue the object of his desire. Joining in their conversation is a civil servant named Lebedyev—a man with a profound knowledge of social trivia and gossip. Realizing who Rogozhin is, Lebedyev firmly attaches himself to him.

The purpose of Myshkin&#x27;s trip is to make the acquaintance of his distant relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna, and to make inquiries about a matter of business. Lizaveta Prokofyevna is the wife of General Epanchin, a wealthy and respected man in his mid-fifties. When the Prince calls on them he meets Gavril Ardalionovich Ivolgin (Ganya), the General&#x27;s assistant. The General and his business partner, the aristocrat Totsky, are seeking to arrange a marriage between Ganya and Nastasya Filippovna. Totsky had been the orphaned Nastasya Filippovna&#x27;s childhood guardian, but he had taken advantage of his position to groom her for his own sexual gratification. As a grown woman, Nastasya Filippovna has developed an incisive and merciless insight into their relationship. Totsky, thinking the marriage might settle her and free him to pursue his desire for marriage with General Epanchin&#x27;s eldest daughter, has promised 75,000 rubles. Nastasya Filippovna, suspicious of Ganya and aware that his family does not approve of her, has reserved her decision, but has promised to announce it that evening at her birthday soirée. Ganya and the General openly discuss the subject in front of Myshkin. Ganya shows him a photograph of her, and he is particularly struck by the dark beauty of her face.

Myshkin makes the acquaintance of Lizaveta Prokofyevna and her three daughters—Alexandra, Adelaida and Aglaya. They are all very curious about him and not shy about expressing their opinion, particularly Aglaya. He readily engages with them and speaks with remarkable candor on a wide variety of subjects—his illness, his impressions of Switzerland, art, philosophy, love, death, the brevity of life, capital punishment, and donkeys. In response to their request that he speak of the time he was in love, he tells a long anecdote from his time in Switzerland about a downtrodden woman—Marie—whom he befriended, along with a group of children, when she was unjustly ostracized and morally condemned. The Prince ends by describing what he divines about each of their characters from studying their faces and surprises them by saying that Aglaya is almost as beautiful as Nastasya Filippovna.

The prince rents a room in the Ivolgin apartment, occupied by Ganya&#x27;s family and another lodger called Ferdyschenko. There is much angst within Ganya&#x27;s family about the proposed marriage, which is regarded, particularly by his mother and sister (Varya), as shameful. Just as a quarrel on the subject is reaching a peak of tension, Nastasya Filippovna herself arrives to pay a visit to her potential new family. Shocked and embarrassed, Ganya succeeds in introducing her, but when she bursts into a prolonged fit of laughter at the look on his face, his expression transforms into one of murderous hatred. The Prince intervenes to calm him down, and Ganya&#x27;s rage is diverted toward him in a violent gesture. The tension is not eased by the entrance of Ganya&#x27;s father, General Ivolgin, a drunkard with a tendency to tell elaborate lies. Nastasya Filippovna flirtatiously encourages the General and then mocks him. Ganya&#x27;s humiliation is compounded by the arrival of Rogozhin, accompanied by a rowdy crowd of drunks and rogues, Lebedyev among them. Rogozhin openly starts bidding for Nastasya Filippovna, ending with an offer of a hundred thousand rubles. With the scene assuming increasingly scandalous proportions, Varya angrily demands that someone remove the &quot;shameless woman&quot;. Ganya seizes his sister&#x27;s arm, and she responds, to Nastasya Filippovna&#x27;s delight, by spitting in his face. He is about to strike her when the Prince again intervenes, and Ganya slaps him violently in the face. Everyone is deeply shocked, including Nastasya Filippovna, and she struggles to maintain her mocking aloofness as the others seek to comfort the Prince. Myshkin admonishes her and tells her it is not who she really is. She apologizes to Ganya&#x27;s mother and leaves, telling Ganya to be sure to come to her birthday party that evening. Rogozhin and his retinue go off to raise the 100,000 rubles.

Among the guests at the party are Totsky, General Epanchin, Ganya, his friend Ptitsyn (Varya&#x27;s fiancé), and Ferdyshchenko, who, with Nastasya Filippovna&#x27;s approval, plays the role of cynical buffoon. With the help of Ganya&#x27;s younger brother Kolya, the Prince arrives, uninvited. To enliven the party, Ferdyshchenko suggests a game where everyone must recount the story of the worst thing they have ever done. Others are shocked at the proposal, but Nastasya Filippovna is enthusiastic. When it comes to Totsky&#x27;s turn he tells a long but innocuous anecdote from the distant past. Disgusted, Nastasya Filippovna turns to Myshkin and demands his advice on whether or not to marry Ganya. Myshkin advises her not to, and Nastasya Filippovna, to the dismay of Totsky, General Epanchin and Ganya, firmly announces that she is following this advice. At this point, Rogozhin and his followers arrive with the promised 100,000 rubles. Nastasya Filipovna is preparing to leave with him, exploiting the scandalous scene to humiliate Totsky, when Myshkin himself offers to marry her. He speaks gently and sincerely, and in response to incredulous queries about what they will live on, produces a document indicating that he will soon be receiving a large inheritance. Though surprised and deeply touched, Nastasya Filipovna, after throwing the 100,000 rubles in the fire and telling Ganya they are his if he wants to get them out, chooses to leave with Rogozhin. Myshkin follows them.

===Part 2===
For the next six months, Nastasya Filippovna remains unsettled and is torn between Myshkin and Rogozhin. Myshkin is tormented by her suffering, and Rogozhin is tormented by her love for Myshkin and her disdain for his own claims on her. Returning to Petersburg, the Prince visits Rogozhin&#x27;s house. Myshkin becomes increasingly horrified at Rogozhin&#x27;s attitude to her. Rogozhin confesses to beating her in a jealous rage and raises the possibility of cutting her throat. Despite the tension between them, they part as friends, with Rogozhin even making a gesture of concession. But the Prince remains troubled and for the next few hours he wanders the streets, immersed in intense contemplation. He suspects that Rogozhin is watching him and returns to his hotel where Rogozhin—who has been hiding in the stairway—attacks him with a knife. At the same moment, the Prince is struck down by a violent epileptic seizure, and Rogozhin flees in a panic.

Recovering, Myshkin joins Lebedyev (from whom he is renting a dacha) in the summer resort town Pavlovsk. He knows that Nastasya Filippovna is in Pavlovsk and that Lebedyev is aware of her movements and plans. The Epanchins, who are also in Pavlovsk, visit the Prince. They are joined by their friend Yevgeny Pavlovich Radomsky, a handsome and wealthy military officer with a particular interest in Aglaya. Aglaya, however, is more interested in the Prince, and to Myshkin&#x27;s embarrassment and everyone else&#x27;s amusement, she recites Pushkin&#x27;s poem &quot;The Poor Knight&quot; in a reference to his noble efforts to save Nastasya Filippovna.

The Epanchins&#x27; visit is rudely interrupted by the arrival of Burdovsky, a young man who claims to be the illegitimate son of Myshkin&#x27;s late benefactor, Pavlishchev. The inarticulate Burdovsky is supported by a group of insolent young men. These include the consumptive seventeen-year-old Ippolit Terentyev, the nihilist Doktorenko, and Keller, an ex-officer who, with the help of Lebedyev, has written an article vilifying the Prince and Pavlishchev. They demand money from Myshkin as a &quot;just&quot; reimbursement for Pavlishchev&#x27;s support, but their arrogant bravado is severely dented when Gavril Ardalionovich, who has been researching the matter on Myshkin&#x27;s behalf, proves conclusively that the claim is false and that Burdovsky has been deceived. The Prince tries to reconcile with the young men and offers financial support anyway. Disgusted, Lizaveta Prokofyevna loses all control and furiously attacks both parties. Ippolit laughs, and Lizaveta Prokofyevna seizes him by the arm, causing him to break into a prolonged fit of coughing. But he suddenly becomes calm, informs them all that he is near death, and politely requests that he be permitted to talk to them for a while. He awkwardly attempts to express his need for their love, eventually bringing both himself and Lizaveta Prokofyevna to the point of tears. But as the Prince and Lizaveta Prokofyevna discuss what to do with the invalid, another transformation occurs and Ippolit, after unleashing a torrent of abuse at the Prince, leaves with the other young men. The Epanchins also leave, both Lizaveta Prokofyevna and Aglaya deeply indignant with the Prince. Only Yevgeny Pavlovich remains in good spirits, and he smiles charmingly as he says good-bye. At that moment, a magnificent carriage pulls up at the dacha, and the ringing voice of Nastasya Filippovna calls out to Yevgeny Pavlovich. In a familiar tone, she tells him not to worry about all the IOUs as Rogozhin has bought them up. The carriage departs, leaving everyone, particularly Yevgeny Pavlovich and the Prince, in a state of shock. Yevgeny Pavlovich claims to know nothing about the debts, and Nastasya Filippovna&#x27;s motives become a subject of anxious speculation.

===Part 3===
Reconciling with Lizaveta Prokofyevna, the Prince visits the Epanchins at their dacha. He is beginning to fall in love with Aglaya, and she likewise appears to be fascinated by him, though she often mocks or angrily reproaches him for his naiveté and excessive humility. Myshkin joins Lizaveta Prokofyevna, her daughters and Yevgeny Pavlovich for a walk to the park to hear the music. While listening to the high-spirited conversation and watching Aglaya in a kind of daze, he notices Rogozhin and Nastasya Filippovna in the crowd. Nastasya Filippovna again addresses herself to Yevgeny Pavlovich, and in the same jolly tone as before loudly informs him that his uncle—a wealthy and respected old man from whom he is expecting a large inheritance—has shot himself and that a huge sum of government money is missing. Yevgeny Pavlovich stares at her in shock as Lizaveta Prokofyevna makes a hurried exit with her daughters. Nastasya Filippovna hears an officer friend of Yevgeny Pavlovich suggest that a whip is needed for women like her, and she responds by grabbing a riding-whip from a bystander and striking the officer across the face with it. He tries to attack her but Myshkin restrains him, for which he is violently pushed. Rogozhin, after making a mocking comment to the officer, leads Nastasya Filippovna away. The officer recovers his composure, addresses himself to Myshkin, politely confirms his name, and leaves.

Myshkin follows the Epanchins back to their dacha, where eventually Aglaya finds him alone on the verandah. To his surprise, she begins to talk to him very earnestly about duels and how to load a pistol. They are interrupted by General Epanchin who wants Myshkin to walk with him. Aglaya slips a note into Myshkin&#x27;s hand as they leave. The General is greatly agitated by the effect Nastasya Filippovna&#x27;s behavior is having on his family, particularly since her information about Yevgeny Pavlovich&#x27;s uncle has turned out to be completely correct. When the General leaves, Myshkin reads Aglaya&#x27;s note, which is an urgent request to meet her secretly the following morning. His reflections are interrupted by Keller who has come to offer to be his second at the duel that will inevitably follow from the incident that morning, but Myshkin merely laughs heartily and invites Keller to visit him to drink champagne. Keller departs and Rogozhin appears. He informs the Prince that Nastasya Filippovna wants to see him and that she has been in correspondence with Aglaya. She is convinced that the Prince is in love with Aglaya, and is seeking to bring them together. Myshkin is perturbed by the information, but he remains in an inexplicably happy frame of mind and speaks with forgiveness and brotherly affection to Rogozhin. Remembering it will be his birthday tomorrow, he persuades Rogozhin to join him for some wine.

They find that a large party has assembled at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyshchenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin&#x27;s surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev&#x27;s eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The essay is a painfully detailed description of the events and thoughts leading him to what he calls his &#x27;final conviction&#x27;: that suicide is the only possible way to affirm his will in the face of nature&#x27;s invincible laws, and that consequently he will be shooting himself at sunrise. The reading drags on for over an hour and by its end the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, are bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky, and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually he falls asleep and the party disperses.

The Prince wanders for some time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat appointed by Aglaya as their meeting place. Her laughter wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastasya Filippovna. They talk for a long time about the letters Aglaya has received, in which Nastasya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin. Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastasya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastasya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is not in love with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters back in her face, and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters with dread, and later that day Nastasya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her.

===Part 4===
It is clear to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Epanchin that their daughter is in love with the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastasya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents&#x27; respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin&#x27;s eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother&#x27;s priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.

For a while the dinner party proceeds smoothly. Inexperienced in the ways of the aristocracy, Myshkin is deeply impressed by the elegance and good humour of the company, unsuspicious of its superficiality. It turns out that one of those present—Ivan Petrovich—is a relative of his beloved benefactor Pavlishchev, and the Prince becomes extraordinarily enthusiastic. But when Ivan Petrovich mentions that Pavlishchev ended by giving up everything and going over to the Roman Catholic Church, Myshkin is horrified. He launches unexpectedly into an anti-Catholic tirade, claiming that it preaches the Antichrist and in its quest for political supremacy has given birth to Atheism. Everyone present is shocked and several attempts are made to stop or divert him, but he only becomes more animated. At the height of his fervor he begins waving his arms about and knocks over the priceless Chinese vase, smashing it to pieces. As Myshkin emerges from his profound astonishment, the general horror turns to amusement and concern for his health. But it is only temporary, and he soon begins another spontaneous discourse, this time on the subject of the aristocracy in Russia, once again becoming oblivious to all attempts to quell his ardour. The speech is only brought to an end by the onset of an epileptic seizure: Aglaya, deeply distressed, catches him in her arms as he falls. He is taken home, having left a decidedly negative impression on the guests.

The next day Ippolit visits the Prince to inform him that he and others (such as Lebedyev and Ganya) have been intriguing against him, and have been unsettling Aglaya with talk of Nastasya Filippovna. Ippolit has arranged, at Aglaya&#x27;s request and with Rogozhin&#x27;s help, a meeting between the two women. That evening Aglaya, having left her home in secret, calls for the Prince. They proceed in silence to the appointed meeting place, where both Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin are already present. It soon becomes apparent that Aglaya has not come there to discuss anything, but to chastise and humiliate Nastasya Filippovna, and a bitter exchange of accusations and insults ensues. Nastasya Filippovna orders Rogozhin to leave and hysterically demands of Myshkin that he stay with her. Myshkin, once again torn by her suffering, is unable to deny her and reproaches Aglaya for her attack. Aglaya looks at him with pain and hatred, and runs off. He goes after her but Nastasya Filippovna stops him desperately and then faints. Myshkin stays with her.

In accordance with Nastasya Filippovna&#x27;s wish, she and the Prince become engaged. Public opinion is highly critical of Myshkin&#x27;s actions toward Aglaya, and the Epanchins break off all relations with him. He tries to explain to Yevgeny Pavlovich that Nastasya Filippovna is a broken soul, that he must stay with her or she will probably die, and that Aglaya will understand if he is only allowed to talk to her. Yevgeny Pavlovich refuses to facilitate any contact between them and suspects that Myshkin himself is mad.

On the day of the wedding, a beautifully attired Nastasya Filippovna is met by Keller and Burdovsky, who are to escort her to the church where Myshkin is waiting. A large crowd has gathered, among whom is Rogozhin. Seeing him, Nastasya Filippovna rushes to him and tells him hysterically to take her away, which Rogozhin loses no time in doing. The Prince, though shaken, is not particularly surprised at this development. For the remainder of the day he calmly fulfills his social obligations to guests and members of the public. The following morning he takes the first train to Petersburg and goes to Rogozhin&#x27;s house, but he is told by servants that there is no one there. After several hours of fruitless searching, he returns to the hotel he was staying at when he last encountered Rogozhin in Petersburg. Rogozhin appears and asks him to come back to the house. They enter the house in secret and Rogozhin leads him to the dead body of Nastasya Filippovna: he has stabbed her through the heart. The two men keep vigil over the body, which Rogozhin has laid out in his study.

Rogozhin is sentenced to fifteen years hard labor in Siberia. Myshkin goes mad and, through the efforts of Yevgeny Pavlovich, returns to the sanatorium in Switzerland. The Epanchins go abroad and Aglaya elopes with a wealthy, exiled Polish count who later is discovered to be neither wealthy, nor a count, nor an exile—at least, not a political exile—and who, along with a Roman Catholic priest, has turned her against her family.

== Characters ==
===Major characters===
:&quot;(For further discussion of the major characters see Prince Myshkin)&quot;

Prince Myshkin, the novel&#x27;s central character, is a young man who has returned to Russia after a long period abroad where he was receiving treatment for epilepsy. The lingering effects of the illness, combined with his innocence and lack of social experience, sometimes create the superficial and completely false impression of mental or psychological deficiency. Most of the other characters at one time or another refer to him disparagingly as an &#x27;idiot&#x27;, but nearly all of them are deeply affected by him. In truth he is highly intelligent, self-aware, intuitive, and empathic. He is someone who has thought deeply about human nature, morality and spirituality, and is capable of expressing those thoughts with great clarity.

Nastasya Filippovna, the main female protagonist, is darkly beautiful, intelligent, fierce, and mocking. She is an intimidating figure to most of the other characters. Of noble birth but orphaned at age 7, she was manipulated into a position of sexual servitude by her guardian, the voluptuary Totsky. Her broken innocence and the social perception of disgrace produce an intensely emotional and destructive personality. The Prince is deeply moved by her beauty and her suffering, and despite feeling that she is insane, remains devoted to her. She is torn between Myshkin&#x27;s compassion and Rogozhin&#x27;s obsession with her.

Rogózhin (Parfyón Semyónovich), who has just inherited a huge fortune from his merchant father, is madly in love with Nastasya Filippovna, and recklessly abandons himself to pursuing her. He instinctively likes and trusts the Prince when they first meet, but later develops a hatred for him out of jealousy. The character represents passionate, instinctive love, as opposed to Myshkin&#x27;s Christian love based in compassion.

Agláya Ivánovna is the radiantly beautiful youngest daughter of Myshkin&#x27;s distant relative Lizaveta Prokofyevna and her husband, the wealthy and respected General Epanchin. Aglaya is proud, commanding, and impatient, but also full of arch humour, laughter, and innocence. The Prince is particularly drawn to her after the darkness of his time with Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin.

Ippolít Teréntyev is a young nihilist intellectual who is in the final stages of tuberculosis and near death. Still full of youthful idealism, he craves love and recognition from others, but their indifference and his own morbid self-obsession lead him to increasing extremes of cynicism and defiance. The character is a &#x27;quasi-double&#x27; for Myshkin: their circumstances force them to address the same metaphysical questions, but their responses are diametrically opposed.

===Other characters===
*Gánya (Gavríl Ardaliónovich) – a capable but extremely vain and avaricious young man, he offers himself in marriage to Nastasya Filippovna, whom he secretly hates, on the promise of riches from Totsky, but she rejects and humiliates him. He also tries to compete with Myshkin for Aglaya&#x27;s affections. A mediocre man who is resentful of his own lack of originality, Ganya represents love from vanity, and is contrasted with Myshkin and Rogozhin.
*Lébedyev (Lukyán Timoféevich) – a roguish drunkard whose restless curiosity and petty ambition have made him into a kind of repository of social information. He uses this to ingratiate himself with superiors, and to pursue various schemes and intrigues. His unpleasant tendencies are offset to some extent by a mischievous sense of humour, a sharp intellect, and occasional bouts of abject self-condemnation and compassion for others.
*Lizavéta Prokófyevna – Aglaya&#x27;s mother and Myshkin&#x27;s distant relative. Though child-like in the spontaneity of her emotions, she is strong-willed and imperious, particularly about matters of honour and morality. Myshkin considers her and Aglaya to be very alike.
*General Iván Fyódorovich Epanchín – Aglaya&#x27;s father.
*Alexándra Ivánovna – Aglaya&#x27;s sister, eldest daughter of Ivan Fyodorovich and Lizaveta Prokofyevna.
*Adelaída Ivánovna – Aglaya&#x27;s sister, second daughter of Ivan Fyodorovich and Lizaveta Prokofyevna. 
*Prince Shch. (or Prince S) – a &#x27;liberal&#x27; aristocrat who marries Adelaida Ivanovna.
*Yevgény Pávlovich Radómsky – a handsome military officer who is a close friend of the Epanchins. His rumoured interest in Aglaya leads Nastasya Filippovna (who wants to bring Aglaya and the Prince together) to publicly expose some unsavoury aspects of his background. Despite this, he and the Prince become friends and have a mutual respect for each other&#x27;s intelligence.
*Afanásy Ivánovich Tótsky – a wealthy aristocrat and libertine, a friend and business associate of General Epanchin. He is the former guardian of Nastasya Filippovna.
*General Ívolgin (Ardalión Alexándrovich) – Ganya&#x27;s father, a highly honourable man, but a drunkard and mythomaniac. He is the subject of a subplot in Part 4, involving the theft of 400 rubles from Lebedyev.
*Nína Alexándrovna – General Ivolgin&#x27;s long-suffering wife, and mother of Ganya, Varya and Kolya.
*Kólya (Nikolay Ardaliónovich) – Ganya&#x27;s younger brother. He is a friend of Ippolit&#x27;s, and also becomes a friend and confidant of the Prince.
*Várya (Varvára Ardaliónovna) – Ganya&#x27;s sister.
*Iván Petróvich Ptítsyn – Ganya&#x27;s friend and Varya&#x27;s husband.
*Ferdýshchenko – a lodger with the Ivolgins, a drunkard whose inappropriate manner and coarse but cutting wit is valued by Nastasya Filippovna.
*Antíp Burdóvsky – a young man who mistakenly thinks he is the illegitimate son of Myshkin&#x27;s benefactor Pavlishchev. He begins by aggressively demanding money from the Prince, but later becomes an admirer.
*Kéller – a retired Lieutenant, initially one of Rogozhin&#x27;s crew, he becomes an associate of Ippolit and Burdovsky and writes a slanderous article about the Prince. He later develops a great admiration for the Prince and seeks to defend him.
*Doktorenko – Lebedyev&#x27;s nephew, a nihilist who, along with Ippolit, leads Burdovsky&#x27;s attack on the Prince.
*Véra Lukyánovna – Lebedyev&#x27;s daughter.

==Themes==
===Atheism and Christianity in Russia===
A dialogue between the intimately related themes of atheism and Christian faith (meaning, for Dostoevsky, Russian Orthodoxy) pervades the entire novel. Dostoevsky&#x27;s personal image of Christian faith, formed prior to his philosophical engagement with Orthodoxy but never abandoned, was one that emphasized the human need for belief in the immortality of the soul, and identified Christ with ideals of &quot;beauty, truth, brotherhood and Russia&quot;. The character of Prince Myshkin was originally intended to be an embodiment of this &quot;lofty (Russian) Christian idea&quot;. With the character&#x27;s immersion in the increasingly materialistic and atheistic world of late 19th century Russia, the idea is constantly being elaborated, tested in every scene and against every other character. However, Myshkin&#x27;s Christianity is not a doctrine or a set of beliefs but is something that he lives spontaneously in his relations with all others. Whenever he appears &quot;hierarchical barriers between people suddenly become penetrable, an inner contact is formed between them... His personality possesses the peculiar capacity to relativize everything that disunifies people and imparts a &quot;false seriousness&quot; to life.&quot;

The young nihilist Ippolit Terentyev is the character that provides the most coherent articulation of the atheist challenge to Myshkin&#x27;s worldview, most notably in the long essay &#x27;An Essential Explanation&#x27; which he reads to the gathering at the Prince&#x27;s birthday celebration in part 3 of the novel. Here he picks up a motif first touched upon early in part 2, in a dialogue between Myshkin and Rogozhin, when they are contemplating the copy of Holbein&#x27;s &quot;Dead Christ&quot; in Rogozhin&#x27;s house, and Rogozhin confesses that the painting is eroding his faith. Holbein&#x27;s painting held a particular significance for Dostoevsky because he saw in it his own impulse &quot;to confront Christian faith with everything that negated it&quot;. The character of Ippolit argues that the painting, which depicts with unflinching realism the tortured, already putrefying corpse of Christ within the tomb, represents the triumph of blind nature over the vision of immortality in God that Christ&#x27;s existence on Earth signified. He is unable to share Myshkin&#x27;s intuition of the harmonious unity of all Being, an intuition evoked most intensely earlier in the novel in a description of the pre-epileptic aura. Consequently, the inexorable laws of nature appear to Ippolit as something monstrous, particularly in the light of his own approaching death from tuberculosis: &quot;It is as though this painting were the means by which this idea of a dark, brazen and senseless eternal force, to which everything is subordinate, is expressed... I remember someone taking me by the arm, a candle in his hands, and showing me some sort of enormous and repulsive tarantula, assuring me that this was that same dark, blind and all-powerful creature, and laughing at my indignation.&quot;The Prince does not directly engage with Ippolit&#x27;s atheistic arguments, as a religious ideologist might: rather, he recognizes Ippolit as a kindred spirit, and empathetically perceives his youthful struggle with both his own inner negation and the cruelty, irony, and indifference of the world around him.

====Catholicism====
The Prince&#x27;s Christianity, insofar as he is the embodiment of the &#x27;Russian Christian idea&#x27;, explicitly excludes Roman Catholicism. His unexpected tirade at the Epanchins&#x27; dinner party is based in unequivocal assertions that Roman Catholicism is &quot;an unChristian faith&quot;, that it preaches the Antichrist, and that its appropriation and distortion of Christ&#x27;s teaching into a basis for the attainment of political supremacy has given birth to atheism. The Roman Catholic Church, he claims, is merely a continuation of the Western Roman Empire: cynically exploiting the person and teaching of Christ it has installed itself on the earthly throne and taken up the sword to entrench and expand its power. This is a betrayal of the true teaching of Christ, a teaching that transcends the lust for earthly power (Satan&#x27;s third temptation to Christ), and speaks directly to the individual&#x27;s and the people&#x27;s highest emotions—those that spring from what Myshkin calls &quot;spiritual thirst&quot;. Atheism and socialism are a reaction, born of profound disillusionment, to the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s defilement of its own moral and spiritual authority.

It is because of this &quot;spiritual thirst&quot; that Myshkin is so uncompromisingly scathing about the influence of Roman Catholicism and atheism in Russia. The Russian, he claims, not only feels this thirst with great urgency, but is, by virtue of it, particularly susceptible to false faiths:&quot;In our country if a man goes over to Catholicism, he unfailingly becomes a Jesuit, and one of the most clandestine sort, at that; if he becomes an atheist, he will at once begin to demand the eradication of belief in God by coercion, that is, by the sword... It is not from vanity alone, not from mere sordid vain emotions that Russian atheists and Russian Jesuits proceed, but from a spiritual pain, a spiritual thirst, a yearning for something more exalted, for a firm shore, a motherland in which they have ceased to believe...&quot;

The theme of the maleficent influence of Catholicism on the Russian soul is expressed, in a less obvious and polemical way, through the character of Aglaya Epanchin. Passionate and idealistic, like &#x27;the Russian&#x27; alluded to in the anti-Catholic diatribe, Aglaya struggles with the ennui of middle class mediocrity and hates the moral vacuity of the aristocracy to whom her parents kowtow. Her &#x27;yearning for the exalted&#x27; has attracted her to militant Catholicism, and in the Prince&#x27;s devotion to Nastasya Filippovna she sees the heroism of a Crusader-Knight abandoning everything to go in to battle for his Christian ideal. She is deeply angry when, instead of &quot;defending himself triumphantly&quot; against his enemies (Ippolit and his nihilist friends), he tries to make peace with them and offers assistance. Aglaya&#x27;s tendency to misinterpret Myshkin&#x27;s motives leads to fractures in what is otherwise a blossoming of innocent love. When the Epanchins go abroad after the final catastrophe, Aglaya, under the influence of a Roman Catholic priest, abandons her family and elopes with a Polish &#x27;Count&#x27;.

===Innocence and guilt===
In his notes Dostoevsky distinguishes the Prince from other characters of the virtuous type in fiction (such as Don Quixote and Pickwick) by emphasizing innocence rather than comicality. In one sense Myshkin&#x27;s innocence is an instrument of satire since it brings in to sharp relief the corruption and egocentricity of those around him. But his innocence is serious rather than comical, and he has a deeper insight into the psychology of human beings in general by assuming its presence in everyone else, even as they laugh at him, or try to deceive and exploit him. Examples of this combination of innocence and insight can be found in Myshkin&#x27;s interactions with virtually all the other characters. He explains it himself in an episode with the roguish but &#x27;honourable&#x27; Keller, who has confessed that he has sought the Prince out for motives that are simultaneously noble (he wants spiritual guidance) and mercenary (he wants to borrow a large sum of money from him). The Prince guesses that he has come to borrow money before he has even mentioned it, and unassumingly engages him in a conversation about the psychological oddity of &#x27;double thoughts&#x27;:Two thoughts coincided, that very often happens... I think it&#x27;s a bad thing and, you know, Keller, I reproach myself most of all for it. What you told me just now could have been about me. I&#x27;ve even sometimes thought that all human beings are like that, because it&#x27;s terribly difficult to fight those &quot;double thoughts&quot;... At any rate, I am not your judge... You used cunning to coax money out of me by means of tears, but you yourself swear that your confession had a different aim, a noble one; as for the money, you need it to go on a drinking spree, don&#x27;t you? And after such a confession that&#x27;s weakness of course. But how can one give up drinking sprees in a single moment? It&#x27;s impossible. So what is to be done? It is best to leave it to your own conscience, what do you think?

Aglaya Ivanovna, despite her occasional fury at his apparent passivity, understands this aspect of Myshkin&#x27;s innocence, and expresses it in their conversation at the green seat when she speaks of the &quot;two parts of the mind: one that&#x27;s important and one that&#x27;s not important&quot;.

Nastasya Filippovna is a character who embodies the internal struggle between innocence and guilt. Isolated and sexually exploited by Totsky from the age of sixteen, Nastasya Filippovna has inwardly embraced her social stigmatization as a corrupted &#x27;fallen woman&#x27;, but this conviction is intimately bound to its opposite—the victimized child&#x27;s sense of a broken innocence that longs for vindication. The combination produces a cynical and destructive outer persona, which disguises a fragile and deeply hurt inner being. When the Prince speaks to her, he addresses only this inner being, and in him she sees and hears the long dreamt-of affirmation of her innocence. But the self-destructive voice of her guilt, so intimately bound to the longing for innocence, does not disappear as a result, and constantly reasserts itself. Myshkin divines that in her constant reiteration of her shame there is a &quot;dreadful, unnatural pleasure, as if it were a revenge on someone.&quot; Its principal outward form is the repeated choice to submit herself to Rogozhin&#x27;s obsession with her, knowing that its end result will almost certainly be her own death.

The theme of the intrapsychic struggle between innocence and guilt is manifested, in idiosyncratic forms, in many of the characters in the novel. The character of General Ivolgin, for example, constantly tells outrageous lies, but to those who understand him (such as Myshkin, Lebedyev, and Kolya) he is the noblest and most honest of men. He commits a theft out of weakness, but is so overcome by shame that it helps precipitate a stroke. Lebedyev is constantly plotting and swindling, but he is also deeply religious, and is periodically overcome by paroxysms of guilt-ridden self-loathing. Myshkin himself has a strong tendency to feel ashamed of his own thoughts and actions. The fact that Rogozhin reaches the point of attacking him with a knife is something for which he feels himself to be equally guilty because his own half-conscious suspicions were the same as Rogozhin&#x27;s half-conscious impulse. When Burdovsky, who has unceremoniously demanded money from him on the basis of a falsehood, gets increasingly insulted by his attempts to offer assistance, Myshkin reproaches himself for his own clumsiness and lack of tact.

===Autobiographical themes===
====Capital punishment====
In 1849, Dostoevsky was sentenced to execution by firing squad for his part in the activities of the Petrashevsky Circle. Shortly after the period of interrogation and trial, he and his fellow prisoners were taken, without warning, to Semyonovsky Square where the sentence of death was read out over them. The first three prisoners were tied to stakes facing the firing squad: Dostoevsky was among the next in line. Just as the first shots were about to be fired, a message arrived from the Tsar commuting the sentences to hard labor in Siberia.

The experience had a profound effect on Dostoevsky, and in Part 1 of &quot;The Idiot&quot; (written twenty years after the event) the character of Prince Myshkin repeatedly speaks in depth on the subject of capital punishment. On one occasion, conversing with the Epanchin women, he recounts an anecdote that exactly mirrors Dostoevsky&#x27;s own experience. A man of 27, who had committed a political offence, was taken to the scaffold with his comrades, where a death sentence by firing squad was read out to them. Twenty minutes later, with all the preparations for the execution having been completed, they were unexpectedly reprieved, but for those twenty minutes the man lived with the complete certainty that he was soon to face sudden death. According to this man, the mind recoils so powerfully against the reality of its imminent death that the experience of time itself is radically altered. The mind speeds up exponentially as the moment approaches, causing time to expand correspondingly, even reaching the point where the tiny amount of conventional human time left is experienced inwardly as unbearable in its enormity. Eventually, the man said, he &quot;longed to be shot quickly&quot;.

The subject of capital punishment first comes up earlier in Part 1, when the Prince is waiting with a servant for General Epanchin to appear. Engaging the servant in conversation, the Prince tells the harrowing story of an execution by guillotine that he recently witnessed in France. He concludes the description with his own reflections on the horror of death by execution:... the worst, most violent pain lies not in injuries, but in the fact that you know for certain that within the space of an hour, then ten minutes, then half a minute, then now, right at this moment—your soul will fly out of your body, and you&#x27;ll no longer be a human being, and that this is certain; the main thing is that it is &quot;certain&quot;. When you put your head right under the guillotine and hear it sliding above your head, it&#x27;s that quarter of a second that&#x27;s most terrible of all... Who can say that human nature is able to endure such a thing without going mad? Why such mockery—ugly, superfluous, futile? Perhaps the man exists to whom his sentence has been read out, has been allowed to suffer, and then been told: &quot;off you go, you&#x27;ve been pardoned&quot;. A man like that could tell us perhaps. Such suffering and terror were what Christ spoke of. No, a human being should not be treated like that!
Later, when he is conversing with the Epanchin sisters, the Prince suggests to Adelaida, who has asked him for a subject to paint, that she paint the face of a condemned man a minute before the guillotine falls. He carefully explains his reasons for the suggestion, enters in to the emotions and thoughts of the condemned man, and describes in meticulous detail what the painting should depict. In this description Myshkin takes the contemplation of the condemned man&#x27;s inward experience of time a step further and asks: what would the mind be experiencing in the last tenth of a second, as it hears the iron blade sliding above? And what would be experienced if, as some argue, the mind continues for some time &quot;after&quot; the head has been cut off? The Prince breaks off without answering, but the implication is that the victim experiences these &#x27;moments&#x27; of unspeakable terror as vast stretches of time.

In part 2, the usually comical character of Lebedyev also considers the horror of the moment before execution. In the midst of a heated exchange with his nihilist nephew he expresses deep compassion for the soul of the Countess du Barry, who died in terror on the guillotine after pleading for her life with the executioner.

====Epilepsy====
For much of his adult life Dostoevsky suffered from an unusual and at times extremely debilitating form of temporal lobe epilepsy. In 1867 (the same year he began work on &quot;The Idiot&quot;) he wrote to his doctor: &quot;this epilepsy will end up by carrying me off... My memory has grown completely dim. I don&#x27;t recognize people anymore... I&#x27;m afraid of going mad or falling into idiocy&quot;. Dostoevsky&#x27;s attacks were preceded by a brief period of intense joyous mystical experience which he described as being worth years of his life, or perhaps even his whole life. A similar illness plays an important part in the characterization of Prince Myshkin, partly because the severity of the condition and its after-effects (disorientation, amnesia, aphasia, among others) contributes significantly to the myth of the character&#x27;s &#x27;idiocy&#x27;.

Although Myshkin himself is completely aware that he is not an &#x27;idiot&#x27; in any pejorative sense, he sometimes concedes the aptness of the word in relation to his mental state during particularly severe attacks. He occasionally makes reference to the pre-narrative period prior to his confinement in a Swiss sanatorium, when the symptoms were chronic and he really was &quot;almost an idiot&quot;. Paradoxically, it is also clear that aspects of the disease are intimately connected to a profound &quot;intensification&quot; of his mental faculties, and are a significant cause of the development of his higher spiritual preoccupations:...there was a certain stage almost immediately before the fit itself when, amidst the sadness, the mental darkness, the pressure, his brain suddenly seemed to burst into flame, and with an extraordinary jolt all his vital forces seemed to be tensed together. The sensation of life and of self-awareness increased tenfold at those moments... The mind, the heart were flooded with an extraordinary light; all his unrest, all his doubts, all his anxieties were resolved into a kind of higher calm, full of a serene, harmonious joy and hope. Although for Myshkin these moments represented an intimation of the highest truth, he also knew that &quot;stupefaction, mental darkness, idiocy stood before him as the consequence of these &#x27;highest moments&#x27;.&quot; At the end of the novel, after Rogozhin has murdered Nastasya Filippovna, the Prince appears to descend completely into this darkness.

===Mortality===
The consciousness of the inevitability of death and the effect that this consciousness has on the living soul is a recurring theme in the novel. A number of characters are shaped, each according to the nature of their own self-consciousness, by their proximity to death. Most notable in this respect are Prince Myshkin, Ippolit, Nastasya Filippovna and Rogozhin.

The anecdote of the man reprieved from execution is an illustration, drawn from the author&#x27;s own experience, of the extraordinary value of life as revealed in the moment of imminent death. The most terrible realization for the condemned man, according to Myshkin, is that of a wasted life, and he is consumed by the desperate desire for another chance. After his reprieve, the man vows to live every moment of life conscious of its infinite value (although he confesses to failing to fulfil the vow). Through his own emergence from a prolonged period on the brink of derangement, unconsciousness and death, the Prince himself has awoken to the joyous wonder of life, and all his words, moral choices and relations with others are guided by this fundamental insight. Joseph Frank, drawing on the theology of Albert Schweitzer, places the Prince&#x27;s insight in the context of &quot;the eschatological tension that is the soul of the primitive Christian ethic, whose doctrine of &quot;Agape&quot; was conceived in the same perspective of the imminent end of time.&quot; Myshkin asserts that in the ecstatic moment of the pre-epileptic aura he is able to comprehend the extraordinary phrase (from the Book of Revelation, 10:6): &quot;there shall be time no longer&quot;.

Like Myshkin, Ippolit is haunted by death and has a similar reverence for the beauty and mystery of life, but his self-absorbed atheist-nihilist worldview pushes him toward opposite conclusions. While the Prince&#x27;s worldview reflects the birth of his faith in a higher world-harmony, Ippolit&#x27;s concern with death develops into a metaphysical resentment of nature&#x27;s omnipotence, her utter indifference to human suffering in general and to his own suffering in particular. In the character of Ippolit, Dostoevsky again considers the terrible dilemma of the condemned man. Ippolit speaks of his illness as a &quot;death sentence&quot; and of himself as &quot;a man condemned to death&quot;. In his &#x27;Essential Explanation&#x27; he argues passionately that meaningful action is impossible when one knows one is going to die. The living soul absolutely requires that its future be open, not pre-determined, and it rebels irrepressibly against the imposition of a definite end. Ippolit conceives the idea of suicide as the only way left to him of asserting his will in the face of nature&#x27;s death sentence.

==Style==
===Temporality===
Dostoevsky&#x27;s notebooks for &quot;The Idiot&quot; during the time of its serial publication clearly indicate that he never knew what successive installments would contain. The method of testing the central idea in a series of extreme situations, allowing each character to freely respond, meant that there could be no pre-determined development of either plot or character: the author himself was just as surprised as the characters at what happened or didn&#x27;t happen. This uncontrived approach to writing becomes, in the novel, a depiction of what Morson calls &quot;the openness of time&quot;. In the usual novel, the apparently free acts of the characters are an illusion as they only serve to bring about a future that has been contrived by the author. But in real life, even with a belief in determinism or preordination, the subject always assumes its freedom and acts as though the future were unwritten. Dostoevsky&#x27;s extemporaneous approach helped facilitate the representation of the actual position of human subjectivity, as an open field of possibility where the will is free at all times, despite the apparent necessity of cause and effect. According to Mikhail Bakhtin, &quot;Dostoevsky always represents a person &quot;on the threshold&quot; of a final decision, at a moment of &quot;crisis&quot;, at an unfinalizable—and &quot;unpredeterminable&quot;—turning point for their soul.&quot;

===Carnivalization===
Bakhtin argues that Dostoevsky always wrote in opposition to modern tendencies toward the &quot;&quot;reification&quot; of man&quot;—the turning of human beings into objects (scientific, economic, social, etc.), enclosing them in an alien web of definition and causation, robbing them of freedom and responsibility. &#x27;Carnivalization&#x27; is a term used by Bakhtin to describe the techniques Dostoevsky uses to disarm this increasingly ubiquitous enemy and make true intersubjective dialogue possible. The concept suggests an ethos where normal hierarchies, social roles, proper behaviors and assumed truths are subverted in favor of the &quot;joyful relativity&quot; of free participation in the festival. In &quot;The Idiot&quot;, everything revolves around the two central carnival figures of the &quot;idiot&quot; and the &quot;madwoman&quot;, and consequently &quot;all of life is carnivalized, turned into a &#x27;world inside out&#x27;: traditional plot situations radically change their meaning, there develops a dynamic, carnivalistic play of sharp contrasts, unexpected shifts and changes&quot;. Prince Myshkin and Nastasya Filippovna are characters that inherently elude conventional social definition, or—as Bakhtin puts it—anything that might limit their &quot;pure humanness&quot;. The carnival atmosphere that develops around them in each situation and dialogue (&quot;bright and joyous&quot; in Myshkin&#x27;s case, &quot;dark and infernal&quot; in Nastasya Filippovna&#x27;s) allows Dostoevsky to &quot;expose a different side of life to himself and to the reader, to spy upon and depict in that life certain new, unknown depths and possibilities.&quot;

===Polyphony===
Carnivalization helps generate the artistic phenomenon that Bakhtin felt was unique to Dostoevsky in literature: Polyphony. Analogous to musical polyphony, literary polyphony is the simultaneous presence of multiple independent voices, each with its own truth and validity, but always coincident with other voices, affecting them and being affected by them. Bakhtin defines it as &quot;the event of interaction between autonomous and internally unfinalized consciousnesses&quot;. In the polyphonic novel each character&#x27;s voice speaks for itself: the narrator and even the author are present in the narrative merely as one voice among others. No voice has a privileged authority, and all have a form that inherently expresses engagement with other voices. Thus events unfold &quot;dialogically&quot;, as a consequence of the interaction between discrete voices, not as a consequence of authorial design:What unfolds... is not a multitude of characters and fates in a single objective world, illuminated by a single authorial consciousness; rather a &quot;plurality of consciousnesses, with equal rights and each with its own world&quot;, combine but are not merged in the unity of the event. Dostoevsky&#x27;s major heroes are, by the very nature of his creative design, &quot;not only objects of authorial discourse but also subjects of their own directly signifying discourse&quot;.
===Narrator and author===
Despite the appearance of omniscience, the narrator of &quot;The Idiot&quot; is given a distinct voice like any other character, and often conveys only a partial understanding of the events he is describing. It is the voice of a highly perceptive and meticulous &quot;reporter of the facts&quot;, who has, despite this objectivity, a particular perspective on what he is reporting, occasionally even lapsing into pontification. At one point in his notes Dostoevsky admonishes himself to &quot;write more concisely: only the facts. Write in the sense of &quot;people say&quot;...&quot; The narrator&#x27;s resort to &#x27;the facts&#x27; has the effect of &quot;placing the facts on the side of rumor and mystery rather than on the side of description and explanation.&quot; The narrator is thus not omniscient, but a particular kind of insightful but limited spectator, and in the end he openly admits to the reader that the Prince&#x27;s behaviour is inexplicable to him. According to Frank, &quot;this limitation of the narrator is part of Dostoevsky&#x27;s effort to present Myshkin&#x27;s behaviour as transcending &quot;all&quot; the categories of worldly moral-social experience.&quot;

For Bakhtin the narrator&#x27;s voice is another participant, albeit of a special kind, in the &quot;great dialogue&quot; that constitutes the Dostoevsky novel. All voices, all ideas, once they enter the world of the novel, take on an imaginary form that positions them in dialogical relationship with the other voices and ideas. In this sense, even the author&#x27;s own ideological positions, when they are expressed through the narrator, or Myshkin, or Lebedyev, &quot;become thoroughly dialogized and enter the great dialogue of the novel on &quot;completely equal terms&quot; with the other idea-images&quot;. Since the most important thing for Dostoevsky in the construction of his novels is the dialogic interaction of a multiplicity of voices, the author&#x27;s discourse &quot;cannot encompass the hero and his word on all sides, cannot lock in and finalize him from without. It can only address itself to him.&quot;

==Reception==
Critical reception of &quot;The Idiot&quot; at the time of its publication in Russia was almost uniformly negative. This was partly because a majority of the reviewers considered themselves to be opposed to Dostoevsky&#x27;s &#x27;conservatism&#x27;, and wished to discredit the book&#x27;s supposed political intentions. However the chief criticism, among both reviewers and general readers, was in the &quot;fantasticality&quot; of the characters. The radical critic D.I. Minaev wrote: &quot;People meet, fall in love, slap each other&#x27;s face—and all at the author&#x27;s first whim, without any artistic truth.&quot; V.P. Burenin, a liberal, described the novel&#x27;s presentation of the younger generation as &quot;the purest fruit of the writer&#x27;s subjective fancy&quot; and the novel as a whole as &quot;a belletristic compilation, concocted from a multitude of absurd personages and events, without any concern for any kind of artistic objectivity.&quot; Leading radical critic Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin approved of Dostoevsky&#x27;s attempt to depict the genuinely good man, but castigated him for his scurrilous treatment of &quot;the very people whose efforts are directed at the very objective apparently pursued by him... On the one hand there appear characters full of life and truth, but on the other, some kind of mysterious puppets hopping about as though in a dream...&quot; Dostoevsky responded to Maykov&#x27;s reports of the prevailing &#x27;fantastical&#x27; criticisms with an unashamed characterization of his literary philosophy as &quot;fantastic realism&quot;, and claimed that it was far more real, taking contemporary developments in Russia in to consideration, than the so-called realism of his detractors, and could even be used to predict future events.

French and English translations were published in 1887, and a German translation in 1889. European critical response was also largely negative, mainly due to the novel&#x27;s apparent formlessness and rambling style. Morson notes that critics saw it as &quot;a complete mess, as if it were written extemporaneously, with no overall structure in mind—as, in fact, it was.&quot; Typical of the western critics was the introduction to the first French translation which, while praising the energetic style and characterization, notes that &quot;they are enveloped in a fantastic mist and get lost in innumerable digressions.&quot;

Prominent modern critics acknowledge the novel&#x27;s apparent structural deficiencies, but also point out that the author was aware of them himself, and that they were perhaps a natural consequence of the experimental approach toward the central idea. Joseph Frank has called &quot;The Idiot&quot; &quot;perhaps the most original of Dostoevsky&#x27;s great novels, and certainly the most artistically uneven of them all,&quot; but he also wondered how it was that the novel &quot;triumphed so effortlessly over the inconsistencies and awkwardnesses of its structure.&quot; Gary Saul Morson observes that &quot;&quot;The Idiot&quot; brings to mind the old saw about how, according to the laws of physics, bumblebees should be unable to fly, but bumblebees, not knowing physics, go on flying anyway.&quot;

The twentieth century Russian literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin regarded the structural asymmetry and unpredictability of plot development, as well as the perceived &#x27;fantasticality&#x27; of the characters, not as any sort of deficiency, but as entirely consistent with Dostoevsky&#x27;s unique and groundbreaking literary method. Bakhtin saw Dostoevsky as the preeminent exemplar of the Carnivalesque in literature, and as the inventor of the polyphonic novel. A literary approach that incorporates carnivalisation and polyphony in Bakhtin&#x27;s sense precludes any sort of conventionally recognizable structure or predictable pattern of plot development.

== English translations ==
Since &quot;The Idiot&quot; was first published in Russian, there have been a number of translations into English, including those by:
* Frederick Whishaw (1887)
* Constance Garnett (1913)
** Revised by Anna Brailovsky (2003)
* Eva Martin (1915)
* David Magarshack (1955)
* John W. Strahan (1965)
* Henry Carlisle and Olga Andreyeva Carlisle (1980)
* Alan Myers (1992)
* Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky (2002)
* David McDuff (2004)
* Ignat Avsey (2010)

The Constance Garnett translation was for many years accepted as the definitive English translation, but more recently it has come under criticism for being dated. The Garnett translation, however, still remains widely available because it is now in the public domain. Some writers, such as Anna Brailovsky, have based their translations on Garnett&#x27;s. Since the 1990s, new English translations have appeared that have made the novel more accessible to English readers.
The &quot;Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation&quot; (2000) states that the Alan Myers version is the &quot;best version currently available&quot;. Since then, however, new translations by David McDuff and Pevear &amp; Volokhonsky have also been well received.

== Adaptations ==
* Several filmmakers have produced adaptations of the novel, among them &quot;Wandering Souls&quot; (Carl Froelich; 1921) &quot;L&#x27;idiot&quot; (Georges Lampin; 1946), a 1951 version by Akira Kurosawa, a 1958 version by Russian director Ivan Pyryev, and a 1992 Hindi version by Mani Kaul. An unfinished silent version by Sergei Eisenstein was once shown in the Soviet Union, the last reel &quot;lost&quot; over a disagreement with Joseph Stalin on the ending. Andrei Tarkovsky aspired to eventually produce a film adaptation of &quot;The Idiot&quot;, but was constantly obfuscated by Soviet state censors. He was contracted by Mosfilm to write a screenplay in 1983, but production halted after he announced his intent never to return to the Soviet Union. Tarkovsky&#x27;s other films, such as &quot;Stalker&quot;, incorporate many themes from &quot;The Idiot&quot;.
* In 1966, the British Broadcasting Corporation screened a five-part adaptation of &quot;The Idiot&quot; on BBC-2. It was directed by Alan Bridges and starred David Buck as Prince Myskin and Adrienne Corri as Nastasia.
* In 2003, Russian State Television Network VGTRK produced a 10-part, 8-hour mini-series of the work, directed by Vladimir Bortko for Telekanal Rossiya, which is available with English subtitles.
* BBC Radio 7 broadcast a 4-episode adaptation of &quot;The Idiot&quot; entitled &quot;Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s The Idiot&quot;, in June 2010. It starred Paul Rhys as Prince Myshkin.
* Mieczysław Weinberg adapted the novel into a Russian-language opera.
*John Eaton adapted the novel into a television opera, &quot;Myshkin&quot;, in 1974. It was produced by the Indiana University School of Music and WTIU.

<doc id="564177" wikidata="Q725874" url="?curid=564177" title="Tony Martin (American singer)">
<text>Alvin Morris (December 25, 1913 – July 27, 2012), known professionally as Tony Martin, was an American actor and popular singer.

His career spanned over seven decades, and he scored dozens of hits between the late-1930s and mid-1950s with songs such as &quot;Walk Hand in Hand&quot;, &quot;I Love Paris&quot;, &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot; and &quot;I Get Ideas&quot;. He was married to actress and dancer Cyd Charisse for 60 years, from 1948 until her death in 2008.

==Life and career==
Alvin Morris was born on December 25, 1913, in San Francisco, the son of Hattie (née Smith) and Edward Clarence Morris. His family was Jewish, and all of his grandparents had emigrated from Eastern Europe. He was raised in Oakland, California. At the age of ten, he received a saxophone as a gift from his grandmother. He went to Oakland High School and St Mary&#x27;s College.

In his grammar school glee club, he became an instrumentalist and singer, playing both saxophone and clarinet. He formed his first band, named &quot;The Red Peppers,&quot; when he was at Oakland Technical High School, eventually joining the band of a local orchestra leader, Tom Gerun, as a saxophone player sitting alongside the future bandleader Woody Herman. He attended Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California during the mid-1930s. After college, he left Gerun&#x27;s band to go to Hollywood to try films. It was at that time that he adopted the stage name of Tony Martin.

On radio, Martin sang and was master of ceremonies on &quot;Tune-Up Time&quot;, with Andre Kostelanetz, on CBS in the early 1940s. He had a television program on NBC in the mid-1950s. 

He was a featured vocalist on the George Burns and Gracie Allen radio program. On the show Allen playfully flirted with Tony, often threatening to fire him. Allen would say things like, &quot;Oh, Tony, you look so tired, why don&#x27;t you rest your lips on mine?&quot;

In films, Martin was first cast in a number of bit parts, including a role as a sailor in &quot;Follow the Fleet&quot; (1936), starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. He eventually signed with 20th Century-Fox and then Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in which he starred in a number of musicals. Between 1938 and 1942, he made a number of hit records for Decca. In 1941, Martin received equal billing with the Marx Brothers in their final film for MGM, &quot;The Big Store&quot;, in an effort to lure pop music fans and as an indication of MGM&#x27;s lack of interest in the comedy team. In the film he played a rising singer and performed &quot;Tenement Symphony,&quot; which was written by Hal Borne, who became his long-time musical director. Martin was the last surviving actor to co-star with the Marx Brothers.

Martin joined the United States Navy in 1942 as a chief specialist, the equivalent of a chief petty officer. He was dismissed from the service that year for &quot;unfitness&quot; after he testified at the court martial of a Naval procurement officer. He enlisted as a specialist after the officer twice failed to obtain a commission for him. Martin said that he had given the officer an auto worth $950 to &quot;facilitate&quot; his enlistment. At the time of his dismissal, the Navy said that removal for unfitness was not equivalent to a dishonorable discharge and &quot;does not carry degradation.&quot;

After leaving the Navy, Martin asked his local draft board for immediate induction into the service. He was drafted into the Army and assigned to the United States Army Air Forces. He was assigned to Capt. Glenn Miller&#x27;s band at the request of Miller, who considered him the best singer in the armed services. Martin later said he felt as though he had &quot;stumbled into heaven through the side door.&quot; Martin was later promoted to technical sergeant in the Air Transport Command and stationed in India, where Brig. Gen. William H. Tunner, commanding the Hump Airlift, put him to work as an entertainer, forming a troupe of amateur talent from the command and taking it around the various bases to perform.

After the war, Martin signed with Mercury Records, then a small independent label run out of Chicago, Illinois. He cut 25 records in 1946 and 1947 for Mercury, including a 1946 recording of &quot;To Each His Own,&quot; which became a million-seller. It was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. This prompted RCA Victor to offer him a record contract, which he signed in 1947 after satisfying his contract obligations to Mercury.

He continued to appear in film musicals during the 1940s and 1950s. His rendition of &quot;Lover Come Back to Me&quot; with Joan Weldon in &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; – based on the music of Sigmund Romberg and starring José Ferrer - was one of the highlights of that film. He also starred as Gaylord Ravenal in the &quot;Show Boat&quot; segment from the 1946 film &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot;.

In 1958, he became the highest paid performer in Las Vegas, signing a five-year deal at the Desert Inn, earning $25,000 a week.

In an unlikely pairing, Martin recorded for the Motown Records label in the mid-1960s, scoring a minor hit with the record &quot;Talkin&#x27; To Your Picture&quot;.

In the 1970s, Martin was a television spokesperson for the Lady Brevoni brand of pantyhose sold in supermarkets.

Martin was a stockholder in the Parvin-Dohrmann Corporation, a hotel and casino company that owned the Flamingo Las Vegas.

Martin&#x27;s professional singing career extended well into his nineties.

==Personal life==
Martin and Alice Faye divorced in 1940.

In 1948, Martin married actress and dancer Cyd Charisse. They remained married for 60 years until her death on June 17, 2008. They had one son together, Tony Martin, Jr., who predeceased his father in 2011 following injuries sustained in an auto accident.

Martin and Charisse were both Republicans who campaigned for Richard Nixon.

Martin died on the evening of July 27, 2012, of natural causes at age 98. He was buried at the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. He was remembered by the Hollywood Reporter as &quot;one of the last big stars from Hollywood&#x27;s golden age of musicals.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Salem&quot; (CA-139) is a heavy cruiser completed for the United States Navy shortly after World War II and commissioned in 1949. The second ship of her class, she was the world&#x27;s last heavy cruiser to enter service and is the last remaining. She was decommissioned in 1959 after serving in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. She is open to the public as a museum ship in Quincy, Massachusetts.

==Construction==
&quot;Salem&quot; was laid down on 4 July 1945 by the Bethlehem Steel Co.&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched on 25 March 1947, sponsored by Miss Mary G. Coffey and commissioned on 14 May 1949, with Captain John C. Daniel in command. Her main battery held the world&#x27;s first automatic 8&quot; guns and were the first 8&quot; naval guns to use cased ammunition instead of shell and bag loading.

==Service career==
After a visit to Salem, Massachusetts, on 4 July 1949, &quot;Salem&quot; underwent three months of shakedown at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, between July and October 1949, followed by post-shakedown repairs at the Boston Navy Yard. She then made two cruises to Guantanamo in November and December 1949 and participated in maneuvers with the Atlantic Fleet in early 1950.

&quot;Salem&quot; departed the United States East Coast on 3 May 1950 and, on 17 May, relieved &quot;Newport News&quot; (CA-148) as flagship of the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. During this, the first of seven deployments to the Mediterranean as fleet flagship, &quot;Salem&quot; visited ports in Malta, Italy, France, Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, and Algeria, and participated in training exercises. On 22 September, she was relieved by &quot;Newport News&quot; and returned to the United States.

After three weeks at Boston, &quot;Salem&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet for maneuvers and, on 3 January 1951, sailed for six weeks of intensive gunnery training at Guantanamo. She completed her training off Bermuda; and, on 20 March, sailed for the Mediterranean to relieve &quot;Newport News&quot; as 6th Fleet flagship. On 19 September, she was relieved by &quot;Des Moines&quot; (CA-134) and returned to the United States for four months of overhaul at Boston.

&quot;Salem&quot; sailed on 1 February 1952 for refresher training at Guantanamo and returned to Boston on 29 March for repairs. On 19 April, she sailed for her third Mediterranean deployment, relieving &quot;Newport News&quot; at Algiers on 28 April. Besides the normal port calls and exercises, &quot;Salem&quot; participated in Exercise &quot;Beehive II,&quot; which involved units of the United States, British, Italian, French, and Greek navies. She was relieved once again by &quot;Des Moines&quot; on 29 September and arrived in Boston on 9 October.

After four months of local operations, &quot;Salem&quot; sailed for Guantanamo Bay on 24 January 1953 for training. Returning to Boston on 27 February, she sailed for the Mediterranean on 17 April and again relieved &quot;Newport News&quot; as flagship. Her fourth deployment was marked by Exercise &quot;Weldfest&quot; and by emergency relief work after the 1953 Ionian earthquake. &quot;Salem&quot; was the first American ship to arrive on the scene, and provided relief supplies and assistance from 13 August until her own stocks ran low four days later. Relieved by &quot;Des Moines&quot; as flagship on 9 October, she returned to Boston on 24 October and entered the shipyard for overhaul.

On 6 February 1954, &quot;Salem&quot; sailed again for Guantanamo Bay and returned on 7 April after refresher training. She left Boston on 30 April; and, on arrival in the Mediterranean on 12 May, again assumed duties as 6th Fleet flagship. Relieved by &quot;Des Moines&quot; at Lisbon on 22 September, she returned to Boston on 29 September. In October and November 1954, she participated in war games with the Atlantic Fleet.

Between 19 January and 22 February 1955, &quot;Salem&quot; made her annual cruise to Guantanamo Bay for training. After a two-week reserve training cruise, the cruiser sailed for the Mediterranean on 2 May and relieved &quot;Newport News&quot; on 19 May. During this, her sixth deployment, she participated in a NATO exercise and a Franco-American naval exercise, with Under Secretary of the Navy Thomas S. Gates embarked as an observer. &quot;Salem&quot; departed Barcelona on 23 September and returned to Boston on 2 October 1955 for a four-month overhaul.

The cruiser left Boston on 16 February 1956 for training at Guantanamo in preparation for a 20-month cruise as &quot;permanent&quot; flagship of the Commander, 6th Fleet with homeport at Villefranche-sur-Mer. She returned to Boston on 5 April and sailed for the Mediterranean on 1 May. While she was at sea, the Suez Crisis broke out; and she was diverted to Rhodes in the Eastern Mediterranean where she joined the fleet on 14 May and assumed her flagship duties. She remained in the eastern Mediterranean until mid-June and returned when fighting broke out on 30 October. In April and August 1957, the 6th Fleet, by its presence in the eastern Mediterranean, twice showed United States support for the government of Jordan threatened by subversion. The cruiser departed the Mediterranean on 26 June 1958 and arrived at Norfolk on 4 July.

&quot;Salem&quot; was used to portray the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; in the 1956 film &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot;, although the original German ship had a single triple gun turret placed forward of the superstructure where the &quot;Salem&quot; has two triple gun turrets forward of its superstructure. Her original hull number of 139 is also clearly visible in several exterior shots. The plot of the film includes reference to the number explaining the true fact that the German navy often disguised raiders like the &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; as neutral ships, the US being neutral at the time.

In 1958, the cruiser arrived in Monaco to celebrate the birth of Albert II, born to Rainier III, Prince of Monaco and Princess Grace Kelly.

&quot;Salem&quot; was scheduled for inactivation after her return from the Mediterranean, but the request of Lebanon on 15 August 1958 for aid against an anticipated coup led to a short reprieve. &quot;Salem&quot; had relieved on 11 August as flagship of Commander, 2nd Fleet and, on 2 September, departed Norfolk, visited Augusta Bay and Barcelona during a ten-day cruise in the Mediterranean, and returned to Norfolk on 30 September. She reported to the Norfolk Navy Yard on 7 October for inactivation, disembarked the Commander of the 2nd Fleet on 25 October and was decommissioned on 30 January 1959. She was stored as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The ship was surveyed in 1981 for possible reactivation as part of the 600 ship navy project, and while the inspection results showed she was in excellent condition, funding to reactivate &quot;Salem&quot; and her sister &quot;Des Moines&quot; was not secured from Congress.

=== Museum ship ===
In October 1994, &quot;Salem&quot; was returned to Quincy, Massachusetts, where she is now a museum ship as part of the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum. &quot;Salem&quot; also houses the Museum, The US Navy Cruiser Sailors Association Museum, and the US Navy SEALs Exhibit room.

&quot;Salem&quot; was closed to tourists in September 2013 when the wharf to which she was moored became unstable. The wharf&#x27;s former owner, the MBTA, forced the closure. Subsequently, the wharf was sold to private interests. &quot;Salem&quot; was opened on weekends in May 2015.

Scheduled since the wharf closure to be moved to a location in East Boston, the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum signed a deal with the landowner in February 2016 to keep &quot;Salem&quot; at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy until at least 2021 and was again opened for visits on weekends starting April 2016.

In August 2017 &quot;Salem&quot; was closed to the public while she was being relocated to a different pier in the shipyard. As of August 2019 she was opened to the public on weekends.

==In the media==
===Film===
USS &quot;Salem&quot; depicted the German pocket battleship, , in the 1956 film The Battle of the River Plate.

&quot;Salem&quot; was featured in the 2016 feature film &quot;The Finest Hours&quot; directed by Craig Gillespie. She served as the set of the tanker which broke in two off of Cape Cod on 15 February 1952 making for the most daring and notable United States Coast Guard search and rescues. Many machinery spaces and passageways were used for filming and can be spotted throughout the movie.

===Television===
The ship was featured on &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;. In late 2016, USS &quot;Salem&quot; partnered with Ghost Ship Harbor, to create a haunted attraction on the deck of the ship. The event was a fundraiser for USS &quot;Salem&quot; and saw thousands of people visit the ship during the month of October to see the haunted houses that were built. In 2017 Fodor&#x27;s ranked it the scariest haunted house in Massachusetts.

&quot;Salem&quot; was featured as a haunted location on the paranormal TV series &quot;Most Terrifying Places&quot; which aired on the Travel Channel in 2019. The show featured tour guides and visitors who claimed to see the ghost of a former sailor who was badly burned in an explosion while on board . He was brought aboard the &quot;Salem&quot; when it was docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and was used to transport the men who were injured in the fire to the medical bay.

<text>Sir Hugh Carleton Greene (15 November 1910 – 19 February 1987) was a British television executive and journalist. He was director-general of the BBC from 1960 to 1969.

After working for newspapers in the 1930s, Greene spent most of his later career with the BBC, rising through the managerial ranks of overseas broadcasting and then news for the main domestic channels. He encountered opposition from some politicians and activists opposed to his modernising agenda, but under his leadership the BBC was recognised to be outperforming its commercial rival, ITV, and was awarded a second television channel (BBC 2) by the British government and authorised to introduce colour television to Britain.

After retiring from the BBC, Greene published several books, including a collaboration with his brother, the novelist Graham Greene, and made television programmes both for the BBC and ITV.

==Background==
Greene was born on 15 November 1910 in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, the youngest of four sons and the fifth of the six children of Charles Henry Greene, headmaster of Berkhamsted School, and his wife (and cousin), Marion Raymond, the daughter of the Rev Carleton Greene, vicar of Great Barford, with his mother being a cousin of the Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson. Among the couple&#x27;s other children were Graham Greene, the novelist, and Raymond Greene, a Doctor of Medicine and a mountaineer. Greene was educated at Berkhamsted School and at Merton College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in classical moderations (1931) and English (1933).

Before his undergraduate years at Merton, Greene had spent some time in Germany and, after graduating, he returned there, beginning his career as a journalist. He worked in Munich for two British publications, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and in 1934 he joined the Berlin office of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, becoming its chief correspondent in 1938. The writer of his entry in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Colin Shaw, comments that Greene&#x27;s direct witnessing of the Nazis deeply influenced him for the rest of his life, &quot;teaching him to hate intolerance and the degradation of character to which the loss of freedom led&quot;. He was expelled from Germany in May 1939 in reprisal for the expulsion from London of a journalist and Nazi agent, Rudolf Rösel.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; sent Greene to Warsaw but his time there was brief. In September 1939, the Germans invaded Poland and he was forced to leave. As the war spread in Europe he reported from Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, the Netherlands, Belgium and finally France, returning to Britain in June 1940, narrowly escaping the German army&#x27;s arrival in Paris. After a few months in the Royal Air Force as a pilot officer in intelligence, he was released to join the BBC German Service, becoming its news editor. Throughout the war, the BBC remained committed to impartial and accurate reporting to enemy-occupied territories. In 1940, Greene was one of the first to undergo security clearance vetting by MI5 while working at the BBC, for MI5 suspected him to be a communist.

==Early broadcasting career==
At the end of the war the British government asked Greene to return to Germany as controller of broadcasting in the British-occupied zone. He established a peacetime radio service, Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk, served as its first director-general and gave it a charter on the lines of the BBC. In 1948, the station was handed over to the German authorities and Greene returned to England. He was appointed head of the BBC&#x27;s eastern European service in 1949, just before the Russians began to jam its broadcasts. In 1950, he was again seconded for government service, this time as head of emergency information services for the Federation of Malaya, helping to combat the efforts of communist insurgents. Among his assistants was the future prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kwan Yew, who became a close friend.

On his return to London, Greene resumed his work at the BBC. First, in 1952, as assistant controller of overseas services, and then, in 1955, as controller. In 1956, Sir Norman Bottomley, director of administration and deputy to the director-general, Sir Ian Jacob, retired. Greene was appointed to succeed him; Shaw comments that this temporarily distanced him from any direct involvement with programmes, but clearly identified him as the potential successor to Jacob, who was due to retire in 1959.

After two years Greene was appointed to a newly-created post – director of news and current affairs. It was established in the wake of television&#x27;s rise to overtake radio as the dominant broadcasting medium, and Greene&#x27;s brief was &quot;to secure overall co-ordination and editorial direction of topical output in both radio and television&quot;. In this role Greene encountered resistance to modernisation by key figures in the BBC news division, headed by Tahu Hole. The commercial Independent Television News (ITN), launched in 1955 was strongly outperforming the BBC in innovation, flair and audience numbers. Jacob backed Greene&#x27;s modernising approach, and moved Hole to be director of administration. Among the reforms introduced by Greene was the abandonment of a restrictive and bureaucratic system for covering party politics. Before the 1959 general election he announced, &quot;We are going to cover the election, nationally and locally, like any other news story – on the basis of news value&quot;, putting the BBC on a similar basis to ITN and the press.

==BBC director-general==
Greene&#x27;s appointment to succeed Jacob was announced in 1959. It was received with widespread approval by BBC staff, partly because Greene was the first director-general to have risen through the ranks of BBC management, and partly because his transformation of news and current affairs coverage had impressed the programme makers and made them feel valued as they had not felt previously. He assumed the post on 1 January 1960. Early on, Greene abolished the position of director of news and current affairs, and appointed himself editor-in-chief. In that capacity, Shaw writes, he remained &quot;a working journalist capable, when the need arose, of dealing expeditiously with those editorial issues that were referred to him&quot;. As director-general he led a modernisation of the BBC, increasing its audience after the creation of a rival commercial ITV television network (the first contractors were on air from September 1955) which had become much more popular than the BBC.

Soon after Greene&#x27;s appointment, the government set up a committee of inquiry into broadcasting, chaired by the industrialist Sir Harry Pilkington. Greene pressed the BBC&#x27;s case, arguing that the interests outside television of the commercial franchise holders constituted a conflict of loyalties with their public service obligations, and that the quality of programmes from commercial television was greatly inferior to that of the BBC&#x27;s. The committee&#x27;s report was highly favourable to Greene and the BBC, and despite pressure from the commercial television lobby, the government awarded the BBC the proposed third channel and introduction of colour television.

In a short history of the corporation, the BBC says of Greene&#x27;s tenure, &quot;he encouraged programme-makers to reflect the social changes and attitudes of the Sixties&quot;:

Greene was more frank in private:

Although under Greene&#x27;s leadership the BBC caught up with and overtook commercial television in popularity among the British public as a whole, there were dissenting voices. Harold Wilson, who became prime minister in 1964, was less tolerant than his predecessors of the BBC&#x27;s satire and lack of deference, and Mary Whitehouse, a campaigner who described herself as &quot;an evangelical Christian and moral crusader&quot;, accused Greene of being &quot;the devil incarnate&quot; for allowing the broadcast of dramas with sexual content or bad language. Greene ignored Whitehouse&#x27;s protestations and commissioned a painting of her naked with five breasts for his office which he threw darts at.

Wilson&#x27;s hostility was harder to ignore. When the chairman of the BBC, Lord Normanbrook, died in 1967, his successor Lord Hill (hitherto chairman of the BBC&#x27;s rival, the Independent Television Authority) was appointed reportedly at Wilson&#x27;s request. Greene at that time held Hill in contempt. If, as was suspected at the time, Wilson&#x27;s motive was to provoke Greene into resigning, the ploy almost succeeded, but Greene&#x27;s advisers convinced him that if he resigned the whole board of management of the BBC would resign with him, leaving the corporation &quot;at the mercy of its new master&quot; as one colleague put it.

Greene and Hill established a working relationship that was uneasy but viable. Nonetheless, after a year Greene began to look forward to retirement. After more than eight years in post, he left in March 1969. To make it clear that the decision was his, rather than Hill&#x27;s, the latter proposed that Greene should become a member of the BBC&#x27;s board of governors. He did so, and served for two years before resigning, feeling that his presence was inhibiting his successor.

==Later years==

After he left the post of director general, Greene made some programmes for the BBC and also – causing some disapproval at the BBC – for ITV. He edited several collections of stories about the rivals of Sherlock Holmes, collaborated with his brother Graham on &quot;Victorian Villanies&quot; (1984) and became chairman of Bodley Head, his brother&#x27;s publisher. His lifelong hatred of totalitarianism and dictatorship led him to be active in campaigning against the military junta that ruled Greece after the coup of 1967. After civilian rule was reestablished, Greene was adviser to the Greek government on the constitution of broadcasting.

==Personal life==

Greene was married four times. In October 1934, he married Helga Mary (b. 1916), the daughter of Samuel Guinness, a banker, of London. They had two sons; the couple divorced in 1948. In September 1951, he married Elaine Shaplen (b. 1920), the daughter of Louis Gilbert, an accountant, of New York. They had two sons, and divorced in 1969. In May 1970, Greene married the German actress Tatjana Sais (1910–1981); they had lived together in the late 1940s. She died in 1981, and in December 1984, he married Sarah Mary Manning Grahame (b. 1941), a script supervisor from Australia. There were no children of the third and fourth marriages.

Greene died from cancer in King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital, London, on 19 February 1987.

==Honours==

Greene was appointed OBE in 1950 and knighted (KCMG) in 1964. He received honorary degrees from the University of East Anglia, the University of York and the Open University. The West German government awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit in 1977. In 1985 he received the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honour from the German Eduard Rhein Foundation for outstanding work related to the promotion of scientific research and of learning, the arts and culture. The road where the German radio station he helped to organise is located is now named after him (Hugh-Greene-Weg).
