<text>Proposition 65 (formally titled The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, and also referred to as Prop 65) is a California law passed by direct voter initiative in 1986 by a 63%–37% vote. Its goals are to protect drinking water sources from toxic substances that cause cancer or birth defects and to reduce or eliminate exposures to those chemicals generally, such as in consumer products, by requiring warnings in advance of those exposures, with the intended goal being that companies choose to reformulate their products without the substances rather than simply providing notice of such substances in their product.

==The proposition==

In 1986, political strategists including Tom Hayden and his wife, environmental activist Jane Fonda, thought that an initiative addressing toxic pollutants would bring more left leaning voters to the polls to help Democrat Tom Bradley in his gubernatorial race against incumbent Republican George Deukmejian, who had vetoed several pollution cleanup bills. Hayden and others funded the initiative, and found three environmental attorneys to write it, including David Roe who did not expect it to pass. Voters passed it 2–1, but did not elect Bradley.

The act states: &quot;no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly discharge or release a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity into water&quot; or into anywhere that feeds a drinking water source. It also says that &quot;no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose&quot; anyone to those chemicals &quot;without first giving clear and reasonable warning.&quot;

Proposition 65 is administered by CalEPA&#x27;s California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). Proposition 65 regulates substances officially listed by California as causing cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm, in two ways. The first statutory requirement of Proposition 65 prohibits businesses from knowingly discharging listed substances into drinking water sources, or onto land where the substances can pass into drinking water sources. The second prohibits businesses from knowingly exposing individuals to listed substances without providing a clear and reasonable warning. The requirements apply to amounts above what would present a 1-in-100,000 risk of cancer assuming lifetime exposure (for carcinogens), or above one thousandth (1/1000) of the no observable effect level (for reproductive toxins).

An official list of substances covered by Proposition 65 is maintained and made publicly available. Chemicals are added to or removed from the official list based on California&#x27;s analysis of current scientific information. All substances listed show their known risk factors, a unique CAS chemical classification number, the date they were listed, and, if so, whether they have been delisted. As a result of lawsuits, the list now also contains substances known only to cause cancer in animals, and contains over 900 substances.

Proposition 65 has had limited success in reducing exposures to known toxic chemicals, especially in consumer products, and its successes illustrate gaps in the effectiveness of federal toxics laws (see below). It remains politically controversial even after more than 30 years (see below), in large part because it, in effect, requires businesses to know the scientific safety level for specific cancer- and birth defect-causing chemicals that those businesses are intentionally exposing members of the public to, unless government has already set those levels. According to the California Environmental Protection Agency, &quot;Proposition 65 has... increased public awareness about the adverse effects of exposures to listed chemicals... [and] provided an incentive for manufacturers to remove listed chemicals from their products... Although Proposition 65 has benefited Californians, it has come at a cost for companies doing business in the state.&quot;

==Enforcement==
Enforcement is carried out through civil lawsuits against Proposition 65 violators. These lawsuits may be brought by the California Attorney General, any district attorney, or certain city attorneys (those in cities with a population exceeding 750,000). Lawsuits may also be brought by private parties &quot;acting in the public interest,&quot; but only after providing notice of the alleged violation to the Attorney General, the appropriate district attorney and city attorney, and the business accused of the violation.

A Proposition 65 Notice of Violation must provide adequate information to allow the recipient to assess the nature of the alleged violation. A notice must comply with the information and procedural requirements specified in regulations. A private party may not pursue an enforcement action directly under Proposition 65 if one of the government officials noted above initiates an action within sixty days of the notice. After 2003, private enforcers must also serve a certificate of merit (statement of expert consultation(s) supporting belief of reasonable and meritorious private action) as a means of preventing frivolous enforcement actions.

A business found to be in violation of Proposition 65 is subject to civil penalties of up to $2,500 per day for each violation. In addition, the business may be ordered by a court of law to stop committing the violation. Other penalties may apply, including unfair business practices violations as limited under California Proposition 64 (2004).

From 1988 (when the initiative went into effect) until 2020, there have been more than 30,000 violation claims, targeting over 100,000 products, filed by citizen prosecutors. From 2000 to 2020, businesses paid more than $370 million in settlements, with almost three quarters of that amount going to attorneys, and the majority of that going to a small group of perpetual litigants. One example cited by the Los Angeles Times is that of the for-profit company &quot;Safe Products for Californians&quot;, run by Kenneth Moore and his lawyer ex-wife Tanya Moore, who received almost $700,000 in legal fees from over 100 lawsuits (half against Amazon sellers) in which Kenneth was her only client.

If a company&#x27;s product contains a chemical on the list, but the intended use of the product would not expose the customer to the hazards found by scientific research (for example, a topical soap that contains a chemical known to cause cancer when eaten), the burden is placed on the company to prove that its product will not cause harm if it chooses not to label the product. Many companies therefore find it less expensive to simply add the Prop 65 warning to their products, regardless of the danger to the consumer.

==Accomplishments==
Proposition 65 has caused large numbers of consumer products to be reformulated to remove toxic ingredients, both through settlements of enforcement actions and through manufacturers avoiding certain materials so they do not need to put a Prop 65 warning on their products. The addition of new chemicals to the Prop 65 list correlates with a shift in nationwide samples of blood and urine, reducing concentration of listed chemicals and increase in close substitutes.

Proposition 65 has also caused government and industry to cooperate on scientific issues of chemical risk, resulting in risk-based standards for 282 toxic chemicals in the law&#x27;s first few years of operation, an accomplishment described by a Governor&#x27;s Task Force as &quot;100 years of progress [by federal standards] in the areas of hazard identification, risk assessment, and exposure assessment.&quot; The existence of clear numerical standards has significantly assisted efforts to comply with the law, and to enforce it in situations of non-compliance.

==Warning label==
The following warning language is standard on products sold in California if they contain chemicals on the Proposition 65 list and the amount of exposure caused by the product is not within defined safety limits:

WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.

The wording can be changed as necessary, as long as it communicates that the chemical in question is known to the state to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm. For exposures from other sources, such as car exhaust in a parking garage, a standard sign might read: &quot;This area contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm&quot;.

==Controversy and abuse==
Political controversy over the law, including industry attempts to have it preempted by federal law, has died down, although preemption bills continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress, most recently H.R. 6022 (introduced June 6, 2018). However, enforcement actions remain controversial. Many Proposition 65 complaints are filed on behalf of straw man plaintiffs by private attorneys, some of whose businesses are built entirely on filing Proposition 65 lawsuits.

The law has also been criticized for causing &quot;over-warning&quot; or &quot;meaningless warnings,&quot; and this risk has been recognized by a California court. There is no penalty for posting an unnecessary warning sign, and to the extent that warnings are vague or overused, they may not communicate much information to the end user. Many companies now routinely attach Prop 65 warning labels to any product of theirs that they think might possibly contain one of the 900 listed chemicals without testing to see whether the chemical is really present in their product and without reformulating their product, because it is cheaper to do so than to run the risk of being sued by Prop 65 enforcers.

Examples of warning signs can be found at gas stations, hardware suppliers, grocery stores, drug stores, medical facilities, parking garages, hotels, apartment complexes, retail stores, banks, and restaurants, warning about hazardous chemicals in items for sale, or present in the immediate environment. Utility companies mail a Prop 65 notice to all customers each year to warn them about exposures to natural gas, petroleum products and sandblasting.

Abuse of enforcement lawsuits has also been a consistent theme of Proposition 65 opponents, who criticize the motives of citizen enforcers. Industry critics and corporate defense lawyers charge that Proposition 65 is &quot;a clever and irritating mechanism used by litigious NGOs and others to publicly spank politically incorrect opponents ranging from the American gun industry to seafood retailers, etc.&quot; Critics also note that the majority of settlement money collected from businesses has been used to pay plaintiffs&#x27; attorney fees. Businesses paid over $14.58 million in attorney fees and costs in 2012, 71% of all settlement money paid.

Because the law allows private citizens to sue and collect penalties from any business violating the law, lawyers and law firms have been criticized for using Proposition 65 to force monetary settlements out of Californian businesses. In the past the Attorney General&#x27;s office has cited several instances of settlements where plaintiff attorneys received significant awards without providing for environmental benefit to the people of California, resulting in a requirement that the Attorney General&#x27;s office must approve any pre-trial Proposition 65 settlement.

==Reform efforts==
In the 2013–14 session of the California State Assembly, a consensus bill, AB 227, introduced by Assemblyman Mike Gatto (D-Los Angeles), effectively offered to protect certain small companies in specified circumstances from the threat of citizen enforcement lawsuits, by providing them with a streamlined compliance procedure and limited penalties. The bill was passed unanimously, with support from Proposition 65 proponents and supporters, and was enacted on October 10, 2013.

Following the success of AB 227, Gov. Jerry Brown announced on May 7, 2013, that his office plans to introduce a proposal to reform Proposition 65. In 2017, Brown advocated for more reform to Prop 65 to reduce &quot;frivolous shakedown lawsuits.&quot;

==Alleged violators==
 the below list includes some of the named Fortune 500 companies that have been sued or received an intent to sue for allegedly not disclosing the Prop 65 warning on one or more of their products. The list includes, but is not limited to:
* Amazon
* CVS
* Walmart
* Target
* Walgreens
* Disney
* Dollar General
* Whole Foods
* McDonald&#x27;s (settled for US$3 million in 2002) 

In most cases, such as McDonald&#x27;s, Walgreens, and Disney, the listed chemicals have been removed. As of August 2019, Amazon has received over 1,000 notices of &quot;Intent to Sue&quot; under Prop 65. Amazon require their sellers to disclose if their products contain Prop 65 chemicals, but some have allegedly not done so.

==List of chemicals==
Proposition 65 requires that the governor revise and republish at least once per year the list of chemicals known to the State to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. It also requires substances identified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as causing cancer in humans or laboratory animals to be added to the list.

There also exists a &quot;Safe harbor List&quot; with tolerance thresholds for some of the chemicals named in the Proposition 65 list. Concentrations under the tolerance threshold do not legally require the warning label.

<doc id="570106" wikidata="Q741053" url="?curid=570106" title="William Howard Russell">
<text>Sir William Howard Russell, (28 March 182710 February 1907) was an Irish reporter with &quot;The Times&quot;, and is considered to have been one of the first modern war correspondents. He spent 22 months covering the Crimean War, including the Siege of Sevastopol and the Charge of the Light Brigade. He later covered events during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the American Civil War, the Austro-Prussian War, and the Franco-Prussian War. His dispatches from Crimea to &quot;The&quot; &quot;Times&quot; are regarded as the world&#x27;s first war correspondence.

==Career==

As a young reporter, Russell reported on a brief military conflict between Prussian and Danish troops in Denmark in 1850.

Initially sent by the editor John Delane to Malta to cover British support for the Ottoman Empire against Russia in 1854, Russell despised the term &quot;war correspondent&quot; but his coverage of the conflict brought him international renown, and Florence Nightingale later credited her entry into wartime nursing to his reports. The Crimean medical care, shelter and protection of all ranks by Mary Seacole was also publicised by Russell and by other contemporary journalists, rescuing her from bankruptcy.

Russell was described by one of the soldiers on the frontlines thus: &quot;a vulgar low Irishman, [who] sings a good song, drinks anyone&#x27;s brandy and water and smokes as many cigars as a Jolly Good Fellow. He is just the sort of chap to get information, particularly out of youngsters.&quot; This reputation led to Russell&#x27;s being blacklisted from some circles, including British commander Lord Raglan, who advised his officers to refuse to speak with the reporter.

His dispatches were hugely significant; for the first time the public could read about the reality of warfare. Shocked and outraged, the public&#x27;s backlash from his reports led the Government to re-evaluate the treatment of troops and led to Florence Nightingale&#x27;s involvement in revolutionising battlefield treatment.

On 20 September 1854, Russell covered the battle above the Alma River—writing his missive the following day in an account book seized from a Russian corpse. The story, written in the form of a letter to Delane, was supportive of the British troops and paid particular attention to the battlefield surgeons&#x27; &quot;humane barbarity&quot; and the lack of ambulance care for wounded troops. He later covered the Siege of Sevastopol where he coined the phrase &quot;thin red line&quot; in referring to British troops (93rd Highlanders) at Balaclava, writing that &quot;[The Russians] dash on towards that thin red streak topped with a line of steel...&quot;.

Following Russell&#x27;s reports of the appalling conditions suffered by the Allied troops conducting the siege, including an outbreak of cholera, Samuel Morton Peto and his partners built the Grand Crimean Central Railway, which was a major factor leading to the success of the siege.

Russell wrote about his meetings with Mary Seacole and wrote highly of Seacole&#x27;s skill as a healer: &quot;A more tender or skilful hand about a wound or a broken limb could not be found among our best surgeons.&quot;

He spent December 1854 in Constantinople on holiday, returning in early 1855. Russell left Crimea in December 1855 to be replaced by the Constantinople correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;.

In 1856, Russell was sent to Moscow to describe the coronation of Tsar Alexander II and in the following year was sent to India where he witnessed the final re-capture of Lucknow (1858).

In 1861 Russell went to Washington and returned to England in 1863. In July 1865 he sailed on the &quot;Great Eastern&quot; to document the laying of the Atlantic Cable and wrote a book about the voyage with colour illustrations by Robert Dudley. He published diaries of his time in India, the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War, where he describes the warm welcome given him by English-speaking Prussian generals such as Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal.

Russell later accused fellow war correspondent Nicholas Woods of the &quot;Morning Herald&quot; of lying in his articles about the war to try to improve his stories.

==Later life==

In the 1868 General Election, Russell ran unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate for the borough of Chelsea.

He retired as a battlefield correspondent in 1882 and founded the &quot;Army and Navy Gazette&quot;.

Russell was knighted in May 1895. He was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) by King Edward VII on 11 August 1902, a dynastic order handed out by the King without government interference. During the investiture, the King reportedly told Russell &#x27;Don&#x27;t kneel Billy, just stoop&#x27;.

Russell died in 1907 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

==Personal life==
Russell was born into a middle-class family with a mixed Protestant and Catholic background—his father was Protestant, and his mother Catholic. He was baptized into the Church of Ireland but attend Catholic mass and was tutored in religion by his Catholic grandmother. Growing up, his family faced significant financial difficulties, which led to frequent moves between Dublin and Liverpool. Despite this, Russell was able to pass the entrance exams for Trinity College in 1838, though he never completed a degree.

He married twice. His first marriage was to Mary Burrows, of Irish Catholic origin. Despite the hostility of her family, they married on 16 September 1846 in an Anglican ceremony in Howth and had 4 children. She died in 1867. Russell remained widowed for several years before remarrying to 36 year old Countess Antoinette Malvezzi from Ferrara, an Italian noblewoman, in February 1884. The marriage was again met with controversy, as the bride&#x27;s family insisted that any children from the union be raised Roman Catholic, a demand that Russell refused. The marriage was held in Paris in three ceremonies, one Catholic at the , another Anglican at the British Embassy, and a third in a civil ceremony. They remained married until Russell&#x27;s death in 1907. They had two sons and one daughter, none of whom had offspring.

Russell was a Freemason.

As a young man, Russell had had an affair with a German woman from Heligoland, Anna Catharina Oelrichs, with whom he had a son, William Russell, in 1863. There are still Russells on Heligoland.

==Legacy==
Russell&#x27;s dispatches via telegraph from the Crimea remain as his legacy; for the first time he brought the realities of war home to readers. This helped diminish the distance between the home front and remote battle fields. They were collected, edited by the author, and published in two volumes as &quot;The War&quot; in 1856, revised and retitled &quot;History of the British Expedition to the Crimea&quot; in 1858.

Russell&#x27;s war reporting (often in semi-verbatim form) features prominently in Northern Irish poet Ciaran Carson&#x27;s reconstruction of the Crimean War in &quot;Breaking News&quot; (2003).

His biography was written by the first special correspondent of the Manchester Guardian John Black Atkins.

There is a bust of Russell in the crypt at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

<text>BBC Radio Shropshire is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving Shropshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios on Boscobel Drive in Shrewsbury.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 65,000 listeners and a 4.8% share as of December 2023.

==Technical==
The 96 MHz FM signal from The Wrekin is the strongest, and can be heard from outside the county, especially along the M5 and M6 near Birmingham, as well as into western Staffordshire, southern Cheshire and Wrexham.

The other transmitters (on Black Hill near Clun, on Hazler Hill near Church Stretton, and in Mortimer Forest near Ludlow) have a much weaker signal only heard up to about away. These three transmitters are for broadcasting to the south of the county, which has a hilly terrain that reduces the effectiveness of FM transmissions.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 713 in the BBC West Midlands region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Shrewsbury studios from 6 am to 2pm each day.

The station&#x27;s late show, airing from 10 pm to 1 am, originates from either BBC Radio London or BBC Radio Manchester.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Shropshire simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

==Presenters==
===Notable current presenters===
*Jim Hawkins (Weekday daytime)

===Notable former presenters===
*Eleanor Oldroyd (went on to BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 1)

<doc id="570111" wikidata="Q1343700" url="?curid=570111" title="Electronic control unit">
<text>An electronic control unit (ECU), also known as an electronic control module (ECM), is an embedded system in automotive electronics that controls one or more of the electrical systems or subsystems in a car or other motor vehicle.

Modern vehicles have many ECUs, and these can include some or all of the following: engine control module (ECM), powertrain control module (PCM), transmission control module (TCM), brake control module (BCM or EBCM), central control module (CCM), central timing module (CTM), general electronic module (GEM), body control module (BCM), and suspension control module (SCM). These ECUs together are sometimes referred to collectively as the car&#x27;s computer though technically they are all separate computers, not a single one. Sometimes an assembly incorporates several individual control modules (a PCM often controls both the engine and the transmission).

Some modern motor vehicles have up to 150 ECUs. Embedded software in ECUs continues to increase in line count, complexity, and sophistication. Managing the increasing complexity and number of ECUs in a vehicle has become a key challenge for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

==Types==

* Generic industry controller namingIs the naming of controllers where the logical thought of the controller&#x27;s name implies the system the controller is responsible for controlling
* Generic powertrainThe generic powertrain pertains to a vehicle&#x27;s emission system and is the only regulated controller name. 
* Other controllersAll other controller names are decided upon by the individual OEM. The engine controller may have several different names, such as &quot;DME&quot;, &quot;Enhanced Powertrain&quot;, &quot;PGM-FI&quot; and many others. 
* Door control unit (DCU)
* Engine control unit (ECU)not to be confused with &quot;electronic&quot; control unit, the generic term for all these devices
* Electric power steering control unit (PSCU)Generally this will be integrated into the EPS power pack.
* Human–machine interface (HMI)
* Powertrain control module (PCM)Sometimes the functions of the engine control unit and transmission control module (TCM) are combined into a single unit called the Powertrain Control Module.
* Seat control unit
* Speed control unit (SCU)
* Telematic control unit (TCU)
* Transmission control module (TCM)
* Brake control module (BCM; ABS or ESC)
* Battery management system (BMS)

==Key elements==
* Core 
** Microcontroller
* Memory
** SRAM
** EEPROM
** Flash
* Inputs
** Supply Voltage and Ground
** Digital inputs
** Analog inputs
* Outputs
** Actuator drivers (e.g. injectors, relays, valves)
** H bridge drivers for servomotors
** Logic outputs
* Communication links
** Housing
** Bus Transceivers, e.g. for K-Line, CAN, Ethernet
* Embedded Software
** Boot Loader
** Metadata for ECU and Software Identification, Version Management, Checksums
** Functional Software Routines
** Configuration Data

==Design and development==
The development of an ECU involves both hardware and software required to perform the functions expected from that particular module. Automotive ECU&#x27;s are being developed following the V-model. Recently the trend is to dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to develop safe modules by following standards like ISO 26262. It is rare that a module is developed fully from scratch. The design is generally iterative and improvements are made to both the hardware and software. The development of most ECUs is carried out by Tier 1 suppliers based on specifications provided by the OEM.

==Testing and validation==
As part of the development cycle, manufacturers perform detailed FMEAs and other failure analyses to catch failure modes that can lead to unsafe conditions or driver annoyance. Extensive testing and validation activities are carried out as part of the Production part approval process to gain the confidence of the hardware and software. On-board diagnostics or OBD help provide specific data related to which system or component failed or caused a failure during run time and help perform repairs.

==Modifications==
Some people may wish to modify their ECU so as to be able to add or change functionality. However modern ECUs come equipped with protection locks to prevent users from modifying the circuit or exchange chips. The protection locks are a form of digital rights management (DRM), the circumventing of which is illegal in certain jurisdictions. In the United States for example, the DMCA criminalizes circumvention of DRM, though an exemption does apply that allows the owner of a motorized land vehicle circumvention if it is required to allow diagnosis, repair or lawful modification (ie. that does not violate applicable law such as emissions regulations).

<text>Benjamin Levi Madden (né Combs; born March 11, 1979) is an American musician. He is the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the rock band Good Charlottefor which he has received various awardsas well as pop rock collaboration the Madden Brothers. He formed both of these acts with his identical twin brother, Joel Madden, with whom he was a coach on &quot;The Voice Australia&quot; from 2015 to 2016.

== Early life ==
Madden was born Benjamin Levi Combs on March 11, 1979, in Waldorf, Maryland, to Robin Madden and Roger Combs (d. 2019). He has an identical twin, Joel Madden, with whom he formed the band Good Charlotte. He has an older brother named Josh and a younger sister named Sarah. All attended La Plata High School in La Plata, Maryland.

== Career ==
In 1996 Madden started a band named Good Charlotte with his twin brother Joel.

While still playing in Good Charlotte, both Madden brothers wrote and produced for other artists. Madden was a co-writer and co-producer of some of the songs on Hilary Duff&#x27;s &quot;Most Wanted&quot; (2005) compilation album. He later helped write the songs &quot;Amnesia&quot; for pop rockers 5 Seconds of Summer and &quot;No Ordinary Girl&quot; for pop artist Kalin and Myles. He has appeared as a back-up vocalist for artists such as MxPx, Kill Hannah, Apoptygma Berzerk, Mest, The 69 Eyes, Sean Kingston, Three 6 Mafia, Chamillionaire, and Matisyahu.

Madden started the fashion line called Made Clothing in 2001, along with his brothers Joel and Josh. In early 2006, it became DCMA Collective. A DCMA Collective store opened in Los Angeles on March 15, 2008, but later closed.

On April 3, 2010, Madden took part in a boxing match against MTV and VH1 host Riki Rachtman at Ellismania 5: Get These Brawls. The event was hosted by Jason Ellis at The Joint in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Madden beat Rachtman by knockout at 1 minute and 42 seconds into the first round.

On November 11, 2011, Madden and his brother Joel Madden released a free mix-tape, &quot;The Madden Brothers: Before Volume 1&quot;. It contains new artists the brothers were personally interested in. Their brother Josh Madden helped to produce the mix-tape. Then unknown rappers, Machine Gun Kelly, Rockie Fresh, Kreayshawn, Cassie Veggies, HXLT, and Wiz Khalifa all appeared on the mix-tape.

In 2012, Benji appeared on the TV show &quot;The Voice Australia&quot;, alongside Joel as joint mentor-judges.

In early 2013, Benji helped write Tonight Alive&#x27;s song &quot;Breakdown&quot;. He sang back-up vocals at the end of the song and made an appearance in the video.

In 2014, electronic dance music artist TJR released his track &quot;Come Back Down&quot;, which features Benji on the track&#x27;s vocals. The Madden Brothers recording &quot;Greetings from California&quot; was released on September 16, 2014.

In mid-2014, both of the Madden brothers appeared as coaches on &quot;The Voice Kids Australia&quot; in a double chair, after the example of the Dutch &quot;The Voice of Holland&quot; and &quot;The Voice Kids Holland&quot; edition in which the singer&#x27;s duo Nick &amp; Simon appeared as a judging duo between 2010 and 2015. In early 2015, Benji joined Joel as a coach on the main edition of &quot;The Voice&quot;, bringing the number of coaches up to five.

In 2015 Madden and his two brothers formally started their company MDDN, of which Benji is CEO, offering artist management, artist development and creative services. The company gained success quickly with the brothers taking management of Jessie J, Chase Atlantic, Architects, Bad Omens, Waterparks, Eyedress, Poppy and More.

Madden and his brother Joel co-founded the streaming platform Veeps in 2017, and are co-CEOs. Live Nation Entertainment acquired a majority stake in the platform in January 2021.

== Personal life ==
In February 2008, Madden broke up with his long-time fiancée, Sophie Monk.

Madden began dating actress Cameron Diaz in May 2014. The two were unofficially engaged before Christmas Day in 2014 and were married on January 5, 2015, in a Jewish-inspired ceremony, at their Beverly Hills home. On December 30, 2019, they had a daughter via surrogate pregnancy. On March 22, 2024 Benji announced that wife Cameron Diaz and he welcomed their new-born son.

<text>Joel Rueben Madden (né Combs; born March 11, 1979) is an American singer, best known as the lead vocalist for the rock band Good Charlotte. He is also part of the pop rock collaboration the Madden Brothers with his identical twin brother Benji Madden.

==Early life==
Joel Rueben Combs was born in Waldorf, Maryland on March 11, 1979, to Robin Madden and Roger Combs (d. 2019). He has an identical twin, Benji Madden, who plays guitar and sings backing vocals in their band, Good Charlotte. He also has an older brother named Josh Madden who also works in the music industry, and a younger sister named Sarah Madden. Madden attended La Plata High School in La Plata, Maryland.

==Career==

===Good Charlotte===

In 1995, at the age of 16, Madden, his brother Benji, and a friend started their own band. The band was short-lived and the Maddens eventually recruited fellow high schoolers Paul Thomas, Aaron Escolopio, and Billy Martin to form their band Good Charlotte. They took the name Good Charlotte from the children&#x27;s book &quot;Good Charlotte: Girls of the Good Day Orphanage&quot; by Carol Beach York.

===Other projects===
In the 2001 film &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;, Madden and the other Good Charlotte members made a cameo appearance as the band at the school&#x27;s prom. He later had a cameo role in the 2004 film &quot;Fat Albert&quot; and in the 2006 film &quot;Material Girls&quot; with his brother Benji. He also had a guest appearance in the hit Nickelodeon musical comedy series &quot;The Naked Brothers Band&quot;, in which he joined the band for a performance.

Madden started a clothing line called MADE Clothing along with his brothers Benji and Josh. The line is now defunct. In early 2006 MADE Clothing became DCMA Collective. The line is owned by Joel, his brothers Benji Madden, Josh Madden, and friend Tal Cooperman. The Madden brothers also front a production team called Dead Executives.

In November 2007, Nicole Richie and Madden created The Richie Madden Children&#x27;s Foundation. The charity will create and promote an online registry to inspire the purchases of items for moms and their families in need. He is also a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In 2010, with his brother, Madden contributed to &quot;We Are the World 25 for Haiti,&quot; a remake of the song &quot;We Are the World&quot; by USA for Africa, written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie.

On November 23, 2011, Madden was confirmed as one of the four vocal coaches in the first season of the Australian version of the reality singing competition &quot;The Voice&quot;. His brother, Benji Madden was later his mentor on the show. Joel continued on as a coach in seasons two and three with Benji joining Joel as a coach on seasons 4 &amp; 5 in 2015 and 2016. Because of his commitments to &quot;The Voice Australia&quot;, he relocated to Sydney.

Madden is featured in Blood on the Dance Floor&#x27;s fifth studio album on the track &quot;Incomplete and All Alone&quot; released on June 19, 2012. The track was available for free download with pre-orders of the album.

In 2012, Madden joined the 11th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers.

In 2013, Madden also provided songwriting and production assistance to the Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer on their first album. He has also helped write songs with them again for their later album &quot;Sounds Good Feels Good&quot;.

Madden was featured in Alex Kunnari &amp; Heikki L&#x27;s single &quot;City of Sin&quot;, released on July 12, 2013.

Madden was in a pop rock duo with his brother Benji called The Madden Brothers. They released the record &quot;Greetings from California&quot;, on September 16, 2014. The album title &quot;Greetings from California&quot; comes from a conversation that the brothers had over breakfast one morning where they were reminiscing over how far they had come since the days of making music in their bedrooms.

In 2015, Madden appeared as guest in the American TV series &quot;Empire&quot;.

===&quot;The Voice Australia&quot;===
From the beginning of the show in 2012 to 2014, he was a solo coach on &quot;The Voice Australia&quot;. He teamed up with his brother Benji for &quot;The Voice Kids&quot; in 2014 and on the main series in 2015 and 2016. In 2013, Joel won the Logie Award for Most Popular New Male Talent for his role as coach on the program.

===&quot;Ink Master&quot;===
Beginning in 2022, Madden has served as the host of &quot;Ink Master&quot;, replacing Dave Navarro starting with the fourteenth season.

==Personal life==

In July 2004, 25-year-old Madden began dating teen idol Hilary Duff when she was 16. After a long period of tabloid speculation, Duff&#x27;s mother Susan announced their relationship in a June 2005 interview for &quot;Seventeen&quot;. In November 2006, Madden and Duff broke up. Writing for &quot;Paper&quot; in 2015, Abby Schreiber noted that this and similar instances of famous men dating teenage girls had largely been ignored or even defended by tabloids at the time, something she attributed to changing public attitudes as well as tabloids and publicists having more control of information prior to the rise of social media.

Madden started dating Nicole Richie in December 2006. They have two children: a daughter born in 2008 and a son born in 2009. The couple confirmed their engagement in February 2010, and married on December 11, 2010. Madden has residences in both Los Angeles and Sydney. Good Charlotte were particularly popular in Australia, and Madden has since labelled the country his &quot;home away from home.&quot;

Madden has a trademark habit of chewing toothpicks to help reduce the number of cigarettes he smokes a day.

Madden is a Christian. He was raised as a Pentecostal in the Church of God denomination.

<doc id="570124" wikidata="Q1659242" url="?curid=570124" title="Sock hop">
<text>A sock hop or sox hop, often also called a record hop or just a hop, was an informal (but officially organized) dance event for teenagers in mid-20th-century North America, featuring popular music.

== History ==
Sock hops were held as early as 1944 by the American Junior Red Cross to raise funds during World War II. They then became a fad among American teenagers in 1948. Sock hops were commonly held at high schools and other educational institutions, often in the school gymnasium or cafeteria. The term came about because dancers were required to remove their hard-soled shoes to protect the varnished floor of the gymnasium. The music at a sock hop was usually played from vinyl records, sometimes presented by a disc jockey. Occasionally there were live bands. 

In later years, &quot;hops&quot; became strongly associated with the 1950s and early rock and roll. &quot;At the Hop&quot;, a song by Danny &amp; the Juniors that debuted in 1957, names many popular and novelty dances and otherwise documented what occurred at a hop. In subsequent decades, with the widespread popularity of sneakers and other types of indoors-only footwear, the practice of removing shoes was dropped. The term then came to be applied more generally to any informal dance for teenagers.

==Revival==
The term caught on in England in the late 1980s during a British rockabilly revival, led by groups like The Stray Cats. &quot;Life Begins at the Hop&quot;, a song celebrating sock hops, became the first charting single for XTC. The Owl City song &quot;Fireflies&quot; makes reference to the sock hop in the second verse.

<text>Kirk Harold Gibson (born May 28, 1957) is an American former professional baseball outfielder and manager. He is currently a color commentator for the Detroit Tigers on Bally Sports Detroit and a special assistant for the Tigers. Gibson spent most of his career with the Detroit Tigers, but also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kansas City Royals, and Pittsburgh Pirates. He batted and threw left-handed.

While with the Dodgers, Gibson was named the National League MVP in . During his career, he hit two dramatic home runs in the World Series, each one coming against an eventual Hall of Fame relief pitcher. With the Tigers in 1984, he clinched the title in Game 5 with a three-run homer off Goose Gossage, who had refused to walk him with a base open. With the Dodgers in 1988, Gibson faced closer Dennis Eckersley in the ninth inning of the first game and hit a pinch-hit walk-off home run—often described as one of the most exciting moments in World Series history. He was named to the All-Star team twice as a reserve, in 1985 and 1988, but declined the invitation both times.

Following his retirement as a player, he spent five seasons as a television analyst in Detroit and then became a coach for the Tigers in 2003. He became the Diamondbacks&#x27; bench coach in 2007 and was promoted to interim manager in 2010 following the mid-season dismissal of A. J. Hinch. On October 4, 2010, the Diamondbacks removed the &quot;interim&quot; label, naming Gibson their manager for the 2011 season. He served as the Diamondbacks&#x27; manager until September 26, 2014. Gibson returned to the broadcast booth in 2015 as a part-time commentator for Tigers TV broadcasts, and was named a regular television analyst for the Tigers in 2019.

==Biography==

===Early life and collegiate career===
Gibson was born in Pontiac, Michigan, on May 28, 1957, and grew up in nearby Waterford. Gibson graduated from Waterford Kettering High School in 1975, and attended Michigan State University, where he was an All-American wide receiver for the Michigan State Spartans football team. Gibson led the Spartans to a tie for the Big Ten Conference title, setting school and conference receiving records, starring in the Hula Bowl and Senior Bowl, and making several All-America teams. For his accomplishments on the football field, Gibson was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in January 2017.

At the suggestion of Spartan football coach Darryl Rogers, Gibson played college baseball for the Michigan State Spartans baseball team. Gibson played only one year of college baseball, and batted .390 with 16 home runs and 52 runs batted in (RBIs) in 48 games.

===Detroit Tigers===
The Detroit Tigers selected Gibson in the first round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft and the St. Louis Cardinals selected him in the seventh round of the 1979 NFL draft. He chose to sign with his hometown Tigers.

Gibson made his major league debut in 1979 and played as the regular right fielder for the Tigers from 1983 to 1987. He helped the Tigers win the 1984 World Series. He became a free agent after the 1985 season but received no significant offers because of what was later determined to be collusion among the owners of MLB teams. He re-signed with the Tigers and in 1987, helped them to win the American League East by two games over the Blue Jays in an enthraling divisional race. However, Detroit lost the 1987 American League Championship Series to the eventual World Champion Twins.

Early in his career, Gibson was proclaimed by manager Sparky Anderson to be the next Mickey Mantle. Anderson later apologized and said that probably put too much pressure on a young and inexperienced Gibson. Nevertheless, Gibson was considered a versatile power/speed player in the 1980s who was able to hit home runs as well as steal bases. He finished in the top 10 in home runs 3 times in his career and ranked in the top 10 in stolen bases four times. He fell one home run short of becoming the first Tiger in the 30–30 club in 1985.

Gibson was known for hitting clutch home runs. In the eighth inning of Game 5 of the 1984 World Series between the Tigers and Padres, he faced Goose Gossage, one of the game&#x27;s premier relievers, with Detroit up 5–4 and runners on second and third with one out. An intentional (or at least semi-intentional) walk seemed to be in order, especially because Gibson had already homered earlier in the game. However, Gossage told San Diego manager Dick Williams he thought he could strike him out. Indeed, Gossage had struck out Gibson in his very first Major League at-bat in 1979 on three pitches, and Kirk had only managed one bunt-single against Gossage in 10 previous plate appearances. When asked about Gibson, Gossage later said he had told teammate Tim Lollar in the second inning, &quot;I own him.&quot; If the Padres could hold the Tigers and score a couple runs in the ninth, they would force the Series back to San Diego and maybe turn the tide. In the &quot;Sounds of the Game&quot; video, Detroit manager Sparky Anderson was seen yelling at Gibson from the dugout, &quot;He don&#x27;t want to walk you!&quot;, showing four fingers and then making a bat-swinging motion, the universal baseball gesture for &quot;swing away.&quot; Gibson got the message and launched Gossage&#x27;s 1–0 fastball deep into Tiger Stadium&#x27;s right field upper deck for a three-run homer, icing the game and the Series for the Tigers.

During his 2008 Hall of Fame induction speech, Gossage turned to Williams and said with a smile, &quot;I should have walked Gibson.&quot; In the ESPN interview that aired after the induction ceremony, Williams took responsibility for the situation, as he allowed Gossage to talk him into pitching to Gibson. At the same time, Williams ribbed Gossage that Gibson&#x27;s home run damaged several seats &quot;in consecutive rows&quot;.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
In 1988, an arbitrator ruled that baseball team owners had colluded against the players in an effort to stem free agency. He granted several players, including Gibson, immediate free agency. Gibson signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Gibson joined the Dodgers in 1988, and immediately brought a winning attitude after a publicized blow-up when pitcher Jesse Orosco put shoe black in his cap during a spring training prank. Gibson openly criticized the team, which had finished fourth in the NL West the previous season, for its unprofessionalism. He became the team&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader, and won a controversial NL MVP award after batting .290 with 25 home runs, 76 RBIs, 106 runs, and 31 stolen bases. While he didn&#x27;t lead the league in any major category, the intensity and leadership he brought to an increasingly successful team likely won him the award over players with more impressive statistics. (MVP runner-up Darryl Strawberry of the New York Mets, for example, led the NL with 39 home runs that season.)

In the 1988 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, Gibson made an improbable catch in left field at a rain-soaked Shea Stadium in Game 3. Racing back, he slipped on the wet grass and, while on his way down with his knees on the ground and the rest of his body suspended, reached out and made a full extension catch to save a potential Mookie Wilson double; however, the Dodgers lost the game 8–4. In Game 4, his solo home run in the top of the 12th proved to be the winning hit. In Game 5, he hit a two-out three-run homer in the fifth; the Dodgers ended up winning the game 7–4. Nonetheless, his LCS heroics served as but a prelude to the career-defining moment that awaited him in the subsequent World Series.

====1988 World Series====

Gibson is perhaps best known for his one and only plate appearance in the 1988 World Series against the Oakland Athletics. Having injured both legs during the NLCS, Gibson was not expected to play at all. In Game 1, however, with the Dodgers trailing by a score of 4–3, Mike Davis on first base, and two out in the ninth inning, manager Tommy Lasorda unexpectedly inserted his hobbled league MVP as a pinch hitter. Gibson, limping back and forth between a pulled left hamstring and a swollen right knee, made his way to the plate to face Oakland&#x27;s future Hall of Fame closer Dennis Eckersley. Gibson quickly got behind in the count 0–2, but laid off of a pair of outside pitches that were called balls. He then kept the count at 2–2 by fouling off a pitch. On the seventh pitch of his at-bat, a ball, Davis stole second. With an awkward, almost casual swing, Gibson used pure upper-body strength—and according to Gibson, advanced scouting-based knowledge of what the pitcher would likely throw with that count—to smack a 3–2 backdoor slider over the right-field fence. He hobbled around the bases and pumped his right fist as his jubilant teammates stormed the field. The Dodgers won the game, 5–4, and won the World Series, four games to one.

===Later career===
In 1991, Gibson signed as a free agent with the Kansas City Royals, and then in 1992 he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Neal Heaton. He retired from baseball temporarily, after being released by the Pirates on May 5, 1992. A month later, Gibson got an offer to return to Detroit—not with the Tigers, but to play football again, with the Arena Football League&#x27;s Detroit Drive; he declined the offer. The following spring, Sparky Anderson convinced him to return to baseball. He spent the final three years of his career (1993–1995) back with the Tigers, including a renaissance season in 1994 when he hit 23 home runs in 98 games before the strike ended the season.

===Career statistics===
In 1,635 games over 17 seasons, Gibson posted a .268 batting average (1,553 for 5,798) with 985 runs, 260 doubles, 54 triples, 255 home runs, 870 RBI, 284 stolen bases, 718 bases on balls, a .352 on-base percentage and a .463 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .976 fielding percentage while playing at all three outfield positions. In 21 
postseason games, he batted .282 (22 for 78) with 13 runs, two doubles, seven home runs, 21 RBI, nine stolen bases and 12 walks.

===Post-playing career===
====Broadcasting====
Gibson was a Detroit Tigers television analyst on FSN Detroit for five seasons, from 1998 to 2002.

On February 10, 2015, it was announced that Gibson would return as a color commentator for the Detroit Tigers on Fox Sports Detroit, along with former teammate Jack Morris.

On January 28, 2019, Gibson was named a special assistant for the Detroit Tigers.

====Coaching====
In 2003, he was named the Tigers&#x27; bench coach by new Tigers manager and former Tigers teammate Alan Trammell. He served in that position until the midway point of the 2005 season when he was moved from bench coach to hitting coach, swapping positions with Bruce Fields. As of the start of the 2007 Major League Baseball season, Gibson became the new Arizona Diamondbacks bench coach.

Gibson had worn #23 as a player in both football at Michigan State and baseball throughout his career. However, while coaching for the Tigers, he wore #22 after #23 was retired for Willie Horton. Gibson wore #23 as manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks.

===Managerial career===
====Arizona Diamondbacks====

On July 1, 2010, the Arizona Diamondbacks fired A. J. Hinch as manager and promoted Gibson from his position as bench coach to interim manager. Shortly after the season, Gibson was named permanent manager and given a two-year contract. In his first full year as manager, Gibson led the Diamondbacks to their first N.L. West title since 2007, when most sports writers expected them to be in last place for the third time in a row. He was named NL Manager of the Year on November 16, 2011. On September 26, 2014, the Arizona Diamondbacks fired Gibson, ending his four-year tenure with the team. He finished his Diamondbacks career with a 353–375 regular season and 2–3 post–season record.

====Managerial record====

==Personal life==

Gibson married JoAnn Sklarski on December 22, 1985, in a double ceremony where Tiger pitcher Dave Rozema married JoAnn&#x27;s sister Sandy. They were married at Grosse Pointe Memorial Church in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. The Gibsons reside in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, and have four children: Colleen, Cam, Kirk, and Kevin. Gibson&#x27;s son Cam was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 5th round, 160th overall, in the 2015 Major League Baseball draft. His son Kevin is a defenseman for the Fort Wayne Komets in the ECHL.

Gibson set an aviation record in 1987. He flew a Cessna 206 to a height of 25,200 feet in Lakeland, Florida. The record was certified by the National Aeronautic Association.

He was nominated for induction into the College Football Hall of Fame multiple times before being elected in 2017.

Gibson is an avid deer hunter. He and former teammate David Wells, along with former MLB pitcher Jake Peavy, own a 1,300-acre hunting ranch near Millersburg, Michigan, which they named the &quot;Buck Falls Ranch&quot;.
On April 28, 2015, it was announced that Gibson had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="570128" wikidata="Q4691012" url="?curid=570128" title="Against All Enemies">
<text>Against All Enemies: Inside America&#x27;s War on Terror () is a 2004 award-winning book by former U.S. chief counter-terrorism advisor Richard A. Clarke, criticizing past and present presidential administrations for the way they handled the War on Terrorism. The book focused much of its criticism on President George W. Bush, charging that he failed to take sufficient action to protect the country in the elevated-threat period before the September 11 attacks and for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which Clarke feels greatly hampered the War on Terrorism. The book&#x27;s title comes from the oath of office taken by all U.S. federal officials (except the President), in which they promise to defend the Constitution &quot;against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&quot;

==Content==
Clarke argues that he made numerous urgent requests for a meeting about dealing with terrorism, had CIA Director George Tenet include numerous details about Al-Qaeda in daily briefings, found an unprecedented level of terrorist &quot;chatter&quot; before September 11.

Soon after 9/11, he says that defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld wanted to bomb Iraq, even though there was no evidence of their involvement, because they had more &quot;good targets&quot; than Afghanistan, which was actually involved.

Clarke also says that on September 12, 2001, President Bush asked him to try to find evidence that Saddam Hussein was connected to the terrorist attacks. In response he wrote a report stating there was absolutely no evidence of Iraqi involvement and got it signed by all relevant agencies (the FBI, the CIA, etc.). The paper was quickly returned by a deputy with a note saying &quot;Please update and resubmit,&quot; apparently unshown to the President.

Clarke also recalls a meeting where then Defense Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz expressed doubt that Osama bin Laden could have carried out the attacks on September 11 without state sponsorship. Clarke writes that Wolfowitz attempted to connect Saddam Hussein to the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993 — a theory based on the writings of Laurie Mylroie that, according to Clarke, has been exhaustively investigated and disproven.

But perhaps most damagingly, Clarke claims that the administration has done &quot;a terrible job&quot; fighting terrorism, even since September 11. In particular, he feels the 2003 invasion of Iraq played right into Osama bin Laden&#x27;s hands. For years, bin Laden had been producing propaganda saying that the US wants to invade and occupy an oil-rich middle eastern country, which was essentially validated by the US invasion of Iraq. As a result, says Clarke, it&#x27;s not surprising that Al-Qaeda and its offshoots are having much greater success recruiting new members.

Furthermore, he feels the war has taken resources from the more important fight: stopping Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and around the world. He points out that had his plan been followed when he first presented it, Al-Qaeda could have been essentially eliminated. But since his plan was not followed, and bin Laden was essentially ignored as the United States and allies invaded Iraq, Al-Qaeda has grown in strength and number, and is now going to be difficult to stop.

His statements seem to be backed up by Bob Woodward&#x27;s &quot;Bush at War&quot;, where he quotes Bush as saying &quot;I know (Osama bin Laden) was a menace... but I didn&#x27;t feel that sense of urgency.&quot; Clarke has been backed up by testimony of former Treasury Secretary Paul O&#x27;Neill, the National Security Council&#x27;s Flynt Leverett, and Clarke&#x27;s deputy, Roger Cressey.

Clarke also described many of these events in his almost 20 hours of testimony under oath before the 9/11 Commission, a portion in its public hearings.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine (April 2, 2007 p. 48) reported a movie script of the book has been written but not yet made.

==Responses from the Bush administration==
On March 22, 2004, Vice President Dick Cheney claimed that Clarke was &quot;out of the loop&quot; in the fight against terror. Condoleezza Rice later contradicted this, claiming the opposite: Clarke was the loop, so any failure in terrorism-preparedness was his. Later, in a direct response to Cheney&#x27;s statement, she said &quot;I would not use the word &#x27;out of the loop,&#x27;... He was in every meeting that was held on terrorism.&quot;

Press Secretary Scott McClellan claimed that Clarke timed the publication of his book in order to influence the upcoming election. Clarke pointed out that his book had been finished since the previous year; it was only released at that time because the White House took months to review it for classified information.

Some alleged that Clarke had published the book to win a spot in a possible John Kerry administration. Clarke responded by swearing under oath that he did not want another job in the government and would not accept one.

Others pointed to the fact that Clarke taught a class with Rand Beers, an advisor to John Kerry. Clarke explained that he was a long-time friend of Beers, who had also worked extensively in the government on counterterrorism for Bush and other administrations, and would not give up his friendship simply because his friend had a new job.

Another major criticism of Clarke was that he had been more supportive of the Bush administration when he worked there as a special advisor to the President. Fox News Channel released a transcript from an August 2002 briefing that Clarke gave to reporters while he was still working for the White House, as background (meaning not for attribution). In it Clarke says that &quot;there was no plan on al Qaeda that was passed from the Clinton administration to the Bush administration,&quot; and otherwise puts the Bush administration in a more favorable light. Questioned about this apparent inconsistency, Clarke said the differences were &quot;really a matter here of emphasis and tone. I mean, what you&#x27;re suggesting, perhaps, is that as special assistant to the president of the United States when asked to give a press backgrounder I should spend my time in that press backgrounder criticizing him. I think that&#x27;s somewhat of an unrealistic thing to expect.&quot;

==Disputed claims of Clarke&#x27;s book==

Journalist Walter Pincus points to a passage on page 237 in which Clarke describes a September 4, 2001 meeting of national security principals in which he states Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, &quot;who looked distracted throughout the session, took the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz line that there were other terrorists concerns, like Iraq.&quot; Rumsfeld has publicly stated he was not at the September 4, 2001 meeting, and Defense Department officials have stated he was not in attendance.

In his book &quot;My FBI&quot;, Louis Freeh writes: 
In his book, Clarke recounts a critical &quot;principals&quot; meeting close to the millennium celebration when Sandy Berger looked hard at Janet [Reno], George Tenet, and me, and said, &quot;We have stopped two sets of attacks planned for the millennium. You can bet your measly federal paycheck that there are more out there and we have to stop them too. I spoke with the President and he wants you all to know...this is it, nothing more important, all assets. We stop this (expletive).&quot;
According to Freeh, the passage was a &quot;nice tale, but I was never at such a meeting, and Sandy Berger never would have spoken like that in front of the attorney general.&quot; (page 298)

<doc id="570135" wikidata="Q713018" url="?curid=570135" title="Battle of Kapyong">
<text>The Battle of Kapyong (; 22–27 April 1951), also known as the Battle of Jiaping (), was fought during the Korean War between United Nations Command (UN) forces—primarily Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand—and the 118th and 60th Divisions of the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA). The fighting occurred during the Chinese Spring Offensive and saw the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade (27th Brigade) establish blocking positions in the Kapyong Valley, on a key route south to the capital, Seoul. The two forward battalions—the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) and 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI) were supported by guns from the 16th Field Regiment (16 NZFR) of the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery along with two companies of US mortars, fifteen Sherman tanks from US 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion, two companies of the US 74th Engineer Combat Battalion and 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment. These forces occupied positions astride the valley with hastily developed defences. As thousands of soldiers from the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) began to withdraw through the valley, the PVA infiltrated the brigade position under the cover of darkness, and assaulted the 3 RAR on Hill 504 during the evening and into the following day. Five companies of the US and UK forces attached to 27th Brigade fled the battlefield without orders, expecting an imminent PVA breakthrough at the Kapyong Valley.

Although heavily outnumbered, the 3 RAR and U.S. tanks held their positions into the afternoon of April 24 before they retreated from the battlefield to a reserve position near brigade headquarters, with both sides having suffered heavy casualties. The PVA then turned their attention to the surrounded 2 PPCLI on Hill 677, whose encirclement prevented any resupply or reinforcements from entering. The 2 PPCLI were ordered to make a last stand on Hill 677. During a fierce night battle on 24/25 April the PVA forces were unable to dislodge the 2 PPCLI and sustained enormous losses. The next day, the PVA withdrew back up the valley in order to regroup, and the 2 PPCLI were relieved late on 26 April. 

The fighting helped blunt the PVA Spring Offensive and the actions of the 2 PPCLI and 3 RAR at Kapyong were critical in preventing a breakthrough against the UN central front, the encirclement of US forces in Korea, which were at that point in general retreat, and ultimately, the capture of Seoul. The 2 PPCLI and 3 RAR battalions, consisting of about 700 men each, bore the brunt of the assault and stopped PVA divisional forces estimated at 20,000 in strength during the hard-fought defensive battle. Today, the battle is regarded as the most famous and significant action fought by the Canadian and Australian armies in Korea, and the most famous battle fought by the Canadian Armed Forces since WWII.

==Background==

===Military situation===
The UN counter-offensive between February and April 1951 had been largely successful, with the US Eighth Army pushing the PVA north of the Han River during Operation Killer, while Seoul was recaptured in mid-March during Operation Ripper and UN forces once again approached the 38th Parallel. Regardless, the strained relationship between UN commander General Douglas MacArthur and US President Harry S. Truman led to MacArthur&#x27;s dismissal as Commander-in-Chief, and his replacement by General Matthew B. Ridgway. 

Consequently, on 14 April 1951, General James Van Fleet replaced Ridgway as commander of the US Eighth Army and the UN forces in Korea. Ridgway flew to Tokyo the same day to replace MacArthur. Meanwhile, the offensive continued with a series of short thrusts. Operation Courageous, in late March, pushed forward to the &quot;Benton Line&quot;, south of the 38th Parallel, while Operation Rugged in early April pushed just north of the 38th Parallel to the &quot;Kansas Line&quot;. Finally, in mid-April a further advance moved the US Eighth Army to the &quot;Utah Line&quot;.

Following the Battle of Maehwa-San, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were assigned to a period in US IX Corps reserve as the UN forces had continued to push steadily northwards. By April 1951, the brigade consisted of four infantry battalions, one Australian, one Canadian and two British, including: the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment; 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry; 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment; and 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Brigadier Basil Coad had departed for Hong Kong on compassionate leave on 23 March and the brigade was now under the command of Brigadier Brian Burke. 

In direct support was the 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery (16 Fd Regt) with its 25-pounder field guns. 3 RAR was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Ferguson. 2 PPCLI was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Stone. Deployed in the central sector, the brigade was part of US IX Corps which also included the US 24th Infantry Division, ROK 2nd Infantry Division, US 7th Infantry Division and the ROK 6th Infantry Division, under the overall command of Major General William M. Hoge.
During this time, 27th Brigade was attached to the US 24th Division, advancing north through the Chojong valley in late March, reaching the &quot;Benton Line&quot; on 31 March. The brigade was then released, advancing with IX Corps up the deep and narrow valley of the Kapyong River, to the east. From 3 April, the 27th Brigade moved further up the river, advancing over the next 12 days as part of Operation Rugged. Although the valley was not held in strength by the PVA, it was skilfully defended by small groups of infantry dug-in on the hilltops that overlooked it. Advancing along the flanking hills and ridges, the brigade captured successive positions, while encountering heavy resistance before reaching the &quot;Kansas Line&quot; on 8 April. Following a brief operational pause, the advance to the &quot;Utah Line&quot; began on 11 April, the day after MacArthur&#x27;s dismissal. PVA resistance strengthened noticeably; as a result, the brigade&#x27;s initial objectives were not captured until 13 April.

The approach to the &quot;Utah Line&quot; was dominated by two hills—the &#x27;Sardine&#x27; feature north, and &#x27;Salmon&#x27;, a further north. A Middlesex company was repulsed twice in attempts to capture Sardine on 14 April, before the task was allocated to 3 RAR. A Company, 3 RAR subsequently captured the crest, killing 10 PVA and wounding another 20 for the loss of eight 3 RAR wounded. The following morning, Salmon was captured by C Company without firing a shot, amidst light resistance. PVA shelling after its capture resulted in two men wounded, while airstrikes then broke up an attempted PVA counter-attack. Meanwhile, 2 PPCLI continued their advance on the right flank, capturing the &#x27;Turbot&#x27; feature (Hill 795) on 15 April. Facing a spirited PVA delaying action on successive positions, the 2 PPCLI did not capture their final objective—the &#x27;Trout&#x27; feature (Hill 826)—until the following morning.

==Chinese Spring Offensive==

===Preparations===
After reaching the &quot;Utah Line&quot;, 27th Brigade was withdrawn from the front on 17 April, handing over its positions to the ROK 6th Division. Burke subsequently ordered his battalions into reserve positions north of the previously destroyed village of Kapyong, on the main road from Seoul to the east coast. Intelligence indicated that a new PVA offensive was imminent, and while the brigade settled in to rest, it remained on three hours&#x27; notice to move to support IX Corps. Having been on operations continuously for the past seven months, the 27th Brigade intended to relieve the bulk of its forces during its period in reserve. Two of the battalions—the Argylls and the Middlesex—would be replaced by two fresh battalions from Hong Kong. Advance parties from Brigade Headquarters and the Argylls departed for Seoul en route for Hong Kong on 19 April, while the remaining battalions were scheduled to depart two weeks later. 3 RAR would not be rotated and remained a part of the brigade for the entire war, operating on an individual reinforcement system instead.

Meanwhile, planning began for Operation Dauntless, a drive into the Iron Triangle—a key PVA/Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) concentration area and communications junction in the central sector between Chorwon and Kumwha in the south and Pyonggang in the north. Contingency planning also included precautions against a new major PVA offensive, in which the US Eighth Army would conduct a delaying defence on successive positions. Further indications of an imminent offensive—including the visible strengthening of PVA/KPA artillery and logistic systems—led Ridgway to order Van Fleet not to exploit any opportunities beyond the &quot;Wyoming Line&quot;. Confident nonetheless, Ridgway widened the scope of the offensive, designating a secondary objective line in the eastern sector known as the &quot;Alabama Line&quot;. Fate would intervene, however, and Van Fleet launched his offensive on 21 April only to be met by a much stronger PVA/KPA offensive the following night.

===Launch of Chinese Spring Offensive===

The Chinese Spring Offensive—also known as the Chinese Fifth Phase Campaign, First Impulse—envisioned the total destruction of US I and IX Corps above the Han River, involving three PVA Army Groups—the 3rd, 9th and 19th Army Groups—and three KPA Corps—the I, III and V Corps—under the overall command of Peng Dehuai. With the immediate objective of capturing Seoul, the offensive commenced on 22 April on two broad fronts: the main thrust across the Imjin River in the western sector held by the US I Corps, involving 337,000 troops driving towards Seoul, and the secondary effort involving 149,000 troops attacking further east across the Soyang River in the central and eastern sectors, falling primarily on US IX Corps, and to a lesser extent, on US X Corps&#x27; sector. A further 214,000 PVA troops supported the offensive; in total more than 700,000 men. As part of the preparation, the battle-hardened 39th and 40th Armies of the 13th Army Group were transferred to the 9th Army Group under the overall command of Song Shi-Lun, and Commander Wen Yuchen of the 40th Army was given the mission of destroying the ROK 6th Division while blocking any UN reinforcements towards the Imjin River at Kapyong.

Facing the offensive were 418,000 UN troops, including 152,000 ROK, 245,000 Americans, 11,500 British Commonwealth and 10,000 troops from other UN countries. However, with the US Eighth Army not strong enough to prevent large penetrations along its line, masses of PVA infantry soon swept around its flanks, surrounding entire formations in an attempt to cut off their withdrawal. Standing directly in the path of the main PVA attack towards Seoul in the I Corps sector was the 29th British Brigade. The brigade&#x27;s stand on the Imjin River held off two PVA divisions for two days and ultimately helped prevent the capture of Seoul, but resulted in heavy casualties in one of the bloodiest British engagements of the war. The 29th Brigade suffered 1,091 casualties in their defence of the &quot;Kansas Line&quot;, and they destroyed a large portion of the PVA 63rd Army and inflicted nearly 10,000 casualties. Meanwhile, further east, in the IX Corps sector, the PVA 118th Division, 40th Army and the 60th Division, 20th Army prepared to attack the ROK 6th Division on the night of 22 April.

===South Korean withdrawal, 22–23 April 1951===

The ROK were holding positions at the northern end of the Kapyong Valley, having advanced since relieving the 27th Brigade. However, anticipating a PVA attack, the divisional commander—General Chang Do Yong—had halted his advance at 16:00 and ordered his two forward regiments—the 19th and the 2nd Infantry Regiments—to tie-in and develop defensive positions. Meanwhile, the 7th Infantry Regiment occupied reserve positions immediately behind the forward regiments. The ROK 6th Division had been bolstered by the attachment of 16 NZFR and a battery of M101 howitzers from the US 213th Field Artillery Battalion. Regardless, left with only one hour to halt its advance and step up defences, the forward ROK units were only able to occupy a series of hill-top positions while leaving the valleys and flanks exposed. 

Two PVA divisions—the 118th and the 60th Division—struck at 17:00, easily infiltrating through numerous gaps between the badly organised defensive positions. Under pressure all along the front, the defenders gave ground almost immediately and soon broke. Abandoning their weapons, equipment, and vehicles, they disintegrated and began to stream south out of the mountains and through the valley, and by 23:00, Chang was forced to admit that he had lost all communication with his units. At 04:00, the decision was made to withdraw 16 NZFR to prevent their loss. However, following reports that the ROK were making a stand, they were ordered back up the valley the next morning with the Middlesex accompanying them as protection. By dusk, it was clear that the ROK units had collapsed, and the guns were withdrawn again.

Meanwhile, the US 1st Marine Division was holding firm against the PVA 39th Army to the east, and the withdrawal of the ROK had left their flank exposed. However, with the PVA 39th and 40th Armies only tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the 9th Army Group against possible counterattacks from the 1st Marine Division, the PVA did not exploit this opportunity and the US forces remained relatively unmolested. Yet with the forward UN positions in both the US I Corps and US IX Corps sectors increasingly untenable as the PVA exploited gaps between formations, Van Fleet ordered a withdrawal to the &quot;Kansas Line&quot; in the mid-morning. 

Hoge subsequently ordered the US Marines to form a new defensive position beyond the Pukhan River, between the Hwachon Reservoir and the new position to be occupied by the ROK 6th Division. Hoge&#x27;s plan relied on the ROK reforming and offering some resistance, and although a rearguard of 2,500 men was belatedly established, it was in no condition to fight. Fearing a breakthrough, Hoge ordered the 27th Brigade, as the corps&#x27; reserve, to establish defensive positions north of Kapyong on the afternoon of 23 April as a precaution in the event the ROK were unable to hold, tasking them with blocking the two approaches to the village and to prevent the PVA from cutting Route 17, a key route south to Seoul and an important main supply route.
The brigade was by now reduced to three battalions, as the Argylls had been withdrawn to Pusan just prior to the battle, in preparation for their embarkation. The Middlesex were also on stand-by for embarkation and were kept in reserve. As such, with the width of the valley precluding the establishment of a continuous linear defensive line, Burke was forced to place his two available battalions on the high points on either side of it, with 3 RAR occupying Hill 504 to the east of the river and 2 PPCLI occupying Hill 677 to the west. Meanwhile, Sudok San (Hill 794) to the north-west—a massive hill nearly high—was left undefended by necessity. Together, these three hills formed a naturally strong defensive position, well-suited to blocking a major advance. 

Regardless, the brigade position suffered from a number of deficiencies, being exposed without flank protection, while the central sector was not occupied because the Middlesex were away to the north with the guns. Likewise, until the return of 16 NZFR, the Brigade would have little artillery support. As such, if large PVA forces arrived before these two units returned, the forward companies would be without support and would have to accept the probability that they would be cut-off. 3 RAR—whose line of communications ran through the exposed central sector of the valley—would be particularly exposed.

Each of the battalions were deployed across the summits and slopes in separate company-sized defensive positions, creating a series of strong-points across a front. Due to the large amount of ground to be defended, each of the companies were spread widely, and were unable to offer mutual support. Instead, each platoon would support each other, with each company adopting all-round defence. Brigade Headquarters remained in the valley, to the south. With 16 NZFR still forward supporting the ROK, US IX Corps placed a battery of howitzers from the US 213th Field Artillery Battalion and the twelve M2 mortars of B Company, 2nd Chemical Mortar Battalion, under the command of 27th Brigade. Fifteen Sherman tanks from A Company, US 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion, were also in support. Also attached to the Brigade were two companies of the US 74th Engineer Combat Battalion who bivouacked on the hills nearby the 3 RAR positions.

The 2 PPCLI subsequently occupied Hill 677 and began digging-in, deploying their six Vickers machine guns in sections to add depth, and using defensive fire tasks to cover the gaps in their positions. Meanwhile, the 3 RAR occupied Hill 504, with D Company holding the summit itself, A Company the spur-line which ran down to the north-west, and B Company the small hill by the river, while C Company was in reserve on the rear spur. In response to US IX Corps&#x27; requirements, Burke directed Ferguson to site his headquarters in the low ground of the valley in the vicinity of the hamlet of Chuktun-ni, so as to control the withdrawing ROK. However, this would limit Ferguson&#x27;s situational awareness and his ability to control the battle, while also leaving them exposed to infiltration. The afternoon was spent on the lightly scrub-covered slopes digging-in and building sangars where the rocky ground proved too hard. In only a few hours, the 3 RAR managed to prepare defensive positions, although defensive fire tasks were unable to be registered as the artillery forward observers were unable to reach the company positions until after dark.
The US tank company commander—Lieutenant Kenneth W. Koch—deployed his platoons in support of the 3 RAR. The road skirted the eastern flank of Hill 504, and it offered the best area for the employment of armour. One platoon of five tanks occupied a northern outpost position forward of B Company to prevent the PVA using the road; another platoon occupied the high ground to the west, with B Company; while the final platoon and Koch&#x27;s command tank was deployed near battalion headquarters, covering a ford by which the road crossed the Kapyong River, approximately south of B Company. The tanks were deployed without infantry support. The command relationship between the 3 RAR and their armoured support was also complicated, as the US tanks were not under command as they might normally have been. Rather, Koch was free to conduct his own battle. Regardless, armed with a cannon and one .50 caliber and two 30 caliber machine guns, the Sherman tanks were formidable assets and bolstered the defence considerably. In contrast, the PVA had no tanks at Kapyong, while their infantry had only a few anti-tank rockets with which to counter them.

By 20:00 that evening, a large number of ROK were retreating in disarray through a gap in the line held by the brigade, the majority of them moving through the 3 RAR positions. The ROK 6th Division later regrouped in positions behind 27th Brigade, but was now reduced to less than half its original strength. Meanwhile, as the 20th Army veered to the west as part of the PVA main effort against Seoul, the PVA 118th Division and 60th Division continued a secondary advance down the Kapyong Valley, closely pursuing the retreating ROK. Racing down the north-east-running valley, the 354th Regiment reached the 3 RAR positions by about 22:00. Intent on capturing the important crossroads of Route 17 south of Kapyong, and most likely unaware of the location of the Australian blocking position, the PVA vanguard remained in the low ground, splitting as they approached a long, low north–south running ridge that rose like an island in the mouth of the valley.

==Australian 3 RAR defence of Hill 504, 23–24 April 1951==

===Night battle===

Having successfully prevented the US 1st Marine Division from reinforcing the Imjin River front, the PVA 40th Army turned its attention towards the 27th Brigade on 23 April. The battle started during the night of 23/24 April, and continued until late in the day on 27 April, as the PVA 118th Division and 60th Division, totaling perhaps 20,000 men under the command of Deng Yue—engaged the two forward battalions of 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. The initial PVA attack at Kapyong engaged the 700 men of 3 RAR on Hill 504, while in the early part of the battle, the Middlesex and 16 NZFR gunners were all but cut off. However, the resistance of the 3 RAR ultimately allowed them to safely withdraw from the battlefield and the Middlesex then moved into a reserve position astride the western bank of the river. The PVA 60th Division and two battalions of the PVA 354th Regiment launched repeated attacks on the two forward 3 RAR companies on the north-west spur of Hill 504. Assaults of massed PVA troops kept up the attack throughout the night, but the defence of the 3 RAR on the brigade&#x27;s right flank held them back until the 3 RAR was forced to retreat to Brigade HQ on the 24th. The PVA would then turn their attention to the 700 soldiers of the 2 PPCLI the following day.

Using the retreating ROK troops to cover their movements, the PVA had infiltrated the brigade position in the initial stages of the battle, penetrating between A and B Companies, 3 RAR astride the road, and largely surrounding the latter before moving into the rear positions. The 3 RAR soldiers struggled to distinguish the PVA from the ROK in the dark, although the Korean Service Corps porters attached to the battalion were able to provide valuable assistance to the defenders distinguishing the PVA by the sounds of their voices. At 21:30, the PVA launched their first attack on the forward platoon of US tanks, which had been posted on the road without infantry support. The initial moves were easily repelled. However, a stronger attack an hour later forced the tanks to withdraw after two of the tank commanders were killed, including the platoon commander. The PVA then proceeded to assault the 3 RAR on two different axes: one against the two forward companies in front of Hill 504, and the other through the valley astride the road around battalion headquarters. Finally, by 23:00, 16 NZFR artillery had returned to the brigade, although they provided only limited support throughout the rest of the night.

Probes began on the A and B Company positions, and a number of assaults occurred during the night. Utilising indirect fires, the PVA charged forward in waves, only to be beaten back by the 3 RAR&#x27;s Bren light machine guns, Owen submachine guns, rifle fire and grenades, before again regrouping and attacking again. B Company—under the command of Captain Darcy Laughlin—supported by tanks, drove off each assault, inflicting heavy casualties while emerging almost unscathed. Laughlin&#x27;s command post was fired upon by a number of PVA that had infiltrated the company position, but they were swiftly driven out. An outpost on the northern knoll reported PVA massing on their flanks at 23:00, and although heavy artillery was directed against the attackers, the section was forced to break contact and withdraw to the main defensive position. The main PVA assault began at 00:50, falling on 4 Platoon but was broken up after an hour of heavy fighting. A second assault was mounted on 6 Platoon at 03:30, following a feint against 5 Platoon. With determination, the PVA swept forward, penetrating the 6 Platoon perimeter before being ejected by an equally determined counter-attack by 6 Platoon with Sherman tanks in support. At 04:00, a small outpost to the rear of the company position was attacked by more than 50 PVA. Held by just four men under the command of Lance Corporal Ray Parry, the 3 RAR fought off four separate attacks, killing more than 25 and wounding many more over the space of twenty minutes. Parry was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions. A final assault on B Company was made just at dawn at 04:45 by about 70 PVA, and was again repulsed.

Further up the ridge, A Company—under Major Ben O&#x27;Dowd—faced a tougher task, and came under heavy attack. The first probes began at 21:30, targeting 1 Platoon, which was the lowest of the three platoons on the west flank. The initial moves were then followed up by major PVA assaults from three sides over the next three hours. Despite suffering many casualties, the PVA continued their attack, closing in and attacking 1 Platoon with hand grenades. 1 Platoon also suffered numerous casualties, with more than half the platoon killed or wounded, including all three Bren gunners. Fighting back with small arms fire, they held against repeated assaults, which increased in frequency and strength as the PVA assaulted. By 01:00, O&#x27;Dowd ordered the survivors of 1 Platoon to withdraw through Company Headquarters into a new position in-between 2 and 3 Platoons. The PVA attacks then continued against 3 Platoon, lasting until 04:30, although they were not made with the same weight as the previous assaults.

Meanwhile, the 16 NZFR gunline had also been probed during the early morning and 16 NZFR was forced to redeploy at 03:00 to a position away, behind 27th Brigade HQ. The two US mortar companies simply fled on foot before midnight without firing a single round, abandoning their mortars, weapons and 50 trucks full of ammunition and supplies to the PVA. These US units found a minor road and hiked east to Chunchon before resting.

By dawn, it was clear that the PVA had succeeded in penetrating the perimeter through a gap between the 3 RAR platoons, and they began to engage them with machine guns from a defilade position covered from fire by a steep dip in the ridgeline, and concealed by thick scrub. In the growing light, 1 and 3 Platoon were soon pinned down and suffered a number of casualties as they attempted to gain better fire positions with which to engage their attackers. At 06:00, a fighting patrol was dispatched to make contact with Company Headquarters, and as the section passed over a false crest on their way down the spur line, they encountered the PVA positions by chance. Attacking immediately, six PVA were killed for the loss of one 3 RAR, and the threat to A Company was eliminated. O&#x27;Dowd then launched a counter-attack with 3 Platoon, assaulting the PVA occupying the original 1 Platoon position. By 07:00, they had regained the feature and the PVA were forced to withdraw under heavy fire from the 3 RAR platoons on the high ground, who again exacted a heavy toll. The night&#x27;s fighting had cost A Company dearly, however, and among the dead were the two 16 NZFR forward observers. In total, they suffered more than 50 casualties—half their original strength. Meanwhile, on the right flank, D Company—under Captain Norm Gravener—held the summit of Hill 504 and was not heavily engaged during the night, while C Company—commanded by Captain Reg Saunders—was attacked only once.

Located to the rear, Battalion Headquarters found itself heavily pressed, however. Protected by a section of Vickers machine guns, two 17-pounder anti-tank guns, the Assault Pioneer Platoon, and the Regimental Police under the Headquarters Company commander—Captain Jack Gerke, plus Koch&#x27;s own commanding tank platoon—the fighting flared around 22:00 as the PVA infiltrated the position among the retreating ROK. They bypassed the headquarters and the US tanks nearby, surrounding the defenders and establishing blocking positions on the road to the south. During the night, the PVA attempted to mount the tanks and destroy them with grenades and satchel charges, but were driven off by fire. Later, one of the tanks received a direct hit from a 3.5 inch rocket, while the forward perimeter was struck heavily by attacking waves of PVA, and was forced back with heavy casualties. Receiving fire from PVA soldiers occupying several houses in the village of Chuktun-ni, the Shermans engaged the roadblock and several houses, killing more than 40 PVA in one house alone.

There was a sudden and fundamental restructuring among the 3 RAR command personnel at this point in the battle. At dawn of 24 April, the PVA intensified their attack on the 3 RAR battalion headquarters&#x27; perimeter, killing and wounding the bulk of the Medium Machine Gun section and the Assault Pioneer Platoon and driving them off the higher ground they had been occupying, although A Company remained in full command of the hill. At this point, Ferguson requested further reinforcements from Burke, and at 04:00 Burke ordered a Middlesex company forward in support of Ferguson&#x27;s battalion HQ. However, on encountering some PVA resistance in the hills edging the Kapyong road, the Middlesex company suddenly decided to abandon their ordered assignment. They then turned east and escaped the battlefield using the same minor road discovered earlier by the US mortar companies during their escape. By 05:00, following the inexplicable disappearance of the Middlesex company, Ferguson was concerned that the PVA from the direction of the hill could eventually develop the potential to fire towards battalion headquarters. Ferguson made the decision to withdraw away from the battlefield to a new position to the rear, inside the Middlesex perimeter. However, Ferguson did not communicate with his company commanders regarding his decision to relocate, and O&#x27;Dowd and other officers were surprised in the morning to find that Ferguson had apparently disappeared. With Ferguson&#x27;s departure from his field HQ, O&#x27;Dowd, as the senior company commander, assumed field command of 3 RAR, which Ferguson confirmed to O&#x27;Dowd by radio communication. Ferguson&#x27;s absence from the battlefield and the intermittent nature of communications with his field officers made it increasingly difficult for him to communicate, monitor, and control his units on the battlefield.

Ferguson led his battalion HQ staff in the departure between 05:15 and 06:00, escorted by some of the US tanks. However, difficulties ensued with Ferguson&#x27;s personal vehicles. A PVA mortar round blew the wheel off of Ferguson&#x27;s own jeep, which was abandoned, while the tanks opened fire and drove off the attackers. Ferguson&#x27;s subsequent vehicle, a converted two-and-a-half tonne truck, became bogged down during the withdrawal and had to be destroyed.

The two companies of the US 74th Engineer Combat Battalion encamped adjacent to 3 RAR on the hillside had witnessed Ferguson&#x27;s departure. Mistaking his movement as a general retreat, they fled the battlefield on foot, abandoning their trucks and equipment.

During Ferguson&#x27;s withdrawal, two 3 RAR soldiers were left behind and were subsequently captured by the PVA. Signaller Private Horace Madden was later posthumously awarded the George Cross, following his death from malnutrition and ill-treatment.

Captain Gerke, in charge of 3 RAR battalion HQ defence, was unaware that Ferguson had removed himself and his staff from the battlefield, and was searching for Ferguson around the battlefield area, concerned about his disappearance. At 06:00, Gerke was approached by a jeep from Ferguson&#x27;s new HQ location, who announced, &quot;Bug-out! Battalion HQ is back down the road.&quot; Gerke ordered his men to withdraw gradually, moving one vehicle at a time back along the road, as those that remained provided covering fire. The departure was successfully completed, and with 3 RAR Headquarters Company finally assembled inside the Middlesex perimeter, Gerke was then ordered to secure a key ford across the Kapyong River, east, as a possible withdrawal route for the battalion should it later have to retire from Hill 504.

Communications between Ferguson&#x27;s 3 RAR HQ and Burke&#x27;s 27th Brigade HQ had failed early, while communications between Ferguson&#x27;s HQ and the 3 RAR forward companies were also poor. This was mostly due to the large number of ROK retreating through their position, tearing out the line from the 3 RAR HQ, as well the effect of heavy vehicle traffic and gunfire on the exposed line. Likewise, direct radio communication with the forward companies on the 3 RAR command net with the new Type 31 VHF radios was obstructed by the rugged terrain due to the siting of 3 RAR headquarters in low ground relative to the forward companies and the requirement for line-of-sight. The forward companies were able to maintain communications with each other, but not with Ferguson&#x27;s headquarters, while the company level nets also functioned well. Ultimately, contact was maintained between Ferguson and Burke through a radio set in the Middlesex Battalion Headquarters, while messages to O&#x27;Dowd and the forward companies engaged on the battlefield relied on line and a slow relay through C Company. These issues had only further complicated the conduct of the defence on the first night, with the co-ordination of the battlefield arrangements falling to O&#x27;Dowd, who had now assumed field command of 3 RAR. The next morning, O&#x27;Dowd finally managed to get through on a radio phone to a general in the US 1st Marine Division. The officer was incredulous, thinking it was a PVA agent speaking. He told O&#x27;Dowd that the 3 RAR no longer existed and that it had been wiped out the night before. O&#x27;Dowd replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve got news for you. We&#x27;re still here and we&#x27;re staying here.&quot;

The PVA attacks had been launched quickly and aggressively, placing their light machine guns on the flank in support and attempting to close to attack the 3 RAR perimeter with grenades. Contrary to some contemporary western accounts, the PVA did not use human wave tactics. Rather, using a tactic known as &#x27;one-point-two sides&#x27;, they used massed forces and infiltration to achieve local numerical superiority and to penetrate the gaps between the forward companies, before attempting to envelop the 3 RAR while drawing their fire to the front, away from their threatened flanks. They would normally attempt to close with UN defensive positions using darkness or poor visibility to cover their movement and to counter US air superiority, before attacking using massed force, coordinated with close fire support. However, although normally well-planned and closely supported by machine-gun, mortar, and artillery fire, PVA attacks in Korea were often inflexible in execution once launched. This was mostly due to the lack of radio communications below battalion-level, with the PVA instead relying on whistle blasts, bugle calls, and runners for command and control, and although their and mortars had provided particularly effective indirect fire support, these problems were again evident during the fighting at Kapyong. Later, it was estimated that more than 500 PVA were killed by the 3 RAR and the US tanks that supported them.

===Day battle===

As daylight broke, 16 NZFR were now in place to offer artillery support and the PVA found themselves highly exposed in the open ground in front of the 3 RAR. A and B Company, supported by artillery, mortars, and tanks, directed heavy fire towards the PVA positions, forcing them to withdraw, leaving hundreds of casualties behind on the slopes. With the 3 RAR remaining in possession of their original defensive locations, the immediate situation had stabilised, although they were now effectively cut-off behind the front. Ammunition, food, and medical supplies were now extremely low throughout the forward area and with casualty evacuation increasingly difficult, the battalion was at risk of being overrun unless it could be concentrated, resupplied and supported. As such, in order to avoid each company being isolated and overwhelmed in a series of PVA attacks, at 07:15 B Company was ordered to leave its position and join the other companies on the high ground to form a defendable battalion position. B Company subsequently withdrew as instructed, taking several dozen PVA prisoners with them that had been captured earlier by a standing patrol.16 NZFR covered their movement across the open valley, laying a smoke screen to conceal the withdrawal, while the US tanks also provided support. As they moved across the valley, B Company exchanged a number of shots with small groups of PVA who were still hiding in dead ground and in the riverbed, and saw numerous dead from the fighting the previous night. One hundred and seventy-three dead PVA were counted on the B Company perimeter by the 3 RAR before they departed.

With B Company successfully occupying its new positions, Ferguson returned forward to the hillside below his forward companies as a passenger inside a Sherman tank, which afforded protection from small arms fire. During the drive back from his new battalion HQ position, Ferguson found himself assisting in the loading of the tank machine guns when necessary to return fire at the enemy. Just after 09:00, a group of PVA launched an attack at the top of the spur held by C Company. The attack was repulsed, and no further assaults were made against C Company during the day, although they endured sniper fire and mortar bombardment for several hours.

With Burke now realising the importance of B Company&#x27;s previous position to a planned counter-offensive, two hours after their withdrawal, Ferguson ordered Laughlin to re-occupy the position which they had just vacated. Ferguson summoned O&#x27;Dowd to meet him at the former battalion HQ area and advised him that Burke had ordered B Company to return to the hill they had vacated. 27th Brigade was now expecting to be reinforced by 5th U.S. Cavalry Regiment, and their move forward would possibly be facilitated if the PVA were cleared from the small hill that commanded the road through the valley. Likewise, the defence of this position the previous evening had prevented a PVA assault on the western flank of Hill 504. As such, at 09:30 the order to withdraw was rescinded and B Company was tasked to re-occupy the position. In preparation for the company assault on the summit, Laughlin tasked 5 Platoon to assault a small knoll halfway between C Company and the old B Company position. A frontal assault was launched at 10:30, with two sections attacking and one in fire support. Strongly held by a PVA platoon well dug-in in bunkers, the defenders allowed the 5 Platoon to approach to within before opening fire with machine guns, rifles, and grenades. 5 Platoon suffered seven casualties, including the platoon commander, and they were forced to withdraw under the cover of machine-gun and mortar fire.

4 Platoon, under Lieutenant Leonard Montgomerie, took over the attack, while a number of US tanks moved in to provide further support. Conducting a right flanking attack, 4 Platoon suffered a number of casualties as they moved across the open ground. Advancing to within of the forward trenches, the PVA fire increased. Montgomerie launched a desperate bayonet charge, while a section under Corporal Donald Davie broke in on the right. Amid fierce hand-to-hand fighting, 4 Platoon cleared the PVA from the trenches, losing three men. Davie&#x27;s section was then heavily engaged by machine guns from the rear trenches, and he moved quickly to assault these with his remaining men. Montgomerie reorganised the platoon, and they fought from trench to trench using bayonets and grenades. 4 Platoon then began taking fire from another knoll to their front and, leaving his rear sections to clear the first position, Montgomerie led Davie&#x27;s section onto the second knoll. Against such aggression the PVA were unable to hold and, although the majority fought to the death, others fled across the open ground. By 12:30, the knoll had been captured by 4 Platoon, with 57 PVA dead counted on the first position and another 24 on the second.

However, a large PVA force was now detected occupying the old B Company position and 4 Platoon was effectively halted halfway to the objective. Before Laughlin could prepare his next move, he was ordered to withdraw by Ferguson, who was relaying orders from Burke pursuant to a new appraisal of the situation, and the attempted assault to dislodge the PVA and recover the hill was abandoned. O&#x27;Dowd attributed the failure of the assault to Ferguson&#x27;s plan of attack, which had neglected to include artillery support from the 16 NZFR for the infantry.

Ferguson then withdrew from the area in the US tank and returned to his new HQ to the rear of the battlefield. During the fighting, the tanks had provided invaluable support, moving ammunition forward to B Company, and helping to evacuate the wounded. The entire operation had cost the 3 RAR three killed and nine wounded. For his actions, Montgomerie was awarded the Military Cross, while Davie received the Military Medal.

Meanwhile, the PVA shifted their attention to D Company, launching a series of relentless assaults against the summit. D Company&#x27;s position was vital to the defence of Hill 504, commanding the high ground and protecting the 3 RAR right flank. Commencing at 07:00, the PVA assaulted the forward platoon—12 Platoon, launching attacks at 30 minute intervals until 10:30. Using mortars to cover their movement, they attacked on a narrow front up the steep slope using grenades. However, 12 Platoon beat the PVA back, killing more than 30 for the loss of seven wounded during six attacks. 16 NZFR again played a key role in defeating the PVA attempts, bringing down accurate fire within of the 12 Platoon positions. However, throughout the fighting, the supply of ammunition for the guns had caused severe problems, as the PVA offensive had depleted the stock of 25-pounder rounds available forward of the airhead in Seoul. Despite improvements, problems with the logistic system remained and each round had to be used effectively in response to the directions of the artillery forward observers who controlled their fire. Although badly wounded, Corporal William Rowlinson was later awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his leadership, while Private Ronald Smith was awarded the Military Medal. Lance Corporal Henry Richey was posthumously mentioned in dispatches after being fatally wounded attempting to evacuate the last of the 12 Platoon casualties.

Despite their previous failures, the PVA launched another series of attacks from 11:30 and these attacks continued for the next two hours, again targeting 12 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant John Ward. Failing to break through again, the PVA suffered heavy casualties before the assault ended. From 13:30, there was another lull in the fighting for an hour and a half, although D Company continued to endure PVA mortar, machine-gun, and rifle fire. Believing that the battle may continue into the night, Gravener made the decision to pull 12 Platoon back in order to adopt a tighter company perimeter, lest his forward platoon be overrun and destroyed. The movement was completed without incident and, shortly after, the newly-vacated position was assaulted by a large PVA force which had failed to detect the withdrawal. The PVA moved quickly as they attempted to establish their position on the northern end of the ridge, only to be heavily engaged by 3 RAR machine-gun and rifle fire, and artillery.

Burke&#x27;s 27th Brigade HQ was reinforced on the afternoon of 24 April by the arrival of two battalions of the US 5th Cavalry Regiment. These had been dispatched earlier in the day to the Brigade, and one of the battalions was subsequently deployed to the southwest of Hill 677 in order to cover the Brigade HQ left flank. A second US battalion occupied a position across the river, southeast of the Middlesex, providing cover for Brigade HQ right flank. Likewise, despite heavy casualties in one of the 3 RAR companies and battalion headquarters, 3 RAR would emerge from the intense battle largely intact and would successfully withdraw to Brigade HQ. Meanwhile, one of the replacement British battalions, the 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, had also arrived during the 24th and it took up positions with the 3 RAR around Brigade Headquarters. However, these forces collected near Brigade HQ would not attempt to engage the PVA or to form a relief column to attempt to break the PVA control of access to the supply trail from Tungmudae for the embattled and surrounded Hill 677, as Burke would inform the 2 PCCLI on the evening of 24 April.

===3 RAR withdraws===
Although originally intent on holding until the 3 RAR could be relieved by the 5th Cavalry Regiment, Burke had decided during the morning to withdraw 3 RAR from Hill 504 and retreat to 27th Brigade HQ. This decision had prompted Burke to cancel B Company&#x27;s assault. With the 3 RAR facing the potential of an eventual encirclement, Burke had ordered a withdrawal back to the Middlesex area to new defensive positions in the rear of the brigade. Indeed, despite holding the PVA at bay throughout the morning and afternoon, the increasing difficulty of resupply and casualty evacuation made it clear that the 3 RAR would be unable to hold Hill 504 for another night in its exposed and isolated positions. O&#x27;Dowd began planning for the withdrawal as the PVA renewed their assault on D Company around 11:30, and after Ferguson ordered O&#x27;Dowd to plan and lead the withdrawal by radio at 12:30. Stone on Hill 677 overheard on the radio net Ferguson order O&#x27;Dowd, &quot;..withdraw as best you can to the Middlesex positions, I can no longer keep control.&quot; With the PVA dominating the road south, O&#x27;Dowd ordered his companies to withdraw along a ridge running south-west from Hill 504, just east of the Kapyong River. The Middlesex position lay a further south-west of the foot of the ridge and could be reached by the ford secured earlier by Gerke, which would act as the battalion check point for the withdrawal. Ferguson saw his role as representing 3 RAR at Brigade HQ, and had, as such, decided to not move forward to lead the withdrawal himself.

Command of A Company was temporarily handed over to the second-in-command, Captain Bob Murdoch. Present at the Battle of Pakchon in November 1950, O&#x27;Dowd understood first-hand the dangers of withdrawing while in contact. The challenge was to protect the forward platoons as they withdrew from being followed up by the PVA occupying the old B Company positions and from D Company&#x27;s position after they broke contact. The 3 RAR would also have to clear the withdrawal route of any blocking forces, while at the same time, the evacuation of a large number of wounded and PVA prisoners would hamper their movement. As such, the timing of the withdrawal would be critical to its success. Consequently, the lead company would not move until mid-afternoon so that the rearguard would be able to use the protection of darkness to break contact, while at the same time offering good observation and fields of fire during the daylight to support the initial moves. Orders were delivered at 14:30. B Company would lead the withdrawal down the ridge line, carrying any wounded that still required evacuation, as well as clearing the route and securing the ford near the Middlesex position. C Company would wait for the artillery to neutralise the PVA on the old B Company position, before moving to establish a blocking position behind D Company. A Company would then withdraw to a blocking position behind C Company, in order to allow Gravener and Saunders to establish a clean break. Finally, D Company would withdraw through both C and A Company and set up a blocking position to delay any follow up and allow those companies to withdraw.
After 15:00, an airstrike was called in to dislodge the surviving PVA in front of D Company. However, the attack by two US Marine Corps F4U Corsairs was mistakenly directed at D Company themselves after their positions were wrongly marked by the spotter plane. Two men were killed and several badly burnt by napalm before the attack was broken off after the company second-in-command—Captain Michael Ryan—ran out under PVA fire waving a marker panel. The company medical orderly—Private Ronald Dunque—was subsequently awarded the Military Medal for his efforts assisting the wounded despite his own injuries. The PVA quickly attempted to exploit the chaos, moving against D Company&#x27;s long exposed eastern flank. 11 Platoon on the main ridge forward of the summit was subjected to a frontal assault. However, unaffected by the napalm, they broke up the PVA attack and inflicted heavy casualties on them. Regardless, further PVA attempts to infiltrate the 3 RAR positions continued into the afternoon.

The withdrawal was scheduled to begin shortly following the misdirected airstrike, and was to be preceded by an artillery bombardment with high explosive and smoke at 16:00. The US tanks were subsequently moved forward to provide cover, and when 16 NZFR artillery failed to fire at the appointed hour, they provided direct fire support. Still in contact, the 3 RAR began to pull back, fighting a number of well-disciplined rearguard actions as the companies leapfrogged each other. Meanwhile, 16 NZFR kept the PVA at bay, after it finally commenced firing. B Company had taken 39 PVA prisoners during the earlier fighting, and unable to leave these behind, they were used to carry many of the 3 RAR wounded and much of their equipment as well. O&#x27;Dowd&#x27;s fear that the PVA might have blocked the withdrawal route was not realised, and B Company moved back along the ridge and down to the ford without incident, reaching the Middlesex area after dark. C Company was the next to withdraw, departing at 16:30, just after suffering another casualty from sniper fire. Saunders led his company up the spur and then south down the main ridge without incident, followed by A Company during the next hour with the PVA in close pursuit.

Murdoch had been concerned lest he and his men should be engaged when they reached the Kapyong River in an exhausted condition and with little ammunition. The 3 RAR were fortunate, and due to difficulties of communication and navigation along the ridge line in the dark, elements of A Company had become separated and the last two platoons descended to the river too early to strike the ford. However, reaching a deserted part of the bank, they realised their mistake and immediately turned west again, following the river-bank to the ford. The PVA did not follow this sudden final turn and plunged on into the river, giving A Company an unexpected opportunity to break free. The pursuing PVA soldiers were subsequently detected by Stone and 2 PPCLI B Company on Hill 677 and were fired on. Fortunately for the 3 RAR, the 2 PPCLI heavy machine gun fire was accurately directed onto the PVA pursuers and did not hit them. The possibility of 2 PPCLI supporting fire had been foreseen earlier; however, problems with the radio relay between the 3 RAR and 2 PPCLI meant that there had been no guarantee that the withdrawing force would not be mistaken for PVA as they crossed the river.

Only D Company—which had been holding the summit and had withdrawn last—was heavily engaged and was unable to move at the scheduled time. The PVA launched a determined assault, preceding it with heavy machine-gun and mortar fire, before attempting to overrun the forward pits. D Company repelled the PVA assault and Gravener decided to begin to thin out his position before the situation deteriorated further. With one platoon covering their movement, D Company subsequently withdrew, closely pursued by the PVA. Finally, D Company succeeded in achieving a clean break after dark, and D Company was able to safely withdraw. By 23:30, the battalion was clear, completing its withdrawal at full speed, and suffering only minimal casualties. Regardless, the previous 24 hours of fighting had been costly for the 3 RAR, resulting in 32 killed, 59 wounded and three captured; the bulk of them in A Company and battalion headquarters. Yet, they had temporarily delayed the assault on the brigade&#x27;s right flank, and had inflicted far heavier casualties on the PVA before being withdrawn. Significantly for the 3 RAR and 16 NZFR, 25 April was Anzac Day. Following their successful conquest of Hill 504, the PVA turned their attention to the encircled 2 PPCLI on the left flank.

==Canadian 2 PPCLI last stand on Hill 677, 24–25 April 1951==

===Preparations===
On 23 April, Stone, battalion commander of the 2 PPCLI, had personally reconnoitred the Kapyong battlefield and the approaches to Hill 677, discerning which routes of assault the PVA could possibly choose. Stone then directed his Pioneer Platoon to widen and reconstruct a narrow, winding trail which ascended Hill 677 on the south slopes from the village of Tungmudae. This provided Stone with an essential supply route and the ability to maneouvre 12 M3 Half-tracks carrying heavy machine guns and mortars up to the summit of Hill 677, which he then positioned adjacent to his battalion headquarters. These engineering assignments were completed just before major PVA forces arrived on the battlefield.

Now assembled on the summit of Hill 677, the 700 soldiers of 2 PPCLI spent the night of 23/24 April in their shallow pits listening to the sounds of the fighting on the 3 RAR front. However, by early morning PVA activity to encircle Hill 677 increased and, with the situation deteriorating on Hill 504 on their right flank, Stone withdrew B Company from their position on the north edge of the Hill 677 summit to strengthen this eastern flank if the 3 RAR were forced to withdraw. Under the command of Major Vince Lilley, B company subsequently moved to occupy positions east of battalion headquarters on the high ground overlooking the valley road. Stone&#x27;s intuitions were proven to be sound when this position, which protected not only his 2 PPCLI battalion headquarters but the battalion&#x27;s major concentrations of heavy machine guns and mortars, would prove crucial during the fierce climax of the upcoming night battle.

With increasing fears that the 3 RAR would be overcome and leave his right flank exposed to attack, Stone had redeployed B Company to cover the area overlooking the valley of the Kapyong. B Company, 2 PPCLI completed its redeployment by 11:00, just in time. However, a company of American tanks from US 72nd Tank Battalion supporting 3 RAR noticed the B Company adjustment and mistook the movement for enemy troops. The US tanks opened fire on the 2 PPCLI, wounding one man, and then continued their retreat from the battlefield. The 2 PPCLI battalion now occupied a northward-facing arc curving from the summit of Hill 677 in the west to the high ground on the east closest to the river. D Company defended the left flank of the battalion, removed at a substantial distance from the main positions of 2 PPCLI which were over on the battalion&#x27;s centre and right, C Company the central forward slope, while A and B Company held the right flank. The high grass and severe terrain of Hill 677 limited the ability of each company to provide mutual support. At the same time, the numerous ravines on the edge of the high hill afforded the attacking forces hidden avenues of approach to the summit of Hill 677 to within a short distance of the 2 PPCLI positions.

During the retreat of 3 RAR from Hill 504, Stone ordered 2 PPCLI B Company to provide covering fire to assist the 3 RAR escape on the run, clearly visible from Hill 677. With the PVA chasing the 3 RAR in fast pursuit, B Company opened continuous heavy machine gun fire for about a ten minute period, exacting heavy PVA losses and enabling the 3 RAR to make good their escape. O&#x27;Dowd, the 3 RAR field commander, requested an end to the supporting fire, fearful of the possibility of unintended 3 RAR casualties.

Stone would later complain of the sudden disappearance of the US artillery support, &quot;when the battle got hot on the Australian front, the Forward Observation Officer for the US mortars on my front walked out and never a pop did we get from his company.&quot; The two US artillery companies had fled on foot, leaving their mortars, guns, supplies, and 50 loaded trucks plus other vehicles behind on the battlefield. The two US mortar companies then hiked and traversed to the east before resting, apparently convinced that a major PVA breakthrough was imminent at Kapyong. Stone later bitterly observed that among some of the UN forces, &quot;bug-outs were the accepted manner of withdrawing.&quot; With the departure of the US tanks and artillery support and the forced retreat of the 3 RAR battalion, Stone&#x27;s command was now surrounded and cut off from their possible supply routes and would be reliant upon existing supplies and ammunition. Each of the four 2 PPCLI companies was allocated two Vickers medium machine guns, as well as three mortars. Defensive fire tasks were registered, while additional ammunition was pushed out to the forward companies in the afternoon.

As darkness descended on 24 April, Burke decided not to utilize radio contacts with 2 PPCLI headquarters on the summit of Hill 677. Burke ordered a Dakota aircraft equipped with loudspeakers and personally flew over the 2 PPCLI positions on Hill 677. He announced to the soldiers below that they were now on their own, cut off from any support and would have to fight the coming battle alone. He wished them good luck and encouraged them to fight bravely. He then flew back to Brigade HQ, amidst derisive response from the unsettled soldiers. Burke&#x27;s brief appearance over the battlefield served to cause further apprehension among the 2 PPCLI. Many of the less experienced 2 PPCLI soldiers voiced a desire to run and abandon the position. Veteran war hero Tommy Prince played a central role in steadying and motivating the frightened men. Stone and 2 PPCLI could no longer expect that 27th Brigade HQ forces would continue to engage the enemy or would assemble a relief column to break through the PVA stranglehold on the supply road at Tungmudae. Stone was never in any doubt as to the essential strategic significance of Hill 677 for the UN forces and he issued a straightforward order to his battalion on the battalion radio sets, &quot;We&#x27;re surrounded. We&#x27;ll hold this position until we&#x27;re relieved.&quot; &quot;No retreat, no surrender.&quot;

===Night battle===
To prepare and plan their initial assaults on Hill 677, the PVA command were not able to pinpoint the 2 PPCLI defensive positions, having had no opportunity to carry out a thorough reconnaissance prior to the attack. However, the severe terrain and numerous ravines on the sides of Hill 677 provided the PVA with hidden access routes to the summit near the 2 PPCLI positions where the PVA formations would gather. The PVA formations were visible during the final mass assaults against the 2 PPCLI entrenchments. However, in the darkness, the 2 PPCLI rifle fire would prove to be ineffective, forcing them to resort to using large amounts of grenades followed by bayonets in hand-to-hand combat. The front lines of PVA attackers were all equipped with light machine guns, which, in close quarters fighting, were markedly superior to the 2 PPCLI Lee-Enfield Mark III single-shot manual bolt-action rifles. Canadian Army command policy was lenient to allowing personal arms and a few 2 PPCLI soldiers possessed privately-acquired Bren guns of their own to provide close quarters machine gun capability, and this factor would be crucial in the outcome of the Company B defence of battalion HQ and main artillery positions.

The PVA mortars and artillery were largely ineffective in the first assaults, and very few rounds fell on the 2 PPCLI positions during the initial assaults of the evening. However, in the later climactic mass attacks against Company D, the PVA artillery and mortars were important in leading the assaults, then being directed with accurate observer information from the summit. In their haste to follow up the collapse of the ROK 6th Division, the PVA 118th and 60th Divisions had left the bulk of their slow-moving heavy artillery and supplies well to the north.

Having dislodged the defenders from Hill 504, the PVA 60th Division and 118th Division would attempt to capture the dominating heights of Hill 677 held by the 2 PPCLI. The PVA had earlier detected the redeployment of B Company, 2 PPCLI and at 22:00 that evening, they commenced an assault on the defenders&#x27; right flank, the first of four attacks directed at 6 Platoon of B Company. Although the initial moves were beaten back by medium machine gun fire and mortars, a second PVA assault an hour later succeeded in overrunning the right forward section of 6 Platoon. The platoon successfully withdrew in small groups back to the company main defensive position, where they eventually halted the PVA advance. In this first wave of mass assaults of the PVA, the 2 PPCLI mortars had proven vital, their stability allowing for rapid fire out to with an ability to accurately hit narrow ridgelines at maximum range. The PVA had telegraphed their intentions prior to the assault by using tracer fire for direction, and had used bugles to co-ordinate troops in their forming up positions. Such inflexibility had allowed the 2 PPCLI to co-ordinate indirect fires and took a heavy toll on the attackers in the forming up positions.

During the successive attacks on 6 Platoon of B Company, Private W. R. Mitchell became prominent. Mitchell possessed his own Bren gun with which he launched single-handed counter-attacks against PVA formations, firing on the run and dispersing the enemy, thereby rescuing 6 Platoon sections which had been cut off. Despite being twice wounded by PVA shrapnel and a bullet, he persisted with his personal Bren gun forays, and later refused to leave combat for medical treatment, remaining in his position throughout the night. By the morning, he could barely stand for loss of blood. Mitchell was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. The next morning, 51 PVA dead were counted around the B Company perimeter.

At about 24:00, 6 Platoon headquarters and the remaining sections ran out of ammunition and were ordered to fix bayonets and defend their positions. One of the 6 Platoon sergeants during the thick of the action “hurled his bayoneted rifle like a spear when his ammunition gave out.”
Meanwhile, Lt. Hub Gray of B Company detected a full battalion sized PVA force of about 500 men climbing silently through the ravine access south of the B Company position. This force assembled quietly without the usual PVA bugle and sound signals, and then moved en masse toward Stone&#x27;s battalion headquarters, apparently according to a preconceived plan of attack. Lilley of B Company warned Stone of the impending assault, and Stone himself assumed command of the HQ combat forces for this engagement. Twelve M3 Half-tracks from Mortar Platoon had already been positioned there by Stone before the battle, each armed with a .50-calibre and a .30-calibre Browning machine gun. Stone held fire until the PVA broke through the tree-line and advanced to just from their front. The assembled defenders opened fire with machine guns and with mortars at their minimum engagement distance. The PVA suffered severe casualties and the assault was beaten off. During the height of this battle for the 2 PPCLI HQ, the rear platoon of A Company to the north of B Company opened fire with their Vickers medium machine guns in support of Stone&#x27;s position. Stone contacted the A Company second-in-command and rejoined, &quot;Stop your firing...we can take care of ourselves. Save your ammunition, you&#x27;re going to need it.&quot; The PVA&#x27;s next plan of attack would focus on areas where the 2 PPCLI heavy machine guns were not a factor in defence.

Shortly after the second major assault on B Company was repelled, another large PVA assault force was detected fording the Kapyong Valley river in the bright moonlight, some 2000 feet beneath the Kapyong summit height and about 800 metres distant. The 2 PPCLI .50 calibre heavy machine guns were concentrated on this body of soldiers, and 71 bodies were counted on the banks of the river the following day.

The PVA now turned their attention to D Company, holding a portion of the summit of Hill 677, separated from the bulk of 2 PPCLI by a long distance of about one mile on the battalion&#x27;s left flank and beyond the range of the concentrated group of 2 PPCLI medium and heavy machine gun defensive fire. PVA success on this flank was intended to provide a spacious staging area to assemble an overwhelmingly large force for a final assault against the 2 PPCLI battalion HQ and principal machine gun/mortar positions. At 01:10, a large PVA force was detected forming up on a spur to the west towards Hill 865 and they were engaged by defensive fire. The huge PVA formation assaulted 10 Platoon of D Company, commanded by Lt. Michael George Levy, with supporting fire from PVA medium machine-guns and artillery now directed and employed to better effect than previously. The PVA attackers were soon effectively engaged by Vickers machine guns from 12 Platoon firing in mutual support. Switching their axis of assault to 12 Platoon, the PVA succeeded in overrunning one of the 12 Platoon sections and a medium machine gun, killing two of its crew who had remained at their post firing until they were overcome. However, the attackers made no attempt to use the Vickers gun for their own advantage or to disable or damage the weapon. With the supporting artillery of 16 NZFR&#x27;s guns now fully engaged, firing at the &#x27;very slow&#x27; rate to conserve ammunition, the weight of the PVA assaults soon prompted Stone to request it be increased to the &#x27;slow&#x27; rate of two rounds per gun per minute, so that 24 rounds fell every 30 seconds within a target area of .
Despite the determined resistance from D Company, the PVA attack succeeded in infiltrating the D Company perimeter through the gaps between platoons, and D Company was surrounded on three sides. The forward platoons of D company were completely overrun by PVA infantry. The company commander, Captain J.G.W. Mills, acting on a request from 10 Platoon leader Levy, in turn requested from Stone a supporting artillery barrage on three separate occasions targeted directly onto Levy&#x27;s position. Levy had commanded his men to seek whatever cover they could in the shallow trenches which had been scraped out of the rocky ground. Stone approved the request, after first asking Mills, &quot;Do you know what you are asking?&quot;, and receiving an affirmative response. Stone then immediately contacted 16 NZFR HQ and arranged for barrages of shrapnel shells from 16 NZFR&#x27;s guns, now located some distant. The barrages onto Levy&#x27;s platoon occurred on the three occasions during the early morning of 25 April after 10 Platoon was overrun by PVA mass attacks, each barrage consisting of about 15 to 20 minutes duration. The shrapnel shells were fused to explode several metres or yards above ground. This tactic succeeded and the massed PVA soldiers were devastated by the shrapnel fire, while D Company in their dug-out holes escaped largely unharmed by the shrapnel shells, with a small number of casualties but no fatal wounds. The shrapnel shells fell within of the 2 PPCLI slit trenches, but there were no direct hits on any of the trenches. The number of PVA soldiers killed by the artillery barrages was estimated at approximately 4,000. 16 NZFR and their 25-pound guns fired an estimated 10,000 rounds in the course of the night battle in support of D Company. The PVA persisted, however, launching a number of smaller attacks against D company during the rest of the night, but these were again repulsed by artillery and small arms fire.

By dawn, the attacks on the 2 PPCLI positions had abated, and with D Company remaining in control of the left flank, they were able to recover the previously abandoned machine gun at first light in daring fashion. Private Kenneth Barwise, who had personally killed six enemy soldiers while carrying ammunition resupply during the mass assaults on D Company, now ran down through no-man&#x27;s-land to the abandoned Vickers medium machine gun. After exchanging fire with nearby PVA forces, he snatched the heavy load in his arms and raced back to his own lines while in full view of the enemy. Barwise was awarded the Military Medal for his deeds. Meanwhile, on the right flank, B Company was able to re-occupy the platoon position it had been forced to relinquish earlier the previous evening. The PVA had suffered enormous casualties during the night assaults, with perhaps 300 or even more than 1,000 killed by the 2 PPCLI, and there were also a great many more killed by the heavy artillery barrages from 16 NZFR. The PVA, following their usual procedure, had removed most of their battlefield dead during the night, and 2 PPCLI soldiers did not venture out to count the dead until after the battle. Gray found the bodies of a 2 PPCLI corporal and his PVA opponent lying together after a bayonet combat, mute testimony to the intensity of the fighting. However, with the 2 PPCLI now completely exhausted of its ammunition and medical and food supplies, another full-scale PVA assault during that night would have been difficult for the 2 PPCLI to resist. Fortunately for the 2 PPCLI, such an assault did not materialize.
===Final 2 PPCLI Operations===
Although the PVA continued to mount small attacks, 2 PPCLI were now in control of the summit. Following the retreat of the 3 RAR battalion on the previous day, the PVA had established blocking positions on the supply road from the rear slope of Hill 677 to the village of Tungmudae. This was the trail which had been improved by Stone on 23 April just prior to the PVA assaults. PVA control of the rear slopes of Hill 677 had cut the 2 PPCLI off from resupply and prevented any form of military reinforcements or relief from reaching them. Anticipating that the battle would continue into the evening of the 25th or be renewed with intensity by another major assault by the PVA 118th and 60th Division forces, Stone made a request at 04:00 that food, ammunition, and water be airdropped directly onto Hill 677 and by 10:00 the required supplies—including mortar ammunition—were dropped by four American C-119 Flying Boxcars flying from an airbase in Japan. During the air drop, only four parachutes landed in PVA controlled areas with the remainder successfully recovered by 2 PPCLI.

The 2 PPCLI continued to improve their defensive position and trenches. The Middlesex from the reserve positions deployed in front of 27th Brigade HQ sent out patrols during the morning in order to reconnoitre the PVA forces that had occupied the rear areas behind Hill 677 and surrounded the 2 PPCLI positions during the previous day. It was not until 14:00 on 25 April that patrols from B Company, 2 PPCLI reported that the supply trail was now clear, and that the PVA 118th and 60th Divisions had apparently withdrawn to the north. Stone subsequently requested that further supplies be sent forward by vehicle as rapidly as feasible while the supply route through Tungmudae remained open, and before the PVA divisions could return. Having left their supplies of food and ammunition far behind during the advance two days earlier, the PVA 118th and 60th Divisions had withdrawn back up the Kapyong Valley in the late afternoon of 25 April in order to regroup and replenish following the extremely heavy casualties incurred during the fighting. The principal PVA formations had thus retreated prior to any UN relief forces reaching the 2 PPCLI positions, fulfilling the grim assessment given by Burke to the encircled 2 PPCLI when he flew over them on the evening of 24 April.

The remainder of 25 April was relatively quiet for 2 PPCLI, although they were subjected to periodic harassing fire from the PVA. D Company received heavy machine-gun fire from Hill 865 to the west, in particular. Regardless, the PVA made no further attempts to attack, and confined themselves to limited patrolling activities across the front.

Burke had already been removed from command on the morning of 25 April and replaced by Brigadier George Taylor, a senior officer who had served with great distinction in WWII. Taylor then ordered the US 5th Cavalry Regiment to launch an assault to recover Hill 504 on the afternoon of 25 April which resulted in substantial US casualties. The remaining PVA soldiers on that hill position offered some resistance until about 16:00.

The following day on 26 April the 2 PPCLI, now replenished with ammunition and other supplies, launched an assault against the remaining PVA entrenched on the northern slopes of Hill 677. Several PVA concentrations were broken up by heavy artillery fire and airstrikes. The 2 PPCLI were finally relieved on Hill 677 by a battalion of the 5th Cavalry Regiment on the evening of 26 April. US patrols north of the feature met no resistance, while the US forces were also able to patrol east along Route 17 to Chunchon without contacting the PVA. By last light on 27 April, the situation had been stabilised on the Kapyong Valley front. The 2 PPCLI now formed the rear guard of the 27th Brigade as they moved out of the Kapyong sector towards the Seoul region of the UN front on 28 April. This rear guard was given the sobriquet of &quot;the Stone force&quot;, after their commander.

Stone himself offered an assessment of the lesson emerging from the Battle of Kapyong, &quot;Kapyong demonstrated that morale, spirit of the troops, is probably the most important factor in battle.&quot; At the 2 PPCLI last stand at Hill 677, in addition to the five high level medals awarded, there were eleven Mentioned in Dispatches, indicating a widespread combat response from the 2 PPCLI. Most importantly, Stone had devised, and had insisted upon over the objections of his superior generals, a rigorous six-week training course in mountain combat at the Miryang mountains in southern South Korea immediately prior to assignment with 27th Brigade in February, which prepared his men for the confused and isolated night combats at Kapyong. Stone&#x27;s final assessment of his battalion&#x27;s performance at Kapyong was that &quot;with [UN] units buckling all around them, the Patricia&#x27;s did not give up an inch of ground.&quot; Stone claimed, &quot;The front broke everywhere and we were the only battalion holding in the whole of Korea on our side at the time.&quot;

==Aftermath==
===Summary and casualties===
With vastly superior numbers, the PVA had attacked on a broad front, and had overrun a number of the UN positions. After a fierce fire-fight the PVA had pushed the ROK 6th Division, 3 RAR and US tank and artillery forces at Kapyong. In addition, five companies (two US mortar companies, two companies of the US 74th Engineer Combat Battalion and a company of the Middlesex) had fled the battlefield by foot east to Chunchon in anticipation of a PVA breakthrough. All of these UN units withdrew from combat into a reserve position, and did not engage the PVA further in the battle. The 2 PPCLI, supported by long distance artillery fire from 16 NZFR managed to survive a two-day encirclement and resisted full assaults by the PVA 118th and 60th Divisions, causing the PVA to withdraw before the arrival of UN relief forces. The UN forces ultimately prevailed, albeit through a last stand by the 2 PPCLI, despite being outnumbered on the field of battle by a factor of greater than ten to one.

Indeed, despite their numerical advantage and possession of light machine guns, which gave the PVA the advantage in small arms fire, the PVA had been outgunned in heavy artillery capacity. This edge in artillery fire allowed the 2 PPCLI to survive and succeed at Kapyong. And yet, despite their eventual defeat, the battle once again demonstrated that the PVA were tough and skillful soldiers capable of inflicting heavy casualties on the 3 RAR and US tanks and forcing their retreat off the battlefield.

As a result of the fighting, 3 RAR losses were 32 killed (two by friendly fire from the US air strike), 59 wounded and three captured, while 2 PPCLI casualties on 24/25 April included 10 killed and 23 wounded, later amended to 12 killed and 35 wounded (one by friendly fire from US tanks, several by friendly fire from 16 NZFR). US casualties included three men killed, 12 wounded, and two tanks destroyed, all from A Company, 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion. 16 NZFR lost two killed and five wounded. The US 5th Cavalry Regiment suffered 10 killed and more wounded on 25 and 26 April at Hill 504 and other locations at Kapyong. Total UN casualties in the Battle of Kapyong were 59 killed and more than 111 wounded.

In contrast, the PVA losses were far heavier, and may have included 1,000–5,000 killed and many more wounded.

In the battle at Hill 677, there were no reports of any 2 PPCLI soldier surrendering or being taken captive, nor of any PVA soldiers surrendering or being taken captive.

===Awards===
2 PPCLI, 3 RAR and A Company, US 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion were all subsequently awarded the US Presidential Unit Citation in June 1951 for their actions during the battle. 16 NZFR, without whom the 3 RAR and 2 PPCLI might have suffered a fate of annihilation, were awarded the South Korean Presidential Unit Citation in November 1951. Although the 2 PPCLI and 3 RAR had borne the brunt of the fighting, the Middlesex had also been briefly engaged in action early in the battle, but were not awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.

Burke, who commanded the 27th Brigade at Kapyong, was not given any award for the battle, having withdrawn his Brigade forces into a reserve position during the battle. Burke was removed from command on the morning of 25 April while the battle was still in progress and was immediately transported to Hong Kong. He was later assigned to Malaya.

Stone was not nominated by Burke for an award for the battle. However eight months later, in December 1951, Stone was nominated by Brigadier Rockingham for his third Distinguished Service Order for Stone&#x27;s period of command of 2 PPCLI throughout the year of 1951, and the award was made in February 1952. Stone had remained in the front line of combat leading his men, which was a necessary requirement for the DSO award. Stone&#x27;s insistence on creating a special mountain combat training course in Korea for the 2 PPCLI just prior to assignment with 27th Brigade in February, obtained by Stone over the objections of the U.S. generals commanding U.S. Eighth Army, was vindicated, and Stone&#x27;s previous experiences with mountain battles in Italy were employed to construct the 2 PPCLI defensive arrangements at Kapyong. In December 2016, Stone was posthumously (Stone died in 2005) designated as an official Korean War Hero by the Government of South Korea Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs. The citation stated that the 2 PPCLI battalion had &quot;achieved a milestone victory when they won the Battle of Gapyeong (Kapyong) against formidable attacks from Chinese troops&quot; and that &quot;with their victory in the Battle of Gapyeong (Kapyong), Stone and his soldiers are remembered as the Legends of Gapyeong to this day.&quot;

Mills, commander of D Company of 2 PPCLI, was nominated by Stone and awarded the Military Cross for endorsing and forwarding 10 Platoon commander Levy&#x27;s requests for artillery fire to be directed upon Levy&#x27;s own position, an act which may have been responsible for the 2 PPCLI survival and success at Kapyong. However, unknown to Stone, Mills was not present in the actual battle area, but was behind a protective ridge. He was reliant upon the judgment and directions from Levy, who was active in the trenches directing the D Company platoons and calling in the artillery strikes locations through Mills.

Levy himself was not awarded a medal, which later became a point of controversy. However, in 2004 the Governor General of Canada awarded Levy an official grant of arms, flag and badge, with a personal coat of arms in recognition of his central role in the battle. In 2017, Levy was posthumously (Levy died in 2007) awarded the Ambassador of Peace Medal by the South Korean government. Following Kapyong, Stone appointed Levy to be his Chief Intelligence Officer for the battalion.

Ferguson was nominated by Burke and awarded the DSO. Burke claimed that Ferguson had displayed bravery under fire. Ferguson did not nominate O&#x27;Dowd for an award. O&#x27;Dowd had assumed field command of the battalion and had designed and executed the 3 RAR escape. Ferguson was removed from command in July and was assigned to training duties in Australia.

Koch was awarded both the American Distinguished Service Cross and the British Military Cross for the essential role his tanks had played in the fighting around Hill 504.

The Royal Australian Regiment, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry and the Middlesex Regiment were subsequently granted the battle honour &quot;Kapyong&quot;. Today, the battle is regarded as the most famous action fought by the Canadian and Australian armies in Korea, and the most famous action fought by the Canadian Armed Forces since WWII. On the battlefield itself, a major park and memorial to the Canadian Army was built and dedicated in 1983, the (Kapyong) Gapyeong Canada Monument. There is also a major park and monument dedicated to the Australian Army participation in the battle, 1.3 kilometres distant from the Canadian monument in the same area.

===Subsequent operations===
By 29 April, the PVA Spring Offensive was halted by UN forces at a defensive line north of Seoul, known as the &quot;No-Name Line.&quot; In total, it was a withdrawal of in the US I and IX Corps sectors, and in the US X Corps and ROK III Corps sectors. Although the main blow had fallen on US I Corps, the resistance by British Commonwealth forces in the battles at the Imjin River and at Kapyong had helped to blunt its impetus and prevented a potential encirclement of the U.S. forces in Korea, which were then in full retreat across the Korean front lines. The defence mounted by the 27th Brigade stopped the PVA from isolating US I Corps from US IX Corps, and prevented a potential surrounding of the UN forces. This also halted the PVA advance on Seoul and prevented its capture. The PVA had now nearly exhausted their resources of men and material, and were approaching the limit of their supply lines. Some PVA soldiers were now tired, hungry, and short of equipment and during the fighting at Hill 504 they had demonstrated a greater willingness to surrender than in previous encounters, with 3 RAR taking 39 prisoners, only eight of them wounded. There were no reports of PVA soldiers surrendering or being taken captive in the battle at Hill 677. Contingent on the rapid attainment of its objectives, the attempted PVA coup de main ultimately failed amid heavy casualties and they abandoned their attacks against US I and IX Corps. The PVA had suffered at least 30,000 casualties during the period 22–29 April. In contrast, US casualties during the same period numbered just 314 killed and 1,600 wounded, while Commonwealth, ROK and other UN contingents brought the total to 547 killed, 2,024 wounded and 2,170 captured, the disparity highlighting the devastating effect of UN artillery firepower against massed infantry. Undeterred by these setbacks, the Second Phase of the Spring Offensive began on 16 May to the east of Kapyong, which ended at the Battle of the Soyang River.

27th Brigade was reformed and renamed as the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade. Burke was removed from command during the battle, with Brigadier George Taylor taking over command of the new formation on 25 April. The new Commonwealth formation was pulled back into IX Corps reserve to the southwest of Kapyong, near the junction of the Pukhan and Chojon rivers, with the 2 PPCLI forming the rearguard of the manoeuvre. 3 RAR was transferred to 28th Brigade, while the 1st Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers and the 1st Battalion, The King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry replaced the Argylls and Middlesex regiments. Later, 2 PPCLI was transferred to the newly arrived 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade on 27 May. After protracted negotiations between the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa, an agreement had been reached to establish an integrated formation with the aim of increasing the political significance of their contribution, as well as facilitating the solution of the logistic and operational problems faced by the various Commonwealth contingents. The 1st Commonwealth Division was formed on 28 July 1951, with the division including the 25th Canadian, 28th British Commonwealth, and 29th British Infantry Brigades under the command of Major General James Cassels, and was attached to US I Corps. 

For many of the 3 RAR, Kapyong was to be their last major battle before completing their period of duty and being replaced, having endured much hard fighting, appalling weather, and the chaos and confusion of a campaign that had ranged up and down the length of the Korean Peninsula. Most had served in the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) during WWII and this combat experience had proven vital. Regardless, casualties had been heavy, and since the battalion&#x27;s arrival from Japan in September 1950, the 3 RAR had lost 87 killed, 291 wounded and five captured.

Both 3 RAR and 2 PPCLI would participate in Operation Commando in October 1951 which would define the final battle lines in that sector for the remainder of the Korean War. On 12 October 1951, Stone and 2 PPCLI would repel a large attacking force of the PVA. In December of 1951, the annual enlistments for 2 PPCLI expired and most of the soldiers were discharged from the Canadian Army. In early 1952, Stone would recruit new men to form and train 2 PPCLI as an elite special operations unit and parachute battalion.

<doc id="570140" wikidata="Q665617" url="?curid=570140" title="Infinite impulse response">
<text>Infinite impulse response (IIR) is a property applying to many linear time-invariant systems that are distinguished by having an impulse response formula_1 that does not become exactly zero past a certain point but continues indefinitely. This is in contrast to a finite impulse response (FIR) system, in which the impulse response &quot;does&quot; become exactly zero at times formula_2 for some finite formula_3, thus being of finite duration. Common examples of linear time-invariant systems are most electronic and digital filters. Systems with this property are known as &quot;IIR systems&quot; or &quot;IIR filters&quot;.

In practice, the impulse response, even of IIR systems, usually approaches zero and can be neglected past a certain point. However the physical systems which give rise to IIR or FIR responses are dissimilar, and therein lies the importance of the distinction. For instance, analog electronic filters composed of resistors, capacitors, and/or inductors (and perhaps linear amplifiers) are generally IIR filters. On the other hand, discrete-time filters (usually digital filters) based on a tapped delay line &quot;employing no feedback&quot; are necessarily FIR filters. The capacitors (or inductors) in the analog filter have a &quot;memory&quot; and their internal state never completely relaxes following an impulse (assuming the classical model of capacitors and inductors where quantum effects are ignored). But in the latter case, after an impulse has reached the end of the tapped delay line, the system has no further memory of that impulse and has returned to its initial state; its impulse response beyond that point is exactly zero.

==Implementation and design==
Although almost all analog electronic filters are IIR, digital filters may be either IIR or FIR. The presence of feedback in the topology of a discrete-time filter (such as the block diagram shown below) generally creates an IIR response. The z domain transfer function of an IIR filter contains a non-trivial denominator, describing those feedback terms. The transfer function of an FIR filter, on the other hand, has only a numerator as expressed in the general form derived below. All of the formula_4 coefficients with formula_5 (feedback terms) are zero and the filter has no finite poles.

The transfer functions pertaining to IIR analog electronic filters have been extensively studied and optimized for their amplitude and phase characteristics. These continuous-time filter functions are described in the Laplace domain. Desired solutions can be transferred to the case of discrete-time filters whose transfer functions are expressed in the z domain, through the use of certain mathematical techniques such as the bilinear transform, impulse invariance, or pole–zero matching method. Thus digital IIR filters can be based on well-known solutions for analog filters such as the Chebyshev filter, Butterworth filter, and elliptic filter, inheriting the characteristics of those solutions.

== Transfer function derivation ==
Digital filters are often described and implemented in terms of the difference equation that defines how the output signal is related to the input signal:

:formula_6

where:
*formula_7 is the feedforward filter order
*formula_8 are the feedforward filter coefficients
*formula_9 is the feedback filter order
*formula_10 are the feedback filter coefficients
*formula_11 is the input signal
*formula_12 is the output signal.

A more condensed form of the difference equation is:
:formula_13

To find the transfer function of the filter, we first take the Z-transform of each side of the above equation to obtain:
:formula_14

After rearranging:
:formula_15

We then define the transfer function to be:
:formula_16

== Stability ==
The transfer function allows one to judge whether or not a system is bounded-input, bounded-output (BIBO) stable. To be specific, the BIBO stability criterion requires that the ROC of the system includes the unit circle. For example, for a causal system, all poles of the transfer function have to have an absolute value smaller than one. In other words, all poles must be located within a unit circle in the formula_17-plane.

The poles are defined as the values of formula_17 which make the denominator of formula_19 equal to 0:

:formula_20

Clearly, if formula_21 then the poles are not located at the origin of the formula_17-plane. This is in contrast to the FIR filter where all poles are located at the origin, and is therefore always stable.

IIR filters are sometimes preferred over FIR filters because an IIR filter can achieve a much sharper transition region roll-off than an FIR filter of the same order.

== Example ==
Let the transfer function formula_19 of a discrete-time filter be given by:

:formula_24

governed by the parameter formula_25, a real number with formula_26. formula_19 is stable and causal with a pole at formula_25. The time-domain impulse response can be shown to be given by:

:formula_29

where formula_30 is the unit step function. It can be seen that formula_31 is non-zero for all formula_32, thus an impulse response which continues infinitely.

== Advantages and disadvantages==
The main advantage digital IIR filters have over FIR filters is their efficiency in implementation, in order to meet a specification in terms of passband, stopband, ripple, and/or roll-off. Such a set of specifications can be accomplished with a lower order (&quot;Q&quot; in the above formulae) IIR filter than would be required for an FIR filter meeting the same requirements. If implemented in a signal processor, this implies a correspondingly fewer number of calculations per time step; the computational savings is often of a rather large factor.

On the other hand, FIR filters can be easier to design, for instance, to match a particular frequency response requirement. This is particularly true when the requirement is not one of the usual cases (high-pass, low-pass, notch, etc.) which have been studied and optimized for analog filters. Also FIR filters can be easily made to be linear phase (constant group delay vs frequency)—a property that is not easily met using IIR filters and then only as an approximation (for instance with the Bessel filter). Another issue regarding digital IIR filters is the potential for limit cycle behavior when idle, due to the feedback system in conjunction with quantization.

== Design Methods ==
=== Impulse Invariance ===
Impulse invariance is a technique for designing discrete-time infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters from continuous-time filters in which the impulse response of the continuous-time system is sampled to produce the impulse response of the discrete-time system. 
Impulse invariance is one of the commonly used methods to meet the two basic requirements of the mapping from the s-plane to the z-plane. This is obtained by solving the T(z) that has the same output value at the same sampling time as the analog filter, and it is only applicable when the inputs are in a pulse.
Note that all inputs of the digital filter generated by this method are approximate values, except for pulse inputs that are very accurate. This is the simplest IIR filter design method. It is the most accurate at low frequencies, so it is usually used in low-pass filters.

For Laplace transform or z-transform, the output after the transformation is just the input multiplied by the corresponding transformation function, T(s) or T(z). Y(s) and Y(z) are the converted output of input X(s) and input X(z), respectively.
:formula_33
:formula_34
When applying the Laplace transform or z-transform on the unit impulse, the result is 1. Hence, the output results after the conversion are 
:formula_35
:formula_36
Now the output of the analog filter is just the inverse Laplace transform in the time domain.
:formula_37
If we use nT instead of t, we can get the output y(nT) derived from the pulse at the sampling time. It can also be expressed as y(n)
:formula_38
This discrete time signal can be applied z-transform to get T(z)
:formula_39
:formula_40
:formula_41
The last equation mathematically describes that a digital IIR filter is to perform z-transform on the analog signal that has been sampled and converted to T(s) by Laplace, which is usually simplified to
:formula_42
Pay attention to the fact that there is a multiplier T appearing in the formula. This is because even if the Laplace transform and z-transform for the unit pulse are 1, the pulse itself is not necessarily the same. For analog signals, the pulse has an infinite value but the area is 1 at t=0, but it is 1 at the discrete-time pulse t=0, so the existence of a multiplier T is required.

=== Step Invariance ===
Step invariance is a better design method than impulse invariant. The digital filter has several segments of input with different constants when sampling, which is composed of discrete steps. The step invariant IIR filter is less accurate than the same input step signal to the ADC. However, it is a better approximation for any input than the impulse invariant.
Step invariant solves the problem of the same sample values when T(z) and T(s) are both step inputs. The input to the digital filter is u(n), and the input to the analog filter is u(t). Apply z-transform and Laplace transform on these two inputs to obtain the converted output signal.
Perform z-transform on step input formula_43
Converted output after z-transform formula_44
Perform Laplace transform on step input formula_45
Converted output after Laplace transform formula_46
The output of the analog filter is y(t), which is the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s). If sampled every T seconds, it is y(n), which is the inverse conversion of Y(z).These signals are used to solve for the digital filter and the analog filter and have the same output at the sampling time.
The following equation points out the solution of T(z), which is the approximate formula for the analog filter. 
:formula_47
:formula_48
:formula_49
:formula_50

=== Bilinear Transform === 
The bilinear transform is a special case of a conformal mapping, often used to convert a transfer function formula_51 of a linear, time-invariant (LTI) filter in the continuous-time domain (often called an analog filter) to a transfer function formula_52 of a linear, shift-invariant filter in the discrete-time domain.
The bilinear transform is a first-order approximation of the natural logarithm function that is an exact mapping of the &quot;z&quot;-plane to the &quot;s&quot;-plane. When the Laplace transform is performed on a discrete-time signal (with each element of the discrete-time sequence attached to a correspondingly delayed unit impulse), the result is precisely the Z transform of the discrete-time sequence with the substitution of

:formula_53

where formula_54 is the numerical integration step size of the trapezoidal rule used in the bilinear transform derivation; or, in other words, the sampling period. The above bilinear approximation can be solved for formula_55 or a similar approximation for formula_56 can be performed.

The inverse of this mapping (and its first-order bilinear approximation) is

:formula_57

This relationship is used in the Laplace transfer function of any analog filter or the digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filter T(z) of the analog filter.
The bilinear transform essentially uses this first order approximation and substitutes into the continuous-time transfer function, formula_58

:formula_59

That is

:formula_60
which is used to calculate the IIR digital filter, starting from the Laplace transfer function of the analog filter.

<text>The Treaty of Amritsar, executed by the British East India Company and Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu after the First Anglo-Sikh War, established the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir under the suzerainty of the British Indian Empire.

== Background ==

The Battle of Sobraon in the First Anglo-Sikh War proved to be a decisive victory for the British East India Company over the Sikh Empire, inducing the Sikhs to sue for peace. Raja Gulab Singh, acting as the Wazir of the Sikh Empire, negotiated the terms of peace, which included the cession of the territory between the Sutlej and Beas, payment of 1.5 crore rupees in indemnity, and a drastic reduction in the Sikh army.

After the agreement was reached, the British Governor-General marched to Lahore on 20 February 1846. Soon afterwards, Rani Jindan, the queen mother and regent of the Sikh Empire, replaced Gulab Singh with Lal Singh as the Wazir. Lal Singh informed the British that the Sikh Darbar had the resources to pay only 0.5 crore (50 lakhs) in cash, and offered territory in lieu of the remaining one crore indemnity, suggesting the territories then under Gulab Singh&#x27;s control. The British, on the other hand, asked for the entire hilly region between Beas and Indus, including the Kashmir Valley, in lieu of one crore.

The plan of Lal Singh and Rani Jindan may have been to relieve Gulab Singh of his territories and reduce his power. However, Gulab Singh had built strong relations with the British. The Governor-General offered to recognise him as an independent sovereign of the ceded territories if he paid the indemnity due from the Sikhs, to which Gulab Singh agreed. These arrangements were formalised in the Anglo-Sikh Treaty (the Treaty of Lahore), Article XII of which stipulated that the Sikh Empire would recognise the &quot;independent sovereignty&quot; of Gulab Singh in whatever territories the British might offer to him via a separate treaty.

In the sequel, the British decided to keep the territory between Beas and Ravi rivers to themselves, which included the Kullu Valley with forts such as Kangra and Noorpur. The remaining hilly territory between Ravi and Indus rivers was granted to Gulab Singh for a reduced payment of 0.75 crore (75 lakhs). These territories, with some later adjustments, became the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir under British suzerainty. Gulab Singh and his descendants were recognised as the &quot;Maharajas&quot; of the princely state, until the accession to the Union of India in 1947.

== Description ==
The Treaty of Amritsar was executed on 16 March 1846. It formalised the arrangements between the British East India Company and Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu in the sequel to the Treaty of Lahore. By Article 1 of the treaty, Gulab Singh acquired &quot;all the hilly or mountainous country with its dependencies situated to the eastward of the River Indus and the westward of the River Ravi including Chamba and excluding Lahul, being part of the territories ceded to the British Government by the Lahore State according to the provisions of Article IV of the Treaty of Lahore, dated 9th March, 1846.&quot; Under Article 3, Gulab Singh was to pay 75 lakhs (7.5 million) of Nanak Shahi rupees (the ruling currency of the Sikh Empire) to the British Government, along with other annual tributes. The Treaty of Amritsar marked the beginning of Dogra rule in Kashmir.

<text>Leonardo S.p.A., formerly Leonardo-Finmeccanica and originally Finmeccanica, is an Italian multinational company specialising in aerospace, defence and security. Headquartered in Rome, Italy, the company has 180 sites worldwide. It is the 12th largest defence contractor in the world based on 2020 revenues. The company is partially owned by the Italian government, which holds 30.2% of the company&#x27;s shares and is its largest shareholder.

On 1 January 2016, Leonardo-Finmeccanica became a single industrial company by integrating the activities of its subsidiaries AgustaWestland, Alenia Aermacchi, DRS Technologies, Selex ES, OTO Melara and WASS. The company is organised into five divisions (Helicopters, Aircraft, Aerostructures, Electronics, Cybersecurity). It is also the parent company and corporate centre for the subsidiaries and joint ventures Telespazio, Thales Alenia Space, MBDA and ATR. Leonardo is listed on the Borsa Italiana and is a constituent of the FTSE MIB and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. 

, the company was known by the transitional name of Leonardo-Finmeccanica, as part of the restructuring process of the company carried out by CEO Mauro Moretti from the beginning of his mandate in 2014. The company changed its name to Leonardo S.p.A. on 1 January 2017, after the Italian inventor Leonardo da Vinci.

==History==

===Foundation===
Società Finanziaria Meccanica, &quot;Finmeccanica&quot;, was established in 1948 as the mechanical engineering subholding of the state-owned Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI). Finmeccanica has held for years some historic Italian enterprises, as Alfa Romeo (automobiles), Aeritalia (aerospace) and Ansaldo (engineering). 

From the 1960s to the 1980s Italy&#x27;s defence and aerospace industry was split into state-holding entities: owned the helicopters manufacturer Agusta, the defence company Oto Melara and the electronic enterprise Officine Galileo. STET (another IRI subsidiary) held Selenia, Elsag and SGS Thomson, all electronic enterprises with specializations in security and defense. In 1989, an internal IRI reorganization process brought STET electronic enterprises to Finmeccanica, and the Aeritalia-Selenia merger constituted its aerospace subsidiary Alenia.

===1990s===
In 1992 EFIM was wound up because of its troubled financial situation; and Agusta, Oto Melara, Officine Galileo and Breda passed to Finmeccanica, which became one of the main Italian industrial groups. Finmeccanica, which was previously fully state owned by IRI, became partly privatized in 1993, when it was listed in the Milan Borsa Italiana stock exchange.

In 1992 Finmeccanica&#x27;s Agusta became a 32% partner in NHIndustries, the prime contractor for the NH90 helicopter, along with Eurocopter (62.5%) and Fokker (5.5%).

===2000s===

In July 2000 Finmeccanica and the British GKN agreed to merge their respective helicopter subsidiaries (Agusta and GKN-Westland Helicopters) to form AgustaWestland. In December 2001, the missile business of Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS), a joint Finmeccanica/BAE Systems company, was merged with other European missile manufacturers to form MBDA, which became the world&#x27;s second largest missile manufacturer. In July 2003 Finmeccanica and BAE Systems announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies, to be collectively known as Eurosystems. These companies would have pooled the avionics, C4ISTAR and communications businesses of the two companies. 

In March 2007, BAE Systems sold its 25% share to Finmeccanica for €400 million. In January 2013 the company merged with Finmeccanica&#x27;s other defence electronics companies, SELEX Elsag and SELEX Sistemi Integrati, to become Selex ES. In May 2008 Finmeccanica announced its intention to purchase the U.S. defense contractor DRS Technologies for nearly $5.2 billion. In October 2008 the sale of DRS Technologies was finalized.

===2010s===

During 2011–2013, Finmeccanica emails were published by WikiLeaks and Finmeccanica was subject to judicial inquiries on several fronts and management changes.

According to Finmeccanica emails published in the Syria Files release by WikiLeaks on 5 July 2012, Finmeccanica increased its sale of mobile communications equipment to Syrian authorities during 2011, delivering 500 of these to the Damascus suburb Muadamia in May 2011, after the Syrian uprising had started, and sending engineers to Damascus in February 2012 to provide training in using the communications equipment in helicopter terminals, while the uprising continued. Finmeccanica stated that the equipment sales were legal, they occurred &quot;before the outbreak of conflict inside Syria&quot;, and the equipment &quot;was designed for use by emergency responders&quot; for civilian use only.

On 12 February 2013, the chief executive, Giuseppe Orsi, was arrested on corruption charges. Prosecutors alleged that he paid bribes to ensure the sale of 12 helicopters to the Indian government, when he was head of the group&#x27;s AgustaWestland unit.

In July 2013, the Letta government appointed former police chief Giovanni De Gennaro as Chairman of Finmeccanica. In December 2013 Finmeccanica sold 39.55% of its share capital in Ansaldo Energia to Fondo Strategico Italiano. 

In the first half of 2014, Finmeccanica&#x27;s new Chief Executive Officer and General Manager Mauro Moretti started a significant process of change for the Group, both in terms of strategic choices and organizational structure. The goal was to create a more cohesive and efficient group in which all processes (research, marketing and sales, engineering, procurement, strategies and governance) are centralized and integrated and can interact each other. This encompasses the 100% owned companies of the core aerospace and defence business (AgustaWestland, Alenia Aermacchi, Oto Melara, Selex ES and WASS) being transformed into seven new Finmeccanica divisions. The current holding company will then become an operating company based on seven major business areas, maintaining its parent company and corporate centre function for the Group companies excluded from the model (DRS Technologies, Telespazio, Thales Alenia Space, MBDA and ATR).

At the end of 2014, Finmeccanica transferred its stake in BredaMenarinibus to the newco Industria Italiana Autobus (20% Finmeccanica and 80% King Long), thereby taking a further step in the Group&#x27;s portfolio rationalization process.

In 2015, Hitachi signed a binding agreement with Finmeccanica for Hitachi&#x27;s acquisition of the AnsaldoBreda business, excluding some revamping activities and residual contracts, and of the entire Finmeccanica stake in the share capital of Ansaldo STS, approximately 40% of the total capital.

FATA, another subsidiary of the Finmeccanica Group since 2004 that was not part of the core business, was sold in 2015 to the Gruppo Danieli, dealing in the production of steel plants.

On 1 January 2016, Finmeccanica became a single integrated industrial entity, that absorbed the activities of AgustaWestland, Alenia Aermacchi, Selex ES, OTO Melara and WASS.

=== From Finmeccanica to Leonardo ===
A company rebranding operation led by Mauro Moretti began in March 2016, with a proposal to change the company name. From 1 January 2017 Finmeccanica officially became Leonardo, a name inspired by the Italian &quot;savant&quot; Leonardo da Vinci. In March 2017 the Italian Treasury proposed that the veteran banker Alessandro Profumo replace Mauro Moretti as CEO of Leonardo. In May 2017 the Board appointed Alessandro Profumo to the role.
=== 2020s ===
On 10 May 2023 the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Roberto Cingolani to the position of Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, Mr. Stefano Pontecorvo to the role of Chairman, Mr. Lorenzo Mariani to the role of Co-General Manager.

<doc id="570145" wikidata="Q3026198" url="?curid=570145" title="Diane DiMassa">
<text>Diane DiMassa (born 1959) is an American feminist artist, noted as creator of the alternative cartoon character Hothead Paisan, Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist, whose wild antics have been described as rage therapy for the marginalised. DiMassa is also active in oil painting and street art.

== Hothead Paisan ==
&quot;Hothead Paisan&quot; made its debut in 1991, and was initially published four times a year by Giant Ass Publishing (Stacy Sheehan and Diane DiMassa). The series was part of an underground &#x27;zine explosion which happened in the early 1990s, and instantly snared a loyal cult following. DiMassa published &quot;Hothead Paisan&quot; from 1991–1996; the whole series has been collected into the anthology &quot;The Complete Hothead Paisan&quot;, published by Cleis Press. It contains all 21 issues, plus 20 extra pages. (The original issues are still available on the Hothead Paisan website.)

&quot;Hothead Paisan&quot; is rage therapy for the marginalized and disaffected, the fed up, and anyone sickened by society&#x27;s ills. Her readers comprise a full spectrum of gender, orientation, race and class. Hothead literally started out as journal material to vent and deal with anger issues by DiMassa when first entering into drug and alcohol recovery. The first issue, published as a mini-comic, was twelve pages long and elicited a roaring response, giving rise to the ongoing series, and soon after, a line of merchandise called &quot;Groovy Crapola&quot; which included shirts, mugs, hats, rubber stamps, etc.

Hothead has no filter and reacts viscerally and violently to the injustices of the world. Her acting out of the fantasies that &quot;normal&quot; people have but would never act on holds her appeal; she does it for us unapologetically and uproariously. Her cat Chicken brings in a more spiritual, wise (and wise-cracking) element. Hothead&#x27;s best friend Roz is an older psychic blind woman who is a pacifist and almost endlessly patient with Hothead. These and other characters make &quot;Hothead Paisan&quot; a well-rounded experience which speaks to the many facets of the reader&#x27;s emotional landscape.

According to DiMassa, the themes reflected in &quot;Hothead Paisan&quot; are &quot;less about anything particularly lesbian, and more about a slant on how unbalanced society is&quot; and represents a &quot;matter of astuteness among [her] fans than really gayness .. although ninety percent of them are gay.&quot; This societal imbalance is explained in the Gabrielle Dean&#x27;s feminist analysis of the comic strip which postulates that Hothead is a &quot;phallicized dyke&quot; who is &quot;at the mercy of her own rage against society, which she expresses by castrating men who are exaggerated stand-ins for the patriarchal order.

In 2002, a candy bar named after Hothead Paisan — the &quot;Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist&quot; booster bar — sold out quickly in San Francisco, where DiMassa was living at the time.

== Other work ==
DiMassa illustrated the &quot;Pussycat Fever&quot; chapbook by the late Kathy Acker, along with Freddie Baer (AK Press, 1995); &quot;My Gender Workbook&quot; by Kate Bornstein (which won a 1999 Firecracker Alternative Book Award); and &quot;Sexing the Body&quot; by Anne-Fausto Sterling. DiMassa illustrated &quot;Jokes and the Unconscious&quot;, a graphic novel written by poet and writer Daphne Gottlieb, which was published by Cleis Press in 2006.

DiMassa has contributed to numerous comic/literary anthologies from the early 1990s to the present, the most recent being &quot;Live Through This&quot; (Seven Stories Press), which is a collection of prose and art by women describing the role that art has played in dealing with issues such as addiction.

== Current work ==
DiMassa currently does a bit of cartooning/illustrating, but focuses mainly on oil painting and street art pieces often based on Hothead Paisan and Chicken.

== Personal life ==
DiMassa grew up in West Haven, Connecticut.

<text>Egalitarian communities are groups of people who have chosen to live together, with egalitarianism as one of their core values. A broad definition of egalitarianism is &quot;equal access to resources and to decision-making power.&quot; For example, decision-making is done by consensus or another system in which each person has a voice; it is not done hierarchically with only one or a few people making choices that will affect the whole group. If the group shares assets (income, vehicles, etc.), they are distributed equitably throughout the group, and each member has access to more-or-less the same resources as any other member. Egalitarian communities are a type of commune (some communal groups are not egalitarian in nature).

An &quot;egalitarian decision&quot; is a decision made by a group as opposed to a single individual. The decision may be made by committee or elected members but still is an egalitarian decision.

The Federation of Egalitarian Communities is a network of communal groups in North America with values including egalitarianism, non-violence, income-sharing and cooperation.

<doc id="570153" wikidata="Q1762339" url="?curid=570153" title="Deep vein thrombosis">
<text>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a type of venous thrombosis involving the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs or pelvis. A minority of DVTs occur in the arms. Symptoms can include pain, swelling, redness, and enlarged veins in the affected area, but some DVTs have no symptoms. 

The most common life-threatening concern with DVT is the potential for a clot to embolize (detach from the veins), travel as an embolus through the right side of the heart, and become lodged in a pulmonary artery that supplies blood to the lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT and PE comprise the cardiovascular disease of venous thromboembolism (VTE). 

About two-thirds of VTE manifests as DVT only, with one-third manifesting as PE with or without DVT. The most frequent long-term DVT complication is post-thrombotic syndrome, which can cause pain, swelling, a sensation of heaviness, itching, and in severe cases, ulcers. Recurrent VTE occurs in about 30% of those in the ten years following an initial VTE.
The mechanism behind DVT formation typically involves some combination of decreased blood flow, increased tendency to clot, changes to the blood vessel wall, and inflammation. Risk factors include recent surgery, older age, active cancer, obesity, infection, inflammatory diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome, personal history and family history of VTE, trauma, injuries, lack of movement, hormonal birth control, pregnancy, and the period following birth. VTE has a strong genetic component, accounting for approximately 50 to 60% of the variability in VTE rates. Genetic factors include non-O blood type, deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S and the mutations of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A. In total, dozens of genetic risk factors have been identified.
People suspected of having DVT can be assessed using a prediction rule such as the Wells score. A D-dimer test can also be used to assist with excluding the diagnosis or to signal a need for further testing. Diagnosis is most commonly confirmed by ultrasound of the suspected veins. VTE becomes much more common with age. The condition is rare in children, but occurs in almost 1% of those ≥ age 85 annually. Asian, Asian-American, Native American, and Hispanic individuals have a lower VTE risk than Whites or Blacks. Populations in Asia have VTE rates at 15 to 20% of what is seen in Western countries.
Using blood thinners is the standard treatment. Typical medications include rivaroxaban, apixaban, and warfarin. Beginning warfarin treatment requires an additional non-oral anticoagulant, often injections of heparin. 

Prevention of VTE for the general population includes avoiding obesity and maintaining an active lifestyle. Preventive efforts following low-risk surgery include early and frequent walking. Riskier surgeries generally prevent VTE with a blood thinner or aspirin combined with intermittent pneumatic compression.
==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms classically affect a leg and typically develop over hours or days, though they can develop suddenly or over a matter of weeks. The legs are primarily affected, with 4–10% of DVT occurring in the arms. Despite the signs and symptoms being highly variable, the typical symptoms are pain, swelling, and redness. However, these symptoms might not manifest in the lower limbs of those unable to walk. In those who are able to walk, DVT can reduce one&#x27;s ability to do so. The pain can be described as throbbing and can worsen with weight-bearing, prompting one to bear more weight with the unaffected leg. 

Additional signs and symptoms include tenderness, pitting edema (&quot;see image&quot;), dilation of surface veins, warmth, discoloration, a &quot;pulling sensation&quot;, and even cyanosis (a blue or purplish discoloration) with fever. DVT can also exist without causing any symptoms. Signs and symptoms help in determining the likelihood of DVT, but they are not used alone for diagnosis.

At times, DVT can cause symptoms in both arms or both legs, as with bilateral DVT. Rarely, a clot in the inferior vena cava can cause both legs to swell. Superficial vein thrombosis, also known as superficial thrombophlebitis, is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a vein close to the skin. It can co-occur with DVT and can be felt as a &quot;palpable cord&quot;. Migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau&#x27;s syndrome) is a noted finding in those with pancreatic cancer and is associated with DVT.

===Potential complications===

A pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot from a deep vein (a DVT) detaches from a vein (embolizes), travels through the right side of the heart, and becomes lodged as an embolus in a pulmonary artery that supplies deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation. Up to one-fourth of PE cases are thought to result in sudden death. When not fatal, PE can cause symptoms such as sudden onset shortness of breath or chest pain, coughing up blood (hemoptysis), and fainting (syncope). The chest pain can be pleuritic (worsened by deep breaths) and can vary based upon where the embolus is lodged in the lungs. An estimated 30–50% of those with PE have detectable DVT by compression ultrasound.

A rare and massive DVT that causes significant obstruction and discoloration (including cyanosis) is phlegmasia cerulea dolens. It is life-threatening, limb-threatening, and carries a risk of venous gangrene. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens can occur in the arm but more commonly affects the leg. If found in the setting of acute compartment syndrome, an urgent fasciotomy is warranted to protect the limb. Superior vena cava syndrome is a rare complication of arm DVT.

DVT is thought to be able to cause a stroke in the presence of a heart defect. This is called a paradoxical embolism because the clot abnormally travels from the pulmonary circuit to the systemic circuit while inside the heart. The defect of a patent foramen ovale is thought to allow clots to travel through the interatrial septum from the right atrium into the left atrium.
===Differential diagnosis===
In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation. Cellulitis is a frequent mimic of DVT, with its triad of pain, swelling, and redness. Symptoms concerning for DVT are more often due to other causes, including cellulitis, ruptured Baker&#x27;s cyst, hematoma, lymphedema, and chronic venous insufficiency. Other differential diagnoses include tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, connective tissue disorders, superficial vein thrombosis, muscle vein thrombosis, and varicose veins.

==Classification==
DVT and PE are the two manifestations of the cardiovascular disease venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE can occur as DVT only, DVT with PE, or PE only. About two-thirds of VTE manifests as DVT only, with one-third manifesting as PE with or without DVT. VTE, along with superficial vein thrombosis, are common types of venous thrombosis.

DVT is classified as acute when the clots are developing or have recently developed, whereas chronic DVT persists more than 28 days. Differences between these two types of DVT can be seen with ultrasound. An episode of VTE after an initial one is classified as recurrent. Bilateral DVT refers to clots in both limbs while unilateral means only a single limb is affected.

DVT in a leg above the knee is termed proximal DVT (proximal). DVT in a leg below the knee is termed distal DVT (distal), also called &quot;calf DVT&quot; when affecting the calf, and has limited clinical significance compared to proximal DVT. Calf DVT makes up about half of DVTs. Iliofemoral DVT is described as involving either the iliac, or common femoral vein; elsewhere, it has been defined as involving at a minimum the common iliac vein, which is near the top of the pelvis.

DVT can be classified into provoked and unprovoked categories. For example, DVT that occurs in association with cancer or surgery can be classified as provoked. However, the European Society of Cardiology in 2019 urged for this dichotomy to be abandoned to encourage more personalized risk assessments for recurrent VTE. The distinction between these categories is not always clear.

==Causes==

Traditionally, the three factors of Virchow&#x27;s triad—venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and changes in the endothelial blood vessel lining—contribute to VTE and were used to explain its formation. More recently, inflammation has been identified as playing a clear causal role. Other related causes include activation of immune system components, the state of microparticles in the blood, the concentration of oxygen, and possible platelet activation. Various risk factors contribute to VTE, including genetic and environmental factors, though many with multiple risk factors never develop it.

Acquired risk factors include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood composition to favor clotting. Previous VTE, particularly unprovoked VTE, is a strong risk factor. A leftover clot from a prior DVT increases the risk of a subsequent DVT. Major surgery and trauma increase risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. Minor injuries, lower limb amputation, hip fracture, and long bone fractures are also risks. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis can be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow as part of the procedure. Inactivity and immobilization contribute to venous stasis, as with orthopedic casts, paralysis, sitting, long-haul travel, bed rest, hospitalization, catatonia, and in survivors of acute stroke. Conditions that involve compromised blood flow in the veins are May–Thurner syndrome, where a vein of the pelvis is compressed, and venous thoracic outlet syndrome, which includes Paget–Schroetter syndrome, where compression occurs near the base of the neck.

Infections, including sepsis, COVID-19, HIV, and active tuberculosis, increase risk. Chronic inflammatory diseases and some autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic sclerosis, Behçet&#x27;s syndrome, primary antiphospholipid syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) increase risk. SLE itself is frequently associated with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome.

Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Cancers of the blood, lung, pancreas, brain, stomach, and bowel are associated with high VTE risk. Solid tumors such as adenocarcinomas can contribute to both VTE and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In severe cases, this can lead to simultaneous clotting and bleeding. Chemotherapy treatment also increases risk. Obesity increases the potential of blood to clot, as does pregnancy. In the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.

Dozens of genetic risk factors have been identified, and they account for approximately 50 to 60% of the variability in VTE rates. As such, family history of VTE is a risk factor for a first VTE. Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, mildly increases VTE risk by about three times. Deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—contribute to VTE. These deficiencies in antithrombin, protein C, and protein S are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors. They increase risk by about 10 times. Having a non-O blood type roughly doubles VTE risk. Non-O blood type is common globally, making it an important risk factor. Individuals without O blood type have higher blood levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII than those with O blood type, increasing the likelihood of clotting. Those homozygous for the common fibrinogen gamma gene variant rs2066865 have about a 1.6 times higher risk of VTE. The genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which increases prothrombin levels, increases risk by about 2.5 times. Additionally, approximately 5% of people have been identified with a background genetic risk comparable to the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations.

Blood alterations including dysfibrinogenemia, low free protein S, activated protein C resistance, homocystinuria, hyperhomocysteinemia, high fibrinogen levels, high factor IX levels, and high factor XI levels are associated with increased risk. Other associated conditions include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, intravenous drug use, and smoking.

Some risk factors influence the location of DVT within the body. In isolated distal DVT, the profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal DVT. Transient factors, such as surgery and immobilization, appear to dominate, whereas thrombophilias and age do not seem to increase risk. Common risk factors for having an upper extremity DVT include having an existing foreign body (such as a central venous catheter, a pacemaker, or a triple-lumen PICC line), cancer, and recent surgery.

==Pathophysiology==

Blood has a natural tendency to clot when blood vessels are damaged (hemostasis) to minimize blood loss. Clotting is activated by the coagulation cascade and the clearing of clots that are no longer needed is accomplished by the process of fibrinolysis. Reductions in fibrinolysis or increases in coagulation can increase the risk of DVT.

DVT often develops in the calf veins and &quot;grows&quot; in the direction of venous flow, towards the heart. DVT most frequently affects veins in the leg or pelvis including the popliteal vein (behind the knee), femoral vein (of the thigh), and iliac veins of the pelvis. Extensive lower-extremity DVT can even reach into the inferior vena cava (in the abdomen). Upper extremity DVT most commonly affects the subclavian, axillary, and jugular veins.

The process of fibrinolysis, where DVT clots can be dissolved back into the blood, acts to temper the process of thrombus growth. This is the preferred process. Aside from the potentially deadly process of embolization, a clot can resolve through organization, which can damage the valves of veins, cause vein fibrosis, and result in non-compliant veins. Organization of a thrombus into the vein can occur at the third stage of its pathological development, in which collagen becomes the characteristic component. The first pathological stage is marked by red blood cells, and the second is characterized by medium-textured fibrin.

In arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such mechanical damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis is thought to arise from &quot;activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes, with initiation of inflammation and formation of microparticles that trigger the coagulation system&quot; via tissue factor. Vein wall inflammation is likely the inciting event. Importantly, the activated endothelium of veins interacts with circulating white blood cells (leukocytes). While leukocytes normally help prevent blood from clotting (as does normal endothelium), upon stimulation, leukocytes facilitate clotting. Neutrophils are recruited early in the process of venous thrombi formation. They release pro-coagulant granules and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) or their components, which play a role in venous thrombi formation. NET components are pro-thrombotic through both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways. NETs provide &quot;a scaffold for adhesion&quot; of platelets, red blood cells, and multiple factors that potentiate platelet activation. In addition to the pro-coagulant activities of neutrophils, multiple stimuli cause monocytes to release tissue factor. Monocytes are also recruited early in the process.

Tissue factor, via the tissue factor–factor VIIa complex, activates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Fresh venous clots are red blood cell and fibrin rich. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they can play a role. In cancer, tissue factor is produced by cancer cells. Cancer also produces unique substances that stimulate factor Xa, cytokines that promote endothelial dysfunction, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which inhibits the breakdown of clots (fibrinolysis).
Often, DVT begins in the valves of veins. The blood flow pattern in the valves can cause low oxygen concentrations in the blood (hypoxemia) of a valve sinus. Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1. Hypoxemia also results in the production of reactive oxygen species, which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.

D-dimers are a fibrin degradation product, a natural byproduct of fibrinolysis that is typically found in the blood. An elevated level can result from plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. Anticoagulation, the standard treatment for DVT, prevents further clot growth and PE, but does not act directly on existing clots.

==Diagnosis==

A clinical probability assessment using the Wells score (see column in the table below) to determine if a potential DVT is &quot;likely&quot; or &quot;unlikely&quot; is typically the first step of the diagnostic process. The score is used in suspected first lower extremity DVT (without any PE symptoms) in primary care and outpatient settings, including the emergency department. The numerical result (possible score −2 to 9) is most commonly grouped into either &quot;unlikely&quot; or &quot;likely&quot; categories. A Wells score of two or more means DVT is considered &quot;likely&quot; (about a 28% chance), while those with a lower score are considered &quot;unlikely&quot; to have DVT (about a 6% chance). In those unlikely to have DVT, a diagnosis is excluded by a negative D-dimer blood test. In people with likely DVT, ultrasound is the standard imaging used to confirm or exclude a diagnosis. Imaging is also needed for hospital inpatients with suspected DVT and those initially categorized as unlikely to have DVT but who have a positive D-dimer test.

While the Wells score is the predominant and most studied clinical prediction rule for DVT, it does have drawbacks. The Wells score requires a subjective assessment regarding the likelihood of an alternate diagnosis and performs less well in the elderly and those with a prior DVT. The Dutch Primary Care Rule has also been validated for use. It contains only objective criteria but requires obtaining a D-dimer value. With this prediction rule, three points or less means a person is at low risk for DVT. A result of four or more points indicates an ultrasound is needed. Instead of using a prediction rule, experienced physicians can make a DVT pre-test probability assessment using clinical assessment and gestalt, but prediction rules are more reliable.

Compression ultrasonography for suspected deep vein thrombosis is the standard diagnostic method, and it is highly sensitive for detecting an initial DVT. A compression ultrasound is considered positive when the vein walls of normally compressible veins do not collapse under gentle pressure. Clot visualization is sometimes possible, but is not required. Three compression ultrasound scanning techniques can be used, with two of the three methods requiring a second ultrasound some days later to rule out the diagnosis. Whole-leg ultrasound is the option that does not require a repeat ultrasound, but proximal compression ultrasound is frequently used because distal DVT is only rarely clinically significant. Ultrasound methods including duplex and color flow Doppler can be used to further characterize the clot and Doppler ultrasound is especially helpful in the non-compressible iliac veins.

CT scan venography, MRI venography, or a non-contrast MRI are also diagnostic possibilities. The gold standard for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, this test is rarely performed.

==Management==

Treatment for DVT is warranted when the clots are either proximal, distal and symptomatic, or upper extremity and symptomatic. Providing anticoagulation, or blood-thinning medicine, is the typical treatment after patients are checked to make sure they are not subject to bleeding. However, treatment varies depending upon the location of DVT. For example, in cases of isolated distal DVT, ultrasound surveillance (a second ultrasound after 2 weeks to check for proximal clots), might be used instead of anticoagulation. Although, those with isolated distal DVT at a high risk of VTE recurrence are typically anticoagulated as if they had proximal DVT. Those at a low risk for recurrence might receive a four- to six-week course of anticoagulation, lower doses, or no anticoagulation at all. In contrast, those with proximal DVT should receive at least 3 months of anticoagulation.

Some anticoagulants can be taken by mouth, and these oral medicines include warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist), rivaroxaban (a factor Xa inhibitor), apixaban (a factor Xa inhibitor), dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor), and edoxaban (a factor Xa inhibitor). Other anticoagulants cannot be taken by mouth. These parenteral (non-oral) medicines include low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, and unfractionated heparin. Some oral medicines are sufficient when taken alone, while others require the use of an additional parenteral blood thinner. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are the typical first-line medicines, and they are sufficient when taken orally. Rivaroxaban is taken once daily, and apixaban is taken twice daily. Warfarin, dabigatran, and edoxaban require the use of a parenteral anticoagulant to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy. When warfarin is initiated for VTE treatment, a 5-day minimum of a parenteral anticoagulant together with warfarin is given, which is followed by warfarin-only therapy. Warfarin is taken to maintain an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking warfarin declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age. Periodic INR monitoring is not necessary when first-line direct oral anticoagulants are used. Overall, anticoagulation therapy is complex, and many circumstances can affect how these therapies are managed.

The duration of anticoagulation therapy (whether it will last 4 to 6 weeks, 6 to 12 weeks, 3 to 6 months, or indefinitely) is a key factor in clinical decision making. When proximal DVT is provoked by surgery or trauma a 3-month course of anticoagulation is standard. When a first VTE is proximal DVT that is either unprovoked or associated with transient non-surgical risk factor, low-dose anticoagulation beyond 3 to 6 months might be used. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish warfarin treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show an increased risk of recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision making. Thrombophilia test results rarely play a role in the length of treatment.

Treatment for acute leg DVT is suggested to continue at home for uncomplicated DVT instead of hospitalization. Factors that favor hospitalization include severe symptoms or additional medical issues. Early walking is suggested over bedrest. Graduated compression stockings—which apply higher pressure at the ankles and a lower pressure around the knees can be trialed for symptomatic management of acute DVT symptoms, but they are not recommended for reducing the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome, as the potential benefit of using them for this goal &quot;may be uncertain&quot;. Nor are compression stockings likely to reduce VTE recurrence. They are, however, recommended in those with isolated distal DVT.

If someone decides to stop anticoagulation after an unprovoked VTE instead of being on lifelong anticoagulation, aspirin can be used to reduce the risk of recurrence, but it is only about 33% as effective as anticoagulation in preventing recurrent VTE. Statins have also been investigated for their potential to reduce recurrent VTE rates, with some studies suggesting effectiveness.

===Investigations for cancer===

An unprovoked VTE might signal the presence of an unknown cancer, as it is an underlying condition in up to 10% of unprovoked cases. A thorough clinical assessment is needed and should include a physical examination, a review of medical history, and universal cancer screening done in people of that age. A review of prior imaging is considered worthwhile, as is &quot;reviewing baseline blood test results including full blood count, renal and hepatic function, PT and APTT.&quot; It is not recommended practice to obtain tumor markers or a CT of the abdomen and pelvis in asymptomatic individuals. NICE recommends that further investigations are unwarranted in those without relevant signs or symptoms.

===Interventions===

Thrombolysis is the injection of an enzyme into the veins to dissolve blood clots, and while this treatment has been proven effective against the life-threatening emergency clots of stroke and heart attacks, randomized controlled trials have not established a net benefit in those with acute proximal DVT. Drawbacks of catheter-directed thrombolysis (the preferred method of administering the clot-busting enzyme) include a risk of bleeding, complexity, and the cost of the procedure. Although, while anticoagulation is the preferred treatment for DVT, thrombolysis is a treatment option for those with the severe DVT form of phlegmasia cerula dorens (&quot;bottom left image&quot;) and in some younger patients with DVT affecting the iliac and common femoral veins. Of note, a variety of contraindications to thrombolysis exist. In 2020, NICE kept their 2012 recommendations that catheter-directed thrombolysis should be considered in those with iliofemoral DVT who have &quot;symptoms lasting less than 14 days, good functional status, a life expectancy of 1 year or more, and a low risk of bleeding.&quot;

A mechanical thrombectomy device can remove DVT clots, particularly in acute iliofemoral DVT (DVT of the major veins in the pelvis), but there is limited data on its efficacy. It is usually combined with thrombolysis, and sometimes temporary IVC filters are placed to protect against PE during the procedure. Catheter-directed thrombolysis with thrombectomy against iliofemoral DVT has been associated with a reduction in the severity of post-thrombotic syndrome at an estimated cost-effectiveness ratio of about $138,000 per gained QALY. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens might be treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy.

In DVT in the arm, the first (topmost) rib can be surgically removed as part of the typical treatment when the DVT is due to thoracic outlet syndrome or Paget–Schroetter syndrome. This treatment involves initial anticoagulation followed by thrombolysis of the subclavian vein and staged first rib resection to relieve the thoracic outlet compression and prevent recurrent DVT.


The placement of an inferior vena cava filter (IVC filter) is possible when either the standard treatment for acute DVT, anticoagulation, is absolutely contraindicated (not possible), or if someone develops a PE despite being anticoagulated. However, a 2020 NICE review found &quot;little good evidence&quot; for their use. A 2018 study associated IVC filter placement with a 50% reduction in PE, a 70% increase in DVT, and an 18% increase in 30 day mortality when compared to no IVC placement. Other studies including a systematic review and meta-analysis did not find a difference in mortality with IVC placement. If someone develops a PE despite being anticoagulated, care should be given to optimize anticoagulation treatment and address other related concerns before considering IVC filter placement.

===Field of medicine===
Patients with a history of DVT might be managed by primary care, general internal medicine, hematology, cardiology, vascular surgery, or vascular medicine. Patients suspected of having an acute DVT are often referred to the emergency department for evaluation. Interventional radiology is the specialty that typically places and retrieves IVC filters, and vascular surgery might do catheter directed thrombosis for some severe DVTs.

==Prevention==
For the prevention of blood clots in the general population, incorporating leg exercises while sitting down for long periods, or having breaks from a sitting position and walking around, having an active lifestyle, and maintaining a healthy body weight are recommended. Walking increases blood flow through the leg veins. Excess body weight is modifiable unlike most risk factors, and interventions or lifestyle modifications that help someone who is overweight or obese lose weight reduce DVT risk. Avoiding both smoking and a Western pattern diet are thought to reduce risk. Statins have been investigated for primary prevention (prevention of a first VTE), and the JUPITER trial, which used rosuvastatin, has provided some tentative evidence of effectiveness. Of the statins, rosuvastatin appears to be the only one with the potential to reduce VTE risk. If so, it appears to reduce risk by about 15%. However, the number needed to treat to prevent one initial VTE is about 2000, limiting its applicability.

===Hospital (non-surgical) patients===

Acutely ill hospitalized patients are suggested to receive a parenteral anticoagulant, although the potential net benefit is uncertain. Critically ill hospitalized patients are recommended to either receive unfractionated heparin or low-molecular weight heparin instead of foregoing these medicines. 

===After surgery===

Major orthopedic surgery—total hip replacement, total knee replacement, or hip fracture surgery—has a high risk of causing VTE. If prophylaxis is not used after these surgeries, symptomatic VTE has about a 4% chance of developing within 35 days. Following major orthopedic surgery, a blood thinner or aspirin is typically paired with intermittent pneumatic compression, which is the preferred mechanical prophylaxis over graduated compression stockings.

Options for VTE prevention in people following non-orthopedic surgery include early walking, mechanical prophylaxis, and blood thinners (low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose-unfractionated heparin) depending upon the risk of VTE, risk of major bleeding, and person&#x27;s preferences. After low-risk surgeries, early and frequent walking is the best preventive measure.

===Pregnancy===

The risk of VTE is increased in pregnancy by about four to five times because of a more hypercoagulable state that protects against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Preventive measures for pregnancy-related VTE were suggested by the American Society of Hematology in 2018. Warfarin, a common vitamin K antagonist, can cause birth defects and is not used for prevention during pregnancy.

===Travelers===

Travelling &quot;is an often cited yet relatively uncommon&quot; cause of VTE. Suggestions for at-risk long-haul travelers include calf exercises, frequent walking, and aisle seating in airplanes to ease walking. Graduated compression stockings have sharply reduced the levels of asymptomatic DVT in airline passengers, but the effect on symptomatic DVT, PE, or mortality is unknown, as none of the individuals studied developed these outcomes. However, graduated compression stockings are not suggested for long-haul travelers (&gt;4 hours) without risk factors for VTE. Likewise, neither aspirin nor anticoagulants are suggested in the general population undertaking long-haul travel. Those with significant VTE risk factors undertaking long-haul travel are suggested to use either graduated compression stockings or LMWH for VTE prevention. If neither of these two methods are feasible, then aspirin is suggested.

==Prognosis==
DVT is most frequently a disease of older age that occurs in the context of nursing homes, hospitals, and active cancer. It is associated with a 30-day mortality rate of about 6%, with PE being the cause of most of these deaths. Proximal DVT is frequently associated with PE, unlike distal DVT, which is rarely if ever associated with PE. Around 56% of those with proximal DVT also have PE, although a chest CT is not needed simply because of the presence of DVT. If proximal DVT is left untreated, in the following 3 months approximately half of people will experience symptomatic PE.

Another frequent complication of proximal DVT, and the most frequent chronic complication, is post-thrombotic syndrome, where individuals have chronic venous symptoms. Symptoms can include pain, itching, swelling, paresthesia, a sensation of heaviness, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. After proximal DVT, an estimated 20–50% of people develop the syndrome, with 5–10% experiencing severe symptoms. Post-thrombotic syndrome can also be a complication of distal DVT, though to a lesser extent than with proximal DVT.

In the 10 years following an initial VTE, about 30% of people will have a recurrence. VTE recurrence in those with prior DVT is more likely to recur as DVT than PE. Cancer and unprovoked DVT are strong risk factors for recurrence. After initial proximal unprovoked DVT with and without PE, 16–17% of people will have recurrent VTE in the 2 years after they complete their course of anticoagulants. VTE recurrence is less common in distal DVT than proximal DVT. In upper extremity DVT, annual VTE recurrence is about 2–4%. After surgery, a provoked proximal DVT or PE has an annual recurrence rate of only 0.7%.

==Epidemiology==

About 1.5 out of 1000 adults a year have a first VTE in high-income countries. The condition becomes much more common with age. VTE rarely occurs in children, but when it does, it predominantly affects hospitalized children. Children in North America and the Netherlands have VTE rates that range from 0.07 to 0.49 out of 10,000 children annually. Meanwhile, almost 1% of those aged 85 and above experience VTE each year. About 60% of all VTEs occur in those 70 years of age or older. Incidence is about 18% higher in males than in females, though there are ages when VTE is more prevalent in women. VTE occurs in association with hospitalization or nursing home residence about 60% of the time, active cancer about 20% of the time, and a central venous catheter or transvenous pacemaker about 9% of the time.

During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs in about 1.2 of 1000 deliveries. Despite it being relatively rare, it is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. After surgery with preventive treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 400,000 Americans develop an initial VTE each year, with 100,000 deaths or more attributable to PE. Asian, Asian-American, Native American, and Hispanic individuals have a lower VTE risk than Whites or Blacks. Populations in Asia have VTE rates at 15 to 20% of what is seen in Western countries, with an increase in incidence seen over time. In North American and European populations, around 4–8% of people have a thrombophilia, most commonly factor V leiden and prothrombin G20210A. For populations in China, Japan, and Thailand, deficiences in protein S, protein C, and antithrombin predominate. Non-O blood type is present in around 50% of the general population and varies with ethnicity, and it is present in about 70% of those with VTE.

DVT occurs in the upper extremities in about 4–10% of cases, with an incidence of 0.4–1.0 people out of 10,000 a year. A minority of upper extremity DVTs are due to Paget–Schroetter syndrome, also called effort thrombosis, which occurs in 1–2 people out of 100,000 a year, usually in athletic males around 30 years of age or in those who do significant amounts of overhead manual labor.

==Social==
Being on blood thinners because of DVT can be life-changing because it can prevent lifestyle activities such as contact or winter sports to prevent bleeding after potential injuries. Head injuries prompting brain bleeds are of particular concern. This has caused NASCAR driver Brian Vickers to forego participation in races. Professional basketball players including NBA players Victor Wembanyama, Chris Bosh, and hall of famer Hakeem Olajuwon have dealt with recurrent blood clots, and Bosh&#x27;s career was significantly hampered by DVT and PE.

Tennis star Serena Williams was hospitalized in 2011 for PE thought to have originated from DVT. Years later, in 2017, due to her knowledge of DVT and PE, Serena accurately advocated for herself to have a PE diagnosed and treated. During this encounter with VTE, she was hospitalized after a C-section surgery and was off of blood thinners. After feeling the sudden onset of a PE symptom, shortness of breath, she told her nurse and requested a CT scan and an IV heparin drip, all while gasping for air. She started to receive an ultrasound to look for DVT in the legs, prompting her to express dissatisfaction to the medical staff that they were not looking for clots where she had symptoms (her lungs), and they were not yet treating her presumed PE. After being diagnosed with PE and not DVT, and after receiving heparin by IV, the coughing from the PE caused her C-section surgical site to open and the heparin contributed to bleeding at the site. Serena later received an IVC filter while in the hospital.

Other notable people have been affected by DVT. Former United States President Richard Nixon had recurrent DVT, and so has former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She was first diagnosed while First Lady in 1998 and again in 2009. Dick Cheney was diagnosed with an episode while Vice President, and TV show host Regis Philbin had DVT after hip-replacement surgery. DVT has also contributed to the deaths of famous people. For example, DVT and PE played a role in rapper Heavy D&#x27;s death at age 44. NBC journalist David Bloom died at age 39 while covering the Iraq War from a PE that was thought to have progressed from a missed DVT, and actor Jimmy Stewart had DVT that progressed to a PE when he was 89.

===History===

The book &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;, an Ayurvedic text published around 600–900 BC, contains what has been cited as the first description of DVT. In 1271, DVT symptoms in the leg of a 20-year-old male were described in a French manuscript, which has been cited as the first case or the first Western reference to DVT.

In 1856, German physician and pathologist Rudolf Virchow published his analysis after the insertion of foreign bodies into the jugular veins of dogs, which migrated to the pulmonary arteries. These foreign bodies caused pulmonary emboli, and Virchow was focused on explaining their consequences. He cited three factors, which are now understood as hypercoagulability, stasis, and endothelial injury. It was not until 1950 that this framework was cited as Virchow&#x27;s triad, but the teaching of Virchow&#x27;s triad has continued in light of its utility as a theoretical framework and as a recognition of the significant progress Virchow made in expanding the understanding of VTE.

Methods to observe DVT by ultrasound were established in the 1960s. Diagnoses were commonly performed by impedance plethysmography in the 1970s and 1980s, but ultrasound, particularly after utility of probe compression was demonstrated in 1986, became the preferred diagnostic method. Yet, in the mid-1990s, contrast venography and impedance plethysmography were still described as common.
Multiple pharmacological therapies for DVT were introduced in the 20th century: oral anticoagulants in the 1940s, subcutaneous injections of LDUH in 1962 and subcutaneous injections of LMWH in 1982. 1974 was when vascular inflammation and venous thrombosis were first proposed to be interrelated. For around 50 years, a months-long warfarin (Coumadin) regimen was the mainstay of pharmacological treatment. To avoid the blood monitoring required with warfarin and the injections required by heparin and heparin-like medicines, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were developed. In the late 2000s to early 2010s, DOACs—including rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), and dabigatran (Pradaxa)—came to the market. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described a &quot;furious battle&quot; among the three makers of these drugs &quot;for the prescription pads of doctors&quot;.

===Economics===
VTE costs the US healthcare system about $7 to 10 billion dollars annually. Initial and average DVT costs for a hospitalized US patient is about $10,000 (2015 estimate). In Europe, the costs for an initial VTE hospitalization are significantly less, costing about €2000 to 4000 (2011 estimate). Post-thrombotic syndrome is a significant contributor to DVT follow-up costs. Outpatient treatment significantly reduces costs, and treatment costs for PE exceed those of DVT.

==Research directions==
A 2019 study published in &quot;Nature Genetics&quot; reported more than doubling the known genetic loci associated with VTE. In their updated 2018 clinical practice guidelines, the American Society of Hematology identified 29 separate research priorities, most of which related to patients who are acutely or critically ill. Inhibition of factor XI, P-selectin, E-selectin, and a reduction in formation of neutrophil extracellular traps are potential therapies that might treat VTE without increasing bleeding risk.

<text>Psusennes III was the High Priest of Amun at Thebes (976 – 943 BC) at the end of the 21st Dynasty. Little is known of this individual; he is thought by some to be the same person as pharaoh Psusennes II. His name appears on a document found at the &#x27;mummy cache&#x27; DB320, which describes him as a son of the High Priest Pinedjem II. This makes him a possible candidate for Psusennes II because Pinedjem II died in Year 10 of Siamun, who was the immediate predecessor of this pharaoh.

<text>The British Association of Nature Conservationists (BANC) publish &quot;ECOS&quot; academic journal. 

BANC and ECOS were born out of the Masters in Conservation at University College, London, by committed volunteers keen to raise the profile of the environment to new audiences in political, social and economic circles.

From these informal beginnings, BANC became a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee in 1987. Leading conservationists welcomed the energy and enterprise that brought BANC into being. RSPB&#x27;s Director General, Ian Prestt, was amongst early supporters, and became a Vice-President. Norman W. Moore, the Nature Conservancy Council&#x27;s Chief Advisory Officer, also became a Vice President. Max Nicholson was interviewed for a notable article in the first edition of ECOS. As the first organisation to link the conservation of nature to politics, social issues and economics before the mainstreaming of environmental concerns, BANC&#x27;s advent was widely welcomed. The ecosystem is a very complex thing.

BANC&#x27;s track record of engaging leading thinkers to analyse current and future trends and opportunities in conservation began early in the organisation&#x27;s history: Implementing the Act: A study of habitat protection under Section II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was written in 1984 by William Adams, later Professor of Geography at the University of Cambridge. This was followed by a series of critically acclaimed publications addressing issues relevant to the development of nature conservation that have influenced conservation thinking and activity.

==ECOS==
Ecos is an online journal by BANC. The magazine was founded in 1974. It was a print quarterly journal until 2011 when it went online. The online journal is published three times a year. The journal publishes articles on nature conservation-related topics.

<text>Gland () is a municipality in the district of Nyon in the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. The city also is home to the IUCN and WWF headquarters.

== History ==
Gland is known to have been a prehistoric settlement. During the Roman period a farm called &quot;Villa Glanis&quot; was there. Until the 1960s, Gland was merely a small farming village (essentially vineyards and cattle).

Gland is first mentioned around 994–1049 CE as &quot;de Glans&quot;.

In 1923 Gland provided the venue for the European Division meeting of the Seventh-day Adventists, where the German Adventist leaders said they regarded whether to serve as combatant in times of war was a matter which should be left to the conscience of individual members of their church.

In the 1930s, the Toblerone line, a defensive line, was built along the western edge of Gland, stretching from Lac Léman towards the Jura mountains. Its purpose was to stop a tank invasion from the west.

The opening of the highway linking Geneva with Lausanne brought many commuters to this once-quiet place. It is only since the mid-1980s that Gland has started to grow into a town with its own businesses and shopping centers.

<doc id="570169" wikidata="Q7624088" url="?curid=570169" title="Strip mall">
<text>A strip mall, strip center, strip plaza or simply plaza is a type of shopping center common in North America and Australia where the stores are arranged in a row, with a footpath in front. Strip malls are typically developed as a unit and have large parking lots in front. Many of them face major traffic arterials and tend to be self-contained with few pedestrian connections to surrounding neighborhoods. Smaller strip malls may be called mini-malls, while larger ones may be called power centers or &quot;big box centers&quot;. In 2013, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the United States had 65,840 strip malls. In 2020, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that in the United States, despite the continuing retail apocalypse that started in around 2010, investments and visitor numbers were increasing to strip malls. In 2024 the number of strip malls in the United States had grown to more than 68,000 nationwide.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland such malls are called retail parks or retail outlets. They are usually located on the outskirts of towns and cities, and serve as an alternative to the high street in the UK or main street in Ireland. Retail parks have become popular due to the widespread use of cars and the ability to park close to the shops as opposed to restricted parking on high streets, many of which are pedestrianised.

In Australia &quot;strip shops&quot; or &quot;shopping centre&quot; describes a line of independent shops and buildings along the principal streets of a city or suburban area, which are not set back from the pavement (footpath) and do not have dedicated car parking spaces.

==Classification==
Strip malls and retail parks often range in size from to over . 

In the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) classification of shopping centers, U.S. and Canadian strip malls may fit the definition of:
*Neighborhood shopping center () 
*Power centers which may reach .
*Other categories, depending on the size and characteristics

Note that ICSC classifications vary slightly for Europe as well as for Asia Pacific.

==History==

The Park and Shop in Cleveland Park, Washington, D.C. opened in 1930, anchored by a Piggly Wiggly supermarket. It was built in an L shape with dedicated parking space for shoppers in the front, a novelty at the time. The center still exists as of 2020, anchored by a Target store and measuring .

==Types==
===Mini-mall/strip plaza===
The smaller variety is more common and often located at the intersection of major streets in residential areas; it caters to a small residential area. This type of strip mall or plaza is found in nearly every city or town in the United States and Canada; it is service-oriented and may contain a grocery store, hair salon, dry cleaner, laundromat, small restaurant, discount stores, variety stores, and similar stores such as a general store, toy store, pet store, jewelry store, mattress store, convenience store, thrift shop, or pawn shop. In the past, pharmacies were often located next to the grocery stores, but are now often free-standing or contained within the anchor tenant (e.g. Walmart, Target) or grocery store. Gas stations, banks, and other businesses also may have their own free-standing buildings in the parking lot of the strip center.

====Mini-malls in Los Angeles====
The mini-mall in Los Angeles is seen as the descendant of the drive-in markets with multiple independent vendors that appeared in the area in the 1920s. The 1973 oil crisis bankrupted many gas stations, freeing up their corner lots for redevelopment. La Mancha developers built the first modern-style mini-mall – a few stores with parking in front – in Panorama City, Los Angeles in 1973, with over 600 to follow in the metropolitan area. The proliferation of mini-malls from that time into the 1980s led to a 1988 anti-mini-mall ordinance in Los Angeles.

===Big box center/power center===
The other variety of strip mall in the United States is usually anchored on one end by a big box retailer, such as Walmart, Kohl&#x27;s, or Target, and/or by a large supermarket like Kroger, Publix or Winn-Dixie on the other. They are usually referred to as power centers in the real estate development industry because they attract and cater to residents of an expanded population area. The categories of retailers may vary widely, from electronics stores to bookstores to home improvement stores, dollar stores, and boutiques. There are typically only a few of this type of strip malls in a city, compared to the smaller types. Retailers vary from center to center, ranging from three or four large retailers to a dozen or more. Some strip malls are s of these types.

<doc id="570172" wikidata="Q1197176" url="?curid=570172" title="Airspeed">
<text>In aviation, airspeed is the speed of an aircraft relative to the air it is flying through (which itself is usually moving relative to the ground due to wind). In contrast, the ground speed is the speed of an aircraft with respect to the surface of the Earth (whether over land or presumed-stationary water). It is difficult to measure the exact airspeed of the aircraft (true airspeed), but other measures of airspeed, such as indicated airspeed and Mach number give useful information about the capabilities and limitations of airplane performance. The common measures of airspeed are:

* Indicated airspeed (IAS), what is read on an airspeed gauge connected to a pitot-static system.
* Calibrated airspeed (CAS), indicated airspeed adjusted for pitot system position and installation error. 
* True airspeed (TAS) is the actual speed the airplane is moving through the air. When combined with aircraft direction, wind speed and direction, it can be used to calculate ground speed and direction.
* Equivalent airspeed (EAS) is true airspeed times root density ratio. It is a useful way of calculating aerodynamic loads and airplane performance at low speeds when the flow can be considered incompressible.
* Mach number is a measure of how fast the airplane is flying relative to the speed of sound.

The measurement and indication of airspeed is ordinarily accomplished on board an aircraft by an airspeed indicator (ASI) connected to a pitot-static system. The pitot-static system comprises one or more pitot probes (or tubes) facing the on-coming air flow to measure pitot pressure (also called stagnation, total or ram pressure) and one or more static ports to measure the static pressure in the air flow. These two pressures are compared by the ASI to give an IAS reading. Airspeed indicators are designed to give true airspeed at sea level pressure and standard temperature. As the aircraft climbs into less dense air, its true airspeed is greater than the airspeed indicated on the ASI.

Calibrated airspeed is typically within a few knots of indicated airspeed, while equivalent airspeed decreases slightly from CAS as aircraft altitude increases or at high speeds.

== Units ==
Airspeed is commonly given in knots (kn). Since 2010, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recommends using kilometers per hour (km/h) for airspeed (and meters per second for wind speed on runways), but allows using the de facto standard of knots, and has no set date on when to stop.

Depending on the country of manufacture or which era in aviation history, airspeed indicators on aircraft instrument panels have been configured to read in knots, kilometers per hour, miles per hour. In high altitude flight, the Mach number is sometimes used for reporting airspeed.

==Indicated airspeed==
Indicated airspeed (IAS) is the airspeed indicator reading (ASIR) uncorrected for instrument, position, and other errors. From current EASA definitions: Indicated airspeed means the speed of an aircraft as shown on its pitot static airspeed indicator calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic compressible flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.

An airspeed indicator is a differential pressure gauge with the pressure reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed is derived from the difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or stagnation pressure, and the static pressure. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in &quot;uncoordinated&quot; flight.

===Uses of indicated airspeed===
Indicated airspeed is a better measure of power required and lift available than true airspeed. Therefore, IAS is used for controlling the aircraft during taxiing, takeoff, climb, descent, approach or landing. Target speeds for best rate of climb, best range, and best endurance are given in terms of indicated speed. The airspeed structural limit, beyond which the forces on panels may become too high or wing flutter may occur, is often given in terms of IAS.

==Calibrated airspeed==

Calibrated airspeed (CAS) is indicated airspeed corrected for instrument errors, position error (due to incorrect pressure at the static port) and installation errors.

Calibrated airspeed values less than the speed of sound at standard sea level (661.4788 knots) are calculated as follows:

formula_1 minus position and installation error correction.

;where
:formula_2 is the calibrated airspeed,
:formula_3 is speed of sound at standard sea level
:formula_4 is the ratio of specific heats (1.4 for air)
:formula_5 is the impact pressure, the difference between total pressure and static pressure
:formula_6 is the static air pressure at standard sea level

This expression is based on the form of Bernoulli&#x27;s equation applicable to isentropic compressible flow. CAS is the same as true air speed at sea level standard conditions, but becomes smaller relative to true airspeed as we climb into lower pressure and cooler air. Nevertheless, it remains a good measure of the forces acting on the airplane, meaning stall speeds can be called out on the airspeed indicator. The values for formula_7 and formula_8 are consistent with the ISA i.e. the conditions under which airspeed indicators are calibrated.

==True airspeed==

The true airspeed (TAS; also KTAS, for &quot;knots true airspeed&quot;) of an aircraft is the speed of the aircraft relative to the air in which it is flying. The true airspeed and heading of an aircraft constitute its velocity relative to the atmosphere.

===Uses of true airspeed===

The true airspeed is important information for accurate navigation of an aircraft. To maintain a desired ground track whilst flying in a moving airmass, the pilot of an aircraft must use knowledge of wind speed, wind direction, and true air speed to determine the required heading. See wind triangle.

TAS is the appropriate speed to use when calculating the range of an airplane. It is the speed normally listed on the flight plan, also used in flight planning, before considering the effects of wind.

===Measurement of true airspeed===

True airspeed is calculated from calibrated airspeed as follows

formula_9

where
:formula_10 is true airspeed
:formula_11 is the temperature ratio, namely local over standard sea level temperature, formula_12

Some airspeed indicators include a TAS scale, which is set by entering outside air temperature and pressure altitude. Alternatively, TAS can be calculated using an E6B flight calculator or equivalent, given inputs of CAS, outside air temperature (OAT) and pressure altitude.

==Equivalent airspeed==
Equivalent airspeed (EAS) is defined as the airspeed at sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere at which the (incompressible) dynamic pressure is the same as the dynamic pressure at the true airspeed (TAS) and altitude at which the aircraft is flying. That is, it is defined by the equation

formula_13

where
:formula_14 is equivalent airspeed
:formula_10 is true airspeed
:formula_16 is the density of air at the altitude at which the aircraft is currently flying;
:formula_17 is the density of air at sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere (1.225 kg/m3 or 0.00237 slug/ft3).

Stated differently,

:formula_18

where
:formula_19 is the density ratio, that is formula_20

===Uses of equivalent airspeed===
EAS is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. Thus, the handling and &#x27;feel&#x27; of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.

At standard sea level pressure, CAS and EAS are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS diverges from EAS due to compressibility.

==Mach number==
Mach number formula_21 is defined as

formula_22

where
:formula_23 is true airspeed
:formula_24 is the local speed of sound

Both the Mach number and the speed of sound can be computed using measurements of impact pressure, static pressure and outside air temperature.

===Uses of Mach number===
For aircraft that fly close to, but below the speed of sound (i.e. most civil jets) the compressibility speed limit is given in terms of Mach number. Beyond this speed, Mach buffet or stall or tuck may occur.

<doc id="570176" wikidata="Q7990498" url="?curid=570176" title="Whale Cove (Oregon)">
<text>Whale Cove is a small cove, approximately one-third of a mile (0.5 km) in diameter, located on the Pacific Coast of Oregon in the United States, approximately 1.4 mi (2.3 km) south of the city of Depoe Bay. The cove is located at approximately 44 deg 44 min N latitude.

The ocean portion of the cove is protected as a marine reserve, and land portions of the cove are protected as parts of Rocky Creek State Scenic Viewpoint and Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge.

==Central Oregon Drake landing theory==

British amateur historian Bob Ward first proposed in 1998 that Whale Cove was the location where Francis Drake spent portion of the summer of 1579 careening his boat during his circumnavigation undertaking. The location of Drake&#x27;s landing, at which he claimed a portion of the west coast of North America as &quot;New Albion&quot;, has gained the most support over the years among more than twenty other alternative sites compiled in Fringe theories on the location of New Albion. The Drake northern California landing theory careening site was officially recognized in 2012 and is located at the Drakes Bay Historic and Archaeological District National Landmark on the coast of Marin County. Canadian Sam Bawlf added his support for Whale Cove careening site in his 2003 book &quot;The Secret Voyage&quot;. Archeologist/historian Melissa Darby did similar in her 2019 book &quot;Thunder Go North&quot;.

Ward proposed Whale Cove as the actual spot of Drake&#x27;s landing based on its similarity to a 16th-century map made by Jodocus Hondius. Ward theorized that Drake may have conspired with Queen Elizabeth I to mislead the Spanish about the true location of the cove to keep the Spanish from discovering Puget Sound, which Ward believes that Drake thought was the Northwest Passage. By 1998, Drake biographer Harry Kelsey warned about the integrity of the final Hakluyt narrative hindered by the well established fact that the &quot;English authorities had determined to keep details of the voyage secret after Drake returned. []To accomplish their goal, English authorities gave out a series of changing and conflicting accounts&quot;.

One longstanding puzzling feature of the Hondius map is the small island on the peninsula protecting the cove. According to Ward, a narrow strip of the peninsula protecting Whale Cove &quot;has a strip through which water flows at high tide&quot; turning 80% of the peninsula into an island. Melissa Darby was adding much later on: &quot;The water is shallow over the reef. Over the last 430 years the direct force of the prevailing ocean waves and possible subduction from the 1700 earthquake has reduced this reef, but whether it was a rocky inlet just above sea level in Drake&#x27;s day and drawn on the Portus illustration can only be conjectured.&quot;

==Navigation==

Whale Cove is navigable only by an experienced crew: mariners are advised to stay at least offshore for the distance one mile north of Whale Cove to one mile south of Whale Cove. Though it was frequently used by smugglers to bring in Canadian whiskey during prohibition, Whale Cove is not considered a usable bay in most seasons, though in summer it can be calm with few breakers. Whale Cove was once known as Bootlegger Bay for being &quot;small and dangerous for mariners&quot;, therefore &quot;perfect for rumrunners smuggling Canadian whiskey into the Northwest&quot;.

<doc id="570193" wikidata="Q7187768" url="?curid=570193" title="Photographers of the American Civil War">
<text>The American Civil War was the most widely covered conflict of the 19th century. The images would provide posterity with a comprehensive visual record of the war and its leading figures, and make a powerful impression on the populace.
Something not generally known by the public is the fact that roughly 70% of the war&#x27;s documentary photography was captured by the twin lenses of a stereo camera. The American Civil War was the first war in history whose intimate reality would be brought home to the public, not only in newspaper depictions, album cards and cartes-de-visite, but in a popular new 3D format called a &quot;stereograph,&quot; &quot;stereocard&quot; or &quot;stereoview.&quot; Millions of these cards were produced and purchased by a public eager to experience the nature of warfare in a whole new way.

==Historical context==
The American Civil War (1861–1865) was the fifth war in history to be photographed, the first four being the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), the Crimean War (1853–1856), Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Italian War of Independence (1859).

==Northern photographers==
===Mathew Brady===
Mathew B. Brady (May 18, 1822(?) – January 15, 1896), the son of Irish immigrants, was born in Warren County, New York. Brady would spend his fortune to accumulate photos of the war. In the early 1840s, Brady was a manufacturer of &quot;jewel cases&quot; for daguerreotypes in New York City. By 1844 he had opened his own daguerreian gallery at 205 Broadway, the &quot;New-York Daguerreian Miniature Gallery&quot;, having with Edward Anthony in 1840 received instruction from Prof. Samuel B. Morse for a fee of $50. Still in his 20s, Brady&#x27;s next goal was to establish at his hall of fame, a &quot;Gallery of Illustrious Americans&quot;. &quot;From the first, I regarded myself as under obligation to my country to preserve the faces of its historic men and mothers.&quot; Brady returned to New York in May 1852 after a long absence in Europe. While there he sought treatments for an undisclosed illness (mercury poisoning?). In 1856, seeing the tremendous potential for reproducible, enlarged prints and their purpose for the illustrated newspapers, Brady hired photographer and businessman, Alexander Gardner for his Washington City studio.

Mathew Brady&#x27;s unequaled fame derived from his shrewd ability at self-promotion and a strong determination to succeed as the foremost portrait photographer of his day. He would also become known as the most prominent photographer of the American Civil War. From the very beginning Brady determined to accumulate as many war views as possible, with the understanding that in the not too distant future a photomechanical means of reproduction would be possible. With this end in mind, Brady made, exchanged, borrowed and copied prints and negatives. If there were duplicate views to be had, he bought those. In light of Brady&#x27;s practice, it is not surprising therefore, that a very large number of war views in his vast collection, that were not actually his, came to be associated almost exclusively with his name. Nearly every photograph associated with the struggle seemed to be a &quot;photograph by Brady.&quot;

At the beginning of the war, Mathew Brady secured the necessary permissions, purchased rugged cameras and traveling &quot;darkrooms&quot;, and sent his employees out to begin documenting the struggle, all at his own personal expense. The First Battle of Bull Run provided the initial opportunity to photograph an engagement between opposing armies, however Brady returned with no known photographs from the battlefield. Following the Federal rout, he arrived back in Washington, D.C., the day after the battle and was photographed at his studio wearing a soiled duster and sword (see photo). Tantalizingly little is known about Brady&#x27;s life, as he kept no journals, wrote no memoirs and left but few written accounts.

By war&#x27;s end, Brady estimated he had spent $100,000 to amass more than 10,000 negatives that the public no longer showed an interest in. In 1875, the War Department came to Brady&#x27;s relief and purchased for $25,000 the remainder of Brady&#x27;s collection. Anthony Company possessed another immense collection of Brady cartes-de-visite and war negatives, received by them as compensation for Brady&#x27;s continued indebtedness. From the War Department, the collection devolved to the U.S. Signal Corps, and in 1940 it was accessioned by the National Archives. On January 15, 1896, Brady died penniless in the charity ward of Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. However, in his last days, Brady did not die in isolation. He was visited and comforted often, by friends and admirers up until the very end. His funeral was largely financed by the friends of his adopted regiment, the 7th NYSM.

While it is true that in the beginning, at his own expense, the enterprising Mathew Brady secured the necessary permissions from the War Department for the purpose of documenting the &quot;rebellion&quot;, it would largely be others, particularly those photographers who were under the direct supervision of Alexander Gardner, who would follow the armies and ultimately fulfill the difficult task of recording for posterity a timely, consecutive photographic history of the American Civil War.

===Alexander Gardner===

Alexander Gardner (1821–1882) was born in Paisley, Scotland. He became an apprentice silversmith jeweller at the age of fourteen. Soon, Gardner found out that his interests and talents lay in finance and journalism. When he was twenty-one he left the jeweler&#x27;s shop for a job on the Glasgow Sentinel as a reporter. After only a year of reporting he was appointed editor of the Sentinel. A love of chemistry soon led him to experiment with photography. Deeply disturbed by the exploitation of the working class, and in the spirit of the early cooperative movements in Scotland, Gardner organized a utopian venture in the US called the &quot;Clydesdale Joint Stock Agricultural and Commercial Company&quot; in Iowa, however by 1853 many at the Iowa colony were sick and dying of tuberculosis (then called &quot;consumption&quot;) and the Clydesdale company was dissolved. In 1856, Alex, his brother James and seven others, including Alex&#x27;s wife, Margaret (1824–?), his son Lawrence (1848–?), his daughter Eliza (1850–?) and his mother Jane, immigrated to the United States. Colleague James Gibson may have been one of the party. Alex sought out the renown Mathew Brady for employment, who hired him to manage the Washington City studio. Gardner&#x27;s business acumen and expertise at wet-plate photography and particularly the &quot;Imperial Print&quot;, a enlargement, brought Brady enormous success. With some reluctance, Brady agreed to let Gardner negotiate with Anthony Co. publishing of the increasingly popular &quot;carte-de-visite&quot;, or visiting card.

In the fall of 1861, Gardner took a position as official photographer on the staff of General George B. McClellan, the commander of the Army of the Potomac, and was given the honorary rank of captain. This particular assignment lasted until McClellan&#x27;s demotion in November 1862; however, the title &quot;Photographer to the Army of the Potomac&quot; was used by him to the end of the war.
In the year 1862, Gardner and his operators photographed the 1st Bull Run battlefield, McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign, and the battlefields of Cedar Mountain and Antietam. Since the battlefields of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville were Union defeats and remained in enemy hands, Northern photographers were unable to reach the fields.

By May 1863, Gardner had opened his own studio in Washington City with his brother James, taking with him many of Mathew Brady&#x27;s former staff. Circumstantial evidence suggests that Gardner&#x27;s split with Brady was not caused by any altruistic concerns over the proper citation in published works. Gardner himself in 1867 acknowledged in a deposition that though a photograph be identified on the mount as a &quot;Photograph by A. Gardner&quot; for example, it simply meant that it was printed or copied in his gallery, and he was not necessarily the photographer. The split seems more likely to have grown out of Brady&#x27;s incompetent business practices and his failure to regularly meet his payroll.

In July 1863, Gardner and employees James Gibson and Timothy O&#x27;Sullivan photographed the fresh battlefield of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Grant&#x27;s &quot;Overland Campaign&quot; and Petersburg operations were mostly photographed by Gardner&#x27;s employee Timothy O&#x27;Sullivan, &quot;supervisor of my map and field work.&quot; By June 1864, the designation of official photographer for Grant&#x27;s headquarters command had devolved to Mathew Brady.

In April 1865, Gardner photographed Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt, David Herold, Michael O&#x27;Laughlen, Edman Spangler and Samuel Arnold, who were arrested for conspiring to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln. Gardner, with the assistance of O&#x27;Sullivan, also took photographs of the execution of Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, George Atzerodt and David Herold as they were hanged at Washington Penitentiary on July 7, 1865. Four months later, Gardner photographed the execution of Henry Wirz, commanding officer at the infamous prisoner of war camp in Andersonville, Georgia.

In 1865 and 1866, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s favorite photographer&quot; published his two-volume anthology, &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Photographic Sketch Book of the War&quot;. The two editions consisted of two leather-bound volumes each. Both volumes contained 50 tipped-in, imperial size albumen prints each, with accompanying pages of descriptive, letterpress. At $150 per set however, it was not the success Gardner had hoped. When asked about his work he said, &quot;It is designed to speak for itself . . As mementos of the fearful struggle through which the country has just passed, it is confidently hoped that it will possess an enduring interest.&quot;

In September 1867 Gardner closed his gallery, and with his son Lawrence and assistant William R. Pywell set out to photograph along the proposed route of the U.P.R.R., taking photographs along the 35th parallel, from Wyandotte to Hays Kansas. After finishing his assignment on October 19, Gardner returned to Washington City and that year published his folio sized anthology, &quot;Across the Continent on the Union Pacific Railway, Eastern Division.&quot;

In 1875, the civic-minded Gardner worked at the Washington City Metropolitan Police Department, copying nearly a thousand daguerreotypes to be used as &quot;mug shots&quot;, the forerunner of the &quot;Rogues Gallery.&quot;
In 1879, Alexander Gardner formally retired from photography, devoting his remaining years to improving and enlarging the scope of the co-operative life insurance business model of the &quot;Washington Beneficial Endowment Association.&quot; Gardner continued with his involvement in the &quot;Masonic Mutual Relief Association&quot;, becoming its president in 1882, and the St Andrews Society, a Scottish relief organization.

===George N. Barnard===

George Norman Barnard (1819–1902) was born in Coventry, Connecticut, and as a child moved to upstate New York. After a brief career in hotel management, he opened a daguerreotype studio in Oswego, New York, becoming nationally known for his portraits. It is not known where Barnard learned his trade. On July 5, 1853, Barnard photographed the conflagration at the Ames flour mills in Oswego, producing what may be the first American &quot;news&quot; photograph. In 1854 he moved his operation to Syracuse, New York, and began using the wet-plate collodion process. In 1859, Barnard joined Edward Anthony&#x27;s firm. At the outbreak of war, Barnard was working for Mathew Brady in Washington, D.C., and New York City. Barnard, besides doing portraits and photographing the troops around Washington, D.C., was among Brady&#x27;s initial corps of photographers, who were sent into the field to photograph the battlefields of Northern Virginia, and the Peninsula, including Bull Run and Yorktown, as well as Harper&#x27;s Ferry. Barnard is best known for his 1866 masterpiece, &quot;Photographic Views of Sherman&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, which contains 61 Imperial size, albumen prints embracing scenes from the occupation of Nashville, the great battles around Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain, the campaign of Atlanta, the Great March to the Sea, and the Great Raid through the Carolinas. He continued to photograph after the war, operating studios in Charleston, S.C. and Chicago. His Chicago studio was destroyed by the historic fire of 1871. In 1880 Barnard sold his Charleston studio and moved to Rochester, New York. From 1881 to 1883 he was the distinguished spokesman for George Eastman&#x27;s line gelatine dry plates. Barnard ventured into his own short lived dry plate manufacturing concern with Robert H. Furman in 1882–83. In 1884, the Barnards moved to Painesville, Ohio and opened a studio with partner, local artist Horace Tibbals, which utilized their own manufactured dry plates. In 1888, George closed his business and his family moved to Gadsden, Alabama. In 1892, he moved for the last time to Cedarville, near Syracuse, New York, where he maintained his interest in photography, taking pictures of friends and family, and taking yearly class pictures of the school children. George Barnard died on February 4, 1902, at the home of his daughter, in Onondaga. He was 82. He is buried in Gilbert Cemetery in Marcellus, New York.

===Timothy H. O&#x27;Sullivan===

Timothy H. O&#x27;Sullivan (1840–1882) was born in New York City. As a teenager, he was employed by Mathew Brady and worked for him continuously from 1856 to late 1862, when he was hired by Alexander Gardner as &quot;superintendent of my map and field work.&quot; In the winter of 1861–62, O&#x27;Sullivan was dispatched to document Gen. Thomas W. Sherman&#x27;s Port Royal, S.C. operations. In July 1862, O&#x27;Sullivan followed the campaign of Gen. John Pope in Virginia. In July 1863, he reached the pinnacle of his career when he took pictures at Gettysburg, PA., most notably, &quot;The Harvest of Death&quot;. In 1864, following Gen. Grant&#x27;s trail, he photographed during the Siege of Petersburg and the siege of Fort Fisher. That brought him to Appomattox Court House in April 1865, and back to Petersburg in May. Fully 45 of the 100 prints in &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Photographic Sketch Book Of The War&quot; are credited to O&#x27;Sullivan.

At the end of the Civil War, O&#x27;Sullivan was made official government photographer for the Clarence King (1867, 68, 69, 72), Isthmus of Darien (Panama 1870) and George Wheeler (1871, 73, 74) Expeditions respectively, during which time he married fellow photographer, William Pywell&#x27;s sister Laura in 1873. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s pictures were among the first to record the prehistoric ruins, Navajo weavers, and Pueblo villages of the southwest, and were instrumental in attracting settlers to the West. In 1875 O&#x27;Sullivan returned to Washington, D.C., where he spent the last years of his short life as the official photographer of the Treasury Department. Just seven years later, at the young age of 42, O&#x27;Sullivan died of tuberculosis at his parents’ home in Staten Island, New York.

===James F. Gibson===

James F. Gibson (1828/29–?), perhaps the least recognized of the war&#x27;s most significant photographers was also one of the least known. In 1860, Scotsman Gibson&#x27;s name appeared with that of his wife Elizabeth in the Washington, D.C., census, and the city directory showed that Mathew Brady employed him. Gibson may have emigrated to America with Alexander Gardner, who was also from Scotland. Gibson&#x27;s first documented trip into the field was when he accompanied George N. Barnard to the Bull Run battlefield in March 1862. He worked with Gardner at Gettysburg and partnered with him at Sharpsburg, but Gibson&#x27;s own greatest legacy was the wide array of photographs he took while on the Virginia peninsula, in particular his poignant, landmark photo of the wounded at Savage Station, Virginia. Several years after the war, before a court could rule on Gibson&#x27;s 1868 civil suit against business partner, Mathew Brady (Gibson also sued Gardner), he heavily mortgaged Brady&#x27;s failing Washington Gallery, which he partly owned (50%) and managed from Sept. 1864, left for Kansas with the cash, and was never heard from again.

===Andrew J. Russell===

Andrew J. Russell (1829–1902), was born in Walpole, New Hampshire, the son of Harriet (née Robinson) and Joseph Russell. He was raised in Nunda, New York. He took an early interest in painting, and in addition to executing portraiture for local public figures, he was drawn to railroads and trains. During the first two years of the Civil War, Russell painted a diorama used to recruit soldiers for the Union Army. On 22 August 1862, he volunteered at Elmira, New York, mustering in the following month as a captain in Company F, 141st New York Volunteer Regiment. In February 1863, Russell, who had become interested in the new art of photography, paid free-lance photographer Egbert Guy Fowx $300 to teach him the wet-plate collodion process.
Capt. Russell&#x27;s first photographs were used by Brigadier General Herman Haupt to illustrate his reports. Impressed with his work, on 1 March 1863, Haupt arranged to have Russell detached from his regiment and assigned to the United States Military Railroad Construction Corps, making Russell one of only two, Federal non-civilian Civil War photographers (Pvt. Philip Haas). In his embedded capacity, Russell not only photographed transportation subjects for the War Department, but also likely moonlighted by selling battlefield negatives to the Anthonys. In fact, Russell took over a thousand photos in two and a half years, some of which were distributed exclusively to President Lincoln. He&#x27;s probably best known for &quot;Stone wall at foot of Marye&#x27;s Heights, Fredericksburg, Va.&quot; showing dead Confederates of Barksdale&#x27;s brigade, during the battle of Chancellorsville. Andrew Russell died on September 22, 1902, in Brooklyn, New York. He is buried in Cypress Hills Cemetery.

===Thomas C. Roche===

Thomas C. Roche (1826–1895) In 1858, Roche became interested in photography and was listed as an agent at 83 South St. in Brooklyn, New York. In 1862 he went to work for Anthony Co., taking the first complete set of Central Park stereoviews published by them. Many, early Anthony stereoviews by Roche were published on fragile glass which, not surprisingly, are today extremely rare. Over the years, Roche was Anthony Co.&#x27;s principal photographer and senior advisor and one of their most valuable assets, developing many patents for the company&#x27;s products and processes. Arguably, Roche&#x27;s most important patent (241,070) was taken out in 1881 for a silver bromide-sensitized gelatin, &quot;dry plate.&quot; Roche&#x27;s process would signal the end of &quot;wet plate&quot; photography. Roche lived well off his many royalties, and continued as technical advisor to the company, sharing his knowledge, wisdom and anecdotes with readers of Anthony&#x27;s Bulletin up until his death in 1895. Roche is probably best known for, and counts among his many accomplishments, the roughly 50 stereoviews taken on April 3, 1865, following the fall of Petersburg, Virginia. These include the &quot;death studies&quot;, at least 20 stereoviews of the dead, allegedly taken inside Fort Mahone The War Department contracts guaranteed the Anthonys the stereo negatives, while furnishing the government with the large format plates.

===Jacob F. Coonley===

Jacob Frank &quot;Jay&quot; Coonley (1832–1915) New York Ambrotypist, Coonley was originally a landscape painter who early on learned the trade from George N. Barnard. He managed Edward Anthony&#x27;s stereoscopic print shop until 1862, taking assignments in Pennsylvania, New York and Washington, D.C. When war erupted, Coonley remained in Washington, photographing generals soldiers, statesman and the like. In 1862 he briefly moved to Philadelphia to open the portrait gallery partnership of &quot;Coonley &amp; Wolfsberger&quot;. Six month later, Coonley was back in New York managing &quot;Clarke&#x27;s Union Gallery&quot;, corner of Broadway and Bleecker St. In 1864, he was awarded a contract by Quartermaster General Montgomery Meigs, for photographic work along the lines of the railroads in US. possession, in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. During this time, Coonley also produced the Nashville series for Edward Anthony. Coonley was also very likely responsible for at least fourteen photos archived at the Library of Congress, depicting the April 14, 1865, Fort Sumter Flag-Raising Ceremony, though he&#x27;s cited as the author of just one. The photographic evidence suggests the Anthony Co. photographer used a stereo camera with a drop-shutter, utilizing two camera locations inside the fort. The only view inside Fort Sumter that actually depicts the garrison flag being raised is the work of photographer William E. James. From 1865 to 1871 Coonley managed C.J. Quinby&#x27;s Charleston, S.C. gallery, with George N. Barnard joining as a partner in 1868. Coonley is known to have operated a business at 78 Broughton Street, Savannah, Georgia, dealing in Chromos, engravings and paintings, as well as manufacturing frames and publishing of stereoviews and photographs. Some years later, Cooley spent time in Nassau, Bahamas, at the request of Governor-General, Sir William Robinson. He returned to New York in 1881 and took a position as operator for J.M. Mora. In 1886 Coonley returned to Nassau, establishing a successful business there until 1904, when he sold out and returned to New York. Seventy-two year old Coonley would continue to spend his winters in the Bahamas. A December 1915 article on his death published in the New York &quot;Evening World&quot; stated that Coonley, who had been an invalid for some time, died after attempting suicide.

===Sam A. Cooley===

Samuel Abbot Cooley (1821–1900), from Connecticut, surfaced in the Beaufort area before the war as a photographer. He stayed in the occupied area as a sutler and photographer for X Corps, employing his large format, drop-shutter and twin lens stereo cameras. By 1863 Cooley had a photographic studio above his store located next door to the Arsenal. He sold his photographic business in May 1864 with the intent of returning to the North. He reappeared in Beaufort in 1865, where he opened a mercantile and simultaneously advertised himself as &quot;Photographer, Department of the South&quot;, doing contract work for the government. Cooley advertised in the local paper an inventory of over two thousand different negatives, views taken from Charleston, S.C, to St. Augustine Fla., which included card, stereoscopic and large 11X14 views taken for the government. Cooley also opened galleries in Hilton Head, S.C. and Jacksonville, Florida. In 1866 he had also established himself as an auctioneer and a town marshal, with his office at the Beaufort Hotel in Beaufort. His account book indicates he sold bread and foodstuffs to various businesses as well as to the General Hospital and the Small Pox Hospital. He eventually returned home to Hartford, Connecticut in 1869, where he offered at his gallery, an &quot;exhibition of beautiful Stereopticon Views.&quot; Sam passed on 15 May 1900 (age 78) and is buried at Old North Cemetery, Hartford, Connecticut.

===John Reekie===

John Reekie (1829–1885) was another little known Civil War photographer. A Scotsman, Reekie was employed by Alexander Gardner. Reekie was active in Virginia, taking views at Dutch Gap and City Point, and in and around Petersburg, Mechanicsville and Richmond. Reekie&#x27;s probably best known for his scenes of the unburied dead, on the battlefields of Gaines&#x27; Mill and Cold Harbor. One of his most well-known, &quot;A Burial Party, Cold Harbor,&quot; was included with six others of his negatives in &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Photographic Sketch Book of the War.&quot; It depicts African American soldiers gathering human remains on the Cold Harbor battlefield, almost a year after the battle. This photograph is notable for being one of relatively few images depicting black soldiers at work in the war.
&lt;br&gt;
John Reekie was an officer of the Saint Andrews Society, a Scottish relief organization in Washington, D.C., as was Alexander and James Gardner and David Knox. Reekie died on April 6, 1885, of pneumonia and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery (Washington, D.C.).

===David B. Woodbury===

David B. Woodbury (1839–1879) was arguably the best of the artists who stayed with Brady through the war. In March 1862, Mathew Brady sent Woodbury and Edward Whitney out to photograph the 1st Bull Run battlefield, and in May, views of the Peninsula Campaign. In July 1863, Woodbury and Anthony Berger photographed the Gettysburg battlefield for Brady, returning on November 19 to take &quot;pictures of the crowd and Procession&quot; (Nov. 23, 1863 letter to sister Eliza). In the summer of 1864, Woodbury photographed Grant&#x27;s Headquarters Command for Brady, who had replaced Alexander Gardner as official photographer. On April 24, Woodbury assisted J.F. Coonley on the steps the Treasury Building, for the purpose of photographing the &quot;Grand Review of the Army&quot;, &quot;the plates being exposed with a drop shutter, this being the nearest thing to an instantaneous exposure with a wet plate.&quot; David B. Woodbury died December 30, 1866, in Gibraltar, where he had traveled, seeking a milder climate for his declining health caused by consumption.

===David Knox===

David Knox (1821–1895) was born in Renfrew, Scotland. In 1849, with wife Jane older brother John and John&#x27;s wife Elizabeth, machinist Knox emigrated to America, taking a machinist job in New Haven, Connecticut. Knox became a naturalized citizen on March 22, 1855, just five years after the tragic deaths of 28 year-old Jane and his 7-week-old son David. In 1856, David moved to Springfield, Ill., taking a job as a machinist for the Great Western Railroad. His home was just one block from the residence of Abraham Lincoln. Soon after, Knox relocated his family to Washington, D.C. The first reference to Knox working at the Mathew B. Brady studio is a September 21, 1862, telegram sent from the Antietam battlefield by Alexander Gardner, addressed to &quot;David Knox Brady Gallery&quot;, Washington. Knox was likely trained there by Gardner in the use of a large format camera. Historians don&#x27;t know exactly when Knox left Brady&#x27;s employ to Join Alexander Gardner&#x27;s new competing firm. Returns for the June–July 1863 Draft Registration show Knox as a 42-year-old photographer, very near Gardner&#x27;s gallery. Four of Knox&#x27;s wartime negatives were included in &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Photographic Sketch Book of the War.&quot;[49] He is probably best known for his iconic plate, &quot;13 inch mortar Dictator, in front of Petersburg, Va.&quot; Like his colleagues John Reekie and the Gardner brothers, Knox was an officer of the Washington, D.C., Saint Andrews Society, a Scottish relief organization.[50] On May 7–10, 1868 the Crow, Northern Cheyenne and Northern Arapaho, signed treaties at Fort Laramie, Dakota Territory which were attested to by &quot;Alex. Gardner&quot; and &quot;David Knox&quot; establishing that Knox was engaged there in picture taking with Gardner. In 1870 David Knox and his wife Marion moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he had apparently finished with photography to pursue regular employment as a machinist. He became head of the Union Pacific Railroad machinist shops. David died on November 24, 1895, and is buried with Marion at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Omaha, Nebraska.

===William R. Pywell===

William Redish Pywell (1843–1887) worked for both Mathew Brady and Alexander Gardner. Pywell&#x27;s photographs are an important and integral part of the historic photographic record of the American Civil War. Three fine negatives are credited to Pywell in &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Photographic Sketch Book of the War&quot;. Pywell was busy in both the Western Theatre as well as in the East, but is probably best remembered for his early photographs of the slave pens of Alexandria, Va.
Between September and October 1867, Pywell assisted Alexander Gardner during the &quot;Kansas Pacific Railway Survey&quot; across the 39th parallel, from Wyandotte, Kansas to Fort Wallace in western Kansas. The result would be Gardner&#x27;s folio sized album &quot;Across the Continent on the Union Pacific Railway, Eastern Division&quot;. Six years later, he was the official photographer of the 1873 Yellowstone Expedition to survey a route for the Northern Pacific Railroad along the Yellowstone River, under the overall command of Colonel David S. Stanley, with Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer as second in command.
===William F. Browne===

William Frank Browne (?–1867) was born in Northfield, Vermont. At the outset of war, Browne enlisted in Company C of the 15th Vermont Infantry at Berlin, Vermont. After the end of his two-year enlistment, Brown began working as a freelance camp photographer for the 5th Michigan Cavalry, part of George A. Custer&#x27;s Michigan brigade. Browne wintered with them in their encampment at Stevensburg, Virginia while taking some of the earliest photographs of Brigadier General Custer. In 1864–65 Browne began doing contract work for Alexander Gardner. In May 1865, Maj. General Henry H. Abbot assigned Browne to photograph the James River water batteries around Richmond, Va., thus &quot;preserving an invaluable record of their wonderful completeness.&quot; After the war, Gardner published 120 of Browne&#x27;s negatives as &quot;View of Confederate Water Batteries on the James River.&quot; Browne returned to his native Northfield, Vermont, where he died of consumption (tuberculosis) in 1867.

===Isaac G. and Charles J. Tyson===

Isaac Griffith (1833–1913) and Charles John (1838–1906) Tyson. were residents of Gettysburg, Pa. in July 1863; however, the Tysons&#x27; &quot;Tyson&#x27;s Excelsior Photographic Gallery&quot; wasn&#x27;t as yet properly equipped to take photographs in the field, for which there was basically no demand at the time. The Tysons evacuated town, as did most of the residents, prior to the Rebel shelling and occupation on July 1. Working in the wake of the July visits to the battlefield by Alexander Gardner and Mathew B. Brady, the Tyson brothers, now fully equipped to take views in the field, by December were offering their &quot;Photographic Views of the Battle-Field of Gettysburg.&quot; Then, on November 19, the brothers recorded a number of historic views of the procession to the dedication of the Soldier&#x27;s National Cemetery, one of which captured President Lincoln on horseback. William H. Tipton, an apprentice of the Tysons, took over the Tyson gallery in 1868.

===George Stacy===

George Stacy (1831–1897) George Stacy was a Civil War, field photographer and later a prolific publisher of stereoviews, not necessisarily his own. The first reference to George Stacy being a photographer may be in New Brunswick Canada. A photographer by that name placed and advertisement in a Federicton, New Brunswick newspaper dated July 7, 1857. The advertisement stated: &quot;SOMETHING NEW just received in Stacy&#x27;s Ambrotype room&quot; and advertised stereoscopes and other photographic needs. George Stacy had a storefront at 691 Broadway in New York City, from 1861 to 1865. His earliest confirmed stereoviews are a series he took of the Prince of Whales&#x27; visit to Portland, ME. on Oct. 20, 1860. In June 1861 Stacy recorded his renown Fortress Monroe series, where his future brother in law Colin Van Gelder Forbes was serving with Duryee&#x27;s Zouaves (5th NYVI) at the time. An industry census shows that Stacy was still marketing stereoviews in 1870. However, he&#x27;s also listed as a farmer in that and the 1880 census, while living in Paterson N.J. It&#x27;s likely that photography was his winter activity, whereas farming was taken up during the warmer months.

===Frederick Gutekunst===

Frederick Gutekunst (1831–1917) Pennsylvania photographer, Gutekunst opened two studios in Philadelphia in 1856. On July 9, just six days after the &quot;Battle of Gettysburg&quot;, Gutekunst produced a series seven large plates of exquisite quality, including the first image of local hero John L. Burns. An elegant portrait of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant stirred national interest and further set the &quot;Dean of American Photographers&quot; apart from his contemporaries. By 1893 he had been in business almost forty years and was residing in the upscale suburb of Germantown. Gutekunst suffered from Bright&#x27;s Disease, which may have precipitated a fall down some stairs eight weeks before his death.

===E. T. Whitney===
Edward Tompkins Whitney (1820–1893) In 1844, Whitney, born in New York City, quit the jewelry business to learn the daguerreotype process from Matrin M. Lawrence, before moving to Rochester New York in 1846, as an operator in the studio of Thomas Mercer. In 1850, J. W. Black of Boston instructed Whitney in the &quot;new art&quot; of wet-plate collodion photography. Whitney opened his own &quot;Skylight Gallery&quot; in Rochester in 1851, and made regular trips to the New York
City studios of Matthew Brady and Jeremiah Gurney in order to
study the latest improvements in photography. In 1959, after recovering from the ill effects of cyanide poisoning, Whitney sold his Rochester business and moved to New York City, opening a gallery at 585 Broadway with Andrew W. Paradise, Mathew Brady&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man.&quot; Nevertheless, during the winter of 1861–62, Brady would commission Whitney to take &quot;views of the fortifications around Washington and places of interest for the Government.&quot; These would include scenes in and around Arlington, Falls Church and Alexandria, VA. In March 1862, Brady again dispatched Whitney and Brady operator, David Woodbury, to take photographs on the Bull Run battlefield. Whitney also relates that he took views at Yorktown, Williamsburg, White House, Gaines&#x27; Mill, and Westover and Berkeley Landings during McClellan&#x27;s &quot;Peninsula Campaign&quot;. Whitney personally appears in an unusually large number of photographs from 1861 to 1863, and while there is no question that Whitney took photographs for Brady, alas, there are no wartime views specifically ascribed to him. Whitney&#x27;s last documented self-portrait (Anthony, &quot;Views in Washington City&quot;, 2733) is on March 27, 1863, during which time he documented the Southern Plains Indian Delegation inside the White House&#x27;s well lit conservatory (2734, 2735). In addition to Anthony&#x27;s post-war views with back label attributions to Whitney &amp; Paradise, Whitney is also listed as working with a Mr. Beckwith in Norwalk, Connecticut. from 1865 to 1871, and then alone in Norwalk from 1873 to 1880. Lastly he can be placed in Wilton, Connecticut from 1879 to 1886.

===Jeremiah Gurney===

Jeremiah Gurney (1812–1895) was born in Coeymans, New York. Gurney, then a jeweler in Saratoga, N.Y. became one of the first, if not the first &quot;student&quot; in America to learn the &quot;new art&quot; of daguerreian photography. Gurney was taught the process by Samuel F.B. Morse in 1839, who explained to Gurney that &quot;What you will have to allow for is the initial outlay . . And there is of course my fee.&quot; The fee was thought to have been fifty dollars. Gurney was not listed in the New York city directories until 1843, when he appears as a daguerreian at 189 Broadway. In the 1850s &quot;Gurney&#x27;s Daguerreian Gallery&quot; offered mammoth daguerreotype prints from double full size plates. In 1852, he took time off to recover from a common illness of the daguerreian trade, mercury vapor poisoning. In 1857 Gurney was listed in the New York City Directory at 359 Broadway, in partnership with C.D Fredericks. In 1860, he was listed as a &quot;photographist&quot; at 707 Broadway, in business as &quot;J. Gurney and Son.&quot; Gurney and son Benjamin advanced paper photography with the use of the &quot;Chrystalotype&quot; process. Jeremiah Gurney is probably best known for his having taken a photograph of Abraham Lincoln in an open coffin April 24, 1865, as the President&#x27;s body lay in state in City Hall, New York City. The episode caused much distress to Mary Lincoln, who had forbid the taking of any photographs of her husband&#x27;s corpse. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was furious and succeeded in confiscating all of the existing prints and negatives but one (That print, secreted away by Lincoln secretary John Hay was rediscovered in 1952 at the Illinois State Historical Library by 14-year-old Ronald Rietveld). In 1874 Gurney&#x27;s partnership with his son was dissolved. In his memoirs, Gurney stated that in 1895, at 83 years old, &quot;I am currently semi-retired from the photographic arts industry, living here in Coxsackie [New York] with my daughter Martha. Jeremiah Gurney died that same year.

===G. O. Brown===

George Oscar Brown (?–?) Active 1860–1889. Information on Brown is scant. In April 1866, under the direction of Dr. Reed Bonteceau, Brown, at the time just a hospital steward at the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., was hired as an assistant cameraman by the museum&#x27;s photographer, William Bell. The assignment was primarily to document medical specimens (bones, skulls &amp;c.) on the &quot;Wilderness&quot; and &quot;Spotsylvania&quot; battlefields of Virginia. Their guide on that occasion was none other than Lt. George E. Chancellor, Co. E, 9th Va. Cav., after whose family the battlefield is named. Though new to the field of photography, Brown did respectable work, producing a number of stereo photographs that have aided in our comprehension of those terrible battles. In the 1868 census, Brown was listed as a photographer at the Medical Museum. By 1870, Brown was promoting and instructing others in the use of the &quot;Porcelain Print&quot; process, which was patented by photographer Egebert Guy Fowx. In 1872 Brown was elected Secretary of &quot;The Maryland Photographic Association.&quot; Brown&#x27;s trail is lost after 1873.

===Haas and Peale===

Philip Haas (1808–1871) and Washington Peale (1825–1868) While but little is known of Haas&#x27; early personal history, almost nothing is known about Peale. In 1839–40, Haas, a lithographer based in Washington, D.C., endeavored to learn the new art of the &quot;daguerreotype.&quot; By 1852, forty-four year old Haas was an accomplished wet-plate photographer, with a studio in New York City &quot;near the corner of White Street.&quot; On September 23, 1861, fifty-three year old Haas enlisted with the 1st N.Y. Engineers, claiming he was forty-three. Haas was mustered on January 17, 1862, as a 2nd Lt. in Company A. Special Order No. 248, dated July 15, 1862, Hilton Head, Port Royal, detailed Haas for &quot;special service at headquarters.&quot; In 1863, Haas and newly acquired assistant Washington Peale were taking photographs of General Quincy Gilmore&#x27;s siege operations on Morris Island. The pair are credited with dozens of views of the activities of the Union Army in South Carolina during the Civil War, including Folly Island, Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbor, Lighthouse Inlet and Morris Island. Haas resigned his commission due to ill health on May 25, 1863, but continued taking photographs for the War Department. After 1863, the trail of his life grows thin. Of particular historic significance is the pair&#x27;s &quot;Unidentified camp&quot;, recognized in the year 2000 by South Carolina, author Jack Thompson to be among the world&#x27;s very first photographs of actual combat. It depicts monitor-class ironclads and U.S.S. New Ironsides in action off Morris Island, South Carolina. A September 8, 1863, date has been suggested for the photo, however during that action the 17-gun frigate was engaging Fort Moultrie at close range and out of view of the Federal camps which were away. In fact, it was Southern photographer George S. Cook, who was taking combat action photographs from the parapet of Fort Sumter on September 8, while he himself was being shelled by monitor &quot;Weehawken&quot;, grounded off Cummings Point. A more plausible opportunity for Haas and Peale to have captured U.S.S. New Ironsides in action would have been the extended period from September 5–6, when for 36 straight hours the ironclads engaged batteries Wagner and Gregg (top photo), prior to the Rebel evacuations on September 7.

===John Carbutt===

John Carbutt (1832–1905) was born in Sheffield, England. His first stop in the New World was Canada. The Chicago, Illinois city directory of 1861 is the first to bear his name in the United States. During the 1860s in Chicago, Carbutt was a prolific producer of stereoviews of Chicago, the Upper Mississippi, and the &quot;Great West.&quot; Western images included the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad and portraits of Indians. Carbutt may be best recognized for his significant contributions to the advancement of photographic processes in the 19th century and early 20th century. He was among the earliest photographers to experiment with magnesium light (January 1865), he experimented with dry plates as early as 1864 and began producing commercial dry plates in 1879. Carbutt and Dr. Arthur W. Goodspeed produced the earliest X-ray photographs in February 1896. Thus it is no wonder that his biographer William Brey barely mentions his Civil War photographs. The largest known output of Civil War photographs by Carbutt are 40 or so stereoviews of the 134th Illinois Infantry camped at Columbus, Kentucky. The 134th was a 100-day unit that were in Columbus from June 1864 until October 1864. Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train was photographed by Carbutt as it passed through Chicago on May 1, 1865, and he followed the train to Springfield where he obtained photographs of Lincoln&#x27;s home. The last of the great Sanitary Fairs was held in Chicago in June 1865 and Carbutt was there to photograph the interior and exterior of the second &quot;Northwestern Soldiers Fair&quot;. The Illinois soldiers&#x27; homes at Chicago and Cairo, Illinois required continued funding, and the fair helped cover other continuing expenses of the Northwestern Sanitary Commission.

===Bierstadt Brothers===

The Bierstadt Brothers consisted of Edward (1824–1906), Charles (1828–1903) and Albert Bierstadt (1830–1902) who immigrated with their parents to New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1831 from Solingen, Germany. The Bierstadt brothers opened a photographic gallery in New Bedford which they operated from 1859 to about 1867. Albert seems to have been the driving force behind the brothers&#x27; Civil War images. He and his friend Emanuel Leutze obtained passes in October 1861 from Gen. Winfield Scott to travel, photograph and sketch along the Potomac River outside of Washington, D.C. They took 19 stereoview photographs of war-time Washington, D.C., and its nearby defenses. The photographs of defenses showed Union pickets near Lewinsville, Virginia and scenes at Camp Griffin, which was near Lewinsville. Troops photographed include the 43rd Regiment New York Volunteers and the 49th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers. These images were published by the Bierstadt Brothers in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Edward ran a temporary studio in Langley near the 43rd New York&#x27;s quarters at Camp Griffin. There he joined other photographers, including George Houghton, who took some iconic photographs of the Vermont Brigade in Northern Virginia. Washington, D.C., was not the brothers&#x27; only foray into Civil War photography. They published 8 views of the Metropolitan (Sanitary) Fair that took place in New York City in April 1864. Albert Bierstadt had an exhibit at the fair featuring Native American culture. After the partnership broke up around 1867 Albert pursued his career as an artist and became a member of the Hudson River school of artists. He is best known for his dramatic paintings of the Western United States. Edward and Charles continued independent careers as photographers.

===Henry P. Moore===

Henry P. Moore (1835–1911) was born in Goffstown, New Hampshire. His family moved to Concord, New Hampshire when Henry was seven. By 1862 Moore was a &quot;well known&quot; photographer in Concord, New Hampshire. His entrance into Civil War photography occurred when Moore followed the Third New Hampshire Regiment soldiers to Hilton Head, South Carolina in February 1862 and stayed through April or May 1862. His photography studio on the island of Hilton Head, South Carolina, comprised a tent set up in a sandy cotton field. He took at least one more trip to the same area that extended from April 22 to the end of May, 1863. The glass plate negatives he used measured . Photographic prints were sold at his Concord, NH gallery for one dollar each. Moore produced more than 60 photographs of the South. The images include extensive coverage of the Third New Hampshire Regiment, but are not limited to that. He photographed scenes around Hilton Head, the 6th Connecticut, Signal Corps, 1st Massachusetts Cavalry, navy ships and sailors. Military operations were not his only interest. Scenes of plantations and recently freed slaves fill out his portfolio. He photographed cotton processing and slave quarters on Hilton Head, J.E. Seabrook&#x27;s plantation on Edisto Island, and &quot;contrabands&quot; harvesting sweet potatoes at Hopkinson&#x27;s Plantation on Edisto Island. Moore continued as a photographer in Concord, NH after the war. In 1900 he moved to Buffalo, New York closer to his daughter Alice. He died in 1911 in Buffalo, but is buried in his hometown of Concord, NH.

==Southern photographers==
In the first months of the war, southern &quot;artists&quot; actively documented in the field through their images. In fact, a Southerner took the first photographs of the war inside Fort Sumter. However, as a consequence of the war and rampant inflation most were soon out of business. Unfortunately, as war photographs were long regarded with extreme disfavor in the South after the rebellion, most were disposed of. Fortunately, this was not the case for the many cherished family portraits of Confederate servicemen who lived and died during the war. These remarkable photographs are among the last known record of who they were and what they looked like.
===George S. Cook===
The most renowned Southern photographer was George Smith Cook (1819–1902). The native of Stamford, Connecticut, was not successful in the mercantile business, so he moved to New Orleans and became a portrait painter. This proved unprofitable and in 1842 Cook began working with the &quot;new art&quot; of the daguerreotype, settling in Charleston, South Carolina, where he raised a family.
Cook&#x27;s status as one of the South&#x27;s most famous photographers was due in part to his visit to Fort Sumter on Feb. 8, 1861, which resulted in the first mass marketing of cartes-de-visite, a photograph of the fort&#x27;s commander, Maj. Robert Anderson. A successful portrait business that survived the war, and the systematic documentation of Union shelling of Charleston and in particular, Fort Sumter added to Cook&#x27;s fame. Then, on September 8, 1863, he and business partner James Osborn photographed the inside of Fort Sumter, and as luck would have it, also captured the developing naval action in the harbor, Federal ironclads firing on Fort Moultrie.
The historic images depict three ironclad monitors and U.S.S. New Ironsides firing on Fort Moultrie in defense of monitor U.S.S. Weehawken, grounded off Cummings Point. For unknown reasons, the historic stereoview was not marketed until 1880, when it was finally offered for sale by Cook&#x27;s son, George LaGrange Cook.
Sadly, Cook&#x27;s extensive collection, mainly consisting of portraits of notable Southern personalities, was lost on Feb. 17, 1865, when his Columbia, S.C. studio was destroyed during the firestorm that engulfed the capital city.
Cook moved his family to Richmond in 1880, and his older son, George LaGrange Cook, took charge of the studio in Charleston. In Richmond, Cook bought up the businesses of photographers who were retiring, or moving from the city. He thus amassed the most comprehensive collection of prints and negatives of the former Confederate capital known to exist. Cook remained an active photographer for the remainder of his life. In 1891, one year before George&#x27;s death, George Jr. joined his father and younger brother Huestis in Richmond. After George Jr&#x27;s death in 1919, Huestis took over the Richmond studio.

Note: The famous &quot;exploding shell&quot; photo falsely attributed to Cook is in reality a painting by C.S.A. Lt. John R. Key, based on three half stereos taken by Cook inside Fort Sumter on Sept. 8, 1863. Experts had overlooked the fact that no camera of the time was capable of taking the wide angle depicted.

===Osborn &amp; Durbec===

In 1858, James M. Osborn (1811–1868), a 47 year old daguerreian, native of New York, living in Charleston, S.C., joined forces with 22 year old Charleston native, Frederick Eugene Durbec (1836–1894). Both were soon to become among the war&#x27;s first photographers. By 1860, from their state-of-the-art, high-volume studio, they had reached a national audience with their advertised &quot;largest and most varied assortment of stereoscopic instruments and pictures ever offered in this country.&quot; By then, both had joined the Lafayette Artillery, Durbec having risen to the rank of colonel. It was also at this time that O&amp;D produced documentary photographs of the city and its vicinity, including their singularly historic, antebellum scenes of plantations and slave life. Following the Federal surrender of Fort Sumter on April 14, 1861, Osborn would visit the fort and its surrounds on at least two occasions, taking at least 43 stereo images of the battle&#x27;s aftermath, in what is the largest known group of Confederate images of the war, and which is considered the most comprehensive photographic record of a Civil War engagement ever made. Today, thirty-nine are known to exist. Their friendship would outlast their Charleston business however, which the war and damaging fires had brought to an end by February 1862. Then, in September 1863, in response to Gen. Thomas Jordan&#x27;s desire to document what &quot;Southern troops could endure&quot;, Osborn and fellow artist George S. Cook volunteered to photograph the interior of Fort Sumter, which had been shelled by Union batteries into a shapeless mass. Little did the enterprising partners know that one result of this visit would be the first combat photographs in history.
===J.D. Edwards===

Jay Dearborn Edwards (1831–1900), a New Hampshire native, was born Jay Dearborn Moody, on July 14, 1831. After the death of his father in 1842, young Jay was sent to St. Louis to live with an aunt, at which time his surname was changed to Edwards. By age 17, he was a lecturer on the pseudoscience phrenology, and apparently also began his photographic career, operating a daguerreian studio at 92-1/2 Fourth Street. In 1851, he and his aunt moved to New Orleans, and Jay quickly established himself at 19 Royal Street. He preferred working outdoors in his &quot;queer-looking wagon.&quot; The new art of wet-plate photography enabled Edwards to distribute his stereoscopic views images throughout New Orleans. Because his stereo cards had a P.O. box number imprinted on the backs, historians have concluded he did not operate his own gallery in New Orleans. However, that changed when he and E. H. Newton Jr. formed a partnership and opened the Gallery of Photographic Art, located at 19 Royal Street. The gallery specialized in &quot;stereoscopic views of any part of the world,&quot; and was assisted by New York publisher Edward Anthony and the London Stereoscopic Company. Their diverse inventory included an array of photographic equipment, photographs, ambrotypes, melainotypes, portrait enlargements, pastel, oil, and watercolor prints. Edwards undertook one of the earliest wartime photo expeditions by venturing into the field in April 1861. He followed Confederate units from New Orleans to Pensacola, Fl., as they mobilized against Fort Pickens. Edwards advertised 39 views at &quot;$1 per copy.&quot; Two were reproduced as woodcuts in Harper&#x27;s Weekly in June, though Edwards received no credit. Afterwards, Edward was apparently out of business.
===McPherson &amp; Oliver===

William D. McPherson (January 15, 1825 – October 9, 1867) and J. Oliver (?–?) The southern photographers were active in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the 1860s. McPherson &amp; Oliver&#x27;s business was exclusively Confederate, until Union forces occupied Baton Rouge in May 1862. Like other Southern photographers in occupied cities, the pair quickly adapted to the occupation. This arrangement had the benefit of being able to procure photography supplies through special arrangements with the military. McPherson &amp; Oliver are probably best known for &quot;The Scourged Back&quot;, their sensational, widely published portrait of &quot;Gordon&quot;, an escaped slave from a Louisiana plantation, who came into the Union lines at Baton Rouge. The pair went to Port Hudson, La. in the summer of 1863 and photographed the hard-fought siege of that city. After the fall of Port Hudson on July 8, McPherson &amp; Oliver photographed the captured, Confederate fortifications. In August 1864, following the capture of Fort Morgan on Mobile Bay, Alabama, McPherson &amp; Oliver made a comprehensive photographic record of that installation. In 1864 they moved to New Orleans and operated a gallery at 133 Canal Street. On April 26, 1865, &quot;J. Oliver, 132 Canal, photographer&quot; appeared as number 3490 a second district of New Orleans military draft list. In 1865 they dissolved their partnership. McPherson carried on with his own gallery at 132 Canal St. until his death from yellow fever in 1867. Samuel T. Blessing, who survived the epidemic, administered McPherson&#x27;s estate.

===Charles Richard Rees===

Charles Richard Rees (January 26, 1825 – 1914) was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania to German immigrants Bernard and Sarah Rees. Charles started his career as a daguerreotypist in Cincinnati around 1850. In 1851, Charles and his brother Edwin opened a studio in Richmond, Virginia near the Capitol. By 1853, Charles had relocated to the former studio of Harrison and Holmes at 289 Broadway, NYC, in what was then the new photographic industry&#x27;s epicenter. Lower Manhattan contained the studios of some of the best photographers in the business, such as Henry Ulke, Mathew Brady, Jeremiah Gurney, Edward Anthony and Abraham Bogardus. Competition was fierce so &quot;Professor&quot; Rees passed himself off as a European political refugee with an innovative &quot;German method of picture making.&quot; This method employed a division of labor in which all the process&#x27; steps were done by a so-called &quot;expert.&quot; To compete, Charles cut his prices on portraits to twenty-five cents for a 1/9th plate and sixty-two cents with a case, a low price even by 1850 standards. After only a little more than two years in business, Charles moved from New York City. By 1859, 30 y.o. Charles, with his brother Edwin, returned to the soon-to-be capital of the Confederacy, Richmond, Virginia and again set up shop. They called their new studio &quot;Rees&#x27; Steam Gallery.&quot; At the beginning of the Civil War, the influx of politicians and particularly soldiers meant a dramatic increase in business, and the brothers were kept busy with hundreds of new recruits flocking to their gallery. Caught up in the patriotic fervor of the time, Charles soon joined the 19th Virginia Militia, a regiment made up of shopkeepers, railroad workers and local firemen, who were used primarily as prison guards, but who were also used in extreme emergencies. As the war progressed, acute shortages of everything was the norm and most retail shops in Richmond, including Rees&#x27; studio, eventually closed down altogether. As Grant advanced on Petersburg on April 3, 1863, Richmond was evacuated. General Ewell ordered Richmond&#x27;s warehouses put to the torch. The fires soon got out of control and engulfed the entire business district, including the Rees Brothers&#x27; studio. However, almost as soon as the fires were put out rebuilding soon began and Rees was back in business at a new studio named &quot;Rees &amp; Bro.&quot; at 913 Main Street. Then, in 1880, for reasons not entirely clear Charles relocated his studio to Petersburg, Virginia, setting up shop at the J. E. Rockwell Gallery on Sycamore Street. Charles Rees died in 1914 at the age of 84 and was buried in Hollywood Cemetery with his wife Minerva and sons Eddie and Charles Jr. The Rees studio would continue operating under his only surviving child, James Conway Rees. James lived until 1955 and was one of the few men left who might have remembered the Civil War and his father&#x27;s work during that conflict. With the coming of the Great Depression, the Rees Studio in Petersburg took its last photograph and closed its doors.
===Andrew D. Lytle===

Andrew David Lytle (1858–1917) was an itinerant photographer in Cincinnati, Ohio, who worked throughout the mid-South. In 1858, he opened a studio on Main Street in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and for the next half-century recorded the places, events and faces of Louisiana&#x27;s capital city. Lytle&#x27;s remarkable photograph of the 1st Indiana H.A. is just one of many made in Baton Rouge during its occupation by Union forces. After federal forces occupied Baton Rouge in May 1862, Lytle developed a lucrative photographic relationship with the U.S. Army and Navy. Besides providing studio portraits for members of the occupying forces, Lytle photographed the occupying army encampments around Baton Rouge as well as the Navy&#x27;s West Gulf Blockading Squadron under Admiral James Glasgow Farragut and the Mississippi River Squadron. Many of Lytle&#x27;s civil war era works are preserved in the &#x27;Andrew D. Lytle&#x27;s Baton Rouge&#x27; Photograph Collection at Louisiana State University. Lytle&#x27;s studio was so successful during the civil war that he was able to buy property with buildings near the Louisiana Governor&#x27;s Mansion, which became the Lytle family home for the next sixty years. As Louisiana emerged from Reconstruction, Lytle was joined in the business by his son Howard, operating under the name of Lytle Studio and, later, Lytle &amp; Son.
===Julian Vannerson===
Julian Vannerson (1827–?) In 1857, Julian Vannerson was a daguerrean portrait artist and principal operator for the James Earle McClees gallery in Washington, D.C., at 308 Pennsylvania Avenue. In 1859 Vannerson&#x27;s autographed prints were published in &quot;McClees&#x27; gallery of photographic portraits of the senators, representatives &amp; delegates of the thirty-fifth Congress&quot;. His portraiture of Native Americans were part of a systematic effort to document members of treaty delegations who came to Washington, D.C. After the Civil War broke out, operating out of Richmond, Vannerson continued making portraits of famous Confederate general officers, using his preferred method, the &quot;salt&quot; print. He is best known for his portrait photographs of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and J.E.B. Stuart and Stonewall Jackson. Vannerson closed his business and sold his equipment at war&#x27;s end.

==Clandestine photography==
===Andrew David Lytle===

In 1910 an agent for The Reviews of Reviews Company, New York, publisher of &quot;The Photographic History of the Civil War&quot;, purchased most of the surviving negatives Baton Rouge photographer Andrew Lytle had created during the Federal occupation of Baton Rouge. The agent also spoke to Howard Lytle about the role his father had played in the war. From that conversation and the subsequent write up in &quot;The Photographic History&quot; the story of Lytle as &quot;camera spy for the Confederacy&quot; was born. Other than this tale, told fifty years after the fact to a journalist, there is no record any espionage by Lytle. The photographic equipment of the time, including that used by Lytle, involved bulky cameras and large, heavy tripods. The cameras used wet-plate collodion glass-plate negatives with fairly long exposure times. Photographing in the field, a photographer needed a darkroom wagon nearby for preparing the wet plates for exposure and developing them after exposure before they dried. Without a darkroom wagon, a photographer would have required a system of runners or horsemen to relay the wet plates between his studio, the photographic site in the field, and back to his studio.

===Robert M. Smith===
Confederate Lieutenant Robert M. Smith was captured and imprisoned at Johnson&#x27;s Island, Ohio. He is unique in that he was able to secretly construct a wet-plate camera using a pine box, pocket knife, tin can, and spyglass lens. Smith acquired chemicals from the prison hospital to use for the photographic process. He used the camera clandestinely to photograph other prisoners at the gable end of the attic of cell block four. No other prison had an on-site photographer providing images for the imprisoned to send home. His contribution is well presented in David R. Bush&#x27;s &quot;I Fear I Shall Never Leave This Island: Life in a Civil War Prison (2011).&quot;

==Itinerant photographers==
Itinerant (traveling) photographers received permission from a commanding general to establish themselves within an encampment, primarily for the lucrative purpose of making portraits for the soldiers, which could then be sent to loved ones as a memento.

==Taxes==
In September 1862, Northern photographic studios were required to purchase an annual license. By August 1864, photographers would have to buy revenue stamps as well. The &quot;Sun Picture&quot; tax on photographs was instituted by the Office of Internal Revenue as a means to help finance the war. The tax was either 1¢, 2¢, 3¢, or 5¢, depending on the price of the photo (1–10¢, 10–25¢, 25–50¢, 50–$1 respectively). However, there was not a special stamp created for photography, so, US revenue stamps originally intended for Bank Checks, Playing Cards, Certificates, Proprietary, Bills of Lading, &amp;c. were used. Largely due to the lobbying efforts of Alexander Gardner, Mathew Brady, Jeremiah Gurney and Charles D. Fredericks, the tax was repealed in 1866.

==Copyright==
In 1854, James Ambrose Cutting and his partner, Isaac A. Rehn, took out three patents that were &quot;improvements&quot; in the wet-plate collodion process. Cutting developed a method for adhering the two pieces of glass together using Canada balsam. Though meant as a way to hermetically seal the ambrotypes as a preservation method, the process was ultimately unnecessary as the varnish layer itself worked extremely well as a protectant. In fact, ambrotypes that utilized Cutting&#x27;s patent are known to exhibit deterioration caused by the technique. Numerous high-profile lawsuits (E. Anthony, J. Gurney, C.D. Fredericks, J. Bogardus) and disputes surrounding the patents may have had an intimidating effect, and discouraged a wider use of &quot;instantaneous&quot; (stop action) photography during the Civil War. Cutting&#x27;s patented formula featured the chemical component, bromide of potassium, which greatly enhanced the sensitivity of the collodion. When the patent extensions came up for renewal in 1868, the Patent Office decided that the original patents should not have been issued, and the extension was denied. The decision was partly based on evidence found in Henry Snelling&#x27;s book, &quot;The History and Practice of Photography.&quot; Snelling in 1853 had described the use of the same key ingredients found in Cutting&#x27;s high-speed, emulsion.

Another widespread concern of 19th century photographers was the lack of copyright protection, something the &quot;Philadelphia Photographer&quot; termed &quot;piratical stealing&quot;. In 1870 H.R. 1714 was passed by the 41st Congress. The interpolations made in the new law were due primarily to the influence of Alexander Gardner.

==Legacy==
The results of the efforts of all Civil War photographers can be seen in almost all of the history texts of the conflict. In terms of photography, the American Civil War is the best covered conflict of the 19th century. It presaged the development of the wartime photojournalism of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.

The number of Civil War photographs that are available contrasts sharply with the scarcity of pictures from subsequent conflicts such as the Russian wars in Central Asia, the Franco-Prussian War, and the various colonial wars before the Boer War.

<text>Günther Nenning (December 23, 1921 – May 14, 2006) was an Austrian journalist, author, and political activist.

Günther Nenning was born in Vienna, Austria. After an excellent performance in high school, Nenning served from 1940 to 1945 in the German Wehrmacht. At the end of World War II he was arrested by US forces, but soon released on condition that he stay in the Western sector. He studied linguistics and religious studies in Graz, being promoted Dr. phil. and Dr. rer. pol. in 1949 and 1959 respectively.

He died in Waidring, Tyrol aged 84.

== Journalism ==

During his studies he started his journalistic career, first as a writer, later as vice chief editor of the socialist daily newspaper &quot;Neue Zeit&quot;. In 1958 he switched as co-owner to the cultural journal FORVM in Vienna, in 1965 he followed Friedrich Torberg as owner and chief editor, changing the name to &quot;NEUES FORVM&quot;. Nenning left the journal in 1970, handing it over as community property to a club of writers and employees. He founded a youth journal in 1973, but due to legal and financial problems had to stop it in 1975. Since the early 1970s he wrote as a columnist for major Austrian newspapers.

Joining the socialist faction of the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB), in 1960 he became chairman of the Austrian Journalists&#x27; Union. Accused of intending to form his own media union, in 1985 he was expelled from the Austrian Trade Union Federation, causing hundreds of journalists to leave the ÖGB in protest. In 1990 he was fully rehabilitated, and received honors for 50 years of membership in 2000.

== Politics ==

Nenning&#x27;s political views were &quot;multicolored&quot;, and not confined to a single party. He termed himself &quot;Rot–grün–hellschwarzer&quot; (red–green–light-black, referring to socialism, greens and conservatism). He participated in the protests for an Austrian media reform in 1964, in the early 1970s against the war in Vietnam, and in 1978 against the planned nuclear power plant in Zwentendorf.

In 1984 he was one of the leading protesters against the Danube power plant at Hainburg, which earned him the nickname &quot;Auhirsch&quot; (meadow deer). He was one of the most influential mentors in the early years of the then forming Austrian Green Party. His green activities and ecologically motivated rants against socialist members of parliament caused the Austrian socialist party to expel him in 1985. A month later Nenning joined the Swiss socialist party.

Nenning had always been an ardent activist for women&#x27;s rights, and called himself a convinced feminist.

== Books and TV ==

Günther Nenning was a prolific author, who also directed TV movies and a documentary for the ORF (Austrian television). Among others, he was TV host of the talk show &quot;Club 2&quot; (ORF) and host of the German TV talk show &quot;III nach 9&quot; (ARD). In addition to his many authored books, Nenning spent the final year of his life editing a 21-volume anthology of Austrian literature after 1945, first called &quot;Austrokoffer&quot; (Austro-suitcase; it was designed to fit in a large, brightly decorated carrying case) and then received the less controversial title of &quot;Landvermessung&quot; (Land-measuring or Land-surveying). It became a cause celebre when critics felt that Nenning was unqualified to edit such a collection and some major authors like Elfriede Jelinek refused to contribute work due to government funding of the project. 139 authors eventually found representation in the well-designed collection, which had to be issued in a second limited edition due to public demand.

<doc id="570212" wikidata="Q5422619" url="?curid=570212" title="Eye Guess">
<text>Eye Guess is an American game show created by Bob Stewart and hosted by Bill Cullen that aired on NBC from January 3, 1966, to September 26, 1969. The game combined a general knowledge quiz with a &quot;Concentration&quot;-style memory element, in which the answers were shown to the players and their recall of their positions was tested.

This was the first game show by Bob Stewart Productions. Stewart, a former producer for Goodson-Todman Productions, created this series and packaged it with Filmways. Don Pardo announced for the first year, after which Jack Clark replaced him for the rest of the run.

The show used the Al Hirt tune &quot;Sugar Lips&quot; as its theme song.

==Gameplay==
Two contestants faced a nine-space game board divided into three rows of three boxes. The outer boxes were numbered 1–8, and the center box contained the &quot;Eye Guess&quot; logo. At the beginning of the game, the answers hidden behind the outer boxes were revealed for six-to-nine seconds, then re-covered. Questions were asked by the host, and contestants were required to provide only the number behind which the answer was hidden. Points were awarded for a correct answer, and the contestant who responded correctly was asked another question. As long as they responded correctly, they would continue to be asked questions. If the contestant answered incorrectly, that contestant&#x27;s turn ended and the opponent was asked the next question. No points were deducted for an incorrect answer.

A contestant could call for the &quot;Eye Guess&quot; space if they thought that the correct answer was not among the eight choices revealed at the start of the game. In such instances, the answer would be revealed only if it was correct for that question. Otherwise, a blank card would be revealed.

Questions in each round covered a wide range of topics and were assembled so that choosing an incorrect number for a question could yield humorous results, which was the main appeal of this otherwise simple game.

Each game consisted of two rounds, with correct answers worth 10 points in the first round and 20 in the second. Although there were nine different answers per round, each round featured only eight questions, meaning that one of the nine answers was not used (and never placed behind the &quot;Eye Guess&quot; space). A contestant who provided five consecutive correct answers won a bonus prize, usually a trip. Toward the end of the show&#x27;s run, when both contestants missed four consecutive questions in the main game, both received a series of at-home memory improvement books.

The first contestant to reach 100 points won the game and earned the right to play a bonus round. Later, the producers changed the rules, awarding a prize for each correct answer, with seven as the winning score.

Each episode was played to a time limit, and when that limit was reached, an audible signal was played. If a game was in progress when time was called, it would resume on the next show, with any unrevealed answers shuffled into different positions. If time was called during the bonus round, the board was left as it was and the contestant resumed playing on the next show.

There were no returning champions. Each game featured two new contestants.

The game in progress during the final installment of the series did not finish in time. Because there could be no continuation of the game on the following Monday&#x27;s broadcast, host Bill Cullen explained that the contestants would play the game to its conclusion after the show was over, and the appropriate prizes would be awarded.

==Bonus round==
The first bonus round was played from January 3–14, 1966. The contestant was shown eight pairs of celebrities (a man and woman). Cullen would read a name, and the contestant would be required to locate that celebrity&#x27;s spouse on the board. Each correct answer awarded the contestant $25, and a new car was awarded if the board was cleared.

The second bonus round was used from January 17, 1966, to August 30, 1968. Behind seven of the numbers on the board were various prizes; behind the remaining number, a &quot;Stop!&quot; card. The contestant continued to call numbers and win prizes until finding the &quot;Stop!&quot; card. If the contestant revealed all seven prizes, the contestant won a new car, ostensibly hidden behind the &quot;Eye Guess&quot; logo. The contestant kept any prizes revealed prior to the end of the round. If the &quot;Stop!&quot; card was revealed on the first selection, the contestant was allowed to choose another number as a consolation prize.

In one 1967 episode, the prize card for the car was placed behind the #7 slot by mistake instead of the &quot;Eye Guess&quot; slot. Unaware of this, the contestant called out number 7, revealing the prize card for the car. Instead of restarting the bonus round and editing the tape, the episode aired with this mistake and the contestant was awarded every prize on the board, including the car.

This bonus round is featured in all four editions of the show&#x27;s home game.

Initially, prizes consisted of cash up to $100 or merchandise. By November 10, 1967, all prizes became merchandise. At some point after that date, a new prize called &quot;Jack&#x27;s Pot&quot; (named after announcer Jack Clark) was introduced, consisting of a cash prize that was awarded only if it were revealed on the first selection. If this did not happen, its location was revealed right away. The value started at $100 and increased by $100 each day until won.

The third bonus round, known as &quot;The Risk Board&quot;, was used for the entire final year of the show&#x27;s run, from September 2, 1968, to September 26, 1969. Hidden behind spaces 1–3 and 6–8 were five &quot;Go&quot; cards and one &quot;Stop!&quot; sign (spaces in the middle row were not used in this format). Prizes of increasing value were awarded after each &quot;Go&quot; card was found. The contestant could stop at any point but lost all the prizes accumulated if the &quot;Stop!&quot; card was revealed. If all five &quot;Go&quot; cards were revealed without finding the &quot;Stop!&quot; card, the contestant won a new car.

==Attempted revivals==

===Punch Lines (1979)===
In December 1979, a pilot was shot for a revival of &quot;Eye Guess&quot; and was pitched to local stations by syndicator Metromedia Producers Corporation for the 1980 season. Called &quot;Punch Lines&quot; and also hosted by Bill Cullen, the premise of the game was for eight comedic performers to hold &quot;punch lines&quot; that would complete statements that the host would read to the two celebrity-contestant teams. As with &quot;Eye Guess&quot;, the object was to remember where the correct punch line was located. Similar to &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, the humor came from the comically mismatched answers and over-the-top line readings given by the performers. Some of the celebrities who were featured in the pilot were Joyce Bulifant, Fred Grandy and Edie McClurg.

Although the show failed to sell in America, it was sold two years later in the U.K. for ITV and had a successful three-year run with Lennie Bennett as its host from January 3, 1981, until December 22, 1984. In addition, Bennett would also host the U.K. adaptation of another Bob Stewart-created game show, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, as &quot;Lucky Ladders&quot;, running on the same network from March 21, 1988, until May 14, 1993.

Two years later, a pilot for an Australian adaptation of the show, hosted by Jeremy Kewley, was shot for the Seven Network on August 20, 1986. However, like its American counterpart, the series failed to sell.

===Eye Q (1988)===
Another pilot was shot for a revival of &quot;Eye Guess&quot; at CBS Television City in August 1988. Called &quot;Eye Q&quot; and hosted by Henry Polic II, the premise of the game was slightly different. Two couples played against each other, but instead of being shown the answers at the beginning of the game, they were revealed as the game progressed. This made the game more like &quot;Concentration&quot;, for instead of simply recalling where an answer was based on what was revealed at the beginning of the round, the couples had to remember where the answer was after it was revealed.

The winning couple won $500 and a chance to win up to $50,000 in a bingo-based bonus game. Sixteen numbers were randomly scrambled before the bonus game, and the result of the scramble was hidden behind the winning team. They had a choice of eight of the numbers, and the object was to form a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line. On completing a line, the couple won a cash jackpot, which, on the pilot, had reached $11,000. If the line was completed with the first four numbers that the couple chose, they won $50,000.

==Home version==
Milton Bradley issued four editions of the board game during the show&#x27;s run. The first three feature Bill Cullen&#x27;s likeness on the boxes.

<text>The AquaDom (mixed Latin and German: &#x27;water dome&#x27;, more formally &#x27;water cathedral&#x27;) was a cylindrical acrylic glass aquarium with built-in transparent elevator inside the lobby of the Radisson Collection Hotel in the DomAquarée complex at Karl-Liebknecht-Straße in Berlin-Mitte, Germany. The DomAquarée complex also contains offices, a museum, a restaurant, and the Berlin Sea Life Centre aquarium. 

On 16 December 2022, the AquaDom aquarium ruptured and collapsed, propelling the 1,500 fish inside into nearby facilities and streets, causing considerable damage and killing the majority of the fish. As of early 2024, plans were to forego rebuilding the tank and instead develop an indoor garden in the hotel lobby.

== Construction ==
The AquaDom opened on 2 December 2003 at a cost of about 12.8 million euros. The acrylic cylinder was manufactured by International Concept Management, Inc. using Reynolds Polymer Technology panels, with architecture drawings provided by Sergei Tchoban. It was located in the same building as the Berlin Sea Life attraction but was owned and operated by Union Investment.

The aquarium was constructed from 41 acrylic panels – 26 panels for the outside cylinder and 15 panels for the inside cylinder for the elevator – which were bonded together on site. With a diameter of about and a height of about , resting on a tall foundation, it held the Guinness World Record for the world&#x27;s largest cylindrical aquarium.

== Operation ==

The water column was high, held of saltwater and accommodated about 1,500 tropical fish from over 100 species. A team of scuba divers conducted daily feedings, with of feed-fish, and cleaned the tank daily. According to Union Investment, the owner of the complex, the wall thickness of the outer acrylic cylinder was at the bottom and at the top. The water temperature was kept at .

In 2020, the aquarium was refurbished and upgraded, with all the water drained and the fish temporarily relocated to a breeding facility in the basement. According to the owner, seals were renewed at the base and an additional sealing level was fitted. The cylinder was repaired and polished in places. Maintenance work on the elevator was conducted.

== Collapse and aftermath ==

The cylindrical tank burst at 5:43 am local time (4:43 am GMT) on 16 December 2022, sending approximately of water together with the tank&#x27;s 1,500 fish into the hotel lobby and adjacent street. Sandra Weeser, a member of Germany&#x27;s Bundestag staying at the hotel at the time, described awakening to &quot;a kind of shock wave&quot;.

Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Technisches Hilfswerk&quot; (THW) rescue team mounted a full-scale deployment, completing operations 12 hours later — with the hotel&#x27;s lobby and atrium remaining devastated, described by onlookers as resembling a battlefield. 

The majority of the 1,500 fish were killed and two people were hospitalized with injuries. Officials noted the collapse could easily have taken several lives had it taken place during the hotel&#x27;s busier operational hours. 

Detected by local seismographs, the collapse sent the water out of the hotel lobby and into nearby storm drains, but not before damaging several nearby businesses, including a neighboring Lindt chocolate shop and the basement of the adjacent DDR Museum, the latter which reopened three and a half months later. An associated power loss threatened hundreds of smaller fish in the facility&#x27;s breeding tanks, which were ultimately rescued. 

With no suspicion of foul play, and prior to a formal investigation, suspected causes included material fatigue, exacerbated by the difference between Berlin&#x27;s very low air temperature ( that night), and the tank&#x27;s water temperature ().

On 24 October 2023, prosecutors closed the investigation into the rupture after experts failed to determine a conclusive cause.

<doc id="570216" wikidata="Q80431" url="?curid=570216" title="Zordon">
<text>Zordon is a fictional character from the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise who serves as the Rangers&#x27; mentor. Zordon first appeared on the first season of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; and appeared in subsequent seasons until the conclusion of &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot;, where he was the titular major supporting character of his saga.

==Character biography==
Ten thousand years ago, Zordon clashes with his nemesis, Rita Repulsa, on Earth. During their final battle, Rita traps Zordon in a time warp while Zordon seals Rita and her minions away in a &quot;Dumpster&quot; on the Moon. After the battle ends, Zordon, with the aid of his robot assistant, Alpha 5, creates a Command Center in the California desert outside the town of Angel Grove. He then creates the Power Morphers, the Power Coins and the Dinozords. When Rita Repulsa is released from the Dumpster, Zordon recruits five teenagers from Angel Grove – Jason Lee Scott, Zack Taylor, Kimberly Hart, Trini Kwan, and Billy Cranston – to become the Power Rangers, giving them the Power Morphers, the Power Coins, and the Dinozords to battle Rita.

Zordon guides the Rangers over several years, creating the Zeo and Turbo powers to combat the threats of the Machine Empire and Divatox. Over time, Zordon upgrades the Command Center into the Power Chamber.

Zordon and Alpha leave Earth for Eltar, leaving the Turbo Rangers under the guidance of Dimitria and her assistant, Alpha 6, but return a short while later to attend the transfer of the Turbo powers to T.J., Cassie, Carlos and Ashley.

Months after his departure, Zordon is captured by Dark Specter, who slowly drains him of his powers, leaving the former Turbo Rangers to become the Space Rangers as they try to find and rescue him. Soon afterwards, Dark Specter launches his conquest of the universe and moves Zordon to the Dark Fortress, Astronema&#x27;s base. After Dark Specter is killed by Darkonda who, in turn is also killed by the latter, Andros, the Red Space Ranger, travels to the Dark Fortress and finds Zordon. Zordon convinces Andros to shatter his energy tube, allowing his good energy to destroy the forces of evil. Zordon&#x27;s death creates an energy wave that travels throughout the universe, turning Lord Zedd, Rita, and Divatox into humans, Astronema into her former self Karone, and the other villains into sand.

In the reunion movie &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;, Billy Cranston attempts to resurrect Zordon by gathering the energy dispersed at the moment of death, but accidentally revives the evil that had been expunged from Rita by the energy wave. This evil possesses Alpha 8 and becomes Robo-Rita, who terrorizes the world and plans to go back in time to kill all the Power Rangers before Zordon can recruit them, thus sealing her ultimate victory over Zordon. The Power Rangers manage to defeat her before she can initiate her plan.

In &quot;Power Rangers Cosmic Fury&quot;, Aiyon’s consciousness follows a dying Zayto into the Morphin Grid. He encounters someone who looks like Zayto but with blue eyes and no memory of him. The apparition tells him Zayto is dead and that Aiyon’s friends need him. He returns Aiyon’s consciousness with parting words he said he used to say in such times, “May the power protect you.” After Aiyon relates his encounter, Billy feels encouraged that Zordon is indeed still alive and could possibly be rescued.

==In other media==

===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;===
In the 1995 film, Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa free Ivan Ooze, who destroys the Command Center and Zordon&#x27;s energy tube, leaving him on the verge of death. With Zordon dying, the Rangers travel to Phaedos in order to obtain the Great Power needed to revive him. After achieving their goal on Phaedos with the help of Dulcea, the Rangers return to Earth and defeat Ivan Ooze. Having succeeded, they return to the Command Center to find Zordon has died. The Rangers then use the Great Power to repair the Command Center and bring Zordon back to life.

===&quot;Power Rangers&quot; (2017 film)===

Bryan Cranston portrays Zordon in the 2017 film, as a mixture of motion capture and CGI. Zordon is the former Red Ranger, who has become part of the Morphing Grid after his body was destroyed by a meteor he called down to destroy renegade Green Ranger Rita Repulsa, who had destroyed the rest of his team. Millennia later, after the new Ranger team is drawn together by the Power Coins to respond to the threat of the revived Rita, Jason overhears that Zordon, who has become desperate since the new Rangers fail to come together, intends to use the convergence of the Morphing Grid that will occur when the new Rangers connect to their powers for the first time to restore himself to a corporeal body to stop Rita. Jason then falsely accuses Zordon of using the team for his own agenda; however, when Billy Cranston is drowned by Rita after she forces him to reveal the location of the Zeo Crystal, the other four Rangers affirm their willingness to die for each other as Billy died for them, triggering the convergence Zordon anticipated, only for Zordon to sacrifice the chance to restore himself to bring Billy back to life, showing Zordon&#x27;s faith in his successors. With Rita&#x27;s defeat, Zordon congratulates the Rangers, assuring them that their names will be remembered with honor among the other great Rangers of history.

===Boom! Studios Comics===
The comic book series features Zordon in an alternate continuity starting in the original series shortly after Tommy joined the team. One early crisis sees the Rangers encounter an alternate reality where Tommy chose to remain evil even after Rita&#x27;s spell was broken, adopting the alias &quot;Lord Drakkon&quot;, which led to the destruction of the Command Centre in that world. When the two worlds initially make contact, Zordon spoke with his counterpart, affirming that he has faith that his version of Tommy will not follow Drakkon&#x27;s example. 

Later storylines reveal that Zordon formed a team of Rangers in 1969 prior to the modern team, to stop Psycho Green when he arrived on Earth&#x27;s moon, this team consisting of five different adults from all over the world. While these Rangers managed to stop Psycho Green, they failed to work as a proper team due to their differing views, which resulted in three of them dying before Psycho Green was defeated. In the present day, Grace Sterling- the Red Ranger of this team- has formed the organisation Prometheus, working to protect Earth through advanced science based on what she witnessed in her time as a Ranger, and has a tense relationship with Zordon, as they both seek to protect Earth but Grace feels that Zordon should do more for the world while Zordon is bound by certain rules preventing him from taking a more active involvement in Earth&#x27;s affairs.

When Lord Drakkon comes to attack Earth, Zordon appeals to the Morphing Masters- manifestations of the Morphing Grid itself- for help stopping Drakkon when his actions lead to Tommy being killed and cause reality to split into multiple timelines as Drakkon tries to harness the power of the Morphing Grid for himself. The Masters dismiss Zordon&#x27;s concern about Drakkon, and declare that attempting to contact them like this has cost him the chance to join them after Zordon&#x27;s own death. Ultimately Drakkon&#x27;s attack allows him to restructure reality to a timeline that fits Drakkon&#x27;s goal, but through a temporal paradox Tommy is able to restore himself to existence and rally his team to rebuild reality. 

Once reality has been restored, Zordon is disturbed when Billy is revealed to have been working with Prometheus, finding a way to recharge the Green Power Coin using Chaos energy. As a result, Kimberly&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Matt is chosen as a Prometheus-sponsored Green Ranger shortly before Earth is attacked by the forces of Eltar, Zordon&#x27;s home planet. Zartus, the leader of this assault, was once a friend of Zordon, but Zartus has become convinced that any world that does not measure up to his standards must be destroyed, prompting Zordon to declare his allegiance to Earth over Eltar and help the Rangers oppose his former friend. The Command Centre is nearly destroyed in the subsequent conflict, but Billy reveals that he has created a system that transferred Zordon from his time warp into a new containment suit that allows Zordon to move and fight alongside the Rangers. During the campaign, Zordon learns that Lord Zedd was once his friend Zophram, the Supreme Guardian of Eltar, who was disfigured into his current state after he tried to steal the Zeo Crystal, who blames Zordon for what happened to him. Ultimately Zordon and Zedd join forces to stop Zartus, and Zedd returns his old friend to the Rangers, but makes it clear that he will not abandon his campaign against Earth. The Rangers are ultimately able to retrieve a new Command Centre from another world and restore Zordon to the warp after Billy&#x27;s containment suit proves to be too dangerous to use long-term.

<text>Lewis Silkin, 1st Baron Silkin CH (14 November 1889 – 11 May 1972), was a British Labour Party politician.
== Career ==
Lewis Silkin was born on 14 November 1889 to Abraham and Fanny Silkin, who were Litvak Jews from what was then the Lithuanian part of the Russian Empire. His parents came to settle in the East End of London and were of modest means, Abraham cleaned the toilets of the Synagogue, gave Hebrew lessons and sold fruit off a barrow. Lewis had several siblings, including Joseph Silkin (father of the poet Jon Silkin) who he worked with as a solicitor and with whom he co-founded Silkin and Silkin. In 1950 he founded Lewis Silkin &amp; Partners together with his son John. This is the London law firm where he practised and which still bears his name. He became a member of the London County Council in 1925. He chaired the LCC Town Planning and the Housing and Public Health Committees and was a member of the Central Housing Advisory Committee.

He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Peckham in 1936, and was a member of the Select committee on National Expenditure. He was Minister of Town and Country Planning in the Government of Clement Attlee from 1945 until he retired in 1950. He appointed Clough Williams-Ellis as the first Chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation in 1946, with Monica Felton as the first woman Deputy Chairman. (who then became the first female chairman between 1949 and 1951) and appointed Baroness Denington as the second female chairman of the same corporation in 1966.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Honours ==

Silkin was raised to the peerage as Baron Silkin, of Dulwich in the County of London, in the 1950 Birthday Honours. He was further honoured in 1965 when he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour. Of his three sons, his eldest, Arthur, a civil servant, disclaimed the peerage. The other two, Samuel and John, both followed him into Parliament and became members of the Privy Council as well as Government Ministers. Although Samuel refused a knighthood as Attorney-General, he eventually became a life peer as Baron Silkin of Dulwich, of North Leigh in the County of Oxfordshire.

Samuel&#x27;s son Christopher also disclaimed the hereditary peerage on the death of his uncle Arthur in 2001, the first time a peerage has been disclaimed twice.

<doc id="570221" wikidata="Q251335" url="?curid=570221" title="Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla">
<text>is a 1974 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Jun Fukuda, with special effects by Teruyoshi Nakano. Distributed by Toho and produced under their effects subsidiary Toho–Eizo, it is the 14th film of the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, and features the fictional monster characters Godzilla, Anguirus, and King Caesar, along with the mecha character Mechagodzilla. The film stars Masaaki Daimon, Kazuya Aoyama, Gorō Mutsumi, and Akihiko Hirata, with Isao Zushi as Godzilla, Satoru Kuzumi as both Anguirus and King Caesar, and Kazunari Mori as Mechagodzilla. The film marks the first appearances of King Caesar and Mechagodzilla in the franchise.

&quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on March 21, 1974, to generally positive reviews. The film received a limited release in the United States in 1977 by Cinema Shares, under the title Godzilla vs. the Bionic Monster. It was then quickly re-released under the title Godzilla vs. the Cosmic Monster which was also the UK theatrical title. The film was followed up with a direct sequel in 1975 titled &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot;.

==Plot==
In Okinawa, an Azumi priestess has a vision of a city being destroyed by a giant monster. Meanwhile, Masahiko Shimizu discovers a type of metal not found on Earth while spelunking and takes it to Professor Miyajima for examination. An excavation led by Masahiko&#x27;s brother Keisuke uncovers a chamber filled with ancient artifacts and a mural bearing an ominous prophecy: &quot;When a black mountain appears above the clouds, a huge monster will arise and try to destroy the world; but when the red moon sets and the sun rises in the west, two monsters shall appear to save the people.&quot; Keisuke is joined by archaeologist Saeko Kaneshiro, who translates the prophecy and takes a statue bearing the likeness of Okinawa&#x27;s guardian monster King Caesar to study. Two men stalk them, one claiming to be a reporter while the other attempts to steal the statue, but fails and flees.

Following the appearance of a black cloud resembling a mountain, the Godzilla imposter emerges from Mount Fuji and begins a destructive rampage. Godzilla&#x27;s ally, Anguirus, confronts the Godzilla imposter, only to be injured and forced to retreat. Keisuke arrives shortly after to check on Masahiko and Miyajima. As the Godzilla imposter&#x27;s rampage continues, the real Godzilla emerges to expose his imposter, which reveals to be Mechagodzilla, a massive mecha with advanced weaponry made of same metal called space titanium. Godzilla is severely wounded, but inflicts some damage on Mechagodzilla before both monsters retreat. Miyajima hypothesizes, based on Mechagodzilla&#x27;s advanced technology and composition, that a mecha is an extraterrestrial superweapon.

Keisuke and Saeko take the statue back to the temple, but are confronted by the thief once again. During the fight, the skin on half of the stranger&#x27;s face melts away, revealing an ape-like alien from the Third Planet of the Black Hole called Simeon. The Simeon intruder attempts to kill Keisuke, but an unseen gunman kills him before Keisuke and Saeko catch a brief glimpse of the reporter. Concurrently, Godzilla arrives on Monster Island during a thunderstorm and is struck by lightning multiple times, reinvigorating himself.

Masahiko, Miyajima and his daughter Ikuko explore the cave where the space titanium was first found, but are captured by Simeons, who plan to use Mechagodzilla to conquer Earth. Their commander, Kuronuma, forces Miyajima to repair the mecha. While Saeko checks into a hotel and guards the statue, Keisuke leaves to meet Masahiko at the caves, only to encounter the reporter, who reveals himself as Nanbara, an Interpol agent who has been tracking the Simeons. After Nanbara and Keisuke infiltrate Simeon base and free the prisoners, Keisuke and Ikuko leave to pick up Saeko and the statue while Miyajima, Nanbara, and Masahiko stay behind, only to be recaptured by Kuronuma.

The next morning, a lunar eclipse results in a red moon and a mirage of the sun rising in the west. Seeing this, the team realizes they have to awaken Caesar. They meet with the priestess and her grandfather and place the statue in the temple, revealing Caesar&#x27;s resting place. As Kuronuma dispatches Mechagodzilla, the priestess sings to awaken Caesar and Godzilla appears shortly afterward. The two monsters join forces to fight Mechagodzilla. When the mecha tries to escape, Godzilla uses his stored electricity to create an electromagnetic field to attract Mechagodzilla before tearing off its head, destroying Mechagodzilla in the process. While the mortified Simeons are distracted, Nanbara and the others free themselves, kill their captors, and sabotage the base, fleeing as it explodes. With the enemy defeated, Godzilla heads out to the ocean and Caesar returns to his resting place while the humans rejoice.

==Cast==
==Production==
As with all previous entries in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; film series, the &quot;kaiju&quot; characters featured in &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot; were depicted through suitmation. The body of the Mechagodzilla suit, worn by suit actor Kazunari Mori, was made from a polyethylene material, while the suit&#x27;s head and hands were made using fibre-reinforced plastic.

===King Caesar===
King Caesar&#x27;s name and design are based on Shisa, which are artistically embellished stone lion statues common in Okinawa, where the film took place. They are an Okinawan variation on the Chinese guardian lion (石獅; Shishi, meaning &quot;Stone Lion&quot;), which in turn originates from Buddhist tradition in India, where Asiatic lions are native. Shisa only loosely resemble actual lions on account of being based on second-hand descriptions by people who had never seen one in person. In the 1970s, general East Asian folklore were relatively unknown to Western audiences, which resulted in the translators interpreting name &quot;Shisa&quot; to be a Japanization of the name &quot;Caesar&quot;.

Caesar&#x27;s character concept was inspired by a traditional Okinawan folk tale in which a Shisa protects a village from a rampaging dragon. This myth is referenced in his debut film, in which Mechagodzilla plays the role of the evil &quot;dragon&quot;. It is portrayed as a loyal and powerful protector of mankind, in reference to the role Shisa play in Okinawan tradition. Character profiles in supporting media describe the monster as standing tall and weighing 30,000 tonnes (33,069 short tons)-50,000 tonnes (55,115 short tons). King Caesar is shown to be swift and athletic. It can also draw an enemy&#x27;s energy weapons into its right eye and reflect them back from its left eye with ten times the force, and empower itself with solar energy.

==Release==
 &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot; was released in Japan on March 21, 1974, where it was distributed by Toho. The film was followed up with a direct sequel in 1975 titled &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot;.

The film was released in the United States in March 1977. It was released by Cinema Shares in the United States under the title &quot;Godzilla vs. the Bionic Monster&quot; where the film was shown predominantly at Saturday &quot;kiddie&quot; matinees. The Cinema Shares theatrical version deleted four minutes of credits, profanity and blood-letting from the film. Universal Television threatened to sue Cinema Shares over the use of the name &quot;Bionic&quot; in the film&#x27;s title, as they owned the rights to &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; TV series. The film title was quickly changed to &quot;Godzilla vs. the Cosmic Monster&quot;, which was also used for the 1977 U.K. theatrical release.

===Box office===
The film made slightly more money than &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot;, but was still not making as big a box office profit as the other films in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series had in the early 1960s. The 1974 Japanese release earned a distribution income (rentals) of . It also grossed overseas, for a worldwide total of about by 1980.

===Home video===
In 1988, New World Video restored the film on home video, using a complete and unedited print titled &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot;. 
In 2004, TriStar released the film on DVD as &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot;, with both English and Japanese audio included. In 2019, both the Japanese version and export English version were included in a Blu-ray box set released by the Criterion Collection, which included all 15 films from the franchise&#x27;s Shōwa era.

===Reception===
In a contemporary review in the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, Tony Rayns stated that at this point in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series, there was no way the film &quot;could have been anything other than formulary, but it could clearly have been much less shambling than it is.&quot; Rayns noted that Shinichi Sekizawa&#x27;s story was &quot;for once, quite ambitious&quot; while noting that the film&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;mythic&#x27; elements are never coherent or impressive enough to match the array of alien technology, and the script seems to forget all about fulfilling its own prophecies as it hurries towards the regulation free-style wrestling climax.&quot;

From retrospective reviews, Stuart Galbraith IV discussed the film in his book on Japanese genre films. Galbraith described the film as a &quot;complete mess&quot;, finding that the aliens in the film were a rip-off of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and that the film had poor effects work and &quot;equally poor direction of Jun Fukuda.&quot; Galbraith opined that the film was &quot;an improvement over &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot;, but that&#x27;s not saying much.&quot; Among the positive attributes, Galbraith noted that Masaru Sato&#x27;s score was interesting and series veterans Akihiko Hirata, Hiroshi Koizumi and Kenji Sahara &quot;make welcome appearances.&quot; In Phil Hardy&#x27;s book &quot;Science Fiction&quot; (1984), a review stated that &quot;the final fight is suitably impressive although the tongue-in-cheek reference to Leone slows the action down too much.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, an approval rating of 86% based on 7 reviews, with a rating average of 6.3/10.&quot;

<doc id="570227" wikidata="Q1444750" url="?curid=570227" title="Godzilla vs. Gigan">
<text>, is a 1972 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Jun Fukuda, written by Shinichi Sekizawa, and produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka, with special effects by Teruyoshi Nakano. Distributed by Toho and produced under their effects-based subsidiary Toho-Eizo, it is the 12th film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, and features the fictional monster characters Godzilla, Gigan, Anguirus, and King Ghidorah. The film stars Hiroshi Ishikawa, Yuriko Hishimi, Tomoko Umeda, and Minoru Takashima, alongside Haruo Nakajima as Godzilla, Kenpachiro Satsuma as Gigan, Koetsu Omiya as Anguirus, and Kanta Ina as Ghidorah. It is the last film in which Godzilla was portrayed by Nakajima after playing the character since the original 1954 film; he subsequently retired from suit acting.

&quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on March 12, 1972. It received a wide theatrical release in the United States in 1977 by Cinema Shares under the title Godzilla on Monster Island and was released in the UK by Miracle Films the same year as War of the Monsters.

The film was followed by the 13th film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot;, released on March 17, 1973.

==Plot==
Giant insectoid aliens resembling cockroaches from the dying planet &quot;M Space Hunter Nebula&quot; plot to colonize the Earth, their planet having become uninhabitable after another race on the planet polluted it, then died out from the effects of their own destruction. The aliens assume the forms of dead humans and work as the development staff of the peace-themed theme park, World Children&#x27;s Land, the centerpiece of which is &quot;Godzilla Tower&quot;. The Nebula M aliens plan to use the space creatures Gigan and King Ghidorah, guided by two &quot;Action Signal Tapes&quot;, to wipe out human civilization.

Manga artist Gengo Kotaka stumbles onto their plan after being hired as a concept artist for the park. When Gengo and his friends accidentally obtain one of the Action Signal Tapes and play it, Godzilla and Anguirus hear the signal and realize something is amiss. Godzilla sends Anguirus to investigate, but when Anguirus approaches Tokyo, the Japan Self-Defense Forces drive it away.

Anguirus reports back to Monster Island, and Godzilla follows it back to Japan to save the Earth from Gigan and Ghidorah. The aliens attempt to kill Godzilla with a lethal laser cannon hidden inside Godzilla Tower, but Gengo and his companions use the aliens&#x27; over-reliance on technology against them, forcing the invaders to unwittingly destroy themselves. After a lengthy fight, Godzilla and Anguirus force Gigan and Ghidorah back into space and then swim back to Monster Island, but not before Godzilla turns around and gives a roar of triumph, in thanks to the human friends.

==Production==
===Writing===
Disappointed with the critical and commercial reception of &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; (1971), Tomoyuki Tanaka immediately began thinking about how to take Godzilla back to the golden era of the 1960’s. Taking note of the Champion Matsuri Festival Reissue of &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; in 1972, which drew in strong attendance of 1,350,000 people (whereas Godzilla vs. Hedorah had 400,000 people), Tanaka felt the best way to reinvigorate Godzilla was not to try new things, but bring back fan-favorite villain King Ghidorah.

He commissioned both Shinichi Sekizawa and Kaoru Mabuchi, to write different drafts for the next Godzilla film. Each of them coming up with their own separate concepts. Both writers were given stipulations from Tanaka though to include King Ghidorah and a new monster, Gigan. Presumably, someone at the studio also insisted upon the Godzilla Tower, as it appears in both writers’ drafts as well. The two drafts were submitted in July 1971.

Kimura&#x27;s draft, titled &quot;Godzilla vs. The Space Monsters: Earth Destruction Directive&quot; (ゴジラ対宇宙怪獣 地球防衛命令, Gojira tai Uchū Kaijū: Chikyū Bōei Meirei) involved Miko, an alien being resembling a large brain, intends to conquer the Earth using King Ghidorah, Gigan, and Megalon (later to be reworked into the main villain in 1973&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot;). However Godzilla and Anguirus appear in Tokyo in defense of Earth. Miko uses the three space monsters to install his being into a giant statue of Majin Tuol, a fictional Inca god, which has been erected at Tokyo&#x27;s Science Land. Gigan uses the buzzsaw in his chest to cut the statue, causing it to bleed. Majin Tuol, now having come to life and inhabiting the statue, allies itself with Godzilla and Anguirus. The three Earth monsters defeat the space creatures and Godzilla destroys Miko. After the decisive battle, Majin Tuol again turns to stone. 

Sekizawa&#x27;s pitch, titled &quot;King Ghidorah&#x27;s Great Counterattack! (キングギドラの大逆襲!, Kingu Gidora no Daigyakushū!)&quot; or &quot;The Return of King Ghidorah&quot;, featured Godzilla, Rodan, and Varan in combat with King Ghidorah, Gigan, and a new monster called Mogu. Except for its monster cast, this draft was reportedly much closer to the final filmed version of &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot;.

===Music===
The majority of the film&#x27;s soundtrack consists of recycled cues from previous Toho films such as &quot;Frankenstein vs. Baragon&quot;, &quot;Atragon&quot;, &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;, &quot;Battle in Outer Space&quot;, and several other &quot;Godzilla&quot; films. Akira Ifukube, who composed the music for those films, receives credit in the film. In addition to those stock tracks, several themes composed by Ifukube for the Mitsubishi Pavilion at Expo &#x27;70 are used throughout the movie. A new song called &quot;Godzilla March&quot;, sung by Susumu Ishikawa and composed by Kunio Miyauchi, plays at the end of the film. Ishikawa also performed two more new songs (&quot;Go! Go! Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Defeat Gigan&quot;) that were released on the soundtrack album.

===Filming===
This was Haruo Nakajima&#x27;s final time playing Godzilla, a role he had played since 1954.

Presumably in order to cut costs, the film relies heavily on stock footage from previous films, such as &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot;, &quot;The War of the Gargantuas&quot; and &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; for Godzilla and King Ghidorah&#x27;s fighting screentime.

This was the first film in which Godzilla actually drew blood. It first happens during the big battle later in the film when Gigan flies over past Godzilla and swipes his shoulder, and later, when Gigan repeatedly strikes a severely weakened Godzilla in his forehead. Also, Anguirus is cut in the snout by Gigan at one point, consequently bleeding towards the camera.

===Creature design===
Gigan was designed by Shōnen Magazine illustrator Takayoshi Mizuki, based on ideas by Teruyoshi Nakano. Mizuki was contacted in early 1971 by Toho production manager Masao Suzuki to design a space monster for a new Godzilla film.

According to Nakano, &quot;the idea for Gigan was to create a monster with quite a different shape,&quot; wanting for the monster to be akin to a &quot;richly colored dinosaur&quot; and also being inspired by the designs of the multilayered jūnihitoe kimonos worn by Japanese court ladies. Mizuki created two potential looks for Gigan, a &quot;triangular&quot; design reminiscent of his final appearance, and a &quot;circular&quot; design sporting a number of hemispheres across its body. Mizuki aimed for a &quot;sharp, florid&quot; look when creating Gigan&#x27;s design, and took inspiration after birds; he based Gigan&#x27;s form on migratory birds such as geese, and adopted the sharpness of an eagle from his neck up.

In this film, King Ghidorah&#x27;s three heads required completely new sculpts to be made, which were created by Nobuyuki Yasumaru. A year later, the suit would be used one final time for the television series &quot;Zone Fighter&quot;, before being formally retired.

==Release==
===Box office===
In Japan, the film sold approximately 1,780,000 tickets. The film earned ¥320 million in Japan distribution income (rentals) and grossed about worldwide.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, approval rating of 67% based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10.

===English version===
Following the film&#x27;s release in Japan in March, 1972, Toho commissioned Hong Kong broadcaster and voice actor Ted Thomas to produce an English language dub. As was usual with Toho&#x27;s international export versions of its films, &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; was left uncut, although the credits were changed to English. One significant change was made for this international version. In the Japanese release, speech bubbles, as seen in comic books, are used to depict a conversation between Godzilla and Anguirus. The speech bubbles were removed in original prints of the English version and the conversation was dubbed into English with Thomas as the voice of Godzilla.

In 1977, Mel Maron&#x27;s Cinema Shares International Distribution purchased the North American rights to &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; and released the film as &quot;Godzilla on Monster Island&quot; in the U.S. Rather than going to the expense of dubbing the film again, Cinema Shares utilized Toho&#x27;s English dub. Aiming for a &quot;G&quot; rating from the MPAA, the company&#x27;s editors removed three instances of blood from the monster scenes and muted the phrase &quot;You&#x27;re a hard bitch&quot; on the soundtrack. Following the theatrical release, &quot;Godzilla on Monster Island&quot; entered television syndication.

In the 1980s, Toho had regained control of the film&#x27;s American distribution rights and licensed the film to New World Pictures. New World&#x27;s home video division released the international version of &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; on video in 1988, fully uncut. Several budget re-releases of the film continued from New World&#x27;s successors over the next decade. Shortly thereafter, the Sci-Fi Channel began broadcasting Cinema Shares&#x27; version, &quot;Godzilla on Monster Island&quot;, in the early 1990s. A letterboxed transfer of Toho&#x27;s international version replaced &quot;Godzilla on Monster Island&quot; on the channel in 2002.

===Home media===
The film received several VHS releases during the 1990s by distributors such as Anchor Bay Entertainment and PolyGram Video. The film was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on October 19, 2004, and on Blu-ray by Kraken Releasing on May 6, 2014. In 2019, the Japanese version was included in a Blu-ray box set released by the Criterion Collection, which included all 15 films from the franchise&#x27;s Shōwa era.

<doc id="570229" wikidata="Q3178948" url="?curid=570229" title="Street sign theft">
<text>Street signs can be stolen for use as decorations or to be sold as scrap metal. Although theft often seems arbitrary, signs with unusual or amusing names tend to be stolen more frequently. Sometimes considered to be a prank by the perpetrators, the theft is often costly and inconvenient for the municipality or agency that owns the sign, and it poses a danger to traffic. In the United States, each street sign generally costs between $100 and $500 to replace.

==In law==
The theft of traffic signage is typically treated like any other theft with respect to prosecution and sentencing. However, people who steal street signs may be found criminally liable for any injury or death resulting from the removal of a sign. In 1997, after a collision which killed three people, three young adults in the United States who stole a stop sign from the intersection where the crash occurred were found guilty of manslaughter. It was the first time street sign theft had led to a manslaughter charge in the country. Thomas Miller, and his friends, Chris Cole and Nissa Baillie were sentenced to between 27 and 46 years in prison, but would go free after only five years after a judge ordered a retrial because the prosecutor had overemphasized certain evidence in her closing arguments. The prosecution declined to bring the case a second time.

==Prevention==
Many jurisdictions place stickers on street signs warning of the legal punishment for their theft. Some cities (e.g. Toronto) use specially designed bolts to attach signs and prevent removal.
With some of the more popular street names such as Liverpool&#x27;s famous &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, authorities gave up the practice of constantly replacing signs and simply resorted to painting the name of the street on the walls. Other jurisdictions offer replica street signs for sale as a legitimate alternative to theft. For route markers or mile markers that contain numbers with suggestive meanings, such as 69, 420, or 666, the number may be changed to avoid sign theft.

==Examples==

===Austria===
*After frequent thefts of its welcome sign at the town boundary, the Austrian village of Fucking installed theft-resistant signs in 2005. The town changed its name to Fugging in 2021 after a vote in late 2020.

===France===
*Due to its reliance on right of way laws and traffic lights, the capital city, Paris originally had only a single octagonal stop sign in the entire city, marking an otherwise unremarkable driveway. The sign is believed to have been repeatedly stolen as a souvenir until officials stopped replacing it.

===Canada===
*Ragged Ass Road in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada saw such frequent sign thefts that the city welded the sign to the post and began to sell replica street signs.
*De Grassi Street in Toronto has seen multiple sign thefts over the years because of its connection to the &quot;Degrassi&quot; teen television franchise. According to the Globe and Mail, twelve signs were stolen in 2000 alone.
*Street signs in the University District of Kingston, Ontario see frequent sign thefts by students. As many as 30 signs needed replacements at one point.

===Republic of Ireland===
*Signs are often stolen in Ireland for decorating the walls of Irish pubs around the world: places in County Kerry and sites associated with Michael Collins (such as Béal na Bláth or Clonakilty) are especially popular.

===Germany===
*Due to the heavy metal festival that is named after the place, the small hamlet of Wacken in Northern Germany had to deal with street sign theft.

===The Netherlands===

*All the signs of the Dutch village Maaskantje were stolen since the &quot;New Kids&quot; comedy sketch show on Comedy Central (which is situated in the village) became popular (in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany). The municipality of Maaskantje decided not to replace the stolen signs.
*In Amsterdam, signs prohibiting the consumption of cannabis were a frequent target of theft, prompting the city to offer replicas of the sign for sale.

===Spain===
*Leganés, Spain dedicated some streets to rock groups like AC/DC, Scorpions, Iron Maiden and Rosendo. The AC/DC sign was stolen days after inauguration. Leganés authorities now offer identical signs for sale.

===Sweden===

*Sweden&#x27;s distinctive warning sign for moose is noted for its tendency to be stolen, traditionally by German tourists. 
*The sign &quot;Grovare 6&quot;, pointing to the small village Grovare in Sweden, 6 km from the sign, was often stolen. &quot;Grovare&quot; means &quot;rougher&quot; in Swedish with slightly wrong grammar, and the number 6 is spelt &quot;sex&quot;. The new sign says &quot;Grovare 5&quot;, even though it is still 6 km.

===United Kingdom===

*The signs on Abbey Road in London, England were often stolen by Beatles fans until the city council mounted them on buildings.
*Street signs on Butt Hole Road in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire were stolen. The street was renamed Archers Way in 2009.
*The village of Shitterton in Dorset saw its welcome sign stolen so often that in 2007 the local council stopped replacing it. The village&#x27;s residents eventually contributed funds to buy a one-and-a-half-tonne stone slab with the town&#x27;s name engraved on it as a permanent replacement.
*The signs on Dumb Woman&#x27;s Lane, in Udimore, East Sussex, are sometimes stolen.
*Signs to the hamlet of Lost in Aberdeenshire have been repeatedly stolen. To deter theft, the council erected a sign in 2004 which had been welded to the post.

===United States===

* The sign for South Park Street in Lawrence, Kansas has been stolen on several occasions, prompting the city to install theft-proof bolts on the sign.
* In 1988, Denver, Colorado began selling replica Corona Street signs after noting the signs were stolen by fans of the beer.
* Brickyard Road, Lakeside, Florida. Fans repeatedly stole the road sign because Lynyrd Skynyrd lead singer Ronnie Van Zant was living there before his death in 1977 and his brother, Johnny Van Zant, released an album and single called &quot;Brickyard Road&quot; in 1990. The county eventually erected a concrete pillar with the street name painted on it, as opposed to a traditional road sign.
* State, provincial or federal highways in many countries may face sign theft issues if their route number has popular culture connotations. Numbers especially prone to theft include 69 because of its use as a slang term for simultaneous oral sex, 420 because of its connection to marijuana culture, and 666 because of its association with the Biblical Number of the Beast. Five highways numbered 69 in the United States have been renumbered due to sign theft: Route 69 in New Jersey was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967, State Route 69 in Ohio was renumbered to Ohio State Route 235 in 1968, State Highway 69 in Texas was renumbered to State Highway 112 in 1992, State Highway 69 in South Carolina was renumbered to South Carolina Highway 65 in 1981 and State Route 69 in Utah was renumbered to State Route 38 in 1994. In addition, officials in Oregon had originally planned to assign the Route 69 designation to the Beltline Highway in Eugene in 2002 but later chose to assign Oregon Route 569 to the route instead. However, Interstate 69 and US-69 have not been altered. Sign theft was also a factor that led to the renumbering of U.S. Route 666 to U.S. Route 491 in 2003, with a majority of the US 666 signs stolen following the announcement of the renumbering. In addition, County Route 666 in Morris County, New Jersey was renumbered to County Route 665 due to sign theft.
* Signs for mile marker 66.6 on the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway were frequently stolen, prompting officials to consider changing the mile marker to 66.61.
* Signs for mile marker 420 along Interstate 70 in Colorado were often stolen due to the marijuana reference, leading the Colorado Department of Transportation to change the mile marker to 419.99. The states of Washington, Idaho, North Carolina and Florida have also since begun implementing the same solution in response to incidents of &quot;mile 420&quot; sign theft. Idaho replaced mile marker 420 along U.S. Route 95 with 419.9, which is also now used on Interstate 75 in Florida and Interstate 40 in North Carolina.
* Richard Bong State Recreation Area, a state park in Wisconsin, also suffers from sign theft due to the association of the word &quot;bong&quot; with marijuana culture.
* U.S. Route 66 in the United States, the subject of a 1940s pop song, also sees frequent sign theftsigns are so often stolen that in some places it can be difficult to navigate without knowing the route; furthermore, US 66 signage has not been maintained since the route was decommissioned from the U.S. Highway System in 1985. Instead, some localities rely on route shield pavement markings, which cannot be stolen, to indicate the path of the historic route.
* Often in the United States and Canada, the sign for streets called &quot;High St.&quot; are stolen, also for its connection to marijuana culture. In an episode of the TV series &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, several of the characters attempt to steal a High St. sign to give to Steven Hyde for his birthday. This is less common in the United Kingdom, as the term &quot;High Street&quot; is a general term for a town&#x27;s main shopping district, equivalent to Main Street in North America.
* In the southernmost urbanized portion of Anchorage, Alaska, near the Seward Highway, a neighborhood street was called Jackass Lane. The sign at its intersection with Huffman Road, a major thoroughfare in Anchorage, was stolen so frequently during the 1970s and 1980s that the city government renamed the street to Silver Fox Lane.
* Signs leading to Bolinas, California were often stolen or wrongly placed by its reclusive residents as a means to make it difficult for tourists to locate the beachside town.
* The entry sign in Intercourse, Pennsylvania has been stolen or vandalized on more than one occasion.
* In the early 1990s, during the popularity of the movie &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, many signs that said &quot;Bat Cave Fire District&quot; were stolen around the town of Bat Cave, North Carolina. So many signs were taken that the local volunteer fire department stopped putting them back up.
* The sign for Blue Jay Way is said to be the most-stolen street sign in Los Angeles, because of its association with the Beatles song written by George Harrison. The city eventually gave up on a metal sign and painted the street&#x27;s name on the curb.
* Climax and Hell, Michigan see frequent street thefts due to their names.
* Reassurance markers for highway M-22 in Michigan. The highway is nationally popular for its scenery, taking drivers around the Leelanau Peninsula and eastern shore of Lake Michigan. It also runs along the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, named the &quot;Most Beautiful Place in America&quot; by ABC News. A local kiteboarding company also released a line of merchandise with the highway marker on it, branding them as &quot;M-22&quot;. Signs along M-22 have been repeatedly stolen since 2003. The Michigan Department of Transportation has replaced stolen signs without the letter &quot;M&quot; on it.
* To discourage frequent theft of signs for Harry Baals Drive in Fort Wayne, Indiana, replacement signs now read &quot;H. W. Baals Dr&quot;. In 2011, civic leaders also rejected a popular proposal to name a new government building after the former mayor.
* In the small towns of Embden and New Portland, Maine, the sign for a street named Katie Crotch Road has been stolen numerous times. Residents of Embden have voted on the issue of changing the street&#x27;s name to Cadie Road multiple times, including in 2016, where the motion was denied, as it had been in previous years.
* In Cleveland, Ohio the recently renamed &quot;Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Way&quot; sign was stolen shortly after it was installed.
* In 2019, officials in Montgomery County, Maryland attempted to discourage street sign theft by removing the vowels from several frequently stolen signs throughout the county. Affected signs included &quot;Stoner Drive&quot;, &quot;Blunt Road&quot;, &quot;Morningwood Drive&quot;, and &quot;Terrapin Drive&quot;.
* In 2019, seven stop signs were stolen in Washington Township, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="570230" wikidata="Q1933629" url="?curid=570230" title="Selected Ambient Works Volume II">
<text>Selected Ambient Works Volume II (abbreviated as SAW II) is the second studio album by the British electronic music artist and producer Richard D. James under the alias of Aphex Twin. It was released on 7March 1994 through Warp Records. Following James&#x27;s ambient techno debut &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85–92&quot;, &quot;Volume II&quot; features purely ambient music. James was inspired through lucid dreaming and likened the album to &quot;standing in a power station on acid.&quot;

Most of the tracks on &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; were untitled and represented with abstract photographs and pie charts. Fan-named, unofficial titles are still widely used today.

The album received mixed reviews upon release; critics mainly criticised its largely beatless composition and the repetition throughout. The record entered the UK Dance Albums Chart at No.1 and UK Albums Chart at No.11. Retrospective reviews of the album were more positive, and have described its major role in the evolution of ambient music and electronica. In 2016 &quot;Pitchfork&quot; picked &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; as the second greatest ambient album of all time, after Brian Eno&#x27;s &quot;Ambient 1: Music for Airports&quot;. A remastered and expanded reissue of the album was released in October 2024 with two bonus tracks.

== Background ==
Richard D. James, known professionally as Aphex Twin, is an electronic music producer from Cornwall. After his first release, the 1991 acid techno EP &quot;Analogue Bubblebath&quot;, his first studio album, &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85–92&quot;, released to critical acclaim in 1992 with R&amp;S Records. The ambient techno album was a defining factor in the evolution of electronic music and immediately garnered James an underground following. Arriving at the peak of the &quot;house explosion&quot;, the album was in contrast to the era&#x27;s &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot; electronica and &quot;proved that techno could be more than druggy dance music&quot;. James signed with Warp Records, where he released albums such as &quot;Surfing on Sine Waves&quot; under different aliases. He also pursued his own record label, Rephlex Records. James&#x27;s EP, &quot;On&quot;, directly preceded &quot;Volume II&quot; release.

== Recording and composition ==

James&#x27;s enigmatic persona, marked by reticent interviews and outlandish, unverifiable claims, has deepened the mystique around his life and music and blurred facts about his recording process with fiction. James has stated that most of &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; had been recorded in 1993, a year before the album&#x27;s official release, in his London and Cornwall home studios. The track &quot;Blue Calx&quot; was recorded sometime between 1988 and 1990; James has said that it was the last he recorded in his older Cornwall home studio at his parents&#x27; house, during a visit back from his studies at Cornwall College. His North London home studio, built in 1993, contained a variety of old EMS, Moog, ARP, and Oberheim Matrix synthesizers. James once specified that track 23 (&quot;Tassels&quot;) had been recorded with an EMS Synthi A Mk1 and a Studiomaster Star System. A Yamaha CS-5 was also used in the recording of the album, and was later auctioned with the album&#x27;s liner notes inscribed.

&quot;Volume II&quot; differs significantly from &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85–92&quot;. Rather than featuring tracks driven by ambient techno and soft breakbeats, &quot;Volume II&quot; features both quiet and minimal compositions and &quot;chilly&quot; textured soundscapes that have been described as &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;forboding&quot; and &quot;empty&quot;. The album makes liberal use of microtonal musical tunings, an interest of James&#x27;s at the time.

James credited the album to his lucid dreaming. He said upon waking from sleep in his studio, he would attempt to recreate and record the sounds, though he struggled to fully replicate them. James compared the album with &quot;standing in a power station on acid&quot;, feeling the hum and dreamlike presence of the surrounding electricity.

Simon Reynolds commented that, on &quot;Volume II&quot;, James changed styles &quot;from the idyllic, Satie-esque naïveté of early tracks like &#x27;Analogue Bubblebath&#x27; to clammy, foreboding sound-paintings.&quot; Reynolds stated that, along with other artists such as Seefeel, David Toop and Max Eastley, James had moved from &quot;rave&quot; into the vicinity of isolationism&quot;, a term coined by Kevin Martin to label music that &quot;breaks with all of ambient&#x27;s feel-good premises. Isolationism is ice-olationist, offering cold comfort. Instead of pseudopastoral peace, it evokes an uneasy silence: the uncanny calm before catastrophe, the deathly quiet of aftermath.&quot; Critics elsewhere have referred to the record as dark ambient, as well as drone.

Writer Mark J. Prendergast discussed &quot;Volume II&quot; for his 2000 book &quot;The Ambient Century&quot;. Prendergast noted how the general effect of the album on the listener was one that &quot;evoked a sense of awe&quot;. Prendergast described the overall composition of &quot;Volume II&quot; as &quot;waking dreams, replete with muffled cooing voices and phantom rhythms&quot;. He commented on a variety of tracks of &quot;Volume II&quot;. Track 3 (&quot;Rhubarb&quot;) was described as one that emerged from a &quot;dense fog&quot;. Track 5 (&quot;Grass&quot;) was highlighted for its &quot;slow, tribal&quot; beat; Prendergast also noted it had a &quot;kind of discreet Soviet atmosphere&quot;. Track 17 (&quot;Z Twig&quot;) contained &quot;keyboard splashes set to various sound frequencies&quot; that Prendergast described as &quot;lovely&quot;.

In a later discussion about the album, Dan Carr of &quot;Reverb&quot; called the composition of track 3 (&quot;Rhubarb&quot;) a &quot;rhythmically shapeless piece&quot; which is based around a &quot;beautiful-sounding chord progression that is repeated throughout the entire song&quot;. Carlos Hawthorn writing for &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; noted the chilling atmosphere of track 22 (&quot;Spots&quot;), which featured a sample taken from a stolen police interview tape with a woman who had murdered her husband. In a piece for &quot;The Quietus&quot;, John Doran noted how track 8 (&quot;Blur&quot;) and track 9 (&quot;Weathered Stone&quot;) featured a &quot;quantized pulse&quot;. A retrospective review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described track 16 (&quot;Grey Stripe&quot;) as &quot;pure filtered white noise&quot;, like &quot;the dying breath of a distant star&quot;. Track 19 (&quot;Stone in Focus&quot;) is a slow track that contains a ticking metronome and a &quot;slow swell&quot; fading in and out.

==Artwork==

The artwork for the album was designed by Paul Nicholson, who was credited as Prototype 21 in the liner notes.

Most of the tracks on &quot;Volume II&quot; were not given official titles; rather, each track was instead represented by a photograph in the album&#x27;s artwork. Nicholson stated in an interview with &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; that the photographs were taken by James&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, known only as &quot;Sam&quot;, and that most of the photographs were taken in a flat that all three were living in together. According to James, the reason for tracks remaining untitled was due to his synesthesia. Rather than trying to affix tracks with titles, James would opt to identify each composition with colour instead; this was reflected within the artwork.

While most of the tracks were officially untitled, unofficial titles created by fan Greg Eden were adapted and are widely used today. These fan titles were derived from the photography seen throughout the record. Eden simply &quot;wrote what the pictures looked like&quot; with little hesitation, i.e., all within a few minutes, and no additional contemplation. Eden would later go on to work for Warp Records in 1995, before leaving in 2005.

The front cover of &quot;Volume II&quot; was the result of James scratching the Aphex Twin logo onto the back of a leather travel case using a razor and a compass, which Sam photographed. Nicholson said that the pie charts and size of the photographs that represented each track in the artwork corresponded to their duration. The timecodes of a track would be converted into a decimal, then into the percentage of the total length of the side of the record the track is on, and then into a degree to be used on the pie chart.

Discussing the artwork for &quot;Bandcamp Daily&quot;, Andy Beta described the cover of the album as unfamiliar and alien, and compared the sepia tones seen within the cover art to it being affected by solar radiation exposure. Beta described the blurry and unfocused nature of the photography and compared the pictures to them being taken on a &quot;distant planet&quot;. Philip Sherburne of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the logo on the cover a relic from &quot;some strange future-past&quot;, and compared the cover to markings that had been &quot;discovered on some weathered desert pyramid&quot;. He also discussed the mysterious nature of the photography seen throughout the album.

==Release==
Warp released &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; on double CD, double cassette and triple LP on 7 March 1994 in the United Kingdom, followed by 12 April on double CD through Sire in Australia, Japan and the United States. The 19th track is omitted from all versions of the original release&#x27;s CD pressings due to space limitations. It entered the &#x27;s Dance Albums Chart at No.1 and remained in the top five for six weeks. It entered the Albums Chart at No.11. By July 1994 the album had sold more than 60,000 copies outside the United States.

Before its release on &quot;Volume II&quot;, the track &quot;Blue Calx&quot; had been featured on a 1992 compilation titled &quot;The Philosophy of Sound and Machine&quot;, published by Rephlex Records. An original version of track 2 (&quot;Radiator&quot;) with added percussion was released as a part of &quot;26 Mixes for Cash&quot;, under the title of &quot;SAW2 CD1 TRK2, Original Mix&quot;. The track was later officially named &quot;Radiator (Original Mix)&quot; within &quot;Peel Session 2&quot;.

On 6 March 2012 &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; was reissued on vinyl by record label 1972 Records. The master for this release was made from a US CD copy however, which omitted both the 4th and 19th tracks. James added the album to his own web store in 2017 with a 26th track, &quot;th1 [evnslower]&quot;, and the 19th track, which was its first digital availability since its inclusion on the 1994 ambient music CD compilation &quot;Excursions in Ambience: The Third Dimension&quot;.

===Expanded edition===
In June 2024, Warp announced an expanded edition of the album on digital, triple CD, 4xLP and double cassette formats, remastered by Matt Colton. A 4xLP deluxe boxset came in a hinged oak case topped with an etched copper plate and accompanied by a booklet of design sketches. The cassettes were originally released as type II chrome cassettes, which were limited to 250 total copies.

In September 2024, James released &quot;th1 [evnslower]&quot; for streaming platforms. It had previously appeared in James&#x27;s SoundCloud archive in 2015. The composition of &quot;th1 [evnslower]&quot; was described as both slow and dark. On the same day of the release, Warp Records and James announced that listening parties for &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II (Expanded Edition)&quot; would take place at record shops across the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Ireland. After the success of the chrome cassettes, Warp began production of a cassette variant made with ferric tape instead. In October 2024, James released the single &quot;#3 / Rhubarb Orc. 19.53 Rev&quot; onto streaming platforms.

On 4 October 2024, &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II (Expanded Edition)&quot; was officially released and included both bonus tracks and the previously excluded 19th track. James dedicated the re-release to his mother, Lorna, who had died in 2022. Another listening party took place at the Tate Modern in late October.

==Reception==
&quot;Volume II&quot; received mixed reviews from critics upon release. &quot;Spin&quot; gave the album a positive review, with critic Simon Reynolds acknowledging the album&#x27;s &quot;euphoric&quot; and &quot;majestically melancholy&quot; tracks, but also describing the album&#x27;s eerie aspect and that it could leave listeners &quot;spooked out&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Jon Wiederhorn wrote about how artists similar to James in sound had been producing music that lacked emotion akin to elevator music, while James was able to use the ambient genre to explore &quot;spooky, textured sound&quot; and to confront his &quot;shadowy demons&quot;. Wiederhorn concluded that the album played a significant part in the evolution of ambient electronic music. Clark Collis of &quot;Select&quot; pointed out how listeners expecting an album in the style of &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85–92&quot; would be surprised due to &quot;Volume II&quot;&#x27;s beatless structure. Collis noted the album did not give into typical conventions of electronica, but worked well as an ambient album and was a record that required attention from the listener.

Other reviews were less favourable. Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, negatively expressed how James&#x27;s music was incomparable to that of Brian Eno, Jon Hassell or Harold Budd and commented on the lack of richness in &quot;Volume II&quot;&#x27;s composition. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic Charles Aaron stated that &quot;Volume II&quot; resembled an avant-garde soundtrack to a &quot;postapocalyptic&quot; piece of theater, similar to the compositions of Philip Glass. However, Aaron also wrote about how the album often times contained &quot;chamber music for humorless cyber-nerds&quot;.

&quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; was discussed by David Toop in 1995&#x27;s &quot;Ocean of Sound: Aether Talk, Ambient Sound and Imaginary Worlds&quot;. Toop called the album a &quot;serene, disembodied, episodic collection&quot;, and compared the album to an auditory equivalent of &quot;a photo album filled with Polaroids of sunsets and seascapes&quot;. Mark Prendergast&#x27;s &quot;The Ambient Century&quot; on the history of ambient music, said that &quot;Volume II&quot; managed to remain enjoyable and exciting throughout.

==Legacy==
===Retrospective reviews===

At the end of the decade &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; was included on several publications&#x27; lists of top albums of the 1990s, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot;. Hyperreal.org, a rave culture site which hosted an influential IDM mailing list, conducted polls that ranked the all-time ambient records; &quot;Volume II&quot; was placed as the first in 1996, and the second in 2001. Commenting on the audience&#x27;s reaction of the album in 1999, Simon Reynolds stated that many fans of James were confused by &quot;Volume II&quot;, and that fans continually divided in discussion about the album. David Fricke, Rob Sheffield, and Ann Powers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that James had created a perfect soundtrack for recuperating after a loud night at a club, and that it was a dance album that focused on rhythm within one&#x27;s head. Within the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;, Simon Reynolds gave &quot;Volume II&quot; a positive review, acknowledging that while the album wasn&#x27;t as engaging as &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85–92&quot;, it was still as impressive. Reynolds also stated that the tracks within &quot;Volume II&quot; had a &quot;petrified and petrifying beauty&quot;. Philip Sherburne of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album a 10/10, discussing the album&#x27;s long-term influence on electronica and stating how it &quot;changed ambient music forever&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; gave the album 4/5 stars, discussing how James doubled down on his enigmatic persona with the release of &quot;Volume II&quot;.

&quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; both placed the album in their lists of the 1990s best albums; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Volume II&quot; at number 62, while &quot;Spin&quot; placed &quot;Volume II&quot; and its previous volume both at number 56, calling it &quot;an awe-inspiring feat of avant-techno texturology&quot;. Alex Linhardt of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; discussed how &quot;Volume II&quot; was responsible for one of the great trajectories of pop music in the 1990s, influencing the sound of artists such as Radiohead, notably for their album &quot;Kid A&quot;, and Timbaland. It was later ranked second on the website&#x27;s 2016 list of the best ambient music albums, after Brian Eno&#x27;s &quot;Ambient 1: Music for Airports&quot;. Carlos Hawthorn of &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; gave the album a 5/5 for its 25th anniversary, writing that &quot;Volume II&quot; created atmospheres made up of vivid textures and sounds.

Critics such as Tom Hull and Sasha Frere-Jones criticised the repetitive nature of the composition of tracks within the album. Frere-Jones wrote about how the album could be beautiful at points, but was generally repetitive throughout. In a biography discussing James in the 2001 edition of the &quot;All Music Guide to Electronica&quot;, John Bush referred to the album multiple times as a &quot;joke on the electronic community&quot; due to its minimal composition and its difference in sound from &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85–92&quot; and &quot;On&quot;. In the same guide, reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote about the album&#x27;s mysterious and difficult nature for most listeners, while also stating that many would find it fascinating. Marc Weidenbaum discussed how there were continued rumours of &quot;Volume II&quot; being a joke or prank, and that it was used supposedly to exploit the popularity of &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85–92&quot;.

===Influence===
Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted that &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot; was &quot;a very early example of a record being anticipated, experienced, and, ultimately, analyzed in minute detail through online communication.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted that the electronic mailing list titled IDM had a profound influence on how the album would be received in the future, noting the community&#x27;s influence in relation to the album&#x27;s mysterious non-titles. Weidenbaum noted how the fan titles coined by Greg Eden still see mass use today, with the titles being used within the iTunes store listening for &quot;Volume II&quot; and being used throughout publications and James&#x27;s fanbase. Simon Reynolds wrote that the album signalled a shift in techno and ambient music toward a darker sound reminiscent of Brian Eno&#x27;s notion of &quot;environmental music&quot;.

Track 19, unofficially titled &quot;Stone in Focus&quot;, became one of the most best known tracks from &quot;Volume II&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the track halfway among James&#x27;s 20 best songs. Geeta Dayal noted how a YouTube upload of the track had gained a large number of views, as well as thousands of comments that discussed &quot;everything from the vastness of the universe to monoliths and existential despair&quot;. &quot;Fact&quot; ranked the track at 41 in a list of the 50 best songs by James, calling it one of the &quot;most disarming and memorable tracks&quot; from &quot;Volume II&quot;.

Music from &quot;Volume II&quot; has been used in various pieces of media, such as in the 2002 documentary film, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Playground&quot;. Tracks such as &quot;Cliffs&quot; were used for the intro and outro of the documentary. Reid W. Dunn, known by the alias Wisp, released a selection of remixes of tracks from &quot;Volume II&quot; in 2004 for the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary. Weidenbaum discussed how the composition of the &quot;Cliffs&quot; mix in particular was enhanced by &quot;the clanking of what seems to be a manual typewriter&quot;. In 2008, the orchestra Alarm Will Sound released a live performance album, &quot;&quot;, featuring two tracks from &quot;Volume II&quot;: &quot;Blue Calx&quot; and &quot;Cliffs&quot;.

James drifted from ambient music after &quot;Volume II&quot; with his subsequent EP &quot;Ventolin&quot; and other releases. One critic likened James&#x27;s following album, &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot;, to an &quot;industrial scream&quot; against the &quot;pastoral whisper&quot; of &quot;Volume II&quot;.

<doc id="570231" wikidata="Q200432" url="?curid=570231" title="Godzilla vs. Hedorah">
<text>is a 1971 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed and co-written by Yoshimitsu Banno, with special effects by Teruyoshi Nakano. Produced and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd., it is the 11th film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise and Banno&#x27;s directorial debut. The ensemble cast includes , , , , and , with Haruo Nakajima as Godzilla and Kenpachiro Satsuma as Hedorah. The film features an environmentalist message as symbolized by Hedorah being spawned from pollution. It was released in the United States as Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster.

Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka offered Banno the opportunity to direct a &quot;Godzilla&quot; film shortly after working together on the Mitsubishi Pavilion at Expo &#x27;70. Franchise veterans Kaoru Mabuchi and Ishirō Honda were tasked with assisting Banno with scripting and directing the film respectively. Tanaka was hospitalized for the majority of the production, and Banno took advantage of this to include a scene he thought Tanaka would have otherwise rejected. Principal photography took 35 days with a crew of around 50 on an estimated budget.

&quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; was distributed in Japan on July 24, 1971, as part of the Toho Champion Festival. It was a moderate box office success, grossing , and largely ignored by Japanese critics. The few contemporary reviews were generally unfavorable and conflicted about the scene where Godzilla uses his atomic breath to fly.

&quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; is now considered a cult classic and has often been described as the most &quot;unique&quot; film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. Retrospective critical reviews have been mixed to positive. Roger Ebert, Adam Wingard, and Nicolas Cage have hailed the film as their favorite in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series. Banno proposed numerous follow-ups until he died in 2017. Although none of his submissions have ever come to fruition, one ultimately led to the production of &quot;Godzilla&quot; (2014), for which he served as an executive producer. A short based on the film premiered at Godzilla Fest 2021 in celebration of the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

The film was followed by Jun Fukuda&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot;, released on March 12, 1972,

==Plot==
Hedorah, an amorphous species of alien from the Horsehead Nebula, is transported to Earth by a comet. Upon arrival, it feeds on Earth&#x27;s pollution and grows into a poisonous, acid-secreting sea monster. After it sinks an oil tanker and attacks Dr. Toru Yano and his young son Ken, scarring the doctor, Hedorah&#x27;s toxic existence is revealed to the public. Ken has visions of Godzilla fighting the world&#x27;s pollution and insists Godzilla will come to mankind&#x27;s aid against Hedorah.

Hedorah metamorphoses into an amphibious form, allowing it to move onto land to feed on additional sources of pollution. The alien makes its way to a power station where it begins consuming the smoke from its chimneys, but is confronted by Godzilla. Hedorah is easily overpowered by Godzilla and retreats into the sea. During the fight, however, several pieces of its new body are flung nearby, which then crawl back into the sea to grow anew and allow the monster to become even more powerful. It returns shortly afterward in a flying saucer-like shape, then assuming its strongest form of all, its &quot;Perfect Form&quot;, which demonstrates some of the strongest powers it has access to yet.

Thousands of people across Japan die in Hedorah&#x27;s raids. As hope sinks, a party is thrown on Mount Fuji to celebrate one last day of life before the country—and then, the rest of the world—succumbs to Hedorah. Ken, Yukio Keuchi, Miki Fujinomiya, and the other partygoers realize that Godzilla and Hedorah have also come to Mount Fuji for a decisive confrontation. During the battle, Godzilla fights valiantly against Hedorah but is outmatched by Hedorah&#x27;s impressive durability and fearsome strength, losing an eye and sustaining a full thickness chemical burn to a hand - right down to the bone - by Hedorah&#x27;s acidic body, which corrodes anything that comes into contact with it. Finally, Godzilla is almost killed by Hedorah after Hedorah hurls Godzilla into a giant pit, then proceeds to attempt to drown Godzilla in a deluge of chemical sludge.

Dr. Toru and his wife Toshie have determined that drying out Hedorah&#x27;s body may destroy the otherwise unkillable monster. While Godzilla and Hedorah fought, the JSDF swiftly constructed two gigantic electrodes for this purpose and attempted to fire them, giving Godzilla the chance to return to the fight.

Suddenly, the electrodes short out, the power cut off by Godzilla and Hedorah&#x27;s violent battle. Godzilla reactivates and energizes the electrodes with its atomic heat ray, dehydrating Hedorah&#x27;s outer body. Hedorah sheds this outer body and takes flight to escape, but Godzilla propels itself through the air with its atomic heat ray to give chase. Godzilla drags Hedorah back to the electrodes and continues to dehydrate it until Hedorah is on the brink of defeat. Godzilla tears open Hedorah&#x27;s dried-out body and exposes it to the electrodes again, dehydrating the pieces until nothing remains but dust. Godzilla returns to the sea, but not before pausing to gaze sternly at the surviving humans. Ken Yano bids goodbye to Godzilla.

Assistant director Kōichi Kawakita makes an uncredited cameo appearance as a bar customer.

==Production==
=== Development ===
Producer Tomoyuki Tanaka offered Banno the opportunity to direct a &quot;Godzilla&quot; film shortly after working together on the Mitsubishi Pavilion at Expo &#x27;70. Due to Banno&#x27;s inexperience, franchise veterans Kaoru Mabuchi and Ishirō Honda were tasked with assisting him with scripting and directing the film respectively. Tanaka&#x27;s declining health led to him being hospitilized for the majority of production, and Banno took advatuge of this to include a scene where Godzilla chases Hedorah by using his atomic breath to fly, which reportedly resulted in Tanaka loathing the film and refusing to give Banno another chance to direct a Godzilla film.

Director Banno initially conceived the idea for &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; after seeing cities like Yokkaichi covered in black smog and the ocean filled with foam from dumped detergent and formulated the story of an alien tadpole transforming into a monster as a result of the pollution.

=== Filming and special effects ===
The film marked director Banno&#x27;s directorial debut; however, the budget for &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; was significantly lower than previous &quot;Godzilla&quot; films. Banno was only given 35 days to shoot the film and only had one team available to shoot both the drama and monster effects scenes. Veteran Godzilla director Ishirō Honda was later tasked by producer Tomoyuki Tanaka to watch Banno&#x27;s rough cut and provide advice.

Teruyoshi Nakano provided the special effects for the film and worked alongside Banno in order to make a film that spoke about the dangers of environmental pollution in the same way the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; addressed the threat of nuclear weapons. Nakano and Banno often differed on how they should approach the movie with Nakano favored a tone and approach similar to the original &quot;Godzilla&quot;, while Banno wanted to make a film more directed towards children. The original script didn&#x27;t feature Godzilla flying, but Banno wanted something &quot;extraordinary&quot; for the film. Nakano reluctantly added in the sequence, saying later in life he felt it was mistake in doing so. In order to alleviate the bleak tone several comedic scenes were added by Nakano.

Kenpachiro Satsuma, the actor who played Hedorah, was struck with appendicitis shortly after production as he was giving a publicity interview to a newspaper while only loosely wearing the heavy Hedorah costume. He had to be rushed off to surgery. During the appendectomy, Satsuma learned that painkillers had no effect on him.

Director Yoshimitsu Banno was going to make a sequel to this film, but it was scrapped due to the fact that Tomoyuki Tanaka reportedly hated &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;, so he fired Yoshimitsu Banno. The next film was going to be called &quot;Godzilla vs. Redmoon&quot;, but this was scrapped and later became &quot;Daigoro vs. Goliath&quot;, then they planned a new film called &quot;Godzilla vs. The Space Monsters: Earth Defensive Directive&quot;, but this was also scrapped and then became &quot;The Return of King Ghidorah&quot;, which was also scrapped, after which they ultimately made &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot;.

The film also includes animated sequences, which were intended to convey the environmental message. 

&quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; features a relatively uncelebrated cast, as requested by Banno.

==Release==
&quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; was a moderate box office success in Japan, where it grossed . In 2019, to celebrate the lives of Banno and Nakajima (both of whom died in 2017), it was the 22 film screened as part of the National Film Archive of Japan&#x27;s &quot;In Memory of Film Figures We Lost in 2017-2018&quot; event.

The film was released in February 1972 by American International Pictures under the title &quot;Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster&quot;. There were several small alterations: dialogue was dubbed into English by Titan Productions, several shots with Japanese text were replaced with English or textless equivalents, additional sound effects and Foley were added to some scenes, and the song &quot;Save the Earth&quot; (based on &quot;Give Back the Sun!&quot;, a song in the original Japanese version of the film) was added. This version was rated &#x27;G&#x27; by the MPAA, and the same version was given an &#x27;A&#x27; certificate by the BBFC for its UK theatrical release in 1975.

The AIP version has been replaced in the North American home video and television markets (including Sony&#x27;s DVD and Kraken Releasing&#x27;s DVD and Blu-ray) by Toho&#x27;s international version, titled &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;. This version features the original English dub produced in Hong Kong and by extension lacks the English-language song &quot;Save the Earth&quot;. This version was first broadcast in the United States by the Sci-Fi Channel on January 20, 1996.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS by Orion Pictures in 1989 and on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on October 19, 2004. The film received another DVD release and a Blu-ray release by Kraken Releasing on May 6, 2014. A video transfer of &quot;Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster&quot; was released in Canada on DVD packaged with &quot;Godzilla vs. Megalon&quot; by Digital Disc. In 2019, the Japanese version was included in a Blu-ray box set released by the Criterion Collection, which included all 15 films from the franchise&#x27;s Shōwa era.

In 2021, Toho premiered a 4K remaster of the film on the Nippon Classic Movie Channel, along with seven other Godzilla films also remastered in 4K. The film was downscaled to 2K for broadcast. UHD and bluray discs of this remaster are scheduled for release in Japan on December 20, 2023.

== Reception ==

=== Contemporaneous ===
According to Banno, Japanese critics generally ignored &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;, but those who did review it unanimously panned it, with the exception of the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;. Nakano described initial responses as polarized, with divisive notices from newspapers and mixed reviews from magazines. Later publications noted how reviewers conflicted about the scene where Godzilla uses his atomic breath to fly, although Nakano claimed that it was praised in the United States.

In July 1972, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as the &quot;most blatant of all of the pollution pictures&quot;. He felt viewers would not be inclined to protest against pollution after watching the movie, and opposed this notation. Alan Cookman of the &quot;Evening Sentinel&quot; called the film a &quot;curious—and curiously fascinating—Japanese import [that] is more of a tongue-in-cheek effort than you might imagine&quot;, venturing that six-to-twelve-year-olds would likely enjoy it most. He added that, &quot;With wide screen, good colour and effects which include occasional lapses into animation and splitscreen, it is technically quite impressive. Twenty years ago I would have lapped it up.&quot;

The film was featured in the 1978 book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot; by Harry Medved with Randy Dreyfuss. The book quoted a few Western reviews of the film, including Leonard Maltin calling it &quot;dubbed and daffy&quot;; the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; panning it; and &quot;The Monster Times&quot; saying it was &quot;one of the worst monster films ever; an idiotic kiddie show!&quot;

=== Retrospective ===
&quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; has received mixed—mostly positive—retrospective reviews. 

In 1998, a reviewer for &quot;Stomp Tokyo&quot; wrote that the film has &quot;many obvious, crippling flaws&quot; but praised the monster action, and commended the lack of reliance on stock footage and the effort put into the animated segments. In 2004, Stuart Galbraith IV, writing for DVD Talk, stated that the film &quot;earns points for trying something new, to break away from what was fast becoming a tired formula. The film isn&#x27;t as entertaining as &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; or &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla&quot;, but it is more original and daring, and ... fans will want to pick [it] up.&quot;

In their 2018 book &quot;Japan&#x27;s Green Monsters&quot;, Sean Rhoads and Brooke McCorkle offer an ecocritical assessment of &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;. The scholars argue that viewing &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; through three lenses—those being Japanese environmental history, the monster movie genre, and the historical trends that crippled the Japanese film industry—provides a new understanding of the film and Banno&#x27;s intentions. Rhoads and McCorkle specifically counter prior poor reviews of the film like those proffered by Medved and Galbraith, and argue that &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; possesses deeper environmental appeals than the obvious ones present on the film&#x27;s surface.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, in his review panning &quot;Godzilla 1985&quot;, cited &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; as his favorite &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie.

In a December 1996 interview with Cinefantastique, Nakano, the effects artist for the film, stated his thoughts on &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;:&quot;Looking back, the movie seems kind of cruel and heavy handed. I was trying to show the serious threat of pollution with scenes of Godzilla&#x27;s eyes being burned and people dying. I guess I became uncomfortable with it even while we were filming, that’s why we added the comical scenes.&quot;

==Legacy==
After director Yoshimitsu Banno finished directing &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;, he began work on creating another installment in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series. Like his first &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie, Banno had wanted the next film to have a strong message against pollution. The initial idea was that a mutant starfish-like monster battles Godzilla. However, he scrapped this idea and wrote what was going to be &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah 2&quot;. In it, Godzilla was to fight another Hedorah, this time in Africa. Due to Tomoyuki Tanaka&#x27;s reaction to Banno&#x27;s first &quot;Godzilla&quot; film, this was never realized.

Banno spent several years trying to acquire funding for a 40-minute IMAX 3D &quot;Godzilla&quot; film starring a new version of Hedorah called Deathla. The project was tentatively titled &quot;Godzilla 3D: To The Max&quot;. The project was eventually scrapped but several members of the production team, including Banno, would work on the 2014 &quot;Godzilla.&quot; In November 2013, Banno stated that he still hoped to make a sequel to &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah,&quot; but died in 2017. He also served as an executive producer of &quot;&quot; (2019) and &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot; (2021), both of which were released after his death.

==Cancelled sequel==

Yoshimitsu Banno was so pleased with &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot; that he started writing another &quot;Godzilla&quot; film. Banno began preparing a script for &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah 2&quot;. However, Tomoyuki Tanaka, who was hospitalized during the production of &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;, was extremely dissatisfied with the final product and went as far as to tell Banno that he had &quot;ruined Godzilla.&quot; Tanaka prevented Banno from directing another Toho film afterwards and demoted him from director to producer on several upcoming films.

According to Banno though, from later interviews conducted with him, &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah 2&quot; was actually still being worked on after he was removed from the project. Whether the film was going to keep its Africa setting at this stage is not known. The project was eventually scrapped and three more proposed projects would be introduced that following year before finally settling on &quot;Godzilla vs. Gigan&quot; (1972). In a 2014 interview, Banno stated that he read a Godzilla film history book from the US and that he was surprised to read that the next film would take place in Africa and that Tanaka had said that he had banned him from his director position.

A single remnant of Banno&#x27;s intentions to produce a sequel exists in the finished film. At the end of the film, a cliffhanger sequence features an illustration of Hedorah&#x27;s tadpole form, followed by a black screen with red text stating &quot;And yet another one?&quot;, suggesting that Banno was in the process of preparing, or had already prepared a sequel premise for approval.

<doc id="570233" wikidata="Q6432856" url="?curid=570233" title="London School Board">
<text>The School Board for London, commonly known as the London School Board (LSB), was an institution of local government and the first directly elected body covering the whole of London.

The Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75) was the first to provide for education for the whole population of England and Wales. It created elected school boards, which had power to build and run elementary schools where there were insufficient voluntary school places; they could also compel attendance. In most places, the school boards were based on borough districts or civil parishes, but in London the board covered the whole area of the Metropolitan Board of Works – the area today known as Inner London.

Between 1870 and 1904, the LSB was the single largest educational provider in London and the infrastructure and policies it developed were an important influence on London schooling long after the body was abolished.

==School board members==

The entire board was elected every three years, with the first elections held in November 1870. The LSB originally consisted of forty-nine members elected from ten divisions, based around London&#x27;s constituencies or the Districts formed under the Metropolis Management Act 1855. Four divisions, representing the City, Southwark, Chelsea and Greenwich returned four members each. The divisions of Lambeth, Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Westminster returned five members each. Finally, Finsbury and Marylebone returned six and seven members respectively. The membership increased over time: to 50 in 1876 when Lambeth was given an extra member, to 51 in 1882 when the representation of Chelsea increased to five members and to 55 in 1885 when Lambeth was sub-divided into two smaller divisions: Lambeth East and Lambeth West with four and six members respectively.

The electoral system of the LSB contained several innovations. Firstly, the board&#x27;s election of 1870 was polled by secret ballot, being the first large-scale election to use this approach in Britain. Secondly, the cumulative voting system gave electors a number of votes equal to the number of seats in the division in which they were voting. The elector could use up as many of their votes on a single candidate as they wished, which meant that minority interests often found representation.

The LSB, at the time of its creation had one of the broadest mandates of any elected body in Britain. Unusually, women were permitted to vote on the same terms as men for the school boards and also to stand for election. Three women stood in the first board election in 1870: Elizabeth Garrett, who topped the poll, Emily Davies, who also won election, and Maria Georgina Grey. When the second elections were held, in 1873, Garrett and Davies stood down, to be replaced by Jane Agnes Chessar and Alice Cowell, while in 1876, Florence Fenwick Miller, Elizabeth Surr, Helen Taylor and Alice Westlake all won election.

One measure of the LSB&#x27;s importance can be seen in the number of notable figures who stood for election to the board. The board attracted a number of the leading figures of the day, including the scientist Thomas Huxley, Helen Taylor, stepdaughter of John Stuart Mill, and Lord Lawrence, who served as the LSB&#x27;s first chairman. The board was also responsible for launching a number of political careers, including those of Charles Reed, Benjamin Waugh, and the Conservative cabinet minister, William Henry Smith.

==Work of the school board==

The original intention of the board was to provide a sufficient number of school places for the poorest children in London, which were originally estimated at little more than 100,000. The policy adopted by the LSB was to provide London with modern, high-quality schools, whilst compelling parents, by law, to educate their children. Although education would not be compulsory on a national level until 1880, the board passed a by-law in 1871 that compelled parents to have their children schooled between the ages of five and thirteen.

The LSB was largely successful in their aims and often struggled to keep up with the demand for their services. For instance, by the end of the 1880s, the board was providing school places for more than 350,000 children. This growth was frequently attributed to the quality of school premises, which were often far superior to those of private or charity schools. 

The board was responsible for constructing over four hundred schools across London. An important figure in this process was Edward Robert Robson, the board&#x27;s first chief architect. Robson was responsible for designing many of the school buildings erected by the board. The board&#x27;s policy was to construct schools which would be attractive, and would serve to improve the general appearance of the districts in which they were constructed. Although school board architecture drew a considerable amount of criticism at the time, the schools were often sturdy and practical structures, and many schools constructed during this period are still in use.

==Abolition of the board==

Although the school boards had been largely successful in increasing the number of children attending school in Britain, they were perceived as bureaucratic and expensive. As a response to this, the boards were abolished by the Education Act 1902, which replaced them with local education authorities.

In London, the London County Council had been created in 1889 to replace the Metropolitan Board of Works and in 1904 the responsibility for education in London was transferred to the LCC. The LSB held its final meeting on 28 April 1904, with the county council taking over on 1 May. The LCC itself was abolished in 1965, with education for the former School Board area passing to the Inner London Education Authority, a committee of the Greater London Council. The ILEA was abolished in 1990, with the inner London borough councils becoming education authorities.

<text>Bertrand Lucien Bruno Cantat (, ; born 5 March 1964) is a French songwriter, singer, and convicted murderer known for being the former frontman of the rock band Noir Désir. In 2003, he was proven guilty without a doubt and convicted of the murder (&quot;murder with indirect intent&quot; &quot;dolus eventualis&quot;) of French actress Marie Trintignant, which occurred in a hotel room in Vilnius. To some controversy, Cantat returned to Noir Désir after his release from prison in 2007, playing with the group until it disbanded in 2010. He subsequently formed a musical duo with Pascal Humbert, calling themselves Détroit.

==Early life==
Cantat was born in Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques. The son of a navy officer, he spent his childhood in Le Havre. His family moved when he was an adolescent to Bordeaux. At the lycée Saint-Genès, he met Denis Barthe, Serge Teyssot-Gay, and Frédéric Vidalenc, who soon became members of his band.

==Biography==
At the height of Noir Désir&#x27;s success in the 1990s, Cantat was a prominent figure in French music. Noir Désir is regarded &quot;to have made the history of the French rock scene for three decades&quot;. He was known for the quality of his lyrics, charisma, and live performances, often compared to Jim Morrison of the Doors.

In 1997, Cantat married Krisztina Rády, an art director of Hungarian descent, with whom he had two children; Milo, born in 1998, and Alice, born in 2003.

===Murder and imprisonment, 2003–2007===
In 2003, Cantat began an affair with French actress Marie Trintignant. On 26 July of that year, Cantat and Trintignant got in a fight in a hotel room in Vilnius, Lithuania, following a dispute over a text message. Seven hours later, Trintignant&#x27;s brother called emergency services to the couple&#x27;s Vilnius hotel room, as Trintignant had slipped into a deep coma. She died of swelling to the brain several days later in hospital. The post-mortem examination suggested that Cantat had inflicted 19 blows to Trintignant&#x27;s head, causing irreversible brain damage. In court, Cantat claimed he &quot;slapped&quot; Trintignant four times before putting her to bed. He claimed he had flown into a jealous rage after she received a text message from her husband, Samuel Benchetrit. Trintignant was 41 at the time of her death, and left four young sons. French medical experts at the hearing confirmed Cantat&#x27;s claim regarding the slapping, as well as his claim that he could not tell that Trintignant was dying. His house was burned down in Moustey. His spouse and his two children initially were supposed to be in the house at that time, but were in Bordeaux, instead.

In March 2004, Cantat was sentenced by Vilnius Regional Court under Article 129 of the Lithuanian Criminal Code to eight years in prison for murder, committed with indirect intent (&quot;dolus eventualis&quot;). The verdict was at first appealed by Marie Trintignant&#x27;s family, who believed that her killing warranted a harsher sentence, and later by Cantat, who wanted the higher court to reclassify his crime as manslaughter, and therefore lessen his sentence. Both parties ultimately decided to cancel their appeals, which rendered final the original sentence of eight years. At the request of his lawyers, Cantat was moved from the Lithuanian Lukiškės prison, to a prison near Muret, France, in September 2004. Cantat served four years of his eight-year sentence in prison. According to French law, after half of a prison sentence has been served, a criminal with good behavior can be released to serve the rest of his sentence on parole.

===Release, suicide of former wife and band break up, 2007–2010===
Cantat was released from the French prison on parole in October 2007, after serving half of his sentence. His early release aroused the anger of women&#x27;s rights activists and the victim&#x27;s parents, who had failed to persuade French President Nicolas Sarkozy and French judges to block his early release.

On the night of 10 January 2010, Cantat&#x27;s former wife Krisztina Rády Cantat died by suicide. At the time of her death, Bertrand Cantat was present in the house. She was discovered by their children the following day. Shortly before her death, Rády had complained of mental abuse by Cantat. The physical abuse she complained of on the answering machine is that he threw some objects at her, but she never mentioned that he was assaulting her. According to Cantat, Rády&#x27;s parents had spent a week with him after the suicide. Accused by Yael Mellul, magistrates in Bordeaux investigated Cantat in connection with Rády&#x27;s suicide, but ultimately decided not to press charges.

In October 2010, three months after his probational status of release was lifted and his sentence declared completed, Cantat resumed his musical career with a gig in Bordeaux. His re-entry into the public eye vexed women&#x27;s rights campaigners and victim support groups. On 30 November 2010, Noir Désir announced that it would split up for good. Cantat has continued as a solo musician.

===Since Noir Désir&#x27;s breakup, 2011–present===
====Wajdi Mouawad====
In early 2011, Canadian Lebanese playwright Wajdi Mouawad chose Cantat to sing in his production in Montreal of a Sophocles cycle, entitled &quot;Chœurs&quot;. This sparked public criticism due to Cantat&#x27;s murder conviction. Politicians proposed to ban Cantat&#x27;s entry into the country, as Canada&#x27;s immigration legislation bars from entry anyone convicted abroad of a crime which is punishable in Canada by a maximum term of at least 10 years in prison, until at least five years have passed since the end of the complete sentence handed down. Manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment in Canada. Cantat, who had been sentenced to eight years in jail in Lithuania in 2004, was freed in 2007 after serving half his term.

====&quot;Chœurs&quot;====
In April 2011, the artistic director of Théâtre du Nouveau Monde, Lorraine Pintal, announced that Cantat would not be performing in &quot;Chœurs&quot;. Wajdi Mouawad responded to the controversy by publishing an open letter to his three-year-old daughter Aimee in the newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, in which he argued for Cantat&#x27;s right to full reintegration into society.

In November 2011, Cantat released the album &quot;Chœurs&quot;, composed for Mouawad&#x27;s namesake production with musicians Pascal Humbert, Bernard Falaise, and Alexander MacSween.

====Détroit====
In November 2013 Cantat released the album &quot;Horizons&quot; credited to his duo Détroit with Pascal Humbert on Barclay Records label. The first single, titled &quot;Droit dans le Soleil&quot;, had been released on 30 September 2013.

<text>Fine Gael is the third largest political party in the Oireachtas. The Fine Gael leader appoints a team of TDs and Senators to speak for the party on different issues. When Fine Gael was in opposition, the front bench areas of responsibility broadly corresponded to those of Government ministers. Fine Gael has been in Government since March 2011 and accordingly their front bench consists of the ministerial officeholders. In 2020 a number of non-ministerial office holders were appointed as spokespeople for policy areas where Fine Gael does not have a minister.

==Fine Gael ministers==
On 9 April 2024, six Fine Gael TDs were appointed to the 34th government of Ireland and the government on the nomination of the Taoiseach appointed Fine Gael TD Hildegarde Naughton as a minister of state in attendance at cabinet. On 10 April 2024, the government on the nomination of the Taoiseach appointed 7 further Fine Gael ministers of state.

<doc id="570240" wikidata="Q1534456" url="?curid=570240" title="All Monsters Attack">
<text>is a 1969 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Ishirō Honda, written by Shinichi Sekizawa, and produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka. The film, which was produced and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd, is the tenth film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series, and features the fictional monster characters Godzilla, Minilla, and Gabara. The film stars Tomonori Yazaki, Kenji Sahara, and Hideyo Amamoto, with special effects by Honda and Teruyoshi Nakano, and features Haruo Nakajima as Godzilla, Marchan the Dwarf as Minilla, and Yasuhiko Kakuyuki as Gabara.

&quot;All Monsters Attack&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on December 20, 1969. It received a theatrical release in the United States in 1971 by Maron Films, under the title Godzilla&#x27;s Revenge, on a double bill with the 1967 film &quot;Night of the Big Heat&quot;. It has received generally negative reviews for its tone, characters and extensive use of flashback footage from previous &quot;Godzilla&quot; films; many critics and audience retrospectively consider it to be one of the worst &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, although Honda viewed it as one of his favorites.

The film was followed by the 11th film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, &quot;Godzilla vs. Hedorah&quot;, released on July 24, 1971.

==Plot==
Ichiro Miki is a highly imaginative but lonely latchkey kid growing up in urban and polluted Kawasaki. Every day he comes home to his family&#x27;s empty apartment. His only friends are a toymaker named Shinpei Minami and a young girl named Sachiko. Every day after school, Ichiro is tormented by a gang of bullies led by a child named Sanko Gabara. To escape his loneliness, Ichiro sleeps and dreams about visiting Monster Island. During his visit, he witnesses Godzilla battle three Kamacuras, brutally outpowering the three. Ichiro is then chased by a rogue Kamacuras and falls into a deep cave, but luckily avoids being caught by Kamacuras. Shortly afterwards, Ichiro is rescued from the cave by Minilla. Coincidentally, Ichiro quickly learns that Minilla has bully problems too, as it is bullied by an abusive monster known as Gabara.

Ichiro is then awoken by Shinpei who informs him that his mother must work late again. Ichiro goes out to play, but is then frightened by the bullies and finds and explores an abandoned factory. After finding some souvenirs (tubes, a headset, and a wallet with someone&#x27;s [necessarily the suspect&#x27;s] license), Ichiro leaves the factory after hearing some sirens close by. After Ichiro leaves, two bank robbers who were hiding out in the factory learn that Ichiro has found one of their driver&#x27;s licenses and follow him in order to kidnap him.

Later, after his sukiyaki dinner with Shinpei, Ichiro dreams again and reunites with Minilla. Together they both watch as Godzilla fights Ebirah, Kumonga, a giant condor, and some invading jets. Then in the middle of Godzilla&#x27;s fights, Gabara appears and Minilla is forced to battle it, and after a short and one-sided battle, Minilla runs away in fear. Godzilla returns to train Minilla how to fight and use its own atomic breath. However, Ichiro is woken up this time by the bank robbers and is taken hostage as a means of protection from the authorities.

Out of fear and being watched by the thieves, Ichiro calls for Minilla&#x27;s help and falls asleep again where he witnesses Minilla being beaten up by Gabara again. Finally, Ichiro helps Minilla fight back at Gabara and eventually, Minilla wins, catapulting the bully through the air by a seesaw-like log. Godzilla, who was in the area watching comes to congratulate Minilla for its victory but is ambushed by a vengeful Gabara. Godzilla easily beats down Gabara and sends the bully into retreat, never to bother Minilla again. Now from his experiences in his dreams, Ichiro learns how to face his fears and fight back, gaining the courage to outwit the thieves just in time for the police, called by Shinpei, to arrive and arrest them. The next day, Ichiro stands up to Sanko and his gang and wins, regaining his pride and confidence in the process. He also gains their friendship when he plays a prank on a billboard painter.

==Cast==
==Production==
Despite &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; initially having been planned as the final &quot;Godzilla&quot; film, not long thereafter Toho Studios entered negotiations with Filmation for an animated series based on the property that was intended for air during the 1969-70 television season. Although the deal collapsed, Toho&#x27;s view of Godzilla as a children&#x27;s property would dictate their approach to the series from then onward. Due to the economic situation in Japan at the time as well as a downward trajectory of movie going, Toho desired a new &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie which would be made cheaply, quickly, and be directed as a children&#x27;s fantasy film. The film began production in October 1969 and was released in December of that year. 

Due to production costs, &quot;All Monsters Attack&quot; includes extensive stock footage of &quot;Ebirah, Horror of the Deep&quot;, &quot;Son of Godzilla&quot;, &quot;King Kong Escapes&quot;, and &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot;. The filmmakers also employed the same Godzilla suit used for &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot;. Despite being credited as the film&#x27;s special effects director, Eiji Tsuburaya was not actively involved with the production. Director Ishirō Honda not only directed the drama scenes but the special effects scenes as well, with assistance from Teruyoshi Nakano, who was a first assistant special effects director at the time. Honda would later confirm that Tsuburaya was given credit as the film&#x27;s special effects director &quot;out of respect&quot;, and the reason why Honda took over Tsuburaya&#x27;s duties was due to &quot;budget and time constraints&quot;. A small studio was used for the production, where both the special effects and drama scenes were filmed (usually the two were filmed in separate studios).

==Themes==
&quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; was released at a time where latchkey kids had become a rising social issue during the 1960s. Due to rising costs housing costs necessitating women taking jobs outside the home and a lack of widely available after school care, many children were often left to their own devices including dealing with bullies. Paralleling the situation of main character Ichiro, the anthropomorphized Minilla deals with his own bully in the form of the monster Gabara. It is likely that screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa created Gabara&#x27;s name (originally spelled &quot;Gebara&quot;) either from Che Guevara or the German word &quot;gewalt&quot;, meaning violence, as both were prevalent motifs among student protesters of the time.

==Release==

&quot;All Monsters Attack&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on 20 December 1969 where it was distributed by Toho. The film was the first &quot;Toho Champion Matsuri&quot;, a festival-style program that included shorts and feature films.

The film had been test-screened under the title &quot;Minya, Son of Godzilla&quot; in the United States. The version was edited further and released with an English-language dubbed version in 1971 under the title &quot;Godzilla&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. This version of the film was distributed by Maron Films as a double feature with &quot;Island of the Burning Damned&quot;.

===Home media===
The film was released on home video in the United States in 2007 with its original Japanese version.

In 2019, the Japanese version was included in a Blu-ray box set released by the Criterion Collection, which included all 15 films from the series&#x27; Shōwa era.

==Critical response==

The film is commonly regarded by critics and fans as being one of the worst &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, with many criticizing the film’s tone, characters, and overwhelming use of stock footage. 

Anthony Gramuglia and Nicholas Raymond of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; each named &quot;All Monsters Attack&quot; the worst &quot;Godzilla&quot; film, with Gramuglia calling it a &quot;downright painful film&quot;, and Raymond referring to it as &quot;universally disliked by &quot;Godzilla&quot; fans, and for good reason&quot;.

Matthew Jackson of Looper.com ranked the film among the worst &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, criticizing its usage of stock footage, referring to Minilla as &quot;annoying&quot;, and writing that &quot;There&#x27;s nothing necessarily wrong with the premise, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired&quot;.

Jacob Knight of /Film ranked the film as the 27th best &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie out of 31 films, writing that &quot;While it&#x27;s almost universally accepted that &quot;Godzilla&#x27;s Revenge&quot; is the ″&quot;worst&quot;″ &quot;Godzilla&quot; movie by enthusiasts, there&#x27;s an audacious &#x27;so bad it&#x27;s good&#x27; element to the proceedings that makes it endlessly watchable&quot;. Patrick Galvan of Syfy Wire defended the film, calling it &quot;a rather sweet little movie and one of Ishiro Honda&#x27;s most earnest efforts in the Godzilla series. A poignant gem dealing with serious issues — many of them still relevant today — providing food for thought for adults while entertaining its target audience.&quot; Honda once called the movie &quot;one of my favorites&quot;.

<doc id="570255" wikidata="Q701215" url="?curid=570255" title="Open list">
<text>Open list describes any variant of party-list proportional representation where voters have at least some influence on the order in which a party&#x27;s candidates are elected. This is as opposed to closed list, in which party lists are in a predetermined, fixed order by the time of the election and gives the general voter no influence at all on the position of the candidates placed on the party list. 

An open list system allows voters to select individuals rather than, or in addition to parties. Different systems give the voter different amounts of influence to change the default ranking. The voter&#x27;s candidate choices are usually called preference vote; the voters are usually allowed one or more preference votes for the open list candidates.

Open lists differ from mixed-member proportional representation, also known as &quot;personalized proportional representation&quot; in Germany. Some mixed systems, however, may use open lists in their list-PR component.

==Variants==

===Relatively closed===
A &quot;relatively closed&quot; open list system is one where a candidate must reach a full electoral quota of votes on their own to be assured of winning a seat. The total number of seats won by the party minus the number of its candidates that achieved this quota gives the number of unfilled seats. These are then successively allocated to the party&#x27;s not-yet-elected candidates who were ranked highest on the party list.

====Examples====
Iceland: In both parliamentary and municipal elections, voters may alter the order of the party list or strike candidates from the list completely. How many votes need to be altered in this way to have an effect on the results varies by the number of seats won by the party in the constituency or municipality in question and the candidate&#x27;s place on the list. In the parliamentary elections of 2007 and 2009, voters altered the party lists enough to change the ranking of candidates within party lists. However, this did not affect which candidates ultimately got elected to parliament.

Norway: In parliamentary elections, 50% of the voters need to vote for a candidate in order to change the order of the party list, meaning that, in practice, it is almost impossible for voters to change the result and it is de facto a closed list system. In county elections there is a threshold of 8%.

===More open===
In a &quot;more open&quot; list system, the quota for election could be lowered from the above amount. It is then (theoretically) possible that more of a party&#x27;s candidates achieve this quota than the total seats won by the party. It should therefore be made clear in advance whether list ranking or absolute votes take precedence in that case. The quota for individuals is usually specified either as a percentage of the party list quota, or as a percentage of the total votes received by the party.

Example: The quota is 1000 votes and the open list threshold is specified as 25% of the quota, i.e. 250 votes. Therefore, a party which received 5000 votes wins five seats, which are awarded to its list candidates as follows:
Candidates #1, #7 and #4 have each achieved 25% of the quota (250 preference votes or more). They get the first three of the five seats the party has won. The other two seats will be taken by #2 and #3, the two highest remaining positions on the party list. This means that #5 is not elected even though being the fifth on the list and having more preference votes than #2.

In practice, with such a strict threshold, only very few candidates succeed to precede on their lists as the required number of votes is huge. Where the threshold is lower (e.g. in Czech parliamentary elections, 5% of the total party vote is the required minimum), results defying the original list order are much more common.

Parties usually allow candidates to ask for preference votes, but without campaigning negatively against other candidates on the list.

====Austria====

The members of the National Council are elected by open list proportional representation in nine multi-member constituencies based on the states (with varying in size from 7 to 36 seats) and 39 districts. Voters are able to cast a single party vote and one preference votes each on the federal, state and electoral district level for their preferred candidates within that party. The thresholds for a candidate to move up the list are 7% of the candidate&#x27;s party result on the federal level, 10% on the state level and 14% on the electoral district level. Candidates for the district level are listed on the ballot while voters need to write-in their preferred candidate on state and federal level.

====Croatia====

In Croatia, the voter can give their vote to a single candidate on the list, but only candidates who have received at least 10% of the party&#x27;s votes take precedence over the other candidates on the list.

====Czech Republic====

In Czech parliamentary elections, voters are given 4 preference votes. Only candidates who have received more than 5% of preferential votes at the regional level take precedence over the list. For elections to the European Parliament, the procedure is identical but each voter is only allowed 2 preference votes.

====Indonesia====

In Indonesia, any candidate who has obtained at least 30% of the quota is automatically elected.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, the voter can give their vote to any candidate in a list (for example, in elections for the House of the Representatives); the vote for this candidate is called a &quot;preference vote&quot; (&quot;voorkeurstem&quot; in Dutch). Candidates with at least 25% of the quota takes priority over the party&#x27;s other candidates who stand higher on the party list but received fewer preference votes. Most people vote for the top candidate, to indicate no special preference for any individual candidate, but support for the party in general. Sometimes, however, people want to express their support for a particular person. Many women, for example, vote for the first woman on the list. If a candidate gathers enough preference votes, then they get a seat in parliament, even if their position on the list would leave them without a seat. In the 2003 elections Hilbrand Nawijn, the former minister of migration and integration, was elected into parliament for the Pim Fortuyn List by preference votes even though he was the last candidate on the list.

====Slovakia====

In Slovakia, each voter may, in addition to the party, select one to four candidates from the ordered party list. Candidates who are selected by more than 3% of the party&#x27;s voters are elected (in order of total number of votes) first and only then is the party ordering used. For European elections, voters select two candidates and the candidates must have more than 10% of the total votes to override the party list. In the European election in 2009 three of Slovakia&#x27;s thirteen MEPs were elected solely by virtue of preference votes (having party-list positions too low to have won otherwise) and only one (Katarína Neveďalová of SMER) was elected solely by virtue of her position on the party list (having fewer preference votes than a number of other candidates who themselves, nevertheless had preferences from fewer than 10 percent of their party&#x27;s voters).

====Sweden====

In Sweden, a person needs to receive 5% of the party&#x27;s votes for the personal vote to overrule the ordering on the party list. Voting without expressing a preference between individuals is possible, although the parties urge their voters to support the party&#x27;s prime candidate, to protect them from being beaten by someone ranked lower by the party. The share of voters using the open list option at 2022 Swedish general election was 22.49%.

===Most open list===


The &quot;most-open list&quot;, &quot;fully-open list,&quot; or simply &quot;open list&quot; system is one where the number of votes for each candidate fully determines the order of election. This system is used in all Finnish, Latvian, and Brazilian multiple-seat elections. Since 2001, lists of this &quot;most open&quot; type have also been used in the elections to fill the 96 proportional seats in the 242-member upper house of Japan.

===Free lists or panachage===

A &quot;free list&quot;, more usually called panachage or mixed list, is a variant on the most open list where voters may support candidates on &quot;different&quot; lists. Candidates are typically elected using either cumulative or block plurality voting. This gives the voters full control over which candidates are elected, not just within a particular party, but even across them. As a result, independents are not forced to support candidates of only one party, and can support candidates across multiple lists, while still ensuring the results are ultimately proportional.

It is used in elections at all levels in Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Switzerland, in congressional elections in Ecuador, El Salvador, and Honduras, as well as in local elections in a majority of German states, in French communes with under 1,000 inhabitants, and in Czech municipal elections.

==Ballot format==

Some ways to operate an open list system when using traditional paper-based voting are as follows:
*One method (used in Belgium and the Netherlands) is to have a large ballot paper with a box for each party and sub-boxes for the various candidates. In Belgium, when electronic voting is used (in Flanders and Ostbelgien), the voter has to choose with an electronic pencil on a touchscreen between lists and blank vote, then on the list&#x27;s page between the top box (vote for the list without preference for specific candidates) or the box(es) for one or several candidates on the same list.
*Another method (used in Norway, Slovakia and Spain) is to have a separate ballot paper for each party. To maintain voter secrecy, the voter is handed ballot papers for every party. The voter chooses the candidates (or may vote for the party as a whole) on one of the ballot papers, for example, by drawing circles around the candidate numbers (which is why casting preference votes is called &quot;circling&quot; in the Czech Republic and Slovakia). Then, the voter puts the party ballot paper into an envelope and puts the envelope into the ballot box.
* In Brazil, each candidate is assigned a number (in which the first 2 digits are the party number and the others the candidate&#x27;s number within the party). The voting machine has a telephone-like panel where the voter presses the buttons for the number of their chosen candidate. In Finland, each candidate is assigned a 3-digit number.
* In Italy, the voter must write the name of each chosen candidate in blank boxes under the party box.

==Use==

=== By country ===
Some of these states may use other systems in addition to an open list, for example first-past-the-post in individual constituencies. Some countries use open list may only be used in one of the chambers of the legislature.

<doc id="570257" wikidata="Q336538" url="?curid=570257" title="Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo">
<text>Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo ( – 87 BC) was a Roman general and politician, who served as consul in 89 BC. He is often referred to in English as Pompey Strabo, to distinguish him from his son, the famous Pompey the Great, or from Strabo the geographer.

Strabo, the cognomen, means &quot;cross eyed&quot;. He lived in the Roman Republic and was born and raised into a noble family in Picenum (in the south and the north of the modern regions of Marche and Abruzzo respectively) in central Italy, on the Adriatic Coast. Strabo&#x27;s mother was called Lucilia. Lucilia&#x27;s family originated from Suessa Aurunca (modern Sessa Aurunca) and she was a sister of satiric poet Gaius Lucilius. Lucilius was a friend of Roman general Scipio Aemilianus. Strabo&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Gnaeus Pompeius, while his father was Sextus Pompeius. His elder brother was Sextus Pompeius and his sister was Pompeia.

== Career ==

Strabo was a prominent member of the Pompeii, a noble family in Picenum, in central Italy. The Pompeii had become the richest and most prominent family of the region, and had a large clientele and a lot of influence in Picenum and Rome. Despite the anti-rural prejudice of the Roman Senate, the Pompeii could not be ignored. After serving in the military, probably as a military tribune, Strabo climbed the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; and became promagistrate in Sicily 93 BC and consul in the year 89 BC, in the midst of the Social War.

=== Social war ===
Despite Strabo&#x27;s provincial roots, he and his family were Roman citizens and therefore took up Rome&#x27;s cause during the civil war the Republic fought against its Italian Allies. He commanded his forces against the Italian rebels in the northern part of Italy. First he recruited three or four legions in his native Picenum; then he marched them south against the rebels. In 90 BC, while marching his legions south through Picenum, he was suddenly attacked by a large force of Picentes, Vestini and Marsi. Although the battle favoured neither side, Strabo was heavily outnumbered and he decided to withdraw. Eventually he found himself blockaded in Picenum, but in the autumn of 90 he launched two sorties that successfully caught his enemies in a pincer. The remnants of the enemy army retreated to Asculum, which Strabo decided to starve into submission. Through his successful counter-offensive he became very popular, and he used his fame to get elected as one of the consuls for 89 BC, his consular partner being Lucius Porcius Cato. Strabo attacked and defeated a rebel column trying to march into Etruria, killing 5,000 rebels. Another 5,000 died while trying to get back across the Apennines. Strabo&#x27;s consular colleague Lucius Porcius Cato engaged the Marsi in battle near Fucine Lake (close to Alba Fucensis), but he died in an attempt to storm the enemy camp; this left Strabo as sole consul. The exact details of the siege of Asculum and the reduction of the neighbouring tribes are obscure. We hear of a huge battle near Asculum, where Strabo defeated an Italian relief army of 60,000 men. Soon after Asculum fell, Strabo had the rebel leaders whipped and executed, and auctioned off all of their belongings. He kept the proceeds of these sales, an action which might explain his reputation for greed. At the end of his term as consul, Strabo apparently sought a second immediate consulship for the year 88 BC – an act that was not illegal, as the case of Gaius Marius demonstrates in the late second century, but was highly irregular nonetheless. Strabo evidently failed in his attempt, as Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Quintus Pompeius Rufus were elected consuls.

=== Triumph ===
Strabo celebrated a triumph for his victories against the Italian Allies on 27 December 89. After his consulship expired a few days later, he retired to Picenum with all of his veteran soldiers. He did not disband his army but kept it in the field. The Senate soon transferred command of his army to Quintus Pompeius Rufus, one of the new consuls. However, when Pompeius Rufus arrived, he was murdered by Strabo&#x27;s soldiers. Strabo did not interfere when Sulla marched on and took Rome in 88 BC. He remained in Picenum until 87 BC, when he responded to the Senate&#x27;s request for help against Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Cinna who were also marching their forces on Rome. Strabo took his army to Rome; he did, however, not decisively commit to either side, instead playing both against the other. For this, Publius Rutilius Rufus referred to him as &quot;the vilest man alive&quot;. When negotiations with the Cinna-Marian faction fell through he did, however, attack Quintus Sertorius, one of Cinna&#x27;s commanders, who was positioned north of the city, but the attack was without success.

==Death==
In 87 BC, Strabo and his army established their camp outside the Colline Gate. The unsanitary conditions of the camp led to an outbreak of disease among his troops. Strabo himself caught dysentery and died a few days later, still in his camp outside the Colline Gate. His avarice and cruelty had made him hated by the soldiers to such a degree that they tore his corpse from the bier and dragged it through the streets. Another story expounded by Plutarch claimed that the general died after being struck by lightning.

His son, Pompey the Great, took the legions back to Picenum. He would use them to support Sulla a few years later.

Strabo had at least two children: a son, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, and a daughter, Pompeia, who married Gaius Memmius and then Publius Cornelius Sulla.

In his honour his name was given to the cities of &quot;Alba Pompeia&quot; and &quot;Laus Pompeia&quot;.

<doc id="570258" wikidata="Q814166" url="?curid=570258" title="Invasion of Astro-Monster">
<text>is a 1965 &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Ishirō Honda, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. It is the sixth film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise and Shōwa period. The film was a Japanese-American co-production; it was the second collaboration between Toho Co., Ltd. and UPA. The film stars Akira Takarada, Nick Adams, Kumi Mizuno, Akira Kubo, and Yoshio Tsuchiya, with Haruo Nakajima as Godzilla, Masaki Shinohara as Rodan, and Shoichi Hirose as King Ghidorah. In the film, aliens plead with humanity to borrow Godzilla and Rodan to defeat Ghidorah, only to betray the humans and unleash the monsters on the Earth.

&quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; was theatrically released in Japan on December 19, 1965, to mixed reviews from critics. It was followed by a theatrical release in the United States on July 29, 1970, by Maron Films as Monster Zero, on a double bill with &quot;The War of the Gargantuas&quot;.

The film was followed by the seventh film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, &quot;Ebirah, Horror of the Deep&quot;, released on December 17, 1966.

==Plot==
In the year 196X, two astronauts, Fuji and Glenn, are sent to investigate the surface of the mysterious &quot;Planet X&quot; recently detected on the far side of Jupiter. There they encounter advanced and seemingly benevolent human-like beings called the Xiliens and their leader, the Controller. The aliens usher the astronauts into their underground base, and moments later the surface is attacked by a creature that the Xiliens call &quot;Monster Zero&quot;, but which the astronauts recognize as King Ghidorah, a planet-destroying monster that had attacked Earth once before. The monster eventually leaves, but the Controller states that Ghidorah has been attacking repeatedly, forcing them to live underground in constant fear. He requests to borrow the Earth monsters Godzilla and Rodan to act as protectors to fight it once more (since 1964), in return for the cure for cancer (the English dub says that the formula can cure any disease). The astronauts return to Earth and deliver the message.

Meanwhile, an inventor named Tetsuo has designed a personal alarm that emits an ear-splitting electric siren. He sells it to a businesswoman named Namikawa, but she disappears before paying him. Tetsuo is romantically involved with Fuji&#x27;s sister, Haruno, but Fuji disapproves, finding him unworthy of Haruno. Tetsuo sees Namikawa with Glenn and later follows her, but he is captured and imprisoned by Xilien spies.

Glenn and Fuji begin to worry that the Xiliens may have ulterior motives. Their suspicions appear confirmed when three Xilien spacecraft appear in Japan. The Controller apologizes for coming to Earth without permission. The Xiliens locate Godzilla and Rodan, both sleeping, and use their technology to transport them to Planet X. They also bring Glenn, Fuji, and the scientist Sakurai with them. After a brief confrontation, the Earth monsters succeed in driving Ghidorah away. Glenn and Fuji sneak away during the battle and encounter two Xilien women, both of whom look identical to Namikawa. Xilien guards confront the astronauts and bring them back to the Controller, who reprimands but does not punish them. The astronauts are given a tape with instructions for the miracle cure and sent home, leaving Godzilla and Rodan behind. The tape is played for the world&#x27;s leaders, but instead, it contains an ultimatum demanding that they surrender Earth to the Xiliens or be destroyed by Godzilla, Rodan, and Ghidorah, who are all under the aliens&#x27; mental control.

Glenn storms into Namikawa&#x27;s office and finds her in Xilien garb. She admits that she is one of their spies, but confesses that she has fallen in love with him. Her commander arrives to arrest Glenn and executes Namikawa for letting emotion cloud her judgment, but not before she slips a note into Glenn&#x27;s pocket. Glenn is taken to the same cell as Tetsuo. They read Namikawa&#x27;s note, which explains that the sound from Tetsuo&#x27;s invention disrupts the Xiliens&#x27; electronics. Tetsuo has a prototype with him, which he activates, weakening their captors and allowing them to escape.

Sakurai and Fuji build a device to disrupt the Xilien&#x27;s control over the monsters. Glenn and Tetsuo arrive to share the Xilien&#x27;s weakness. As the monsters attack, Sakurai&#x27;s device is activated and the sound from Tetsuo&#x27;s alarm is broadcast over the radio. The invasion is thwarted and the Xiliens, unable to fight back or retreat, destroy themselves en masse. The monsters awaken from their trances and a fight ensues. All three topple off a cliff into the ocean; Ghidorah surfaces and flies back into outer space, while those watching speculate that Godzilla and Rodan are probably still alive. Fuji acknowledges Tetsuo&#x27;s important role in the victory and no longer thinks poorly of him. Sakurai states that he wants to send Glenn and Fuji back to Planet X to study the planet thoroughly (the English dub says that they are to be ambassadors). The astronauts are reluctant, but make the best of the moment, happy that Earth is safe.

Personnel taken from &quot;Japan&#x27;s Favorite Mon-star&quot;.

===Development===

In the mid-1960s, United Productions of America (UPA) asked American producer Henry G. Saperstein to acquire high quality monster movies to distribute in North America. Saperstein approached Toho and began involvement in the film when &quot;Frankenstein Conquers the World&quot; was already in its production phases. The production of &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; saw the film have input from American producer Henry G. Saperstein from the beginning of production and was his first fully-fledged coproduction. Saperstein has claimed to have provided 50 percent of the funding to the three monster movie co-productions he made with Toho.

Saperstein felt that the screenplays by Shinichi Sekizawa were formulaic, noting that these films too often &quot;opened up with a press conference or a government conference of scientists and officials&quot; and that he convinced the production that they &quot;needed to get into the picture a lot quicker. The conference could take place later on&quot;. The film&#x27;s script also incorporates an alien invasion theme that had been done in previous Toho films, but not in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; series.

Saperstein also proposed the inclusion of an American actor to help market the film in the United States. This role was eventually filled by Nick Adams, who had previously starred in &quot;Frankenstein Conquers the World&quot; without any suggestion from Saperstein. Saperstein said Adams was &quot;terrific, a real professional. Very cooperative, always on time, ready with his lines, available, totally cooperative. He loved being there.&quot;

The film had a lower budget than some of the previous films in the series. This led to special effects scenes having less elaborate model cities built and including footage which had been shot for previous films such as &quot;Rodan&quot;, &quot;Mothra&quot;, and &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;. &quot;It was a vicious cycle of time and budget,&quot; Honda reflected. &quot;If we recycled scenes from previous movies, we could cut the effects budget. But then we received complaints from our fans saying, &#x27;It looks weird, it&#x27;s not fresh.&#x27; We could fool the audience for a little while, but eventually they would know the trick and stop coming to see the shows. Then the studio would think that special effects film don&#x27;t sell anymore. It&#x27;s no wonder we could not make anything good around that period... It is a sad story.&quot;

Honda contributed in designing Namikawa&#x27;s makeup. Yoshio Tsuchiya improvised the Planet X Controller&#x27;s hand gestures and combined French, German, and Ryunosuke Akutagawa&#x27;s &quot;Kappa&quot; language to form the alien dialect, at Honda&#x27;s request. While there is a Lake Myojin in Japan, the one featured in the film is fictional. Adams&#x27; scenes were filmed within five weeks, between October 13 to November 18, 1965.

===Special effects===

The film&#x27;s special effects were directed by Eiji Tsuburaya, while Teruyoshi Nakano served as the assistant special effects director. An Oxberry optical printer was used to composite the actors and saucers on the beach. The Godzilla &quot;Shie&quot; victory dance was added after Yoshio Tsuchiya suggested it to Tsuburaya, who was already supportive about anthropomorphizing monster characters with comical traits. Godzilla performer Haruo Nakajima, effects cinematographer Sadamasa Arikawa, and director Ishirō Honda were against the inclusion of the dance. Nakano recalled that audiences were divided over the dance. The design of the P1 rocket and astronaut suits were influenced by NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini missions. Several P1 models were produced, with the biggest reaching 3 meters tall.

In one scene, the effects crew wanted to show the 3-meter P1 lift from a low angle, however, its size would have exposed the top edge of the Planet X set. Against company policy, special effects art director Yasuyuki Inoue broke the sound stage floor, and dug a hole to allow the P1 to rise from the subterranean base. Inoue later got in trouble after the hole was discovered, however, Inoue would later repeat this technique in &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot;. The smoke effects in the Lake Myojin scenes were created by filling a thermos bottle with liquid nitrogen and destroying them underwater to create a chemical reaction. Effects animator Sadao Iizuka created the transport tractor beam and designed it after a Neon club sign he saw in Shibuya ward.

For Godzilla, a new suit was produced by Teizo Toshimitsu. The new suit removed the kneecaps from the previous two film, the breast bone is slightly retained and deemphasized, the dorsal fins are less pointed, and the eyes are enlarged. The pupils were built to be moved from left to right. The suits for King Ghidorah and Rodan were recycled from the previous film, albeit with some alterations. For Ghidorah, the suit was repainted with a darker shade of gold, with fewer details on the faces due to settled rubber. For Rodan, the bulky tops on the wings were flattened and thinned. The melting radar dish model was independently built by a chief carpenter, Keiki Tanaka.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; was released in Japan on December 19, 1965, by Toho, on a double bill with &quot;Young Beats&quot;. The film brought in about 3.8 million viewers in Japan and was the tenth highest grossing Japanese film for that year, earning a distribution rental income of ¥210 million during its theatrical run. Nick Adams&#x27; voice was dubbed over by Gorō Naya for the Japanese release. It was re-issued in Japan in 1971 where it was edited to a 74-minute running time under the title . In an attempt to give Keiko Sawai more roles, Toho had billed Sawai as the &quot;Hope of &#x27;66&quot; in the original posters. With the 1971 re-issue, the film&#x27;s Japanese box office performance increased to ticket sales and distributor rentals of ().

In the United States, the film grossed during its theatrical run. In Europe, the film sold 1,416,731 tickets in Germany and France upon release in 1967.

===American version===
Co-producer Henry G. Saperstein commissioned an English dub from Glen Glenn Sound, a Los Angeles-based company, for the film&#x27;s American release. Unlike some previous &quot;Godzilla&quot; films which were heavily edited for their American release, the American and Japanese versions of the film were described by David Kalat as &quot;virtually identical&quot;. Among the changes in the American version of the film include improvised &quot;Planet X language&quot; scenes spoken by Yoshio Tsuchiya being cut, and a few brief shots involving the flying saucers at Lake Myojin. The audio was changed as well with sound effects added for Godzilla and several pieces of Akira Ifukube&#x27;s score re-arranged. The English dialogue was written by an uncredited Riley Jackson, who was hired by UPA post-production supervisor S. Richard Krown because of his previous work on &quot;Storm Over the Pacific&quot;. Marvin Miller provided the voice for Fuji and other characters. The American version had a running time of 92 minutes.

Originally released as &quot;Invasion of the Astros&quot; at military bases in the United States, the English dub by Glen Glenn Sound was released on July 29, 1970, by Maron Films as part of a double feature with &quot;The War of the Gargantuas&quot; (also dubbed by Glen Glenn Sound). Regarding the time it took for the film to be released in the United States, Saperstein stated that Toho did not always want to release a film quickly for international release and that he had a lot of technical work to be done on the film. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Saperstein had completed post-production in 1966 and was negotiating a distribution deal. &quot;Variety&quot; reported again in September 1970 that both the film and &quot;The War of the Gargantuas&quot; &quot;sat on the shelf at [UPA] because [distributors] figured they had no potential&quot;.

===Critical response===
Jon Matsumoto of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; declared &quot;Godzilla vs. Monster Zero&quot; as &quot;a terrific bad movie&quot;, declaring that the film &quot;contains most of the elements that made this film form so appealing to the average 5- to 12-year-old boy.&quot; and that the film is &quot;riotous adult fun&quot; due to the &quot;unintended shoddiness of the film.&quot;

The presentation for the Criterion Channel states: &quot;This retro romp, featuring American star Nick Adams, stands as a high point in the Showa Godzilla series.&quot;

==Home media==
===Japan===
In 2008, Toho remastered the film in High-definition and premiered it on the Japanese Movie Speciality Channel, along with the rest of the Godzilla films also remastered in HD. In 2021, Toho premiered a 4K remaster of the film on the Nippon Classic Movie Channel, along with seven other Godzilla films also remastered in 4K. The film was downscaled to 2K for broadcast.

===United States===
In 1983, Paramount released the American version of the film on VHS and BetaMax as &quot;Godzilla vs. Monster Zero&quot;. The title &quot;Godzilla vs. Monster Zero&quot; was used when the film was broadcast on local American TV stations.

 In 2007, Classic Media released the film on DVD in North America, along with other &quot;Godzilla&quot; titles. This release included the remastered, widescreen versions of the Japanese and American versions, as well as image galleries, poster slideshows, original trailers, a biography on Tomoyuki Tanaka, and an audio commentary by historian Stuart Galbraith IV. In 2014, Toho released the film on Blu-ray to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the franchise.

In 2017, Janus Films and the Criterion Collection acquired the film, as well as other Godzilla titles, to stream on Starz and FilmStruck. In 2019, the Japanese version and export English version was included in a Blu-ray box set released by the Criterion Collection, which included all 15 films from the franchise&#x27;s Shōwa era. In May 2020, the export English version became available on HBO Max upon its launch.

<doc id="570263" wikidata="Q588011" url="?curid=570263" title="Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster">
<text>is a 1964 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Ishirō Honda, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. Produced and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd., it is the fifth film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, and was the second &quot;Godzilla&quot; film produced that year, after &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot;. The film stars Yosuke Natsuki, Hiroshi Koizumi, Akiko Wakabayashi, with Haruo Nakajima as Godzilla, Masanori Shinohara as Rodan, and Shoichi Hirose as King Ghidorah. In the film, an extraterrestrial from Venus, possessing the body of a princess, warns humanity of the pending destruction by the alien-dragon Ghidorah, with Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra being their last hope for survival.

The film was rushed into production in order to replace &quot;Red Beard&quot;, which fell behind schedule, in Toho&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s holiday slate. The Godzilla suit and Mothra larva prop were recycled from the previous film, with modifications added, while new suits were produced for Rodan and Ghidorah, the latter creating on-set difficulties due to multiple wires attached to the suit. Principal photography began and ended in 1964 in Mount Aso, Yokohama, Gotenba, and Ueno Park.

&quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; was theatrically released in Japan on December 20, 1964, followed by a theatrical release in the United States on September 29, 1965, by Continental Distributing as Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster. It earned ¥375 million (over $1 million) at the Japanese box office and $1.3 million at the American box office. The film received generally positive reviews from early and contemporary American critics.

The film was followed by the sixth film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot;, released on December 19, 1965.

==Plot==
Reporter Naoko Shindo attends a communications session with the UFO society for her television program. However, it is deemed a failure due to Naoko&#x27;s skepticism. A meteor shower soon descends on Japan, with the largest meteor crashing on Mount Kurodake. Naoko&#x27;s brother, Detective Shindo, is assigned to guard Princess Salno of Selgina from a political assassination during an unannounced visit to Japan. En route to Japan, an alien entity leads Salno to jump from her plane before it explodes. Professor Miura leads a research team to Mt. Kurodake to investigate the large meteor, where they discover it randomly emitting magnetic waves. Naoko is sent to investigate a prophetess claiming to be from Venus, who predicts that the pteranodon Rodan will emerge from Mount Aso.

The Prophetess catches the attention of both Shindo and Salno&#x27;s uncle, both of whom recognize her as the supposedly dead Salno. Responsible for the assassination plot, Salno&#x27;s uncle sends the assassin, Malmess, to kill her. After participating in a TV program, the Shobijin, Mothra&#x27;s twin fairies, prepare to depart for home but are warned by the Prophetess to not sail. Naoko takes the Prophetess to a hotel to interview her, and discovers that the Shobijin have been following them, heeding the Prophetess&#x27; warning before the prehistoric sea monster Godzilla sunk their ship. After confirming that the Prophetess is Salno, Shindo finds her at the hotel and saves her from Malmess. They evacuate after Godzilla and Rodan converge on the city and battle throughout the countryside.

After psychiatrist Dr. Tsukamoto concludes that the Prophetess is human, she predicts the arrival of the alien-dragon King Ghidorah, a monster that destroyed her home on Venus. Miura and his team witness the meteor explode, unleashing the golden three-headed space dragon Ghidorah, who proceeds to attack Matsumoto. The authorities plea with the Shobijin to summon the larva monster Mothra for help, but they warn that Mothra alone could not defeat Ghidorah, and their only hope would be for Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra to join forces. Under hypnosis, the Prophetess reveals that some Venusians escaped to Earth from Ghidorah and assimilated with humans, but at the cost of losing most of their abilities except prediction.

After Malmess overhears Tsukamoto recommending shock therapy next, he increases the voltage to a fatal degree, but fails after the power lines are destroyed by Godzilla. After thwarting Malmess and his crew, Shindo evacuates to the mountains with the Prophetess, Tsukamoto, Naoko, Miura, and the Shobijin. Mothra attempts to convince Godzilla and Rodan to set aside their differences to save the planet, but both refuse due to years of harassment from humans. However, after seeing Mothra attempt to battle Ghidorah on her own, Godzilla and Rodan change their minds and rush to her aid. The Prophetess wanders off and regains her memories after Malmess nearly kills her. Shindo manages to protect her just in time and Malmess falls to his death. The monsters overwhelm Ghidorah and force it to flee into outer space. Prior to departing for home, Princess Salno reveals to Shindo that she has no memory as the Prophetess, but remembers the three events when Shindo saved her, and thanks him and Naoko for their help. Godzilla and Rodan watch as Mothra journeys back home with the Shobijin, who bid farewell to all.

===Development===
Toho originally intended to release &quot;Red Beard&quot;, also produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka, for the New Year&#x27;s holiday. However, the film fell behind schedule and Tanaka rushed &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; into production to replace the New Year&#x27;s release slot. After the success of previous cross-over films such as &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot;, Tanaka decided to develop a film that would feature Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra.

The new monster King Ghidorah was designed as an homage to Yamata no Orochi. Film historian David Kalat noted that screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa introduced aliens, like Ghidorah and the eponymous &quot;Dogora&quot;, because he grew tired of tropes where monsters were either awakened by nuclear weapons or worshipped as Gods by indigenous groups. Yoshio Tsuchiya was originally attached to play Malmess but his commitments to &quot;Red Beard&quot; prevented him from participating. Honda felt &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with Toho and Tsuburaya&#x27;s decision to anthropomorphize the monsters and was reluctant to use the singing duo The Peanuts as translators for the summit scene. The film was shot on various locations, such as Mount Aso, Yokohama, Gotenba, and Ueno Park.

Akiko Wakabayashi chose to portray her character similar to a sleepwalker and purposefully avoided eye contact while in character. Honda asked her to take inspiration from Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s character from &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, and based her character&#x27;s homely attire on Wakabayashi&#x27;s real attire; Honda had once spotted her on the studio in jeans and a &quot;bug guy&#x27;s hat.&quot; Wakabayashi was allowed, by Honda, to sleep on the gurney during takes for the shock therapy scenes due to working on a different film the previous night without sleep, and was briefly blinded by the Venusian&#x27;s flash of light.

===Special effects===
The film&#x27;s special effects were directed by Eiji Tsuburaya, while Teruyoshi Nakano served as the assistant special effects director. For Ghidorah&#x27;s hatching scene, a variety of techniques were used such as a miniature meteorite prop, and pyrotechnics; optical animation was used for the hovering fireball and Ghidorah&#x27;s rays. For the Yokohama sequence, pyrotechnics were wire-rigged to send up debris, and fans were used to emulate strong winds. Haruo Nakajima reprised his role as Godzilla, having portrayed the character in the previous four &quot;Godzilla&quot; films. The effects crew recycled the Godzilla suit from &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; but alterations were made to the head such was replacing the original glass-like wooden eyes with radio-controlled eyeballs, and marginally flattening the head by installing mechanics. Katsumi Tezuka portrayed the Mothra larva prop that was also recycled from &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot;, and its eyes were changed from blue to red. Masanori Shinohara portrayed Rodan via a new suit that was constructed with a different appearance for the face, with a muscular neck and triangular wings.

King Ghidorah was designed by Akira Watanabe, with the wings originally intended to bear a rainbow-like hue. Ghidorah was portrayed by Shoichi Hirose, and it proved a grueling task for Hirose which required him to spend hours inside the suit, hunched over and only using a supportive crossbar, while a team of seven men handled the wires attached to the necks, tails, and wings over the soundstage rafters. Filming of the Ghidorah scenes caused delays for various reasons: the necks would tangle with each other, the studio lights would be reflected on the plastic wires, and wires would get caught in the suit&#x27;s scales. Effects cameraman Sadamasa Arikawa described it as an &quot;agonizing operation&quot;. Sekizawa suggested to Tsuburaya that the Ghidorah suit be built from lightweight silicon-based materials to allow more mobility for the suit performer. Small models of the monsters were also used for far away shots or flying shots of Rodan and King Ghidorah.

The set for the base of Mt. Fuji was built at a 1/25th scale and took 12,000 hours to build. The set was raised so cameras could be positioned at low angles. The miniature buildings were built with working sliding doors, and lights, and were built backless, to be seen from one direction. The miniatures meant to be destroyed were pre-cut and compressed. Miniature buildings that were not meant to be destroyed were repurposed for later scenes or other sets. While filming Godzilla and Rodan&#x27;s battle in Toho&#x27;s massive water tank, one of the edges of the tank was exposed on film. Tsuburaya hid this error by superimposing trees on the exposed area.

==Release==
===Theatrical and box office===
&quot;Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on December 20, 1964, by Toho, on a double-bill with &quot;Samurai Joker&quot;. The film earned (over $1 million) in distributor rentals at the Japanese box office, and became the fourth highest-grossing film between 1964 and 1965. In 1971, a heavily re-edited version was screened at the Toho Champion Festival, a children&#x27;s festival centered on marathon screenings of &quot;kaiju&quot; films and cartoons. For the Champion Festival, the film was re-titled , was re-edited by Honda, and runs 73 minutes. The Champion festival release sold 1.09 million tickets.

Months after the film&#x27;s Japanese release, the film was acquired by Walter Reade-Sterling, Inc., with plans to distribute the film in the United States through their subsidiary, Continental Distributing. The film was theatrically released in the United States on September 29, 1965, as &quot;Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;. The film opened to 83 theaters in Boston, on a double-bill with &quot;Agent 8 3/4&quot;. In later areas, it was double-billed with &quot;Harum Scarum&quot;. Continental relayed to &quot;Variety&quot; that the film grossed $1.3 million, including earning $200,000 in film rentals within five days after its release. To promote the film in the United States, Ghidorah masks were created as promotional tie-ins with local supermarkets and radio stations.

===American version===
The dubbing of the American version was supervised by Joseph Belucci, and runs at 85 minutes. The American version shifts some scenes and removes some outright, Akira Ifukube&#x27;s score is replaced with library music during some of the Godzilla/Rodan battle scenes, Mars replaces Venus in the prophetess&#x27;s dialog, and a rough translation was provided for &quot;Cry for Happiness&quot;, which is read off-camera by Annie Sukiyaki. Some alterations from the American version were added to the Champion Festival release. Film historian David Kalat opined that the American version is superior in some ways, stating that the film is dramatically tightened and that continuity corrections resulted in an &quot;improvement over the original&quot;.

===Critical response===
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; to be a better film than &quot;Harum Scarum&quot; (both films were bundled on a double-bill) but found that it would appeal to fans of comic book culture and may interest social historians over what Canby perceives as Japan&#x27;s fascination at destroying their homeland with monsters. While &quot;Variety&quot; criticized the dubbing as &quot;atrocious&quot;, they praised Honda&#x27;s ability to incite cheers from audiences when the Earth monsters unite.

Leonard Maltin awarded the film two and a half stars, calling it &quot;one of the better Toho monster rallies”. Phil Hardy&#x27;s book &quot;Science Fiction&quot; noted that the film&#x27;s visual effects &quot;are better than usual and the cast includes Okada (Mistakenly believing actor Eiji Okada to be in the film), best known for his performance in Resnais&#x27; &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot; (1959), as well as the brilliant Shimura, star of Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Ikiru&quot; (1952).&quot;
&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; awarded the film three stars out of four and stated that the film &quot;embodies much of what the popular monster films have come to be known for over the years: reptilian wrestling matches on a citywide scale, human drama paralleling the monster threat, rubbery creature effects, and the gleeful destruction of many a miniature architectural set piece.&quot;

Film historian August Ragone called the monster effects &quot;somewhat uneven,&quot; but added that &quot;Tsuburaya still delivers a punch with the production&#x27;s bountiful visual effects.&quot;

&quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked the film at number two in their 2019 ranking of the Shōwa Godzilla films, calling it a &quot;superb entry&quot; and describing the battle sequences as &quot;classic.&quot; &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked it at number six on their list of the &quot;Best Kaiju Movies Featuring Mothra&quot;, describing its plot one of the more &quot;whacky&quot; entries within the genre. &quot;Collider&quot; ranked the film number four on their Shōwa Godzilla list in 2022, praising the balance at depicting the monsters as genuine threats while expressing glee at their antics, calling such an approach one of the best &quot;mixes&quot; of the franchise&#x27;s Shōwa era.&quot;

==Home media==
===Japan===
In 2008, Toho remastered the film in High-definition and premiered it on the Japanese Movie Speciality Channel, along with the rest of the Godzilla films also remastered in HD. In 2021, Toho premiered a 4K remaster of the film on the Nippon Classic Movie Channel, along with seven other Godzilla films also remastered in 4K. The film was downscaled to 2K for broadcast.

===United States===
In 2007, Classic Media released the film on DVD in North America, along with other Godzilla titles. This release included the remastered, widescreen versions of the Japanese and American versions, as well as a biography on Eiji Tsuburaya, image galleries, promotional material, and an audio commentary by David Kalat. In 2017, Janus Films and the Criterion Collection acquired the film, as well as other Godzilla titles, to stream on Starz and FilmStruck. In 2019, the Japanese version was included in a Blu-ray box set released by the Criterion Collection, which included all 15 films from the franchise&#x27;s Shōwa era. In May 2020, the Japanese version became available on HBO Max upon its launch.

==Legacy==

The film marks the debut of King Ghidorah, a recurring antagonist of the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. Ragone described King Ghidorah as &quot;one of the most famous and popular creations in the Toho canon.&quot; Don Kaye from &quot;Den of Geek&quot; echoed these sentiments, stating, &quot;Ghidorah remains a formidable enemy, which is why his debut is still one of the best-remembered entries in the series.&quot; The film was also the turning point in Godzilla&#x27;s transformation from villain to hero, with Godzilla taking on a radioactive superhero role. The film also marks the first ensemble between Godzilla and other established monster characters.

<doc id="570269" wikidata="Q633073" url="?curid=570269" title="Mothra vs. Godzilla">
<text>is a 1964 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Ishirō Honda, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. Produced and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd., it is the fourth film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise. The film stars Akira Takarada, Yuriko Hoshi, Hiroshi Koizumi, Kenji Sahara, and Emi and Yumi Itō, with Haruo Nakajima and Katsumi Tezuka as Godzilla. In the film, humans beseech the aid of the divine moth Mothra to stop Godzilla from destroying Japan.

Due to the success of &quot;Mothra&quot; (1961) and &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; (1962), Toho chose to pair Godzilla against Mothra for the following film. The film was intended for children as well as adults, as a way to compete with television&#x27;s growing popularity in Japan. A new Godzilla suit and Mothra prop were built although the 1962 Godzilla suit was used for water scenes. At Tsuburaya&#x27;s insistence, Toho purchased an Oxberry 1900 optical printer to remove damages in composite photography shots. It is the final film in the franchise&#x27;s Shōwa era to depict Godzilla as the antagonist.

&quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on April 29, 1964. An edited version titled Godzilla vs. the Thing was released by American International Pictures in the United States on August 26, 1964. The film received generally positive reviews from early and contemporary American critics. American film historians have praised the film&#x27;s themes of unity, greed, and Honda&#x27;s depiction of Godzilla as a &quot;specter of nuclear annihilation&quot; and a symbol of moral judgement.

The film was followed by the fifth film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, released on December 20, 1964.

==Plot==
Kurata Beach is stricken by a typhoon. The following morning, reporter Ichiro Sakai and his photographer Junko Nakanishi find a strange blue-gray object amongst the wreckage. Later, a giant egg is found floating near Nishi Beach in Shizunoura. Professor Miura attempts to investigate the egg, only to be pestered with questions by Sakai. They soon learn that the villagers had sold the egg to businessman Kumayama for exploitation purposes for his firm Happy Enterprises. At a local hotel, Sakai, Junko, and Miura discuss how to legally counter Kumayama&#x27;s plans, and find him at the lobby. Kumayama meets with his financial backer Jiro Torahata, who reveals his plans to build the Shizunoura Happy Center around the egg. They are visited by the Shobijin, tiny twin fairies, who attempt to convince them to return the egg but have to escape when the businessmen try to capture them. The Shobijin run into Sakai, Junko, and Miura, and reveal to them that the egg belongs to the colossal insect god Mothra, the recent typhoon caused it to wash up on Japanese waters, and destruction will follow when the larva emerges. The trio agree to help them retrieve the egg, and try to plead with Kumayama and Torahata but are met with resistance. The Shobijin eventually return home to Infant Island without the egg.

Later, Sakai writes scathing articles about Happy Enterprises&#x27; insensitivity towards the Shobijin. However, the firm dismisses the articles as slander and open the Shizunoura Happy Center to the public. Kumayama is confronted by the villagers for not paying in full for the egg and renting from their land. Torahata agrees to loan Kumayama additional funds in exchange for putting the egg up as collateral. Kumayama reluctantly accepts and begins incubating the egg. Miura decontaminates Sakai and Junko after touching the object they found in the wreckage, revealing it to be highly radioactive. The trio return to Kurata beach to investigate further, but the giant reptilian monster Godzilla emerges from the buried mud. Citizens evacuate as Godzilla wreaks havoc on Yokkaichi and Nagoya. The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) are deployed to lead Godzilla to the coast to minimize casualties.

At the suggestion of a colleague, the trio travel to Infant Island to appeal to the Shobijin for Mothra&#x27;s help. When they arrive, they are horrified by the desolation left behind by past nuclear tests. They are captured by the natives and reveal their intentions to ask for Mothra&#x27;s help against Godzilla. The Shobijin and natives refuse, seeing it as divine retribution on outsiders for ravaging their island with nuclear tests, and not returning the egg. Junko and Sakai plead that the innocent are also in danger, that they have no right to decide who deserves to live or die, and that civilization is flawed, but is trying hard to make the world better. Mothra agrees to help, but the Shobijin warn that she is on her deathbed.

Back in Japan, the JSDF launch multiple campaigns against Godzilla but to no avail. After losing his fortune, Kumayama confronts Torahata at his hotel, attacks him, and steals his secret funds. Torahata shoots Kumayama, and attempts to escape with the money, but is crushed to death as Godzilla destroys the hotel. Godzilla reaches Nishi Beach, and prepares to destroy the egg until Mothra intervenes and engages Godzilla in battle. Mothra initially gets the upper hand, but is defeated by Godzilla&#x27;s atomic breath. Mothra uses her last strength to fly to the egg and die next to it.

As the JSDF resume their attacks on Godzilla, the trio and the Shobijin remain with the egg as the twins attempt to make the egg hatch more quickly via musical incantations. On Infant Island, the natives join in a ritual dance, in response to the twins&#x27; music. Twin larvae emerge from the egg and follow Godzilla to Iwa island. As the monsters battle, the trio join a rescue party to retrieve students and their teacher left behind on Iwa Island. Godzilla is entrapped by the larvas&#x27; silk, tumbles into the sea and sinks. The students and teacher are returned to safety, and the larvae and Shobijin return to Infant Island. Sakai asserts that humanity will thank them by building a better world.

==Themes==
The film historian Steve Ryfle calls &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; a &quot;classic good-versus-evil stand-off&quot;. He says the film raises philosophical questions about unity and humanity&#x27;s will to put aside their differences for the greater good. Ryfle refers to Godzilla as a &quot;specter of nuclear annihilation&quot;, metaphorically casting its shadow over Japan. Ryfle also describes Godzilla as a symbol of moral judgement after indirectly killing the film&#x27;s villains. The director Ishirō Honda had directed the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954) and &quot;Mothra&quot; (1961) films, and the actor Hiroshi Koizumi said Honda was able to emphasize his themes better through Mothra than Godzilla, stating, &quot;Mothra&#x27;s role was a messenger of peace&quot;. Kenji Sahara said his character Torahata symbolized greed. Honda purposely chose to portray the film&#x27;s version of Infant Island as a partial wasteland as a way to &quot;visualize the terror and the power of the atomic bomb&quot;.

The film historian David Kalat writes that the film brings the shame of civilized man to the forefront, and says that the film&#x27;s Japanese characters do little to nothing to return Mothra&#x27;s egg yet travel to Infant Island to ask Mothra for more. Kalat writes that Mothra is the first to respond to Sakai&#x27;s speech about the brotherhood between mankind, adding that Mothra &quot;possesses a more developed faculty of forgiveness than her subjects,&quot; thus making Mothra &quot;morally and spiritually superior&quot; than humans.

===Development===
After having success with &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; (1962), Toho Co., Ltd. wanted to pair Godzilla with another popular monster and chose Mothra, following the success of her debut film in 1961. Honda and Toho aimed the film towards a general audience due to the rise of television at the time. To prepare for his role, Sahara spent time around &quot;pushy&quot; real-estate agents by posing as a buyer. Tanaka cast the twin sisters Emi and Yumi Itō as the Shobijin due to their popularity as the singing duo The Peanuts, as this would create publicity for the film.

The story in &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; was originally intended to pick up after &quot;Mothra&quot;, with the Rolisicans, the fictional people of the fictional country Rolisica, re-cast as the villains. The screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa&#x27;s earlier drafts have several key differences from the final version: the villain Torahata did not exist; Sakai was accompanied by two scientists, a colleague and a friend&#x27;s mentor; Godzilla&#x27;s body washes ashore rather than Mothra&#x27;s egg; the leads offer themselves as hostages to the Infant Island natives in exchange for Mothra&#x27;s help; Rolisica was to be attacked by Godzilla; the Frontier Missiles were to be used by the Rolisican military; Himeji Castle was to be destroyed; Godzilla was to move East until reaching close to Tokyo; The artificial lightning tactic is conceived when Godzilla is repelled by electrical towers in Tokyo; Mothra attacks Godzilla when he becomes immune to electricity; Mothra engages Godzilla in a final battle when he stalks the lead characters on a beach. Honda changed much of Sekizawa&#x27;s original script to accommodate his own vision. Sakai&#x27;s speech about the brotherhood of man was not in Sekizawa&#x27;s script, but was later added by Honda during filming. The film marks the last time Godzilla is depicted as the antagonist during the franchise&#x27;s Shōwa era.

===Music===
The film score was composed by Akira Ifukube. Ifukube adapted elements from Yuji Koseki&#x27;s &quot;Song of Mothra&quot; theme from the 1961 film into his score. Honda and Ifukube were regular collaborators and held planning sessions to discuss which scenes would feature music. They had a disagreement over a scene which featured Godzilla rising behind a ridge-line. Honda asked for aggressive music for the scene but Ifukube refused, feeling that it was unnecessary due to Godzilla being &quot;impressive enough&quot;. Godzilla&#x27;s theme was eventually added to the scene, which upset Ifukube. The track &quot;The Sacred Springs&quot; was the only track Ifukube wrote for The Peanuts and was intended to lament Infant Island&#x27;s destruction. For the 1980 re-release, the Japanese pop and rock band Talizman recorded a new song simply titled &quot;Godzilla&quot;, which was later included as a bonus feature on Toho&#x27;s 2014 Blu-ray.

===Special effects===
&quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot;″s special effects were directed by Eiji Tsuburaya. Teruyoshi Nakano served as the assistant special effects director. Mechanical props and puppets were built for both monsters. The Godzilla suit was constructed by Teizo Toshimitsu two months prior to filming, with input from the actor Haruo Nakajima whenever he visited the workshop. The new suit was lighter than previous ones and allowed Nakajima to make more fluid movement. Reinforced heels gave Nakajima freedom to roll and flip without losing his footing. The 1962 Godzilla suit was recycled for water scenes and a shot with Godzilla tumbling off a cliff. For Mothra, a new prop was built, similar to the 1961 prop, with Y-shaped braces attached to the back that allowed the wings to flap. High-powered fans were used to create wind for Mothra&#x27;s wings. The wing-span for the new Mothra prop was 15 feet. Mechanisms were added that allowed the prop&#x27;s head and legs to move via remote control.

The larvae were a combination of hand puppetry and motor-driven mechanical props. The larvae&#x27;s web was made of liquified polystyrene. When the web was shot off-screen, it was poured onto a cup stationed at the center of a heavy industrial fan. The cup was sealed with small gaps around the edges. To shoot the web out of the larvae&#x27;s mouths, compressed air was run into a sealed tube of liquid polystyrene. At a high pressure level, the liquid polystyrene was forced through a tube that ran through the back of the larvae and into nozzles in their mouths. As long as the nozzle was small, the solution vaporized when first emitted and solidified into the web. Gasoline had to be used to remove the webbing and the suit had to be thoroughly dried to prevent it from combusting.

The larva movements were designed by Soujiro Iijima and used a conveyor belt with rotating gears that allowed the bodies to move up and down. For the scenes with the Shobijin, furniture eight times their size was built to make the Shobijin appear to be 30 centimeters tall. Honda originally intended to depict the wasteland part of Infant Island with more realism and graphic imagery but this idea was dropped due to budgetary issues with the art department. Honda later regretted this decision, saying he should have been more stubborn.

Tsuburaya had Toho purchase an Oxberry 1900 optical printer which was used to remove damages in composite photography shots. The optical printer was also used to create Godzilla&#x27;s atomic breath. For a scene where Godzilla destroys Nagoya Castle, Nakajima was unable to completely destroy the model of the castle. He attempted to salvage the shot by having Godzilla appear enraged by the Castle&#x27;s strong fortification, but the filmmakers chose to re-shoot the scene with a rebuilt model designed to crumble more easily. For a scene where Mothra drags Godzilla by the tail, the Godzilla suit was used for medium shots and a prop used for long shots. A sequence featuring the United States military attacking Godzilla with frontier missiles was filmed for the American market, but omitted in the Japanese version of the film.

The Mothra prop used for the New Kirk City scenes in &quot;Mothra&quot; was recycled for the Infant Island scenes. This prop was smaller compared to the prop built for the new film&#x27;s adult Mothra. The 1961 model had a motor built into it that flapped the wings at a rapid pace. For the scenes with Godzilla near the cliff face, part of the set&#x27;s support structure was hidden by using matte painting. The miniature tanks used in the film were purchased from Ihara models rather than typically custom built. The tank models were built to a 1/15th scale and were constructed from aluminum. The antennas were used for remote control.

For the scene where Godzilla destroys the incubator, the scene proved difficult for Nakajima and the wire staff, which required coordination. Close ups of the tail were done with a prop that was operated by two people due to the heavy weight of the tail. The scenes with Godzilla thrashing wildly at Mothra were shot at high speed, then projected at a quicker speed. The end results have been compared to the movement of stop-motion animation. The scene with Godzilla thrashing from the nets was shot with different cameras at once and as a result, the same scene plays over from different angles.

A second egg was produced for the hatching scene. A styrofoam egg was molded and a calcium carbonate substance was mixed with glue and added on top. The styrofoam egg was removed from its interior with a heated wire, which left a hollow form. For the opening typhoon scene, Iijima built a shallow water tank to create the illusion of violent waves. Wider water scenes were filmed at a massive pool at Toho&#x27;s studios.

Rubber glue was blown onto Godzilla&#x27;s suit by an electric fan for the scene where Mothra&#x27;s larvae entrap him in silk. In the process of filming, the rubber glue hardened, making it difficult to remove afterwards.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; was released in Japan by Toho on April 29, 1964, as a double feature with &quot;Operation Anti Hell&quot;. Prior to the Golden Week, it sold 3.5 million tickets. According to Henry G. Saperstein, the film grossed $217,000 for three weeks from eight theaters in Tokyo. In 1970, a heavily re-edited version was screened at the Toho Champion Festival, a children&#x27;s festival centered on marathon screenings of &quot;kaiju&quot; films and cartoons. The Champion Festival version was edited by Honda, and runs 74 minutes. The Champion Festival release sold 730,000 tickets. In 1980, the film was theatrically re-released in Japan as a double feature with &quot;&quot;. An entirely new poster featuring an illustration of Godzilla by Japanese manga artist Leiji Matsumoto was designed for the 1980 re-release. It sold three million tickets (¥2.33 billion), totaling tickets sold in Japan.

===American version===
In May 1964, Henry G. Saperstein acquired the American theatrical and television rights to the film, under the proposed working title &quot;Godzilla vs. the Giant Moth&quot;, and sold the rights to American International Pictures (AIP). AIP released the film as &quot;Godzilla vs. the Thing&quot; on August 26, 1964, when it premiered in Los Angeles. AIP chose the title &quot;Godzilla vs. the Thing&quot; purposely to generate curiosity and anticipation for Godzilla&#x27;s foe. AIP hired Reynold Brown to create a poster that featured Godzilla, but censored the other monster. Brown was paid $350 for his services.

The American version of the film contains footage shot by Toho specifically for the American release. The American version of the film received only a few minor adjustments: the Shobijin song on Infant Island was shortened as was a scene where Sakai, Junko Miura and Makamura wave goodbye to the Mothras swimming home. Removed scenes include one of Kumayama handing out leaflets to attract visitors to the giant egg incubator and one where Torahata shoots Kumayama in a hotel room. New scenes added included a sequence where U.S. military officials help Japan against Godzilla. The American release of the film was double-billed with &quot;Voyage to the End of the Universe&quot;. Titra Studios dubbed the film into English. The film was followed by &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, released on December 20, 1964.

===Critical response===
A 1964 review for &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; praised the effects but criticized the military attacking Godzilla, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s strange that the people don&#x27;t learn from the past. From the Self-Defense Forces on down, every single person just plain looks stupid.&quot; In a contemporary review from the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, the critic wrote that &quot;In spite of some clumsy model shots, Godzilla&#x27;s fight with the giant moth and its caterpillar progeny is one of Toho&#x27;s better efforts&quot;. The critic praised Godzilla&#x27;s design in the film and wrote that the &quot;ineffectual attempts to bring him to a halt are cleverly and spectacularly staged. Unfortunately, nothing else quite matches the special effects&quot;, writing that the plot is &quot;ridiculous&quot; and the acting &quot;lamentable, and the two miniature twins&#x27; habit of repeating every line of dialogue simultaneously is intensely irksome&quot;.

Reviewing the American version, &quot;Variety&quot; said it was &quot;long on special effect&quot; and lacked &quot;appeal for general trade&quot;, and that &quot;in spite of the slick production, the story and acting don&#x27;t offer enough to attract large general audiences&quot;. The review said that the &quot;virtually all-Japanese cast, with unfamiliar faces and broad emoting typical of such Japanese pics, also detracts from general appeal&quot;. The review said that Honda&#x27;s direction and the script &quot;keep story moving at lively pace, building up to tense climactic scenes&quot; and that Tsuburaya &quot;labored mightily to cook up monsters and their battles, the tiny twins and the military assaults against Godzilla&quot;.

In 1998, Ryfle praised &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; as it stood &quot;indisputably as the greatest of all the Godzilla sequels, with a fast-paced story and likable characters, the most impressive Godzilla design ever, two of the Big G&#x27;s most spectacular battles, and an abundance of special-effects &quot;money shots&quot; that evoke the thrills of the 1954 original.&quot; In 2017, Ryfle and Godziszewski gave their impression that &quot;[t]he final twenty-plus minutes hint at the genre&#x27;s impending tilt toward young boys. It&#x27;s a near nonstop barrage of military hardware and monster action&quot;, and added that &quot;Honda seemed to know that kids were now rooting for Godzilla, and so the film never gets too scary&quot;.

In his 2007 audio commentary, Ryfle praised the English dubbing for the American version, saying that it is one of the reasons that the film is considered amongst the best Godzilla films. Ryfle said that the English script was &quot;snappy&quot; and &quot;well written&quot; and that the voice performances sounded sincere and pulled with effort, stating, &quot;You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find another movie where the dubbing is done as well as it is here.&quot; Reviewing the American version in 2017, the film critic Leonard Maltin gave it two and a half out of a possible four stars, praising the &quot;vivid&quot; special effects, which he called the highlight of the film.

&quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; at number three in their 2019 ranking of the Shōwa Godzilla films, writing that the film has an &quot;intelligent script that brings together mythology and modern sociopolitical themes is married to some of the best monster action in the series.&quot; &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked it at number three on their list of the &quot;Best Kaiju Movies Featuring Mothra&quot;, calling the film a &quot;kaiju classic&quot; and a &quot;great time overall&quot; despite a lackluster final battle. &quot;Collider&quot; ranked the film number three on their Shōwa Godzilla list in 2022, calling the Godzilla suit an &quot;impressive figure&quot;, the marionette work and puppeteering done with Mothra and the larvae as &quot;impressive&quot;, and describing the battles as the &quot;most unique&quot; in the series.

==Home media==
===Japan===
In 1983, the Japanese version of &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; was released on VHS in Japan by Toho, followed by a LaserDisc release in 1986. The Champion Festival cut was given a LaserDisc release in 1992, and the American version was included on a LaserDisc combo pack the following year. Toho released the film on DVD in 2003, and later included the film, along with the rest of the &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, on the &quot;Godzilla Final Box DVD Set&quot; in 2005. The film was included along with &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954), &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; (1955), and &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot; (1962) on the &quot;Godzilla DVD Collection I&quot;, released by Toho on January 25, 2008. In 2010, Toho released the film on Blu-ray.

In 2008, Toho remastered the film in High-definition and premiered it on the Japanese Movie Speciality Channel, along with the rest of the Godzilla films also remastered in HD. In 2021, Toho premiered a 4K remaster of the film on the Nippon Classic Movie Channel, along with seven other Godzilla films also remastered in 4K. The film was downscaled to 2K for broadcast.

===United States===
In 1989, the American version was released on VHS in North America by Paramount Home Video under the title Godzilla vs. Mothra. In 1998, Simitar Video reissued the American version on VHS and DVD, which included a widescreen edition. This release retained the previous title &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot;, however, the widescreen side of the DVD featured the original American print with the title &quot;Godzilla vs. The Thing&quot;. In 2002, Sony Music Entertainment released a pan-and-scan version of the American version on DVD. This release also retained the previous title, &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot;.

In 2007, Classic Media released both the Japanese and American versions on a single disc DVD in North America. The special features include an audio commentary by film historians Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski, a featurette on Akira Ifukube&#x27;s life and career by Godziszewski and Bill Gudmundson, a slideshow, and the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer. In 2017, Janus Films and The Criterion Collection acquired the film, as well as other Godzilla titles, to stream on Starz and FilmStruck. In 2019, the Japanese version was included in a Blu-ray box set released by the Criterion Collection, which included all 15 films from the franchise&#x27;s 1954–1975 Shōwa era. In May 2020, the Japanese version became available on HBO Max upon its launch.

<text>FleetBoston Financial was a Boston, Massachusetts–based bank created in 1999 by the merger of Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston. In 2004 it merged with Bank of America; all of its banks and branches were converted to Bank of America.

==History==

Fleet&#x27;s oldest predecessor was The Massachusetts Bank founded in 1784. The Massachusetts Bank was the first federally chartered joint-stock owned bank in the United States and only the second bank to receive a charter in the United States. The bank&#x27;s charter was signed by John Hancock and among its early account holders were such notable figures as Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, John Hancock and Henry Knox. The bank&#x27;s founders were largely made up of merchants who wanted to use a U.S., rather than British bank to send money abroad. It was first headquartered at the old Manufactory House, near Boston Common. The bank was the only bank in the city of Boston until the Union Bank (later the Bank of New England) was founded in 1792. This bank became BankBoston which merged into Fleet in 1999.

Fleet&#x27;s direct predecessor began in Providence, Rhode Island in 1791 as the Providence Bank, founded by Rhode Island businessman John Brown. It joined the national banking system in 1865 as Providence National Bank. In 1951, it bought Union Trust Company to form Providence Union Bank and Trust Company. Three years later, it bought Industrial Trust Company to form Industrial National Bank. In 1968, it became the leading subsidiary of Industrial National Corporation.

Industrial began diversifying into non-bank financial services in the mid-1970s. To reflect this, it changed its name to Fleet Financial Group in 1982, with the banking subsidiary becoming Fleet National Bank. It then began an aggressive buying spree of banks outside Rhode Island, most notably the Bank of New England in 1991. In 1988, Fleet merged with Albany, New York–based Norstar Bancorp to form Fleet/Norstar Financial Group. The bank continued to operate as Norstar in New York until 1992, when the company readopted the Fleet Financial Group name.

Fleet was already one of the three largest banks in New England, together with Shawmut National Corporation and its largest affiliate Shawmut Bank, and Bank of Boston. Despite this, state and federal regulators allowed Fleet to merge with Shawmut in 1995. The merger created the largest bank in New England, with over 30 percent of the region&#x27;s deposits. It was also the ninth largest in the United States. Although Fleet was the surviving company, the merged bank was based at Shawmut&#x27;s old headquarters at One Federal Street in Boston.

In 1996, Fleet acquired the US branch network (in New York and New Jersey) of the British National Westminster Bank.

In 1998, Fleet acquired Quick &amp; Reilly discount brokerage and their deep-discount, online subsidiary Suretrade.

Fleet&#x27;s biggest merger came in 1999, when it acquired BankBoston (which was itself the fruit of a 1996 merger between Bank of Boston and BayBank). The new FleetBoston was the culmination of a series of Boston-area bank mergers that combined several smaller banks into a single large institution. FleetBoston was the seventh-largest bank in the United States, as measured by assets (US$197 billion in 2003). It had almost 50,000 employees, over 20 million customers worldwide and revenues of $12 billion per year. The banking subsidiary operated under the Fleet name, but used BankBoston&#x27;s stylized eagle logo. Corporate headquarters moved to BankBoston&#x27;s former headquarters at 100 Federal Street. As a condition for merger, regulators required Fleet to divest 306 New England branches, including 28 to community banks.

In 2000, Fleet acquired New Jersey–based Summit Bancorp which had previously operated as UJB Financial before acquiring Summit in 1996. The same year, Fleet sold 278 of its New England branches to Sovereign Bank as a part of the divestiture plan required by regulators to allow the 1999 acquisition of BankBoston. After Bank of America acquired Fleet in 2004, its overall Customer Satisfaction Index (as measured by the University of Michigan), was lowered from 74 to 72. Bank of America devoted considerable resources to improving its New England branches&#x27; reputation for customer service, establishing customer call centers and hiring more tellers per branch. Fleet&#x27;s former headquarters now serves as the base for Bank of America&#x27;s New England operations.

==Sponsorships==
When the arena was built to replace the aging Boston Garden, Fleet acquired the naming rights to the newly built Shawmut Center. The arena therefore opened as the FleetCenter in 1995. After FleetBoston&#x27;s sale to Bank of America in 2004, the bank chose to give up its naming rights and an announcement was made on March 3, 2005 that the arena would be renamed TD Banknorth Garden (now simply the TD Garden). It is home to the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association and the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League.

==Controversies==
In 2002, FleetBoston Financial, along with Aetna and CSX Transportation, was sued by Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, head of the nonprofit Restitution Study Group of Hoboken, New Jersey. The suit asked for &quot;unspecified damages, restitution for unpaid slave labor and a share of corporate profits derived from slavery&quot; from the three companies. The lawsuit claimed FleetBoston Financial, Aetna, and CSX were &quot;unjustly enriched&quot; by &quot;a system that enslaved, tortured, starved and exploited human beings&quot;. Prior to the abolition of slavery, predecessor banks which formed FleetBoston Financial were involved in the American slave trade. The suit was dismissed in 2004. 

FleetBoston faced a class-action suit over a &quot;bait and switch&quot; scam where it promised a no-annual fee credit card, only to impose a fee months later.

<doc id="570274" wikidata="Q224960" url="?curid=570274" title="Space Interferometry Mission">
<text>The Space Interferometry Mission, or SIM, also known as SIM Lite (formerly known as SIM PlanetQuest), was a planned space telescope proposed by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in conjunction with contractor Northrop Grumman. One of the main goals of the mission was the hunt for Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of nearby stars other than the Sun. SIM was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2010. In addition to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM would have helped astronomers construct a map of the Milky Way galaxy. Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars, assisting in the determination of the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and in the local group of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars. The spacecraft would have used optical interferometry to accomplish these and other scientific goals.

The initial contracts for SIM Lite were awarded in 1998, totaling US$200 million. Work on the SIM project required scientists and engineers to move through eight specific new technology milestones, and by November 2006, all eight had been completed. SIM Lite was originally proposed for a 2005 launch, aboard an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). As a result of continued budget cuts, the launch date was pushed back at least five times. NASA had set a preliminary launch date for 2015. As of February 2007, many of the engineers working on the SIM program had moved on to other areas and projects, and NASA directed the project to allocate its resources toward engineering risk reduction. However, the preliminary budget for NASA for 2008 included zero dollars for SIM.

In 2007, the Congress restored funding for fiscal year 2008 as part of an omnibus appropriations bill which the President later signed. At the same time the Congress directed NASA to move the mission forward to the development phase. In 2009 the project continued its risk reduction work while waiting for the findings and recommendations of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey, Astro2010, performed by the National Academy of Sciences, which would determine the project&#x27;s future.

In 2010, the Astro2010 Decadal Report was released and did not recommend that NASA continue the development of the SIM Lite Astrometric Observatory. This prompted NASA Astronomy and Physics Director, Jon Morse, to issue a letter on 24 September 2010 to the SIM Lite project manager, informing him that NASA was discontinuing its sponsorship of the SIM Lite mission and directing the project to discontinue Phase B activities immediately or as soon as practical. Accordingly, all SIM Lite activities were closed down by the end of calendar year 2010.

==Mission==

SIM Lite would have operated in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit, drifting away from Earth at the rate of 0.1 AU per year ultimately reaching a distance of 82 million km from Earth. This would have taken approximately  years. The Sun would have continuously shone on the spacecraft, allowing it to avoid the occultations of target stars and eclipses of the Sun that would occur in an Earth orbit.

Had it been launched, SIM would have performed scientific research for five years.

===Planet hunting===

SIM Lite would have been the most powerful extrasolar planet hunting space telescope ever built. Through the technique of interferometry the spacecraft would be able to detect Earth-sized planets. SIM Lite was to perform its search for nearby, Earth-like planets by looking for the &quot;wobble&quot; in the parent star&#x27;s apparent motion as the planet orbits. The spacecraft would have accomplished this task to an accuracy of one millionth of an arcsecond, or the thickness of a nickel viewed at the distance from Earth to the Moon. Titled the Deep Search, the planet hunting program was intended to search approximately 60 nearby stars for terrestrial planets (like Earth and Venus) in the habitable zone (where liquid water can exist throughout a full revolution (one &quot;year&quot;) of the planet around its star). The Deep Search was to be the most demanding in terms of astrometric accuracy, hence the name, Deep Search. This program would have used the full capability of the SIM Lite spacecraft to make its measurements.

A flexible search strategy tunes SIM Lite&#x27;s mass sensitivity at each star to a desired level in the habitable planet search. The value of ηEarth (Eta_Earth), the fraction of stars carrying Earth-analog planets, will be estimated by the Kepler Mission some time before SIM Lite launches. One strategy for a habitable planet search is to do a &#x27;deeper&#x27; search (i.e. to lower mass sensitivity in the habitable zone) of a smaller number of targets if Earth analogs are common. A &#x27;shallower&#x27; search of a larger number of targets could have been done if Earth analogs are rarer. For example, assuming that 40% of mission time is allocated for the planet search, SIM Lite could have surveyed:

* 65 stars for planets down to one Earth mass, in scaled 1 AU orbits, OR
* 149 stars for planets down to two Earth masses, in scaled 1 AU orbits, OR
* 239 stars for planets down to three Earth masses, in scaled 1 AU orbits.

Aside from searching for Earth-sized planets SIM Lite was scheduled to perform what has been dubbed the &quot;Broad Survey&quot;. The Broad Survey would have looked at approximately 1,500 stars to help determine the abundance of Neptune-mass and larger planets around all star-types in Earth&#x27;s sector of the Milky Way.
A third part of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped scientists understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems with one or more Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star&#x27;s radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM would have been able to execute its three primary planet-finding missions.

The mission&#x27;s planet finding component was set up to serve as an important complement to the future missions designed to image and measure terrestrial and other exoplanets. SIM Lite was to perform an important task that these missions will not be capable of: determining planet masses. Another task that the SIM was envisioned to perform for the future missions will include providing the orbital characteristics of the planets. With this knowledge other missions can estimate the optimal times and projected star–planet separation angles for them to observe the terrestrial (and other) planets SIM has detected.

===Stellar mass===

Another key aspect of SIM Lite&#x27;s mission was determining the upper and lower limits of star&#x27;s masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent the lower end of the stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.

Part of the SIM&#x27;s mission was to provide pinpoint measurements for the two extremes in stellar mass and evolution. The telescope will not be able to measure the mass of every star in the Galaxy, since there are over 200 billion, but instead, it will take a &quot;population census.&quot; Through this technique, SIM will be able to output accurate masses for representative examples for nearly every star type, including brown dwarfs, hot white dwarfs, red giant stars, and elusive black holes. Current space telescopes, including NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope, can accurately measure mass for some types of stars, but not all. Estimates put the range for stellar mass somewhere between 8% the mass of the Sun and in excess of 60 times the mass of the Sun. The entire study was to focus on binary star systems, stars coupled through a mutual gravitational attraction.

===Galactic mapping===

Interferometric measurements of stellar positions over the course of the mission would have permitted SIM to precisely measure the distances between stars throughout the Milky Way. This would have allowed astronomers to create a &quot;roadmap&quot; of the Galaxy, answering many questions about its shape and size.

Currently, astronomers know little about the shape and size of our galaxy relative to what they know about other galaxies; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band as a member of the band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.

SIM Lite measurements of Milky Way stars were to yield data to understand four topics: fundamental galactic parameters, the Oort Limit, disk mass potential, and mass of the Galaxy to large radii. The first, fundamental galactic parameters, was aimed at answering key questions about the size, shape and the rotation rate of the Milky Way. The team hoped to more accurately determine the distance from the Sun to the Galactic Center. The second topic, the Oort Limit, would have attempted to determine the mass of the galactic disk.

The third project topic was disk mass potential. This topic was designed to make measurements of the distances to disk stars as well as their proper motions. The results of the third topic of study were to be combined with the results of the fundamental galactic parameters portion of the study to determine the Solar System&#x27;s position and velocity in the galaxy. The final topic dealt with dark matter distribution in the Milky Way. SIM data was to be used to create a three-dimensional model of mass distribution in the Galaxy, out to a radius of 270 kiloparsecs (kps). Astronomers were to then use two different tests to determine the galactic potential at large radii.

===Dark matter===

Dark matter is the matter in the universe that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in the universe is dark matter. The spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.

The strongest evidence for dark matter comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate much faster than the amount of visible matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter is not enough to hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the galaxy is held together by huge quantities of dark matter. Similarly, clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.

Besides measuring stellar motions within the Milky Way, SIM Lite was to measure the internal and average galactic motion of some of the neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope&#x27;s measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.

==Development==

===Beginnings===
The Space Interferometry Mission began as a four-month preliminary architecture study in March 1997. NASA selected TRW&#x27;s Space &amp; Electronics Group, Eastman Kodak and Hughes Danbury Optical Systems to conduct the study. In 1998, TRW Inc. was selected as the contractor for the SIM Lite project; Northrop Grumman acquired part of TRW in 2002 and took over the contract. Also selected was Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space located in Sunnyvale, California. The two contracts, which included the mission formulation and implementation phases, were announced in September 1998 and worth a total of over US$200 million. The formulation phase of the mission included initial mission design and planning for the full scale implementation of the mission. At the time of the NASA announcement, launch was scheduled for 2005 and the mission was part of the Origins Program, a series of missions designed to answer questions such as the origin of life Earth.

In August 2000, NASA asked project managers to consider looking at the Space Shuttle, instead of the previously proposed EELV, as a launch vehicle. In late November 2000, NASA announced that the project&#x27;s scientific team was selected. The group included notable names from the world of extrasolar planet research. The entire group consisted of 10 principal investigators and five mission specialists. At the time of this NASA announcement launch was scheduled for 2009 and the mission was still part of the Origins Program.

===New technologies===
SIM&#x27;s new technology was meant to lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM&#x27;s technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.

One of the new technologies developed for the mission were high-tech &quot;rulers&quot;, capable of making measurements in increments a fraction of the width of a hydrogen atom. In addition, the rulers were developed to work as a network. The mission team also created &quot;shock absorbers&quot; to alleviate the effects of tiny vibrations in the spacecraft which would impede accurate measurements. Another of the milestones involved combining the new &quot;rulers&quot; and &quot;shock absorbers&quot; to prove that the Space Interferometry Mission craft could detect the tiny wobbles in stars caused by Earth-sized planets. The fifth of the technology milestones required the demonstration of the Microarcsecond Metrology Testbed at a performance of 3,200 picometers over its wide angle field of view. The wide angle measurements were to be used to determine the fixed positions of stars each time they were measured. This level of performance demonstrated SIM Lite&#x27;s ability to calculate the astrometric grid. Another key development, known as gridless narrow-angle astrometry (GNAA), was the ability to apply the measurement capability worked out in the wide angle milestone and take it a step further, into narrow-angle measurements. Aiming to give an accuracy of 1 micro-arcsecond to the early stages of the SIM, the technique allows star positions to be measured without first setting up a grid of reference stars; instead, it sets up a reference frame using several reference stars and a target star observed from different locations, and star positions are calculated using delay measurements from separate observations. The narrow angle field was to be used by SIM to detect terrestrial planets; the team applied the same criteria to both the narrow and wide angle measurements. The final requirement before beginning work on flight controls was to make sure that all of the systems developed for the mission worked cohesively; this final NASA technology goal was completed last as it was dependent upon the others.

===Status after 2006===
Between the end of April and June 2006 the project completed three engineering milestones and from 2–8 November 2006 SIM completed a &quot;Spacecraft Internal Design Review.&quot; As of June 2008, all of the eight engineering milestones were successfully completed.

The project had been in Phase B since June 2003. Jet Propulsion Laboratory&#x27;s &quot;Phase B&quot; is called the &quot;Preliminary Design&quot; phase. Phase B further develops the mission concept developed during Phase A to prepare the project for entry into the Implementation Phase of the project. Requirements are defined, schedules are determined, and specifications are prepared to initiate system design and development.&quot; In addition, as part of Phase B, the SIM Lite project was to go through a number of reviews by NASA including System Requirements Review, System Design Review, and Non-Advocate Review. During this phase, experiments would have been proposed, peer reviewed, and eventually selected by NASA&#x27;s Office of Space Science. Experiment selections are based on scientific value, cost, management, engineering, and safety.

===Planned launch===

The launch date for the SIM Lite mission was pushed back at least five times. At the program&#x27;s outset, in 1998, the launch was scheduled for 2005. By 2000, the launch date had been delayed until 2009, a date that held through 2003; though some project scientists cited 2008 in late 2000. Between 2004 and 2006, contractor Northrop Grumman, the company designing and developing SIM, listed a launch date of 2011 on their website. With the release of the FY 2007 NASA budget, predictions changed again, this time to a date no earlier than 2015 or 2016. The delay of the launch date was primarily related to budget cuts made to the SIM Lite program. The 2007 change represented a difference of about three years from the 2006 launch date, outlined in NASA&#x27;s FY 2006 budget as being two years behind 2005 budget predictions.
Other groups predicted dates matching officially predicted launch dates; the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (formerly the Michelson Science Center) at the California Institute of Technology also set the date at 2015. As of June 2008, NASA has postponed the launch date &quot;indefinitely&quot;.

A May 2005 NASA operating plan put the mission into a replanning phase through the spring of 2006. The launch was planned to be via an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), likely an Atlas V 521 or equivalent.

===Budget===
SIM Lite was to be considered the flagship mission of NASA&#x27;s Exoplanet Exploration Program (formerly known as the Navigator Program). According to the 2007 Presidential Budget for NASA, the program is, &quot;a coherent series of increasingly challenging projects, each complementary to the others and each mission building on the results and capabilities of those that preceded it as NASA searches for habitable planets outside of the Solar System.&quot; The program, in addition to the Space Interferometry Mission, includes the Keck Interferometer and the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. When originally approved in 1996, the mission was given a $700 million cap (in 1996 dollars) which included launch costs and five years of operation. The first contracts, for the preliminary architecture study, were worth $200,000 each.

NASA&#x27;s budget outlined plans for the three projects for fiscal year (FY) 2007. Of the three missions, SIM Lite was delayed further and the Keck Interferometer saw budget cuts. The 2007 NASA budget stipulated, &quot;SIM Phase B activity will continue while new cost and schedule plans are developed, consistent with recent funding decisions.&quot; The funding decisions included a US$118.5 million cut over the FY 2006 NASA budget request for the Exoplanet Exploration Program. The budget also laid out projections for the program through the year 2010. Each year will have successive funding cuts, if compared to the 2006 request numbers. Starting with FY 2008, the Exoplanet Exploration Program will receive around $223.9 million less compared to 2006. The following years will have cuts of $155.2 million in 2009 and $172.5 million in 2010, compared to the 2006 request.

When SIM Lite entered what JPL terms &quot;Phase B&quot; in 2003 &quot;Fringes: Space Interferometry Mission Newsletter&quot;, called it a most important milestone on the way to a 2009 launch. The delays are budgetary in nature. In 2006, the mission received $117 million, an increase of $8.1 million over the previous year, but 2007 cuts amounted to $47.9 million less for the SIM program. In 2008, $128.7 million of the $223.9 million estimated to be cut from the Exoplanet Program budget would come from the SIM Lite mission. After an additional $51.9 million decrease in FY 2009, the program was reduced to $6 million in FY 2010 supplemented by substantial carryover from the previous year while awaiting the results of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey, Astro2010.

By February 2007 many of the budget cuts outlined in the FY 2007 budget were already being felt within the project. Engineers who worked on SIM were forced to find other areas to work in. A February 2007 editorial in the &quot;Space Interferometry Mission Newsletter&quot; described the situation as, &quot;entirely due to budget pressures and priorities within the Science Mission Directorate at NASA (with) scientific motivation for the mission...as strong as ever.&quot; NASA, per the budget cuts, directed the SIM project to refocus its efforts toward engineering risk reduction. As of the February 2007 newsletter the plans for the refocus were in the process of being completed.

==Instruments==

===Optical interferometry===

Interferometry is a technique pioneered by Albert A. Michelson in the 19th century. Optical interferometry, which has matured within the last two decades, combines the light of multiple telescopes so that precise measurements can be made, akin to what might be accomplished with a single, much larger telescope. It is the interaction of light waves, called interference, that makes this possible. Interference can be used to cancel out the glare of bright stars or to measure distances and angles accurately. The construction of the word partially illustrates this: interfere + measure = interfer-o-metry. At radio wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, interferometry has been used for more than 50 years to measure the structure of distant galaxies.

The SIM Lite telescope functions through optical interferometry. SIM was to be composed of one science interferometer (50 cm collectors, 6 m separation [baseline]), a guide interferometer (30 cm collectors, 4.2 m baseline), and a guide telescope (30 cm aperture). The sophisticated guide telescope stabilizes instrument pointing in the third dimension. The spacecraft&#x27;s operational limiting magnitude would have gone down to 20 at 20 millionths of an arcsecond (μas) and its planet-finding, astrometric accuracy of 1.12 μas is for single measurements. The accuracy of its global, all-sky astrometric grid would have been 4 μas.

SIM&#x27;s design since 2000 consisted of two light collectors (strictly speaking, they are Mersenne telescopes) mounted on opposite ends of a six-meter structure. The observatory would have been able to measure the small wobbles in stars and detect the planets causing them down to one Earth mass at distances up to 33 light years (10 parsecs) from the Sun.

<doc id="570279" wikidata="Q1273736" url="?curid=570279" title="Godzilla Raids Again">
<text>is a 1955 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film directed by Motoyoshi Oda, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. Produced and distributed by Toho Co., Ltd., it is the second film in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, and a sequel to &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954). The film stars Hiroshi Koizumi, Setsuko Wakayama, Minoru Chiaki, and Takashi Shimura, with Haruo Nakajima as Godzilla and Katsumi Tezuka as Anguirus. In the film, Japan struggles to survive Godzilla&#x27;s return, as well as its destructive battle against its ancient foe Anguirus.

Executive producer Iwao Mori instructed producer Tomoyuki Tanaka to immediately commence production on a second &quot;Godzilla&quot; film, fearing to lose the momentum of the first film&#x27;s success. Oda was chosen to direct the film as Ishirō Honda was busy directing &quot;Lovetide&quot;.

&quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on April 24, 1955. A re-edited, English dubbed version was released theatrically in the United States on June 2, 1959, by Warner Bros. Pictures, under the title Gigantis, the Fire Monster.

The film was followed by &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;, released on August 11, 1962.

==Plot==
Working for Kaiyo Fishing, Inc., a pilot named Shoichi Tsukioka guides a fishing trawler towards a school of Bonito. Koji Kobayashi, another pilot, faces engine troubles and makes an emergency landing on Iwato Island. Tsukioka is sent to rescue Kobayashi, but they both encounter two giant dinosaur monsters locked in battle: Godzilla and a new quadruped monster. The pilots escape as the monsters tumble into the sea.

Tsukioka and Kobayashi go to Osaka to help Dr. Yamane and the authorities investigate the encounter. The new monster is identified as an Ankylosaurus and is named Anguirus. Dr. Yamane shows the authorities footage of the first Godzilla attack and notes that it was killed by the Oxygen Destroyer, but its inventor died, and that there are no proven countermeasures left against Godzilla. Dr. Yamane suggests issuing a blackout and using drop flares to lure Godzilla away due to the first Godzilla being sensitive to light.

Tsukioka’s girlfriend, Hidemi, expresses her concern for Osaka to him, and he reveals that he thought about her when he thought he might die on Iwato Island. They watch as the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) takeoff to find Godzilla, but scientists note that it may prove difficult due to the possibility of Godzilla hiding in caves within the seabed. Later, Godzilla is spotted heading for the Kii Channel between Shikoku and Wakayama Prefecture. Yamaji, Tsukioka’s boss and Hidemi’s father, notes that if Godzilla wreaks havoc in those waters, their fishing company will lose valuable fishing ground and strike a blow at production.

Later, an alert is issued for the Osaka region as Godzilla changes course for Osaka Bay. The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) cut off the lights in the city and lure Godzilla with flares. Tsukioka leaves Hidemi at her home for safety and leaves with Kobayashi to meet Yamaji at his cannery. Convicts escape from their transport and lead police on a chase that ends with a few convicts crashing into an oil refinery, triggering an explosion, while other convicts escape into Osaka. The explosion lures Godzilla back to Osaka, forcing the JSDF to attack it. Attracted by the flares, Anguirus emerges and engages Godzilla. The monsters battle throughout the city, destroying Yamaji’s cannery and killing the convicts in the process. Godzilla kills Anguirus and returns to the sea after burning the body with its atomic breath.

In the aftermath, Yamaji moves operations to Hokkaido to make full use of the fisheries and cannery, and also sends Kobayashi to guide trawlers. During a company dinner, Tsukioka reunites with Tajima, a friend from college, and the war. Kobayashi hints to Hidemi that he’s fallen in love with a certain woman. The dinner is interrupted by news that a ship was sunk by Godzilla. The following morning, Tsukioka helps the JASDF search for Godzilla and tracks its location on Kamiko Island. Kobayashi departs to aide Tsukioka but leaves his notebook behind. Hidemi peeks at the notebook and discovers a picture of her inside.

Kobayashi attempts to stop Godzilla from escaping but is struck by Godzilla’s atomic breath and crashes into the mountaintop, killing him. The crash creates a small avalanche that engulfs Godzilla, inspiring the JASDF to bury it with a bigger avalanche. Because they lack firepower, the JASDF return to base to reload missiles and Tajima reluctantly accepts Tsukioka’s request to take him. The JSDF creates a wall of fire to block Godzilla’s escape, while the JASDF triggers avalanches by blasting the mountaintops. Godzilla exhales one last atomic breath before being completely buried by the last avalanche triggered by Tsukioka. Relieved, Tsukioka lets Kobayashi’s spirit know that they have finally defeated Godzilla.

===Development===
A few weeks after &quot;Godzilla&quot; was released in November 1954, a welcome home party was held for executive producer Iwao Mori. During the party, Mori instructed producer Tomoyuki Tanaka to produce a sequel, due to Mori being pleased with the box office results for the first film.

Ishirō Honda, director of the first &quot;Godzilla&quot; film, was unavailable to return to direct the sequel due to directing &quot;Lovetide&quot; at the time. Japanese publications indicated that Tanaka attached Motoyoshi Oda to direct the film, rather than waiting for Honda, due to Mori fearing to lose the momentum of the first &quot;Godzilla&quot; film&#x27;s success. Film historians Steve Ryfle and David Kalat deduced that Oda was chosen to direct due to his experience with effects-driven films such as &quot;Eagle of the Pacific&quot;, and his then-latest film &quot;The Invisible Avenger&quot;. Kalat added that Oda was a director content with accepting B–picture level assignments, stating, &quot;putting such a man in charge of the Godzilla sequel then was a clear signal of intent: This was to be a quickie profit center, not an artistic indulgence.&quot;

Screenwriter Takeo Murata originally wanted to show a scene of chaos and looting in the middle of the monster battle, but time and budget limitations forced him to drop this idea. &quot;The Dinosaur Book&quot; by Edwin H. Colbert was used during the film&#x27;s conference scene.

===Special effects===

The film&#x27;s special effects were directed by Eiji Tsuburaya. Some of the effects footage was shot at a slower speed, 18 frames per second. Three cameras were set to capture the effects footage. Two cameras were set at high speed, while the third was indirectly left at slow speed. Despite the error, Tsuburaya felt the slow speed footage was usable and since then, used different camera speeds for different scenes. Some Japanese publications identified Yoichi Manoda as the cameraman who accidentally left the third camera on slow speed, while others identified Koichi Takano as the culprit.

Haruo Nakajima portrayed Godzilla and Katsumi Tezuka portrayed Anguirus, respectively. Nakajima and Tezuka were able to move in the suits more fluidly due to the suits being made from lighter materials, as well as casting them from plaster molds to fit the suit performers&#x27; physiques. For Godzilla, the new design was sculpted by Teizo Toshimitsu. The Godzilla suit was constructed with a cloth-base where latex was applied over it. A motor was built into the head to move the eyes and mouth, with the batteries built at the base of the tail. Due to this, Nakajima felt discomfort each time he jumped in the suit. For Anguirus, Tezuka had to crawl on his knees with the bottom of his feet exposed. The effects crew hid this by placing trees, buildings, and other obstacles in the foreground and filming from certain angles that hid the hind legs.

Hand puppets were built for close-up shots. The Godzilla puppet had a spray built in to depict the atomic breath. Some of the monster battles were photographed from low angles to emphasize size and scale. The Osaka miniature set was constructed at Toho&#x27;s then-new soundstage No. 8, which allowed the effects crew more space to work in. The Osaka castle miniature failed to crumble as planned. Wires were attached to the castle that ran beneath the platform. Due to heavy construction, the model failed to collapse even when the suit performers rammed into it as the crew members pulled the wires. Tsuburaya ordered to &quot;cut&quot; but the crew members did not hear him and the castle model collapsed when camera were not rolling. Due to this, the model had to be partially rebuilt. The ice island battle was partially filmed on an outdoor set. To bury Godzilla in ice, an ice machine was borrowed from the Tokyo skating rink.

For the opening scene, Nakajima and Tezuka were required to be in the suits as they plummeted into the water in order to avoid having the suits float upon impact. Several handlers were on-set to prevent Nakajima and Tezuka from drowning. A Godzilla prop equipped with a wind up motor was built to walk during the ice island scenes, however, the prop malfunctioned and was filmed in a stationary position instead. Real snow was added for the ice island set. Several shots of Godzilla reacting to the ice canyon explosions were filmed outdoors in order to avoid filming the roof of the studio set.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; was distributed theatrically in Japan by Toho on April 24, 1955. The film generated 8.3 million tickets, less than what the first &quot;Godzilla&quot; film drew but still considered moderate business. The film drew little enthusiasm from audiences, the press, and Toho staff. Tanaka later admitted that the crew had little time to prepare and hardly considers the film a success. The Japanese version was released to Japanese speaking theaters in the United States prior to the altered American version. The film was Toho&#x27;s fourth highest-grossing film of the year domestically, and the 10th highest grossing Japanese release domestically.

A re-edited English dubbed version titled &quot;Gigantis, the Fire Monster&quot; was released theatrically in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on May 21, 1959, where it played as a double feature with &quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot;. Some drive-ins paired the film with &quot;Rodan&quot;.

===American version===
The North American rights to the film were purchased by Harry Rybnick, Richard Kay, Edward Barison, Paul Schreibman, and Edmund Goldman, the same producers who acquired the rights to &quot;Godzilla&quot; and released it as &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot;. Instead of dubbing the film, the producers first planned to produce a new film titled &quot;The Volcano Monsters&quot;, while utilizing the effects footage from the original Japanese film. The producers announced in &quot;Variety&quot; that filming was expected to commence on June 17, 1957. Rybnick hired Ib Melchior and Edwin Watson to write the screenplay.

Melchior and Watson spent hours watching the Japanese version on a Moviola to build an American story around the footage and to note down footage of the monsters, military mobilization, crowds fleeing, and jets flying and attacking. The duo completed a 129 paged script, dated May 7, 1957, with instructions for the editor of where the Japanese footage was to be used. In their script, Godzilla and Anguirus were changed to dinosaurs, with Godzilla identified as a female Tyrannosaurus. All shots of Godzilla using his atomic breath were eliminated, to be replaced with new footage of Godzilla swiping his claws at jets. Panic, disaster, and military mobilization scenes from news reels were to be included between the Japanese monster footage. The blackout was re-written to signify that the monsters destroyed a power plant. The new effects footage was to be shot at Howard A. Anderson&#x27;s special effects studio.

Toho approved of the idea and in early 1957, shipped the Godzilla and Anguirus suits to Los Angeles for additional photography. While filming &quot;Invasion of the Saucer Men&quot;, Bob Burns III and Paul Blaisdell recalled stumbling upon two crates holding the Godzilla and Anguirus suits. Burns recalls that the suits were made out of rubber over canvas and had already been used due to significant burns and damages. Howard A. Anderson Jr. told Burns that they recently received them at the time and were intended for &quot;shooting some inserts.&quot;

Rybnick and Barison initially struck a deal with AB-PT Pictures Corp. to co-finance the film but the company closed shop in 1957. Schreibman, Goldman, and then-new financier Newton P. Jacobs decided to dub the film instead. Hugo Grimaldi was hired to oversee the dubbing and editing of the film. Masaru Sato&#x27;s original music was replaced (except for a couple of tracks) with stock music from various libraries, including the MUTEL library, as well as music from films such as &quot;Kronos&quot; (1957), &quot;Project Moonbase&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; (1957). Godzilla&#x27;s roar was largely replaced with Anguirus&#x27; roar. This version had the working title of &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot;, but was changed to &quot;Gigantis, the Fire Monster&quot; upon its release. Schreibman took full credit for changing Godzilla&#x27;s name to Gigantis, which was an attempt to convince audiences that &quot;Gigantis&quot; was a brand new monster, stating, &quot;We called it &#x27;Gigantis&#x27; because we did not want it to be confused with &#x27;Godzilla&#x27; [who had clearly been killed irreparably by the oxygenator].&quot; At one point, Schreibman inaccurately told reporters that the original Japanese film was called &quot;Angirus&quot;.

The film was dubbed at Ryder Sound Services in New York and featured the voice talents of Keye Luke, Paul Frees, and George Takei. The English dialogue was based on a loose interpretation, rather than an accurate translation, of the original Japanese dialogue. Credit for the English dialogue script had not been revealed since the release of the film. According to Takei, the word &quot;banana oil&quot; was created by the dub&#x27;s director due to having difficulty finding a word to match the lip movement of the original Japanese word &quot;bakayaro&quot;. Takei stated that people laughed during the recording due to the word being an outdated expression. The English version utilizes stock footage from various films, such as &quot;Unknown Island&quot; and the first &quot;Godzilla&quot; film, as well as news reels, military footage, the space program, and educational films.

Prior to the film&#x27;s release, Schreibman approached Bill Foreman (then-President of Pacific Theaters) and convinced him to purchase the theatrical and television rights to both &quot;Gigantis&quot; and &quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot; and helped Foreman sell the theatrical rights to Warner Bros. According to the deal, Foreman agreed to show both films in all of his theaters while Warner Bros. would distribute the films to other theaters and were given the American and Latin American theatrical rights to both films for four years.

After the film reverted to Foreman and his attorney Harry B. Swerdlow (who became designated owner of both films because Foreman did not want his name to appear on the copyright notices), they did not pursue any interest in continuing to sell the television rights, which resulted in &quot;Gigantis the Fire Monster&quot; disappearing from American theatres and television for two decades until the rights reverted to Toho in the mid-1980s.

==Critical response==
From contemporary reviews in the United States, Joe R. Patrick of &quot;Des Moines Tribune&quot; described the film as &quot;amateurish&quot;, finding the acting to be &quot;confined primarily to facial expressions, in tight close-ups&quot; and that the film &quot;suffers most of all from dubbed-in English.&quot; The review did praise the animation of the monsters as &quot;at times very good, at other times poor,&quot; and concluded that the film was not as well made as its double feature, &quot;Rodan&quot;. Donald Willis of &quot;Variety&quot; declared the film as being &quot;inept and tedious&quot; but declared the miniature work as &quot;remarkably good&quot; specifically that scenes of &quot;the dinosaur-like animal crunching his way through houses, traffic and high-tension wires are interesting and exciting.&quot;

Film critic Glenn Erickson wrote in DVD Talk that the film was an &quot;underappreciated, action filled sequel to the original,&quot; and that although &quot;the human plot [...] is a series of forgettable scenes about two pilots and their girlfriends, material so poorly organized that it&#x27;s difficult to remember at all,&quot; the &quot;design and execution of the monster battles is quite exciting [featuring] wonderfully dynamic battle scenes with excellent optical superimposures.&quot; Writing for AllMovie, critic Bruce Eder noted that although &quot;[t]here are interesting elements to this movie, few [...] are explored adequately in the rather slipshod screenplay,&quot; that &quot;we never get far enough inside [the characters] to take advantage of the thematic material,&quot; and that &quot;the poorer special effects, plus an indifferent music score, made the movie considerably less than its predecessor.&quot; A review in TV Guide described the film as a &quot;lukewarm sequel&quot; and &quot;strictly second-rate, lacking both the drama of the first film and the goofy panache of later entries.&quot;

Ishirō Honda (director of the previous &quot;Godzilla&quot; film) noted that reviews for &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; were more positive compared to the previous film, stating that it was considered &quot;stupid&quot; by the media for a director to add &quot;ideas or themes&quot; into a science fiction film, he commented, &quot;That&#x27;s why I think that the first &quot;Godzilla&quot; was only considered a &#x27;weird&#x27; movie. That&#x27;s probably why they liked the second movie much better.&quot; Film historian Steve Ryfle noted that some writers felt that while &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954) was a metaphor for the Hiroshima bombing, &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; serves as metaphor for the Nagasaki bombing. Ryfle noted the scene of Hidemi gazing at the flames of Osaka strikes parallels with the imagery of a mushroom cloud.

<text>The Foo Fighters are an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1994. Initially founded as a one-man project by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, the band comprises vocalist/guitarist Grohl, bassist Nate Mendel, guitarist Pat Smear, guitarist Chris Shiflett, keyboardist Rami Jaffee and drummer Josh Freese. Guitarist Franz Stahl and drummers William Goldsmith and Taylor Hawkins are former members of the band.

Grohl created the Foo Fighters to release solo material after Nirvana broke up in 1994, and recorded their eponymous debut album (1995) mostly alone in six days. After the songs drew label interest, he recruited Mendel and Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, and Smear, who had played with Nirvana on tour. The band made their first public performance in February 1995, five months before the album&#x27;s release. 

Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; (1997), with Grohl re-recording most of the drum parts, and Smear departed soon afterward; they were replaced by Hawkins and Stahl, respectively. Stahl was fired before the recording of the group&#x27;s third album, &quot;There Is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; (1999), and the band briefly continued as a trio until Shiflett joined after the completion of &quot;There Is Nothing Left to Lose&quot;. The group released their fourth album, &quot;One by One&quot;, in 2002, followed by the two-disc &quot;In Your Honor&quot; (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. The Foo Fighters released their sixth album, &quot;Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace&quot;, in 2007.

For the Foo Fighters&#x27; seventh studio album, &quot;Wasting Light&quot; (2011), produced by Butch Vig, Smear returned as a full-time member, after having appeared frequently with the band since 2005. &quot;Sonic Highways&quot; (2014) was released as the soundtrack to the television miniseries directed by Grohl. &quot;Concrete and Gold&quot; (2017) was the second Foo Fighters album to top the charts in the United States and the first to feature Jaffee, their longtime session and touring keyboardist, as a full member. Their tenth album, &quot;Medicine at Midnight&quot; (2021), was the last before Hawkins&#x27; death in March 2022. He was replaced by Freese the following year. Their eleventh album, &quot;But Here We Are&quot;, was released in June 2023.

The Foo Fighters have won 15 Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album five times, making them among the most successful rock acts in Grammy history. In 2021, the band was announced as recipients of the first &quot;Global Icon&quot; award at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, their first year of eligibility.

== History ==

=== Background and first demos (1990–1994) ===
In 1990, Dave Grohl joined the grunge band Nirvana as the drummer. During tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs, but was too intimidated to share them with the band. He was &quot;in awe&quot; of the songs written by Nirvana&#x27;s frontman, Kurt Cobain. Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos and covers, and released an album of demos, &quot;Pocketwatch&quot;, under the pseudonym Late! in 1992.

Nirvana disbanded after the death of Cobain in 1994. Grohl received offers to work with various artists. Press rumors indicated he might join Pearl Jam, and he almost accepted a position as drummer in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Grohl later said: &quot;I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life. I thought that I would rather do what no one expected me to do.&quot; He instead entered Robert Lang Studios in October 1994 to record 15 of his own songs. With the exception of a guitar part on &quot;X-Static&quot;, played by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal. He completed an album&#x27;s worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback.

Grohl hoped to stay anonymous and release the recordings in a limited run under the name Foo Fighters, taken from foo fighter, a World War II term for unidentified flying objects. He hoped the name would lead listeners to assume the music was made by several people. He said later: &quot;Had I actually considered this to be a career, I probably would have called it something else, because it&#x27;s the stupidest fucking band name in the world.&quot; The demo tape circulated in the industry, creating interest among record labels.

=== Formation and debut album (1994–1995) ===
Grohl formed a band to support the album. He spoke to Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, about joining the group, but he decided against it. Grohl said it would have felt &quot;really natural&quot; for them to work together, but would have been &quot;weird&quot; for the others and place more pressure on Grohl. Instead, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both of the recently disbanded Seattle emo group Sunny Day Real Estate. Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear joined as the second guitarist. Grohl licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new label, Roswell Records.

The Foo Fighters made their live public debut on February 23, 1995, at the Jambalaya Club in Arcata, California, followed by performances at Satyricon in Portland on March 3 and the Velvet Elvis in Seattle on March 4. The show on March 3 had been part of a benefit gig for the investigation of the rape and murder of Gits singer Mia Zapata. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album. The Foo Fighters undertook their first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for Mike Watt. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;This Is a Call&quot;, was released in June 1995, and their debut album, &quot;Foo Fighters,&quot; was released the next month. &quot;I&#x27;ll Stick Around&quot;, &quot;For All the Cows&quot;, and &quot;Big Me&quot; were released as subsequent singles. The band spent the following months on tour, including their first appearance at the Reading Festival in England in August.

=== &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; (1996–1997) ===

After touring through the spring of 1996, the Foo Fighters entered Bear Creek Studio in Woodinville, Washington, with producer Gil Norton to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes to Los Angeles, intending to finish his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with the drumming and replaced most of Goldsmith&#x27;s drum tracks with his own. Though Grohl hoped that Goldsmith would still play on the tour, Goldsmith felt betrayed and left the band.
In need of a replacement for Goldsmith, Grohl contacted Alanis Morissette&#x27;s touring drummer Taylor Hawkins for a recommendation. Grohl was surprised when Hawkins volunteered himself. Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;, in May 1997. The album included the singles &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, &quot;Everlong&quot; and &quot;My Hero&quot;.

Smear left the Foo Fighters in 1997, citing exhaustion and burnout, and was replaced by Grohl&#x27;s former Scream bandmate Franz Stahl. Stahl toured with the Foo Fighters for the next few months and appeared on two tracks recorded for movie soundtracks, a re-recording of &quot;Walking After You&quot;, also released as a single, for &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;A320&quot; for &quot;Godzilla&quot;. A B-side from the &quot;My Hero&quot; single, &quot;Dear Lover&quot;, appeared in the horror film &quot;Scream 2&quot;. The tour for &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; album in 1998 included performances at Glastonbury Festival (on the main stage) and the Reading Festival.

=== &quot;There Is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; (1998–2001) ===
In 1998, the Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl&#x27;s home state of Virginia, to write their third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 1999, &quot;in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn&#x27;t.&quot; Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent several months recording the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;There Is Nothing Left to Lose&quot;, in Grohl&#x27;s home studio. The album spawned several singles, including &quot;Learn to Fly&quot;, the band&#x27;s first to reach the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Other singles included &quot;Stacked Actors&quot;, &quot;Generator&quot;, &quot;Next Year&quot;, and &quot;Breakout&quot;.

Before the release of the album, Capitol Records president Gary Gersh was forced out of the label. Given Grohl&#x27;s history with Gersh, the Foo Fighters&#x27; contract had included a &quot;key man clause&quot; that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh&#x27;s departure. They left Capitol and signed with RCA, who later acquired the rights to the band&#x27;s Capitol albums.
After recording &quot;There Is Nothing Left to Lose&quot; was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists and settled on Chris Shiflett, who performed with Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and California punk band No Use for a Name. Shiflett initially joined as a touring guitarist but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group&#x27;s fourth album.

In January 2000, Mendel led a benefit concert in Hollywood for the AIDS denialist group Alive &amp; Well AIDS Alternatives, with a speech by the founder, Christine Maggiore, and distribution of free copies of her self-published book, &quot;What If Everything You Thought You Knew About AIDS Was Wrong?&quot;. The Foo Fighters website featured a section devoted to Alive &amp; Well. Sandra Thurman, the director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, said this was &quot;extraordinarily irresponsible behavior... There is no doubt about the link between HIV and AIDS in the respected scientific community.&quot; All links and references to Alive &amp; Well were removed from the Foo Fighters website by March 2003.

Around 2001, the Foo Fighters established a relationship with the English rock band Queen, as they (particularly Grohl and Hawkins) were fans. That March, Grohl and Hawkins inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and joined them to perform the 1976 classic, &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, with Hawkins playing drums alongside Roger Taylor. The guitarist Brian May added a guitar track to the Foo Fighters&#x27; second cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Have a Cigar&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;&quot;. In 2002, May contributed guitar to &quot;Tired of You&quot; and the outtake &quot;Knucklehead&quot;. The Foo Fighters and Queen have performed together on several occasions since, including VH1 Rock Honors and the Foo Fighters&#x27; headlining concert in Hyde Park.

=== &quot;One by One&quot; (2001–2004) ===

Near the end of 2001, the Foo Fighters reconvened to record their fourth album. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio, the album &quot;just didn&#x27;t sound right&quot; and the band had no confidence it would sell well. With the album not reaching their expectations amid much infighting, Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the Stone Age complete their 2002 album &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;. Once that album was finished and touring had started for both the Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely. Grohl reunited with Hawkins, Shiflett, and Mendel to play the Coachella Festival, alternating days with Queens of the Stone Age. Hawkins and Grohl talked about resuming work on &quot;One by One&quot; and after a very satisfying performance the following day, they agreed to stay together. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album in a ten-day stretch at Grohl&#x27;s home studio in Alexandria, Virginia, the following month. The original version of &quot;One by One&quot;, referred to by the band as Million Dollar Demos, has never been released in its entirety although seven tracks were leaked online in 2012 and 2015.

The album was released in October 2002 under the title &quot;One by One&quot;. Singles from the album included &quot;All My Life&quot;, &quot;Times Like These&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, and &quot;Have It All&quot;. The tour for the album included a headline performance at the 2002 Reading and Leeds Festivals.

For most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004, upon learning that George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign was using &quot;Times Like These&quot; at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to John Kerry&#x27;s campaign, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s no way of stopping the president playing your songs, so I went out and played it for John Kerry&#x27;s people instead, where I thought the message would kinda make more sense.&quot; Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets. The entire band joined Grohl for a performance in Arizona coinciding with one of the presidential debates.

=== &quot;In Your Honor&quot; (2005–2006) ===

Having spent a year and a half touring behind &quot;One by One&quot;, Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record. Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself but eventually the project involved the entire band. To record its fifth album, the band shifted to Los Angeles and built a recording studio, dubbed Studio 606 West. Grohl insisted that the album be divided into two discs – one full of rock songs, and the other featuring all acoustic tracks. &quot;In Your Honor&quot; was released in June 2005. The album&#x27;s singles included &quot;Best of You&quot;, &quot;DOA&quot;, &quot;Resolve&quot;, and &quot;No Way Back/Cold Day in the Sun&quot;.

During September and October 2005, the band toured with Weezer on what was billed as the Foozer Tour. The Foo Fighters played a headline performance at the 2005 Reading and Leeds Festivals. On June 17, 2006, the Foo Fighters performed their largest non-festival headlining concert to date at London&#x27;s Hyde Park. Motörhead&#x27;s Lemmy joined the band on stage to sing &quot;Shake Your Blood&quot; from Dave Grohl&#x27;s &quot;Probot&quot; album. As a surprise performance, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen appeared to play part of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; as a lead in to &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;.

In further support of &quot;In Your Honor&quot;, the band organized a short acoustic tour for the summer of 2006. Members who had performed with them in late 2005 appeared, such as Pat Smear, Petra Haden on violin and backing vocals, Drew Hester on percussion, and Rami Jaffee of the Wallflowers on keyboard and piano. While much of the setlist focused on &quot;In Your Honor&quot;″s acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs, such as &quot;Ain&#x27;t It The Life&quot;, &quot;Floaty&quot;, and &quot;See You&quot;. The band also performed &quot;Marigold&quot;, a &quot;Pocketwatch&quot;-era song that was best known as a Nirvana B-side.

In November 2006, the band released their first live CD, &quot;Skin and Bones&quot;, featuring fifteen performances captured over a three-night stint in Los Angeles.

=== &quot;Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace&quot; (2007–2009) ===
For the follow-up to &quot;In Your Honor&quot;, the band recruited &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot; producer Gil Norton. &quot;Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace&quot; was released on September 25, 2007. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Pretender&quot;, was issued to radio in early August. In mid-to-late 2007 &quot;The Pretender&quot; topped &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock chart for a record 19 weeks. The second single, &quot;Long Road to Ruin&quot;, was released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator Jesse Peretz (formerly of the Lemonheads). Other singles included &quot;Let It Die&quot; and &quot;Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)&quot;.

In October 2007, the Foo Fighters started their world tour in support of the album. The band performed shows throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia, including headlining the Virgin Mobile Festival in Baltimore on August 9. At the European MTV Music Awards in 2007, Pat Smear confirmed his return to the band in a touring capacity.

&quot;Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace&quot; was nominated for five Grammy Awards in 2008. The Foo Fighters won Best Rock Album and Best Hard Rock Performance (for &quot;The Pretender&quot;). The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, while &quot;The Pretender&quot; was also nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rock Song.
On June 7, 2008, the band played Wembley Stadium, London, and was joined by Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin to play &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; (with Grohl on drums and Hawkins on vocals) and &quot;Ramble On&quot; (sung by Grohl, drums by Hawkins). As Page and Jones left the stage before a final encore of &quot;Best of You&quot;, an ecstatic Grohl shouted &quot;Welcome to the greatest fucking day of my whole entire life!&quot;. Throughout the tour for &quot;Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace&quot;, the Foo Fighters had been writing and practicing new songs at sound checks. After the Foo Fighters had completed this tour in September 2008, they recorded 13 new songs in Studio 606, shortly after announcing a hiatus from touring (which would last until January 2011). These sessions likely lasted from late 2008 – early 2009. While the members of the Foo Fighters had initially planned for their new album (composed of songs from this recording session) to have come out in 2009 with almost no touring support, they ultimately decided to shelve most of the songs from these sessions. Three of these songs were later released — &quot;Wheels&quot; and &quot;Word Forward&quot; (on their 2009 compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;); and a newly recorded version of &quot;Rope&quot; (which ended up making the final cut of &quot;Wasting Light&quot;).

=== &quot;Wasting Light&quot; (2010–2012) ===
In August 2010, the band began recording their seventh studio album with producer Butch Vig, who had previously produced the two new tracks for the band&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. The album was recorded in Dave Grohl&#x27;s garage using only analog equipment. The album won five Grammys and was nominated for six. The recording was analog to tape and used no computers, not even to mix or master. Vig said in an interview with MTV that the album was entirely analog until post-mastering. Pat Smear was present in many photos posted by Grohl on Twitter, and a press release in December confirmed Smear played on every track on the album and was considered an official member of the band once again.

The first single from &quot;Wasting Light&quot;, &quot;Rope&quot;, was released to radio in February 2011. On April 16, 2011, the Foo Fighters released an album of covers, &quot;Medium Rare&quot;, as a limited-edition vinyl for Record Store Day. The promotion for the album was highly praised for its originality. &quot;Wasting Light&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, becoming the band&#x27;s first album to do so. Other singles for the album included &quot;Walk&quot;, &quot;Arlandria&quot;, &quot;These Days&quot;, and &quot;Bridge Burning&quot;.

Alongside &quot;Wasting Light&quot;″s release, the Foo Fighters released a rockumentary, directed by Academy Award-winner James Moll. The film, titled &quot;Back and Forth&quot;, chronicles the band&#x27;s career. Then current and past members, and producer Butch Vig, tell the story of the band through interviews. After debuting on March 15, 2011, at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, it was released on DVD three months later.

On May 21, 2011, the Foo Fighters headlined the middle day of the Hangout Music Festival in Gulf Shores, Alabama. On June 4, 2011, they played a surprise set at the 2011 KROQ Weenie Roast. They also headlined two sold-out shows at the Milton Keynes National Bowl on July 2 and 3, joined on stage by artists such as Alice Cooper, Seasick Steve, and John Paul Jones. They headlined the final night at the 20th anniversary of Lollapalooza in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park on August 7, 2011, performing part of their set in a driving rainstorm.
In September 2011 before a show in Kansas City, the band performed a parody song in front of a protest by the Westboro Baptist Church. It mocked the church&#x27;s opposition to homosexuality and was performed in the same faux-trucker garb that was seen in the band&#x27;s Hot Buns promotional video.

It was announced on September 28, 2011, that the Foo Fighters would be performing during the closing ceremony of Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s annual video game convention, BlizzCon.

On August 27, 2012, the Foo Fighters ended their European tour with a headline performance at Reading and Leeds Festival. On September 5, the band performed a show at the Fillmore in Charlotte, North Carolina, as a benefit for Rock the Vote. The show, which occurred at the same time as the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, was announced only two weeks prior. Tickets to the 2000-person capacity venue sold out in under 60 seconds, setting a record for the site. The band set another personal record during the show itself, being the longest that the band had played to date at just under 3.5 hours with a setlist of 36 songs. On September 21, the band headlined the Music Midtown Festival in Atlanta, Georgia. The following evening, they headlined the DeLuna Festival in Pensacola Beach, Florida. On September 29, the band performed at the Global Citizens&#x27; Festival before embarking on a break.

=== &quot;Sonic Highways&quot; and &quot;Saint Cecilia&quot; EP (2013–2015) ===
Despite initially announcing a break after supporting &quot;Wasting Light&quot;, Grohl stated in January 2013 that the band had started writing material for an eighth studio album. On February 20, 2013, at the Brit Awards, Grohl said he was resuming work on the album the following day.

On September 6, 2013, Shiflett posted a photo to his Instagram account that indicated 13 songs were being recorded and later described it as &quot;pretty fucking fun&quot;. Rami Jaffee has recorded parts for two songs, one of which was &quot;In the Clear&quot;. Butch Vig, who worked with the band on &quot;Wasting Light&quot;, confirmed via Twitter in late August 2013 that he was producing the album. The band confirmed that it would end its hiatus by playing two shows in Mexico City on December 11 and 13. On October 31, a video appeared on the official Foo Fighters YouTube channel showing a motorcyclist, later revealed to be Erik Estrada, delivering each of the band members an invitation to play in Mexico.

On January 16, 2014, a picture was posted to the Foo Fighters&#x27; Facebook page with several master tapes labeled LP 8. On May 15, it was announced that the album would be released in November and that the Foo Fighters would commemorate the album and their 20th anniversary with an HBO TV series directed by Grohl titled &quot;Sonic Highways&quot;. Eight songs were written and recorded in eight studios in eight different American cities with video capturing the history and feel of each town. On July 30, Butch Vig revealed that the Foo Fighters had finished recording and mixing the album and that it was slated to be released a month after the premiere of the TV show.

In June 2014, the band agreed to play a show in Richmond, Virginia, that was entirely crowd-funded by fans on the website Tilt.com. The show took place on September 17 before 1,500 fans. The band played 23 songs over the course of two and a half hours. The Foo Fighters announced their tour would include performances in Cape Town on December 10 and Johannesburg on December 13. The band played three performances under the alias The Holy Shits in September 2014; the first at the Concorde 2 club in Brighton, England, where Grohl invited lead singer Jay Apperley of the tribute band UK Foo Fighters on stage to sing, followed by the House of Vans and the Islington Assembly Hall. On September 14, 2014, the band performed at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games, their first official show in England since closing Reading Festival in 2012. They closed out the 2014 VooDoo Music and Arts Festival in New Orleans on November 2, 2014, in a two and a half hour performance that included an appearance from New Orleans native Trombone Shorty, who played &quot;This Is a Call&quot; with the band.

On August 8, the band released a short clip of their latest work, titled 8. On August 11, the band announced that the new album would be titled &quot;Sonic Highways&quot; and released on November 10, 2014. An international tour, dubbed the &quot;Sonic Highways World Tour&quot;, followed with performances in South Africa in December and South America in January 2015. It continued to Australia and New Zealand in February and March.

On May 20, 2015, the Foo Fighters were the final musical act to perform on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, continuing their long association with the host as he wrapped up his 33-year career in late-night television. The show ended with a montage of Letterman highlights while the Foo Fighters played &quot;Everlong&quot;, which Letterman said had significant meaning for him after his open-heart surgery in 2000, introducing them as &quot;my favorite band, playing my favorite song.&quot; The band postponed their international tour to make the appearance; the tour resumed on May 24, with a performance at Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend in Norwich, England.

On June 12, Grohl fell from the stage in Gothenburg, Sweden, during the group&#x27;s second song, breaking his leg. The band continued playing while Grohl received medical attention, who then returned to the stage to finish the last two hours of the band&#x27;s set from a chair while a medic tended to his leg. After the concert, Grohl was flown to London for surgery, requiring six metal pins to stabilize the fracture. As a result of the injury, the band canceled its remaining European tour dates.

In July, one thousand Italian fans held the Rockin&#x27; 1000 gathering in Cesena, Italy, performing &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; and asking the Foo Fighters to come play in the town. The performance video went viral and impressed Grohl, resulting in the band appearing in Cesena on November 3.
The Foo Fighters planned to follow their international tour with a North American tour to promote &quot;Sonic Highways&quot;, beginning with a special Fourth of July event in Washington, D.C., that would commemorate the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The all-day event was to be held at Washington&#x27;s RFK Stadium featuring performances by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Heart, LL Cool J, Gary Clark Jr., and Buddy Guy. Dave Grohl&#x27;s injury initially led to speculation that the band would drop out of the event but they later confirmed they would perform; however, the injury did prevent them from headlining the 2015 Glastonbury Festival. The band performed for 48,000 people with Grohl in a custom-built moving throne which he claimed to have designed himself while on painkillers.

Beginning with the show on July 4, the Foo Fighters re-branded the North American tour as the Broken Leg Tour. The band continued to use the name at later North American performances. Prior to their August 21 concert at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri, the band rickrolled protesting members of the Westboro Baptist Church, as they had also done in 2011.

On November 23, 2015, a surprise release following a month-long countdown clock on the Foo Fighters&#x27; website revealed the free EP &quot;Saint Cecilia&quot;, including a single of the same name. Alongside its release, Grohl announced that the band would be going on an indefinite hiatus.

=== &quot;Concrete and Gold&quot; (2016–2019) ===

In response to growing rumors of a breakup, the Foo Fighters released a mockumentary video in March 2016 portraying Grohl leaving the band to pursue electronic music and Nick Lachey (formerly of 98 Degrees) becoming the group&#x27;s new singer, ending with: &quot;For the millionth time, we&#x27;re not breaking up. And nobody&#x27;s going fucking solo!&quot;

Grohl announced that the Foo Fighters would spend much of 2017 recording their ninth studio album. On June 1, 2017, their new single &quot;Run&quot; was released. It topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Songs chart the following month. The band confirmed touring keyboardist Rami Jaffee was officially the sixth member of the group. On June 20, 2017, the band announced that their new album, &quot;Concrete and Gold&quot;, would be released in September. On August 23, 2017, &quot;The Sky Is a Neighborhood&quot; was released as the second single and topped the Mainstream Rock chart. The Line was released in promotion of the album and later as the third single in 2018. &quot;Concrete and Gold&quot; was officially released on September 15, 2017, produced by Greg Kurstin. The album is noted as deriving influence from Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and the Beatles. &quot;Concrete and Gold&quot; also features Justin Timberlake on vocals for &quot;Make It Right&quot;, Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men on backing vocals for the song &quot;Concrete and Gold&quot;, and Paul McCartney on the drums for &quot;Sunday Rain&quot;. The band began touring in June 2017, including headlining the Glastonbury Festival 2017. The tour in support of &quot;Concrete and Gold&quot; was extended to October 2018.

=== &quot;Medicine at Midnight&quot; and &quot;Studio 666&quot; (2019–2022) ===

In October 2019, the band announced that they were recording their tenth studio album based on demos by Grohl. In November 2019, the band began releasing a series of EPs under the umbrella name of the &quot;Foo Files&quot;, largely consisting of previously released B sides and live performances. By February 2020, Grohl announced that the new album was complete but by May, it was delayed indefinitely because of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve kind of shelved it for now to figure out exactly when it&#x27;s going to happen.&quot;

Starting in November 2020, promotion for the album ramped up. Its title, &quot;Medicine at Midnight&quot;, and release date, February 5, 2021, were announced. The band released three singles ahead of the album: &quot;Shame Shame&quot;, &quot;No Son of Mine&quot;, and &quot;Waiting on a War&quot;. In January, the band performed at the US Presidential Inauguration of Joe Biden.

On February 10, 2021, the Foo Fighters were announced as one of the 2021 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees in their first year of eligibility as their debut album had been released 25 years prior. On May 12, 2021, the Foo Fighters were announced as one of six performer inductees. For Record Store Day on July 17, 2021, the Foo Fighters released an album of disco covers, &quot;Hail Satin&quot;, under the name Dee Gees. The album contains four Bee Gees covers, a cover of Andy Gibb&#x27;s &quot;Shadow Dancing&quot;, plus five live versions of &quot;Medicine at Midnight&quot; tracks.

On February 25, 2022, the Foo Fighters released a comedy horror film, &quot;Studio 666&quot;, directed by BJ McDonnell. It stars the band members as themselves, alongside Will Forte, Whitney Cummings, Jeff Garlin, and Jenna Ortega. In the film, Grohl is possessed by a demonic spirit and kills the other band members while they record in a haunted mansion. It was filmed in the same mansion in which the Foo Fighters had recorded &quot;Medicine at Midnight&quot;. &quot;Studio 666&quot; received mixed reviews and performed poorly in its opening week. Grohl released an EP of songs from the film, &quot;Dream Widow&quot;, on March 25, 2022.

=== Death of Hawkins and &quot;But Here We Are&quot; (2022–present) ===

On March 25, 2022, Hawkins died in his room at the Casa Medina hotel in Bogotá, Colombia. No cause of death was given. Hawkins had suffered chest pain, and had ten substances in his system at the time of his death, including opioids, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis. His last performance with the Foo Fighters was at Lollapalooza Argentina on March 20, 2022, in Buenos Aires.

On the night of his death, the Foo Fighters were scheduled to perform at the Estéreo Picnic Festival as part of their South American tour; the festival stage was turned into a candlelight vigil for Hawkins. A few days later, the band canceled their remaining tour dates. In September, the Foo Fighters performed tribute concerts to Hawkins at Wembley Stadium, London, and the Kia Forum, Los Angeles. Josh Freese played drums at both concerts. Shane Hawkins, Taylor&#x27;s 16-year-old son, played drums on &quot;My Hero&quot; at Wembley.
In January 2023, the Foo Fighters began announcing festival appearances for the year. On May 21, in a humorous video featuring several celebrity drummers, they announced Freese as their new drummer. The Foo Fighters&#x27; eleventh studio album, &quot;But Here We Are&quot;, was released on June 2, featuring the single &quot;Rescued&quot;. A press release described the album as a &quot;brutally honest and emotionally raw response to everything Foo Fighters endured over the last year&quot;. The Foo Fighters made a surprise appearance at Glastonbury Festival 2023, their first Glastonbury performance since headlining in 2017. They as well as playing the same stage, night and spot as their Glastonbury debut 25 years earlier.

In August 2024, the Foo Fighters announced that they would donate all royalties earned from their single &quot;My Hero&quot; to Kamala Harris&#x27; presidential campaign after her running opponent, Donald Trump, used the song without permission at a rally. In September 2024, after Grohl announced that he had fathered a child outside his marriage, the Foo Fighters canceled their headline performance at that month&#x27;s Soundside Music Festival in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

== Musical style and influences ==

The Foo Fighters have been described as alternative rock, post-grunge, hard rock, grunge, power pop, and pop rock. They were initially compared to Grohl&#x27;s previous group, Nirvana. Grohl acknowledged that Kurt Cobain was an influence on his songwriting: &quot;Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that&#x27;s stripped down.&quot; The Foo Fighters also used the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana &quot;liking The Knack, Bay City Rollers, Beatles, and ABBA as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag, I suppose.&quot; When comparing the legacies of the two bands, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said the Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;may not be anywhere near as glamorous or as era-defining as that of [Nirvana], but in a way, it&#x27;s much more difficult and thankless&quot;. The publication would also call Grohl and the band &quot;excellent at being mainstream&quot; and being &quot;his generation&#x27;s answer to Tom Petty—a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock.&quot;

Writing and recording songs for their first album by himself, Grohl intended for the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his drumming, assigning various drum parts to strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, &quot;I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.&quot; Once Grohl assembled a full band, the members assisted in song arrangements.

The band members meld melodic and heavy elements. Grohl noted in 1997, &quot;We all love music, whether it&#x27;s the Beatles or Queen or punk rock. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we&#x27;re all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.&quot; Grohl said in 2005, &quot;I love being in a rock band, but I don&#x27;t know if I necessarily wanna be in an alternative rock band from the 1990s for the rest of my life.&quot; Grohl noted that the band&#x27;s acoustic tour was an attempt to broaden the group&#x27;s sound.

They won five of the six, losing only to Adele in the Album of the Year category.

In September 2021, the band received the first Global Icon Award at that year&#x27;s MTV Video Music Awards. The following month, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility.

<text>Abel Meeropol (February 10, 1903 – October 29, 1986) was an American songwriter and poet whose works were published under his pseudonym Lewis Allan. He wrote the poem and musical setting of &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (1937), which was recorded by Billie Holiday.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Meeropol was born in 1903 to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants in the Bronx, New York. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1921 (his classmate Countee Cullen graduated in 1922); he earned a B.A. from City College of New York and an M.A. from Harvard University. He taught English at DeWitt Clinton for 17 years. During his tenure as a high school teacher, Meeropol taught author and racial justice advocate James Baldwin.

===Song writing and poetry===
Meeropol wrote the anti-lynching poem &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (1937), first published as &quot;Bitter Fruit&quot; in a teacher union publication. He later set it to music. The song was recorded and performed by Billie Holiday and Nina Simone. Holiday notes in the book &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot; that she co-wrote the music to the song with Meeropol and Sonny White. The writers David Margolick and Hilton Als dismissed that claim in their work &quot;Strange Fruit: The Biography of a Song&quot;, writing that hers was &quot;an account that may set a record for most misinformation per column inch&quot;. When challenged, Holiday—whose autobiography had been ghostwritten by William Dufty—claimed, &quot;I ain&#x27;t never read that book.&quot;
Meeropol wrote numerous other poems and songs, including the Frank Sinatra and Josh White hit &quot;The House I Live In.&quot; He also wrote the libretto of Robert Kurka&#x27;s opera &quot;The Good Soldier Schweik&quot;, which was premiered in 1958 by the New York City Opera.

According to his adopted son Robert Meeropol, the songs &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; and &quot;The House I Live In,&quot; along with the Peggy Lee hit &quot;Apples, Peaches and Cherries,&quot; provided most of the royalty income of the family. &quot;Apples, Peaches and Cherries&quot; was translated into French by Sacha Distel and became a number one hit in France under the title &quot;Scoubidou.&quot; Meeropol filed a copyright infringement lawsuit over Distel&#x27;s plagiarism as Distel initially had claimed the song as his. After the case was settled, Meeropol started receiving the royalties.

Meeropol published his work under the pseudonym of &quot;Lewis Allan&quot; in memory of the names of his two stillborn children.

==Personal life==
Meeropol was a member of the American Communist Party from 1932 to 1947. He was sympathetic to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted and executed for espionage. Later, he and his wife Anne adopted the Rosenbergs&#x27; two sons, Michael and Robert, who were orphaned after their parents&#x27; executions. Both children took the surname &quot;Meeropol.&quot;

==Death==
Meeropol died October 30, 1986, at the Jewish Nursing Home in Longmeadow, Massachusetts.

<text>BBC Radio Stoke is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving Staffordshire and South Cheshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, Freeview and via BBC Sounds from studios in the Hanley area of Stoke-on-Trent.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 118,000 listeners and an 8.9% share as of December 2023.

==Overview==
The station began broadcasting on 14 March 1968 as &quot;BBC Radio Stoke-on-Trent&quot;.

Both of the English counties the station covers have no BBC local radio station for their whole area. In Staffordshire, the south is covered by BBC Radio WM, and the east by BBC Radio Derby. In Cheshire, north-western areas are served by BBC Radio Merseyside and the north-east by BBC Radio Manchester. The BBC has mooted at the possibility of launching a stand-alone station for Cheshire, but they have never been taken forward.

The station broadcasts from its studios on Cheapside in Hanley, the biggest of the six towns that make up the city of Stoke-on-Trent. There are also studios and offices in Crewe, Leek and Stafford.

The current Managing Editors are Alistair Miskin and Tim Beech.

==Technical==
Radio Stoke transmits on 94.6 MHz FM from the Alsagers Bank transmitter, which is two miles west of Newcastle-under-Lyme, close to the M6. The signal is clear in most of the area, except in some parts of the Staffordshire Moorlands (Cheadle in particular) and Stafford (which has its own relay).

The 104.1 MHz FM frequency is heard in Stafford and the transmitter is on the roof of the County Education building in the town.

DAB signals come from the Stoke &amp; Stafford 12D multiplex from Alsagers Bank, Pye Green (near Hednesford), Sutton Common (between Congleton and Macclesfield in Cheshire), and Tick Hill (strongest power, south-east of the junction of the A520 and A52 near the Foxfield Steam Railway between Cookshill and Godleybrook). The Sideway transmitter is right next to the A500 D Road, just south of the A50 junction.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 715 in the BBC West Midlands and BBC North West regions and streams online via BBC Sounds.

===FM tuning details===
==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Stoke-on-Trent studios from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day.

The station&#x27;s late show, airing from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., originates from BBC Radio WM in Birmingham.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio Stoke simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

<doc id="570302" wikidata="Q78522" url="?curid=570302" title="Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf">
<text>Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf (2 November 1739 – 24 October 1799) was an Austrian composer and violinist. He was a friend of both Haydn and Mozart. His best-known works include the German singspiel &quot;Doktor und Apotheker&quot; and a number of programmatic symphonies based on Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses.

== Life ==

=== 1739–1764 ===

Dittersdorf was born in the Laimgrube (now Mariahilf) district of Vienna, Austria, as Johann Carl Ditters. His father was a military tailor in the Austrian Imperial Army of Charles VI, for a number of German-speaking regiments. After retiring honorably from his military obligation, he was provided with royal letters of reference and a sinecure with the Imperial Theatre. In 1745, the six-year-old August Carl was introduced to the violin and his father&#x27;s moderate financial position allowed him not only a good general education at a Jesuit school, but private tutelage in music, violin, French and religion. After leaving his first teacher, Carl studied violin with J. Ziegler, who by 1750, through his influence, secured his pupil&#x27;s appointment as a violinist in the orchestra of the Benedictine church on the Freyung.

Prince Joseph of Saxe-Hildburghausen soon noticed young Ditters, and on 1 March 1751 hired him for his court orchestra. Under princely auspices he studied violin with Francesco Trani who, impressed with the ability of his pupil in composition, commended him to Giuseppe Bonno who instructed him in Fuxian counterpoint and free composition. After a few years Prince Joseph disbanded the orchestra, since he had to leave Vienna to assume the regency in Hildburghausen, and the Austrian Empress hired Dittersdorf for her own orchestra through Count Durazzo, Theatre Director at the Imperial Court. In 1761 he was engaged as violinist in the Imperial Theatre orchestra, and in 1762 as its conductor. It was during this period that he became acquainted with Christoph Willibald Gluck, who had just achieved greatness as an opera composer with the Vienna première of his &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;. In 1763 he traveled to Bologna with Gluck to see the opera &quot;Il trionfo di Clelia&quot;, an Italian tour that was to leave the greatest impression on his future work as a composer from both the Austrian Gluck and the contemporary Italian musical scene. In 1764 he traveled to Paris, a trip with only scarce and uncertain documentation. Back in Vienna in 1764, his contract with Count Durazzo expired that winter, but he met the great Joseph Haydn and became one of his closest friends.

=== 1764–1774 ===
In 1764, Dittersdorf assumed the post of Kapellmeister at the court of Ádám Patachich, Hungarian nobleman and Bishop of Nagyvárad (Oradea, Romania). The following year he was introduced to Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch, the Prince-Bishop of Breslau, who was in the process of creating a cultural centre around his court based at Château Jánský vrch (Johannesberg) in Javorník (today part of the Czech Republic). He accepted the post of Hofkomponist (court composer) in 1771, and it was during his tenure at Johannesberg that most of his creative output was produced. Over the next twenty years he wrote symphonies, string quartets and other chamber music, and opere buffe. In 1773 the prince-bishop appointed him &quot;Amtshauptmann&quot; of nearby Jeseník (Freiwaldau), one of several measures to help entice the cosmopolitan composer to remain at isolated Johannesberg. Since this new post required a noble title, Ditters was sent to Vienna and given the noble title of &quot;von Dittersdorf&quot;. His full surname thus became &quot;Ditters von Dittersdorf&quot;, but he is usually referred to simply as &quot;Dittersdorf&quot;.

=== Final years ===
Johann Baptist Wanhal was perhaps Dittersdorf&#x27;s most eminent pupil. About 1785, Haydn, Dittersdorf, Mozart and Wanhal played string quartets together, Dittersdorf taking first violin, Haydn second violin, Mozart viola and Wanhal cello. Eminent Irish tenor Michael Kelly noted of their performance of Stephen Storace&#x27;s String Quartet that, although they played well, their performance as a whole was not outstanding; but the image of four of the greatest composers of their time joining in common music-making remains an unforgettable vignette of the Classical era (comprising the second half of the eighteenth century).

In 1794, after twenty-four years at Johannesberg, Dittersdorf, after a serious clash with von Schaffgotsch, was expelled from his palace. Sometime the following year, he was invited by Baron Ignaz von Stillfried to live in his spare château known as Červená Lhota, in southern Bohemia. His final decade was occupied with overseeing operatic productions in addition to compiling and editing his own music for publication.
He died at Nový Dvůr (Neuhof, or &quot;New Court&quot;) where Château Červená Lhota stood, and was buried in the town of Deštná. He finished his autobiography just three days before his death.

== Style and fame ==
Ditters&#x27; early work laid the groundwork for his later compositions. His symphonic and chamber compositions greatly emphasize sensuous Italo-Austrian melody instead of motivic development, which is often entirely lacking in his works. After some early Italian opere buffe, he turned to writing German Singspiele instead, with &quot;Der Apotheker und der Doktor&quot; (1786, generally known today as &quot;Doktor und Apotheker&quot;) in particular being a tremendous success in his lifetime, playing in houses all over Europe and recorded almost two centuries later. Among his 120-or-so symphonies are twelve programmatic ones based on Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, although only six have survived (and have also been recorded). He also wrote oratorios, cantatas and concertos (among which are two for double bass and one for viola), string quartets and other chamber music, piano pieces and other miscellaneous works. His memoirs, &quot;Lebenbeschreibung&quot; (&quot;Description of [My] Life&quot;), were published in Leipzig in 1801. Some of his compositions, including the double bass concerto, were published in Leipzig by the Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag.

<text>BBC Radio WM is the BBC&#x27;s local 
radio station serving the West Midlands.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at The Mailbox in Birmingham.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 193,000 listeners and a 2.2% share as of December 2023.

==History==

The station launched as BBC Radio Birmingham on 9 November 1970 and on 23 November 1981, the station changed its name to BBC WM to reflect that the station broadcasts to a wider area than just Birmingham. This date also saw the station launch a second MW transmitter to improve MW reception in Birmingham.

A short-lived service called WM Heartlands ran between early 1989 and 1991 serving the &#x27;Heartlands&#x27; area of East Birmingham using the 1458 medium wave frequency. It ran as an experiment, opting out from 8 am until 12 am. Further wavelength splitting took place later in 1989 when on 30 October 1989, the BBC Asian Network launched as a part time service on MW and in 1996, the Asian Network became a full time service. Consequently, at this point, BBC WM stopped broadcasting on MW.

In the 1990s, as an economic measure, BBC WM took over BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire in Coventry and Warwickshire. On 3 September 2005, CWR resumed the production of separate programming between 5 am and 10 pm each weekday (6 am to 6 pm at weekends).

Until 2004, BBC WM was broadcast from the Pebble Mill studios, in Edgbaston. On 4 July that year, the station moved to the new BBC Birmingham city centre offices in The Mailbox. Its facilities include two broadcast studios, a talk studio, an operations and production area, and a studio shared with the BBC Asian Network.

===BBC Radio Wolverhampton===

On 15 January 2021, BBC Radio Wolverhampton launched as a temporary sister station. The service provided eight hours of opt-out programming for listeners in Wolverhampton and the surrounding area each weekday until 31 March 2021.

==Technical==
The service is broadcast across the West Midlands on 95.6 FM and DAB from the Sutton Coldfield transmitting station situated north of Birmingham. 

It also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 714 in the BBC West Midlands region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

The county of Staffordshire does not have its own designated BBC Local Radio so it is served by 3 different stations: mid and north Staffordshire is served by BBC Radio Stoke, East Staffordshire is served by BBC Radio Derby and south Staffordshire is served by BBC Radio WM.

==Programming==

Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Birmingham studios from 6 am to 10 pm on Mondays to Saturdays and from 6 am to 6 pm on Sundays.

Off-peak programming, including the late show from 10 pm to 1 am, is simulcast across all BBC Local Radio stations across England.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC Radio WM simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live
