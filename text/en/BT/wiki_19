* January 3
** Flying an F4U Corsair, United States Marine Corps ace Gregory &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington is shot down over Rapopo Airfield, New Britain, with 24 kills to his credit. Thought to have died, he received a &quot;posthumous&quot; Medal of Honor on 15 March; in fact, he survives and spent 20 months as a prisoner-of-war at Rabaul and in Japan.
** When a German Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter shoots off part of the right wing of the U.S. Army Air Forces B-17F Flying Fortress &quot;Snap! Crackle! Pop!&quot; over Saint-Nazaire, France, sending the burning bomber into a fatal spin, its ball turret gunner, Staff Sergeant Alan Magee, jumps or is thrown from the plane without a parachute and falls four miles (6.4 km), plunging through the glass ceiling of the Saint-Nazaire train station. He miraculously survives, and spends the rest of World War II as a prisoner of war.
** Amid snow squalls and strong, gusting winds that had grounded all other aircraft in the area, United States Coast Guard Commander Frank A. Erickson pilots a Sikorsky HNS-1 helicopter from Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York, to Battery Park in Manhattan, where he picks up two cases containing over 40 units of blood plasma that are lashed to the helicopter&#x27;s floats. He then flies on to deliver the plasma to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, where it is used to treat survivors from the United States Navy destroyer , which had capsized and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean off New York Harbor that morning after a series of violent internal explosions.

<text>Joanna Gash (born 21 July 1944) is an Australian former politician who served as a member of the House of Representatives representing the Division of Gilmore for the Liberal Party from 1996 to 2013.

In 2012, Gash was directly elected as Mayor of Shoalhaven in the south-eastern coastal region of New South Wales. In 2016, she lost the mayoralty to Greens candidate Amanda Findley.

==Personal life==
Gash was born in Groningen in the Netherlands, and emigrated to Australia when she was six. She was educated at Institute of Administration in Sydney. Before entering politics she was a Regional Manager with the Tourism Commission of New South Wales, a guest house co-proprietor, and a Councillor of the Wingecarribee Shire Council. She was for many years a scripture and Sunday School teacher and spent many weekends at the Church of England Camps at the Port Hacking River (Camp Howard).

==Political career==
Gash was elected to Federal Parliament at the 1996 federal election. In January 2012, she announced that she would not be contesting the next federal election. At the same time, she announced her intention to stand for the mayoral position at the Shoalhaven City Council elections, due to be held in September 2012. Gash was successful, winning the directly elected role with 63.19% of the vote. She also led a ticket that saw nine other Councillors elected to the thirteenmember Shoalhaven City Council. Following her election as mayor, there was criticism about her constitutional ability to hold office as a federal Member of Parliament and to hold an office of profit under the crown, as Mayor. Gash vigorously defended her position.

She sought re-election as mayor of City of Shoalhaven at the 2016 NSW Local Council Elections, but lost her position following a massive swing, which saw her lose about half of the vote she won at the 2012 election. Amanda Findley of the Australian Greens was elected as mayor, with Gash being elected as a Ward 2 councillor.

In the 2019 federal election contest for the seat of Gilmore, which she formerly represented, Gash, together with her successor Ann Sudmalis, endorsed the National Party candidate Katrina Hodgkinson over the Prime Minister Scott Morrison&#x27;s &quot;captain&#x27;s pick&quot; candidate for the Liberal Party, Warren Mundine. The seat was the only one gained by the Labor Party in the election.

==Honours and awards==
In 2017, Gash was appointed a member of the Order of Australia for significant service to the Parliament of Australia, to local government, and to the community of the Shoalhaven.

<doc id="565994" wikidata="Q1955000" url="?curid=565994" title="Music of the Gambia">
<text>The music of [[the Gambia]] is closely linked musically with that of its neighbor, Senegal, which surrounds its inland frontiers completely. Among its prominent musicians is Foday Musa Suso. &quot;Mbalax&quot; is a widely known popular dance music of the Gambia and neighbouring Senegal. It fuses popular Western music and dance, with &quot;sabar&quot;, the traditional drumming and dance music of the Wolof and Serer people.

==National music==
&quot;For The Gambia Our Homeland&quot;, the national anthem of the Gambia, was composed by Jeremy Frederic Howe, based on the traditional Mandinka song &quot;Foday Kaba Dumbuya&quot;, with words by Virginia Julia Howe, for an international competition to produce an anthem (and flag) before independence from the United Kingdom in 1965.

==Traditional music==

The Gambia, the smallest country in mainland Africa, is an independent coastal state along the River Gambia. It gained its separate identity as a colony of the United Kingdom while Senegal was a colony of France, but the two countries&#x27; traditional music are very much intertwined. Among Gambia&#x27;s people, who together number some 1.728 million (2010), 42% are Mandinka, 18% Fula, 16% Wolof\Serer, 10% Jola and 9% Soninke, the remainder being 4% other African and 1% non-African (2003). 63% of Gambians live in rural villages (1993 census), though the population is young and tends towards urbanization. 90% are Muslims and most of the remainder Christians.

&quot;Griots&quot;, also known as &quot;jelis&quot;, hereditary praise-singers, a legacy of the Mande Empire, are common throughout the region. Gambian &quot;griots&quot;, as elsewhere, often play the &quot;kora&quot;, a 21 string harp. The region of Brikama has produced some famous musicians, including Foday Musa Suso, who founded the Mandingo Griot Society in New York City in the 1970s, bringing Mande music to the New York avant-garde scene and collaborating with Bill Laswell, Philip Glass and the Kronos Quartet.

&quot;Mbalax&quot; (meaning &quot;rhythm&quot; in Wolof), derives its from accompanying rhythms used in &quot;sabar&quot;, a tradition that originated from the Serer of the Kingdom of Sine and spread to the Kingdom of Saloum whence Wolof migrants took it to the Wolof kingdoms. The &quot;Nder&quot; (lead drum), &quot;Sabar&quot; (rhythm drum), and &quot;Tama&quot; (talking drum) percussion section traces some of its technique to the ritual music of &quot;Njuup&quot;.

The &quot;Njuup&quot; was also progenitor of &quot;Tassu&quot;, used when chanting ancient religious verses. The griots of Senegambia still use it at marriages, naming ceremonies or when singing the praises of patrons. Most Senegalese and Gambian artists use it in their songs. The Serer people are known especially for vocal and rhythmic practices that infuse their everyday language with complex overlapping cadences and their ritual with intense collaborative layerings of voice and rhythm.&quot; Each motif has a purpose and is used for different occasions. Individual motifs represent the history and genealogy of a particular family and are used during weddings, naming ceremonies, funerals etc.

==Popular music==
Gambian popular music began in the 1960s. The Super Eagles and Guelewar formed under the influence of American, British and Cuban music. The Super Eagles played merengue and other pop genres with Wolof lyrics and minor African elements. They visited London in 1977, appearing on Mike Raven&#x27;s &quot;Band Call&quot;. After the programme, when the band began playing traditional tunes, an unknown listener is said to have inspired the group to return to the Gambia&#x27;s musical roots, and they spent two years travelling around studying traditional music. The reformed band was called Ifang Bondi, and their style was Afro-Manding blues.

Gambian Laba Sosseh, who relocated to Dakar, Senegal as a teenager, spent his entire career outside of the Gambia, becoming a significant presence in the African and New York salsa scene. Musa Ngum, former &quot;Guelewar&quot; and &quot;Super Diamono&quot; frontman relocated to Senegal in 1981. Civil unrest caused Ifang Bondi and other Gambian musicians to leave for Europe.

Former Ifang Bondi musician Juldeh Camara has been working with Justin Adams since 2007 and has been touring all over the world. Also from Ifang Bondi, Musa Mboob and Ousman Beyai have started a new group XamXam which started with a project in the Gambia to produce new music by taking six musicians based in the UK to the Gambia to work with top musicians from four different tribal backgrounds. Ousman Beyai moved to the UK where he worked with Musa Mboob to set up the live band XamXam.

Jaliba Kuyateh and his Kumareh band is currently the most popular exponent of Gambia&#x27;s Mandinka music. There is also a thriving Gambian hip hop scene.

The Hip-hop in Gambia started in the late 1990s. The first rap group of Gambia was black nature founded in 1995. Others crew are also in the hip-hop movement like Da fugitivz. They are mixing their music with their Traditional instruments like junjung, Balafon, Djembe etc... According to the development of the country some rapper are using the music for changes of the country.

It is impossible to overstate the importance of Alhaji Bai Konte as the first to introduce the kora and its musical culture to the live and mass media music audience. Every kora musician after his North American debut tour in 1973 owes him a unqualified debt of gratitude for his accomplishments. In 1973, Alhaji Bai Konte of Brikama, Gambia, introduced the kora to mass audiences in North America. He performed at some of the largest festivals in North America, appeared multiple times on National Public Radio and Television, was interviewed and reviewed by many newspapers. The tour would not have happened without the dedication and hard work of Marc and Susan Pevar, who organized, promoted and facilitated Alhaji Bai Konte&#x27;s tours in North American from 1973 through 1980. That story is told elsewhere, including: HOME

<text>Ian Matthias Bavitz (born June 5, 1976), better known by his stage name Aesop Rock, is an American rapper and producer from Long Island, New York. He was at the forefront of the new wave of underground and alternative hip hop acts that emerged during the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was signed to El-P&#x27;s Definitive Jux label until it went on hiatus in 2010. In a 2010 retrospective, betterPropaganda ranked him at number 19 at the &quot;Top 100 Artists of the Decade&quot;.

He released his first album, &quot;Music for Earthworms&quot;, in 1997, with &quot;Float&quot; following three years later. &quot;Labor Days&quot;, his third studio album, was released in September 2001. His next release, titled &quot;Bazooka Tooth&quot;, released 2 years later in September 2003. His fourth studio album, &quot;None Shall Pass&quot;, was released in August 2007. Its titular song became one of Ian&#x27;s most popular and well-known songs. His sixth record, &quot;Skelethon&quot;, was released in July 2012. His seventh release, &quot;The Impossible Kid&quot;, came out in April 2016. His eighth album, &quot;Spirit World Field Guide&quot;, came out in November 2020, with his ninth album, &quot;Garbology&quot;, released in November 2021. &quot;Integrated Tech Solutions&quot;, his tenth album, was released in November 2023.

He was a member of the groups The Weathermen, Hail Mary Mallon, and the Uncluded, and is currently the vocalist of duo Malibu Ken.

Regarding his name, he said: &quot;I acquired the name Aesop from a movie I had acted in with some friends. It was my character&#x27;s name and it sort of stuck. The rock part came later just from throwing it in rhymes.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Bavitz was born at Syosset Hospital in Syosset, New York, and raised in Northport, Long Island, New York to his father Paul and mother Jameija. Bavitz has two brothers: Christopher T. Bavitz (born 1973), a clinical professor at Harvard Law School and director of Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society, and Graham J. Bavitz (born 1978). Along with his siblings, Ian was raised Catholic, but he later became agnostic. Bavitz attended Northport High School in 1990 and graduated in 1994.

After graduating from high school, Bavitz attended Boston University in Massachusetts where he studied visual arts. He acquired his bachelor&#x27;s in 1998. He met his future collaborator, Blockhead, in 1994 during the latter&#x27;s only year at the school. After hearing Aesop Rock freestyle, Blockhead decided to forgo his own dreams of rapping in favor of focusing on production. Blockhead was involved with a crew in New York called The Overground that included Dub-L. During his early adulthood, Aesop Rock held various odd jobs including positions answering phones for clothing catalogs, packaging artwork in art gallery storerooms and working for one-hour photo developers.

== Career ==

=== 1985–2001: New York City underground music scene ===
As a youth, Bavitz and his family would usually commute to New York City. This had a great impact on him and the way he viewed the hip hop culture. Bavitz began rapping in the early 1990s. He cites Public Enemy, BDP, KMD, and Run DMC as early influences. Bavitz also listened to rock acts such as Dead Kennedys, Fugazi, and Ministry; he was introduced to these groups by his older brother Chris. Bavitz started to play the piano and bass at an early age and eventually acquired a sampler.

While attending college, Bavitz initially recorded and released two self-financed efforts, &quot;Music for Earthworms&quot; (1997), a full-length featuring underground artist Percee P on two tracks. Bavitz also released a music video for &quot;Abandon All Hope&quot;, which was one of the tracks on the CD. The album sold over 300 copies, largely from a grassroots internet-based promotion at his website AesopRock.com and then-popular web portal, MP3.com. His early records were mostly produced by his long-time friend Blockhead and underground producer Dub-L.

After his breakthrough success in the underground hip hop and indie rap community, he was eventually noticed by the Mush label and obtained his first record deal in 1999, just a year after he graduated from college. Aesop released his first major album, &quot;Float&quot; (2000), with guest appearances from Vast Aire, Slug, and Dose One. Production was split between Blockhead and Aesop himself, with one track by Omega One. During this time, Aesop worked at a photography gallery. In August 2001, Bavitz had a nervous breakdown. The song &quot;One of Four&quot; on his &quot;Daylight&quot; EP documents his struggles.

=== 2001–2004: &quot;Labor Days&quot;, &quot;Daylight&quot; EP, and &quot;Bazooka Tooth&quot; ===

Shortly after releasing &quot;Float&quot;, Aesop Rock signed to Manhattan-based label Definitive Jux (commonly shortened to Def Jux), where he released &quot;Labor Days&quot; (2001), an album dedicated to the discussion of labor in American society and the concept of &quot;wage slaves&quot;. Because of its popularity, &quot;Daylight&quot; was re-released in 2002 as a seven-track EP, including an &quot;alternative&quot; new version of the song &quot;Night Light&quot;, whose paraphrased lyrics simultaneously refer back to, and stand in stark opposition to, the original&#x27;s. The song &quot;Labor&quot; (from &quot;Labor Days&quot;) was featured in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;; it also was the first album in his catalog to break through the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, peaking at number 15 at the United States Independent Charts.
&quot;Labor Days&quot; was followed by &quot;Bazooka Tooth&quot; in 2003. For the first time, production was mostly handled by Bavitz himself, with three tracks from longtime collaborator Blockhead and one from close friend and Definitive Jux label CEO El-P. Guest appearances include Party Fun Action Committee, El-P, and Mr. Lif (all Definitive Jux labelmates) and Camp Lo. With this release Aesop hit a higher level of recognition, releasing &quot;No Jumper Cables&quot; as a single and music video, then another single, &quot;Freeze&quot;, shortly after. A remix of &quot;No Jumper Cables&quot; was featured on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;, furthering Aesop&#x27;s recognition. In 2004, he released &quot;Build Your Own Bazooka Tooth&quot; and created a contest in which contestants had to create a remix of an Aesop Rock song using the a cappellas and instrumentals.

=== 2005–2007: &quot;Fast Cars&quot; EP, &quot;None Shall Pass&quot; and Nike+iPod ===
In February 2005, Aesop Rock released a new EP, &quot;Fast Cars, Danger, Fire and Knives&quot;. The first pressing of the EP included an 88-page booklet with lyrics from every release from &quot;Float&quot; until this EP (the lyric booklet is titled &quot;The Living Human Curiosity Sideshow&quot;); later pressings of the album come without the booklet, but with an additional bonus track, &quot;Facemelter&quot;. In addition, a limited number of albums were available direct from Def Jux with Aesop Rock&#x27;s graffiti tag on them. In response to demands from his fans, Bavitz did less production on the EP; three songs are produced by Blockhead, three produced by Aesop, and one by Rob Sonic. During this time, he was asked to join The Weathermen to replace Vast Aire.

Aesop Rock was commissioned to create a 45-minute instrumental track for the Nike+iPod running system, entitled &quot;All Day&quot;. It was released in February 2007. Distributed via the iTunes Music Store and featuring Allyson Baker on guitar and with scratches from DJ Big Wiz, Aesop has described the release as &quot;something that evolved enough that the sound was constantly fresh and attractive, as though the runner were moving through a set of differing cities or landscapes.&quot;

&quot;All Day&quot; was followed in August of the same year by Bavitz&#x27;s fifth full-length album, &quot;None Shall Pass&quot;, released in 2007. The album contained original art by Jeremy Fish, whose work Rock set to a slideshow backed by a track titled &quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot;. It was exhibited in San Francisco and was available for download online. &quot;None Shall Pass&quot; had positive reviews from critics and fans, applauding Aesop for his change in sound.

=== 2008–2014: &quot;Skelethon&quot; and collaborations ===
After &quot;None Shall Pass&quot;, Aesop Rock did not release any solo projects for several years. During this period, Definitive Jux began its indefinite hiatus; thus, Aesop Rock&#x27;s next album, &quot;Skelethon&quot;, was instead released through Rhymesayers Entertainment. The album was released on July 10, 2012, and preceded by the single &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot;. After &quot;Skelethon&quot;″s release, Aesop Rock toured the United States to promote the album. He also performed on the first day of Coachella 2013.

During Bavitz&#x27;s hiatus from solo recording, he continued to collaborate with other musicians. In 2009, he produced Felt&#x27;s third album, &quot;Felt 3: A Tribute to Rosie Perez&quot;. He later joined frequent collaborators Rob Sonic and DJ Big Wiz to form the group Hail Mary Mallon, through which he released two albums: 2011&#x27;s &quot;Are You Gonna Eat That?&quot; and 2014&#x27;s &quot;Bestiary&quot;. Aesop Rock&#x27;s collaborations during this period also include the establishment of the Uncluded, a group he formed alongside anti-folk singer Kimya Dawson of the Moldy Peaches. The Uncluded released their debut album, &quot;Hokey Fright&quot;, on May 7, 2013, and subsequently supported it with a tour that included Rhymesayers&#x27; 2013 Summerfest.

=== 2016–present: &quot;The Impossible Kid&quot;, Malibu Ken, &quot;Spirit World Field Guide&quot;, and &quot;Integrated Tech Solutions&quot; ===
In February 2016, Aesop Rock released a music video for the song &quot;Rings&quot; and announced his seventh studio album &quot;The Impossible Kid&quot;, which was released on April 29, 2016. &quot;Rings&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Madden NFL 17&quot;.

In 2017, Aesop Rock scored his first film soundtrack for &quot;Bushwick&quot;. In January 2019, Aesop Rock collaborated with electronic musician Tobacco under the name Malibu Ken. The duo released a self-titled album in the same month. In late 2020, Aesop announced his eighth solo album, titled &quot;Spirit World Field Guide&quot;, along with the release of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Gates&quot;. In October 2021, Aesop announced a reunion with his former producer Blockhead with the album titled &quot;Garbology&quot;. The album was released on November 12 of the same year.

On December 9, 2022, Aesop Rock released the song &quot;Pumpkin Seeds&quot; featuring the Chicago rapper Lupe Fiasco and produced by Blockhead. The song is a fundraiser for the Collaboratory, an organization promoting two local DIY skateparks in Dayton, Ohio.

On September 14, 2023, Aesop Rock announced the release date of his ninth solo studio album &quot;Integrated Tech Solutions&quot;, which was released on November 10, 2023. That same day, he released the single &quot;Mindful Solutionism&quot; along with an accompanying music video. In October 2023, he released two singles that appear on &quot;Integrated Tech Solutions&quot;; &quot;By the River&quot; on October 5 and &quot;Infinity Fill Goose Down&quot; on October 26.

== Lyrics ==

Critics state that Bavitz&#x27;s use of words can be so detailed that it becomes difficult to determine any meaning. The lyrics are sometimes inspired by events which have occurred in Bavitz&#x27;s personal life and are thus naturally prone to subjective interpretation by outsiders.

Questioned about his lyrical style in an interview, Bavitz responded:

It&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s not the most accessible music in the world. It may pose a slight challenge to the listener beyond your average pop song. I&#x27;m no genius by a long shot, but these songs are not nonsensical, that&#x27;s pretty preposterous. I&#x27;d have to be a genius to pull this many nonsensical records over people&#x27;s eyes. It&#x27;s not exactly fast food but when people pretend I&#x27;m just spewing non-sequiturs and gibberish I can&#x27;t help but think they simply haven&#x27;t listened and are regurgitating some rumor they&#x27;ve heard about me. Even if it&#x27;s not laid out in perfect sentences—is any rap?—you&#x27;d have to be an idiot to not at least grasp a few things from these songs. Or have had no interest in pulling anything from them in the first place.

In 2002, on the song &quot;One of Four&quot; (a hidden track on the &quot;Daylight&quot; EP) Aesop Rock explains:

But I can tell you that I only write shit down when I believe it / so take this how you want but know I mean it.— &quot;One of Four&quot; &quot;Daylight&quot; EP (2002)
In May 2014, a study by Matt Daniels found that Aesop Rock&#x27;s vocabulary in his music surpassed 85 other major hip-hop and rap artists, as well as Shakespeare&#x27;s works and Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot;; he was cited as having the largest vocabulary in hip hop. To build up his vocabulary, he reads a lot of news and science articles and writes down all the words he finds interesting. Analysis of his lyrics identified him as the rapper with the most expansive vocabulary; using the most unique words in a rapper&#x27;s first 35,000 lyrics, he had 7,839 unique words.

==Personal life ==
In 2005, he married Allyson Baker, guitarist and vocalist of rock band Dirty Ghosts; they resided in San Francisco, but have since divorced.

<text>Power Girl, also known as Kara Zor-L, Karen Starr, and Paige Stetler, is a superheroine appearing in American comic books by DC Comics, making her first appearance in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #58 (January/February 1976). Power Girl is the cousin of the superhero Superman, but from an alternate universe in the fictional multiverse in which DC Comics stories are set. Originally hailing from the world of Earth-Two, first envisioned as the home of DC&#x27;s wartime heroes as published in 1940s comic books, Power Girl becomes stranded in the main universe where DC stories are set, and becomes acquainted with that world&#x27;s Superman and her own counterpart, Supergirl.

In common with Supergirl&#x27;s origin story, she is the daughter of Superman&#x27;s aunt and uncle and a native of the planet Krypton. The infant Power Girl&#x27;s parents enabled her to escape the destruction of her home planet by placing her in a rocket ship. Although she left the planet at the same time that Superman did, her ship took much longer to reach Earth-Two. On Earth, as with other Kryptonians, Power Girl discovered she possessed abilities like super strength, flight, and heat vision, using which she became a protector of innocents and a hero for humanity. Though the specifics of how vary over subsequent retellings, Power Girl is later stranded on another Earth when a cosmic crisis affects her home of Earth-Two, and later carves out a separate identity for herself from her dimensional counterpart Supergirl once they are forced to coexist.

Although she and Supergirl are biologically the same person, there are vast differences between the two. Power Girl is older and more level-headed due to her maturity, and her fighting style is more aggressive. She also adopts a different secret identity from her counterpart. These changes are reflected in their differing costumes and superhero names as well; Power Girl sports a bob of blond hair; wears a distinctive white, red, and blue costume with a cleavage-displaying cutout. The name Power Girl reflects that she chooses not to be seen as a derivative of Superman, but rather her own hero and this choice is reflected in the strong independent attitude of the character. Over various decades, Power Girl has been depicted as a member of superhero teams such as the Justice Society of America, Infinity, Inc., Justice League Europe, the Sovereign Seven, and the Birds of Prey.

Power Girl&#x27;s origin has gone through revisions, but over time has reverted to her original conception as the Supergirl of Earth-Two. The 1985 limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; eliminated Earth-Two from history, causing her to be retconned as the granddaughter of an Atlantean sorcerer known as Arion. This was an unpopular change and writers depicted the revised Power Girl inconsistently. The 2005–2006 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; limited series then restored her status as a refugee from the Krypton of the destroyed Pre-Crisis Earth-Two universe. This has been her consistent depiction ever since.

==Publication history==
Power Girl was introduced in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #58 in 1976, and was a member of the superhero team the Justice Society of America through the remainder of the 1970s and 1980s period known as the Bronze Age of Comics. Marvel Comics&#x27; then-publisher Stan Lee said in 1978 that when DC Comics created Power Girl after Marvel had introduced Power Man, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty annoyed about that. ...I&#x27;ve got to ask the Marvel lawyer – she&#x27;s supposed to be starting a lawsuit about that and I haven&#x27;t heard anything. I don&#x27;t like the idea. ... You know, years ago we brought out Wonder Man, and [DC Comics] sued us because they had Wonder Woman, and ... I said okay, I&#x27;ll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they&#x27;ve got Power Girl. Oh, boy. How unfair.&quot; Ironically, Marvel had previously published &quot;Thor&quot; #207, written by Power Girl co-creator Gerry Conway, in which Len Wein&#x27;s character says, &quot;Whoever heard of Powergirl, anyhow?&quot;

After &quot;All Star Comics&quot; was canceled as a part of the DC Implosion, the character would continue to appear along with the rest of the JSA in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; for a six-issue run. Due in part to her being one of the more popular characters in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; at the time, she was given a solo tryout in &quot;Showcase&quot; issues 97–99, which expanded on her pre-Crisis origin. During this time, she was a regularly featured character in the annual Justice Society crossovers in the original &quot;Justice League of America&quot; series. She was a founding member of &quot;Infinity Inc.&quot;, appearing in each of the first 12 issues and making later guest appearances.

After DC&#x27;s continuity-altering &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; storyline, her origin was retconned in &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #11 and she became a magic-based character with ties to ancient Atlantis, leading to appearances in &quot;The Warlord&quot;. The character did not receive her own self-titled series until the &quot;Power Girl&quot; miniseries of 1988. The character became a featured member of &quot;Justice League Europe&quot; (a spin off from &quot;Justice League International&quot;) for the run of the series. After the cancellation of JLI, the character joined Chris Claremont&#x27;s creator-owned series &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot; and appeared in several issues of &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;. She eventually rejoined the Justice Society in &quot;JSA&quot; #31 and became a regular part of that series and its follow-up, &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; vol. 3.

Power Girl played a significant role in the continuity-changing events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2005), which tied into her starring role in the first &quot;JSA Classified&quot; story arc &quot;Power Trip&quot; in 2005 (issues #1–4 of the series). These stories heavily featured the revelation that Power Girl was in fact the Earth-Two Power Girl and a Kryptonian, who survived &quot;Crisis&quot;, and that her Atlantean backstory had been a lie. Starting in July 2009, Power Girl received her first ongoing series, simply titled &quot;Power Girl&quot; (vol. 2), with the first twelve issues written by Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, drawn by Amanda Conner, and colored by Paul Mounts. According to Comic Book Resources, the series has been &quot;wildly praised for its fresh and fun approach.&quot;

When Palmiotti, Grey and Conner left the series after issue #12, Palmiotti said, &quot;Amanda always said she could just commit to the book for a year, and as we got into the series we realized that we just couldn&#x27;t do the same type of book with another artist at this point and decided it was a good idea to leave with her and give another team a shot.&quot; Judd Winick took over as writer with artist Sami Basri beginning with issue #13. Winick stated that the tone of the book will continue, and the premise of the character in New York.

The trade paperback &quot;Power Girl&quot; () collects &quot;Showcase&quot; issues #97–99, &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) issue #11, &quot;JSA&quot; issues 32 and 39, and &quot;JSA Classified&quot; issues #1–4. &quot;Power Girl: A New Beginning&quot; () collects the first six issues of the 2009 series. &quot;Power Girl: Aliens &amp; Apes&quot; () collects issues 7 through 12, and &quot;Power Girl: Bomb Squad&quot; () covers 13 to 18, and &quot;Power Girl: Old Friends&quot; collecting issues 19–27. The entirety of the Palmiotti/Grey/Conner run is contained in &quot;&quot;Power Girl: Power Trip&quot; ()&quot; which collects &quot;JSA Classified&quot; #1–4 and &quot;Power Girl&quot; #1–12.

==Fictional character biography==
===Journey from Krypton-Two===
Kara&#x27;s father discovers that Krypton is about to explode, and places her in a spacecraft directed towards the Earth. Although this occurs at the same time that Kal-L&#x27;s ship is launched, Kara&#x27;s ship travels more slowly, and she arrives on Earth decades after her cousin has landed. Kara&#x27;s Symbioship is designed to keep her in stasis during the journey and provide her with life experiences and education in the form of virtual reality. The Symbioship allows her to interact with virtual copies of her parents and fellow Kryptonians. Originally, by the time she arrives on Earth, Kara is shown to be in her early twenties. However, as mentioned in &quot;JSA Classified&quot; #1, her age at arrival has now been retconned to eighteen in post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity.

In &quot;Showcase&quot; #97, Kara is reclaimed by the sentient Symbioship and reimmersed into Kandorian society for a time. Several years of virtual time elapse, in which Kara is married and has a child. She is freed with the assistance of newspaper reporter Andrew Vinson, at which point she disables the ship.

===Debut===
Power Girl&#x27;s existence is not revealed to the general public until much later; her cousin Clark and his wife Lois Lane provide her a family environment to assist her transition towards real life relationships. In her first recorded adventure, Kara assists Justice Society members Flash and Wildcat with containing an artificially induced volcanic eruption in China. She then joins Robin and Star-Spangled Kid to form a Super Squad to assist the Justice Society in defeating Brainwave and Per Degaton, who were causing disasters around the world. She pushes their base towards the Sun, the heat causing the villains to fall unconscious. Later, she becomes a full member of the Society when Superman retires from active membership.

Having been raised by the Symbioship with artificial Kryptonian life experiences, Power Girl finds it difficult to adapt to life on Earth. However, with the help of reporter Andrew Vinson, she adopts the secret identity of computer programmer Karen Starr (she obtains her knowledge in this field from exposure to Wonder Woman&#x27;s Purple Ray on Paradise Island). On the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-Two, Power Girl&#x27;s closest friend is the Huntress, the daughter of the Earth-Two Batman and Catwoman.

The first contact between Power Girl and Earth-One&#x27;s universe was on the crossover &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #147, written by Paul Levitz &amp; Martin Pasko, where the character shows her attraction to that reality saying, &quot;It has a much nicer brand of Superman, y&#x27;know?&quot;.

===Atlantean===
The 1985 &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; limited series erased the existence of the Earth-Two Superman, and Power Girl&#x27;s continuity was thus substantially disrupted. Initially she believed herself to be Superman&#x27;s cousin, as she had been before the reboot. However, her background was retconned; she was told that she was the descendant of the Atlantean sorcerer Arion, and was frozen in suspended animation for millennia until the present day.

After the Justice Society disbands, Power Girl would join the Justice League. Later, while a member of Justice League Europe, she suffers a near fatal injury while battling a mystical being. Superman must assist in her medical treatment, using his heat-vision to perform surgery on her otherwise-invulnerable tissues. Although she recovers, Power Girl is significantly weaker, as she lost her vision powers and could not fly for a time. However, she regained them all as time went on. Power Girl adopts a one-eyed mangy cat, an animal which would affect much of the team. One aspect of this is her beloved cat is used to spy on the group by intelligence gathering criminals.

During the 1994 &quot;Zero Hour&quot; event, Power Girl experiences a mystical pregnancy and gives birth to a son (supposedly named Equinox), who ages rapidly. Finally he disappears, and has never been mentioned again in DCU.

Power Girl appeared in later issues of the &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot; series, Chris Claremont&#x27;s creator-owned comic book for DC. However, the final issue revealed that the entire series had been a story appearing in a comic book, and events in the book have had no bearing upon DC continuity.

Power Girl was one of Oracle&#x27;s first agents. Their short-lived partnership ended after a disastrous mission which resulted in a large loss of life. Power Girl believes that Oracle&#x27;s poor leadership was responsible for the tragedy, being disgusted that Oracle would sacrifice hundreds of lives &amp; herself following orders. Although she has worked with her again on a few occasions when needed, the relationship between the two is tense. In &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #35, Power Girl admitted that she is primarily to blame for the tension, but is unable to overcome the memories of the deaths.

Power Girl is a key member of the Justice Society, which she joined when it was reformed in the late 1990s. During an adventure with the JSA, she meets Arion, who reveals her Atlantean heritage to be a lie he concocted at the behest of Power Girl&#x27;s &quot;mother&quot;.

While attempting to save her teammate Ted Grant from the new female Crimson Avenger, Power Girl is severely wounded by supernatural bullets fired from the vigilante&#x27;s cursed handguns. Despite being saved by Doctor Mid-Nite, Power Girl comments that her near-death experience has shown her that she needs to make more personal connections outside of the superhero community.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===
====&quot;JSA Classified: Power Trip&quot;====
The Psycho-Pirate shows Kara multiple versions of her origin in an effort to drive her insane. Eventually, he reveals the truth: Power Girl is a survivor of Krypton from the dimension which contained the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-Two.

====The other survivors====
In the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, Kal-L himself returns to the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; DC Universe after breaking down the walls of the paradise dimension in which he, Lois Lane Kent (of Earth-Two), Alexander Luthor, Jr. (of Earth-Three), and Superboy-Prime (of Earth-Prime) had been living since the end of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. Appalled by the rapidly deteriorating state of affairs on the contemporary Earth, their goal is to replace the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth with a recreated Earth-Two. Kal-L&#x27;s first order of business is to track down Power Girl and explain the events of the original Crisis to her. Kal-L also reiterates her pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; history as his cousin. A touch from the ailing Lois of Earth-Two inexplicably restores Power Girl&#x27;s memories of pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-Two.

Soon after this revelation, Power Girl is confronted by Superboy-Prime, who renders her unconscious. She is attached to a &quot;tuning fork&quot;, a device controlled by Alex Luthor whose purpose is to bring back the multiple Earths. Alex Luthor and Psycho Pirate coerce Black Adam (who is also attached to the machine) into saying &quot;SHAZAM!&quot;, and use the now-raw magical energy to power the tower. After the reappearance of the created Earth-Two, everyone associated with that Earth is transported onto it (although Power Girl remains on New Earth because of her proximity to the tower).

After being brought to the barren created Earth-Two by Kal-L, Lois Lane Kent collapses and dies. A violent confrontation between the two Supermen ensues, at the end of which Kal-L comes to the realization that this created Earth-Two had not been a perfect world, since &quot;a perfect earth doesn&#x27;t need a Superman.&quot;

Power Girl is freed by Wonder Girl and Kon-El, and joins them in fighting Superboy-Prime and Alex Luthor. During a savage battle on Mogo, Superboy-Prime beats Kal-L to death and is later subdued by Kal-El. Power Girl is brought to Mogo by the Green Lantern Corps just in time to bid a tearful farewell to her dying cousin.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===
In the &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline in &quot;Supergirl&quot;, Kara takes up the mantle of Nightwing in an attempt to free the natives of Kandor. Ultraman, masquerading as Kal-El and working in concert with the Saturn Queen, has taken control of the bottle city. Kara Zor-El is the city&#x27;s Flamebird; she prevents Ultraman&#x27;s forces from executing the captured Power Girl. Power Girl is forced to leave Kandor with Kara (against her better judgment) after Saturn Queen reveals to Supergirl information about Supergirl&#x27;s past and purpose. This causes another rift to grow between the two women, as Power Girl feels Supergirl left an entire city of people to suffer, all because of her own selfish desires. This animosity is still on display when she next encounters Supergirl.

Power Girl remains a core member of the Justice Society. Power Girl is selected as the chairwoman of the team after Mr. Terrific steps down.

Power Girl is invited to rejoin Oracle&#x27;s Birds of Prey, but refuses, stating that she would do so only &quot;when Hell freezes over&quot;. Her ill will toward Oracle is the result of a single mission in which she served as one of Oracle&#x27;s agents, which ended badly. However, Power Girl does come to Oracle&#x27;s aid against the new female Spy Smasher&#x27;s attempt to take over the group in &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #108.

The appearance of the Earth-22 Superman (and his resemblance to Kal-L) upsets Kara greatly when he first arrives on New Earth. However, they adopt each other as family after a period of time.

Following the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, a new Multiverse is created. Among them is an Earth-2 from which its Power Girl and Superman are both missing. The Power Girl of this Earth returns to Earth-2 after failing to find her cousin. The Power Girl of New Earth is accidentally sent to the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Earth-2 by the &quot;Third World&quot; god Gog.

The Power Girl of New Earth faces off against the Power Girl and Justice Society Infinity of the new Earth-2, due to the Earth-2 Power Girl&#x27;s grief and rage over the loss of her cousin prompting her to believe that the &#x27;other&#x27; Power Girl is an impostor with some role in Superman&#x27;s absence. Power Girl returns to New Earth with the help of the Earth-2 Michael Holt, until the Justice Society Infinity follow her and take her back to Earth-2, where it is revealed that the recreation of the Multiverse created a new Earth-2 and duplicates of its heroes, including its own Power Girl. The Power Girl of New Earth then returns home with the JSA.

===Solo series and &quot;All-Stars&quot;===

Power Girl briefly appears in the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; crossover event, battling the forces of Darkseid after he conquers the Earth using the Anti-Life Equation.

After deciding to once again use the Karen Starr identity, she moves to New York City and begins rebuilding Starr Enterprises while continuing solo superheroics. She eventually takes teenaged hero-in-training Terra as her sidekick following the horrific events depicted in the &quot;Terror Titans&quot; mini-series. After the duo fight off a robot invasion of the city, Power Girl is kidnapped by the new Ultra-Humanite, who plans to transplant his brain into her body. Using her ice breath to destroy her gravity enhanced shackles and gag, Power Girl easily defeats the villain and saves New York. She also helps a trio of lost alien princesses and their bodyguard adjust to life on Earth, buying them a home in South America to stay until they can get back to their home planet.

Following a massive battle that ends in the destruction of the Justice Society&#x27;s HQ, the team decides to split up into two separate squads. Power Girl partners with Magog to start a more youth-oriented team dubbed the &quot;JSA All-Stars&quot;. Using Stargirl as leverage, the two are able to convince all of the teen JSA members except Jennifer Pierce to join the All-Stars. During the team&#x27;s inaugural press conference, they are attacked by a group of mercenaries led by the villainous nephew of Sylvester Pemberton. Karen and her team emerge victorious, only to discover that Pemberton has kidnapped Stargirl during the confusion of the battle. The team eventually rescues Stargirl.

During the 2009–2010 &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, both JSA teams gather in Manhattan to stave off the invading Black Lantern Corps. Several of the team members examine the corpses of Kal-L and Psycho Pirate, both of whom had been reanimated as Black Lanterns only to be killed again during a battle with Superboy and Superman. Karen breaks down in tears upon seeing the twisted corpse of Kal-L, and swears vengeance upon whoever is behind the creation of the Black Lanterns. While on her way to the streets of Manhattan to assist her teammates, Karen hears Ma Hunkel screaming. She rushes to her side, only to see Ma being attacked by the Black Lantern Lois Lane-Kent of pre-Crisis Earth-Two. Black Lantern Lois sacrifices herself by removing her ring and giving it to Kal-L to reanimate him. During the battle between Kal-L and Power Girl, Mr. Terrific invents a machine to destroy the Black Lanterns. He activates the machine and it wipes out the Black Lantern ring connection and Kal-L and completely dissolves Kal-L&#x27;s corpse.

===&quot;Brightest Day&quot;===
In the 2010–2011 storyline &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Power Girl attacks her comrades, and after being subdued, is discovered to have been possessed by the Starheart (the cosmic entity that gave Alan Scott and Jade their powers) to which she was vulnerable because of her Kryptonian heritage, as Kryptonians draw their abilities from the sun. Staying out of action in order avoid another possession, she helps Mr. Terrific work on a machine that may be able to dampen the Starheart&#x27;s power. Nonetheless, the Starheart takes control of Miss Martian&#x27;s body and transforms into her White Martian form, causing her to attack her comrades again. Batman ultimately tells her to stay on Earth and try to fight the other metahumans being controlled by the Starheart, explaining that bringing her along would jeopardize the mission.

During the events of &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;, Power Girl assists her fellow heroes in a global manhunt to track down Maxwell Lord, the former head of Justice League International and the murderer of Ted Kord, who had been restored to life at the end of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;. Lord uses his powers to erase his existence from the minds of everyone on the planet, including Power Girl. She subsequently helps Booster Gold find proof of Lord&#x27;s existence. Through the course of their search, during which Power Girl encounters Divine, a raven-haired clone of herself, she manages to regain her memory of Lord. As she attempts to inform the Justice Society of this, Lord uses his powers to take control of her and attack the Justice League International, but manages to convince the others of his existence through the exhumation of Ted Kord&#x27;s corpse.

===&quot;DC Universe&quot;===
In the post-&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; DC Universe, Power Girl is trapped in an interdimensional void. Tanya Spears tries to free her using an etheric transponder that allows her to travel there in an incorporeal state, but her physical body was disconnected from the machine by an unaware Kid Flash (Wallace West), so both women remain trapped as a result.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, the &quot;original&quot; Power Girl returns to the DC Universe when Doctor Manhattan, inspired by Superman, undoes the changes that he made to the New 52 timeline that erased the Justice Society and the Legion of Super-Heroes.

Following the &quot;Lazarus Planet&quot; storyline, Power Girl is given new psychic abilities by the Lazarus rains, and forges a bond with fellow psychic Omen, who becomes her &quot;best friend&quot;, with whom she opens a superhero counselling service. Exploring her identity, Power Girl also changes her human alias from &quot;Karen Starr&quot; to &quot;Paige Stetler&quot;. In &quot;Power Girl Special&quot; (2023), Power Girl and is urged by Jon and Kara to get over her imposter syndrome and &quot;accept&quot; the love and family that the Superman Family so readily want to give her. Kara&#x27;s diary reveals she feels the most profound personal connection with Karen and longs for them to be closer friends. Karen adopts Streaky the Supercat at Kara&#x27;s behest. Though she loses her psychic abilities in a confrontation with Johnny Sorrow, she is left with a new &quot;astral punch&quot; ability that creates doorways to the astral realm. In the ongoing series, she establishes her new civilian persona as Dr. Paige Stetler, technology specialist and columnist for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. In issue #12, the newspaper&#x27;s editor-in-chief, Lois Lane, who is privy to Paige&#x27;s dual identity, offers her a field-reporter position to enable her to both write longer-form stories from the scene of crises and act as Power Girl to resolve them.

In the pages of &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Power Girl was with the Justice Society when they fought Angle Man and an army of Bizarros when a Huntress from a possible future arrived. Per Degaton tried to use a Kryptonite ring on Power Girl only for Huntress to shoot off his finger causing him to retreat. Power Girl tells Deadman, Detective Chimp, Madame Xanadu, and the rest of the Justice Society that Huntress is heading to Gotham City. Power Girl is among those that catch up to Huntress and Batman as Per Degaton attacks with his time clones. It took the different Doctor Fates from across time to trap Per Degaton in Huntress&#x27; snow globe which erases Huntress&#x27; possible future. Huntress later spoke to Power Girl about how the ranks of the Justice Society of America are filling up and how her erased future had redeemed villains. Power Girl is told by Huntress that if the JSA goes down that path, they should start by recruiting Solomon Grundy. Power Girl accompanied Mister Terrific and Jakeem Thunder in visiting Icicle II in Belle Reve Penitentiary to offer him a second chance by joining the JSA. When Icicle II states that he will take the offer if they can get him away from the heat lamps, Power Girl warns him that she will use her own &quot;built-in heat lamps&quot; if he crosses the line.

==Powers and abilities==
As the biological cousin of Superman, Power Girl exhibits all of the classic Kryptonian powers: super strength; flight; super speed; invulnerability; x-ray, telescopic, microscopic and heat vision; freeze breath; and super-hearing. Over the years various writers have given Power Girl&#x27;s Kryptonian power differing levels, reflecting the lower powers of the Earth-Two Superman Kal-L. For example, Power Girl can fly through space, but has to breathe, so before she leaves a planet, she must take a deep breath and hold it for several hours until she needs a new oxygen source. Power Girl needs to sleep or she will experience disorientation due to fatigue. However, as recently shown in &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, she now draws her superpowers from yellow sunlight, just like Superman. The reason for this change has not yet been explained.

Since she is from an alternative universe (pre-Crisis Earth-Two), Power Girl is immune to Kryptonite from other universes. As Karen Starr, she is an accomplished businesswoman and is regarded by Mr. Terrific as a first rate scientist. Even though Power Girl is from an alternative universe, her biology is still similar to Superman&#x27;s. As one of a handful of characters who survived the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, DC editorial was initially uncertain how to portray the character and attempted to portray Power Girl with a non-Kryptonian origin for a number of years. Power Girl&#x27;s abilities have fluctuated since 1986. For some time, Power Girl believed she was an Atlantean. At one point, Power Girl possessed telekinesis; at another she was vulnerable to attacks by certain natural elements (for example, wooden weapons). After sustaining severe injuries from a magic attack Power Girl retained only a degree of super strength, speed and durability. However, she later recovered her ability to fly, and writers have gradually restored her superpowers.

==Physical appearance and costumes==

Power Girl&#x27;s original Wally Wood artwork (1976) showed her as relatively busty but otherwise her figure and build conformed in appearance to other contemporary comic book women. However, in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (vol. 3) #34 (2009), written by Gail Simone, Dinah Lance, the Black Canary, mentions Power Girl as having the top bosom of DCU, describing her assets as a &quot;national treasure&quot;. Her most common outfit is a leg-baring, figure-hugging, long-sleeved white leotard with a keyhole cut-out opening in the chest.

According to character writer Jimmy Palmiotti, &quot;Okay. When the character was created, Wally Wood was the artist that drew Power Girl, and he was convinced that the editors were not paying attention to anything he did. So, his inker said &quot;Every issue, I&#x27;m going to draw the tits bigger until they notice it. It took about seven or eight issues before anyone was like, &quot;Hey, what&#x27;s with the tits?&quot; And that&#x27;s where they stopped. True story.&quot;

Power Girl was at one time portrayed as having a highly athletic but slender physique. Artists Bart Sears (in the &quot;Justice League Europe&quot; series), and later Alex Ross (in the limited series &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;) restored Power Girl&#x27;s well-endowed shape. Ross rendered her as a heavily muscled &quot;Power Woman&quot; (as if she was an ardent bodybuilder).

The character is consistently depicted as a large-breasted young woman, and her physique is one of her most recognizable attributes – to the extent that various writers have acknowledged it in both serious and humorous ways.

For example, &quot;Justice League Europe&quot; #37 (1992) attempts to explain Power Girl&#x27;s revealing costume by having Crimson Fox question her about it; she receives the reply that the costume &quot;shows what I am: female, healthy. If men want to degrade themselves by staring, that&#x27;s their problem, I&#x27;m not going to apologize for it.&quot;

Conversely, in &quot;JSA: Classified&quot; #2 (2005), writer Geoff Johns has Power Girl explain her cleavage-window to Superman, revealing that &quot;the first time I made this costume, I wanted to have a symbol, like you. I just…I couldn&#x27;t think of anything. I thought eventually, I&#x27;d figure it out. And close the hole. But I haven&#x27;t.&quot; A similar treatment of the character can be seen in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #4 (written by Jeph Loeb), in which the heroes need to distract the Toyman while Batman and Superman battle Captain Marvel and Hawkman. Batman suggests that Power Girl&#x27;s endowments would be likely to distract Toyman, a 13-year-old boy. Toyman later attempts to make a reference to the size of her chest before being cut off by Superman. A variant of this joke is included in the &quot;Superman/Batman: Public Enemies&quot; animated film.

Power Girl&#x27;s costume design has varied greatly over the years. Her classic costume design from &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #58 is that which is in use today: a red cape and belt, blue gloves and boots, and a white bodysuit sporting a circular cleavage-exposing cut-out on her chest (its variable size and shape determined by the artist depicting her). According to Gerry Conway, &quot;The true, dumb reason for the circle? At the time, it was a convention for hero costumes to have a chest symbol. I thought a giant &#x27;P&#x27; looked silly. The circle was intended as a nod to convention without being conventional. Not a sexy thing at all, until Wally Wood&#x27;s inks.&quot; This window was closed for the first time in &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; #64, pencilled by Wood. According to Conway, it was dictated by publisher Jenette Kahn, because &quot;she felt it was sexist&quot;. During her time with Justice League Europe/America, she wears a capeless yellow and white spandex unitard, and later a blue and white spandex unitard with a short mini-cape, headband, and a diamond shaped opening on her chest, once again exposing her cleavage. She has also worn a headband, as had Supergirl prior to her death in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. In a guest appearance in &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, Kara is seen in her large wardrobe closet with every costume design she has ever worn in DC continuity, deciding which costume to wear for that mission. Her original costume returned when Johns and David Goyer had her rejoin the JSA.

In &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot; #16, she sports a variation of her traditional costume that includes pants.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1939:

==Events==
* Kawasaki Heavy Industries transfers its aircraft engine production business to its subsidiary, the Kawasaki Aircraft Engineering Company.
* The Showa Aeroplane Company Ltd. begins to produce aircraft for the Imperial Japanese Navy at Showa, Japan.

===January===
* President Franklin D. Roosevelt asks the United States Congress to strengthen the air power of the United States, which he describes as &quot;utterly inadequate.&quot;
* During flight testing, the prototype of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force′s (IJAAF) Nakajima Ki-43 (Allied reporting name &quot;Oscar&quot;) fighter displays poor takeoff and landing characteristics and proves to be far less maneuverable and only slightly faster than the fighter it is intended to replace, the Nakajima Ki-27 (Allied reporting name &quot;Nate&quot;). The IJAAF considers ending further development of the Ki-43, but its co-designer, Hideo Itokawa, convinces the IJAAF to allow him to redesign the aircraft.
* January 5 – Pioneering U.S. aviator Amelia Earhart is officially declared dead, eighteen months after her disappearance over the Pacific.
* January 7 – A Swissair Douglas DC-2-115B (registration HB-ITA) with 17 people on board strikes a hill near Senlis, France, while on approach to Paris-Le Bourget Airport and crashes, killing five of its occupants and seriously injuring four others.
* January 12 – The Royal Air Force″s Auxiliary Air Force is formed.
* January 13
**Northwest Airlines Flight 1, a Lockheed 14H Super Electra, crashes into a ravine shortly after takeoff from Miles City Municipal Airport in Miles City, Montana, killing all four people on board.
**The Syndicato Condor Junkers Ju 52/3mge &quot;Marimba&quot; (registration PP-CAY) crashes into a mountain in the Serra do Sambé northeast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and catches fire, killing all 10 people on board. 
* January 21 – The Imperial Airways Short Empire flying boat &quot;Cavalier&quot;, tail number G-ADUU, flying from Port Washington, New York, to Bermuda with 13 people on board, ditches and sinks in the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City after icing causes its engines to fail. Three people on board die, but the commercial tanker &quot;Esso Baytown&quot; rescues the 10 survivors after they spend 10 hours in the water.
* January 26 – In the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona surrenders to Nationalist forces. In the days leading up to the surrender, Nationalist aircraft have raided the city continually, especially targeting ships in port to prevent them from saving Republican refugees from capture.
* January 29 – Karl Bode breaks the world altitude record for helicopters, flying a Focke-Wulf Fw 61 helicopter to an altitude of . It is the last official record set by a German helicopter produced prior to 1945.

===February===
* February 4 – The Boeing XB-15 prototype, assigned to the United States Army Air Corps 2nd Bombardment Group at Langley Field, Virginia, takes off under the command of Major Caleb V. Haynes to carry of American Red Cross emergency supplies to Santiago, Chile, in the wake of the 1939 Chillán earthquake. It arrives at Santiago only 30 hours later, making only two stops along the way, at France Field in the Panama Canal Zone, and at Lima, Peru.

* February 9 – Alex Henshaw sets a new speed record of 4 days 10 minutes for the round trip between England and Cape Town in a Percival Mew Gull.
* February 11 – The Lockheed XP-38 falls 17 minutes short of the record for a flight across the United States, flying from March Field, California, to Mitchel Field, New York, in 7 hours 43 minutes. It loses power and crashes during its final approach at Mitchell Field, but its pilot is unhurt and the flight is considered an impressive demonstration of range and speed for a fighter.
* February 12 – Spanish Nationalist forces have 600 aircraft, compared to only 40 available on the Republican side.
* February 16 – The Spanish Republican Air Force reports that it has only 25 Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters, two squadrons of Tupolev SB-2 bombers, and three squadrons of Polikarpov R-5 bombers.
* February 24 – A German Ministry of Aviation Junkers Ju 52/3mge (registration D-ALUS) taking German Condor Legion pilots who had fought in the Spanish Civil War home to Germany crashes into a mountain in Roubion, France, during a snowstorm, killing all 10 people on board. Its wreckage is not found until March 4.

===March===
* To improve coordination of aviation affairs within the United States Army, the United States Department of War places both General Headquarters Air Force (responsible for U.S. Army air combat operations) and the United States Army Air Corps (responsible for aviation logistics and training) under the command of the Chief of the Air Corps, Major General Henry H. Arnold.
* &quot;General der Flieger&quot; Albert Kesselring, commander of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 1, states that he doubts that even highly technically competent bomber crews can hit targets with any accuracy at night or in bad weather.
* March 7 – All American Aviation (the future All American Airways, Allegheny Airlines, USAir, and US Airways) begins operations, providing passenger and mail service.
* March 18 – During a test flight of a Boeing 307 Stratoliner (registration NX19901) at an altitude of , a KLM test pilot attempts a pre-approved test of the aircraft&#x27;s flying characteristics at low speed with both engines on one side shut down. The Stratoliner stalls, goes into a spin, loses its wings and tail section, and crashes near Alder, Washington, killing all 10 people on board.
* March 25 – Ongoing ceasefire negotiations between Nationalist and Republican officials which include a Nationalist demand that all Spanish Republican Air Force aircraft fly to Nationalist airfields to surrender on this day are broken off when Republican aircraft do not surrender. A major motivation for the Nationalist demand is to prevent Republican leaders from fleeing Spain by air; six Republican aircraft carry officials and refugees from central Spain to France on this day.
* March 26 – Republican leader Segismundo Casado López telegraphs Nationalist leader Francisco Franco, announcing that the Spanish Republican Air Force will surrender to Nationalist forces the following day. Franco replies that Nationalist armies would advance on Republican territory anyway.

During the 32½-month war, the Nationalists have used about 1,300 aircraft and the Republicans about 1,500; about 10,000 people have died in air attacks. Early Republican numerical air superiority had been challenged almost immediately by the technical superiority of Italian Fiat CR.32 fighters and Savoia-Marchetti SM.81, and German Junkers Ju 52 bomber-transports; Soviet Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters had given the Republicans air superiority in the winter of 1936–1937, but the Nationalists had achieved lasting air superiority after German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and Heinkel He 111 bombers and Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers had arrived in 1937. Germany has sent about 600 aircraft to Spain, Italy about 660, the Soviet Union 1,000, and other countries (principally France) about 350. The German, Italian, and Soviet air forces have learned a great deal about the employment of modern aircraft in warfare through their involvement, and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s Condor Legion in particular has used the conflict to test new aircraft and revolutionary new air warfare concepts.
**The Spanish Republican government airline LAPE ceases operations. The Franco government expropriates LAPE&#x27;s aircraft and transfers them to the airline Iberia.
**On the ninth anniversary of its founding, the Fieseler aircraft manufacturing company changes its name from Fieseler Flugzeugbau Kassel to the Gerhard Fieseler Werke GmbH.
* April 3 – The leading ace of the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalist pilot Joaquín García Morato y Castaño, dies when his Fiat CR.32 fighter crashes while he is performing low-level aerobatics for newsreel cameras. He had scored 40 victories during the war.
* April 26 – German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; &quot;Flugkapitän&quot; Fritz Wendel sets a new world air speed record, reaching in the Messerschmitt Me 209 V1 racing aircraft. The German government will report that the record was set by an &quot;Me 109R,&quot; a false designation used as part of a 1939 propaganda campaign to confuse other countries into thinking that the Me 209 is an advanced variant of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter.
* April 28 – Vladimir Kokkinaki and Mikhail Godienko attempt a non-stop flight from the Soviet Union to New York but are forced down on Miscou Island in bad weather the next day.

<text>Jennie George (born Eugenie Sinicky; 28 August 1947) is an Australian politician, and former Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from November 2001 to July 2010, representing the Division of Throsby, New South Wales.

==Early life==
George was born in Trani, Italy, where her parents Oleg and Natasha were displaced persons from the Soviet Union. Oleg and Natasha separated in 1955 and divorced in 1958. Oleg died in 1960, aged 39, after years of heavy drinking and smoking, during which he was frequently violent towards his wife and sometimes his daughter. She was educated at the Burwood Girls High School (where she was first called Jennie, as Eugenie was deemed too hard to pronounce), Sydney University and the Sydney Teachers College.

In February 1968 she married Paddy George, a full-time activist for the Communist Party and NSW State Secretary of the Eureka Youth League, of which she was also a member. Jennie George was a secondary school teacher and an active member of the teachers&#x27; union.

George was elected General Secretary of the New South Wales Teachers Federation 1980–82.

==Career==
George was Vice President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in 1987, Assistant Secretary of the ACTU 1991-96 and President of the ACTU 1996- March 2000. She was the first woman to hold this position. She was Assistant National Director, Trade Union Training Authority 1989-91 and a board member of Delta Electricity from 2000 to 2001.

In November 1994 she was endorsed as the Left faction&#x27;s candidate for a Victorian Senate seat. When Victorian Senator Olive Zakharov, also a member of the Left, was killed in a road accident in March 1995, it was assumed that George would be nominated to fill the casual vacancy. However, factional negotiations resulted in the seat going to a member of the Right faction, Jacinta Collins. George then withdrew her candidacy and did not reconsider a political career until returning to Sydney after leaving the ACTU. She sought support for a seat in either of the houses of the NSW Parliament, but this came to nothing. She was then offered a chance to stand for the federal seat of Throsby in New South Wales in 2001.

George served on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage from 20 March 2002, on the Standing Committee on Family and Community Services from 20 March 2002 to 31 August 2004 and on the Standing Committee on Family and Human Services from 2 December 2004. She was Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Environment and Heritage from 2004 to 2007.

She retired from Parliament at the 2010 federal election.

Unlike other ACTU Presidents (including most notably former Prime Minister Bob Hawke) who went on to be elected to Federal Parliament, George did not hold a ministerial position during her federal parliamentary career.

She was made an Officer (AO) in the General Division of the Order of Australia on 10 June 2013.

<doc id="566014" wikidata="Q7808480" url="?curid=566014" title="Tint control">
<text>Because the NTSC color television standard relies on the absolute phase of the color information, color errors occur when the phase of the video signal is altered between source and receiver, or due to non linearities in electronics. To correct for phase errors, a tint control is provided on NTSC television sets, which allows the user to manually adjust the phase relationship between the color information in the video and the reference for decoding the color information, known as the &quot;color burst&quot;, so that correct colors may be displayed.

The tint control is normally set by sight to create satisfactory skin tones in a picture. The range of adjustment typically allows these colors to be adjusted from a green to a magenta tint. Television sets produced in recent decades typically include a (sometimes non-defeatable) distortion of the color decoding spectrum, to minimize the visual effects of phase error and lessen the need to adjust the tint control.

On broadcast equipment, such as timebase correctors and studio monitors, this control is typically marked &quot;phase,&quot; as it adjusts the phase of the color signal with respect to the color burst signal.

Since the problem of phase errors in the real world became well known after the introduction of NTSC, the later PAL and SECAM color television standards attempted to correct for them. PAL uses the same color modulation scheme as NTSC but averages the received color information over adjacent scan lines, resulting in reduced color detail but canceling out small to moderate phase errors. (Severe phase errors result in picture grain and loss of color saturation in the PAL scheme.) SECAM uses a different modulation scheme that does not rely on the phase of the color signal. Because of this the amplitude of the color signal (color saturation) is unaffected as well. Because SECAM only broadcasts half the color information on each line, the color resolution is halved just like in the PAL system. Most TV sets designed for these later standards lack tint controls, as PAL and SECAM are not supposed to experience the problems a tint control would correct. (This leaves the viewer unable to correct for color errors originating at the transmission site, however.) Multistandard sets have tint controls for NTSC viewing, but the controls are inoperative when watching PAL or SECAM signals.

<text>A letterer is a member of a team of comic book creators responsible for drawing the comic book&#x27;s text. The letterer&#x27;s use of typefaces, calligraphy, letter size, and layout all contribute to the impact of the comic. The letterer crafts the comic&#x27;s &quot;display lettering&quot;: the story title lettering and other special captions and credits that usually appear on a story&#x27;s first page. The letterer also writes the letters in the word balloons and draws in sound effects. Many letterers also design logos for the comic book company&#x27;s various titles.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

By the time comic books came of age in the 1940s, the huge volume of work demanded by publishers had encouraged an assembly-line process, dividing the creative process into distinct tasks: writer, penciller, letterer, inker, and colorist. By the late 1940s, it became possible to make a living just lettering comic strips and comic books for artists, studios, and companies that did not have the time or desire to do it in-house. The career of freelance letterer was born, and by the 1950s, letterers such as Gaspar Saladino, Sam Rosen, and Ben Oda were crafting full-time careers as letterers for DC Comics, Marvel Comics, and King Features.

Letterer and logo designer Ira Schnapp defined the DC Comics look for nearly thirty years. Starting in 1940, he designed or refined such iconic logos as &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, and &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, while also creating the distinctive appearance of DC&#x27;s house ads and promotions. (Schnapp also designed the Comics Code Authority seal, which was a fixture on comic book covers from all major companies for over forty years.)

DC Comics used a stable of more than 20 letterers in the comics they published in the 1950s and 1960s (some of the letterers — like Jerry Robinson and Dick Sprang — were more well known as artists): 

* John Costanza
* Jon D&#x27;Agostino
* Ben Oda
* Jerry Robinson
* Joe Rosen
* George Roussos
* Gaspar Saladino
* Ira Schnapp
* Dick Sprang
Starting in around 1966, Ira Schnapp&#x27;s classic, art deco-inspired look was replaced by the pulsing, organic style of Gaspar Saladino, who redesigned DC&#x27;s house style for the counterculture era. Gaspar became the cover letterer for all of DC&#x27;s books throughout the 1970s, and even &quot;ghosted&quot; as Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;page-one&quot; letterer for much of the same period. Gaspar&#x27;s work became so iconic that various independent comics publishers which sprang up in the 1970s and 1980s – such as Atlas/Seaboard, Continuity Comics, and Eclipse Comics – hired him to design logos for their entire line of titles.

From the 1930 through the 1990s (with a few exceptions), the letterer plied his craft on the same page drawn by the penciler. (The penciled art was then inked after the letterer has completed his work on the page.) At DC Comics during the &quot;Silver Age&quot; of the 1960s, pencilers were required to &quot;rough in balloons and sound effects&quot; for the letterers to later go over. An accomplished letterer was able to adapt his or her style to the style of the art for that particular book.

=== Computer lettering ===
The evolution of desktop publishing powered by computers, especially those made by Apple, began in the 1980s, and started having a gradual impact on comics lettering soon after. One of the first users of computer-generated lettering was writer/artist John Byrne, who made fonts from existing lettering. (Incidentally, Byrne made use of existing lettering by other artists, such as Dave Gibbons, without their permission. Now Byrne uses a computer font based on the handwriting of letterer Jack Morelli – with Morelli&#x27;s permission.) Other early users of computer lettering were David Cody Weiss and Roxanne Starr, who experimented in computer lettering with Bob Burden&#x27;s &quot;Flaming Carrot Comics&quot;.

Computer lettering really started making an impact with the availability of the first commercial comic book font, &quot;Whizbang&quot; (created by Studio Daedalus) around 1990.

In the early 1990s letterer Richard Starkings and his partner John Roshell (formerly Gaushell) began creating comic book fonts and started Comicraft, which has since become the major source of comics fonts (though they have competition from others, such as Blambot).

In deference to tradition, at first computer lettering was printed out and pasted onto the original artwork, but after a few years, as comics coloring also moved to desktop publishing, digital lettering files began to be used in a more effective way by combining them directly with digital art files, eliminating the physical paste-up stage altogether. Wildstorm Comics was ahead of the curve, Marvel came around a few years later, and DC held to traditional production methods the longest, but now nearly all lettering is digitally applied.

In the early years of the 21st Century, the mainstream American comics companies moved almost exclusively to in-house computer lettering, effectively ending the era of the freelance letterer. Chris Eliopoulos designed the fonts for Marvel&#x27;s in-house lettering unit, and Ken Lopez did the same at DC. Since then the trend has swung the other way, with most comics publishers once again using freelance letterers rather than in-house staff. Nearly all use computer and digital comic book fonts.

== Tools and methods ==

=== On-the-board ===
The traditional comic book letterer needs little more than a lettering guide, a pen or brush, India ink, and white paint for corrections. Some situations required the letterer to use vellum overlays on top of the original art.

=== EC Comics ===
The lettering in the comics of the sensationalist horror comics publisher EC Comics (c. 1945 – c. 1955) was different from other publishers – its mechanical appearance gave it a sterile aspect, and helped define the particular style of comics EC was known for. EC&#x27;s letterers achieved their particular look by using a Leroy lettering set, a device popular amongst draftsmen and architects. The Leroy lettering set consisted of a stylus and a pantographic lettering form.

=== Computer lettering ===
Most Marvel and DC books are now lettered using a graphics program such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop or Adobe InDesign, and a font that resembles hand lettering. Computer lettering provides a lot of technical shortcuts, especially by combining the lettering work directly with digital art files, eliminating the tedious physical paste-up stage altogether. Some letterers handwrite part of the script. Hand-lettering is often used for sound effects and onomatopoeia in comics.

There are also still comics artists and inkers who prefer to have the lettering directly on their pages. First, it saves drawing time (not having to put art where a big caption will be); and second, comics tell a story, and a page of comics art without the lettering is only half the story.

Long-time letterer John Workman toes a middle ground between traditional and digital lettering. In addition to his &quot;on-the-art boards work&quot;, Workman has been electronically hand-lettering by way of a Wacom tablet.

== Awards and recognition ==
The Shazam Awards, given from 1970 to 1975, had a &quot;best letterer&quot; category. Both the Harvey Awards (given starting in 1992) and the Eisner Awards (given starting in 1993) have a &quot;best letterer&quot; category. Todd Klein has won the Eisner award for lettering fifteen times and has won the Harvey Award for lettering eight times. Ken Bruzenak, Chris Ware, John Workman, and Dan Clowes have all won the Harvey Award for lettering multiple times.

<doc id="566021" wikidata="Q461441" url="?curid=566021" title="A Show of Hands">
<text>A Show of Hands is a live album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1989. The band released a video of the same name, originally on VHS and LaserDisc, the same year. A DVD version was released as part of a box set in 2006, and as an individual DVD in 2007. In 2015 it was reissued after being remastered by Sean Magee at Abbey Road Studios following a direct approach by Rush to remaster their entire back catalogue.

==Recording==
The majority of the performances on this album were from the 1988 &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; tour, recorded in the American cities of New Orleans, Phoenix, and San Diego, and the British city of Birmingham. &quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot; and &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; were recorded in East Rutherford, New Jersey, during the 1986 &quot;Power Windows&quot; tour. The opening track &quot;Intro&quot; features The Three Stooges theme playing in the background; the band used this music to open many of their concerts during the 1980s.

With the exception of &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, the tracklist focuses almost entirely on the band&#x27;s material from the 1980s, and is Rush&#x27;s only live record to feature no performances of songs released before 1977. Unlike &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot; and &quot;Exit...Stage Left&quot;, this album does not have any songs that had to be omitted for single CD release. The first two were released prior to the introduction of compact discs and were double album sets, whilst this album was initially released on CD so time restrictions were already taken into account.

==Video release==
The video was filmed at the first of two Birmingham (UK) shows which took place on April 23–24, 1988 at the city&#x27;s NEC Arena - one of the sources of the live album. The song order and selection of the video are different from the live album. The laserdisc release also includes the song &quot;Lock and Key&quot;.

==Singles==
*&quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; / &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; (7&quot;)
*&quot;Mission&quot; (12&quot; promo)
*&quot;Marathon&quot; (12&quot;/CD promo)

==Track listing==
All songs written by Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart, except where noted.

*Track 4 features a drum solo.
==Personnel==
*Geddy Lee – bass guitar, synthesizers, vocals
*Alex Lifeson – electric and acoustic guitars, synthesizers, backing vocals 
*Neil Peart – drums, percussion

==Remaster details==
&quot;A Show of Hands&quot; was remastered in 2011 by Andy VanDette for the &quot;Sector&quot; box sets, which re-released all of Rush&#x27;s Mercury-era albums. &quot;A Show Of Hands&quot; is included in the &quot;Sector 3&quot; set.

<text>Red Sky at Morning: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment by James Gustave Speth, is a 2004 Yale University Press book whose central premise is that environmentalism, so far, has been unsuccessful in protecting the natural environment on Earth. Deprecating the past efficacy of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and the United Nations Development Programme — as well as the actions of the former George W. Bush administration – Speth writes (as cited in the &quot;TIME&quot; article listed in the &quot;References&quot; section): &quot;The climate convention is not protecting climate, the biodiversity convention is not protecting biodiversity, [and] the desertification convention is not preventing desertification.&quot;

Potential for effective environmentalism, he says (as cited in the &quot;TIME&quot; article) now rests upon actions analogous to &quot;jazz&quot;: volunteerism, and improvisation. He also notes, &quot;Since the Montreal Protocol, [the United States] has not accorded global-scale environmental challenges the priority needed.&quot; (&quot;p.116&quot;)

<text>The Northrop YB-35/XB-35, Northrop designation N-9 or NS-9, were experimental heavy bomber aircraft developed by the Northrop Corporation for the United States Army Air Forces during and shortly after World War II. The airplane used the radical and potentially very efficient flying wing design, in which the tail section and fuselage are eliminated and all payload is carried in a thick wing. Only prototypes and pre-production aircraft were built, although interest remained strong enough to warrant further development of the design as a jet bomber, under the designation YB-49.

==Design and development==
The B-35 was the brainchild of Jack Northrop, who made the flying wing the focus of his work during the 1930s. In 1941 before the USA entered World War II, Northrop and Consolidated Vultee Corporation had been commissioned to develop a large wing-only, long-range bomber designated XB-35 and XB-36. Northrop advocated a &quot;flying wing&quot; as a means of reducing parasitic drag and eliminating structural weight not directly responsible for producing lift. Consolidated Vultee proposed a more conventional design with fuselage and tail, which was much larger and heavier. In theory, the B-35 could carry a greater payload faster, farther, and cheaper than a conventional bomber.

In December 1941, the Army Air Forces awarded prototype contracts to both Northrop and Consolidated Vultee for a bomber that could carry of bombs to a round-trip mission of . Requested performance was a maximum speed of , cruise speed of , and service ceiling of . This aircraft would be able to bomb Nazi-occupied Europe in the event that Britain fell (this was similar to Nazi Germany&#x27;s own &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; program design competition through the RLM, itself initiated in the spring of 1942). The original April 1941 USAAC proposal was first submitted to Boeing and Consolidated Aircraft Company and led to the production of the Convair B-36. In May, one month before the USAAF was created, the contract was also extended to include Northrop, inviting it to submit a design along the lines it was already exploring.

Since the new aircraft would require a significant amount of engineering work in untested waters, the first order placed was actually for two prototypes of the XB-35, and included Northrop&#x27;s plan to also build two all-wood one-third scale flying models to measure performance and stability; these were dubbed the Northrop N-9M (M standing for model). This aircraft would be used to gather flight test data on the Flying Wing design. Jack Northrop also hired part-time the leading aeronautical designer of the day Theodore von Kármán, to evaluate and who approved of Northrop&#x27;s initial design, and to start building the tooling for building the prototypes ... as explained in detail in the book &quot;Goodbye Beautiful Wing&quot; by Terrence O&#x27;Neill (). The N9Ms would also be used as a flight trainer, to familiarize pilots with the radical, all-wing concept.

Early in 1942, design work on the XB-35 itself began in earnest. Unlike conventional aircraft, truly &quot;tailless&quot; flying wings do not have a rudder for lateral control, so a set of clamshell-like, double split flaps (so-called flaperon, a portmanteau of flap and aileron) on the trailing edge of the wingtips were used. When aileron control was input, they were deflected up or down as a single unit, just like an aileron. When rudder input was made, the two surfaces on one side opened, top and bottom, creating drag, and yawing the aircraft. By applying input to both rudder pedals, both sets of surfaces were deployed creating drag so that the airspeed or the glide angle could be manipulated.

==Variants==

===XB-35===
On 22 November 1941, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF, or AAF) signed the development contract for an XB-35; the contract included an option for a second aircraft, which was exercised on 2 January 1942. The first was to be delivered in November 1943, the second in April of the next year.

Detailed engineering began in early 1942. A fuselage-like crew cabin was to be embedded inside the wing; it included a tail cone protruding from the trailing edge. This tail cone would contain the remote sighting stations for the bomber&#x27;s gunners and a cluster of rear-firing machine guns in the production aircraft. In the midsection of the cabin, there were folding bunks for off-duty crew on long missions. The aircraft&#x27;s bomb load was to be carried in six smaller bomb bays, three in each wing section, fitted with roll-away doors; this original design precluded the carrying of large bombs, and the early atomic bombs, without bomb bay redesign and modifications. Production aircraft would have defensive armament of twenty machine guns or 20 mm cannon, carried in six turrets, two turrets along the aircraft&#x27;s center line, four above and below the outer wings, and four in the &quot;stinger&quot; tail cone. The B-35 would take advantage of a new aluminum alloy devised by Alcoa; it was considerably stronger than any alloy used previously.

In June 1946, the XB-35 made its first flight, a 45-minute trip from Hawthorne, California, to Muroc Dry Lake, without incident. The XB-35&#x27;s engines and propellers were AAF property and had not been tested for engine-propeller compatibility by either Pratt &amp; Whitney, Hamilton Standard, or by the AAF which bought them at Wright Field without testing them or assuring reliability, and then shipped them to Northrop. Microfilmed records of reports and correspondence of the XB-35 program relate that after three or four flights, power plant and propeller vibrations increased, and the very efficient contra-rotating propellers began failing with frustrating frequency. Meetings were called by Northrop, of the AAF, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Hamilton Standard where no one would take responsibility for correcting the AAF&#x27;s engines and propellers. In addition, the AAF failed to supply the AC electrical alternator, insisting on Northrop using an onboard auxiliary power unit (APU) unit driven by an automotive engine which limited the high-altitude, high-speed XB-35 to test flights below . The AAF also refused to allow Northrop proposed modification of the bomb bays to carry the standard Mk. 3 atomic bomb, while at the same time declaring the AF would not buy the bomber unless it could carry the A-bomb. Northrop reluctantly agreed to try a single-rotation propeller, which slightly increased takeoff distance and a reduced rate-of-climb and maximum speed.

Problems with the quartet of contra-rotating propellers&#x27; shafts comprising each aircraft&#x27;s drive-line system continued until finally Jack Northrop himself grounded the XB-35s until the government fixed their propulsion system. Concurrently, the AAF ordered Northrop to convert two of the YB-35 airframes to YB-49s, essentially substituting eight jet engines for four reciprocating engines. As a result, the airframe promptly flew to more than and topped in flight tests, verifying the XB-35 air frame&#x27;s aerodynamics, but at the price of range. The prop-version had a design range capable of reaching targets away, but the jet-engine version&#x27;s range was cut nearly in half. The new version disqualified it for the Air Force&#x27;s top-priority mission as a strategic bomber, which at that time meant striking at the USSR&#x27;s industrial and military complexes in the Ural Mountains. The Air Force, itself involved in a confusion of rank and job changes, eventually cancelled the XB-35 project, while continuing testing the B-35 airframe as the YB-49, even ordering 30 of the jet-powered bombers after the first YB-49 crashed. The first and second XB-35s were scrapped on 23 and 19 August 1949, respectively.

===YB-35===
On 30 September 1943, 13 pre-production YB-35s were ordered by the Army Air Force. The first one did not fly until 15 May 1948. While some Air Force generals felt the piston engines made the B-35 obsolete, it remained superior in overall performance and range to its competitor, the Convair B-36, and General Hoyt Vandenberg wrote that only the B-35 and the B-36 had adequate range for the Air Force&#x27;s primary mission, and nothing comparable would be available until the mid-1950s. Only the first YB-35 was ever flown. Multiple flight testing demonstrated that it was airworthy; it was then parked and ignored for more than a year until being scrapped on 20 July 1949. The unfinished YB-35 #2, was scrapped almost a month later, on 19 August 1949. The other 11 of 13 YB-35 aircraft ordered underwent conversion to other power plants.

===YB-49===
Two of those airframes were converted to use eight Allison J35 jet engines and designated YB-49. The second YB-35 converted to a YB-49 all-jet airframe crashed after Air Force test pilot Forbes pulled the outer wing panels off during stall tests at . The first YB-35 airframe jet-modified to a YB-49 completed all stall tests and even demonstrated recovery from a spin. It was later destroyed after the Flying Wing&#x27;s forward landing gear strut and wheel collapsed after encountering high vibration during a highly unusual taxi test procedure made with the engine&#x27;s fuel tanks full, causing a fire that spread rapidly. Seven incomplete airframes began conversion to jet power as YB-49B but were never finished.

===YRB-49A===
A third YB-35 airframe was converted to use six jet engines (two placed in under wing pods) for use as a long-range reconnaissance aircraft, designated YRB-49A. After only a few months, the Air Force&#x27;s order for 30 YRB-49As was suddenly cancelled without explanation. The sole YRB-49A built flew 13 test flights and then was returned to Northrop&#x27;s Ontario Airport. The last of Northrop&#x27;s big Flying Wings sat abandoned at the airport&#x27;s edge for two years and was finally ordered scrapped on 1 December 1953.

===EB-35B===
In order to test the advanced Northrop T37 Turbodyne turboprop engine, produced by a Northrop subsidiary, the ultimate YB-35A was to be converted to a single EB-35B test aircraft (in this case the prefix &quot;E&quot; for the designation meant &quot;Exempt,&quot; not the later Electronic). The test aircraft would use two of the powerful T37 engines, each driving a pair of contra-rotating, paddle-blade propellers; the first planned ground tests were to be made using a single T37 engine. When the EB-35B project was canceled, the Air Force had Northrop&#x27;s Turbodyne engine name, all its patents, and technical data reassigned to General Electric.

===XB2T===
The XB2T-1 was a U.S. Navy designation for one YB-35 airframe to be used for development trials; the project was canceled while still in the planning stage.

==Operational history==
The U.S. Army Air Forces had originally ordered 200 production model B-35s. Since Northrop&#x27;s facilities were not up to the task of producing them, the Glenn L. Martin Company agreed to undertake mass production. This proved irrelevant when the aircraft had too many development problems. Even disregarding these, so many of Martin&#x27;s engineers had been drafted by 1944 that Martin pushed the first delivery date back to 1947. Seeing that it would almost certainly never be ready in time for the war, the Army Air Forces canceled the production contract, though the Air Technical Services Command continued to run the program for research purposes.

Actual flight tests of the aircraft revealed several problems: the contra-rotating props caused constant heavy drive-shaft vibration and the government-supplied gearboxes had frequent malfunctions and reduced the effectiveness of propeller control. After only 19 flights, Northrop grounded the first XB-35; the second aircraft was grounded after eight test flights. During this time, the contra-rotating propellers were removed and replaced with four-blade single-rotation propellers. In addition to having continued drive shaft vibration problems, the new single-rotation props greatly reduced the aircraft&#x27;s speed and performance. Furthermore, the intricate exhaust system turned into a fiasco to maintain. After only two years of use, the engines already showed signs of metal fatigue.

In the end, the program was terminated due to its technical difficulties and the obsolescence of its reciprocating propeller engines, and the fact it was far behind schedule and over budget. Another contributing factor to the program&#x27;s failure was the tendency of Northrop to become engaged in many experimental programs, which spread its small engineering staff far too wide. While the competing propeller-driven B-36 was obsolete by that time and had just as many or even more development problems, the Air Force needed a very long-range, post-war atomic bomber to counter the perceived Soviet threat. It had more faith that the B-36&#x27;s &quot;teething&quot; problems could be overcome, compared to those of the new and radical &quot;Flying Wing&quot;, the unofficial name that was later associated with all the Northrop &quot;all-wing&quot; designs.

There are long-standing conspiracy theories about the cancellation of the Flying Wing program; specifically, an accusation from Jack Northrop that Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington attempted to coerce him to merge his company with the Atlas Corporation-controlled Convair. In a 1979 taped interview, Jack Northrop claimed the Flying Wing contract was cancelled because he would not agree to a merger because Convair&#x27;s merger demands were &quot;grossly unfair to Northrop.&quot; When Northrop refused, Symington supposedly arranged to cancel the B-35 and B-49 program. Symington became president of Convair after he left government service a short time later.

Other observers note that the B-35 and B-49 designs had well-documented performance and design issues while the Convair B-36 needed more development money. At that time, it appeared the B-36 program might be cancelled as well as the B-35. The USAF and the Texas Congressional delegation desired to have a production program for the large Fort Worth aircraft production factory, and Convair had much more effective lobbyists in Washington, DC. The Northrop Corporation was always a technological trailblazer, but the independent nature of Jack Northrop often collided with the political wheeling-and-dealing in Washington that tended to run huge military allocations. Consequently, the B-36 prevailed, with just over 380 aircraft built. Furthermore, earlier the same year, when the YB-49 jet bomber was cancelled, Northrop received a smaller production contract for its F-89 Scorpion fighter as compensation for the lost Flying Wing contract.

<doc id="566032" wikidata="Q7178866" url="?curid=566032" title="Petro Georgiou">
<text>Petro Georgiou AO (born 30 November 1947) is a Greek Australian politician who was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from November 1994 to July 2010, representing the Division of Kooyong, Victoria.

==Early life==
Born in Greece, Georgiou was educated at Melbourne University. He was a senior tutor in politics at La Trobe University 1970–73, Senior Adviser to Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser 1975–79, Secretary of the Ethnic Television Review Panel 1979–80, Director of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs 1980–85, Senior Adviser to the Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Peacock, 1985, Director of the Victorian Liberal Policy Unit 1985–89 and State Director of the Victorian Liberal Party 1989–94. Georgiou battled Opposition leader John Hewson to exempt food from the 15%GST he proposed at the Federal election in 1993 which the Liberals lost and more than likely would&#x27;ve lost more had Georgiou&#x27;s suggestion not been taken.
Georgiou would later work for Hewson as his chief of staff until Hewson was replaced by Alexander Downer following a leadership spill.

==Parliament==
Upon the resignation of former Liberal leader Andrew Peacock, Georgiou was preselected to contest the 1994 Kooyong by-election for the Liberal Party. He won the safe Liberal seat on 64 per cent of the two-party vote against the main contender, the Greens. He was only the fourth member for this blue-ribbon non-Labor seat in 72 years.

In 2005, Georgiou was one of a small number of Liberal parliamentarians who expressed disagreement with the government&#x27;s policy of mandatory detention for asylum seekers. He began speaking out against the policy in June and began drafting a private member&#x27;s bill aimed at softening the policy. On 17 June, Prime Minister John Howard announced a shift in that policy, allowing families in detention with children to enter the community and ensuring that long-term detainees would have their cases reviewed regularly. Georgiou was given a large amount of credit for the policy change.

On 11 August 2006, Georgiou joined Russell Broadbent and Judi Moylan in crossing the floor to vote against the &quot;Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill&quot;, that would force all asylum seekers to be processed offshore.

===Preselection challenge===
In March 2006, Josh Frydenberg, an investment banker and former political adviser, made known his intention to challenge Georgiou for his seat in an internal Liberal Party preselection. This followed another prominent Liberal former Victorian president Michael Kroger&#x27;s decision not to contest the seat. Liberal deputy leader Peter Costello endorsed Georgiou and Kroger is believed to have supported him.

In the days leading to the preselection convention, Queensland frontbenchers Ian Macfarlane, Peter Dutton and Santo Santoro backed Frydenberg&#x27;s credentials, to the dismay of former premier Jeff Kennett.
The preselection was held at Trinity Grammar School on 23 April 2006.
 Georgiou retained selection by receiving 62 of the 85 Liberal Party delegates&#x27; votes, with challenger Frydenberg receiving 22 votes and a third candidate, Alistair Armstrong, receiving one vote.

===Retirement===
On 22 November 2008, Georgiou announced he would retire at the 2010 federal election. His valedictory speech to the House of Representatives criticised both major parties regarding their immigration policies. He was the first member for this blue-ribbon Liberal seat in more than a century to spend his entire career on the backbench; since 1910, all of his predecessors had served long spells as either cabinet ministers or opposition frontbenchers. Howard offered Georgiou a parliamentary secretary position in 1998, but he turned it down.

==Honours==
In the 2013 Queens Birthday Honours, Petro Georgiou was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) &quot;For distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, to multiculturalism and human rights advocacy, and to the community.&quot;

<text>is the daily newspaper of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) in the form of a national newspaper. It was founded in 1928 and currently has both daily and weekly editions.

&quot;Akahata&quot; has journalists based in the capitals of ten countries around the globe. They are Beijing, Berlin, Cairo, Hanoi, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Paris, and Washington, D.C. &quot;Japan Press Weekly&quot; is the newspaper&#x27;s English edition.

== History ==
The newspaper was founded in 1928, six years after the establishment of the JCP. It was banned in Japan because it was viewed as subversive, forcing it to operate underground. The newspaper was legalized along with the JCP during the American occupation of Japan.

== Content ==
Some of their journalism deals with activist politics, but they also do original reporting on a wide variety of political issues which are often untouched in Japan. Most Japanese newspapers publish the names of alleged criminals, but &quot;Akahata&quot; often declines to publish their names, unless they are related to organized crime or right-wing activities. They also go out of their way to avoid using polite terms for the Emperor of Japan; for example, the paper refers to the Emperor&#x27;s Cup exclusively as &quot;a Japanese soccer tournament&quot;. They refer to the Buraku Liberation League as the &quot;Liberation&quot; League, using scare quotes to convey their opposition to the group.

== Circulation over time ==
In 1959, &quot;Akahata&quot; had a daily circulation of around 40,000. By the end of 1960, as a result of recruitment drives conducted in conjunction with the 1960 Anpo Protests, circulation soared to around 100,000. By 1970, the newspaper had over 400,000 subscribers to its daily edition, and more than 1 million subscribers to its Sunday edition. In the early 1990s, daily subscribers were over 3 million. However, by 2007, daily circulation had fallen to around 1.6 million, and fell further to around 1.0 million by 2019. , it has a circulation of 850,000.

<doc id="566036" wikidata="Q268543" url="?curid=566036" title="77 Sunset Strip">
<text>77 Sunset Strip was an American television private detective drama series created by Roy Huggins and starring Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Roger Smith, Richard Long (from 1960 to 1961) and Edd Byrnes (billed as Edward Byrnes). Each episode was one hour long when aired with commercials. The show ran from 1958 to 1964.
The character of detective Stuart Bailey was first used by writer Huggins in his 1946 novel &quot;The Double Take&quot;, later adapted into the 1948 film &quot;I Love Trouble&quot;.

==Description==
===Initial setup and characters===

Private detective and former World War II Office of Strategic Services secret agent and foreign languages professor Stuart (&quot;Stu&quot;) Bailey (Zimbalist) and former government agent and nonpracticing attorney Jeff Spencer (Smith) form a duo who work from stylish offices at 77 Sunset Boulevard in Suites 101 and 102. Tab Hunter claimed he was the first choice for the lead of the series, but turned it down.

The street address was colloquially known as the Sunset Strip and was between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road on the south side of the strip, next door to Dean Martin&#x27;s real-life lounge, Dino&#x27;s Lodge. Typically the two detectives would alternate as leads, with a Stuart Bailey case being featured one week and a Jeff Spencer case the next—although depending on the nature of the case, sometimes the two would team up.

Suzanne Fabry, the beautiful French switchboard operator played by Jacqueline Beer, handles the phones for Sunset Answering Service, in Suite 103. The firm of Bailey &amp; Spencer employs her answering service, as do other clients. Although not technically an employee of the firm, Suzanne is involved in casework from time to time, especially in Season 2.

Comic relief is provided by Roscoe the racetrack tout (played by Louis Quinn), who frequently hangs around the offices giving horse-racing tips. However he is sometimes used as an operative and is an ever-informed source for the word on the street.

The firm&#x27;s most frequently seen police contact is Lt. Roy Gilmore (Byron Keith), who is almost never called by his first name.

The show&#x27;s breakout character, who had not been included in the pilot film, was Gerald Lloyd &quot;Kookie&quot; Kookson III (Edd Byrnes), the rock and roll-loving, wisecracking, hair-combing hipster and aspiring PI who initially works as the valet parking attendant at Dino&#x27;s, the club next to the detectives&#x27; office. Kookie often becomes involved in the firm&#x27;s cases and is eventually made a full partner in the firm, with his own office.

Also seen relatively frequently are the Frank Ortega Trio, playing themselves as the jazzy house band at Dino&#x27;s Lodge.

===Tone and cultural impact===

Huggins intended the show to be a hard-edged drama, but beginning with the 23rd episode, &quot;The Pasadena Caper&quot;, the tone started to become much lighter, with a strong element of self-deprecating humor and the word &quot;caper&quot; frequently used in episode titles. The catchy theme song, written by Mack David and Jerry Livingston, typified the show&#x27;s breezy, jazzed atmosphere. The song became the centerpiece of an album of the show&#x27;s music in Warren Barker orchestrations, which was released in 1959, a top-10 hit in the &quot;Billboard&quot; LP charts.

The Kookie character became a cultural phenomenon, with his slang expressions such as &quot;ginchy&quot; (cool) and &quot;piling up Zs&quot; (sleeping). When Kookie helped the detectives on a case by singing a song, Edd Byrnes began a singing career with the novelty single &quot;Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)&quot;, based on his frequent combing of his hair; this featured Connie Stevens on vocals in the chorus and the song, with words and music by Irving Taylor, became the first hit single for the recently established Warner Bros. Records. Kookie was also used to provide product placement for Harley-Davidson, appearing on their Topper motor scooter in the show and in Harley-Davidson advertisements.

The show became the first &quot;franchise&quot; in television, spawning no fewer than three spinoffs recreating the &quot;77&quot; format, a team of private detectives, their secretary and sidekick, solving cases, in picturesque cities. &quot;Surfside Six&quot; was set in Miami Beach; &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;″s home base was Honolulu. &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot; saw a similar detective agency located in &quot;New Orleans&quot;. In some cases,&quot;77&quot; scripts were recycled and rewritten to fit the characters of each series. It was the genesis of the concept that drives contemporary shows such as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;&quot; and the &quot;Chicago P.D./Chicago Med/Chicago Fire&quot; series, as well as &quot;9-1-1&quot;.

===Cast changes during Seasons 1–5===
When Byrnes&#x27; demands for more money and an expanded role were not met, he left the show for a period in Season 2. After an absence of 16 episodes beginning in January 1960, Byrnes and Warner Bros. settled their differences, and Kookie came back beginning in May. (During his absence, Roscoe&#x27;s and Suzanne&#x27;s roles were beefed up to handle the work normally assigned to Kookie.)

For the 1960–61 season, Richard Long (who appeared in different roles in two Season 1 episodes) moved over from the recently canceled detective series &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;. His character of Rex Randolph from &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot; was said to have left New Orleans and relocated to North Hollywood, joining Bailey and Spencer&#x27;s firm and taking Office 104. The character was dropped after one season, but Long (once again playing different one-shot guest characters) was seen again on &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; in Seasons 5 and 6.

Kookie became a full-fledged detective and partner in the firm as of Season 4, taking over Rex Randolph&#x27;s office in 104. At the same time, Robert Logan became the new parking-lot attendant, J.R. Hale, who usually speaks in abbreviations. Hale is seen throughout Seasons 4 and 5.

===Episode and guest cast highlights===
One of the series&#x27; more unusual episodes was 1960&#x27;s &quot;The Silent Caper&quot;, written by Smith. As the title suggests, the episode presented its story completely without dialogue. Another offbeat entry was 1961&#x27;s &quot;Reserved for Mr. Bailey&quot;, which finds Zimbalist alone in a ghost town. He is the only main actor on screen for the entire hour. (This episode was not included in the syndication package, and many fans had expressed their frustration at being unable to see it again. After 56 years out of circulation, it finally resurfaced on MeTV on June 17, 2017.)

The show was so popular that rising young actors clamored for guest spots. Up-and-comers who made guest appearances include: Ellen Burstyn, Roger Moore, DeForest Kelley, William Shatner, Mary Tyler Moore, Shirley MacLaine look-alike Gigi Verone, Robert Conrad, Dyan Cannon, Janet De Gore, Jay North, Connie Stevens, Irish McCalla, Adam West, Tuesday Weld, Sherry Jackson, Marlo Thomas, Max Baer Jr., Carole Mathews, Elizabeth Montgomery, Karen Steele, Randy Stuart, Susan Oliver, Robert Vaughn, Suzanne Storrs, Peter Breck, Donna Douglas, Troy Donahue, Chad Everett, Gena Rowlands, Cloris Leachman, Eve McVeagh, and Diane Ladd.

Established film and TV actors and older stars who guest-starred include Fay Wray, Francis X. Bushman, Rodolfo Hoyos Jr., Ida Lupino, Liliane Montevecchi, Keenan Wynn, Rolfe Sedan, Jim Backus, Billie Burke, Buddy Ebsen, George Jessel, Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, Burgess Meredith, Nick Adams, Gerald Mohr and Roy Roberts, among others. The show occasionally featured sports stars such as Sandy Koufax in guest roles.

==The controversial sixth season, 1963–1964==

In 1963, as the show&#x27;s popularity waned, the entire cast was dismissed except for Zimbalist. Jack Webb was brought in as executive producer and William Conrad as a producer/director. The character of Stuart Bailey was presented as a solo private investigator, with no continuity or reference to his past years with Jeff Spencer, Suzanne, Kookie and Roscoe or to his military OSS background. It was an abrupt, unexplained disconnect; the new &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; was virtually an entirely different show that just happened to use the same title and lead character name, although the lead character was now very different. The series and Bailey&#x27;s personality took on a darker tone, and the familiar office, parking lot and Dino&#x27;s Lodge were gone. A new musical theme was written by Bob Thompson.

The Season 6 show title was not changed; it still was an address, but Bailey&#x27;s new office is dramatically different from that which he shared with Spencer for the previous five years. The interior of Bailey&#x27;s new office building is shown behind the show&#x27;s opening and closing credits, forcing viewers to ponder how the same address could look so very different (it was actually the historic Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles). There seemed to be no spoken mention of his office address in the Season 6 shows, although in the episode &quot;Bonus Baby&quot; when a police officer inspects Bailey&#x27;s private investigator license, a close-up shows the address &quot;77 Sunset Strip.&quot;

As the season progressed, there were some shifts in tone. Several episodes into the season, Bailey&#x27;s stern personality became lighter, though still different from that of prior seasons. His secretary Hannah, previously known to Season 6 viewers only because Bailey addressed her in his recorded dictations, was seen on screen beginning with the season&#x27;s 11th episode. Played by Joan Staley, Hannah worked in Bailey&#x27;s office, where he developed a romantic interest in her—but she continually stymied and frustrated him by playing hard-to-get.

As of episode &quot;Alimony League&quot; (the 16th of the season&#x27;s 20 episodes), the opening and closing background of Bradbury building was gone, replaced by Bailey in silhouette walking past lighted store windows. This was actually a scene from &quot;5&quot; (the sixth-season opener) and it was supposedly located in New York City where Bailey arrived to work for a client to &quot;pay his dead brother&#x27;s way into heaven.&quot;

The episode &quot;The Target&quot; was unusual because key roles were played by the show&#x27;s primary behind-the-scenes crew, who happened to also be experienced actors. Show producer William Conrad played Maestrian, associate producer James Lydon played Charlie, writer Tony Barrett played Carnovan and director Lawrence Dobkin played Landers.

Viewers did not appreciate the numerous changes to the show, and it was canceled halfway through its sixth season in February 1964. In the 1964 summer reruns period, shows from the Bailey and Spencer years were shown, and the Season 6 episodes were abandoned, rarely seen until September 2017 on MeTV.

==Related shows==
The success of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; led to the creation of several other detective shows in exotic locales, all produced by the Warner Bros. studio, which created &quot;Strip&quot; — &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot; in New Orleans with Richard Long and Andrew Duggan, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; in Honolulu with Robert Conrad and Connie Stevens, and &quot;Surfside 6&quot; in Miami Beach with Troy Donahue and Van Williams. The casts and scripts of these various shows sometimes crossed over, which was logistically easy, since they were all shot in Burbank on the Warner Bros. lot. Some of the detectives, played by the same actors, became regulars in other series after their original series had been cancelled.

The office and bar/nightclub sets of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; and &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; were on the same WB soundstage, intertwined to save space, with shared room walls and some doors actually going between the sets (not obvious to viewers).

==Legacy==

An engraving in the Sunset Boulevard sidewalk (address number 8524) between La Cienega Boulevard and Alta Loma Road commemorated &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, but the area was slated for redevelopment as part of the Sunset Millennium project. In a twist of fate, the opposition to the redevelopment of the area was known as &quot;Save Our Strip&quot; or &quot;SOS&quot; and was spearheaded by former &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; semiregular Gigi Verone. No number 77 exists on the Strip, as all Sunset Boulevard addresses in the area have four digits. When looked for in January 2023, no trace of the sidewalk engraving remained.

The show was referenced in an episode of Jay Ward&#x27;s &quot;Fractured Flickers&quot;, showing a satirical depiction of Ward looking at a lineup of fictional shows, one of them being &quot;77 Gaza Strip.&quot;

Episodes of the television series can be seen in reruns through syndication packages offered by Warner Bros. Studios. At one time, 43 episodes had been removed from syndication for various legal reasons, but 13 of these can now be seen as reruns. As of 2017, the syndication package aired on Me-TV contained every original episode.

Thirty-one years after the series left the air, Warner Bros. proposed a modern revival of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, which was to be the first hour-long drama series to air on the new WB Television Network. It was to be produced by Clint Eastwood and starred Jim Caviezel, Timothy Olyphant and Maria Bello. A 25-minute pilot presentation was shot for upfronts in the spring of 1997, but despite a few attempts to modify and finalize it for broadcast in 1997–1998, the project never made it past the testing stage. Early mentions of the show were made in the network&#x27;s fall affiliate presentation promotion, with the &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; logo visible in the movie backlot motif.

<doc id="566037" wikidata="Q1194075" url="?curid=566037" title="Northrop YB-49">
<text>The Northrop YB-49 was an American prototype jet-powered heavy bomber developed by Northrop Corporation shortly after World War II for service with the United States Air Force. The YB-49 featured a flying wing design and was a turbojet-powered development of the earlier, piston-engined Northrop XB-35 and YB-35. The two YB-49s built were both converted YB-35 test aircraft.

The YB-49 never entered production, being passed over in favor of the more conventional Convair B-36 piston-driven design. Design work performed in the development of the YB-35 and YB-49 nonetheless proved to be valuable to Northrop decades later in the eventual development of the B-2 stealth bomber, which entered service in the early 1990s.

==Design and development==

With the XB-35 program seriously behind schedule by 1944, and the end of piston-engined combat aircraft in sight, the production contract for this propeller-driven type was cancelled in May of that year. Nevertheless, the Flying Wing design was still sufficiently interesting to the Air Force that work was continued on testing a single YB-35A production aircraft.

Among the aircraft later completed were two airframes that the Air Force ordered be fitted with jet propulsion and designated as YB-49s. The first of these new YB-49 jet-powered aircraft flew on 22 October 1947 (from Northrop airfield in Hawthorne, CA) and immediately proved more promising than its piston engined counterpart. The YB-49 set an unofficial endurance record of staying continually above 40,000 ft (12,200 m) for 6.5 hours.

The second YB-49 was lost when it crashed on June 5, 1948, killing its pilot, Major Daniel Forbes (for whom Forbes Air Force Base was named), co-pilot Captain Glen Edwards (for whom Edwards Air Force Base is named), and three other crew members, one of whom, 1st Lieutenant Edward Lee Swindell, was a crew member on the Boeing B-29 that assisted Chuck Yeager in breaking the sound barrier in the Bell X-1 aircraft. Their aircraft suffered structural failure, with both outer wing sections becoming detached from the center section. Speculation at the time was that the YB-49 was lost due to excessive pullout loads imposed on the heavy airframe when a scheduled flight test of the large bomber&#x27;s stall recovery resulted in a sudden and dramatic high-speed, nose-over dive. The post-stall high-speed dive resulted from the clean, low-drag, all-wing design, which gave the YB-49 a rapid speed increase in any type of dive. Fellow YB-49 test pilot Robert Cardenas later claimed that the YB-49 rotated backwards in stall, and that he warned Edwards about it. Jack Northrop later countered that such a behavior was impossible for the all-wing design.

During flight tests in the 1940s, it was noticed that the aircraft had a small radar cross-section, due to its flying wing design. Decades later, this stealthy detail would prove crucial to the design of Northrop Grumman&#x27;s advanced, all-wing B-2 bomber.

On 9 February 1949, the first YB-49 flew from Muroc Air Force Base in California to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., in 4 hours 25 minutes, after which President Truman ordered a flyby of Pennsylvania Avenue at rooftop level. The return flight from Andrews was marred when four of the eight engines had to be shut down due to oil starvation. Inspection after a successful emergency landing at Winslow Airport, Arizona, revealed no oil had been replaced in these engines at Wright after the Muroc-to-Andrews leg, raising a suspicion of industrial sabotage.

The last operational YB-49 prototype was destroyed on 15 March 1950, during high-speed taxi trials at Muroc Field. The nose wheel began to encounter severe vibration problems and finally collapsed; the aircraft was completely destroyed in the ensuing fire. The taxi trials took place with the YB-49&#x27;s fuel tanks full, an unusual testing procedure, fanning further speculation of industrial sabotage of the aircraft.

Bombing target tests showed a tendency of flying wings to &quot;hunt&quot; in yaw after turns and when flying in &quot;disturbed&quot; air, degrading bombing accuracy. It was thought that one of the new Honeywell autopilots, with yaw damping, would correct this flaw. Northrop chief test pilot on the YB-35 and YB-49 programs Max Stanley contends in the 1992 Discovery Channel documentary &quot;The Wing Will Fly&quot;, the adaptation of the autopilot in this dual function &quot;damped out the directional oscillations to the degree where... I think you would say it met the (military) specifications.&quot; Brig. General Robert Cardenas also flew the YB-49 during many of its test flights, praising the aircraft for its marvelous performance, while also noting the YB-49 required a very long bomb run to damp directional oscillations. Many of these challenges would eventually be overcome when fly-by-wire systems were developed in the 1950s, which were first used in regular production for the Convair B-58 Hustler and then when computer-generated artificial stability became available in the 1970s, culminating in the development of the all-wing Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber.

The conversion of the long-range XB-35 to jet power essentially cut the effective range of the aircraft in half, putting it in the medium-range bomber category with Boeing&#x27;s new swept-winged jet bomber the B-47 Stratojet. The B-47 was optimized for high-altitude and high-speed flight and, in an era where speed and altitude were becoming increasingly important, the YB-49&#x27;s thick airfoil could never be maximized for high-speed performance. In the same &quot;Discovery Channel&quot; documentary, former Air Force Flight Test Center Historian Dr. James Young states his opinion that while political gamesmanship and back room dealing certainly played a role in the aircraft&#x27;s demise, the Flying Wing program was ultimately cancelled for solid technological reasons.

==Operational history==
In June 1948, the Air Force ordered the type into full production as the &quot;RB-49A&quot; reconnaissance aircraft (company designations N-38 and N-39). It was powered by six jet engines, two of them externally mounted in under-wing pods, ruining the aircraft&#x27;s sleek, aerodynamic lines, but extending its range by carrying additional fuel. The use of jet engines had resulted in considerably increased fuel consumption and decreased its range significantly below that of the rival Convair B-36. One YB-35 airframe (s/n 42-102369) was chosen as the prototype for the RB-49 and designated &quot;YRB-49A&quot;.

During early 1950, the remaining YB-35Bs airframes, which were being converted to YRB-49As, were ordered scrapped. Flight testing of the sole remaining YB-49 prototype ended 14 March 1950. On 15 March 1950, that program was canceled. Coincidentally, the sole remaining YB-49 prototype suffered a high-speed taxiing accident and, as previously noted, was totally destroyed in the ensuing fire.

Only two months later, all Flying Wing contracts were canceled abruptly without explanation by order of Stuart Symington, Secretary of the Air Force.

All remaining Flying Wing bomber airframes, except for the sole YRB-49A reconnaissance version, were ordered chopped up by Symington, the materials smelted down using portable smelters brought to Northrop&#x27;s facility, in plain sight of its employees. Jack Northrop retired from both the company he founded and aviation shortly after he saw his dream of a pure, all-wing aircraft destroyed. His son, John Northrop Jr., later recounted during an interview his father&#x27;s devastation and lifelong suspicion that his Flying Wing project had been sabotaged by political influence and back room wheeling-and-dealing between Convair and the Air Force.

The sole prototype reconnaissance platform, the YRB-49A, first flew on 4 May 1950. After only 13 flights, testing ended abruptly on 26 April 1951. It was then flown back to Northrop&#x27;s headquarters from Edwards Air Force Base (formerly Muroc AAF) on what would be its last flight. There, this remaining flying wing sat abandoned at the edge of Northrop&#x27;s Ontario airport for more than two years. It was finally ordered scrapped on 1 December 1953.

In a 1979 videotaped news interview, Jack Northrop broke his long silence and said publicly that all Flying Wing contracts had been canceled because Northrop Aircraft Corporation refused to merge with competitor Convair at Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington&#x27;s strong suggestion, because, according to Jack Northrop, Convair&#x27;s merger demands were &quot;grossly unfair to Northrop.&quot; Allegations of political influences in the cancellation of the Flying Wing were investigated by the House Armed Services Committee, where Symington publicly denied exerting pressure on Northrop to merge.

Northrop&#x27;s Flying Wing program may have been terminated due to its technical difficulties and the program being behind schedule and over budget. Another possible contributing factor to the cancellation may have been Northrop spreading its small engineering staff too widely in other experimental programs. While the competing propeller-driven Convair B-36 &quot;Peacemaker&quot; was an obsolete World War II-era design by this time, and had been having just as many or even more development problems, the Air Force seemed to have greater confidence that its more conventional design and &quot;teething&quot; problems could be overcome, when compared to those of the more radical Flying Wing. While the YB-49 had well-documented performance and design issues, the B-36 program needed more development money. When the YB-49 jet bomber was canceled, Northrop was awarded a much smaller, lower profile production contract for its straight-winged F-89 Scorpion fighter as compensation for the canceled Flying Wing.

The YB-49 and its modern counterpart, the B-2 Spirit, both built either by Northrop or Northrop Grumman, have the same wingspan: 172.0 ft (52.4 m). Flight test data collected from the original YB-49 test flights were used in the development of the B-2 bomber. Shortly before his death in February 1981, Jack Northrop learned from the Northrop Corporation of the company&#x27;s flying wing bid for the future B-2; he remarked: &quot;I know why God has kept me alive for the past 25 years.&quot; The new bomber would be publicly displayed for the first time in 1988.

==Notable appearances in media==
Paramount Pictures&#x27; 1953 film, &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, depicts a YB-49 dropping an atomic bomb on the invading Martians. The feature film, produced by George Pal and directed by Byron Haskin, incorporates Northrop color footage of a YB-49 test flight, originally used in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;Popular Science&quot; theatrical shorts of the era.

<text>Centaurea cyanus, commonly known as cornflower or bachelor&#x27;s button, is an annual flowering plant in the family Asteraceae native to Europe. In the past, it often grew as a weed in cornfields (in the broad sense of &quot;corn&quot;, referring to grains, such as wheat, barley, rye, or oats), hence its name. It is now endangered in its native habitat by agricultural intensification, particularly by over-use of herbicides. However, &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is now also naturalised in many other parts of the world, including North America and parts of Australia through introduction as an ornamental plant in gardens and as a seed contaminant in crop seeds.

==Description==

&quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is an annual plant growing to tall, with grey-green branched stems. The leaves are lanceolate and long. The flowers are most commonly an intense blue colour and arranged in flowerheads (capitula) of 1.5–3 cm diameter, with a ring of a few large, spreading ray florets surrounding a central cluster of disc florets. The blue pigment is protocyanin, which in roses is red. Fruits are approx. 3.5 mm long with 2–3 mm-long pappus bristles. It flowers all summer.

=== Genetics ===
&quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is a diploid flower (2n = 24). The genetic diversity within populations is high, although there could be a future decline in diversity due to population fragmentation and intensive agriculture. In general, &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is a self-incompatible species. However, selfing still occurs occasionally, but results in inbreeding depression.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is native to temperate Europe, but is widely naturalized outside its native range.

It has been present in Britain and Ireland as an archaeophyte (ancient introduction) since the Iron Age. In the United Kingdom, it has declined from 264 sites to just 3 sites in the last 50 years.

In reaction to this, the conservation charity Plantlife named it as one of 101 species it would actively work to bring &#x27;back from the brink&#x27;.

In the County Clare (VC H9) in Ireland, &quot;C. cyanus&quot; is recorded in arable fields as very rare and almost extinct, while in northeast Ireland, it was abundant before the 1930s.

== Ecology ==
=== Weed in arable crops ===
&quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is considered a noxious weed in arable crops, especially cereals and rapeseed. In winter wheat, one plant per m2 can cause a yield loss of up to 30 kg / ha. &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; produces around 800 seed per plant, which are either shed shortly before the harvest of cereals, or they are threshed together with the cereal grains, contributing to the further spread of the species by the harvesting machinery and contaminated seed. The occurrence of &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; strongly decreased during the last decades due to improved seed cleaning, more intensive nitrogen fertilization and herbicide use. However, &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; has become more common in cropland due to an increase in crop rotations dominated by winter cereals and rapeseed and the use of more selective herbicides with a low effectiveness against &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot;. In addition, the emergence of resistance against the herbicide class of sulfonylureas has been reported recently. Due to its strong roots, &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is difficult to control mechanically in spring.

=== Fodder for insects and birds ===

The pollen of &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is used by several different insect species. Insects of the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera are particularly attracted by the flower. As &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is a self-incompatible species, it needs external pollination. The nectar of &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is very sweet with a sugar content of 34%. Due to its high sugar production of up to 0.2 mg sugar per day and flower, the species is highly appreciated by beekeepers.

The seeds of &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; are one of the favourite foods of the European goldfinch.

=== Control of insect pests ===
&quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; was found to produce volatiles attracting &quot;Microplitis mediator&quot;, which is a major parasitoid of the cabbage moth (&quot;Mamestra brassicae&quot;), which is the most important pest of cabbage (&quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;) in central Europe. Planting &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; in cabbage fields as a companion plant was thus suggested as an alternative to the widespread use of insecticides to control &quot;Mamestra brassicae&quot;. Field experiments showed that planting &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; in cabbage fields at a density of 1 plant / m2 can result in a significant increase in parasitation of &quot;Mamestra brassicae&quot; larvae, predation of &quot;Mamestra brassicae&quot; eggs (e.g. by carabid beetles or spiders) and ultimately cabbage yield.

== Cultivation ==

Several cultivars of &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; with varying pastel colours, including pink and purple, have been selected for ornamental purposes. The species is also grown for the cut flower industry in Canada for use by florists. Doubled blue cultivars (such as &#x27;Blue Boy&#x27; or &#x27;Blue Diadem&#x27;) are most commonly used for this purpose, but white, pink, lavender and black (actually a very dark maroon) cultivars are also used, albeit to a lesser extent.

=== Breeding goals ===
As for all ornamental plants, important goals of &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; breeding include the induction of phenotypic variation (e.g. in flower coloration, size and shape, foliage characteristics or plant height), higher flower yield, resistance to pests and diseases as well as tolerance to abiotic stress (e.g., extreme temperatures, drought or salinity).
=== Soil and climate requirements ===
&quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; requires full sun and neutral (pH 6.6–7.5) to mildly alkaline (pH 7.6–7.8), moist and well-drained soil. However, &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is quite tolerant to drought once established.

=== Sowing ===
For summer-blooming plants, sowing should be executed in late spring. In moderate climates, however, it is also possible to sow Centaurea cyanus in early fall. In this case, plants will already start to flower in the following spring. Recommended spacing between plants is approx. 20 to 30 cm. &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; can germinate from up to 10 cm depth, but the best result is obtained at 1 cm sowing depth. Germination occurs quickly after sowing.

=== Fertilization and cultural practices ===
High phosphorus fertilization in mid-summer will increase flower production. Mulching is recommended to prevent drying out of the soil and exposure of the root system to the sun.

=== Pests and diseases ===
In general, &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is not very susceptible to pests and plant diseases. However, it may be affected by stem rot and stem rust if grown too tightly or by powdery mildew. Furthermore, aphids and leafhoppers can cause relevant damage to &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot;.

=== Seed harvesting ===
Seeds are harvested either by hand or, in an agricultural setting, with a seed harvesting machine. On average there are 97,000 seeds in a pound of cornflower seeds.

Hand collecting can be time-consuming and yields are rather low.

A seed harvesting machine is more efficient than collecting the seeds by hand, but it is costly. The main principle of such a machine is that it brushes the ripe seeds off the plant and creates a cross flow fan action that generates sufficient air velocity to hold and gather the seeds into the seed bunker.

=== Pruning ===
Deadheading will encourage the plant to produce more blooms. Cornflowers are often used for ornamental purposes and by cutting them, up to their third leaves, they will produce more blooms and grow a bigger stem.

==Uses==
===Culinary===

The flowers of &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; can be eaten raw, dried or cooked. Dried petals are used in foods, including in spices. Their main purpose is to add colour to food. There are cheeses or oils that contain raw petals. Petals can also be added to salads, drinks, and desserts for garnishing purposes in raw or dried form.

Dried petals are also used in teas and other beverages. Blue cornflower petals are sometimes one of the ingredients in Lady Grey tea.

===Medicine=== 
&quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; contains a wide range of pharmacologically active compounds, such as flavonoids, anthocyanins and aromatic acids. Especially the flower head finds application in herbal medicine, but leaves and seeds are also used for pharmacological purposes, albeit to a lesser extent.

In particular, extracts from the flower heads have anti-inflammatory properties used in the treatment of minor ocular inflammations. Antioxidant properties are high due to ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds. Furthermore, extracts of the flower head and vegetative parts of the plant were shown to have gastroprotective effects due to their content of quercetin, apigenin and caffeic acid derivates.

=== Pigment ===
The blue color of &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; is due to protocyanin, an anthocyanin pigment that is also found in roses. Different anthocyanins derived from &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; are used as natural additives in food products, such as yoghurts.

=== Phytoremediation ===
&quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot; has been evaluated for phytoremediation of soils contaminated with lead. Inoculation of the contaminated soil with &quot;Glomus spp.&quot; (fungus) and &quot;Pseudomonas spp.&quot; (bacterium) would significantly enhance the biomass production and lead uptake of &quot;Centaurea cyanus&quot;.

==In culture==
In folklore, cornflowers were worn by young men in love; if the flower faded too quickly, it was taken as a sign that the man&#x27;s love was not returned.

The blue cornflower was one of the national symbols of Germany. This is partly due to the story that when Queen Louise of Prussia was fleeing Berlin and pursued by Napoleon&#x27;s forces, she hid her children in a field of cornflowers and kept them quiet by weaving wreaths for them from the flowers. The flower thus became identified with Prussia, not least because it was the same color as the Prussian military uniform. After the unification of Germany in 1871, it went on to become a symbol of the country as a whole. For this reason, in Austria the blue cornflower is a political symbol for pan-German and rightist ideas. It was worn as a secret symbol identifying members of the then-illegal NSDAP in Austria in the 1930s. Members of the Freedom Party wore it at the openings of the Austrian parliament since 2006. After the last general election 2017 they replaced it with the edelweiss.

It was also the favourite flower of Louise&#x27;s son Kaiser Wilhelm I. Because of its ties to royalty, authors such as Theodor Fontane have used it symbolically, often sarcastically, to comment on the social and political climate of the time.

The cornflower is also often seen as an inspiration for the German Romantic symbol of the Blue Flower.

Due to its traditional association with Germany, the cornflower has been made the official symbol of the annual German-American Steuben Parade.
The blue cornflower has been the national flower of Estonia since 1969 and symbolizes daily bread to Estonians. It is also the symbol of the Estonian Conservative People&#x27;s Party.

It is also the symbol of the Finnish National Coalition Party, and the Liberal People&#x27;s Party of Sweden, where it has since the dawn of the 20th century been a symbol for social liberalism.

It is the official flower of the Swedish province of Östergötland and the school flower of Winchester College and also of Dulwich College, where it is said to have been the favourite flower of the founder, Edward Alleyn.

In France the is the symbol of the 11 November 1918 armistice and, as such, a common symbol for veterans (especially the now defunct poilus of World War I), similar to the Remembrance poppies worn in the United Kingdom and in Canada.

The cornflower is also the symbol for motor neurone disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Cornflowers are sometimes worn by Old Harrovians, former pupils of the British Harrow School.

A blue cornflower was used by Corning Glass Works for the initial release of Corning Ware Pyroceram cookware. Its popularity in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia was so high that it became the symbol of Corning Glass Works.

<text>The Rochester Americans (colloquially known as the Amerks) are a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League; the team is an owned and operated affiliate of the Buffalo Sabres. The team plays its home games in Rochester, New York, at the Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial. The Americans are the fourth oldest franchise in the AHL, and have the second longest continuous tenure among AHL teams in their current locations after the Hershey Bears.

Rochester was awarded a new franchise in June 1956, when the Pittsburgh Hornets were forced to suspend operations after their arena, the Duquesne Gardens was razed in an urban renewal project. With the Hornets franchise in limbo until a new arena could be built, there was room in the league for a team in Rochester.

The Americans&#x27; team colors are red, white and blue. The logo is a patriotic badge with &quot;Americans&quot; written in cursive script. They have won the Calder Cup six times, and lost in the Cup finals ten times.

==History==
===Before the Amerks===
Hockey was popular in Rochester, a city known for its cold weather, as far back as the 1920s; the University of Rochester had a collegiate hockey team as early as 1906, and even at that time, East High School had already developed a successful program. Professional hockey arrived in 1935 in the form of the Rochester Cardinals, a member of the International Hockey League. The Cardinals, who played at Edgerton Park Arena, lasted only one season, compiling a 15–29–3 record and a host of financial difficulties.

In the early 1950s, with the Rochester Community War Memorial under construction, Montreal Canadiens manager Frank Selke promised an American Hockey League team to Rochester at some point in the future, with 1956 one target year that was mentioned. Demonstrative of the support for hockey in Rochester, 7,092 fans turned out for a game between the AHL Buffalo Bisons and the NHL Montreal Canadiens on November 21, 1955; the game ended in a 5–5 tie and sold out five days beforehand. When 60-year-old Duquesne Gardens in Pittsburgh was scheduled for demolition in 1956, it left the Pittsburgh Hornets without an arena and forced them to go idle, freeing up room in the AHL for a Rochester team.

Prior to the AHL franchise, the Arpeako Packers played before thousands at the new Rochester War Memorial. Center Sam Toth and Left Wing Ed House started the original group tasked to bring professional hockey to Rochester. The Central Hockey League was sold on Rochester as its next expansion city. The CHL told Toth and House the CHL was a league that promised more fans than the AHL due to the rougher, more violent product on the ice. Toth and House held out for the AHL and ended up losing out to the group backed by Canadians.

The AHL granted a group which included Rochesterians (and Amerks Hall of Fame members) Sam Toth and Ed House a conditional franchise for Rochester that June. The terms required that the group raise $150,000 of capital, two thirds of which was to be raised by the sale of stock in less than two weeks. When their effort to secure the funds failed to reach its goal, a new group, backed by Selke of the Canadiens and Conn Smythe of the Toronto Maple Leafs, was awarded the franchise. The Leafs and Canadiens each owned 27.5% of the team, with the balance sold to Rochester interests. The team was named the &quot;Americans&quot;.

===Early years (1956–1967)===

Upon entering the league for the 1956–57 season the Americans became a joint affiliate of both the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League, though the club was operated by the Canadiens. Under coach Billy Reay, the team finished in third place in the AHL standings and played the defending champion Providence Reds in the opening round of the Calder Cup playoffs. With Bobby Perreault in goal, the Americans defeated Providence and goaltender Johnny Bower in five games. Rochester then was defeated in a five-game final by the Cleveland Barons, who won the Calder Cup.

The Americans reached the playoffs in 1959, losing to the Buffalo Bisons in five games. The 1959 Americans were led by the &quot;WHAM&quot; line of center Rudy Migay, left wing Gary Aldcorn and right wing Billy Hicke. Migay and Hicke were named co-MVP for the AHL that season, and Hicke was chosen as the league&#x27;s rookie of the year.

In the summer of 1959, the Maple Leafs bought out the Canadiens ownership share of the club, giving them a 55% controlling interest, due to concerns that with Montreal operating the club they were giving their prospects priority over those of the Leafs. They purchased most of the remaining 45% in 1963, boosting their ownership share to 98% by November 1964.

In 1959–60, the Americans became the first team in American Hockey League history to win a playoff series after trailing three-games-to-none. The Amerks&#x27; comeback against the Cleveland Barons included the efforts of the veteran Migay, right wing Pat Hannigan and league-leading goaltender Ed Chadwick. A crowd of 7,762 at the War Memorial witnessed a 4–1 triumph in Game 7. Rochester went on to lose the Calder Cup finals in five games to Eddie Shore&#x27;s Springfield Indians.

Following the 1960–61 season, in which the Americans failed to qualify for the playoffs, the Montreal Canadiens transferred their working agreement to the Quebec Aces of the American Hockey League and sent Rochester players Guy Rousseau and Claude Labrosse to Quebec. As the exclusive affiliate of the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Americans made the playoffs the next two seasons but never contended for the Calder Cup championship.

Beginning in 1963–64, former Americans defenseman Joe Crozier became the team&#x27;s coach and general manager. Under Crozier, the Americans won the Calder Cup in 1965, 1966 and 1968 and were finalists in 1967; they are the only team in AHL history to appear in the Calder Cup finals in four consecutive seasons.

In 1965–66, the Americans played their final 10 regular season and all playoff home games at neutral sites because the 1966 American Bowling Congress tournament occupied the War Memorial. The home games were at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens, about from Rochester, except for of one playoff game at Buffalo&#x27;s Memorial Auditorium in the Calder Cup finals. On May 8, 1966, before a crowd of 7,655 at the &quot;Aud&quot; the Americans tied up the series at two games apiece with a 3–1 victory over the Cleveland Barons. Rochester went on to win the next two games and their second consecutive Calder Cup.

Notable players from this era included Bronco Horvath, Gerry Cheevers, Bobby Perreault, Al Arbour, Darryl Sly, Norm &quot;Red&quot; Armstrong, Duane Rupp, Wally Boyer, Dick Gamble, Stan Smrke, Jim Pappin, Don Cherry, Gerry Ehman, Larry Hillman, and Mike Walton. Alex Faulkner, the first person from Newfoundland and Labrador to play in the NHL, also played on the Amerks.

===The expansion era (1967–1970s)===
When the National Hockey League expanded from six to twelve teams for the 1967–68 NHL season the Americans lost several players. Arbour (St. Louis), and Boyer (Oakland), were drafted by the new NHL teams. Ehman was traded to Oakland and Horvath was loaned to Minnesota. Rupp and Walton were both promoted to the Maple Leafs while Smrke retired.

The Americans struggled through the early part of the 1967–68 AHL season. Just before Christmas, and with the team in last place with a record of 12-15-3, Crozier made a deal with the expansion Minnesota North Stars. In exchange for forwards J. P. Parise and Milan Marcetta the Americans received Ted Taylor, Len Lunde, George &quot;Duke&quot; Harris, Murray Hall, Don Johns, Carl Wetzel and the rights to Horvath. The return of Horvath marked his fourth tour of duty with the Amerks since 1956–57. The Americans improved to go 26-10-6 for the balance of the season en route to finish with the best record in the league. The regular-season champion Amerks then defeated the Hershey Bears four games to one in the playoff semi-finals and the Quebec Aces four games to two in the Calder Cup finals. The Amerks won the final game 4–2 before a crowd of 11,711 at the Colisée de Québec.

In July 1966, Maple Leaf Gardens Limited sold the team to a group which included their then general manager Punch Imlach for a reported $400,000. Two years later, the team was sold to the Vancouver Canucks of the Western Hockey League (WHL) minor league for a reported $950,000. Imlach was a part owner of the Canucks at the time. With the majority of the Rochester players transferred to Vancouver, Canucks won the 1968–69 and 1969–70 WHL Lester Patrick Cup championships, while the Amerks finished in last place each year. When Vancouver became the expansion Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League, they utilized the Amerks as their farm team.

After Rochester finished at the bottom of the AHL standings for four straight years and with local fan support dwindling, the Vancouver NHL team was prepared to either sell or fold the Rochester club. But the Americans were saved in the summer of 1972 when a group of eight Rochester businessmen, most notably Sam Toth, Richard Altier of Altier&#x27;s Shoes, and Joe Fox, head of Rochester-based athletic-wear maker Champion Products, bought the Americans franchise from Vancouver and named Amerks defenseman Don Cherry as coach and general manager. Playing the next two seasons independent of any NHL affiliations, the Amerks qualified for the playoffs in 1972–73, losing to the Boston Braves in the first round. The next season, 1973–74, the Amerks went on to become regular season champions, but lost in the first round to New Haven.

The Boston Bruins hired Cherry as their coach in 1974–75 and became the Americans&#x27; parent team the same year. During the five seasons with the Bruins, the Amerks made the playoffs the first four years, losing in the Calder Cup finals in 1977 to Nova Scotia.

Prior to the 1979–80 season, the Americans were purchased by the Knox family, owners of the Buffalo Sabres (NHL) and became the Sabres&#x27; AHL affiliate. After the Knox brothers died in the 1990s, the Americans and Sabres were split up, with the Sabres going to John Rigas and the Americans being sold to Steve Donner. Despite the sale, the original Buffalo-Rochester partnership became the longest such NHL-AHL affiliation, lasting until the 2007–08 season, and revived for 2011–12. The proximity of the cities of Buffalo and Rochester is a significant advantage in that the Sabres are able to call up and send down players between the two teams with ease, as the two cities are only an hour&#x27;s drive away from each other; Buffalo is the closest NHL city to Rochester, while Rochester is the closest AHL city to Buffalo. (The Hamilton Bulldogs, which existed as an AHL franchise from 1996 to 2015, were closer geographically to Buffalo than Rochester is, but played on the other side of the U.S.-Canada border)

During the original Sabres affiliation, the Americans won three Calder Cup championships and finished as runners-up another six times. They finished out of the playoffs only five times in 28 years.

===1980s–1990s===
The Americans won the first of their &quot;Sabres era&quot; Calder Cups in 1983 under young coach Mike Keenan, sweeping Maine, 4–0.

In the 1986–87 season, the John Van Boxmeer-coached team won the division championship on the last game of the season against the Binghamton Whalers. The Americans were one point behind the Whalers and playing in Binghamton. After goalie Darcy Wakaluk paced the team to a tie in regulation and overtime, the game proceeded to the new &quot;shoot-out&quot; format used that season. As the shoot-out began, Van Boxmeer made one of the most memorable coaching moves in Americans history and pulled Wakaluk from the game, inserting usual starting goalie Darren Puppa who had sat out the game due to injury. Puppa stopped every shot and low-scoring defenseman Jack Brownschidle scored the winning goal. While the teams both finished with identical records (47-26-7), Rochester won the division based on having a better record in head-to-head competition.

The first round of playoffs saw the Americans play the rival Hershey Bears. However, the first two games were moved to the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium due to the Rochester War Memorial being previously booked for the Shrine Circus.

The second event of that memorable season occurred during pregame warmups of the second game. With no officials on the ice (a common occurrence at that time which was changed as a result of this game) a brawl broke out. Players from both teams received suspensions and tough-guy Andy Ristau received a concussion. The Americans won the game in overtime on a goal by defenseman Jim Hofford, who was a late addition to the lineup as a result of the brawl. The Americans went on to win the series, 4–1.

The Americans took on the Sherbrooke Canadiens in the finals and after five games found themselves down three games to two. Behind the leadership of NHL veteran Don Lever, the Amerks came from behind to win Game 6, 7–4, and won the championship in Sherbrooke.

After losing many players from that team to the NHL the following season, the Amerks struggled but returned to the finals in 1990 and 1991, losing both times to the Springfield Indians. They again lost in the finals to the Cape Breton Oilers in 1993.

After a very slow start in the 1995–96 season, the Americans came together midway through the season behind the dramatically improved goaltending of Steve Shields. The team breezed through the first three rounds of the playoffs before finally winning a hard-fought battle against the Portland Pirates to win their sixth, and most recent, Calder Cup.

===2000s===

In 2000, with the promotion of then-coach Brian McCutcheon to assistant coach with the Sabres, former Amerks player Randy Cunneyworth was named coach of the Amerks.

On November 12, 2003, the Sabres and the New Jersey Devils played in the first-ever NHL regular-season game in Rochester.

In the 2003–04 season, the Americans were beaten in five games by the eventual Calder Cup champion Milwaukee Admirals in the Western Conference Finals.

The Americans began a dual-affiliation in 2005 after signing an agreement with the Florida Panthers. Under this agreement the Panthers and Sabres both supplied the Americans with players while the Sabres still employed the coaching staff.

In 2007, the Sabres announced that season would be their last season of affiliation with the Americans. Reasons cited include the financial insecurity of the AHL team, issues between ownership, the City of Rochester, and Blue Cross Arena management, along with the awkwardness of the dual affiliation with the Panthers.

In 2008, the 29-year affiliation officially ended when Buffalo chose the Portland Pirates to be their new AHL affiliate. This separation lasted until 2011 when Terrence Pegula bought the Sabres and then later the Amerks, reuniting them shortly after the 2010–11 season concluded.

On May 6, 2008, the American Hockey League approved the sale of the Americans to Canadian businessman Curt Styres and his investment group, Arrow Express Sports. The sale also included the Rochester Knighthawks of the National Lacrosse League.

On May 13, 2009, Lewis Staats, president of the Americans, formally announced that Jody Gage would not return after 13 seasons as the team&#x27;s general manager. Gage currently serves as the team&#x27;s director of strategic planning.

===2010s===
The Americans notched their 2,000th win on February 21, 2010, in a shootout against the Portland Pirates. Derek Whitmore, from the Rochester suburb of Greece was the last shooter for Portland but goaltender Alexander Salak made the save.

Head coach Benoit Groulx left the organization on May 31 after a reported conflict with vice-president of hockey operations, Ted Nolan.

On May 17, 2011, it was revealed that Terry Pegula had signed a nonbinding letter of intent to purchase the Americans. Pegula, who had recently purchased the Buffalo Sabres desired to re-affiliate the two clubs. The potential purchase had to clear several financial and legal obstacles; first, Pegula had to seek the permission of the Sabres&#x27; then current farm team, the Portland Pirates, since the Pirates had an agreement with the Sabres that lasted through 2014 and had no out clause. Second, the Americans&#x27; corporate sister club, the Rochester Knighthawks lacrosse team, was split off and retained by Styres as Pegula owned the rival Buffalo Bandits. After these arrangements were made, the agreement was reached June 24, 2011, with the official announcement following the same day. Pegula purchased the Americans for US$5 million.
For the 2013–14 season, the Americans participated in that year&#x27;s edition of the AHL Outdoor Classic played at Frontier Field against the Lake Erie Monsters immediately before leaving to take part in the 2013 Spengler Cup, the first time in 17 years that an AHL team participated (the Americans were also the participants in the 1996 Spengler Cup).

On July 28, 2015, Randy Cunneyworth was re-hired as the Americans&#x27; head coach, returning after being the head coach for the Americans from 2000 to 2008. Cunneyworth was relieved of his duties the following season on May 16, 2016 and reassigned to a position in the Sabres&#x27; department of player development. Dan Lambert was named the new head coach. Lambert was fired at the end of the 2016–17 season after a clearing out of the coaching staff and management in Buffalo.

For the 2017 season, it was decided by new Sabres general manager Jason Botterill, that the Americans would have their own general manager and be modeled after how Botterill&#x27;s previous team, the Pittsburgh Penguins, operated the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. In June 2017, the Sabres&#x27; new assistant general manager Randy Sexton was also made the Americans&#x27; general manager and former Americans&#x27; player Chris Taylor was named head coach. 

===2020s===
Sexton was fired on June 16, 2020, along with Botterill. Taylor and the coaching staff were later also fired. Seth Appert was later hired as coach with Jason Karmanos as general manager as part of his Sabres assistant general manager duties.

During the 2021–22 season, the Americans finished 5th in the North division, which was also the final playoff spot in the North division, clinching the position on the final day of the regular season. During the first round of playoffs, the Americans faced off against the Belleville Senators in a best of three playoff series. The Americans would win two of the three games, both in overtime, with both scores resulting in a 4–3 win for the Americans. With the series win, it was the first postseason series win in 17 years, with the last before that coming in the 2005 Calder Cup playoffs. In the following round, they would upset the North division and regular-season Eastern Conference champion Utica Comets in five games. They would face the Laval Rocket in the North Division finals, but would lose in three games, including a triple-overtime loss in the final game of the series.

The Americans once again qualified for the playoffs following the 2022–23 season, and finished third in the North division. In the division semifinals, they faced off against rival Syracuse. They initially went down 2–0 in the series, but were able to win three games in a row to advance to the division finals. The Americans faced off against the division-winning Toronto Marlies in the division finals, sweeping them, and advanced to their first conference finals appearance since the 2004 Calder Cup playoffs.

<text>Career and technical student organizations (CTSOs) are vocational organizations primarily based in high schools, colleges and career technology centers.

Often, on the state level, they are integrated into departments of education or incorporated as nonprofit organizations. Many states define CTSOs as &quot;integral parts&quot; of the high school and college education programs. Other higher education institutions have added extracurricular activities that are not sports-related, like CTSOs in order to enhance the college experience.

Some major CTSOs include:

* BPA (Business Professionals of America, formerly Office Education Association)
* DECA (formerly Distributive Education Clubs of America)
* FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America)
* FCCLA (Family, Career, and Community Leaders of America) (formerly Future Homemakers of America)
* FFA (formerly Future Farmers of America)
* HOSA-Future Health Professionals (formerly Health Occupations Students of America) 
* SkillsUSA (formerly Vocational Industrial Clubs of America)
* TSA (Technology Student Association, formerly American Industrial Arts Student Association)

Other CTSOs recognized by some states include Educators Rising (formerly Future Teachers of America) and the International Thespian Society.

<text>Gotthard Günther (15 June 1900 – 29 November 1984) was a German (Prussian) philosopher.

== Biography ==
Günther was born in Arnsdorf, Hirschberg im Riesengebirge, Prussian Silesia (modern day Jelenia Góra, Poland). From 1921 to 1933, Günther studied sinology and philosophy at the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin, and wrote his doctor&#x27;s thesis on Hegel in 1933 under the guidance of Eduard Spranger. From 1935 to 1937, he worked at the institute of Arnold Gehlen at the University of Leipzig, publishing &quot;Christliche Metaphysik und das Schicksal des modernen Bewusstseins&quot; (Christian metaphysics and the fate of modern consciousness, together with Helmut Schelsky in 1937). He was a member of the Leipzig School.

In the same year, following his wife, the Jewish psychologist Dr. Marie Günther-Hendel, he emigrated from Germany first to Italy, afterwards to Stellenbosch University in South Africa and, in 1940, to the United States. There he completed his system of place-valued logics and morphogrammatics. His great study &quot;Die philosophische Idee einer nicht-Aristotelischen Logik&quot; (“The philosophical concept of a non-Aristotelian logic”) went to print in 1957 (Hamburg, Meiner). As a research professor, he joined the department of electrical engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1960, working together with Warren Sturgis McCulloch, Heinz von Foerster, Humberto Maturana and others. In 1962, he published &quot;Cybernetic ontology and transjunctional operations&quot;. Later he lectured at the University of Hamburg until he died in that city, in 1984 at the age of 84.

According to Isaac Asimov, who considered Gunther &quot;a good friend,&quot; Gunther &quot;felt that civilization was a product of the Old World and could not flourish indigenously in the New.&quot; Asimov noted that Gunther thus &quot;maintained [that] when Old World civilization was transplanted to the New World, a distortion was introduced and one of the ways in which this distortion was evidenced was by the peculiar American invention of science fiction, which was not to be confused with earlier European ventures in the field (i.e., Jules Vernes).&quot;

==Work and legacy==
Günther&#x27;s work was based upon Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Martin Heidegger and Oswald Spengler. He developed a trans-Aristotelian logical approach (omitting the &quot;tertium non datur&quot;). Günther&#x27;s transclassical logic was the attempt to combine improved results of modern dialectic with formal logic. His focus on the philosophical problem of the &quot;Du&quot; (&quot;You&quot;/&quot;Thou&quot;) was trailblazing. He also contributed to the fields of cybernetics and to both natural and social sciences, especially to sociology.

His œuvre (body of work), in German and English, is quite substantial. An overview can be gathered from his three volumes, helping make dialectics operationable (see below). He was of influence in the areas of philosophy, cybernetics, mathematics, and sociology. As of 2004, the Gotthard Günther Research Center (“Gotthard-Günther-Forschungsstelle”) is working at the University of Klagenfurt in Austria.

<text>Kanzi (born October 28, 1980), also known by the lexigram (from the character ), is a male bonobo who has been the subject of several studies on great ape language. According to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, a primatologist who has studied the bonobo throughout her life, Kanzi has exhibited advanced linguistic aptitude.

== Biography ==
Kanzi was born to Lorel and Bosandjo at Yerkes Field Station at Emory University in 1980. Shortly after birth, Kanzi was stolen and adopted by a more dominant female, Matata, the matriarch of the group. 

In 1985, Kanzi was moved to the Language Research Center at Georgia State University. He was later relocated, along with his sister, Panbanisha, to the Great Ape Trust, in Des Moines, Iowa. The ill-fated facility, founded in 2004 by local businessman, Ted Townsend, closed after losing funding, experiencing allegations of neglect, and a flood. 

In 2013, the Ape Cognition and Conservation Initiative (ACCI), under the direction of Jared Taglialatela, a professor at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, and Bill Hopkins, a professor at Georgia State University, took over the facility.

When the ACCI took over Kanzi&#x27;s care in 2013, he was severely obese due to mismanagement of his diet and activity. His new caretakers changed Kanzi&#x27;s diet to a more species-appropriate one and increased his opportunities for physical activity. Kanzi has since lost over seventy-five pounds.

As an infant, Kanzi accompanied Matata to sessions where Matata was taught language through keyboard lexigrams, but showed little interest in the lessons. It was a great surprise to researchers then when one day, while Matata was away, Kanzi began competently using the lexigrams, becoming not only the first observed ape to have learned aspects of language naturalistically rather than through direct training, but also the first observed bonobo to appear to use some elements of language at all. Within a short time, Kanzi had mastered the ten words that researchers had been struggling to teach his adoptive mother, and he has since learned more than 348, which he can also combine for new meaning. When he hears a spoken word (through headphones, to filter out nonverbal clues), he points to the correct lexigram. He can initiate communication using the lexigrams. Sue Savage Rumbaugh, in 2006, claimed Kanzi understands about 3,000 spoken words.

According to a &quot;Discover&quot; article, Kanzi is an accomplished tool user.

Kanzi&#x27;s adoptive mother, Matata, was believed to be in her mid- to late- 40s when she died in June 2014. In the matriarchal society of bonobos, a male&#x27;s position is primarily determined by the position of the females he is related to. Matata was the group&#x27;s chief leader so his status as the highest ranking male was established by being adopted as her &quot;son&quot;. According to Smithsonian Magazine, Kanzi &quot;has the mien of an aging patriarch – he&#x27;s balding and paunchy with serious, deep-set eyes.&quot; This description is confirmed by a full-page color photograph of Kanzi in the March 2008 &quot;National Geographic&quot;, and a full-page black-and-white photograph in &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

== Examples of behavior and abilities ==

Kanzi&#x27;s behavior and abilities have been the topic of research published in scientific journals, as well as reports in popular media.

===Research programs===

When he was eight years old, Kanzi was a subject of a research program in which his ability to respond to spoken requests was compared with that of a two-year-old human child called Alia. The study took nine months to complete. Kanzi and Alia were given 660 spoken instructions, asking them to deal with familiar objects in novel ways. Kanzi responded correctly to 74 percent of the instructions, Alia to 65 percent.

Another study, designed and carried out by archaeologists Kathy Schick and Nicholas Toth, aimed to compare Kanzi&#x27;s cognitive and mechanical abilities with those of early human ancestors who made and used Early Stone Age tools (probably &quot;Homo habilis&quot;), such as Oldowan stone flakes and cores (a core is the rock from which a flake has been removed). In this study, Schick and Toth showed Kanzi how to flake stone, producing a sharp edge that could be used to cut through a rope in order to gain access to a food reward. After modeling the flaking behavior on a variety of occasions, the researchers set up each experiment by placing a food reward inside a box with a transparent lid which was held closed by a length of rope. Kanzi would then be led into an enclosure where the box was located and provided with the stones needed for flaking (known as chert or flint). Over the course of this multi-year study, Kanzi not only learned how to flake, he also developed his own method by throwing the cobbles onto hard surfaces to make a flake, as opposed to the hand-held percussion method that was modeled for him. With the many sharp flakes he produced, Kanzi was able to cut through the rope to gain access to the food reward. However, the flakes he produced and used were more crude than those produced by Early Stone Age humans.

A similar study on the flaking abilities of chimpanzees failed to recreate the findings with Kanzi. The authors suggest that the discrepancies in findings are due to the differences in rearing backgrounds of the subjects. Whilst Kanzi spent a significant portion of his life around humans and being trained by them (leading to a high level of enculturation), the chimpanzees in the recent study were not trained or demonstrated how to make or use flakes (or in any other human behaviours). This may explain why Kanzi was able to develop flaking after observing humans, and the chimpanzees in the recent study were not.

In a study by Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Social and Cognitive Origins researchers published in February 2025 in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;, the research group &quot;worked with three male bonobos, Nyota, 25; Kanzi, 43; and Teco, 13, all living at Ape Initiative, a research and education nonprofit.&quot;

If the researcher interacting with the bonobo [Kanzi or one of the other two] asked &quot;Where&#x27;s the grape?&quot; but had clearly seen the treat being hidden, the bonobo &quot;would usually sit still and wait for the treat&quot; during the 10-second wait after the question; &quot;but when [the researcher] hadn&#x27;t seen where the treat was hidden, the ape would quickly point to the right cup—sometimes quite demonstratively.&quot;

It&#x27;s &quot;the first [such work] to replicate in a controlled setting similar findings from the wild&quot;; Johns Hopkins assistant professor Chris Krupenye noted &quot;The results also suggest apes can simultaneously hold two conflicting world views in their mind. They know exactly where the food is, and at the same time, they know that their partner&#x27;s view of the same situation is missing that information&quot; and that &quot;this so-called theory of mind supports many of the capacities&quot; behind advanced human capabilities and social organization and &quot;demonstrates the rich mental foundations that humans and other apes share.&quot; 

===Anecdotes===

Kanzi is recognized for his ability to &quot;evoke absent objects, invent new formulas to describe elements whose names he did not know...he had a certain notion of time and seemed to understand another&#x27;s point of view.&quot; The following are anecdotes, rather than experimental demonstrations.

* In an outing in the woods in Georgia, Kanzi touched the symbols for &quot;marshmallows&quot; and &quot;fire&quot;. Susan Savage-Rumbaugh said in an interview that, &quot;Given matches and marshmallows, Kanzi snapped twigs for a fire, lit them with the matches and toasted the marshmallows on a stick.&quot; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; has published photographs of Kanzi putting together a fire for food.
* Paul Raffaele, at Savage-Rumbaugh&#x27;s request, performed a haka for the bonobos. This Māori war dance includes thigh-slapping, chest-thumping, and shouting. Almost all the bonobos present interpreted this as an aggressive display, and reacted with loud screams, tooth-baring, and pounding the walls and the floor. Kanzi, who remained calm, communicated with Savage-Rumbaugh using bonobo vocalizations; Savage-Rumbaugh interpreted these vocalizations, and said to Raffaele, &quot;he&#x27;d like you to do it again just for him, in a room out back, so the others won&#x27;t get upset.&quot; Later, a private performance in another room was carried out.
* Savage-Rumbaugh has observed Kanzi in communication to his sister. In this experiment, Kanzi was kept in a separate room of the Great Ape Project and shown some yogurt. Kanzi made some vocalizations that his sister could hear; his sister, Panbanisha, who could not see the yogurt, then pointed to the lexigram for yogurt, suggesting those vocalizations may have meaning.
* In one demonstration on the television show &quot;Champions of the Wild&quot;, Kanzi was shown playing the arcade game &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and understanding how to beat it.
* On July 22, 2023, a video uploaded to YouTube by the user ChrisDaCow showed Kanzi playing a modified version of &quot;Minecraft&quot;. The video earned over 3 million views in 10 days and raised nearly $10,000 for The Ape Initiative as of August 2, 2023. On January 12, 2024, a sequel was published which featured him and another bonobo, his nephew Teco, defeating the game&#x27;s final boss.

== Language ==
Kanzi learned to communicate using a keyboard with lexigrams. Kanzi also picked up signs from American Sign Language from watching videos of Koko the gorilla, who communicated using signs to her keeper Penny Patterson; Savage-Rumbaugh did not realize Kanzi could sign until he signed, &quot;You, Gorilla, Question&quot;, to anthropologist Dawn Prince-Hughes, who had previously worked closely with gorillas. Based on trials performed at Yerkes Primate Research Center, Kanzi was able to identify symbols correctly 89–95% of the time.
Kanzi cannot vocalize in a manner that is comprehensible to most humans, as bonobos have different vocal tracts than humans, which makes them incapable of reproducing most of the vocal sounds humans can make. Nonetheless, it was noticed that every time Kanzi communicated with humans with specially-designed graphic symbols, he also produced some vocalization. Later, it was discovered that Kanzi was producing the articulatory equivalent of the symbols he was indicating, although in a very high pitch and with distortions.

According to the research of Dr. Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, Kanzi &quot;can understand individual spoken words and how they are used in novel sentences&quot;. For example, the researcher asked Kanzi to go get the carrot in the microwave, Kanzi went directly to the microwave and completely ignored the carrot that was closer to him, but not in the microwave. In another example, a researcher gave the task, &quot;feed your ball some tomato&quot;. Alia, a human 2-year-old, did not know what to do, but Kanzi immediately used a spongy toy Halloween pumpkin as a ball and began to feed the toy.

=== Limitations ===
Although Kanzi is considered to be the best case for apes acquiring language-like capabilities, his utterances were not equivalent to that of a 3-year-old child. Kanzi’s utterances still rely heavily on human interpretation, a common criticism of great ape language experiments. For example, when Kanzi used &quot;strawberry&quot; it would be interpreted as a request to go to where the strawberries grow, a request to eat some, used as a name, and so on dependent on the handler’s interpretation and context.

Kanzi also showed no ability in the use of function words, nor could he make use of morphology, such as indicating the plural form of a noun, or syntax. As with other great ape language experiments, Kanzi is not considered by linguists to display a capacity for language.

<doc id="566068" wikidata="Q380186" url="?curid=566068" title="Presto (album)">
<text>Presto is the thirteenth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush. It was released on November 17, 1989 by Anthem Records and was the band&#x27;s first album released internationally by Atlantic Records, following the group&#x27;s departure from Mercury. After the &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; (1987) tour ended in 1988, the group members reconvened in December to decide their next step and agreed to take six months off before starting on a new album. &quot;Presto&quot; marked another change in Rush&#x27;s sound, with guitar taking a more dominant role in the writing, a reduction in synthesizers and a return towards more guitar-driven arrangements.

&quot;Presto&quot; reached No. 7 in Canada and No. 16 in the United States. &quot;Show Don&#x27;t Tell,&quot; &quot;The Pass&quot; and &quot;Superconductor&quot; were released as singles from &quot;Presto&quot;; the former charted at No. 1 on the U.S. Album Rock Tracks chart. Rush supported the album with the Presto Tour from February to June 1990. &quot;Presto&quot; reached gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling 500,000 copies. The album was remastered in 2004 and 2013, the latter as part of the 2013 box set &quot;The Studio Albums 1989–2007&quot;. In 2015, it was reissued after being remastered by Sean Magee at Abbey Road Studios, following a direct approach by Rush to remaster their entire back catalogue.

==Background==
In May 1988, Rush wrapped up touring the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; (1987), which was followed by the band&#x27;s third live release, &quot;A Show of Hands&quot;, in early 1989. The group then decided not to renew contracts with international distributor Mercury Records; Lifeson said they departed because the relationship had become stale by this point. Peart later wrote that with the band now &quot;free of deadlines and obligations&quot; for the first time in 15 years, they chose to take advantage by taking a six-month break. In December 1988, the group gathered at Peart&#x27;s house to discuss the next step and agreed to start a new studio album after the break.

==Writing==
Work on &quot;Presto&quot; began with Rush renting a studio in the country to write and rehearse new material. They adopted their usual method of Lifeson and Lee working on music while Peart worked alone on lyrics. Peart wrote: &quot;At the end of the day I might wander into the studio, ice cubes clinking, and listen to what they&#x27;d been up to, and if I&#x27;d been lucky, show them something new.&quot; Rush worked at the studio during the week and returned home on weekends.

&quot;Presto&quot; marks the beginning of Rush&#x27;s return to a more guitar-driven sound from what&#x27;s known to many as the band&#x27;s &quot;synthesizer period&quot; of the previous four releases. When Lifeson and Lee discussed what musical direction to take, they agreed that the core of the band&#x27;s sound, emotion, and energy had come from the guitar, something that they wanted to return to for &quot;Presto&quot;. This resulted in a much more satisfying album for Lifeson. Lifeson had felt constricted in his guitar playing since synthesizers began playing a more dominant role in the songwriting and performance on &quot;Signals&quot; (1982), which had continued through the 1980s. Lee explained that Rush wanted &quot;Presto&quot; to be &quot;more of a singer&#x27;s album, and I think you&#x27;ll notice that the arrangements musically support the vocal. [...] Neil&#x27;s lyrics to me are a lot more heartfelt. [...] This album was a real reaction against technology in a sense. I was getting sick and tired of working with computers and synthesizers. [...] We made a pact to stay away from strings, pianos, and organs—to stay away from digital technology. In the end, we couldn&#x27;t resist using them for colour.&quot;

In a contrast to previous albums &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; (1984), &quot;Power Windows&quot; (1985) and &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;, the album does not contain an overall running lyrical theme, or what Peart described as &quot;heavy&quot; lyrical messages, instead adopting a more loose approach with each track making its own statement. Peart used the word &quot;response&quot; to describe the lyrical content as a whole. &quot;The idea that you don&#x27;t go through life just looking at things. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;ve been all around the world - you may have seen it, but if you haven&#x27;t felt it, you haven&#x27;t been there.&quot; Peart added: &quot;There are many threads and a strong motif of looking at life today and trying to act inside it.&quot;

The album&#x27;s title was an idea that Rush had considered using for &quot;A Show of Hands&quot;, but when Peart started writing a song entitled &quot;Presto&quot;, it was then used as the title of the album.

==Recording==
After several songs had been worked out, the band felt it was the right time to present what they had to a co-producer. However, their initial choice, Peter Collins, who&#x27;d worked on &quot;Power Windows&quot; and &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;, reluctantly declined the offer to work on &quot;Presto&quot;, as he wished to produce other bands. Though Rush felt confident enough to undertake production duties themselves, they still wanted someone they could trust and to provide an objective point of view to their ideas. Among the various candidates was English producer, songwriter, and keyboardist Rupert Hine, whose experience with a variety of artists attracted the group. Peart recalled the time when they presented their ideas to Hine: &quot;We were a little bemused [...] at the end of some of them he actually seemed to be laughing! We looked at each other, eyebrows raised as if to say: &#x27;He thinks our songs are funny?&#x27; But evidently it was a laugh of pleasure; he stayed &#x27;til the end&quot;. At Hine&#x27;s suggestion, the group brought in Stephen W. Tayler as the recording and mixing engineer. The sessions with Rush and Hine together were productive; initially, 10 days were assigned for pre-production work with one track for each day, but it was complete after just one-and-a-half days.

&quot;Presto&quot; was recorded from June to August 1989. As part of their deal with Hine, the band agreed to record parts of the album in London. &quot;Presto&quot; was finished around four weeks ahead of schedule.

When the album was complete, Rush sought a new record deal and signed to Atlantic Records after executive Doug Morris, who had wanted to sign the group for a number of years, made an attractive offer.

==Songs==
===Side one===
&quot;The Pass&quot; concerns a friend of Peart&#x27;s who joined him on a cycle ride and once discussed juvenile suicide, which inspired the lyrics for the song. Peart named it the song he had worked the hardest on, due to the delicate nature of the subject. The song became a group favorite; Peart cited the track as the reason they would re-record the &quot;Presto&quot; album, if they could.

&quot;Scars&quot; features a complex drum pattern in which both acoustic and electronic drums are utilized. The pattern was derived from a tribal rhythm Peart heard while on a bicycle tour of Africa (later chronicled in his first book, &quot;The Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa&quot;). He went on to incorporate this pattern into his live drum solos. The song also features the use of a sequencer in place of, and often mistaken for, a bass guitar.

Lifeson said the title track is about &quot;feeling more active in your heart than in your head, not having the answers to problems.&quot;

===Side two===
&quot;Superconductor&quot; deals with the superficiality of mainstream music. That topic also appears in other songs such as &quot;Grand Designs&quot; from the &quot;Power Windows&quot; album. 

In &quot;Anagram (for Mongo)&quot;, every line contains one or more words that are formed by using letters in another word from that same line (e.g. &quot;There is no safe seat at the feast&quot;), and certain lines contain anagrammed words (e.g. &quot;Miracles will have their claimers&quot;). Its title was inspired by the character Mongo from the 1974 film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;. Lifeson spoke about the lyrics: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t mean anything, it was just a fun thing, but there are some great twists in there.&quot;

&quot;Hand Over Fist&quot; was originally an instrumental that Rush had intended to include on &quot;Presto&quot;, but Peart continued to submit lyrical ideas to Lifeson and Lee; one in particular fit the music well enough and the plan for an instrumental was scrapped. In the album&#x27;s tour book, Peart used the symbolism that the hand game &quot;rock, paper, scissors&quot; represents, which was made into a nursery rhyme and used as a lyrical chant in &quot;Hand Over Fist.&quot;

==Artwork and promotion==
The album&#x27;s sleeve was designed by Rush&#x27;s longtime collaborator Hugh Syme: a black-and-white design depicting a levitating magician&#x27;s hat on a hill with a rabbit emerging from it. The field in the foreground has many rabbits. Rush had devised its concept and presented it to Syme, who then produced several ideas depicting what they suggested. Lifeson recalled the moment when they saw the design they went with: &quot;We all started laughing hysterically, &#x27;This is great, it&#x27;s perfect!&#x27;&quot;

Rush produced three music videos for Presto: &quot;Show Don&#x27;t Tell&quot;, &quot;The Pass&quot; and &quot;Superconductor&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Gregory Heaney of AllMusic described the album as &quot;workmanlike&quot; and removed from the creativity of their earlier works. However, he asserted that the songs weren&#x27;t terrible, just that something was not quite clicking, perhaps due to the length of time it had been since the band wrote more-traditional, guitar-based songs. However, before Heaney&#x27;s review was posted, the site had listed a favorable 4.5 star (out of a possible 5) review of the album by Mackenzie Wilson, who described the album as one that &quot;intelligently leads Rush into the &#x27;90s without musical bleakness&quot;.

<text>Frederic Shu Kong Hsieh (, March 1, 1945–August 8, 1999) was a Chinese-born American realtor and investor who &quot;founded&quot; the first Chinese American suburban community of Monterey Park, California by purchasing and reselling plots of abandoned land in the city at premium prices to Chinese investors from Taiwan. In addition, he heavily promoted Monterey Park in newspapers of Hong Kong and Taiwan to encourage prospective Chinese emigrants to move to the city. In the early 1970s, he predicted that the then-predominantly Caucasian city of Monterey Park and the San Gabriel Valley would serve as an anchor for new ethnic Chinese immigrants as an alternative to the old Chinatown in Los Angeles, but it was immediately dismissed and brushed off as mere speculation at the time. 

However, his prophetic words came true as many Hong Kong and Taiwanese immigrant elite and poverty-stricken ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam alike began settling in Monterey Park and in nearby Alhambra, Rosemead, and San Gabriel, California. Additionally, many immigrants from Mainland China, who would have settled to traditional immigrant points such as San Francisco or New York City, have also arrived to Monterey Park and other parts of the San Gabriel Valley due to the work of Hsieh. Wealthier immigrants have since moved onto San Marino (an expensive neighborhood) in large numbers during the 1980s and eventually in other communities such as Walnut and Rowland Heights thus giving rise to new suburban Chinatown areas in the Los Angeles. By the 1980s, for the first time in US history, Monterey Park became the first suburban city with an Asian American majority population. Hence, Hsieh is generally credited for leading the way to Chinese immigration in the Greater Los Angeles area. This process initiated a wave of some &quot;white flight&quot; from then white-bread communities.

He owned and operated the prominent Chinese American realty company, Mandarin Realty, which still operates in Monterey Park. As a developer, entrepreneur, he was also a community activist. He left a historic mark on the city of Monterey Park and the entire region.

Hsieh died while visiting Las Vegas in 1999.

<text>The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues was one of the first true missions for the &quot;Paranoia&quot; role-playing game. It was written by John M. Ford and won the H. G. Wells Award for Best Role-Playing Adventure of 1985.

==Plot summary==
&quot;The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues&quot; is a four-part scenario in which the troubleshooters repeatedly try to get hold of a mysterious black box. Their quest pits them against the various secret societies of Alpha Complex (including the Death Leopards and the Sierra Club) and eventually leads them to the Outside and an ancient rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll cult.

&quot;The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues&quot; consists of 4 sub-missions that aren&#x27;t related at all, save for the constant appearance of a mysterious Black Box. Each of the PC Troubleshooters have orders to capture the box for their secret society. Unfortunately, everyone else they meet has the same orders. This leads to a constant, massive brawl for the box, despite no one really knowing what is inside.

==Legacy==
Several concepts in this adventure have become Paranoia staples:
* Everyone (not just the PCs) vying for a single MacGuffin, often leading to...
* Massive firefights with a half-dozen or more groups battling it out (with the PCs caught in the crossfire).
* Situations of pure madness in which the PCs can either flail about helplessly or sit back and try to survive. (In this case, the Dance Routine From Hell.)
* A series of escalating gags at the briefings.
* Seemingly fatal events that the PCs can survive, provided they don&#x27;t do anything (like try to survive).
* Two endings, a semi-serious one and a bring-the-house-down one. (Literally; Alpha Complex doesn&#x27;t survive the latter.)

==Publication history==
&quot;The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues&quot; was written by John M. Ford, with art by Jim Holloway, and was first published by West End Games in 1985 as a 48-page book with an outer folder.

&quot;The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues&quot; was one of the early supplements for &quot;Paranoia&quot;, along with Warren Spector and Allen Varney&#x27;s &quot;Send in the Clones&quot; (1985).

==Reception==
Marcus L. Rowland reviewed &quot;The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #77, giving it an overall rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that &quot;John M Ford, the author of this adventure, should be justifiably proud. It&#x27;s a must for any &quot;Paranoia&quot; referee.&quot;

&quot;The Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues&quot; won the H.G. Wells Award for &quot;Best Role-playing Adventure of 1985&quot;.

<doc id="566081" wikidata="Q2619022" url="?curid=566081" title="John Ernst Worrell Keely">
<text>John Ernst Worrell Keely (September 3, 1837 – November 18, 1898) was an American fraudster and self-proclaimed inventor from Philadelphia who claimed to have discovered a new motive power which was initially described as &quot;vaporic&quot; or &quot;etheric&quot; force, and later as an unnamed force based on &quot;vibratory sympathy&quot;, by which he produced &quot;interatomic ether&quot; from water and air. Keely&#x27;s claims were highly disputed throughout his career and, in the 21st century, are generally considered to be pseudoscientific.

Keely secured substantial investments from many people, including John Jacob Astor IV. Despite numerous requests from the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company, which had been established to produce a practicable motor based on his work, he consistently refused to fully discuss the principles on which his motor supposedly operated and also repeatedly refused demands to produce a marketable product by claiming that he needed to perfect his inventions. He became embroiled in several lawsuits, and after Keely&#x27;s death, evidence of his elaborate fraud was discovered.

==Biography==
Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, John Keely was orphaned in early childhood and was raised by his grandparents. Before becoming an inventor, he worked as a member of a theatrical orchestra, a painter, a carpenter, a carnival barker, and as a mechanic.

==Career==
In 1872, Keely invited scientists to a demonstration at his laboratory at 1422 North Twentieth Street, Philadelphia, of a machine that he asserted was motivated by a new and previously unknown force. Keely announced that he had discovered a principle for power production based on the musical vibrations of tuning forks and that music could resonate with atoms or with the aether. In the 19th century, luminiferous aether was the hypothesized substance that allowed light waves to propagate through the vacuum of outer space. 

Public interest was aroused, and within a few months, the Keely Motor Company was formed in New York, with a capital of $5,000,000, equivalent to $95 million in 2013.

===Keely&#x27;s theories===
Keely delivered descriptions of the supposed principles of his process on various occasions.

In 1884, following the demonstration of his &quot;vaporic gun&quot;:
Following a demonstration in June 1885:
In the 19th century, most physicists believed that all space was filled with a medium called the &quot;luminiferous aether&quot; (or &quot;ether&quot;). This hypothetical substance was thought necessary for the transmission of electromagnetic waves and the propagation of light, which was believed to be impossible in &quot;empty&quot; space.

===Etheric generator===
On November 10, 1874, Keely demonstrated an &quot;etheric generator&quot; to a small group in Philadelphia. Keely blew into a nozzle for half a minute, then poured five gallons of tap water into the same nozzle. After some adjustments, a pressure gauge indicated pressures of 10,000 psi, which Keely said was evidence that the water had been disintegrated and a mysterious vapor had been liberated in the generator, capable of powering machinery. In subsequent demonstrations, he kept changing the terminology he used, from &quot;vibratory-generator&quot; to a &quot;hydro-pneumatic-pulsating-vacu-engine&quot; to &quot;quadruple negative harmonics&quot;. It was later reported that the witnesses of the demonstration were so impressed that they formed a stock company, purchased patent rights for the six New England states, and paid $50,000 in cash for their share in the invention.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in June 1875 that Keely&#x27;s new motive power was generated from cold water and air and evolved into a vapor &quot;more powerful than steam, and considerably more economical&quot;. It reported that Keely refused to disclose what the vapor was or how it was generated until he had taken out patents in &quot;all the countries of the globe which issue patent rights&quot;, estimated to cost around $30,000.

Keely said that the discovery of this new energy source was accidental. He said that the apparatus by which it was generated was called a &quot;generator&quot; or &quot;multiplicator&quot;, from where it was then passed into a &quot;receiver&quot; and from there to the cylinders of a steam engine. The &quot;generator&quot; was reported as being about , made of Austrian gunmetal in one piece and holding about 10 or 12 gallons of water. Its inside consisted of cylindrical chambers connected by pipes and fitted with stopcocks and valves. The &quot;receiver&quot; or &quot;reservoir&quot; was about long by in diameter and connected to the &quot;generator&quot; by a diameter pipe. Keely claimed that his apparatus would generate his &quot;vapor&quot; from water solely by mechanical means without using any chemicals and claimed to be able to produce 2,000 psi in 5 seconds.

===Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore===
In 1881, Keely met Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore, the wealthy widow of a Philadelphia industrialist who had established the Bloomfield Moore art collection the year before. Mrs Moore became acquainted with Keely through her interest in scientific subjects and remained his friend and patron until his death. She invested $100,000 plus a monthly salary of $250 (around $2.2 million and $5400/month in today&#x27;s values ) so that he could focus completely on the perfection of his motor and widely advocated him and his work, producing many articles and books.

Her family disapproved of her assuming obligations, which they believed the company should fulfill under its contract with Keely. She arranged with Keely in 1890 to furnish him with an additional $2000 per month for his household and shop expenses and instruments, which was to expire when he had gained sufficient control of his unknown force to enable him to resume his work under the direction of the management of the company upon a provisional engine. This arrived in December 1890, when Mrs Bloomfield Moore handed over to the Directors bills that had been presented since the expiration of Mr. Keely&#x27;s contract with her.

===Stockholder suit===
On December 14, 1881, the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company held a meeting at which a report was read that complained that while they had faith in the merits of Keely&#x27;s invention, the inventor was unreasonably secretive of the principles and operating methods of his apparatus. He had assured them that the &quot;generator&quot; had been perfected a year before and that the &quot;multiplicator&quot; was also now perfected, and they considered it only fair and reasonable that the secrets of the machinery be revealed to them. They recommended that some intelligent and trustworthy person be taken into Keely&#x27;s confidence &quot;so that in the case of accident they would not be totally without a clue to the invention&quot;. The report complained at some length about Keely&#x27;s uncommunicativeness and said that it was the experience of everyone who had come into contact with him over the previous ten years that &quot;any attempt at a serious investigation of his operations has been met on his part with deception and misrepresentation&quot;.

Keely was reluctant to reveal his secrets and filed a demurrer on January 20, 1882, to the bill in equity presented against him by the Keely Motor Company&#x27;s stockholders. The demurrer was described as entirely technical and gave several reasons why the court should not afford the plaintiffs the relief they sought. Argument was heard on the demurrer in Philadelphia&#x27;s Court of Common Pleas on March 27, when it was argued that the inventor &quot;could not be made to expose that which no one knew but himself and which was hidden in his own brain&quot;. However, Judge Pierce overruled Keely on April 1, 1882, ordering him to &quot;make known his process in the way indicated in the bill filed by the Keely Motor Company&quot;.

On May 24, Keely filed his answer to the stockholders&#x27; equity suit. He admitted the truth of the complainants&#x27; bill regarding the contract. He added that although he had failed to bring his inventions into practical use due to &quot;certain abstruse difficulties because of the nature and qualities of the said force&quot;, he believed he would ultimately succeed.

In June 1882, a committee appointed by the Company&#x27;s board of directors agreed that one William Boekel of Philadelphia was to be &quot;instructed by Mr. Keely in the construction and operation of his inventions&quot;.

The annual meeting of the company&#x27;s stockholders on December 13, 1882, heard a report from Boekel in which he stated that what Keely claimed to have discovered was &quot;the fact that water in its natural state is capable of being, by vibratory motion, disintegrated so that its molecular structure is broken up, and there is evolved therefrom a permanent expansive gas or ether, which result is produced by mechanical action&quot;. Boekel said it would be improper to describe the mechanism used, adding that Keely had discovered all that he had claimed. It was later discovered by a &quot;Times&quot; reporter in August that Boekel had not yet been entrusted with the secrets of the motor as promised by Keely, and that the inventor kept delaying matters by telling Boekel that he could explain it to him in less than two hours after it was completed and that he had not done so already because the engine had not yet reached that state.

On August 28, 1883, at the monthly meeting of the company&#x27;s directors, it was announced that Keely&#x27;s engine would be ready for operation around the first week in September and that a final inspection of it by the Trustees would be conducted on August 29, at which the stockholders were expected to be present. However, when the inspection was made the following day, Keely said that it would not be ready for another six weeks.

On October 29, 1883 it was reported that the company&#x27;s stockholders were to bring another suit against the inventor in the name of the company for &quot;fulfilment of his many pledges&quot;. At a meeting of the Board of Directors the following day, Keely made a statement explaining his progress, saying that he was constructing a street chamber to hold his vapor and that when this was complete a demonstration would be given, and his explanation was voted &quot;very satisfactory&quot; by the directors.

At the annual stockholders&#x27; meeting on December 12, 1883, a letter from Keely was read out, in which the inventor said that he could not see why he might not fulfill the shareholders&#x27; expectations in the next two months and suggested that the stockholders&#x27; meeting be postponed to February 1, 1884. This proposal met with some disagreement from some stockholders, and it was decided to give Keely no funds for the next 60 days. When the promised stockholders&#x27; meeting was held on February 1, 1884, another postponement was announced at Keely&#x27;s request. A board meeting which took place on March 25, 1884 reported that the vibratory engine was finished, that &quot;the work of adjusting and focalizing is progressing rapidly&quot;, and that Keely had set a date for the demonstration of the motor to take place on or before April 10.

===Vaporic gun===
On September 20, 1884, Keely demonstrated a &quot;vaporic gun&quot; at Sandy Hook to a party of Government officials. He said that he had brought with him five gallons of &quot;vaporic force&quot; in a &quot;receiver&quot;, which, if the experiments were successful, would show that no bogus aids had been used. The gun was described as a small gun with a bore, resting on wheels, with an iron &quot;receiver&quot; long containing Keely&#x27;s mysterious force connected to it by &quot;an iron wire tube&quot; 3/16&quot; (5 mm) in diameter. Keely rammed a small lead ball about in weight into the gun&#x27;s muzzle, then tapped the iron &quot;receiver&quot; with a hammer. He explained that this was to stimulate the &quot;vibratory force&quot;. He then turned a handle, and the ball was fired from the gun with a short, sharp report but no smoke and minimal recoil. It was reported that the projectile had been fired at a distance of . More shots were fired and their velocity measured; one attained , another , and yet another . The gun was also tested by firing against three thick spruce planks and penetrated the first and went halfway through the second. Keely said that he had used a pressure of 7,000 psi and could use 30,000 psi.

The following day, Keely met with a reporter, who declared that his experimenting days were over and that complete success was close. He announced that his motor would be completed in less than two months and that he would then make a public exhibition of its powers.

The vaporic gun failed to impress Lieutenant E.L. Zalinski, who had witnessed the demonstration. He told the president of the Keely Motor Company, A.R. Edey, that with the same apparatus, he could perform the same experiments with compressed air and go even further than Keely had gone. Edey said he would &quot;speak about it to Mr. Keely,&quot; but the offer was not accepted. Zalinski said that none of the experiments at Sandy Hook showed that Keely had discovered a new force.

Zalinski later attended a November demonstration at Keely&#x27;s workshop in place of Colonel John Hamilton. He later reported that he suggested to Keely that it would be a complete test of his power if he discharged a large reservoir, which he showed his guests, and then recharged it using his generator. Keely declined to do this because it would take two hours - despite his many statements that he could generate force in a few seconds - and that the reservoir had been &quot;carefully negatized&quot;. Keely also claimed to have achieved pressures of 50,000 psi and had broken all his pressure gauges. When Zalinski produced a pressure gauge he had brought with him - capable of registering 10,000 psi - and offered it to Keely, saying, &quot;I would like to have you put it on, and break it for me&quot;, Keely was momentarily lost for words before saying, &quot;I do not believe in pressure gauges, anyhow.&quot;

===June 1885 demonstration===
On June 6, 1885, Keely gave what he called &quot;an exhibition&quot; of his motor at his workshop at North Twentieth Street, Philadelphia. Around 20 witnesses attended, including newspaper reporters, a mechanical engineer, and officers and stockholders of the Keely Motor Company. A reporter noticed a &quot;large iron globular object&quot;, which he was told was a new engine that Keely was engaged in building.

Keely assembled an apparatus on top of which was screwed a globe with several apertures to which tubes were fixed, leading to cylinders. A reporter asked if he could see the globe&#x27;s contents, but Keely declined, saying that it would take too long and that he wished to show results rather than the mechanism. Keely then rubbed a violin bow across one of two large tuning forks that formed part of his apparatus. After making a minor adjustment to the device, he opened a stopcock leading into one of the cylinders and the witnesses heard &quot;a hiss as of escaping air&quot;. Keely told them that it was, in fact, &quot;etheric vapor&quot;, adding, &quot;It ain&#x27;t compressed air or any vapor having substance.&quot; The force was then used to lift some weights, and Keely claimed that he had about 22,000 psi of pressure at his disposal.

A further demonstration was given of a rotating iron globe suspended on an axle, which was used to saw some wood. The globe was not opened, Keely saying that it was hollow and empty, and his assistants saying it contained &quot;some bits of mechanism&quot;. A skeptical reporter, who believed it was operating on compressed air, asked how long the engine could work. Keely replied that he had one run for 40 days, whereupon the reporter suggested he run it for half an hour, just making the globe rotate. Keely duly set the globe rotating, which ran for less than 15 minutes, constantly decreasing in power, before stopping it.

On March 26, 1886, Keely performed a demonstration before a committee of scientists and engineers from New York, where he obtained a pressure of 2,700 psi apparently by using a single pint of water and then doubled the pressure by adding more water. Keely claimed that the &quot;etheric force&quot; by which these results were obtained would be utilized as fully as possible in the 25,000 hp engine he was working on.

The stockholders of the Keely Motor Company met on December 14, 1887, and expressed their confidence in Keely&#x27;s ultimate success. Keely did not attend the meeting but supplied a report in which he reviewed his efforts and experiments since 1882 and announced that he had abandoned &quot;etheric force&quot; in favor of a new force which was unnamed but which he said was based on &quot;vibratory sympathy&quot;.

===Wilson suit===
On January 3, 1888, an injunction was granted against Keely on behalf of complainant Bennett C. Wilson, who said that in 1863, he had agreed with Keely, whom he had originally engaged to varnish furniture. The agreement was that Wilson was to find tools and materials and pay the expenses of inventions made by Keely; Keely agreed that he and Wilson should equally own all inventions made and patents obtained. On August 14, 1869, Keely assigned half ownership in what was referred to as the &quot;Keely motor&quot; to Wilson, who claimed that Keely had assigned all rights and title to the invention later that same month in return for funds.

Wilson alleged that he had only recently become aware that the &quot;Keely motor&quot; machine was the same as the one constructed in 1869 and assigned to him. He asked for an injunction restraining Keely from removing the machine or altering its construction or mode of operation. He requested that an order also be made compelling Keely to exhibit to the complainant all models, machines, and drawings of the invention referred to in the assignments to Wilson and that an order be made compelling Keely to fully disclose the invention and the mode of constructing and operating it.

On April 7, a formal order was made directing Bennett Wilson, his attorney, and four experts to fully inspect the Keely motor, its mode of construction, and principle of operation within 30 days. The four experts were named Dr. Charles M. Cresson, Analytical Chemist of City and State Boards of Health; Thomas Shaw, mechanical engineer; William D. Marks, civil engineer and Professor of Dynamical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania; and Jacob Naylor, iron founder and President of the Eighth National Bank. The result of the inspection was to make known only whether the present Keely motor was or was not the same apparatus that he was alleged to have assigned to Wilson in 1869.

On September 18, it was revealed that Keely had not obeyed the court order, despite the period having been increased to 60 days, and a lawyer representing Bennett Wilson said he believed Keely never would comply with the order and that he had never intended to do so. Finally, on November 17, 1888, Keely was jailed in Moyamensing Prison for contempt of court for refusing the court order to &quot;operate and explain the mode of operation&quot; of the Keely Motor. However, he was soon released on bail on November 20 by three judges of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

Finally, on January 28, 1889, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania handed down an opinion reversing the order committing Keely to prison for contempt and ordered his discharge. The opinion declared that the order commanding Keely to &quot;exhibit, explain, and operate his motor&quot; was premature and that the court had no right to enforce the order by committing Keely to jail for contempt.

On March 28, 1889, Keely&#x27;s counsel announced that the inventor had the &quot;missing link&quot; to make the &quot;vibratory resonator and ethereal generative evaporator&quot; successful. It was described as a copper tube in the form of a loop, with the ends welded together so that no joint could be seen, and had been made in copper due to that metal&#x27;s &quot;resonant properties&quot;. A private demonstration of Keely&#x27;s motor was promised as soon as the tube was &quot;adjusted&quot;, and was stated as likely to occur &quot;in a week or two&quot;.

At the Keely Motor Company&#x27;s stockholders&#x27; meeting in December, a report was read from Keely in which he discussed the difficulties he had had with the Board of Directors during 1889 and said that while the work of &quot;graduating&quot; or adjusting his provisional engine had not progressed as rapidly as he had expected, no serious obstacles had presented themselves. No difficulties affected the principle or &quot;essence&quot; of his work. While he could not give a timescale for when the graduation of the engine would be completed, Keely said that it would not be a protracted period and that when it was finished, one or more engines would at once be ordered.

In June 1895, the trade journal &quot;Electricity&quot; published a challenge to Keely, saying that it would undertake to repeat every phenomenon produced by Keely within 60 days. Keely ignored this challenge.

After an absence of several years in England, Mrs. Moore returned to the US to deal with litigation concerning her late husband&#x27;s estate. Her advocacy of Keely and his inventions formed part of the case, and she decided to strengthen her position by getting eminent physicists to examine his inventions. Among those invited were Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, who declined the opportunity for various reasons.

Keely again informed the directors of his company in early November 1895 that &quot;before the end of the year&quot;, he would &quot;positively be all through with his work to prove that&quot; he has devised &quot;a practical commercial working engine&quot; operated by his new force.

On November 14, it was reported that another meeting had been arranged between Keely and Mrs. Bloomfield Moore and New York capitalists headed by John Jacob Astor IV, who were interested in the Keely Motor Company. It was reported the following week that Astor had purchased a significant interest in the motor from &quot;a person who for some years past has been an enthusiastic advocate of M. Keely&quot;.

Also, in November 1895, Mrs. Moore invited Addison B. Burk, president of the Spring Garden Institute, to make an inspection. Burk asked if electrical engineer E. Alexander Scott, of the Engineers&#x27; Club of Philadelphia, could accompany him, which was agreed to. In the event, Scott took charge of the investigation as he was familiar with Keely and had talked to him in 1874.

Scott made several visits to Keely&#x27;s workshop, beginning on November 9, 1895, and was shown many demonstrations. Among these was a levitation experiment where heavy weights in sealed flasks of water were made to rise and fall in response to differently pitched sounds from a zither to activate a &quot;globe liberator&quot;, which then transmitted &quot;the aetheric force&quot; through a wire to the water container. This was shown to many investors and investigators. Burk accompanied Scott on his second and third visits. When the two analyzed what they had seen, they concluded that compressed air had been used in nearly all the experiments, in some cases alongside another more powerful but hidden force. The demonstration with the rising and falling weights was powered by compressed air via a thin tube, which Keely had assured Burk and Scott was a solid wire and which was a common feature in nearly every piece of apparatus in Keely&#x27;s laboratory.

Burk and Scott reported their findings to Mrs. Moore, who was concerned about the negative report and dismissive articles in the press. On March 22, 1896, it was reported that Mrs. Bloomfield Moore had arranged with Professor Wentworth Lascelles Scott of London to investigate Keely&#x27;s claims of etheric force and examine his other inventions. It was said that &quot;an important series of tests will be made in the presence of the scientist&quot;. Lascelles Scott was allowed to examine whatever he wanted and had complete instructions on its use from Keely. After spending a month investigating, Lascelles Scott stated to a meeting of the Franklin Institute that &quot;Keely has demonstrated to me, in a way which is absolutely unquestionable, the existence of a force hitherto unknown.&quot;

Since Lascelles Scott and Alexander Scott disagreed, Keely brought them together to witness more demonstrations. Mrs. Moore suggested that a definitive test would be to cut the wire that Scott alleged was, in fact, an air pipe, but Keely flatly refused to do so, and Mrs. Moore, her faith shaken, reduced Keely&#x27;s monthly salary.

On December 24, 1895, Mrs. Bloomfield Moore said that due to the position taken by the managers of the old Keely Motor Company at the annual meeting and the delay on the part of the stockholders in accepting his proposition for a reorganization, Keely had decided not to take out any patents on his inventions, and would instead adopt a royalty system in dealing with his inventions commercially. Mrs. Moore said that at least 30 patents would be required, which would take much time and money to be better used in developing Keely&#x27;s system.

On June 18, 1897, Keely demonstrated his new etheric engine to the Manhattan Elevated Railway General Manager, the Chief Engineer of Western Union, and a representative of the Metropolitan Traction Company. All were reported as being surprised at the force produced by Keely&#x27;s new motor but declined to express any opinion as to its value. The engine was reported as weighing about and capable of developing 10 hp.

==Death==
Keely died at his home in Philadelphia from pneumonia on November 18, 1898. His will was admitted to probate on December 1, and bequeathed his entire estate of about $10,000 to his widow, Anna M. Keely, who was appointed his executor. The will did not refer to his motor.

Keely is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

The first meeting of the Keely Motor Company&#x27;s stockholders following his death was held on December 20, 1898. Charles S. Hill, his widow&#x27;s attorney, stated that Keely&#x27;s secret did not exist in manuscript form but that Keely had suggested before his death that an inventor, Thomas Burton Kinraide of Boston, was the one man who could successfully carry on his work. Hill then announced that he had a secret that he would pass on to only one person. This secret, he said, was &quot;of a nature to encourage the stockholders and to induce them to leave everything in Kinraide&#x27;s hands for one year&quot;. John J. Smith, one of the Company&#x27;s Directors, was appointed to confer with Hill and later reported that the secret said to him by Hill &quot;offered great encouragement to the stockholders&quot; but did not divulge any further details.

In January 1899, Kinraide had 20 large packing cases transported to his laboratory in Jamaica Plain, Boston, which was said to contain the material part of Keely&#x27;s motor. Kinraide said that he had often talked with Keely about his invention&#x27;s principles and that he felt he knew more about it than any other person. He was to continue with Keely&#x27;s experiments at the request of Mr. and Mrs Keely. However, on May 6, 1899 it was reported that Kinraide had abandoned all work on the Keely motor and was to return all the machines and notes to the Keely Company. He stated that he wanted nothing more to do with the motor due to the notoriety caused him by the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot; report. When asked whether he thought the motor was a fraud, he simply replied that he had not arrived at any such conclusion and had decided to make no further investigations.

===&quot;Philadelphia Press&quot; investigation===
On January 19, 1899, &quot;The Philadelphia Press&quot; published an illustrated article detailing an investigation made by the newspaper of Keely&#x27;s workshop, in which the &quot;Press&quot; contended that the investigation had proven Keely&#x27;s motor to have been &quot;a delusion and deception&quot; and that its alleged mysterious forces were the result of trickery.

The investigation, which took a week, was assisted by consulting engineer Professor Carl Hering, Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Pennsylvania Professor Arthur W. Goodspeed, Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania Lightner Witmer, and Doctor M. G. Miller, who superintended digging operations. Electrical engineer Clarence B. Moore, the son of Mrs. Bloomfield Moore, was an observer. The scientists involved substantiated the report with signed statements.
The floors of Keely&#x27;s workshop were taken up, and a brick wall was removed. Inside the wall, they found mechanical belts linked to a silent water motor two floors below the laboratory. In the basement, a three-ton sphere of compressed air ran the machines through hidden high-pressure tubes and switches. The walls, ceilings, and even solid beams were found to have concealed tubes. Journalists documented everything photographically to leave no room for doubt. Hering and Goodspeed thought that the tubing and the large steel sphere in the basement indicated the use of regular forces and possible deception, and Hering said in his signed statement that Keely had probably lied and deceived and was satisfied that he had used highly compressed air to power his demonstrations.

At a meeting of the Keely Motor Company&#x27;s board on January 25, 1899, President B. L. Ackerman issued a statement denying the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot; report. The statement claimed that the tubes mentioned in the report had been discarded by Keely years before and that in all his experiments since 1887, only solid wires had been used. Up to that time, it was stated that Keely had been working on a theory of etheric or vaporic force and used the tubes to convey this force, but after 1887, he was convinced that he had discovered what he called &quot;vibratory sympathy&quot;. Ackerman described a concealed electric wire discovered in Keely&#x27;s workshop as the remains of the wires of a burglar alarm that were in no way connected with the force used by Keely&#x27;s motor. The statement denied all assertions that Keely was an imposter and declared that there was no trickery in any of the results that Keely had claimed to have obtained.

==Present day==
A model of Keely&#x27;s engine was in the collection of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, and an &quot;Etheric Force Machine&quot; of his dating from 1878 is in the American Precision Museum in Windsor, Vermont.

In 2005, Jeff and Rita Behary found the original glass plate negatives of the Keely Motor taken by Thomas Burton Kinraide in his Jamaica Plain home, Ravenscroft. They show the contents of the Keely Motor and are the last known photos of the motor ever taken.

<text>A Kung Ngam () is a village and an area in northeast Shau Kei Wan in the northeast of Hong Kong Island, in Hong Kong. It contains a fish terminal market, several temples and the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence.
==Name==
&quot;A Kung&quot; literally means maternal grandfather or old man in Cantonese while &quot;Ngam&quot; means rock, but in the case of this place name, &quot;A Kung&quot; refers to Tam Kung, a sea deity who the quarry workers believed in. A temple dedicated to Tam Kung is located in A Kung Ngam.

==History==

A Kung Ngam was a rock quarry in the 19th century, and the area was predominantly inhabited by quarry workers who immigrated from Huizhou and Chaozhou.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of A Kung Ngam was 269. The number of males was 161.

A fire broke out in the early morning of 31 October 2005. Some ten houses in the village were burnt.

=== A Kung Ngam Shipyards ===
A Kung Ngam Shipyards () was a port for export of stone materials in the mid 18th century. As there were so many ships, it became a typhoon shelter and shipyards were built. During the Dragon Boat Festivals, dragon boats races were held in , where dragon boats were once made by the shipyards. At the end of the 20th century, land reclamation from the sea caused fishing boats to anchor elsewhere. Nowadays, the number of shipyards has decreased due to a decrease in number of ships going there.

==Buildings==
Temples in A Kung Ngam include:
* Tam Kung Sin Shing Temple (譚公仙聖廟)
* Yuk Wong Temple
* Fook Tak Temple ()
* A Kung Ngam Lighthouse

==Education==
A Kung Ngam is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 16. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and two government schools: Shau Kei Wan Government Primary School and Aldrich Bay Government Primary School.

<doc id="566083" wikidata="Q1294983" url="?curid=566083" title="Coronet">
<text>In British heraldry, a coronet is a type of crown that is a mark of rank of non-reigning members of the royal family and peers. In other languages, this distinction is not made, and usually the same word for &quot;crown&quot; is used irrespective of rank (, , , , , etc.) In this use, the English &quot;coronet&quot; is a purely technical term for all heraldic images of crowns not used by a sovereign. A Coronet is another type of crown, but is reserved for the nobility - Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts and Barons. The specific design and attributes of the crown or coronet signifies the hierarchy and ranking of its owner.

Certain physical coronets are worn by the British peerage on rare ceremonial occasions, such as the coronation of the monarch. These are also sometimes depicted in heraldry, and called coronets of rank in heraldic usage. Their shape varies depending on the wearer&#x27;s rank in the peerage, according to models laid down in the 16th century. Similar depictions of crowns of rank () are used in continental heraldry, but physical headgear has never been made to imitate them.

Due to the extreme rarity of occasions in which peers&#x27; coronets are worn (sometimes more than fifty years pass before a new coronation and occasion to wear physical coronets), practical use of the term &quot;coronet&quot; today is almost exclusively confined to pictorial crowns and rank symbols in heraldry, adorning someone&#x27;s coat of arms (indeed, many people entitled to a coronet never have a physical one made). Depiction of ordinary crowns or coronets in heraldry, rather than coronets of rank, including a variety of crest coronets sometimes placed under the crest, are not confined to peers, and are often shown in British heraldry outside the peerage. 

==Etymology==
The word stems from the Old French &quot;coronete&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;co(u)ronne&quot; (&#x27;crown&#x27;), itself from the and from the .

Traditionally, such headgear is used by nobles and by princes and princesses in their coats of arms, rather than by monarchs, for whom the word &#x27;crown&#x27; is customarily reserved in English, while many languages have no such terminological distinction. As a coronet shows the rank of the respective noble, in the German and Scandinavian languages there is also the term &quot;rangkrone&quot; (literally &#x27;rank crown&#x27;).
==Usage in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth==

===Royal usage===
Members of the British royal family often display coronets in their coats of arms and may wear actual coronets at coronations (e.g., Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret at the 1937 coronation of their father as George VI). Such coronets were made according to regulations instituted by King Charles II in 1661, shortly after his return from exile in France (getting a taste for its lavish court style; Louis XIV started monumental work at Versailles that year). They vary depending on the individual&#x27;s relationship to the monarch. Occasionally, additional royal warrants vary the designs for individuals.

The most recent (and most comprehensive) royal warrant concerning coronets was the 19 November 1917 warrant of George V. The coronet of the British heir apparent is distinctive in itself, as it has a single arch with a globe and cross. Charles III opted against the use of coronets at his coronation in 2023, for both members of the Royal Family and peers, but he did not abolish the tradition.

===Usage by peers===
In the United Kingdom, a peer traditionally wears a coronet on one occasion only – for a royal coronation, when it is worn along with coronation robes, equally standardised as a luxurious uniform. However, for the 2023 coronation of King Charles III, on the government&#x27;s advice, the King forbade the wearing of coronets by those peers who had been invited, except those performing specific ceremonial roles.

In the peerages of the United Kingdom, the design of a coronet shows the rank of its owner, as in German, French and various other heraldic traditions. Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear coronets. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th, then viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were engraved, while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones. Since people entitled to wear a coronet customarily display it in their coat of arms above the shield and below the helmet and crest, this can provide a useful clue as to the owner of a given coat of arms.

===Table of coronet rankings===
===Municipal usage===
Certain types of local government have special coronet types assigned to them.
===Other uses===
In Canadian heraldry, descendants of the United Empire Loyalists are entitled to use a Loyalist military coronet (for descendants of members of Loyalist regiments) or a Loyalist civil coronet (for others) in their coats of arms.

==Belgian coronet rankings==
These are the heraldic crowns and coronets as they are in use today in the Kingdom of Belgium. In the past, the systems of the German (Holy Roman Empire), Spanish and Austrian monarchies, as well as those of the First French Empire and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, have also be in use on the current Belgian territory.

== Former monarchies ==

=== Kingdom of France ===
The hierarchy among the French nobility, which was identical for non-royal titles to the British hierarchy of peers, should not be understood to be as rigid in the ranking of titleholders as the latter. In particular, a title was not a good indication of actual preeminence or precedence: ancestry, marriages, high office, military rank and the family&#x27;s historical renown counted far more than the precise title. Some distinguished families held a title no higher than count or even baron, but were proud of their ancient origin. Moreover, most of the nobility was legally untitled. Some hereditary titles could be acquired by a nobleman who purchased a &quot;titled&quot; fief, while &quot;titres de courtoisie&quot; (&#x27;courtesy titles&#x27;) were freely assumed in the absence of strict regulation by the French crown and became more numerous than titles legally borne. In the 17th and 18th centuries, people assumed and used freely coronets of ranks that they did not have; and, in the 19th and 20th centuries abuse was still made of &#x27;courtesy titles&#x27;. Titles continued to be granted until the Second Empire fell in 1870, and legally survive among their descendants.

The only title that was never usurped under the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, and rarely without some excuse afterwards, was the title of &quot;duc&quot; – because it was so often attached to the rank of peer of France, which carried specific legal prerogatives, such as the right to a seat in the Parlement of Paris. As a result, the title of &quot;duc&quot; was actually, as well as nominally, at the top of the scale after the royal family and foreign princes, and a cut above all of the other nobility. During the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, &#x27;prince&#x27; was a rank, not a title, hence there was no coronet.
* Roi (sovereign): closed crown of fleurs-de-lis (the crown was open until the early 16th century)
* Dauphin (heir apparent): initially an open crown of fleurs-de-lis; starting with Henri IV&#x27;s son (1601–10), the crown is closed with dolphins instead of arches
* and Petit-fils de France (sons and grandsons of a sovereign): open coronet of fleurs-de-lis
* Prince du sang (male-line descendants of a grandson of the sovereign): originally an open coronet alternating fleurs-de-lis and acanthus leaves (called strawberry leaves in English blazon), but the open coronet of fleurs-de-lis was used in the 17th and 18th centuries
* Pair de France (peer of the realm): coronet of the title (usually duke) with a blue velvet bonnet, along with a mantle &quot;armoyé&quot; (reproducing the arms) fringed with gold and lined with ermine
* Duc (duke): coronet of acanthus leaves
* Marquis (marquess): coronet of alternating acanthus leaves and groups of three pearls in trefoil (or two pearls side by side in some versions)
* Comte (count): coronet of pearls
* Vicomte (viscount): coronet of four large pearls (three visible) alternating with smaller pearls
* Vidame (peculiar French title, for protectors of the temporal estates of a bishopric): coronet of four crosses (three visible)
* Baron: helm of gold wreathed with a string of small pearls
* Chevalier (knight): helm of gold
* Ecuyer (squire): helm

=== Holy Roman Empire ===
The Holy Roman Empire, and consequently its successor states (Austria, Germany and others), had a system very similar to that of the British, although the design varied.
* &quot;Herzogskrone&quot;: the coronet of a &quot;Herzog&quot; (duke) displays five visible leaves, with a crimson bonnet on top, surmounted by five visible arches and a &quot;globus cruciger&quot;.
* &quot;Fürstenkrone&quot;: the coronet of a &quot;Fürst&quot; (ruling prince) shows five visible leaves, with a crimson bonnet on top, surmounted by three visible arches and a &quot;globus cruciger&quot;.
* &quot;Landgrafenkrone&quot;: the coronet of a &quot;Landgraf&quot; (landgrave) shows five visible leaves, surmounted by three visible arches and a &quot;globus cruciger&quot;.
* &quot;Grafenkrone&quot;: the coronet of a &quot;Graf&quot; (count) displays nine visible tines with pearls. Some of the senior comital houses used coronets showing five leaves and four pearls (some mediatized counties and minor principalities had other types of coronets that distinguished them from regular counts).
* &quot;Freiherrnkrone&quot;: the coronet of a (baron) shows seven visible tines with pearls.
* &quot;Adelskrone&quot;: the coronet of &quot;Adel&quot; members (untitled nobility) displays five visible tines with pearls. Sometimes, the central and outer tines are leaves and the other tines are headed by pearls. In the southern states of Bavaria and Württemberg, usually all tines are headed by pearls.
Considering the religious nature of the Holy Roman Empire, one can say that, except for the short-lived Napoleonic states, no continental secular system of heraldry historically was so neatly regulated as under the British crown. Still, there are often traditions (often connected to the Holy Roman Empire, &quot;e.g.&quot;, those in Sweden, Denmark or Russia) that include the use of crown and coronets. While most languages do not have a specific term for coronets, but simply use the word meaning &quot;crown&quot;, it is possible to determine which of those crowns are for peerage or lower-level use, and thus can by analogy be called coronets.

Precisely because there are many traditions and more variation within some of these, there is a plethora of continental coronet types. Indeed, there are also some coronets for positions that do not exist or entitle one to a coronet in the Commonwealth tradition. Such a case in French (&quot;ancien&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, royal era) heraldry, where coronets of rank did not come into use before the 16th century, is the vidame, whose coronet (illustrated) is a metal circle mounted with three visible crosses (there is no documentary or archeological evidence that such a coronet was ever made).

Often, coronets are substituted by helmets, or only worn on a helmet.

==== Austro-Hungarian Monarchy ====
In Austria-Hungary, coronets were usually granted with arms, but sometimes a coronet was not granted.
=== Kingdom of Portugal ===
These coronets and crowns were used in Portuguese heraldry:

* Phra kiao
* For higher clergy such as cardinals, bishops and abbots, the corresponding headdress would be, depending on the occasion and the point during the service, a miter, zuchetto (skullcap), biretta, and the galero, which still appears on their coats of arms

<doc id="566085" wikidata="Q4706771" url="?curid=566085" title="Alan Griffin (politician)">
<text>Alan Peter Griffin (born 23 February 1960) is an Australian lobbyist and former politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1993 to 2016, representing the Victorian seats of Corinella and Bruce for the Australian Labor Party (ALP). He was a public servant, union organiser and ministerial adviser before entering parliament.

==Early life==
Griffin was born on in Melbourne on 23 February 1960. He holds the degree of Bachelor of Arts from the Australian National University.

Prior to entering parliament Griffin worked as a public servant, union organiser and political staffer. He was active in the Federated Clerks&#x27; Union and in 1988 served as Lindsay Tanner&#x27;s campaign manager in his successful bid to become state secretary of the union, the culmination of &quot;a bitter factional battle to wrest the union from right-wing control&quot;. He was an adviser to Victorian state government minister Kay Setches from 1990 to 1991 and to federal government minister Simon Crean from 1991 to 1993. He also served on the Springvale City Council from 1991 to 1993.

==Political career==
Griffin joined the ALP in 1979 and was chosen as a delegate to state conference in 1984. He was secretary of the party&#x27;s Springvale South branch from 1990 to 1993.

Griffin was first elected to Parliament at the 1993 federal election, unseating the Liberal incumbent in Corinella, Russell Broadbent. He became a backbench supporter of Prime Minister Paul Keating&#x27;s government. Corinella was abolished for the 1996 election, and Griffin followed most of his constituents into Bruce.

That seat had been in Liberal hands since its creation in 1955. However, it had been significantly altered by the latest redistribution, which gave Labor a slim majority. Griffin defeated Liberal incumbent Julian Beale by only 1195 votes, making him one of the few bright spots in Labor&#x27;s severe defeat that year.

Griffin was elected to the Opposition Shadow Ministry in October 1998. He was Shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs and Shadow Minister Assisting the Shadow Minister for Health from 2003 to 2005. In June 2005, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Shadow Special Minister of State.

After Labor won government back in the 2007 federal election, new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appointed Griffin Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs in the ministry. On 1 April 2010, he gained the portfolio of Minister for Defence Personnel. He retained these portfolios in Julia Gillard&#x27;s first ministry but chose not to continue in the Second Gillard Ministry, which was sworn in on 14 September 2010 following the 2010 election.

In the lead-up to the 2012 Australian Labor Party leadership spill, following continued leadership tensions between Rudd and Gillard, Griffin was reported to be a &quot;main numbers man&quot; for Rudd and publicly criticised federal treasurer Wayne Swan for suggesting that Rudd was destabilising Gillard.

On 10 February 2015, Griffin announced he would not contest the next election, due in 2016. In March 2015, former City of Port Phillip Mayor Julian Hill was preselected unopposed to contest Bruce for the Labor Party.

==Later activities==
Griffin began working as a lobbyist after leaving parliament, joining The Civic Group. he was listed on both the Victorian and federal registers of lobbyists and had been engaged to lobby on behalf of the owners of the Maddingley coal mine. In 2024, he and his former ministerial colleague Stephen Conroy were reported to be among the most influential lobbyists in Canberra, following the ALP&#x27;s return to power at the 2022 election.

Griffin was described in 2021 as &quot;a key powerbroker within Victorian Labor&quot; who had been crucial in brokering a factional truce that allowed Sam Rae to win preselection for the seat of Hawke.

<text>Pico de Orizaba, also known as Citlaltépetl (from Nahuatl = star, and = mountain), is an active volcano, the highest mountain in Mexico and third highest in North America, after Denali of United States and Mount Logan of Canada. Pico de Orizaba is also the highest volcano in North America. It rises above sea level in the eastern end of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, on the border between the states of Veracruz and Puebla. The volcano is currently dormant but not extinct, with the last eruption taking place during the 19th century. It is the second most prominent volcanic peak in the world after Mount Kilimanjaro. Pico de Orizaba is ranked 16th by topographic isolation.

==Toponymy==
Pico de Orizaba overlooks the valley and city of Orizaba, from which it gets its Spanish name, i.e., Orizaba&#x27;s peak. During the colonial era, the volcano was also known as Cerro de San Andrés due to the nearby settlement of San Andrés Chalchicomula at its base.

Its Náhuatl name, Citlaltépetl, comes from &quot;citlalli&quot; (star) and tepētl (mountain) and thus means &quot;Star Mountain&quot;. This name is thought to be based on the fact that the snow-covered peak can be seen year round for hundreds of kilometers throughout the region. This name is not, however, used by Náhuatl speakers of the Orizaba area, who instead call it &quot;Istaktepetl&quot; (&quot;Iztactépetl&quot; in the traditional orthography for Classical Nahuatl), meaning &#x27;White Mountain&#x27;.

A third name, Poyauhtecatl, which means &quot;the one that colours or illuminates&quot;, has also been recorded. This name was given by the Tlaxcaltecs in memory of their lost country.

==Topography==
The peak of Citlaltépetl rises dramatically to an elevation of above sea level; it has a topographic prominence of . Regionally dominant, Pico de Orizaba is the highest peak in Mexico and the highest volcano in North America; it is also the third highest peak in North America after Denali and Mount Logan. Orizaba is ranked 7th in the world in topographic prominence. It is the second most prominent volcanic peak in the world after Africa&#x27;s Mount Kilimanjaro, and the volcano is ranked 16th in the world for topographic isolation. About to the west of the port of Veracruz, its peak is visible to ships approaching the port in the Gulf of Mexico, and at dawn rays of sunlight strike the Pico while Veracruz still lies in shadow. The topography of Pico de Orizaba is asymmetrical from the center of the crater; the eastern face is the steepest side of the volcano and the northwestern face the most gradual side. The gradual slopes of the northwestern face of the volcano allow for the presence of large glaciers and provide the most traveled route for hikers traveling to the summit.

==Glaciers==
Pico de Orizaba is one of only three volcanoes in México that continue to support glaciers and is home to the largest glacier in Mexico, Gran Glaciar Norte. Orizaba has nine known glaciers: Gran Glaciar Norte, Lengua del Chichimeco, Jamapa, Toro, Glaciar de la Barba, Noroccidental, Occidental, Suroccidental, and Oriental. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is not known for Orizaba. Snow on the south and southeast sides of the volcano melts quickly because of solar radiation, but lower temperatures on the northwest and north sides allow for glaciers. The insolation angle and wind redeposition on the northwest and north sides allow for constant accumulation of snow providing a source for the outlet glaciers. On the north side of Orizaba, the Gran Glaciar Norte fills the elongated highland basin and is the source for seven outlet glaciers. The main glacier extends north of the crater rim, has a surface area of about descending from to about . It has a slightly irregular and stepped profile that is caused in part by the configuration of the bedrock. Most crevasses show an ice thickness of approximately .
Below the in elevation on the north side of the volcano, the outlet glaciers Lengua del Chichimeco and Jamapa extend north and northwest another and , respectively. The terminal lobe of Lengua del Chichimeco at , having a gradient of only , is a low, broad ice fan that has a convex-upward profile, a front typical of almost all Mexican glaciers. The most distinct glacier is Glaciar de Jamapa, which leaves Gran Glaciar Norte at about and, after with a gradient of , divides into two small tongues that end at and . Both tongues terminate in broad convex-upward ice fans thinning along their edges. The retreat of these tongues prior to 1994 produced much erosion downstream and buried their edges by ablation rock debris.

The west side of Gran Glaciar Norte generates five outlet glaciers. From north to south, the first two, Glaciar del Toro and Glaciar de la Barba, are hanging cliff or icefall glaciers, reaching the tops of giant lava steps at and , respectively. They then descend farther down into the heads of stream valleys as huge ice blocks but are not regenerated there. About , Glaciar Noroccidental, a small outlet glacier long, drains away from the side of Gran Glaciar Norte at about and draws down the ice surface a few tens of meters over a distance of , descending to with a gradient of . Another still farther south, Glaciar Occidental breaks away from Gran Glaciar Norte west of the summit crater at about as a steep, long glacier having a gradient of that ends at . From the southwest corner of the mountain, another outlet glacier, Glaciar Suroccidental, long, flows from Gran Glaciar Norte at with a gradient of , which also ends at in a long smooth surface.

East of the summit cone, a separate steep niche glacier, Glaciar Oriental, long and having a gradient of , flows down the mountainside from about ; it contains many crevasses and seracs and is the most difficult glacier to climb. Glacier Oriental had a surface area of about in 1958, which makes the total area of glaciers and firn field on Citlaltépetl about . No earlier historical record of glacier tongue activity (advance or recession) is known for Citlaltépetl&#x27;s glaciers. Although the Gran Glaciar Norte ice cap is covered with snow, it is possible to see the seven outlet glaciers on the irregular west margin of the ice cap, especially Glaciar de Jamapa and Glaciar Occidental.

==Climate==
The climate of Pico de Orizaba, like the Sierra Madre Oriental, varies greatly due to the change of elevation and prevailing winds. Due to the latitude and the extreme rugged terrain the volcano experiences many microclimates. Vegetation varies from tropical at the lower elevations on the eastern face to alpine forests in the higher elevations.

Large amounts of precipitation fall on the eastern face of the volcano due to adiabatic cooling and condensation from the trade winds that bring moisture off the Gulf of Mexico. The eastern face is frequently covered by fog and low cloud cover. The climate of the eastern face varies from tropical (Af) at the lower elevations to subtropical highland (Cfb) at the higher elevations, with mild variation in temperatures and an average annual rainfall of .

Subtropical climates are found between above sea level with a regular rainfall all year long. Autumn and winter come with frequent freezes and light snow, but the snow on the south and southeast sides melt quickly due to solar radiation. The northern face is dominated by subtropical highland (Cwb). The southern face mostly experiences a humid subtropical climate, (Cwa) with the highest annual temperatures in the month of April.

Due to katabatic winds the western side is dominated by steppe (BSk) creating a rain shadow below above sea level. Although there are some areas on the western side that experience (Cfa) most of the area is semi-dry with temperate to warm temperatures and an annual precipitation average of . Vegetation here is grass and shrubs with few alpine species.

Between , where temperatures usually are between , a cold-summer version of the subtropical highland climate (Cfc) predominates. Over with an annual average low of , alpine tundra (ET) prevails to the summit; heavy snowfalls and blizzards are common throughout the year. Snow on the south and southeast melts due to solar radiation, but continually remains on the north and northwestern faces. Extreme cold dominates a surface area of approximately .

==Geology==
Pico de Orizaba evolved in three stages, the most recent initiated about 16,000 years ago during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Citlaltépetl consists of three superimposed stratovolcanoes and dome intrusions: Torrecillas (650–250 ka), Espolón de Oro (210– 16 ka), and Citlaltépetl (16 ka to present). The volcano was formed by thick andesitic and dacitic lavas that followed repetitive explosive eruptions and lava effusions that created the iconic cone structure. The volcano is currently dormant but not extinct. The latest eruption of the volcano occurred in 1846 with a magnitude of VEI 2. Previous eruptions occurred in: 1687, 1613, 1589–1569, 1566, 1555–1545,1539–1533, 1351, 1260, 1187, 1175, 1157, 220 AD, 140 AD, 90 AD, 40 AD, ~780 BC, ~1500 BC, ~2110 BC, ~2300 BC, ~2500 BC, ~2780 BC, ~4690 BC, ~6220 BC, ~6710 BC, ~7030 BC, and ~7530 BC. The most violent eruption in the volcano&#x27;s history is thought to have occurred around 6710 BC, reaching a magnitude of VEI 5, characterized by lava dome extrusion and pyroclastic flow.

The volcano&#x27;s crater is elliptical with a transverse diameter measuring and a conjugate diameter measuring . The crater has an estimated with a maximum depth of . Pico de Orizaba is constantly covered by an ice cap consisting of several glaciers. An outlet glacier, known as Jamapa Glacier, is located on the north-eastern side of the peak; it has been a powerful force in shaping the volcano. The Jamapa Glacier is responsible for a significant portion of the geomorphologic evolution of the region surrounding the volcano.

==Geography==

Pico de Orizaba is located at 19°1′48″N 97°16′12″W, about west of the Gulf of Mexico and east of Mexico City, on the border between the states of Veracruz and Puebla. The volcano is approximately south of the Tropic of Cancer. Orizaba anchors the south-eastern end of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, a volcanic chain that runs from west to east across Central Mexico. A companion peak lying about six km to the southwest of Pico de Orizaba is the Sierra Negra, at . This subsidiary peak is significantly lower than its massive neighbour, but the road to the observatory on its summit is the highest road in North America.

Pico de Orizaba, as part of the Sierra Madre Oriental, forms a barrier between the coastal plains of the Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican Plateau. The volcano blocks the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico from saturating central Mexico and influences the climates of both areas. Both the state of Veracruz and Puebla depend on Pico de Orizaba for supplying fresh water. The largest river originating on the volcano is the Jamapa River.

==History==

Pico de Orizaba was important in pre-Hispanic cultures, such as those of the Nahuatl-speaking Aztecs and the Totonacs. The volcano is part of many native mythologies.

During the Spanish Conquest of Mexico, Hernán Cortés passed through the foothills of Pico de Orizaba; the volcano and the surrounding mountains made his journey to Tenochtitlan more difficult and delayed him for many days. During the 1600s, the Spanish Crown financed several roads to be built that would circumvent Citlaltépetl. One of the roads was routed south of the volcano through the cities of Orizaba and Fortín de las Flores, which became the main trade route between Mexico City and Veracruz on the Gulf Coast. A short road was later built by Jesuits to establish settlements at the base of Pico de Orizaba. The Spanish used the volcano as a landmark to guide themselves to the port of Veracruz. Many battles were fought near this volcano throughout Mexico&#x27;s struggle for independence.

In 1839, Henri Galeotti was the first European to explore the volcano, but did not hike to the summit. During the American occupation of Mexico in 1848, two American soldiers, F. Maynard and William F. Raynolds, were the first known hikers to reach the summit of Pico de Orizaba. In 1851, the French explorer Alejandro Doignon also reached the summit and found the flagpole left behind by the Americans in 1848. During the mid-19th century Citlaltépetl was explored by many scientists, including the German botanist Hugo Fink, who was the first to record the numerous species of flora found on the volcano. In 1873, Martin Tritschler raised the Mexican flag at the summit.

==Pico de Orizaba National Park==
On December 16, 1936, President Lázaro Cárdenas, in an effort to protect the natural beauty of Pico de Orizaba, created a national park with an area of that included the volcano with the surrounding area and the settlements of Tlachichuca, Ciudad Serdán, La Perla, Mariano Escobedo, and Calcahualco. The federal decree became federal law on January 4, 1937.

==Climbing and recreation==

Pico de Orizaba attracts a large number of international climbers every year. There are multiple routes for approaching and climbing the volcano, and many people attempt it. Most people climb the mountain during the period from October to March when the weather is favorable; temperatures do not vary much month to month due to being in the tropics and April through September are rainy months in the region. The most frequented route begins from the base camp Piedra Grande Hut (&quot;refugio&quot;) via the Jamapa Glacier, located at an elevation of above sea level.

Another option as a starting point is high camp located at the base of the glacier about above sea level. For a more technical challenge for the experienced climber, there is a technical ice climb called the Serpents Head, which involves 10 pitches of grade 3 ice. Additionally, the southern side offers another challenging option; although the trail is shorter, it is also steeper and more difficult. No glaciers are found on the southern side. The final ascent to the summit is via a normally straightforward and crevasse-free glacier route. The caldera can be circumnavigated with relative ease, although at one point this requires a short, exposed traverse of steep rock and ice above the Glacier Este.

<text>Landon Timothy Donovan (born March 4, 1982) is an American former professional soccer player and coach who was most recently the interim head coach of San Diego Wave FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL). Widely regarded as one of the greatest U.S. 
players of all time, Donovan holds the world record for the man with the most international assists (58), and is tied with Clint Dempsey for the most international goals scored by a male U.S. player (57).

An early soccer product of IMG Academy, Donovan signed for Bayer Leverkusen in 1999. In 2005, after six years with Leverkusen, the majority of which were spent on loan with the San Jose Earthquakes of MLS, Donovan moved back to the United States permanently to sign with the Los Angeles Galaxy. He later returned to Germany for a loan with Bayern Munich, and twice went on short loans to English Premier League club Everton in 2010 and 2012. He retired as a player in 2014, but made a brief comeback with LA Galaxy late in the 2016 season and then in 2018 to play for León. He further played one season with the San Diego Sockers of the Major Arena Soccer League. Overall Donovan won a record six MLS Cups and is the league&#x27;s all-time assists leader with 136. The Major League Soccer MVP Award has been renamed the Landon Donovan MVP Award in his honor.

Donovan made his senior debut for the United States men&#x27;s national team in 2000. He is the all-time leader in assists, tied with Clint Dempsey as the all-time leader in scoring, and is the second-most-capped player of his country. Donovan is the only American player to reach the 50 goals/50 assists mark. He is tied with Christian Pulisic for the record of four U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year awards (the first man to win in consecutive years), as well as the only seven-time winner of the Player of the Year award. Donovan starred in the U.S. team that reached the quarter-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup where he received the Best Young Player Award. His three goals in the 2010 World Cup made Donovan the highest-scoring male American player in World Cup history.

==Early life and education==
Landon Timothy Donovan was born (along with twin sister Tristan) on March 4, 1982, in Ontario, California, to Donna Kenney-Cash, an American special education teacher, and Tim Donovan, a semi-professional ice hockey player originally from Canada. Donovan&#x27;s parents are both of Irish descent, and he holds Canadian citizenship by way of his father. His mother raised Landon and his siblings in Redlands, California, and he attended Redlands East Valley High School when not engaged in soccer activities elsewhere.

Donovan first played soccer with his older brother and when Donovan was six, his mother allowed him to join an organized league, where he scored seven goals in his first match. Donovan was a member of Cal Heat – a club based in nearby Rancho Cucamonga, California. In 1997, he was accepted into U.S. Youth Soccer&#x27;s Olympic Development Program. In 1999 Donovan attended the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, with other members of the U-17 national team as part of U.S. Soccer&#x27;s youth development program. Donovan was a member of the inaugural class of the U.S. Soccer youth residency program in Bradenton, Florida. He was named Player of the Tournament for his role in the United States under-17 squad that finished fourth in the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship before signing with German club Bayer Leverkusen later that year.

==Club career==
===Bayer Leverkusen and San Jose Earthquakes===
Later in 1999, Donovan signed a six-year contract for German Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen, whose sporting director Michael Reschke spotted him at a youth tournament in Europe. Despite becoming a regular starter for the club&#x27;s reserve team upon arrival, Donovan had trouble adapting to life overseas and was allowed extended training periods with United States youth national teams. He played in a German Cup match for the reserve team. Unhappy with his situation with Leverkusen, Donovan was loaned to the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer (MLS) for the 2001 season. In MLS, Donovan had immediate success, leading the Earthquakes to MLS Cup championships in 2001 and 2003 and becoming one of the only recognizable faces of soccer in the United States. In four years in the league, he scored 32 goals and 29 assists in league play, and ten goals and six assists in the playoffs. Two of those goals were in the 2003 MLS Cup, a 4–2 Earthquakes triumph over Chicago Fire SC. Donovan earned Man of the Match for his actions. He was named U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year in 2003.

In 2004, Donovan became the first man to be named the U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year three years in a row before returning to the Bayer Leverkusen first team in January 2005. After playing seven matches with Leverkusen in the 2004–05 season, only two of which were starts, Donovan requested to leave the club. Despite a late offer from English Premier League club Portsmouth, Donovan expressed a desire to return to the United States. Upon his re-entry to MLS, San Jose was denied the chance to re-sign Donovan because Earthquakes general manager Alexi Lalas had traded away his rights. LA Galaxy, his hometown team, were able to trade leading scorer Carlos Ruiz to FC Dallas to get on top of the MLS allocation order as Donovan prepared to leave Germany.

===LA Galaxy===
====2005–2014====
Donovan signed a multi-year contract with LA Galaxy, making him the highest-paid American player in the league. In his first season at the club, Donovan scored 12 league goals with 10 assists and added four goals and an assist in the playoffs as LA Galaxy won the MLS Cup (his third MLS championship to date). He was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI after the season. In his second season with LA Galaxy, Donovan scored 12 league goals and eight assists. He also scored three goals in the Open Cup. Despite this, Donovan and LA Galaxy failed to make the playoffs and lost in the Open Cup to Chicago Fire. Donovan&#x27;s playoff goals make him MLS&#x27; second all-time leading scorer in the playoffs with 14, behind Carlos Ruiz&#x27;s 15.

Donovan had a mixed year with LA Galaxy in 2007. Upon the signing and arrival of David Beckham, Donovan relinquished his captaincy to the English superstar. In the 2007 SuperLiga tournament, Donovan was the top scorer. He scored a goal in every match except for the final. He scored six goals in five matches. At this point in his career, Donovan had 84 all-time regular season goals putting him in seventh place on the league&#x27;s all-time scoring list. Although the 2008 season was a disappointment for LA Galaxy, it was a banner year for Donovan as he scored 20 goals and nine assists in 25 matches, forming a strong offensive partnership with David Beckham and Edson Buddle.

After his former national team manager Bruce Arena was named LA Galaxy head coach and Beckham joined Milan on loan in early 2009, Donovan once again was given the club captaincy on a permanent basis. In July 2009, Donovan received praise and criticism for his critical comments about Beckham in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; journalist Grant Wahl&#x27;s book &quot;The Beckham Experiment&quot;, calling Beckham a poor captain and teammate. He later apologized to Beckham for discussing his concerns to a reporter rather than to him directly. The two reconciled upon Beckham&#x27;s mid-season return to Los Angeles and Donovan enjoyed an outstanding 2009 campaign, winning the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player and MLS Goal of The Year 2009 award and leading LA Galaxy to MLS Cup 2009, which they lost 5-4 on penalties to Real Salt Lake after 1-1 draw despite after Galaxy&#x27;s best season, Donovan missed the fourth penalty which would lead Galaxy winning the MLS Cup. Following the season, Donovan agreed to a four-year extension to his contract with LA Galaxy, with clauses that allow him to seek loans during the MLS offseason. On August 1, 2010, Donovan scored the 100th goal of his MLS career. On September 18, 2010, he became the all-time leading scorer for LA Galaxy.

LA Galaxy had another successful campaign in 2010 winning the Supporters&#x27; Shield for the first time since 2003. In that campaign, Donovan scored seven goals and a team-high 16 assists. In the playoffs, LA Galaxy would ultimately succumb to Dallas in the semi-finals.

In 2011, LA Galaxy again won the MLS Supporter&#x27;s Shield. In the MLS Cup 2011, Donovan scored the title-clinching goal in the 72nd minute over the Houston Dynamo, securing his fourth MLS Cup title.
Donovan was named the MLS Cup MVP.

In October 2012, Donovan expressed his desire to take a break from his professional soccer career, citing physical and mental exhaustion as the main reasons. In LA Galaxy&#x27;s next match, the MLS Cup 2012, a rematch with Houston, Donovan converted a penalty kick in the 65th minute of play to give LA a 2–1 lead. The goal was Donovan&#x27;s fifth in MLS Cup Finals. LA Galaxy went on to win their second straight MLS Cup, 3–1.

Donovan returned to training with LA Galaxy on March 25, 2013, and made his season debut five days later against Toronto, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute. However, upon his return, it was announced he would be forced to relinquish the captaincy to Robbie Keane for the 2013 season. He scored two goals against Chivas USA, tying him with Jeff Cunningham together as the top MLS goalscorer with 134 goals. On May 25, 2014, Donovan scored twice against the Philadelphia Union to break Cunningham&#x27;s record of 134, making Donovan MLS&#x27;s All-Time leading goalscorer with 136 goals. On August 6, 2014, he scored the winning goal at the 2014 MLS All-Star Game, putting the ball past Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at the 70th minute, he was subsequently substituted for Sporting Kansas City striker Dom Dwyer and gave the captain&#x27;s armband to Canadian international Will Johnson. On August 7, 2014, Donovan announced he would be retiring at the end of the 2014 Major League Soccer season; the season ended with LA Galaxy winning MLS Cup 2014 as well their fourth MLS Cup of the Donovan era on December 7, 2014.

====Loans to other clubs====
In November 2008, Donovan trained with Bayern Munich, before joining the German club on loan until the start of the 2009 MLS season in mid-March. During his stay with Bayern, Donovan had appearances in five friendly matches, in which he scored four goals, six league matches and one DFB-Pokal match. At the end of the loan period, Bayern declined to extend his loan.

After the 2009 MLS season had finished, Donovan joined English Premier League side Everton on loan in January 2010, though there was strong suggestions he could join his American teammates at Fulham. During this period, he played in 13 matches in all competitions, scored two goals and was named the club&#x27;s Player of the Month for January. Everton were keen on extending his loan deal, but LA Galaxy refused, and Donovan returned to the U.S. in time for the start of the 2010 MLS season.

An agreement was reached in December 2011 for Donovan to spend another two months at Everton beginning in January 2012. He made his returning debut on January 4, 2012, against Bolton Wanderers, a 2–1 defeat. In his third match on loan, he assisted Everton&#x27;s only goal in a 1–1 draw against Aston Villa on January 14. On January 27, he assisted in both goals in a 2–1 win over Fulham in the FA Cup fourth round proper. On January 31, he assisted in Darron Gibson&#x27;s winning goal over Manchester City. Donovan took his tally of assists to seven when he assisted Denis Stracqualursi&#x27;s goal in a 2–0 victory over Chelsea on February 11.

===Return to LA Galaxy===
On September 8, 2016, Donovan announced his return from retirement and officially signed with LA Galaxy for the remainder of the 2016 season (six regular season games and any consecutive play-off matches).

Donovan explained that the injuries sustained by the club late in the season led to his decision to return:

Two weeks ago, I was working as an analyst on the LA Galaxy vs. Vancouver Whitecaps match and during that game, LA Galaxy suffered injuries to three players: Jelle Van Damme, Steven Gerrard and Gyasi Zardes. Over the next few days, Nigel De Jong was transferred to Galatasaray and news broke that Gyasi would be out for the rest of the season.

Since my retirement, I have remained in close contact with many of the staff and players on LA Galaxy. I spoke with some of them that week and they jokingly asked if I was ready to make a return to the field to help fill some of the void left by the injuries and departures.

I reminded them that I haven&#x27;t played a meaningful soccer game in almost two years and I certainly couldn&#x27;t fill the holes left by those players. Over the ensuing days, I began to think about their inquiries and it struck me that perhaps this is something I should consider. I care so deeply about the Galaxy organization, and I believe I could help in a small way to aid the team in its quest for a sixth MLS championship.

On September 11, 2016, Donovan entered the match against Orlando City as a substitute on the 83rd minute. As his traditional number 10 was worn by Giovani dos Santos, Donovan selected number 26, which he wore at Bayer Leverkusen when he began his career in 1999.

Donovan scored a goal in his second match after returning to LA Galaxy. On September 18, 2016, he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute in a match against Sporting Kansas City and scored two minutes later to tie the game 2–2.

Altogether, Donovan played in all six remaining matches of the 2016 regular season, as well as in all three play-off matches. He started in five of them and scored one goal. At the end of the play-off run, Donovan retired for the second time.

===León===

On January 12, 2018, Donovan signed with Liga MX team León, having returned from retirement for a second time. He made his Liga MX debut on February 10, 2018, coming on as a substitute in the 83rd minute of León&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Club Puebla. He scored his first goal for the club on March 24, 2018, in a friendly against his former team, the San Jose Earthquakes On June 17, 2018, Club León announced they had decided to terminate Donovan&#x27;s contract early.

===San Diego Sockers===

On January 24, 2019, Donovan signed with the San Diego Sockers in the Major Arena Soccer League. He provided an assist in a 6–4 win over the Tacoma Stars during his MASL debut on February 15 in front of a record crowd in Pechanga Arena San Diego. He scored his first two goals for the Sockers in the next game for a 13–2 win over Turlock Express, opening the scoring after just 12 seconds. Donovan was named to MASL&#x27;s Week 14 Team of the Week and also named him as a 2018–19 All-MASL Top Newcomer.

==International career==
Donovan was a member of the inaugural class at U.S. Soccer&#x27;s full-time residency program for the under-17 national team at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. In his two years playing for the U-17 team, he scored 35 goals in 41 games and won the Golden Ball at the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship as the tournament&#x27;s best player. He also represented the United States at the 1999 Pan American Games. In 2000, he moved up to both the United States U-23 men&#x27;s national soccer team as well as the senior team. Despite this he played for the United States U-20 men&#x27;s national soccer team in 2001. On March 20, 2001, he was involved in a collision with Marvin Lee, the captain of Trinidad and Tobago U-20 team during the 2001 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament in Trinidad. Lee collided head to side with Donovan which resulted in Lee being paralyzed after sustaining neck and spine injuries, while Donovan had fractured ribs. Lee died in 2003 from complications caused by his condition, the stadium now carries his name.

Donovan made his World Cup finals debut in the 2002 World Cup starting in the shock upset of pre-tournament favorites Portugal, a match the Americans won 3–2. Donovan&#x27;s cross in the 29th minute deflected in off Jorge Costa, giving the U.S. a 2–0 lead. Later, Donovan would tally his first World Cup finals goal in the 83rd minute of a 3–1 loss to Poland in the third match of the group stage. He then scored his second goal of the tournament on a header which clinched a 2–0 round of 16 victory for the Americans over arch-rival Mexico. Though the U.S. would go on to lose 1–0 to Germany in the quarter-finals, Donovan would later be named Best Young Player of the tournament.

Donovan was a member of the U.S. squad at the 2006 World Cup, in which the Americans were eliminated in the group stage. Failing to provide any goals or assists throughout the three matches, he was widely criticized by American viewers for his performance. The following year, he led the U.S. to the 2007 Gold Cup title with four goals, including a crucial penalty in the 2–1 victory over Mexico in the final. On January 19, 2008, Donovan scored his 35th international goal, a penalty against Sweden, and passed Eric Wynalda as the United States&#x27; all-time leading goal scorer. Donovan reached 100 caps at age 26 on June 8, 2008, in a friendly against Argentina that ended in a 0–0 draw, becoming the fourth-youngest person to do so. Donovan captained the U.S. in the group stage of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup due to Carlos Bocanegra&#x27;s injury absence. Donovan scored on a penalty kick against Italy, shortly after his team had been reduced to ten men, and scored for the U.S. in a 3–2 defeat to Brazil in the final. On October 10, 2009, Donovan scored on a free-kick, giving the U.S. a 3–2 victory over Honduras in San Pedro Sula that clinched World Cup qualification.

Donovan played every minute of the U.S. campaign at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He scored against Slovenia with a powerful close-range finish to begin a U.S. comeback for a 2–2 draw, and the only goal in the dying seconds of a 1–0 defeat of Algeria with a finish off a rebounded Clint Dempsey attempt, leading the U.S. to first place in their World Cup group for the first time since 1930. Donovan scored a penalty in the round of 16 against Ghana as the U.S. lost 2–1 after extra time and were eliminated from the competition. His goals in South Africa made Donovan the highest scoring American male in World Cup history, and just the third American man to score in more than one World Cup, after Brian McBride and Clint Dempsey. His total of five World Cup goals is the most for any man representing a team from CONCACAF.

After missing the first two World Cup qualifiers of 2013 due to his extended off-season sabbatical, Donovan was left off of the squad by Jürgen Klinsmann for the June qualifying matches, despite having returned to playing full-time in March. However, Donovan was re-called to the national team for the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup to be played in July. On July 5, 2013, he became the first U.S. player to reach the 50 international goal mark and the fourth man in CONCACAF to score 50 international goals after a brace against Guatemala in a warmup friendly before the Gold Cup. Four days later, Donovan became the first player to reach 50 goals and 50 assists for the United States during a 6–1 group stage victory in their 2013 Gold Cup opener against Belize in which he had one goal and two assists. After the U.S. won the Gold Cup title with a 1–0 victory over Panama, Donovan was awarded the tournament&#x27;s Best Player trophy after tying for the tournament lead with five goals scored. He started every match of the tournament for the United States. Donovan was recalled to the full national squad for the first time in over a year for the U.S.&#x27;s September World Cup qualifying matches against Costa Rica and Mexico. Donovan started and played 90 minutes in both games. With the U.S. needing a win over Mexico to clinch qualification, Donovan&#x27;s corner kick assisted Eddie Johnson&#x27;s go-ahead goal in the 57th minute. Then, in the 78th minute, Donovan scored off a low cross from Mix Diskerud to make the score 2–0, and effectively seal the win, and the World Cup berth.

In May 2014, Donovan was named in the preliminary squad for the 2014 World Cup and joined the team in training camp. However, on May 22, 2014, he was controversially omitted from the final U.S. squad by manager Jürgen Klinsmann. Donovan&#x27;s absence from the team even became the comedic subject of a PlayStation Commercial where Donovan makes light of his newly found free time. Klinsmann later called his decision &quot;one of the toughest decisions in [his] coaching career&quot;, but said, &quot;I just think the other guys right now are a little bit ahead of him.&quot; Klinsmann&#x27;s decision, which was described by media staff as abruptly timed after Klinsmann had previously promised to wait until after the team&#x27;s friendly matches to announce cuts, saw additional controversy when Klinsmann&#x27;s son Jonathan published and later deleted a post on Twitter that appeared to ridicule Donovan following the announcement.

On October 10, 2014, Donovan played his 157th and final match for the United States in a friendly against Ecuador in East Hartford, Connecticut. The match was arranged by United States Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati to give Donovan a proper farewell, despite the disagreement between Donovan and Klinsmann. Following his retirement, he was named by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the U.S. team&#x27;s greatest ever player.

After playing in the Major Arena Soccer League during the 2018–19 season, Donovan was named to the United States national arena soccer team ahead of a friendly against Mexico.

==Style of play==
Donovan was a versatile attacker known for his pace and stamina as well as intelligence and technical skill, allowing him to play at various forward and midfield positions at different points of his career. His longtime international and club manager Bruce Arena was once quoted as saying, &quot;the problem with Landon is that he&#x27;s your best player at so many positions that you never know where to put him.&quot;

Particularly in the early parts of his career, Donovan played as a withdrawn striker and was most noted for his quickness and goalscoring ability. As his professional career progressed, Donovan was increasingly utilized by managers as a wide attacking midfielder, where he could additionally benefit the team with his playmaking abilities, passing vision, and defensive work rate. Donovan also provided capable delivery on set pieces (as well as occasionally scoring from direct kicks) and served as first-choice penalty taker for club and country for much of his career.

== Coaching career ==

=== MLS Homegrown Game ===
In July 2015, it was announced Donovan had been appointed as head coach for a team consisting of young MLS players for the 2015 MLS Homegrown Game. The game took place on July 28, 2015, at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado. Donovan led a team of MLS academy graduates, assembled just one day prior, to a 1–1 regulation tie, followed by a 4–5 shootout loss, as reported online. Donovan selected and coached the team a second time in the 2016 edition of the event.

=== San Diego Loyal ===
On November 14, 2019, Landon Donovan was named the inaugural manager of the San Diego Loyal, a team that he helped co-found and was the vice president of soccer operations. Noting that his hiring was a risk for the club because he had never coached before, Donovan surrounded himself with an experienced backroom staff. He brought on former coach Paul Buckle and former United States women&#x27;s national soccer team player Shannon MacMillan as senior advisors to his staff. While also bringing in experienced coaches in Carrie Taylor, Nate Miller and Matt Hall to his staff. Donovan noted that he wanted a staff with experienced coaches because they could aid him with the day-to-day responsibilities with a coaching role that he was unfamiliar with.

During his first season in charge, Donovan lead San Diego to 6-5-5 record. Donovan and the Loyal garnered international headlines when they forfeited the last two matches of the season after having alleged instances of racial and homophobic abuse directed at their players by the Los Angeles Galaxy II and Phoenix Rising respectively went unpunished. After the second instance, where Phoenix Rising player Junior Flemmings allegedly directed a homophobic slur against openly gay San Diego player Collin Martin, Donovan stated: &quot;We went through a really hard incident in the LA match and we made a vow to ourselves, our community, our players, the club and the USL that we would not stand for bigotry, homophobic slurs and things that don&#x27;t belong in our game. Our players in the heart and passion of the moment still wanted to play, but if we wanted to be true to who we are as a club, we have to speak and we have to act. After half-time we all decided if the player who used the homophobic slur was not removed from the game – either by the officials or by his coach – we would not play. If they are not willing to act, we have to act.&quot;

On December 2, 2022, Donovan was elevated to full-time Executive Vice President of Soccer Operations for Loyal. Associate head coach Nate Miller was promoted to head coach.

On October 23, 2023, The San Diego Loyal dissolved as a result of the inability to find a stadium and the MLS expanding to San Diego.

===San Diego Wave===

On August 16, 2024, Donovan was announced as the interim head coach of National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL) club San Diego Wave FC, replacing interim coach Paul Buckle. Donovan&#x27;s tenure as interim head coach ended on November 18, 2024.

== Off the field career ==

=== Broadcasting career ===
After being left off the 2014 World Cup roster for the United States, Donovan joined the ESPN/ABC broadcast team for the World Cup as a studio analyst. After his retirement, Donovan became a color commentator for FOX Sports, participating in the network&#x27;s coverage of the United States–Ecuador quarter-final of the Copa América Centenario. He also called the USMNT games on Fox with John Strong and Stuart Holden and then teamed up with ESPN/ABC&#x27;s lead play-by-play announcer Ian Darke for the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024.

=== San Diego Loyal (ownership and leadership) ===
Donovan, along with Warren Smith, a co-founder of Sacramento Republic, founded a USL Championship expansion team in June 2019. The team debuted in the USL Championship in 2020. Warren Smith will be the president, while Donovan will be the executive vice president of soccer operations and head coach of the new club. Provisionally named USL San Diego, the team&#x27;s name and crest would be developed through fan engagement and reflect the interests of the city. On November 2, 2019, the team announced their branding and naming themselves San Diego Loyal.

=== Lincoln City ===
On 17 June 2021, it was announced that Donovan would be joining Lincoln City as a Strategic Advisor, working with the Board, Chief Executive Liam Scully and Director of Football Jez George to enhance the club&#x27;s network and relationships, particularly within North America.

==Personal life==
Donovan married actress Bianca Kajlich on December 31, 2006; the couple separated in July 2009, and Donovan filed for divorce in December 2010. In May 2015, he married Hannah Bartell. They welcomed their first child, son Talon, in January 2016. Donovan has spoken publicly about dealing with depression throughout his life and career, and has criticized the professional sports world for its approach to mental health issues.

Since joining the Galaxy, Donovan has resided in Manhattan Beach, California. He speaks fluent Spanish, which he learned both in school and through playing in Hispanic clubs and leagues while growing up in California. He also speaks German as a result of his time spent in Germany. After his two brief stints playing for Everton in which he became a fan favorite, Donovan declared himself an &quot;Evertonian for life&quot;.

He was featured on the American cover of &quot;FIFA Football 2003&quot;, the North American covers of &quot;FIFA 07&quot;, &quot;FIFA 11&quot; and &quot;FIFA 12&quot; video games.

In 2016, Donovan became a part owner of Welsh football club Swansea City, joining several other Americans in an investment group that has a majority stake in the club.

Donovan revealed during the 2018 FIFA World Cup that he was a fan of fierce rival Mexico in the absence of the United States national team, having been sponsored to do so by Wells Fargo. He was widely criticized, including by his former international teammate Carlos Bocanegra, who Donovan responded back that he should &quot;remember where you came from&quot; in reference to Bocanegra&#x27;s Mexican heritage.

<text>Daisy Duke is a fictional character, played by Catherine Bach, from the American television series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. She is the cousin of Bo and Luke, the third main protagonists of the show, and the three live on a farm on the outskirts of Hazzard County with their Uncle Jesse.

Although never mentioned in the series itself, some press material for the show suggests that Daisy&#x27;s parents, along with Bo and Luke&#x27;s, were killed in a car accident; in the 1997 reunion movie, Daisy says her mother died when she was a baby. The series never explained how they all came to live with Uncle Jesse.

Daisy frequently becomes involved in the Dukes&#x27; car chases, originally in her Plymouth Road Runner or, from the mid-second season onwards and more famously, in her Jeep. Daisy also works as a waitress at the Boar&#x27;s Nest, the local tavern owned by Boss Hogg that was the main meeting place in Hazzard. She also aspires to be both a singer-songwriter and a journalist.

== Character ==

Daisy Duke is a well-meaning though rather naive, often scantily dressed rogue Southern belle. As with her cousins Bo and Luke Duke, Daisy has a habit of landing herself/her family in trouble. Despite being naive, Daisy is a very outgoing person and can be quite feisty on occasion. She always believes in doing the right thing and helping others in need. In season one Daisy is shown to be a good driver, but by the start of the second season, she isn&#x27;t as good of a driver as she was originally implied to be, often being run off the road. Daisy frequently finds herself caught up in the ongoing war between Boss Hogg and her family, the Duke clan. Her job at Boss&#x27;s tavern gives her the opportunity to eavesdrop on private conversations between Boss, Sheriff Rosco and various cohorts, often discovering important information that she can pass on to Uncle Jesse and the Duke boys. Her continued employment at the Boar&#x27;s Nest in spite of her obvious loyalty to her family is a sign of her status and popularity in Hazzard County, and a corresponding lack of intelligence on Boss Hogg&#x27;s part. Boss does in fact fire her on a few occasions, but by various story twists, always ends up re-hiring her by the end of the episode.

As with her cousins, Daisy never finds a long-lasting beau of her own over the course of the series, though Deputy Enos Strate has a long-running crush on her that spans the life of the series. This crush is largely unrequited, although Daisy is aware of it and often displays genuine care and concern for the likeable Enos. In the penultimate episode of the show&#x27;s run, &quot;Enos and Daisy&#x27;s Wedding,&quot; the pair plan to hastily get married as a way to avoid Daisy having to testify against Enos, though the situation is eventually resolved before the wedding takes place. In his recurring appearances during the show (typically once per season), Boss Hogg&#x27;s nephew Hughie also displays a romantic interest in Daisy (he actually feels no genuine respect or affection for her, however; he merely harbors a selfish lust for her beauty), although Daisy loathes the idea, and there is occasionally a vague hint of a possible previous romantic falling-out between the pair. The fourth season opening episode, &quot;Mrs. Daisy Hogg,&quot; sees Daisy falling in love and planning to marry another one of Boss&#x27;s nephews, Jaimie Lee Hogg (the character&#x27;s only appearance in the series), although before the wedding she realises he is a villain and the marriage is called off. Similarly, in the second-season episode &quot;Duke of Duke,&quot; Daisy becomes attracted to a visiting English Duke claiming to be a distant relation of the Duke clan; she eventually finds out he is a con man and again the romance is over.

In the 1997 reunion movie, she is said to have left Hazzard to get married at some point after the original series, but is subsequently divorced. After her marriage ended, she was pursuing a graduate degree at Duke University, and upon her return to Hazzard agrees to marry Enos Strate, who reveals he had been writing weekly love letters to Daisy for many years (tying into Enos&#x27;s own spin-off series), but backs out at the last minute due to both the sudden reappearance of her ex-husband, and for fear of another debacle like her first marriage.

== Vehicles ==
Daisy&#x27;s first car in the series is a yellow 1974 Plymouth Road Runner with a black stripe along the sides and over the roof. Although the car was intended to be a Plymouth Road Runner, later appearances in the second season used a 1971 Plymouth Satellite with a matching &quot;Road Runner&quot; stripe running along the sides and over the roof. The car meets its demise when the accelerator sticks while Bo and Luke are driving it during a chase in the second-season episode &quot;The Runaway,&quot; sending it over a cliff. Because the episodes were broadcast in a different order to that in which they were filmed, the Plymouth makes several reappearances after its supposed destruction (additionally, after the Plymouth has been destroyed on-screen, several models of the car appear in various episodes with different paint jobs, serving as other vehicles within the context of the stories) until &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard II: Daisy Dukes It Out&quot;.

After losing that car, at the end of &quot;The Runaway&quot; she receives her trademark white 1980 Jeep CJ-7 &quot;Golden Eagle,&quot; named &quot;Dixie&quot;. The initial version of the Jeep seen at the end of this episode is noticeably different from what soon becomes the standard version, with a slightly different paint job, doors with &quot;Dixie&quot; painted on, and &quot;Golden Eagle&quot; printed on the hood on either side of an eagle emblem. After this and its second appearance, in the episode &quot;Arrest Jesse Duke&quot; (produced after &quot;The Runaway&quot; but actually broadcast before, creating a continuity error), bar a couple of stock footage shots of the Jeep parked outside of the Duke farm where the initial design can be seen, the design changes to a lighter paint job, no doors, and &quot;Dixie&quot; painted alongside the emblem on the hood. However, as with other vehicles in the show, there are different versions of the Jeep used for filming of various episodes. Sometimes the Jeep has a slightly different paint scheme, and alternates between automatic and manual transmissions. The design of the roll-bars also varies slightly across the seasons.

On a number of occasions Daisy also drives Uncle Jesse&#x27;s pickup truck, and certain storylines occasionally call for her to drive the General Lee.

== Appearance ==
Daisy Duke is both the main female protagonist and the sex symbol on &quot;Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. In two episodes Daisy wears a red bikini to distract Cletus and a truck driver. She appears numerous times wearing short, tight denim shorts, which later became colloquially known as &quot;Daisy Dukes&quot;.

The network censors believed that Daisy&#x27;s famous denim cut-off shorts alone would be too revealing. The shorts were so short that the only way the producers could get them on air was for Catherine Bach to wear flesh-colored pantyhose with them to ensure that the shorts revealed no more of her than intended. Bach herself had concerns about the shorts, saying she could not wear them in a restaurant scene in the show. The producers suggested that Bach go and see what the girls were wearing in the restaurant across the street; she found the waitresses there were wearing &quot;little miniskirts that matched the tablecloths!&quot; Bach made many of Daisy&#x27;s costumes herself, especially the early ones, including the red bikini in the first episode, which is seen during the show&#x27;s opening credits.

At the suggestion of the show&#x27;s producers, Bach posed as Daisy Duke for a poster, which sold 5 million copies. The poster created unexpected admiration from Nancy Reagan and other staff after Bach visited, then sent a copy to one of her former schoolteachers employed in the White House.

== In film ==

=== 2005 version ===
In the 2005 feature film &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, Daisy Duke is portrayed by Jessica Simpson. Film critics commended Simpson on her performance, but claimed that her portrayal had little in common with the character Catherine Bach created, and that she was merely cast because of her celebrity status.

Daisy&#x27;s costume was slightly modified for the film to make her more overtly sexual: her Daisy Dukes were shorter than they had been on the series, and her shirts showed much more cleavage than Bach&#x27;s ever had. She also did not wear pantyhose under her shorts, going bare-legged in the film. Another difference in her appearance was that Simpson&#x27;s hair remained blonde, whereas Bach&#x27;s was brunette. Simpson did, however, wear a brunette wig as a disguise during the film, and her hair was a darker blonde in the music video for &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;.

=== 2007 film ===

In the 2007 film &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning&quot;, Daisy starts out as an innocent Bible school girl and does not dress particularly attractively. She wears large flannel shirts, jeans, big glasses, and her hair in a bun. To get a job as a waitress at the Boar&#x27;s Nest and to attract Hughie Hogg (Boss&#x27;s nephew), she decides to change her look. She goes through several outfits before finally settling on her signature look. She is also a brunette in this movie. Daisy is played by April Scott.

<text>The 1997 Miami tornado (also known as the Great Miami Tornado) was an F1 tornado which touched down in Miami, Florida, on May 12, 1997. The tornado was captured by an elevated camera operated by the local television station WPLG.

==Tornado summary==
The tornado formed at 1:53 p.m. EDT, initially touching down in the Silver Bluff Estates area. It then swept through Downtown Miami bypassing the city&#x27;s skyscrapers. It crossed the MacArthur Causeway and the Venetian Causeway towards Miami Beach, sideswiping the cruise ship MS &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot;. The tornado lifted from the water halfway through Biscayne Bay and touched down briefly again in Miami Beach, flipping over a car and then dissipating. The Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma had noted the possibility for tornadoes in the area and warned that there might be more to come. The tornado ultimately caused 12 injuries and $525,000 in damage, though no injuries were serious. The tornado&#x27;s passage also cut power to 21,000 people.

<doc id="566108" wikidata="Q49292" url="?curid=566108" title="Madge Syers">
<text>Florence Madeline &quot;Madge&quot; Syers (&quot;née&quot; Cave, 16 September 1881 – 9 September 1917) was a British figure skater. She became the first woman to compete at the World Figure Skating Championships in 1902 by entering what was previously an all-male event and won the silver medal, which prompted the International Skating Union (ISU) to create a separate ladies&#x27; championship. Syers was the winner of the first two ladies&#x27; events in 1906 and 1907 and went on to become the Olympic champion at the 1908 Olympics, the first Olympic Games to include figure skating. She also competed as a pairs skater with her husband Edgar Syers, winning the bronze medal at the 1908 Olympics.

==Personal life==
Florence Madeline Cave was born on 16 September 1881 in Kensington, London, one of 15 children of Edward Jarvis Cave, a builder, and his wife Elizabeth Ann. She was a proficient figure skater, as well as a gifted swimmer and equestrienne. Madge became a regular at the Prince&#x27;s Skating Club in Knightsbridge, which had been formed in 1896 and was popular with aristocratic society in London.

In 1899, Madge met her future husband Edgar Syers, a figure skater and coach who was 18 years her senior. Edgar was an exponent of the international skating style, which was freer and less rigid than the traditional English style, and encouraged Madge to adopt this style. Madge and Edgar competed together in pairs skating events, and in 1900 finished second in one of the first international pairs events, staged in Berlin. They married in June of that year. The Syers&#x27; co-authored &quot;The Book of Winter Sports&quot; in 1908.

==Career==
===1902 World championships===
The World Figure Skating Championships, first contested in 1896, was regarded as an all-male event since competitive skating was generally viewed as a male activity, but there was no regulation barring women, enabling Syers to enter and compete at the 1902 Championships in London. She won the silver medal behind Ulrich Salchow, who was reputedly so impressed with her challenge that he offered her his gold medal. T. D. Richardson later wrote: &quot;Rumour, nay more than rumour – a good deal of expert opinion – thought she should have won.&quot;

Syers&#x27; entry into the World Championships prompted the ISU to discuss the subject of women competing against men at their next Congress in 1903. The concerns raised were that &quot;(1) the dress prevents the judges from seeing the feet; (2) a judge might judge a girl to whom he was attached; and (3) it is difficult to compare women with men.&quot; To address the concerns of the ISU, Syers started the trend of wearing calf-length skirts so judges could see her foot work. The Congress voted six to three in favour of barring women from the championships.

===1903–1907===
Syers continued to compete elsewhere and, in 1903, won the inaugural British Figure Skating Championships, which began as a mixed competition. She won again the following year, beating her husband, who won the silver medal. She also entered the 1904 European Championships but withdrew due to injury after the first stage of the competition, the compulsory figures.

The 1905 ISU Congress established a separate ladies&#x27; event, which was supported by strong lobbying from the National Ice Skating Association. The event was known at the time as the Ladies&#x27; Championship of the ISU rather than a World Championship, and was staged at a different date and location from the men&#x27;s event. Syers won the inaugural event held in Davos, Switzerland in 1906, finishing first in a field of five competitors. She won her second title in Vienna at the 1907 Championships.

===1908 Olympics===

The 1908 Summer Olympics in London were the first Games to include figure skating events in the programme, which were staged in October at the Prince&#x27;s Club. Syers entered both the ladies&#x27; event and the pairs with Edgar. In the ladies&#x27; event, Syers comfortably won the compulsory figures section, with all five judges placing her first. The official report of the Games described her as &quot;in a class by herself&quot; and stated that &quot;the wonderful accuracy of her figures, combined with perfect carriage and movement, was the chief feature of the morning&#x27;s skating.&quot; In the free skating, the report described her as having &quot;excelled in rhythm and time-keeping, and her dance steps, pirouettes, &amp;c., were skated without a fault.&quot; She was again placed first by all five judges and won the title. In the pairs event, Syers and Edgar finished third (of three couples) and won the bronze medal.

==Later life==
Syers retired from competitive skating after the Olympics due to fading health. She and Edgar co-authored a second book together, &quot;The Art of Skating (International Style)&quot;, published in 1913. She died of heart failure caused by acute endocarditis on 9 September 1917 at her home in Weybridge, Surrey, seven days shy of her 36th birthday.

Syers was elected to the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1981.
