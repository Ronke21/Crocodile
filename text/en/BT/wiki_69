<text>Triple M is an Australian commercial radio network owned and operated by Southern Cross Austereo. The network consists of 45 radio stations with flagship stations broadcasting a mainstream/classic rock music format in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, 37 regional stations broadcasting a modern adult contemporary/adult hits format and 5 digital radio stations.

The network dates back to the launch of Triple M Sydney in 1980. On 15 December 2016, the network was amalgamated with the LocalWorks network of regional radio stations.

==History==

The first Triple M station was Triple M Sydney, which commenced broadcasting to Sydney on 2 August 1980. Triple M Sydney and then-rival 2Day FM were the first commercial FM radio stations in Sydney. Throughout the 1980s, Triple M was one of the highest-rating radio stations in Sydney, spearheaded by its morning show presented by Doug Mulray and featuring the writing of and occasional appearances by Andrew Denton. For all of this period and into the 1990s, Triple M&#x27;s promotional campaign featured the character &quot;Dr Dan&quot;, a guitar-playing satyr with wings, inspired by artwork by legendary Australian cartoonist Peter Ledger, and a theme song that was an extended reworking of the Mike Batt track &quot;Introduction (The Journey of a Fool)&quot;, from his 1979 album Tarot Suite.

In 1988, Melbourne radio station EON FM (3EON), 92.3 was taken over by Triple M and changed its callsign to Triple M and moved to 105.1 MHz in November 1988. EON FM was Australia&#x27;s first commercial FM radio station, commencing broadcasting on 11 July 1980.

Brisbane radio station Triple M Brisbane was launched in 1980 and took on the FM104 identity soon after. It returned to the Triple M identity in early 1990. Its callsign has remained 4MMM since its 1980 launch. Triple M Brisbane started broadcasting on 104.1FM, then late in the 1980s changed to its present frequency of 104.5-FM.

Adelaide radio station 5KA converted from 1197 kHz to 104.7 MHz on 1 January 1990 and was renamed KAFM (5KKA). The station was taken over by Village Roadshow, who then owned Triple M, and they successfully negotiated the purchase of the 5MMM callsign from a community radio station in 1993. That station is now known as Three D Radio (5DDD), and the 5MMM callsign is now used by Triple M Adelaide (104.7).

Perth radio station 96FM (6NOW) also carried the Triple M identity and 6MMM callsign in the early 1990s but was then sold to Southern Cross Broadcasting who changed the station&#x27;s identity back to its original name. Mix 94.5 until December 2020 was &quot;considered&quot; to be a part of the Triple M network in Perth utilising local programming (as opposed to airing networked Triple M programmes) and Mix 94.5 didn’t carry the Triple M brand, logo or call letters.

In Auckland, New Zealand, a Triple M station existed between 1984 and 1988 when 89 Stereo FM became part of Triple M. The station previously used the call sign 1ROQ and changed to 1MMM when becoming part of Triple M. New Zealand no longer uses radio station call signs. This station later reverted to 89FM in 1988 and eventually closed down in 1994.

While many of the comedy and talk programs are networked, large sections of music programming originate from the local market of each Triple M.

On Friday 17 November 2006, Triple M (including Mix 94.5 in Perth) referred to itself as U2FM for the day, as part of a promotion relating to the band U2 and their 2006 Australian Tour and CD release.

Triple M launched High Voltage Radio, a &quot;pop up&quot; digital radio station that exclusively played AC/DC for the duration of the band&#x27;s 2010 tour of Australia.

On 16 August 2013, Triple M Perth was launched on digital radio, returning the station to Perth. Branded as &quot;Perth&#x27;s Real Music Alternative&quot;, the station also carried Triple M AFL coverage. On 27 September 2014, the station was replaced by Triple M Modern Rock Digital. Featuring only new rock music, the station also expanded to Adelaide.

On 25 November 2013, Triple M Classic Rock Digital radio station was launched. The station format is exclusively classic rock, with no announcer talkback.

On 1 December 2020, the Triple M brand was relaunched in Perth, replacing contemporary hit radio station Hit 92.9 after sister station Mix 94.5 switched affiliation to the Hit Network.

In September 2002, Triple M and Frontier Touring held four rock concerts in Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney as part of the touring M-One festival, which featured Goo Goo Dolls, Nickelback, Garbage, Lifehouse, Default, Midnight Oil and Antiskeptic.

===Essential Countdown===

In 2004, the national network counted down the Triple M Essential 2005 Songs from Boxing Day to Australia Day. The number one song was Violent Femmes&#x27; &quot;Blister in the Sun&quot;.

Triple M have held an Essential Countdown based on listener votes since 2006, beginning in October of each year, counting the same number of songs as the year (e.g., 2006 songs in 2006). The countdown has received some criticism for being overly similar to the Triple J Hottest 100 countdown, despite the Triple J Hottest 100 only including songs from the preceding 12 months.

==Personal life==

Rajesh Roshan was born to Indian Punjabi music director Roshan and Indian Bengali singer Ira Roshan. He is the brother of Indian film producer and director Rakesh Roshan and uncle of actor Hrithik Roshan.

He is married to Kanchan Roshan and the couple have two children, a son, Eshaan Roshan, and a daughter, actress Pashmina Roshan.

He shot to fame with the score for the 1974 film &quot;Kunwara Baap&quot; and the 1975 film &quot;Julie&quot;; for the latter he won the Filmfare Best Music Director Award. 

Rajesh Roshan scored for &quot;Kunwara Baap&quot; (1974) and then in three back-to-back hit films: &quot;Des Pardes&quot;, &quot;Man Pasand&quot;, &quot;Lootmaar&quot;. He went on to compose melodious tunes and made Kishore Kumar sing them in films like &quot;Mama Bhanja&quot;, &quot;Doosra Aadmi&quot;, &quot;Swami&quot;, &quot;Priyatama&quot;, &quot;Yehi Hai Zindagi&quot;, &quot;Ek Hi Raasta&quot;, &quot;Swarag Narak&quot;, &quot;Inkaar&quot;, &quot;Khatta Meetha&quot;, &quot;Baton Baton Mein&quot;, &quot;Do Aur Do Paanch&quot;, &quot;Kaamchor&quot;, &quot;Hamari Bahu Alka&quot;, &quot;Jaag Utha Insan&quot;, &quot;Bhagwaan Dada&quot;, &quot;Ghar Sansar&quot; followed by films with Rajesh Khanna like &quot;Janta Hawaldar&quot;, &quot;Nishaan&quot;, &quot;Babu&quot; and &quot;Aakhir Kyon?&quot;.

In the 1990s, he worked in albums like &quot;Karan Arjun&quot; (1995), &quot;Sabse Bada Khiladi&quot; (1995), &quot;Papa Kehte Hai&quot; (1996), &quot;Koyla&quot; (1997), Keemat – They Are Back, &quot;&quot; (1999), &quot;Dastak&quot; (1996), &quot;Kya Kehna&quot; (2000) and &quot;Kaho Naa...

== Controversies ==

=== Plagiarism ===
Rajesh Roshan has often been accused of plagiarism; journalist Karan Thapar talks of at least 39 &quot;copied tunes&quot;. Indian music critic Karthik Srinivasan, on his website &quot;ItwoFS&quot;, which tracks plagiarism in the Indian film music industry, lists 41 such tunes. These include some of Roshan&#x27;s best-known titles, such as &quot;Jab Koi Baat Bigad Jaye&quot; (&quot;Jurm&quot;, 1990) being inspired by &quot;Hear The Whistle Blow A Hundred Miles&quot; from Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs (released in 1967) and &quot;Aye Dil Laya Hai Bahaar&quot; (&quot;Kya Kehna&quot;, 2000) inspired by Neil Sedaka&#x27;s 1959 hit single &quot;Oh! Carol&quot;.

In 2008, the Bombay High Court obligated the Roshan brothers to pay up to Rs 2 crore to music composer Ram Sampath following his accusations of their movie &quot;Krazzy 4&quot;, produced by Rakesh and having Rajesh as music director, containing Sampath&#x27;s plagiarized music score.

He composed music for their hit films like &quot;Pandu Havaldar&quot; (1975), &quot;Maine Pyar Kiya&quot; (1989), &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994), &quot;Hum Saath Saath Hain&quot; (1999), &quot;Muskurahat&quot; (1992), &quot;Police Public&quot; (1990), &quot;100 Days&quot; (1991). His first film was &quot;Agent Vinod&quot; (1977)

==Early life and training==

Laxman (Patil) took his initial music lessons from his father and uncle. He later studied music at the Bhatkhande Shikshan Sansthan. Raamlaxman started his own orchestra named Amar-Vijay (Amar was his son&#x27;s name).

==Career==
The famous comedian, Dada Kondke was impressed by him and approached him to compose the music for his Marathi comedy &quot;Pandu Havaldar&quot;. Vijay, with his friend Raam, composed the music that went on to become a raging hit, and their alliance with Kondke did not break until the latter&#x27;s death. Later, he did films with Manmohan Desai, Mahesh Bhatt, G.P.Sippy, Anil Ganguly and others. His favourite singers were Shailendra Singh and Usha Mangeshkar, while his favourite lyricist was Asad Bhopali. His releases were mostly with Ravindra Rawal. Although he frequently collaborated with Lata Mangeshkar and produced some of the biggest hits in his career.

In 1981, Raamlaxman collaborated with Ravindra Rawal for movie &quot;Hum Se Badhkar Kaun&quot;. Song &quot;Deva O Deva Ganpati Deva&quot; got famous during that period. He has also given music for movies &quot;Hum Se Hai Zamana&quot; (1983), &quot;Woh Jo Hasina&quot; (1983), &quot;Deewana Tere Naam Ka&quot; (1987) and &quot;Aage Ki Soch&quot; (1988).
Raamlaxman is the &quot;Laxman&quot; of duo composers &quot;Raam-Laxman&quot;. In 1976, &quot;Raam&quot; (his partner &quot;Surendra&quot;) died immediately after signing the film &quot;Agent Vinod&quot; (1977). Laxman continued to retain Raam&#x27;s name in Marathi as well as Hindi films. 

In the year 1988, Raamlaxman got a major break with Sooraj Barjatya&#x27;s &quot;Maine Pyar Kiya&quot; (1989). His composition earned him filmfare award for Best Music Director. The film set a record at its time for the most Filmfare awards won by a single film with seven, from thirteen nominations. It was also the first film to win the three major awards in the music category (Best Music Director, Male Playback Singer, Best Lyricist). The film also launched S. P. Balasubrahmanyam as voice of new actor Salman Khan from period 1989 to 1994.

Laxman scored a major hit once again with superhit film &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994). His collaboration with Sooraj Barjatya went on and he gave good hits in the film &quot;Hum Saath Saath Hain&quot; (1999).
He died at his residence in Nagpur on 22 May 2021, due to COVID-related complications and cardiac arrest, at the age of 78.

<text>Plestiodon callicephalus, commonly known as the mountain skink, is a species of lizard, a medium-sized member of the &quot;Plestiodon&quot; skinks, endemic to North America.

==Taxonomy==
At least one herpetologist has considered this species to be a subspecies of &quot;Plestiodon tetragrammus&quot; under the scientific name &quot;P. tetragrammus callicephalus&quot;, but the more common classification considers it to be a separate species based on differences in appearance and its distinct geographic distribution.

==Description==
The mountain skink is a medium-sized skink reaching a maximum length from snout to vent of about . Its body is olive to brown in color, with black stripes on the sides. On the head, it features a distinctive, roughly Y-shaped light line pattern, which gave rise to its scientific name: &quot;callicephalus&quot; is Greek and means &quot;beautiful head&quot;.

Like many other &quot;Plestiodon&quot;, juvenile mountain skinks have a bright blue tail. However, contrary to most other species of this genus, adults retain this color, although it does fade a little with age.

==Geographic range==
The mountain skink occurs from southeastern Arizona and extreme southwestern
New Mexico southward to Nayarit and Jalisco in Mexico.

In the U.S., the species is very localized. In New Mexico, mountain skinks are found only in the southern Peloncillo Mountains (Hidalgo County) of southwest Hidalgo County. It is known only from Geronimo Trail and Guadalupe Canyon, where it is uncommon in its limited habitat. In Arizona, the mountain skink occurs in the Coronado National Forest.

==Conservation status==
Throughout its range in Mexico, the species seems secure, although many local populations may be jeopardized by habitat loss.

In New Mexico, the species is classified as &quot;critically impaired&quot;.

==Habitat==
The mountain skink is found in a wide variety of habitat, ranging from sea level to nearly 2,000 m (about 6,560 ft). It prefers areas with abundant and well-rotted leaf litter, providing cover and places for laying eggs.

==Behavior==
&quot;Plestiodon callicephalus&quot; is a terrestrial skink, spending most of its time foraging on the ground, hunting for small invertebrates. It is a good burrower, burrowing its own den.

<doc id="577609" wikidata="Q208561" url="?curid=577609" title="Olive baboon">
<text>The olive baboon (Papio anubis), also called the Anubis baboon, is a member of the family Cercopithecidae Old World monkeys. The species is the most wide-ranging of all baboons, being native to 25 countries throughout Africa, extending from Mali eastward to Ethiopia and Tanzania. Isolated populations are also present in some mountainous regions of the Sahara. It inhabits savannahs, steppes, and forests. The common name is derived from its coat colour, which is a shade of green-grey at a distance. A variety of communications, vocal and non-vocal, facilitate a complex social structure.

==Characteristics==

The olive baboon is named for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. At closer range, its coat is multicoloured, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon&#x27;s face is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back.

Besides the mane, the male olive baboon differs from the female in terms of weight, body and canine tooth size; males are, on average, tall while standing and females measure in height. The olive baboon is one of the largest species of monkey; only the chacma baboon and the mandrill attain similar sizes. The head-and-body length can range from , with a species average of around . At the shoulder on all fours, females average against males, which average . The typical weight range for both sexes is reportedly , with males averaging and females averaging . Some males may weigh as much as .

Like other baboons, the olive baboon has an elongated, dog-like muzzle. Its long tail and four-legged gait can make it seem canine. The tail almost looks as if it is broken, as it is erect for the first quarter, after which it drops down sharply. The bare patch of a baboon&#x27;s rump is smaller in the olive baboon than in the Hamadryas baboon or Guinea baboon. The olive baboon, like most cercopithecines, has a cheek pouch with which to store food.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species inhabits a strip of 25 equatorial African countries, very nearly ranging from the east to west coasts of the continent. The exact boundaries of this strip are not clearly defined, as the species&#x27; territory overlaps with that of other baboon species. In many places, this has resulted in cross-breeding between species. For example, considerable hybridisation has occurred between the olive baboon and the hamadryas baboon in Ethiopia. Cross-breeding with the yellow baboon and the Guinea baboon has also been observed. Although this has been noted, the hybrids have not as yet been well studied.

Throughout its wide range, the olive baboon can be found in a number of different habitats. It is usually classified as savannah-dwelling, living in the wide plains of the grasslands. The grasslands, especially those near open woodland, do make up a large part of its habitat, but the baboon also inhabits rainforests and deserts. Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, both support olive baboon populations in dense tropical forests.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Social structure===
The olive baboon lives in groups of 15 to 150, made up of a few males, many females, and their young. Each baboon has a social ranking somewhere in the group, depending on its dominance. Female dominance is hereditary, with daughters having nearly the same rank as their mothers, and adult females forming the core of the social system. Female relatives form their own subgroups in the troop. Related females are largely friendly to each other. They tend to stay close together and groom one another, and team up in aggressive encounters within the troop. Female kin form these strong bonds because they do not emigrate from their natal groups.

Occasionally, groups may split up when they become so large that competition for resources is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. These high-ranking females also appear to have a higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to stress on the high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial. A recent study shows top-ranking females are at risk from male harassment. Males who have recently immigrated harass females in order to induce miscarriages in females they had not yet mated with, in order to impregnate them with an offspring that is his own faster. As females with living infants often have male allies protecting their infants, it makes more sense for a male to ignore infants and channel his aggression to the group&#x27;s resident pregnant females who do not currently have infants instead.
A female often forms a long-lasting social relationship with a male in her troop, known as a &quot;friendship&quot;. These nonsexual affiliative friendships benefit both the male and female. Males benefit from these relationships because they are usually formed soon after he immigrates into a new group, and helps the male integrate into the group more easily. He could also potentially end up mating with his female friend in the future. Females gain protection from threats to themselves and their infants (if they have any). Males occasionally &quot;baby-sit&quot; for their female friends, so she can feed and forage freely without the burden of having to carry or watch the infant. Sexually receptive females and newly immigrated males can form such friendships. These relationships are sometimes enduring and the pair grooms and remains close to each other. They also travel, forage, sleep, and raise infants together, as well as fight together against aggressive conspecifics.

Females with high social ranks even forge friendships with multiple males at once. Another advantage of these friendships is it enables females to gain protection from the unwanted advances of males aiming to mate with them. A female who finds a male undesirable can simply rebuff his advances by calling on her male friends to chase him away, and can therefore enjoy exerting her reproductive skew. While infanticide is a reproductive strategy in males, it is costly for females, which would also explain why infanticide is a rare occurrence in olive baboons yet can be the principal cause of infant mortality in many other baboon subspecies: high-ranking females can simply rebuff a male threatening her infant, making infant-targeted aggression a reproductive disadvantage in olive baboons. This also explains the reason male olive baboons use infants as shields in aggressive encounters.

Males establish their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive with each other and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bully and harass them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.

Despite being hierarchical, baboons appear to be &quot;democratic&quot; when it comes to deciding the direction of collective movement. Individuals are more likely to follow when multiple decision-makers agree on what direction to go rather than simply following dominant individuals.

===Reproduction and parenting===

Females are sexually mature at seven to eight years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The beginning of a female&#x27;s ovulation is a signal to the males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female&#x27;s anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female&#x27;s chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring have a better chance of surviving. These females also attract more males, and are more likely to cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female&#x27;s offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.
Newborns have black natal coats and bright pink skin. Females are the primary caregivers of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant may be unable to stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. Its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother&#x27;s fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. This difference lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant&#x27;s life. Olive baboons do not seem to practise co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another&#x27;s young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as they are likely to be related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. Adult males exploit infants and often use them as shields to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.

===Communication===

Olive baboons communicate with various vocalizations and facial expressions. Throughout the day, baboons of all ages emit the &quot;basic grunt&quot;. Adults give a range of calls. The &quot;roargrunt&quot; is made by adult males displaying to each other. The &quot;cough-bark&quot;, and the &quot;cough geck&quot; are made when low-flying birds or humans they do not know are sighted. A &quot;wa-hoo&quot; call is made in response to predators or neighbouring groups at night and during stressful situations. Other vocalizations include &quot;broken grunting&quot; (low-volume, quick series of grunts made during relatively calm aggressive encounters), &quot;pant-grunts&quot; (made when aggressive encounters escalate), &quot;shrill barks&quot; (loud calls given when potential threats appear suddenly), and &quot;screams&quot; (continuous high-pitch sounds responding to strong emotions). The most common facial expression of the olive baboon is &quot;lipsmacking&quot;, which is associated with a number of behaviours. &quot;Ear flattening&quot;, &quot;eyes narrowed&quot;, &quot;head shaking&quot;, &quot;jaw-clapping&quot;, lipsmacking, and &quot;tongue protrusion&quot; are used when baboons are greeting each other, and are sometimes made with a &quot;rear present&quot;. &quot;Eyebrow raising&quot;, &quot;molar grinding&quot;, &quot;staring&quot;, and &quot;yawning&quot; are used to threaten other baboons. A submissive baboon responds with displays such as the &quot;fear grin&quot;, the &quot;rigid crouch&quot;, and &quot;tail erect&quot;.

===Diet===
One major reason for its widespread success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous and like other baboons, will eat practically anything. As such, it is able to find nutrition in almost any environment and is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.

The diet typically includes a large variety of plants, and invertebrates and small mammals, as well as birds. The olive baboon eats leaves, grass, roots, bark, flowers, fruit, lichens, tubers, seeds, mushrooms, corms, and rhizomes. Corms and rhizomes are especially important in times of drought, because grass loses a great deal of its nutritional value. In dry, arid regions, such as the northeastern deserts, small invertebrates like insects, grubs, worms, spiders, and scorpions fill out its diet.

The olive baboon also actively hunts prey, such as small rodents, birds and other primates. Its limit is usually small antelope, such as Thomson&#x27;s gazelle, but will also kill sheep, goats, and chickens from farms, which may amount to around one third of its food from hunting. Hunting is usually a group activity, with both males and females participating. This systematic predation was apparently developed recently. In a field study, such behaviour was observed as starting with the males of one troop and spreading through all ages and sexes.

In Eritrea, the olive baboon has formed a symbiotic relationship with that country&#x27;s endangered elephant population. The baboons use the water holes dug by the elephants, while the elephants use the tree-top baboons as an early warning system.

==Conservation status==
The olive baboon is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List because it is widespread with a large global population and not threatened by a range-wide population decline. Competition and disease have possibly led to fewer baboons in closed forests. Like most other baboon species, it is routinely exterminated as a pest for crop raiding and small livestock predation.

<text>The Zanzibar red colobus (Piliocolobus kirkii) is a species of red colobus monkey endemic to Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago, off the coast of Tanzania. It is also known as Kirk&#x27;s red colobus after Sir John Kirk, the British Resident of Zanzibar who first brought it to the attention of zoological science. It is now classified as an endangered species and in the mid-1990s was adopted as the flagship species for conservation in Zanzibar. The population is still decreasing, and conservationists are attempting to work with the local government to devise a proper, effective strategy to protect the population and habitat. Challenges include the species&#x27; habitat, which is limited to the archipelago. The species has been reclassified three times; it was previously in the genus &quot;Colobus&quot;, then in the genus &quot;Procolobus&quot;, and later in the genus &quot;Piliocolobus&quot;.

==Evolutionary history and taxonomy==

The Zanzibar red colobus, &quot;Piliocolobus kirkii&quot;, population on Zanzibar, represents a population of red colobus that is believed to have been isolated on the island after sea levels rose toward the end of the Pleistocene epoch. Furthermore, it is suggested through mitochondrial analysis, that phylogenetic groups within the red colobus have been genetically isolated from another since the Pliocene.

Examining cranial morphology has shown that &quot;P. kirkii&quot; has diverged from mainland &quot;Piliocolobus&quot; to its own species. It has experienced an acceleration in morphological evolution of size which is suggested to be the result of insularity on the island and environmental pressures such as competition, habitat, predation and/or resource availability. There has been no evidence for population bottlenecks in the species.

The smaller cranium of &quot;P. kirkii&quot; in contrast to the mainland colobus monkey, is consistent with Foster&#x27;s rule (also known as the island rule) in which the original (larger) animal becomes smaller over time when there are limited resources. Males tend to have pedomorphic traits which include a shorter face, large orbits and an enlarged neurocranium. It is not certain how long ago and where this evolutionary change occurred.

Through molecular analyses, it is indicated that &quot;P. kirkii&quot; is more closely related to the Udzungwa red colobus (&quot;P. gordonorum&quot;) compared to other red colobus species. This analysis has also placed the divergence of &quot;P. kirkii&quot; from its sister species &quot;P. godronorum&quot; at about 600,000 years ago, which actually allows for an older evolutionary age compared to the previous assumption that it had become its own species around the last glacial period. The species has been reclassified twice; it was previously in the genus &quot;Colobus&quot;, and more recently in the genus &quot;Procolobus&quot; and then the genus &quot;Piliocolobus&quot;.

An alternative common name is Kirk&#x27;s red colobus after Sir John Kirk (1832–1922), the British Resident of Zanzibar who first brought it to the attention of zoological science.

==Physical description==
This Old World monkey&#x27;s coat ranges from dark red to black, accented with a black stripe along the shoulders and arms, and a pale underside. Its black face is crowned with long, white hair, and features a distinguishing pink mark on its lips and nose. Also, the Zanzibar red colobus has a long tail used only for balancing—it is not prehensile. Sexual dimorphism is generally decreased in the species, meaning the females have little difference in their body size and colour from their male counterparts. Females usually outnumber the males in their groups. The species has a notably small cranium and rotund body shape, with males potentially reaching over and females, . In adults, highly differentiated facial features help them to distinguish each other in a group.

The word &quot;colobus&quot; comes from Greek &quot;ekolobóse&quot;, meaning &quot;he cut short&quot;, and is so named because of the significant reduction in size, or complete lack of an opposable thumb in comparison to other primates. To make up for this, they have four long digits that align to form a strong hook, allowing them to easily grasp branches and climb.

Locals on the island have called the Zanzibar red colobus &quot;kima punju&quot; which means &quot;poison monkey&quot; in Swahili because of their strong smell unlike other monkeys. This has caused people to hold negative views of the monkey and even to say it has an evil influence on trees on which they feed, ultimately killing the trees.

==Habitat==
The Zanzibar red colobus is found in three forests of the Zanzibar archipelago. It displays a wide habit tolerance, but it is mainly an arboreal species and prefers drier areas over wet ones. Its habitats include coastal thickets and coastal rag scrub, but it can also be found in agricultural areas and in mangrove swamps; the latter provides food year-round. When found in agricultural areas, the monkey is more used to humans and comes closer to the ground.

About 1,600 to 3,000 individuals remain, and currently, 50% of the monkeys found on the islands live outside protected zones. The largest and most significant area of protection and habitat for the monkey is in Jozani National Park, which provides of land reserve. It is located on the main island and the populations here have been greatly studied in regards to both their ecology and behavior. Even so, many groups have been found in &quot;shambas&quot; (Swahili for &quot;farmland&quot;) in close proximity to the park. In these &quot;shambas&quot; adjacent to the park, higher densities of the red colobus have been reported living here in more cohesive groups, compared to inside the park reserve. The incidence of some of these monkeys living permanently outside the zone of the protected park reserve can increase the endangerment of the groups.


==Behavior==

The groups consist of up to four adult males and many adult females; typically yielding a 1:2 ratio of males to females. Young of varying ages are also incorporated in the group. The number of monkeys in a group can range from 30 to 50 individuals. The species is a very social animal, and can often be observed playing and grooming during the rest periods between meals. Unlike females, in a group, males actually maintain close bonds, acting together in defense of their group and even in grooming each other.

===Feeding===
Feeding is also a group activity. It begins to feed in the morning, and is more active during the cooler parts of the day. Loud calls from males indicate the group is ready to move to another tree to feed. This monkey is mainly a foliovore, and on average, half of the leaves consumed are young leaves. They also eat leaf shoots, seeds, flowers, and unripe fruit. It has also been found eating bark, dead wood, and soil. It is one of the few species that do not eat ripe fruits; it has a sacculated stomach with four chambers specific for breaking down plant materials, however it cannot digest the sugars contained in mature fruits. Because the monkey feeds on young leaves (though not limited to them), there are instances where it consumes charcoal, which is believed to aid their digestion of the toxins (possibly phenolic compounds) found in the young leaves of the Indian almond tree and mango tree. The habit of consuming charcoal is thought to be a learned behavior presumably passed on from the mother to her offspring. The presence of charcoal deposits were shown to result in these monkeys being more likely to inhabit areas that had trees as a food source that were rich in phenolics. It has been noted, however, that not all populations on the islands carry out the behavior, but that it is rather mostly done by those who consume more perennial and exotic foliage.

Since some populations use mangroves as a source of food, it is natural for the monkey to consume more sodium chloride (NaCl). Because of this, those populations have been observed to drink water directly from tree-holes, or licking water off of leaves. This innovative behavior shows the adaptation of the monkey to novel ecological and environmental circumstances.

In the dry season, one of the staple foods, Indian almond tree, as previously mentioned, drops its leaves and can cause the monkey to go beyond park boundaries in order to extend its feeding range. This puts the already endangered colobine at more risk.

===Reproduction===

Males usually reach sexual maturity at about 3–3.5 years old, while females attain it at about two years old. Females approaching estrous can be easily identified because of the swelling and bright red coloration of the genital area. This signals to males that the given female is ready for mating. Moreover, just prior to mating, males will use their fingers to probe the female&#x27;s birth canal. This is immediately followed by sniffing the area because estrogen and progesterone can be detected by this method, further helping the male conclude if the female is indeed ready to breed.

Gestation is about six months for colobus monkeys; one female typically has about one or two new-born every two years. Parental care is intense and often, the role is shared by multiple females of the group. It is observed that about 76% of offspring are born between September and December. Infanticide has also been noted on occasion when a new male joins a given group that has infants.

Research has suggested that the ability for dietary expansion, which consuming charcoal partly allows, explains the higher birth rates and densities due to resource availability. Birth rates for those living in mangroves are higher than colobus monkeys living in coral rag forests.

There are higher birthing rates between October–December for colobines on Uzi Island and then January–February for those in Kiwengwa, located on the eastern side of the main island. Infant mortality can be significantly high with half of the infants born not reaching more than six months of age. The birth rates themselves, however, are actually decreased in comparison to mainland colobus monkeys and interbirth intervals are longer as well. Research has suggested that this is a consequence of disturbed habitats in which mainland colobi are not so affected.

===Communication===

The red colobus species have a smaller larynx compared to other members of the Colobinae subfamily. The male&#x27;s call is more of an alto or soprano in contrast to the low bass of a male&#x27;s in black-and-white colobus species. The Zanzibar red colobus is non-territorial in nature and as so does not typically make loud, territorial threat calls. Zanzibar red colobus distress and warning calls are the &quot;bark&quot;, &quot;chist&quot;, or &quot;wheet&quot;. One of the loudest calls from the monkey is heard when he expresses his dominance over the group and when checking the sexual status of his females.

The call heard most often by people in or near Jozani Forest is the &#x27;alerting signal&#x27;. This is an attention-getting call that is derived from the progression call. Chirps and grunts are made when there are changes in the surrounding environment such as changes in weather or animal movement in proximity to the group. With most arboreal animals, there are two different alerting calls, one for when a predator is on land, and another when there is an aerial predator. However, because of the lack of larger birds of prey in Zanzibar, such calls are not often witnessed. The young, on the other hand, because of their smaller size and vulnerability, do at times make such calls when they see shadows.

Because the Zanzibar red colobus is extremely social, it has a specific call for when it is alone for a certain amount of time upon which it feels vulnerable or threatened. The young are typically the ones to make such a call that sounds like a loud scream, but adults are occasionally likely (when deemed necessary) to make some variation of the call as well.

==Conservation==
A number of factors have contributed to the monkey&#x27;s endangered status. First, an increase in deforestation has resulted in a significant reduction in resources and habitat; second, it is hunted for meat and pet markets. To counteract the decline in population, various attempts have been made to protect the species. In 1974, specimens were moved to Ngezi Forest on Pemba Island to try to re-establish the monkey&#x27;s population. It had been found, however, that 20 years after the translocation to the island only one group of Zanzibar red colobus was found and with few sightings and interviews with locals, the population was estimated to be between 15 and 30 individuals. Researchers concluded that the group had certainly survived but did not increase in number possibly due to adverse relations with humans. Some locals in Pemba hold superstitions against the monkey because of the idea that it brings bad luck upon farmers. This may explain the reason that they have not significantly grown in population size.

On Uzi and Vundwe Islands, the Zanzibar red colobus is subject to extensive habitat destruction, particularly with coral rag forests. There is also reported poisoning, netting, and disappearance of monkeys as well as other with animals.

Various attempts have been made for conservation of the species. One project was with the World Wildlife Fund, specifically in Menai Bay which is located just west of Uzi Island. Another funded by the Wildlife Conservation Society designated the Zanzibar red colobus as the flagship species in a long-term study on population, human influence, and behaviour.

The African Convention has played a role in the conservation of the animal by categorizing it as &#x27;Class A.&#x27; According to the document &quot;African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources&quot;, &#x27;Class A&#x27; is described as:
species in Class A shall be totally protected throughout the entire territory of the Contracting States; the hunting, killing, capture or collection of specimens shall be permitted only on the authorization in each case of the highest competent authority and only if required in the national interest or for scientific purposes.

It has been suggested that an important way to promote conservation of the monkey is to simply spread awareness about it – that it is not a harmful animal and that it can actually be good for the region&#x27;s economy because it draws tourism. This has been the case on the island of Unguja (Zanzibar). Furthermore, it would be necessary to establish and designate protected zones.

<text>Hard Boiled () is a 1992 Hong Kong action thriller film directed by John Woo from a screenplay by Gordon Chan and Barry Wong based on a story written by Woo. The film stars Chow Yun-fat, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, and Anthony Wong. It follows a police inspector whose investigation of a brutal Triad leader entangles him in the complex world of undercover policing.

The film was John Woo&#x27;s last Hong Kong film before his transition to Hollywood. After receiving criticism for making films that glamorized gangsters, Woo wanted to make a &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;-styled film to glamorize the police. With the death of screenwriter Barry Wong, the film&#x27;s screenplay underwent constant changes during filming. New characters such as Mad Dog and Mr. Woo were introduced, while the original plotline of a baby-poisoning psychopath was cut.

&quot;Hard Boiled&quot; was released in Hong Kong in 1992 to generally positive audience reception. Though it was not as commercially successful as Woo&#x27;s &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;, it still did slightly better than &quot;The Killer&quot; in the domestic box office. Reception from Western critics was much more positive, with many critics and film scholars describing its action scenes as being among the best ever filmed. In 2007, a video game sequel titled &quot;Stranglehold&quot; was released.

== Plot ==
In a Hong Kong teahouse, Royal Hong Kong Police inspectors &quot;Tequila&quot; Yuen and Benny Mak surveil a group of gun smugglers while they are making a deal. When a rival gang ambushes the deal, a fierce shootout breaks out; the gangsters are defeated, but several police officers and civilians are wounded and Benny is killed. As revenge, Tequila executes the gangster who killed Benny rather than arrest him. He is reprimanded by Chief Superintendent Pang, who needed the executed gangster as a key witness. After a police funeral, Pang burns the personnel file of another smuggler Tequila killed, revealing him to be an undercover cop.

Meanwhile, Alan, an assassin working for Triad boss &quot;Uncle&quot; Hoi, murders one of Hoi&#x27;s subordinates who had double-crossed them for a rival syndicate led by upstart Johnny Wong. Wong, who is looking to usurp the old Triad bosses through his control of the illicit arms trade, is impressed by Alan&#x27;s skill and attempts to recruit him. Alan reluctantly accepts the offer, and Wong brings Alan to a raid on Hoi&#x27;s warehouse as an initiation, where many of Hoi&#x27;s men are killed. Surrounded, Hoi lets Alan kill him to spare his surrendering men, but Alan kills them all anyway to please Wong. Tequila, who has been watching from cover, ambushes and defeats Wong&#x27;s men, but is caught by Alan, who spares him. Tequila confronts Pang, demanding to know if Alan is an undercover cop. Pang refuses to say, but reveals the teahouse friendly fire killing to Tequila and warns him to stay away from the case.

Tequila tracks Alan to his sailboat and deduces he is undercover, but they are ambushed by the remnants of Hoi&#x27;s gang. The pair fight off the attackers and Tequila flees just before Wong arrives, allowing Alan to keep his cover. Wong realizes that one of his lieutenants, Foxy, is a police informant. Wong&#x27;s henchman, Mad Dog, beats Foxy before Alan is ordered to execute him with a shot to the chest, but a cigar lighter Alan placed in Foxy&#x27;s chest pocket earlier saves his life. Foxy finds Tequila at a jazz bar and informs him that Wong&#x27;s armory is hidden in a vault beneath a nearby hospital. As Tequila takes Foxy to the hospital, Wong discovers that Foxy is alive and sends Alan to kill him, while also discreetly sending Mad Dog to monitor Alan. At the hospital, Alan confronts Tequila, demanding to know the whereabouts of the vault; while the two are distracted, Mad Dog kills Foxy.

Alan and Tequila discover Wong&#x27;s vault, where they briefly skirmish with Mad Dog. As Pang, officer Teresa Chang, and other inspectors evacuate the hospital, Wong and his men attempt to gain leverage by taking the staff and patients hostage while indiscriminately shooting fleeing patients and responding police officers, irritating Mad Dog with his callousness. Alan and Tequila team up to rescue the hostages and battle Wong&#x27;s men; meanwhile, Pang evacuates the lobby and takes command at the police perimeter, while Chang and the Special Duties Unit rescue trapped babies from the maternity wing. As they fight their way through the hospital, Alan accidentally shoots a plainclothes officer and is overcome with guilt; Tequila consoles him by sharing his similar experience from the teahouse and encourages him to fight on.

The pair eventually confront Mad Dog again. While Tequila leaves to assist Chang and rescue one last baby, Alan and Mad Dog engage in a tense duel before ending in a standoff with a group of crippled patients between them. They allow the patients safe passage to leave, but Wong arrives and guns down the patients while trying to kill Alan, who escapes. Enraged, Mad Dog tries to kill Wong, but is gunned down when his pistol runs out of ammunition. Alan and Tequila kill the remaining gangsters and confront Wong, but he detonates bombs in the armory, setting the hospital ablaze and forcing Tequila to flee with the baby while Alan goes after Wong. As the hospital explodes, Wong drags Alan outside at gunpoint and forces Tequila to humiliate himself. Using this as a distraction, Alan wrestles for Wong&#x27;s pistol and ends up shooting himself in the chest, surprising Wong enough for Tequila to fatally shoot Wong in the head, before collapsing.

Alan is revealed to have survived the ordeal. To protect Alan from the Triads, Pang and Tequila destroy Alan&#x27;s personnel file and declare him dead, allowing him to leave Hong Kong to start a new life.

== Cast ==

* Chow Yun-fat as Inspector &quot;Tequila&quot; Yuen Ho-yan: A clarinet-playing, alcoholic police sergeant with a reputation for defying his superiors and bending police rules. Chow had previously worked with director John Woo on several of his films, including &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;The Killer&quot; and &quot;Once a Thief&quot;.
* Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Alan: An undercover cop posing as a high-ranking triad assassin. He makes an origami crane every time he kills someone, a trait which was influenced by Woo&#x27;s daughter when he saw her making them. Alan is shown as living alone on a yacht and considers himself to be asocial. Woo stated that this was influenced by Alain Delon&#x27;s character in the French crime film &quot;Le Samouraï&quot;. Leung had previously worked with Woo on his film &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot;.
* Teresa Mo as Teresa Chang: A fellow police officer who is the girlfriend of Tequila. She helps to decode the secret code songs that are sent to the police by Alan written on cards attached to bouquets that he has delivered to her. 
* Philip Chan as Supt. Pang: Tequila&#x27;s superior. Prior to the film, Chan was a police officer for about fifteen years. He felt that certain scenes in the film were very familiar as they were similar to real police work.
* Philip Kwok as Mad Dog: A skilled gunfighter and gang enforcer working for Johnny Wong.
* Anthony Wong as Johnny Wong: A scheming triad boss who plans to seize complete control of Hong Kong&#x27;s gangs using the earnings from his gun smuggling business, most of which are stored in the basement of a hospital.

* Stephen Tung as Foxy: Johnny&#x27;s lieutenant who secretly informs on his gang to Tequila. After he is exposed as a traitor, Alan intervenes to save his life. Foxy is later killed by Mad Dog at the hospital in which the final shoot-out takes place.
* John Woo as Bartender: A former cop who runs the jazz bar where Tequila performs and offers him advice.
* Jun Kunimura as Tea-House Gunman: A gun smuggler who kills Benny Mak at the teahouse and is subsequently gunned down by a vengeful Tequila. Credited as Y Yonemura in the film&#x27;s opening credits

== Production ==

=== Development ===

The film was originally developed in 1990. After creating films which focused on the lives of gangsters, director John Woo wanted to make a film that glorified the police instead. Woo admired Clint Eastwood&#x27;s and Steve McQueen&#x27;s characters from their films &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; and &quot;Bullitt&quot; respectively, and wanted to make his own Hong Kong-style &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; police detective film. While creating this character, Woo was inspired by a police officer who was a strong-willed and tough member of the police force, as well as being an avid drummer. This led to Woo having Tequila&#x27;s character be a musician as well as a cop.

Before production started, Woo told his actors that he was not going to make the film as stylish as his previous films, but to have it be more of an &quot;edgy thriller&quot;. The role of Teresa Chang was originally made for actress Michelle Yeoh, who had a long relationship with producer Terence Chang. After casting Teresa Mo, the character of Teresa Chang was greatly re-written.
The film&#x27;s initial story was about Tony Leung&#x27;s character being a psychopath who would poison baby food. When Terence Chang was making connections to have Woo make films in the United States, he found people uninterested and disgusted with the theme of babies being poisoned. This halted production for a month to develop a new story. Screenwriter Barry Wong was brought in to write a new story about Tony Leung&#x27;s character being an undercover police officer. After writing the first part of the script, Wong went on a vacation Germany, where he died, leaving the script unfinished.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Hard Boiled&quot; took 123 days to shoot in 1991. Although Woo told his cast that the film would be more gritty and not as stylish as his previous films, &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; became more stylish as the filming began. The tea house sequence in the film was shot before the script was written. The crew found that the teahouse was going to be torn down and decided to film a scene there. Woo saw the staircase in the teahouse, and thought about a scene where a character would come shooting down gun smugglers while sliding down the banister. The teahouse sequence was shot in around a week&#x27;s time and was choreographed by Woo and Philip Kwok. It was shot with interruptions from local triads in the area asking for protection money, and residents complaining about the noise.
The script of the film went through several changes during filming. Due to the length of the film, scenes from a side-story involving the relationship between the characters Tequila and Teresa Chang were cut. Another cut scene included Tequila playing clarinet over Benny&#x27;s grave. With these cuts, Chow Yun-fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung&#x27;s character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John Woo to insert a mentor character in the film, which Woo himself would play; Chow felt that having Woo in this role would make Woo not cut out these scenes. Philip Kwok&#x27;s role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set. Kwok first worked with Woo on his film &quot;Once a Thief&quot; and was asked to return to work on &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;. After reading the script, Woo felt that the character of Johnny Wong was not a strong enough physical threat. After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, Woo created the character of Mad Dog for him.

The scenes in the hospital maternity ward and the warehouse were shot at a studio called &quot;The Coca-Cola Factory&quot;, named for its former use as a Coca-Cola bottling plant. The hospital scenes took 40 days to shoot. The hospital segment&#x27;s location was chosen since they wanted to have an atypical location where gangs would hide their weapons. While filming in the hospital, the windows were covered with blast shields to give the appearance of night time, which allowed the crew to film at any time during the day. The cast and crew stayed in the hospital for days, often losing track of time. After long hours of filming in the hospital, the crew became exhausted. This prompted the direction of one of the climax&#x27;s action scenes, a lengthy shootout through the hospital&#x27;s halls, to be a five-minute long take, so as to shorten the time needed to film. To complete this, during a brief 20-second scene in the middle of the take inside an elevator, the crew quickly changed the set props and rigged the explosions and practical effects in time for the next scene to continue. While filming the hospital sequence, Tony Leung was injured when glass fragments went into his eyes, and he was hospitalized before returning after a week-long rest. Woo changed the ending of &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; after many members of the crew of the film felt that Leung&#x27;s character should survive at the film&#x27;s end.

=== Post-production ===
Woo is a fan of jazz music and wanted a jazz-style soundtrack for &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;. Woo had also previously wanted a singer to perform a jazz song and have Chow Yun-fat&#x27;s character play saxophone in his previous film &quot;The Killer&quot;. The producer for &quot;The Killer&quot;, Tsui Hark, rejected this idea for &quot;The Killer&quot;, feeling that Hong Kong audiences did not enjoy and understand jazz music. The score heard in &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; was created by jazz musician Michael Gibbs. During promotional screenings, the score for the film was different and was described as &quot;very haunting music&quot;, but this score ultimately could not be used as the production crew could not acquire the rights to the music. Other songs featured in the film, include &quot;Hello&quot; by Lionel Richie and the traditional song &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. Woo chose these songs specifically for their lyrics to suggest that Tony was a sort of pen pal to Teresa. All the characters in &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; had their voices dubbed by their own actors to save money. Woo stated this was convenient as he did not have to worry about setting up boom mics and other sound elements.

== Release ==

=== Theatrical run ===
&quot;Hard Boiled&quot; was released on 16 April 1992 in Hong Kong. The film grossed HK$19,711,048 which was not as strong of a box office reception as Woo&#x27;s &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; but was slightly better than the domestic gross of &quot;The Killer&quot;. On the film&#x27;s initial release in Hong Kong it debuted at number 3 in the box office where it was beaten by Tsui Hark&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time in China 2&quot; and the Stephen Chow film &quot;Fight Back to School II&quot;.

The North American premiere of &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; was in September 1992 at the Toronto International Film Festival. At the premiere, the audience response was very positive with people stomping their feet and yelling at the screen. This reception surprised producer Terence Chang who did not expect such a positive reaction. It had a limited US release in June 1993, grossing US$71,858. In France, it was released the same month and sold 85,104 tickets. &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; received a wide release in the United Kingdom on 8 October 1993.

=== Home media ===
A laserdisc edition of &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; was released by The Criterion Collection in December 1995. A region free DVD of &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; was released by The Criterion Collection on 10 July 1998. A second Region 1 DVD of the film was released by Fox Lorber. Fox Lorber released the film as a stand-alone release and as a double feature with &quot;The Killer&quot; on 3 October 2000. The most recent Region 1 release of &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; was from Dragon Dynasty, who released a two disc DVD of the film on 24 July 2007. The collector&#x27;s edition of the PlayStation 3 version of the video game Stranglehold, which served as a sequel to Hard Boiled, includes a remastered version of the film on the game disc, but it can only be played on a PlayStation 3 system.

For decades after going out of print on home media, the film was unavailable in Western territories due to rights issues with the film catalog of co-producer Golden Princess. Woo said in 2023 that the film, along with &quot;The Killer&quot;, could not be re-released without the approval of the rights holders. In early 2025, Shout! Studios acquired the worldwide rights (excluding select Asian countries) to the 156-film Golden Princess film catalog, with intentions to make the films available via both physical media and streaming platforms.

== Reception ==
Initial reception to &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; was positive. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found it difficult to follow both the action scenes and the subtitles at the same time, but stated that &quot;Mr. Woo does, in fact, seem to be a very brisk, talented director with a gift for the flashy effect and the bizarre confrontation.&quot; A review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;With &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;, John Woo shows himself to be the best director of contemporary action films anywhere.&quot;
&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; spoke positively about the action scenes, noting the &quot;epic shootouts that bookend Hard-Boiled, John Woo&#x27;s blood-soaked Hong Kong gangster extravaganza, are wondrously staged, brilliantly photographed tableaux.&quot; The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; proclaimed the film as &quot;arguably Woo&#x27;s masterpiece, it is an action film to end all action films, an experience so deliriously cinematic it makes &quot;True Romance&quot;, a film that clearly aspires to it, look like a cheap copy&quot; A review in &quot;Newsday&quot; gave the film three and a half stars, stating that &quot;Mayhem has never looked better than in John Woo&#x27;s latest high-caliber cops-and-robbers thriller, even if the plot is a bit slippery&quot; and that John Woo &quot;has blasted the action genre onto a whole new level. His shootouts are a ballet; his firebombings are poetry. And while he lets the body count get away from him, he constantly fascinates, through a combination of chaos and an excruciating control over what we&#x27;re allowed to see.&quot;
After the film&#x27;s initial release, critical reception continues to be positive; the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of 92%, with an average rating of 7.8 out of 10, based on 71 reviews. The website&#x27;s &quot;Critic&#x27;s Consensus&quot; for the film reads, &quot;Boasting impactful action as well as surprising emotional resonance, &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; is a powerful thriller that hits hard in more ways than one.&quot; Film scholar Andy Klein wrote that the film is &quot;almost a distillation of [Woo&#x27;s] post-1986 work. Even if the plot is full of holes, and the emotional tug isn&#x27;t quite as strong as in &quot;The Killer&quot;, the action sequences (nearly the whole movie) are among the greatest ever filmed&quot;. Mark Salisbury of &quot;Empire Magazine&quot; gave the film four stars out of five, calling it &quot;Infinitely more exciting than a dozen &quot;Die Hards&quot;, action cinema doesn&#x27;t come any better than this.&quot; Salisbury compared &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; to Woo&#x27;s American films, stating that his Hong Kong films are &quot;not as slick as his later films, [&quot;Hard Boiled&quot; is] more inventive and stylised and [has] great early performances from Fat and Leung&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; placed the film at number 70 in their list of &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. In 2023, Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Time&quot; put &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; on a list of the &quot;100 Best Movies of the Past 10 Decades&quot;, stating that Woo&#x27;s &quot;artistry lies in the way he shapes a sequence for maximum kinetic effect, creating mosaics of sound and action that leave you feeling exhilarated rather than beaten up.&quot; Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the film the highest rating of four stars, proclaiming it to be one of Woo&#x27;s best films. The British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; ranked the character of Tequila as 33rd in their &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot; poll.

==Accolades==
At the 12th Hong Kong Film Awards, David Wu and John Woo won the award for &quot;Best Film Editing&quot;. Tony Leung was nominated for &quot;Best Supporting Male Actor&quot;, but he refused the nomination on the grounds that he had a leading role in the film. His protest was supported by John Woo and Chow Yun-fat. This later led the Hong Kong Film Awards to change its nomination rules to allow for multiple leading roles from the same film.
== Video game ==

In 2007, Midway Games released the game &quot;Stranglehold&quot;. The game&#x27;s story and storyboards were made in collaboration with John Woo. The game features the character Tequila from &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;, who is travelling the globe in search of his kidnapped daughter. In 2009 John Woo&#x27;s production company Lion Rock Entertainment was reported to be developing a film version of the game, to be written by Jeremy Passmore and Andre Fabrizio.

<doc id="577624" wikidata="Q7366152" url="?curid=577624" title="Roofing filter">
<text>A roofing filter is a type of filter used in a HF radio receiver that limits the passband in the early stages of the receiver electronics. It blocks strong signals outside the receive channel which can overload following amplifier and mixer stages.

== Purpose ==
The roofing filter is usually found after the first receiver mixer (which normally contains an amplifier) to limit the first intermediate frequency (IF) stage&#x27;s passband. It prevents overloading later amplifier stages, which would cause nonlinearity (&quot;distortion&quot;) or clipping (&quot;buzz&quot;) even if the overload occurred on frequencies whose signal is not heard directly.

Roofing filters are usually crystal or ceramic filter types, with a passband for general purpose shortwave radio reception of about 6–20 kHz (for AM–NFM). The receiver&#x27;s bandwidth is &quot;not&quot; determined by the roofing filter passband, but instead by a follow-on crystal filter, mechanical filter, or DSP filter, all of which allow a much tighter filtering curve than a typical roofing filter.

For more demanding uses like listening to weak CW or SSB signals, a roofing filter is required that gives a smaller passband appropriate to the mode of the received signal. It is often used at a high first IF stage above 40 MHz, with passband widths of 250 Hz, 500 Hz (for CW), or 1.8 kHz (for SSB). These narrow filters require that the receiver uses a first IF well below VHF range, perhaps 9 or 11 MHz.

<doc id="577633" wikidata="Q1054345" url="?curid=577633" title="Cardinal Secretary of State">
<text>The Secretary of State of His Holiness (,
), known as the Cardinal Secretary of State, presides over the Secretariat of State of the Holy See, which is the oldest and most important dicastery of the Roman Curia. The Secretariat of State performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See and the Vatican City State. The secretary of state is sometimes described as the prime minister of the Holy See, even though the nominal head of government of Vatican City is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State.

Cardinal Pietro Parolin has been secretary of state since 2013.

==Duties==
The secretary of state is appointed by the Pope, and serves as one of his principal advisors. As one of the senior offices in the Roman Catholic Church, the secretary is required to be a cardinal. If the office is vacant, a someone other than a cardinal may serve as provisional secretary of state, exercising the powers of the Secretary of State until a suitable replacement is found or the Pro-Secretary is made a cardinal in a subsequent consistory.

The secretary&#x27;s term ends when the Pope who appointed him dies or leaves office. During the &quot;sede vacante&quot; period, the former secretary acts as a member of a commission with the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church and the former President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, which exercises some of the functions of the head of state of the Vatican City State until a new Pope is elected. Once the new Pope is chosen, the former secretary&#x27;s role in the commission likewise expires, though he can be re-appointed as Secretary of State.

==History==

The office traces its origins to that of &quot;secretarius intimus&quot;, created by Pope Leo X in the early 16th century to handle correspondence with the diplomatic missions of the Holy See, which were just beginning to become permanent postings instead of missions sent on particular occasions. At this stage the secretary was a fairly minor functionary, the papal administration being led by the Cardinal Nephew, the Pope&#x27;s confidant usually taken from his family.

The imprudence of Pope Julius III in entrusting the office of Cardinal Nephew to his alleged lover Innocenzo Ciocchi Del Monte, a teenaged, virtually illiterate street urchin whom his brother had adopted a few years earlier, led to an upgrading of the Secretary&#x27;s job, as the incumbent had to take over the duties the Cardinal Nephew was unfit for. By the time of Pope Innocent X the Secretary of State was always himself a Cardinal, and Pope Innocent XII abolished the office of Cardinal Nephew in 1692. From then onwards the Secretary of State has been the most important of the officials of the Holy See.

The separate position of Cardinal Secretary for Internal State Affairs was created by Pope Gregory XVI in 1833 at the request of Tommaso Bernetti, then Secretary of State, reducing the workload of the Secretary of State. 

In 1968, Pope Paul VI&#x27;s apostolic constitution &quot;Regimini Ecclesiae Universae&quot; further enhanced the powers of the Secretary of State, placing him over all the other departments of the Roman Curia. In 1973 Pope Paul further broadened the Secretaryship by abolishing the ancient office of Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church and merging its functions into those of the Secretary of State.

<doc id="577637" wikidata="Q1753003" url="?curid=577637" title="Closing Time (album)">
<text>Closing Time is the debut album by American singer-songwriter Tom Waits, released on March 6, 1973, on Asylum Records. Produced and arranged by former Lovin&#x27; Spoonful member Jerry Yester, &quot;Closing Time&quot; was the first of seven of Waits&#x27; major releases by Asylum.

The album is noted for being predominantly folk influenced although Waits intended &quot;Closing Time&quot; to be &quot;a jazz, piano-led album.&quot; Upon release, the album was mildly successful in the United States, although it did not chart and received little attention from music press in the United Kingdom and elsewhere internationally. Critical reaction to &quot;Closing Time&quot; was positive. The album&#x27;s only single, &quot;Ol&#x27; &#x27;55&quot;, attracted attention due to a cover version by Waits&#x27;s more popular label mates, the Eagles. Other songs from the album were covered by Tim Buckley and Bette Midler. The album was certified Gold in the UK and has gained a contemporary cult following among rock fans. Since its release, the album has been reissued on LP in 1976, on CD in 1992, 1999 and 2018. Also on 180 gram LP in 2010.

==Background==

Tom Waits began his musical career in 1969, performing every Monday night at The Troubadour, a venue in West Hollywood, California. Waits&#x27; setlist at these series of shows, described as &quot;hootenanny nights&quot;, consisted primarily of Bob Dylan covers, although it included songs which would later appear on &quot;Closing Time&quot; and its successor, &quot;The Heart of Saturday Night&quot; (1974). Among the songs performed were &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot;, &quot;Virginia Avenue&quot;, &quot;Ol&#x27; &#x27;55&quot;, &quot;I Hope That I Don&#x27;t Fall in Love with You&quot;, &quot;Shiver Me Timbers&quot; and &quot;Diamonds on my Windshield.&quot;

Around this time, Waits began working as a doorman at a San Diego, California, club, The Heritage, which was a coffee house by day. In November 1970, Waits performed his first paid show at The Heritage, earning $25 for his performance. At a Troubadour performance in summer 1971, Herb Cohen inadvertently spotted Waits and became his manager. Through Cohen&#x27;s contacts, Waits recorded demos in Los Angeles in late summer 1971 with producer Robert Duffey, later released as &quot;The Early Years&quot; in two volumes, against Waits&#x27; wishes.

In order to focus on his career, Waits relocated from San Diego to Los Angeles in early 1972 and performed more frequently at The Troubadour, where David Geffen discovered him performing &quot;Grapefruit Moon.&quot; The performance, which &quot;floored&quot; Geffen, led Geffen to negotiate with Waits&#x27; manager Cohen, and Waits signed to Asylum Records within a month.

==Recording==
Before recording the album, Waits became friends with his designated producer Jerry Yester and one afternoon in early 1972 recorded a pre-production tape in Yester&#x27;s residence. The instrumentation, recording arrangements, and musicians were also discussed during this session with Waits making it &quot;absolutely clear he wanted a standup bass player.&quot; Drummer John Seiter, guitarist Peter Klimes, trumpeter Tony Terran and additional guitarist Shep Cooke were recruited through Yester and through Seiter, jazz bassist Bill Plummer was hired.

The main recording sessions for &quot;Closing Time&quot; took place at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood, California—where Buffalo Springfield, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and the Doors had previously recorded—in Spring 1972. Yester fronted production and the sessions were held almost immediately after Waits&#x27; record deal, and were described as &quot;quick and efficient.&quot; Waits was &quot;nervous, but confident enough in his own material&quot; during the beginning of the sessions; however, as the sessions progressed, Waits and Yester &quot;were pulling against each other&quot; over the direction which the album would take, with Waits wanting a jazz-laden record and Yester more focused on producing a folk-based album. Despite this, Waits was &quot;absolutely communicative&quot; with his fellow musicians, articulating his direction and using metaphors to describe how he wanted the songs to sound.

The sessions took a total of ten days, with the first two days focusing on &quot;getting used to [the studio].&quot; Both Waits and Yester wanted to record during the evening, but as no slots were available, it was recorded through the morning and afternoon &quot;from ten to five every day.&quot; During the recording of &quot;Ol&#x27; &#x27;55&quot;, Seiter contributed backing vocals and &quot;came up with a perfect harmony line that started faintly before the chorus even began.&quot; The sessions concluded with a total of nine songs completed. Though unsatisfied with the number of songs, a second recording session was arranged the following week in United Western Recorders. The final session for &quot;Closing Time&quot; began the following Sunday, with guest musicians Arni Egilsson replacing Plummer and Jesse Erlich performing cello.

The title track, &quot;Closing Time&quot;, was the only song recorded in full, and Yester later described the session as &quot;the most magical session I&#x27;ve ever been involved with. At the end of it, no one spoke for what felt like five minutes, either in the booth or out in the room. No one budged. Nobody wanted the moment to end.&quot; String overdubs were later cut for &quot;Martha&quot; and &quot;Grapefruit Moon&quot; the following day. The final recordings were mixed and mastered at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco.

==Composition==

&quot;Closing Time&quot; features an eclectic mix of musical styles. Songs such as &quot;Ol &#x27;55&quot;, with its &quot;gentle slipnote piano chords&quot;, and &quot;Old Shoes&quot;, &quot;a country-rock waltz that picked up the feel of &#x27;Ol&#x27; 55&#x27;&quot;, are usually considered folk-like. Other songs such as &quot;Virginia Avenue&quot;, &quot;Midnight Lullaby&quot;, whose outro features an instrumental segment of the nursery rhyme &quot;Hush Little Baby&quot;, and &quot;Grapefruit Moon&quot; reveal a quieter, more jazz-like temperament. &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; is often noted as being the most &quot;up-tempo&quot; song of the album, whereas &quot;Lonely&quot; is toned-down and slow-paced. The sophisticated piano melodies are often accompanied by trumpets, typical of the jazz sound that Waits originally designated for the album. Noticeable string arrangements are also featured on the album, on &quot;Martha&quot; and the final song &quot;Closing Time&quot;, the latter being purely instrumental.

The songs on &quot;Closing Time&quot; are often noted for their lyrical content and vary in form. &quot;Ol&#x27; &#x27;55&quot; narrates the story of a man riding &quot;lickety splitly&quot; in a car and is often seen as a song about escapism, &quot;like his near-contemporary Bruce Springsteen.&quot; This theme is also present in &quot;Old Shoes&quot; which narrates another story about &quot;a footloose young stud hitting the road and semi-sneering&quot;, particularly in lyrics such as &quot;your tears cannot bind me anymore&quot; and &quot;my heart was not born to be tamed.&quot; Other lyrics on the album are described as melancholic, particularly &quot;Lonely&quot;, &quot;I Hope That I Don&#x27;t Fall in Love with You&quot; and &quot;Grapefruit Moon&quot;, which are &quot;both self-conscious and lacklustre&quot;. The intro to &quot;Midnight Lullaby&quot; borrows lyrics from the English nursery rhyme &quot;Sing a Song of Sixpence&quot;. This form of song-writing became a lifelong habit of Waits following the writing of &quot;Midnight Lullaby&quot;, in which he &quot;assembled lyrics from fragments of oral tradition.&quot;

==Packaging==
&quot;Closing Time&quot;″s art was designed by Cal Schenkel. Schenkel&#x27;s front cover art was inspired by &quot;Waits&#x27; own idea of how the album should sound.&quot; It depicts Waits leaning against a bar-room piano which is furnished with a shot of rye, a bottle of beer, cigarettes, an ashtray and a small candle with a blue pool table lamp above Waits&#x27; head. The back cover art is minimal and only features a photograph of Waits staring directly into the camera, reputedly taken after one of Waits&#x27; performances at The Troubadour. Both photographs were taken by Ed Caraeff.

==Release==
&quot;Closing Time&quot; was released by Asylum on March 6, 1973. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Ol&#x27; &#x27;55&quot;, was released a month before the album for promotion. The single featured the same song pressed on both sides of the record, with the A-side in mono and the B-side in stereo. Waits&#x27; first national tour coincided with the album&#x27;s release and ran from April to June 1973. The band consisted of Waits on vocals, acoustic guitar, and piano, Bob Webb on double bass, Rich Phelps on trumpet, and John Forsha on guitar. The tour started at The Cellar Door in Washington, D.C., with Waits opening for Tom Rush. Then he played at venues such as Max&#x27;s Kansas City in New York City and The Boarding House in San Francisco, opening for Danny O&#x27;Keefe, Charlie Rich, Buffalo Bob Smith—of &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;—and John P. Hammond. A second tour ran from November to December 1973 with Waits opening for Frank Zappa. This tour consisted of Waits on vocals, acoustic guitar, and piano, with Bob Webb on double bass. In 1999 Elektra Records reissued &quot;Closing Time&quot; in Europe on limited edition CD, and in 2010 Elektra and Asylum reissued the album on CD and LP, respectively.

==Reception==
After its release, &quot;Closing Time&quot; was received positively by the American music press, although coverage was limited. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, critic Stephen Holden praised it as &quot;a remarkable debut album&quot; and branded Waits as &quot;a boozier, earthier version&quot; of Randy Newman who similarly &quot;delights in rummaging through the attics of nostalgia&quot;. Holden nonetheless noted that &quot;the persona that emerges from [&quot;Closing Time&quot;] is Waits&#x27;s own, at once sardonic, vulnerable and emotionally charged&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau noted that with his &quot;jazz-schooled piano and drawling delivery ... Waits exploits an honest sentimentality which he undercuts just enough to be credible&quot;.

The album received little coverage internationally, with its promotion in the UK being little more than a featured advert in the &quot;NME&quot;. &quot;Closing Time&quot; did not chart upon its release although in 2000, the album peaked at number 28 in the Irish Albums Chart. The album was certified Silver in the United Kingdom in 2004 with shipments of over 60,000 copies and was later certified Gold in 2012 with shipments of over 100,000 copies.

==Legacy==
William Ruhlmann, in a retrospective AllMusic review, holds the album in high regard, describing Waits&#x27; &quot;lovelorn lyrics&quot; as being &quot;sentimental without being penetrating&quot;, while also noting Waits&#x27; &quot;gift for gently rolling pop melodies&quot; and &quot;self-conscious melancholy&quot;, the latter of which &quot;can be surprisingly moving&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Closing Time&quot; was voted number 880 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

&quot;Closing Time&quot; reached a wider audience through cover versions of its songs by more successful artists and have since continued to have been covered. Later in 1973, Tim Buckley released the album &quot;Sefronia&quot;, with a cover of &quot;Martha,&quot; the first ever cover of a Waits song by a known artist. Buckley&#x27;s version was also included in the 1995 tribute compilation &quot;Step Right Up: The Songs of Tom Waits&quot;. &quot;Martha&quot; was covered again in 1979 by Bette Midler on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and by Meat Loaf on &quot;Welcome to the Neighborhood&quot; (1995). &quot;Ol&#x27; &#x27;55&quot; was recorded by the Eagles for &quot;On the Border&quot; (1974). &quot;Rosie&quot; was recorded by the Beat Farmers for their album &quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot;. (1987) &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; was covered in 1991 by Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins for &quot;Black Music For White People&quot; and &quot;Lonely&quot; was covered live by Bat for Lashes and included on the deluxe edition of her album &quot;Two Suns&quot; (2009). Covers of &quot;I Hope That I Don&#x27;t Fall in Love with You&quot; can be found on &quot;Step Right Up&quot; (by 10,000 Maniacs), &quot;The Prince and Me&quot; soundtrack (by Marc Cohn), Hootie &amp; the Blowfish&#x27;s &quot;Scattered, Smothered and Covered&quot; compilation, 10,000 Maniacs&#x27; &quot;Campfire Songs&quot; compilation, and &quot;Heart and Soul,&quot; an episode of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, where it is sung by Jon Bon Jovi.

<text>Khaled Kelkal () (April 28, 1971 – September 29, 1995) was a French and Algerian terrorist affiliated with the GIA. He was involved in the 1995 terror bombings in France.

==Biography==
Khaled Kelkal was born in 1971 in Mostaganem, Algeria. The family moved to Vaulx-en-Velin, a suburb of Lyon, when he was an infant. He had four sisters and three brothers. While attending &quot;La Martinière&quot; lycée top of his class in Lyon, he became a juvenile delinquent. His older brother Nouredine was sentenced to 9 years in prison for armed robbery. In 1990, Kelkal was placed on probation for four months for trafficking in stolen cars. A few months later, he was arrested for thefts using cars as battering rams to enter private properties. He was sentenced to four years in prison.

==Conversion to radical Islam==
While he was incarcerated, he met &quot;Khelif,&quot; an Islamist who had fled France to evade trial. Upon his return to France in 1989 he was sentenced to 7 years in prison. While in jail, Khelif attempted to recruit Algerians to man militant organisations in Algeria. After his release, Kelkal regularly attended the Bilal Mosque in Vaulx-en-Velin; the mosque was headed by imam Mohamed Minta, a sympathiser of the &quot;Foi et Pratique&quot; (&quot;Faith and practice&quot;) fundamentalist organisation. In 1993, Kelkal went to Mostaganem, in Algeria, to visit his family. There, he was probably recruited by one of the radical branches of the GIA, headed by Djamel Zitouni, whose aim was to &quot;punish France.&quot;

==Criminal activities ==
On 11 July 1995, Kelkal was involved in the assassination of Imam Sahraoui in his mosque in Paris. Sahraoui was considered too moderate by the GIA, and might have attempted to steal money from them. Four days later, in Bron, a suburb of Lyon, Kelkal opened fire on gendarmes at a checkpoint and evaded arrest. On 26 August 1995, during the bombing campaign in France, a gas bottle equipped with a detonation system was found near the Paris-Lyon TGV railway, near Cailloux-Sur-Fontaines (Rhône). The device had not exploded, and was found to be similar to the one which had been set off on 25 July in the Saint-Michel–Notre-Dame RER station. Fingerprints of Khaled Kelkal were found on the bomb, and a search for him began. His picture was displayed in public places all over France.

==Death==
On 29 September 1995, after a search in the forest of Malval near Lyon, Kelkal was found in a place called &quot;La Maison Blanche&quot;. He attempted to resist arrest and was shot dead by the gendarmes of EPIGN. Kelkal&#x27;s death was shown on television, and a debate erupted over the shooting. On the television footage, as the gendarmes approach Kelkal, one of them was heard yelling &quot;Finis-le, finis-le !&quot; (&quot;Finish him, Finish him!&quot;) Initially, Kelkal was shot in the leg, but he aimed a pistol at the gendarmes, who opened fire in self-defence.

==Aftermath==
Using Kelkal&#x27;s address book, the police arrested other terrorists. Boualem Bensaïd, Kelkal&#x27;s superior, was arrested in Paris, as he was planning the bombing in a market of Lille. Further investigations revealed that Kelkal had been behind the car bomb that exploded in front of a Jewish school on 7 September 1995 in Villeurbanne, a suburb of Lyon, which was set to explode as the children left the building at the end of the school day. By a stroke of luck, the school bell rang late and no children were outside when the bomb detonated.

<doc id="577648" wikidata="Q2735634" url="?curid=577648" title="2004 Indonesian legislative election">
<text>Legislative elections were held in on 5 April 2004 for both houses of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly of Indonesia. This included all 550 seats in the People&#x27;s Representative Council and 128 seats of the newly formed Regional Representative Council.

Final results of the popular vote tally showed that Golkar, the former ruling party of the New Order era, received the most votes. It had lost to the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle in the 1999 legislative election. The Democratic Party and the Prosperous Justice Party, two of the newest parties to participate in the elections, received a combined 15% of the popular vote.

Based on the final allocation of seats in the People&#x27;s Representative Council, Golkar, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, the National Awakening Party, the United Development Party, the Democratic Party, the Prosperous Justice Party, and the National Mandate Party were qualified to submit candidates for the country&#x27;s first direct presidential election later in the year.

The election has been described as the most complicated election in the history of democracy.

==Background==

During its 2002 annual session, the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 amendments to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganise the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all the seats in the MPR were directly elected, this called for the removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President were significant steps for Indonesia on the road towards full democracy.

On 13 July 2003, President Megawati Sukarnoputri signed into effect a law outlining the composition of the reorganised MPR. The new DPD was composed of four representatives from each of the 32 provinces of Indonesia, not totalling more than one-third of the members of the DPR. The revised constitution also set membership in the DPR at 550.

==Electoral campaign==
During the first phases of registration, 150 parties were registered with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. However, this number was reduced to 50 and then 24 after scrutiny from the newly created General Election Commission. This reduction from the 48 parties that stood in the 1999 legislative election was attributed mainly to a new election law that allowed only parties that had won 2% of seats in the DPR, or 3% of seats in provincial and municipal legislatures in half of the provinces to stand in the 2004 election. Only six parties met this requirement, and the remaining parties were required to merge or reorganise into a new party.

The campaign period for parties and candidates began on 11 March and continued until 1 April. It was split into two phases by Nyepi, the Balinese day of silence. Parties delivered their national agendas indoors between 11 and 25 March. Although this was meant to encourage dialogue between parties and their constituents, these events were poorly attended. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems conducted a tracking survey that showed not all voters knew how to vote for candidates of the new DPD, or were even aware it existed.

Up to 475,000 candidates were nominated by the political parties in the national, provincial, and regental levels. More than 1,200 candidates stood for 128 seats in the DPD, and 7,756 candidates stood for 550 seats in the DPR. Candidates were elected in an open list system.

===Conduct===
Election day, 5 April, was relatively free of major incidents and irregularities. Minor violations included officials helping elderly voters cast and submit ballots. Two Indonesian election officials were also reported killed when delivering voting equipment in Papua. The Australian Parliamentary Observer Delegation and the European Union Election Observer Mission were among the organisations observing the election.

==Results==
The election results determined which political parties were eligible to submit candidates for Indonesia&#x27;s first direct presidential election, which was held on 5 July. Only parties that received 5% of the popular vote or 3% of seats in the People&#x27;s Representative Council could submit candidates. Parties that did not meet these criteria had to join with other parties to meet at least one criterion.

The counting of votes took one month, and the final results were announced on 5 May, one week later than was initially scheduled. Of 148,000,369 registered voters, 124,420,339 ballots (84%) were submitted. Of these ballots, 113,462,414 were considered valid, and 10,957,925 were declared invalid. In the People&#x27;s Representative Council, Golkar received the most number of seats. It had previously lost to the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle in the 1999 legislative election after being in power since 1970. However, fourteen of the twenty-four participating parties refused to certify the election results after allegations of irregular vote counting.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

===By province===
===Seat allocation===
To achieve proportional representation, seat allocation was conducted using the largest remainder method, whereby the Hare quota was used to determine seats automatically secured by individual parties. Any remaining seats assigned to the electoral region were allocated to remaining political parties based on the rank order of their remaining votes.

A total of 273 disputes were brought before the Constitutional Court, the last of which were decided on 21 June. Of these cases, 38 decisions affected the final allocation of seats in the People&#x27;s Representative Council and provincial and regental legislatures. The Democratic Party lost two seats, one to the National Mandate Party and Prosperous Peace Party each. The Pioneers&#x27; Party gained one seat from the United Democratic Nationhood Party. Meanwhile, the only seat allocated to the Freedom Bull National Party by the General Election Commission was reassigned to the Reform Star Party.

After the resolution of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People&#x27;s Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency in the order of parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that the Hare quota values for the provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the same number of seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party&#x27;s stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.

===Analysis===
Results showed that Golkar, the former ruling party of the New Order era led by People&#x27;s Representative Council Speaker Akbar Tanjung, had won the most number of seats, defeating President Megawati Sukarnoputri&#x27;s Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P). Golkar received more votes than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results occurred because of declining PDI-P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar&#x27;s popularity. Golkar&#x27;s support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due to the performance of medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI-P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah devastated the island province&#x27;s economy.

Both the National Awakening Party (PKB) and the United Development Party (PPP), both of whom were considered Islamist parties, maintained their rankings in the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The PKB, co-founded by former President and former Nahdlatul Ulama Chairman Abdurrahman Wahid, continued to perform well in its stronghold of East Java despite losing votes.

The Islamic Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and the Democratic Party (PD) finished first and second, respectively, in Jakarta, where voting patterns were considered a &quot;barometer of Indonesian politics&quot;. Together, both parties received 43% of the vote in the capital city.

Polarisation of voting patterns based on religion was evident in the eastern provinces. Christianity-based Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) received 15% of the vote in Christian-dominated North Sulawesi and 13 seats overall in the People&#x27;s Representative Council. Likewise, Muslims were more likely to vote for the PKS in regions where religious conflict has been historically prevalent.

==Aftermath==
The 2004 legislative election was the most complicated in Indonesian history because Indonesians had to vote for representatives at the national, provincial, and regental levels. These factors made Indonesia&#x27;s electoral system unique from other systems in the world. The election was described as the longest and most complicated election in the history of democracy and secured the nation&#x27;s place as the world&#x27;s third-largest democracy. Even before the election, the seat allocation system for the People&#x27;s Representative Council was also deemed &quot;the most complicated in the world&quot; by several news sources across the country.

Seven political parties met the criteria to submit candidates for the July presidential election: Golkar, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), the National Awakening Party (PKB), the United Development Party (PPP), the Democratic Party (PD), the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), and the National Mandate Party (PAN). The PKS was the only party not to nominate candidates, but it threw its support behind PAN&#x27;s Amien Rais.

Newly elected members of the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) and members of the Regional Representative Council (DPD) took the oath of office in separate sessions on 1 October, one day later than was scheduled. Both houses then convened together in the early morning of 2 October and took the oath of office as the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR). Ginandjar Kartasasmita was elected the inaugural chairman of the DPD with 72 of 128 votes in a run-off against Irman Gusman on 1 October. The following day, Agung Laksono of Golkar was elected Speaker of the DPR by a vote of 280 to 257. The Chairman of the MPR was not elected until several days later when Hidayat Nur Wahid of the PKS won the vote 326 to 324 against PDI-P&#x27;s Sutjipto.

On 5 October three regencies were carved out of the province of South Sulawesi to form West Sulawesi as the 33rd province of Indonesia. Because this occurred after the elections, West Sulawesi was not represented in the Regional Representative Council until the 2009 legislative election.

<text>Clapham Common is a large triangular urban park in Clapham, south London, England. Originally common land for the parishes of Battersea and Clapham, it was converted to parkland under the terms of the Metropolitan Commons Act 1878. It is of green space, with three ponds and a Victorian bandstand. It is overlooked by large Georgian and Victorian mansions and nearby Clapham Old Town.

Holy Trinity Clapham, an 18th-century Georgian church overlooking the park, is important in the history of the evangelical Clapham Sect. Half of the park is within the London Borough of Wandsworth, and the other half is within the London Borough of Lambeth.

== History ==
Originally common land for the parishes of Battersea and Clapham, William Hewer was among the early Londoners to build adjacent to it. Samuel Pepys, the diarist, died at Hewer&#x27;s house in 1703. The land had been used for cricket in 1700 and was drained in the 1760s, and from the 1790s onwards fine houses were built around the common as fashionable dwellings for wealthy business people in what was then a village detached from metropolitan London. Some later residents were members of the Clapham Sect of evangelical reformers and slavery abolitionists, including William Wilberforce, Lord Teignmouth and Henry Thornton.

In the early 1770s, during his stay in London representing America in affairs of the state, Benjamin Franklin had written a paper explaining how he used the ponds for science experiments, and in developing a &quot;magic&quot; trick. While traveling on a ship, Franklin had observed that the wake of a ship was diminished when the cooks scuttled their greasy water. He studied the effects at Clapham Common on a large pond there. &quot;I fetched out a cruet of oil and dropt a little of it on the water ... though not more than a teaspoon full, produced an instant calm over a space of several yards square.&quot; He later used the trick to &quot;calm the waters&quot; by carrying &quot;a little oil in the hollow joint of my cane.&quot;

J. M. W. Turner painted &quot;View on Clapham Common&quot; between 1800 and 1805, showing that even though the common had been drained, it still remained &quot;quite a wild place&quot;.

The common was converted to parkland under the terms of the Metropolitan Commons Act in 1878. As London expanded in the 19th century, Clapham was absorbed into the capital, with most of the remaining palatial or agricultural estates replaced with terraced housing by the early 1900s.

In 1911, Scottish evangelist and teacher Oswald Chambers founded and was principal of the Bible Training College in Clapham Common, an &quot;embarrassingly elegant&quot; property situated at 45 North Side that had been purchased by the Pentecostal League of Prayer.

During World War II, a heavy anti-aircraft artillery site had been set up on the common. Storage bunkers were built on the Battersea Rise side; two mounds remain.

== Governance ==
Half of the common is within the London Borough of Wandsworth and half within the London Borough of Lambeth. It is wholly managed and maintained by Lambeth Council. Policing of the open space is divided between the Wandsworth and Lambeth borough &quot;commands&quot; of the Metropolitan Police, which follow the local government boundaries. The roads surrounding the common fall within the SW4, SW11 and SW12 postcodes.

== Local government ==
Electoral wards for Lambeth are within the eastern half of the common; mainly in the Clapham Common and Abbeville ward with smaller parts divided between the Clapham Town ward and Clapham East ward. In Wandsworth, most of the western half of the common is in the Northcote ward and a small part of the south-western corner is in the Balham ward.

== Amenities ==
Clapham Common has a range of sporting facilities, including tennis and netball courts, a running track, bowling green, cricket, football, rugby and Australian rules football pitches, and a skateboard venue. In 2021, Foot Locker, in partnership with the NBA, completed the refurbishment of the Clapham Common Basketball Court.

The park contains three ponds, two of which are historical features, and a more modern paddling pool known as Cock Pond. Eagle Pond and Mount Pond are used for angling and contain a variety of species including carp to 20 lb, roach, tench and bream. Eagle Pond was extensively refurbished in 2005 when it was completely drained, landscaped and replanted to provide a better habitat for the fish it contained. Long Pond has a century-old tradition of use for model boating.

Holy Trinity Church (1776) is close to the north side of the park. An Anglican church, it hosts its fete in the park every summer.

Clapham Common and Clapham South Underground stations are on the edge of the common at its easternmost and southernmost points respectively. Both stations are served by the Northern line.

== The bandstand ==
In the centre of the park is a bandstand constructed in 1890. It is the largest bandstand in London and a Grade II listed building. For many years it was also erroneously thought to be one of the bandstands first erected in 1861 in the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s gardens in South Kensington, which would have made it the oldest surviving cast iron bandstand in Europe. However, further research has shown that these bandstands went to Southwark Park and Peckham Rye, and it appears that the Clapham bandstand was fabricated to a very similar design almost thirty years later.
The bandstand&#x27;s maintenance had been neglected by Lambeth Council for thirty years, and by 2001 it was thought to be in danger of collapse and had to be shored up with scaffolding for five years. In 2005–2006, a full restoration of the bandstand and surrounding landscape took place, partly funded by an £895,000 lottery grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund matched by £300,000 from Lambeth Council and a further £100,000 from local fundraising efforts and the proceeds of the &quot;Ben and Jerry&#x27;s Summer Sundae&quot; event held on the common. The drainage bund around the bandstand was restored with granite setts during the summer of 2011 at a cost of £12,000 to resolve design faults in the earlier works.

== Events ==
The park has hosted various musical festivals, including Colourscape Music Festival since 1989,; Get Loaded in the Park, from 2004 to 2011 when Razorlight were the headline act; South West Four Eurodance music festival annually in August since 2004; and other music events, such as Subway Picnic Rocks in 2008, organised by Action Against Hunger In 2014 the Calling Festival, which had previously been held in Hyde Park under the name Hard Rock Calling Festival, moved to Clapham Common; artists included Aerosmith and Stevie Wonder.

Sporting events held in Clapham Common and sports teams based in the park include the Latin American football League, which has played organised football on the red car pitches located on the south side of the park since the 1980s; the British Australian Rules Football League Grand Final, for which the park is the traditional venue; South West London Chargers rugby club formed in 2013 have their home in the park; Sunday league football is regularly played with London Titans and Clapham Alexandra football clubs using the park; various teams from other sports are also active on the park, including softball and korfball.

A Lesbian &amp; Gay Pride event, to be termed Pride House, was planned to take place on the park during the 2012 Summer Olympics, but ran into opposition from the Friends of Clapham Common and was eventually cancelled for lack of funding. Every Easter and February half-term George Irvin&#x27;s Funfair visits the park.

On 13 March 2021, a vigil was held on the common following the death of Sarah Everard, who was kidnapped nearby.

== Cruising ==

Clapham Common has a reputation as a place for men seeking anonymous sex with other men in public places. When Welsh politician Ron Davies was robbed at knifepoint in 1998 after he gave a lift to strangers he had met in the park, there was speculation that the incident involved &quot;cruising&quot;; Davies resigned his position in the UK government, denying the incident had anything to do with drugs or sex. There have been several attacks on men in the vicinity of the park, including one in 2005 on a young man, Jody Dobrowski, thought by his attackers to be gay, during which he was badly beaten and later died. The incident was the impetus for the making of the 2007 Channel 4 film &quot;Clapham Junction&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

*Writer and journalist Graham Greene, who lived at Clapham Common North Side, set his 1951 novel &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; in and around the area. The location is also referenced in the 1999 film adaptation of the book.

*The common is mentioned in the 1963 novel &quot;Up the Junction&quot; by Nell Dunn.

*The &quot;... windy common&quot; appears in the lyrics of the 1979 song also titled &quot;Up the Junction&quot; by Squeeze. The title was inspired by the 1965 BBC TV adaptation of Nell Dunn&#x27;s book and directed by Ken Loach.

*The area is a backdrop in the 1985 film &quot;The Good Father&quot; starring Anthony Hopkins.

*Clapham Common is featured in a 1989 episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; TV series titled &quot;The Adventure of the Clapham Cook&quot;, adapted from an Agatha Christie short story.

<text>William Peter Blatty (January 7, 1928 – January 12, 2017) was an American writer, director and producer. He is best known for his 1971 novel &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and for his screenplay for the 1973 film adaptation. Blatty won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, and was nominated for Best Picture as its producer. The film also earned Blatty a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama as producer.

Born and raised in New York City, Blatty received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Georgetown University in 1950, and his master&#x27;s degree in English literature from the George Washington University. Following completion of his master&#x27;s degree in 1954, he joined the United States Air Force and served in the Psychological Warfare Division where he attained the rank of first lieutenant. After service in the air force, he worked for the United States Information Agency in Beirut.

After the success of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, Blatty reworked his 1966 novel &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane!&quot; into a new novel titled &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;, published in 1978. He went on to adapt the novel into the 1980 film, which was also his directorial debut. At the 38th Golden Globe Awards, the film won Best Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture.

Blatty refused to have any involvement with the first sequel to &quot;The Exorcist&quot;; it was critically panned. He directed the second sequel, &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990), which he adapted from his 1983 novel &quot;Legion&quot;. His second film as a director, &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; was his final directorial credit and final screenplay credit. Some of his later novels include &quot;Elsewhere&quot; (2009), &quot;Dimiter&quot; (2010) and &quot;Crazy&quot; (2010).

==Early life and education==
Blatty was born on January 7, 1928, in New York City. He was the fifth
and youngest child of Lebanese immigrants, Mary (née Mouakad; ), a devout Melkite Catholic and the niece of bishop Germanos Mouakkad, and Peter Blatty (), a cloth cutter. His parents separated when he was a toddler. He was raised in what he described as &quot;comfortable destitution&quot; by his deeply religious mother, whose sole support came from peddling homemade quince jelly in the streets of Manhattan; she once offered a jar of it to Franklin D. Roosevelt when the President was cutting the ribbon for the Queens–Midtown Tunnel, telling him, &quot;For when you have company.&quot; He lived at 28 different addresses during his childhood because of nonpayment of rent. &quot;We never lived at the same address in New York for longer than two or three months at a time,&quot; Blatty told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1972. &quot;Eviction was the order of the day.&quot; Blatty&#x27;s mother died in 1967.

He attended Brooklyn Preparatory, a Jesuit school, on a scholarship and graduated as class valedictorian in 1946. He later attended Georgetown University on a scholarship, where he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in English in 1950. &quot;Those years at Georgetown were probably the best years of my life,&quot; Blatty said in 2015. &quot;Until then, I’d never had a home.&quot; While studying for his master&#x27;s degree at George Washington University, Blatty took menial jobs. Initially unable to find a job in teaching, he worked as a vacuum-cleaner door-to-door salesman, a beer-truck driver, and as a United Airlines ticket agent. He earned his master&#x27;s in English literature from the George Washington University in 1954. He then enlisted in the United States Air Force.

Mustering out of the Air Force, he joined the United States Information Agency and worked as an editor based in Beirut, Lebanon. Eventually, his writing talent emerged, and he began submitting humorous articles to magazines.

==Career==
In the late 1950s, Blatty worked as the public relations director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, &quot;Which Way to Mecca, Jack?&quot; in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and his work at the United States Information Agency in Lebanon. The book also tells of his successful masquerade as a Saudi Arabian prince when he got to Los Angeles. In 1961, while still pretending to be a prince, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.

He then published the comic novels: &quot;John Goldfarb, Please Come Home!&quot; (1963), &quot;I, Billy Shakespeare&quot; (1965), and &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane&quot; (1966). He achieved critical success with these books – Marvin Levin in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, for example, wrote: &quot;Nobody can write funnier lines than William Peter Blatty, a gifted virtuoso who writes like [S. J.] Perelman&quot;; but significant sales were lacking. It was at this point that Blatty began a collaboration with director Blake Edwards, writing scripts for comedy films such as: &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1964), &quot;What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?&quot; (1966), &quot;Gunn&quot; (1967), and &quot;Darling Lili&quot; (1970), a musical starring Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson. Blatty also worked on his own using the name &quot;Bill Blatty&quot; writing comedy screenplays such as those for the Danny Kaye film &quot;The Man from the Diners&#x27; Club&quot; (1963), and the Warren Beatty/Leslie Caron film &quot;Promise Her Anything&quot; (1965). Other screenplays include the film adaptation of &quot;John Goldfarb, Please Come Home!&quot; (1965), and &quot;The Great Bank Robbery&quot; (1969).

Later Blatty resumed writing fiction. In 1971, he wrote &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, the story of a twelve-year-old girl possessed by a powerful demon, that topped &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 17 weeks and remained on the list for 57 consecutive weeks. The book sold more than 13 million copies in the United States alone and was translated into over a dozen languages. He later adapted it with director William Friedkin into the film version. Blatty went on to win an Academy Award for his &quot;Exorcist&quot; screenplay, as well as Golden Globes for Best Picture and Best Writing. It also became the first horror film ever to be nominated for the best picture Oscar.

In 1978, Blatty adapted his novel &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, &quot;Killer&quot; Kane&quot; into a new book titled &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;, and in 1980 he wrote, directed, and produced a film version, which focused on the question of the existence of God. The film was a commercial flop despite critical acclaim. Movie critic Jerry Stein called it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; in &quot;The Cincinnati Post,&quot; and Peter Travers described it as &quot;the finest large-scale American surrealist film ever made&quot; in &quot;People&quot; magazine. At the 38th Golden Globe Awards in 1981 it was nominated for three Golden Globes, and won the Best Writing Award against competition that included &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980), &quot;Ordinary People&quot; (1980), and &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980). In 1983, Blatty wrote &quot;Legion&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; which later became the basis of the film &quot;The Exorcist III&quot;. At first he was unable to set up the production because he wanted to direct the film. with producer Carter DeHaven at Morgan Creek Productions. Blatty directed the film. He originally wanted the movie version to be titled &quot;Legion&quot;, but the film&#x27;s producers wanted it to be more closely linked to the original. The first sequel, &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977), was disappointing both critically and commercially. Blatty had no involvement with it and his own follow-up ignored it entirely.

Blatty&#x27;s son Peter Vincent Blatty died from a rare heart disorder in 2006 at the age of 19. His death was the subject of Blatty&#x27;s non-fiction book that is &quot;part comic memoir, part argument for life after death&quot;, titled, &quot;Finding Peter: A True Story of the Hand of Providence and Evidence of Life After Death&quot; (2015).

In 2011, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and audiobook formats with new cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; will have a touch of new material in it as part of an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot; and &quot;Legion&quot;, with new, updated cover artwork.

&quot;The Exorcist&quot; was eventually adapted into a stage play starring Richard Chamberlain and Brooke Shields in 2012 and a TV series starring Geena Davis in 2016.

==Personal life==
Blatty married four times and had seven children. With his first wife, Mary Margaret Rigard, whom he married on February 18, 1950, he had three children: Christine Ann, Michael Peter, and Mary Joanne. His first marriage ended in divorce after 13 years. His second wife was Elizabeth Gilman, whom he married in 1965. In July 1975 he married his third wife, tennis professional Linda Tuero, with whom he had two children: restaurant entrepreneur Billy and photojournalist J. T. Blatty. Following the dissolution of his first three marriages, Blatty married Julie Alicia Witbrodt, his fourth wife, in 1983, with whom he had two children. The couple remained together until Blatty&#x27;s death. After residing for many years in Hollywood and Aspen, Blatty settled in Bethesda, Maryland in 2000.

Blatty was a Roman Catholic. In 2012, he filed a canon law petition against his alma mater, Georgetown University, which he said has been at variance with Catholic Church teaching for decades, inviting speakers who support abortion rights and disobeying Pope John Paul II&#x27;s instructions issued to Church-affiliated colleges and universities in 1990. The Vatican rejected the petition in 2014. In a response letter to Blatty, Archbishop Angelo Zani stated that this was because Blatty had not “suffered an objective change” at Georgetown&#x27;s hands, but acknowledged that Blatty&#x27;s case constituted &quot;a well-founded complaint&quot;.

==Death==
Blatty died of multiple myeloma on January 12, 2017, at a hospital in Bethesda, five days after his 89th birthday.

<text>Mühlacker is a town in the eastern part of the Enz district of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Mühlacker station has direct rail connections with Stuttgart, Karlsruhe, Heidelberg, Pforzheim and the Northern Black Forest.

Mühlhausen an der Enz where Spree killer Ernst August Wagner killed 13 people in 1913 has been a part of the city since 1972. The community of Ötisheim joined onto the city so as to act as a single municipality for certain tasks.

==History==
===Thirty Years&#x27; War===
The Thirty Years&#x27; War brought hardship and misery. In 1648 only 50 inhabitants survived from originally 1242 inhabitants (1622). In the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697) Dürrmenz was looted in 1692 by French troops. Eckenweiher was incorporated to Dürrmenz in 1832.

===Industrialisation===
With the opening of the Württemberg Western Railway Stuttgart - Bruchsal in 1853 the industrial age began in the Dürrmenz-Mühlacker area. As the Karlsruhe-Mühlacker railway was built in 1863, Mühlacker was at the same railway junction and border station. As a curiosity, until 1930 it had two stations side by side, the larger Württemberg station and the Baden railway station. Favored by the dismantling of custom barriers 1819-1851 and the abolition of the compulsory guild (1862), industrial enterprises settled near the train station.

===20th century===
After World War I, inflation, Great Depression and high unemployment interrupted the further development. In 1930, the large Mühlacker radio transmitter was put into operation.

With the dissolution of Oberamt Maulbronn, young city Mühlacker in 1938 was incorporated into district Vaihingen. During the Nazi period five of the eight Jewish citizens of Mühlacker were murdered in Auschwitz.

The World War II ended in Mühlacker with destruction by air raids and artillery shelling. After 1945, 3000 refugees and displaced persons found settled in Mühlacker.

As part of the district reform on January 1, 1973, the district Vaihingen was dissolved. The western region, with the town of Mühlacker became part of the newly formed Enzkreis. The eastern part of the district Vaihingen was incorporated into the district of Ludwigsburg.

==Climate==

==Sights==
Since 1930, Mühlacker has been transmitter site, at which between 1934 and 1945 the tallest tower ever built of wood stood (height: 190 metres).

Further landmark are the water tower and the Löffelstelz castle ruin.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Mühlacker is twinned with:
* Bassano del Grappa, Italy
* Schmölln, Germany

==Notable people==
*Anna Catharina Wedderkopf (1715–1786), businesswoman, consultant and feminist
*Hellmut G. Haasis (born 1942), writer and historian
*Verena Veh (born 1977), volleyball player
*Florian Naroska (born 1982), water polo player

<text>Singles is a 1992 American romantic comedy film written, co-produced, and directed by Cameron Crowe, and starring Bridget Fonda, Campbell Scott, Kyra Sedgwick, and Matt Dillon. It features appearances from several musicians prominent in the early 1990s grunge movement in Seattle.

The film was distributed by Warner Bros. and released theatrically on September 18, 1992 to generally positive reviews from critics and moderate box office success, grossing over $18 million.

== Plot ==
&quot;Singles&quot; centers on the precarious romantic lives of a group of twentysomethings in Seattle, Washington at the start of the 1990s grunge phenomenon. Most of the characters dwell in an apartment block, a sign in front of which advertises &quot;Singles&quot; (single bedroom apartments) for rent. Divided into chapters, the film focuses on the course of two couples&#x27; rocky romances, as well as the love lives of their friends and associates.

The film revolves around Janet Livermore, a coffee-bar waitress fawning over Cliff Poncier, an aspiring yet slightly aloof grunge rock musician of the fictional grunge/rock band Citizen Dick; Linda Powell and Steve Dunne, a couple wavering on whether to commit to each other; Debbie Hunt, trying to find Mr. Right.

== Cast ==

* Bridget Fonda as Janet Livermore
* Campbell Scott as Steve Dunne
* Kyra Sedgwick as Linda Powell
* Sheila Kelley as Debbie Hunt
* Jim True-Frost as David Bailey
* Matt Dillon as Cliff Poncier
* Bill Pullman as Dr. Jeffrey Jamison
* James LeGros as Andy
* Devon Raymond as Ruth
* Camilo Gallardo as Luiz
* Ally Walker as Pam
* Eric Stoltz as The Mime
* Jeremy Piven as Doug Hughley
* Tom Skerritt as Mayor Weber
* Peter Horton as Jamie
Eddie Vedder, Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament play the band members of Citizen Dick. There are appearances from Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, as well as cameos by film director Tim Burton and basketball player Xavier McDaniel as himself. Paul Giamatti appears in a minor role.

Johnny Depp was offered the role of Steve Dunne but declined.

== Production ==
Filming began on March 11, 1991. Principal photography wrapped on May 24, 1991.

The film was shot at a number of locations around Seattle and includes scenes at Gas Works Park, Capitol Hill, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s original grave at Greenwood Memorial Park in Renton, the Pike Place Market and the Virginia Inn. The central coffee shop featured in the film is the now-closed OK Hotel. The apartment building is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of E. Thomas St &amp; 19th Ave E. (1820 E. Thomas St.). Additional concert footage was shot in the now-defunct RKCNDY bar. Alice in Chains&#x27; concert was filmed at the Desoto nightclub. Also, Soundgarden makes an appearance in the film.

 Most of Matt Dillon&#x27;s wardrobe in the movie actually belonged to Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament. During the making of the film, Ament produced a list of song titles for the fictional band, Citizen Dick. Chris Cornell took it as a challenge to write songs for the film using those titles, and &quot;Spoonman&quot; was one of them. An early acoustic version of the song was created and can be heard in the background during a scene of the film. Citizen Dick&#x27;s song &quot;Touch Me, I&#x27;m Dick&quot; is a parody of the song &quot;Touch Me, I&#x27;m Sick&quot; by the Seattle band Mudhoney. On the inside cover photo of the , there is a Citizen Dick CD with the track listing on the CD itself. One of the songs is called &quot;Louder Than Larry (Steiner)&quot;, a wordplay on the Soundgarden album, &quot;Louder Than Love&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Singles&quot; holds a 79% critical approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 52 reviews with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads &quot;Smart, funny, and engagingly scruffy, &quot;Singles&quot; is a clear-eyed look at modern romance that doubles as a credible grunge-era time capsule&quot;.

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was complimentary, giving &quot;Singles&quot; three out of four stars and declaring it &quot;not a great cutting-edge movie, and parts of it may be too whimsical and disorganized for audiences raised on cause-and-effect plots[... but] I found myself smiling a lot during the movie, sometimes with amusement, sometimes with recognition. It&#x27;s easy to like these characters, and care about them.&quot; Tim Appelo wrote in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;With[...] an ambling, naturalistic style, Crowe captures the eccentric appeal of a town where espresso carts sprout on every corner and kids in ratty flannel shirts can cut records that make them millionaires.&quot; Meanwhile, Seattle&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot; was less kind to Crowe&#x27;s use of the local background, reviewing &quot;he&#x27;s relying on the general hipness of our little burg and on the star power of a few local musicians/bit actors to make a bundle of dough, and he hasn&#x27;t bothered to back them up with anything worth remembering. &quot;Pleasant&quot; is about the only word I can think of to describe the thing.&quot;

Warner Bros. Television immediately tried to turn &quot;Singles&quot; into a television series. Crowe claims that &quot;Singles &quot;inspired the television series &quot;Friends&quot;.

On July 5, 2015, Derek Erdman held a public screening of the movie in the courtyard of Capitol Hill&#x27;s Coryell Court Apartments—the building in which some of the main characters live. The event was attended by over 1,000 people. Despite initial concerns by the landlord, the event progressed smoothly. The crowd was respectful and cleaned up after themselves. Reports of Bridget Fonda being in attendance were false, but her auntJane Fondawas indeed there.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated

== Soundtrack ==

The &quot;Singles&quot; was released on June 30, 1992, through Epic Records and became a best seller three months before the release of the film. The soundtrack included music from key bands from the grunge music scene of the time, such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Pearl Jam performed two previously-unreleased songs on the soundtrack: &quot;Breath&quot; and &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot;. The Soundgarden song &quot;Birth Ritual&quot; and Chris Cornell&#x27;s solo song &quot;Seasons&quot; appear on the soundtrack. Paul Westerberg of The Replacements contributed two songs to the soundtrack and provided the score for the film. The Smashing Pumpkins also contributed to the soundtrack with the song &quot;Drown&quot;.

<doc id="577664" wikidata="Q6603389" url="?curid=577664" title="List of V Bomber dispersal bases">
<text>In its early years, the British V bomber force relied on the concept of aircraft dispersal to escape the effects of an enemy attack on their main bases. There were 22 such bases in 1962, in addition to the ten main bases a total of 32 bases available for the V bomber force.

In times of heightened international tension the V bomber force, already loaded with their nuclear weapons, could be flown to the dispersal bases where they could be kept at a few minutes readiness to take-off. The bases were situated around the United Kingdom in such a way that a nuclear strike by an attacking state could not be guaranteed to knock out all of Britain&#x27;s ability to retaliate. However, except during exercises, the dispersal bases, capable of taking two to four aircraft each, were never used. During the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan declined to order the dispersal of the V-Force because he believed the Soviets would view this as provocative. The bombers were instead held at 15-minute readiness at their main bases.

The dispersal bases are mentioned in the opening titles of the 1965 Peter Watkins documentary &quot;The War Game&quot;.

==Types==

Dispersal types include:

* Operational Readiness Platform (ORP): Usually a group of 4 aircraft pans attached to the runway where aircraft can taxi in and out without the use of a tug
* Dispersal Airfield: Group of 4 aircraft pans where aircraft can taxi in and out without the use of a tug, usually with additional support buildings
* Home Station &quot;H&quot;: Group of 4 aircraft pans in the shape of the letter &quot;H&quot; where aircraft cannot taxi in and out without the use of a tug
* Home Station Looped &quot;H&quot;: Group of 4 aircraft pans in the shape of the letter &quot;H&quot; where aircraft can taxi in and out without the use of a tug, usually with additional support buildings

<text>Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (14 February 1869 – 15 November 1959) was a Scottish meteorologist and physicist who shared the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics with Arthur Compton for his invention of the cloud chamber.

== Education and early life==
Wilson was born in the parish of Glencorse, Midlothian to Annie Clark Harper and John Wilson, a sheep farmer. After his father died in 1873, he moved with his family to Manchester. With financial support from his step-brother he studied biology at Owens College, now the University of Manchester, with the intent of becoming a doctor. In 1887, he graduated from the college with a BSc. He won a scholarship to attend Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he became interested in physics and chemistry. In 1892 he received 1st class honours in both parts of the Natural Science Tripos.

==Career==
He became particularly interested in meteorology, and in 1893 he began to study clouds and their properties. Beginning in 1894, he worked for some time at the observatory on Ben Nevis, where he made observations of cloud formation. He was particularly fascinated by the appearance of glories. He then tried to reproduce this effect on a smaller scale at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, expanding humid air within a sealed container.

In 1895 he discovered that at a large enough expansion ratio supersaturated water vapour condensates even without dust which he removed by previous condensations, contrary to the previous research by John Aitken. Under J. J. Thomson&#x27;s mentorship by 1896 he found out that X-rays stimulate the condensation just as well as dust.

He later experimented with the creation of cloud trails in his chamber by condensation onto ions generated by radioactivity. Several of his cloud chambers survive.

Wilson was made Fellow of Sidney Sussex College, and University Lecturer and Demonstrator in 1900. He was known by some as a poor lecturer, due to a pronounced stutter, but he did teach a course on atmospheric electricity as a visiting lecturer at Imperial College London.

In 1906 he hypothesized that cosmic radiation might generate the ions causing condensation without apparent reasons.

== Contributions ==
The invention of the cloud chamber was by far Wilson&#x27;s signature accomplishment, earning him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927. The Cavendish laboratory praised him for the creation of &quot;a novel and striking method of investigating the properties of ionized gases&quot;. The cloud chamber allowed huge experimental leaps forward in the study of subatomic particles and the field of particle physics, generally. Some have credited Wilson with making the study of particles possible at all.

Wilson published numerous papers on meteorology and physics, on topics including X-rays, ionization, thundercloud formation, and other meteorological events. Wilson may also have observed a sprite in 1924, 65 years before their official discovery. Weather was a focus of his work throughout his career, from his early observations at Ben Nevis to his final paper, on thunderclouds.

== Method ==
Retrospectively, Wilson&#x27;s experimental method has received some attention from scholars.

In a period of scientific inquiry characterized by a divide between &quot;analytical&quot; and &quot;morphological&quot; scientists, Wilson&#x27;s method of inquiry represented a hybrid. While some scientists believed phenomena should be observed in pure nature, others proposed laboratory-controlled experiments as the premier method for inquiry. Wilson used a combination of methods in his experiments and investigations. Wilson&#x27;s work &quot;made things visible whose properties had only previously been deduced indirectly&quot;.

He has been called &quot;almost the last of the great individual experimenters in physics&quot;. He used his cloud chamber in various ways to demonstrate the operating principles of things like subatomic particles and X-rays. But his primary interest, and the subject of the bulk of his papers, was meteorology.

== Awards, honours and legacy ==

Wilson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1900.


For the invention of the cloud chamber he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. He shared this prize with the American physicist Arthur Compton, rewarded for his work on the particle nature of radiation. Despite Wilson&#x27;s great contribution to particle physics, he remained interested in atmospheric physics, specifically atmospheric electricity, for his entire career.
For example, his last research paper, published in 1956 when he was in his late eighties (at that time he was the oldest FRS to publish a paper in the Royal Society&#x27;s journals), was on atmospheric electricity.

The Wilson crater on the Moon is named after him, Alexander Wilson and Ralph Elmer Wilson. The Wilson Condensation Cloud formations that occur after large explosions, such as nuclear detonations, are named after him. The Wilson Society, the scientific society of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge is named in his honour, as is the CTR Wilson Institute for Atmospheric Electricity, the Atmospheric Electricity Special Interest Group of the Royal Meteorological Society.

The archives of C.T.R. Wilson are maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow.

in 1996, a blue plaque in Wilson&#x27;s honour was installed in a specially built cairn at Flotterstone, close to his birthplace at Crosshouse Farm.

In 2012, the Royal Society of Edinburgh held a meeting in honour of Wilson, the &quot;Great Scottish Physicist&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1908, Wilson married Jessie Fraser, the daughter of a minister from Glasgow. The couple had four children. His family knew him as patient and curious, and fond of taking walks in the hills near his home. He died at his home in Carlops on 15 November 1959, surrounded by his family.

<text>The Faroe Islands elects on the national level a legislature. The Faroese Parliament (&quot;Løgtingið in Faroese&quot;) has 33 members of parliament, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation. The Faroe Islands have a multi-party system (disputing on independence and unionism as well as left and right), with numerous parties in which a single party normally does not have a chance of gaining power alone, and therefore the parties must work together in order to form a coalition government.

<text>Flavius Claudius Constantius Gallus (326 – 354) was a statesman and ruler in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire from 351 to 354, as &quot;Caesar&quot; under emperor Constantius II (), his cousin. A grandson of emperor Constantius Chlorus () and empress Flavia Maximiana Theodora, and a son of Julius Constantius and Galla, he belonged to the Constantinian dynasty. Born during the reign of his uncle Constantine the Great (), he was among the few male members of the imperial family to survive the purge that followed Constantine&#x27;s death. Under Constantius II, Gallus served as deputy emperor, based in Antioch and married to Constantius&#x27; sister Constantina. He dealt with a Jewish revolt in the years 351-352. Gallus ultimately fell out of favor with Constantius and was executed, being replaced as &quot;Caesar&quot; by his younger half-brother Julian.

== Family ==
Gallus was a son of Julius Constantius and his first wife Galla, who seems to have died at some point prior to 331/2. Gallus&#x27; paternal grandparents were the emperor Constantius Chlorus and his second wife Flavia Maximiana Theodora. Julius Constantius was a paternal half-brother of the emperor Constantine I, which, in turn, meant Gallus was a half-first cousin of Constantine&#x27;s sons, Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans.

Gallus had three siblings: his elder sister, of unknown name, was the first wife of Constantius II, and his elder brother, also of unknown name, died in the purges after the death of Constantine I. His younger half-brother, by his father&#x27;s second marriage to Basilina, was Flavius Claudius Iulianus, commonly known as Julian.
== Youth ==
Gallus was born in &quot;Massa Veternensis&quot;, Italia, after his father had been recalled from exile. Gallus&#x27; father and his elder brother were amongst those killed during the purges that occurred in the imperial family after the death of Constantine I in 337. Gallus himself was one of the only imperial males – besides the three sons of Constantine I and Fausta – who were not killed; the others being Gallus&#x27; younger half-brother, Julian, and their cousin, Nepotianus, each of whom was very young at the time.

Gallus was said by Ammianus Marcellinus to have been very good looking, making particular note of his soft blond hair.

There is debate over where Gallus spent his youth. One view is that he lived with Julian in Nicomedia under the care of bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia until 340. At that point, Eusebius was made bishop of Constantinople, which necessitated Gallus and Julian following him there. It is believed that, after the death of Eusebius in 341, Constantius then sent Gallus and Julian to continue their studies at the imperial household in Macellum, Cappadocia. An alternative view claims that hints in the sources suggest that Gallus was sent to Ephesus to study, then to a type of exile in Tralles and from there to the imperial household in Macellum.
== Caesar ==

In 350, Magnentius rebelled and killed the emperor Constans, claiming the purple. Constantius II prepared to move against the usurper, but needed a representative in the East, so he called Gallus at Sirmium, raised him to the rank of caesar (15 March 351), gave him the name &quot;Constantius&quot;, and strengthened the bonds with his cousin by allowing Gallus to marry his sister Constantina. The two set up residence in Antioch.

During his rule, Gallus had to deal with a Jewish rebellion in Judea/Palestine (see Jewish revolt against Gallus) led by Patricius and Isaac of Diocesarea. The rebellion, possibly started before Gallus&#x27; elevation to Caesar, was crushed by Gallus&#x27; general, Ursicinus, who ordered all the rebels slain.

Gallus was saved from an assassination plot by a woman, who revealed that some members of her household were planning the murder. Some sources, among whom are Joannes Zonaras, claim that this plot had been organized by Magnentius in order to distract Constantius.

Philostorgius claims that Gallus&#x27; generals won a campaign against the Sassanids. Other sources, basing their views on an almost-peaceful situation between the Sassanids and Romans while Shapur II was engaged in a campaign against the Huns in the east, dismiss this claim. Ammianus relays an abortive scheme of Nohodares, Shapur&#x27;s lieutenant in Mesopotamia, to surprise the town of Batnae, which was betrayed by some in his own army, in 353. In the same year, Gallus sent the &quot;comes Orientis&quot;, Nebridius, against the Isaurians, who had been raiding the coastal provinces, and were now besieging Seleucia on the Calycadnus. They dispersed on his approach.

As a consequence of the need to gather food for the troops for a Persian campaign or because of drought, the grain supply in Antioch decreased. In order to counter the higher price of grain, Gallus forced the passage of some laws regardless of the opinion of the Senate, thus alienating the senatorial class of Antioch. Ammianus Marcellinus, a pro-senatorial writer, tells how the anger of the people of Antioch for the famine was diverted by Gallus towards the &quot;consularis Syriae&quot; Theophilus, who was killed by the mob.

Ammianus reports also that Gallus and Constantina brought a number of wealthy people to trial for magic, ending in the execution of innocents and in the confiscation of their wealth. The same source claims that Gallus walked anonymously in Antioch by night, asking passers-by for their opinion on their &quot;caesar&quot;, while Julian records the great amount of time spent by Gallus at the Hippodrome, probably to obtain popular support.

Doubting his cousin&#x27;s loyalty, Constantius reduced the troops under Gallus, and sent the Praetorian Prefect Domitianus to Antioch to urge Gallus to go to Italy. Different sources tell different stories, but all agree that Gallus arrested Domitianus and the &quot;quaestor&quot; Montius Magnus who had come to his aid, and that the two officers were killed.

The arrest of Montius Magnus led to the discovery of what seems to be a plot to usurp Gallus&#x27; position. The conspirators had the support of two &quot;tribuni fabricarum&quot; (officers of the weapons factories) who had promised the weapons for an uprising (Ammianus Marcellinus, 14.7.18), and probably of the troops in Mesopotamia, as well as of the rector of the province of Phoenice. All suspected in connection with the plot, including many innocents, were put to death by order of the Caesar.

==Fall and death ==
Constantius was informed of the treason trials in Antioch during a campaign against the Alamanni. After concluding a peace treaty with the Germanic tribe, Constantius decided to settle the matter with his cousin. First he summoned Ursicinus to the West, whom he suspected of inciting Gallus in order to create the occasion for a revolt and the usurpation of his own son.

Next, Constantius summoned Gallus and Constantina to Mediolanum. Constantina left first, in order to gain some of her brother&#x27;s trust, but suddenly died from a fever at Caeni Gallicani in Bithynia. Gallus, whose bonds to Constantius had been weakened, stayed in Antioch. Constantius tried to lure Gallus, sending the &quot;tribunus scutariorum&quot; Scudilo to tell Gallus that Constantius wanted to raise him to &quot;Augustus&quot;. Gallus took Constantius&#x27;s bait and left Antioch to meet him. Gallus staged a chariot race in Constantinople&#x27;s &quot;Hippodrome&quot; and crowned the victor, an honor reserved only for an Augustus. This insolence enraged Constantius. In an attempt to further isolate Gallus from any form of military protection, Constantius had the garrisons removed from the towns in Gallus&#x27;s path.

When Gallus arrived at Poetovio in Noricum, Barbatio, an officer who had been supporting Gallus&#x27; dismissal within Constantius&#x27; court, surrounded the palace of the Caesar and arrested him, stripping Gallus of the imperial robes, but assuring him that no harm would come to him. Gallus was led to Pola, Istria (now Pula, Croatia). Here he was interrogated by some of the highest officials of Constantius&#x27; court, including the eunuch &quot;praepositus sacri cubiculi&quot; Eusebius and the &quot;agens in rebus&quot; Apodemius. Gallus tried to put the blame for all of his actions on Constantina, but Constantius sentenced him to death; the emperor later changed his mind, and ordered Gallus spared, but Eusebius prevented the order from reaching the executioners.

<text>Patrick Benguigui (; born 14 May 1959), better known by his stage name Patrick Bruel (), is a French singer-songwriter, actor and professional poker player.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Patrick is the son of Pierre Benguigui and Augusta Kammoun, daughter of Elie and Céline ben Sidoun. He lived in the staff accommodation of the girls&#x27; school in Argenteuil where his mother was a teacher. In his youth, Bruel aspired to be a football player, but decided instead to pursue singing after seeing Michel Sardou in 1975.

=== Acting and music careers ===
His first success came as an actor, in 1979&#x27;s &quot;Le Coup de sirocco&quot;. He continued acting in films, on television, and in the theater while pursuing his singing career. His first single, &quot;Vide&quot; (&quot;Empty&quot;), released in 1982, was not a success, but the follow-up, &quot;Marre de cette nana-là&quot; (&quot;Fed up with that chick&quot;), was a hit.

In 2003, just before his partner, the writer and playwright Amanda Sthers, gave birth to his first child, Oscar, on 19 August, he changed his name to Bruel-Benguigui, combining his stage name with his birth name. On 21 September 2004, he wed the then 26-year-old Sthers; it was his first marriage. His second child, Léon, was born on 28 September 2005. The couple separated in 2007.

As of 2004, Bruel has acted in more than forty television and film productions, and has made five studio albums and several live albums. In 2002, Bruel released &quot;Entre Deux&quot;, a double CD of classic chanson that features duets with Charles Aznavour, Jean-Louis Aubert, Jean-Jacques Goldman, Alain Souchon and Renaud, among others. It sold two million copies and made Bruel France&#x27;s best paid singer of the year. At the beginning of 2005, in response to the South Asian tsunami of 26 December 2004, Bruel wrote the song &quot;Et puis la terre&quot; with Marie-Florence Gros, with whom he had begun a long-term collaboration in 1998, to benefit the Red Cross. His latest album, &quot;Des souvenirs devant&quot;, was his fourth chart-topper in France.

=== Poker ===
Bruel is a world-class professional poker player. He won a World Series of Poker bracelet in 1998 for the $5,000 Limit Hold&#x27;em event. As of 2009, he has earned more than $900,000 in tournament play, of which his ten cash winnings at the WSOP account for $411,659. He also comments on the World Poker Tour in France.
===World Series of Poker bracelet===

===Los Angeles home===
In the 2010s, Bruel bought a house in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. In January 2025, the house was destroyed by the Palisades Fire.

==Philanthropy==
Bruel has been a member of the Les Enfoirés charity ensemble since 1993.

<text>Hugh Borton (May 14, 1903 – August 6, 1995) was an American historian who specialized in the history of Japan, later serving as president of Haverford College.

== Biography ==
Borton was born on May 14, 1903, to a devout Quaker household in Moorestown Township, New Jersey. His parents sent him to Quaker schools and after graduating from Haverford College in 1927, he and his wife Elizabeth Wilbur, proceeded to find a way of making a living that was in line with their Quaker beliefs. They looked to the American Friends Service Committee, which set up teaching posts for them at a small school in the foothills of the Tennessee’s Great Smoky Mountains. In 1928 Borton and his wife were asked to travel to Tokyo, Japan, to help the Committee&#x27;s work there.

Borton&#x27;s three years living among the Japanese affected his outlook to the extent that he thereafter devoted himself to studying Japan. Initially, Borton sought guidance from Sir George Sansom, a British scholar who was then serving in the British Consulate. In 1931, Borton returned to America to further his education. He completed a master&#x27;s degree in history at Columbia University and studied briefly at Harvard University. He then traveled across the Atlantic to pursue further study under the supervision of Professors J. J. L. Duyvendak and Johannes Rahder at Leiden University in the Netherlands. He was awarded his PhD by Leiden after several years of work at Tokyo Imperial University. He returned to the United States to take a position on the faculty at Columbia, lecturing on modern Japanese history and language. He also played a key role in structuring the first undergraduate program in Japanese studies in the newly expanded Department of Chinese and Japanese. His research publications prior to the Second World War included &quot;Peasant Uprisings in Japan of the Tokugawa Period&quot; and &quot;Japan Since 1931: Its Political and Social Development&quot;.

Borton’s academic career was interrupted by America’s entry into the Second World War following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, diverting him into public service. Borton cited his Quaker principles in conscientiously objecting to serving in the armed forces, but he was interested in doing what he could to prepare for the peace after the war. In June 1942 he sought leave from Columbia to spend the summer serving on the faculty of the School of Military Government at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. In the fall he moved to the US State Department. It marked the beginning of six years during which he was in the midst of a corps of officials who focused not on the military advancement of the war, but in preparing peacetime measures not focused on punishing Japan, but on reforming it so that a similar war would be less likely to occur. Borton drafted many of the State Department proposals and was a proponent of many of its positions, including those that resulted in key decisions such as the decision not to prosecute Emperor Hirohito as a war criminal and the decision to not replace the Japanese government but to disband the Japanese military and replace the wartime leadership. His group also sought to implement fundamental reform of the Japanese constitution.

In 1948 Borton returned to academic life at Columbia, where he was a prominent organizer of the East Asian Institute as the University&#x27;s centre of modern and contemporary East Asian studies. He replaced the inaugural director, Sir George Sansom, and later helped to establish the Association for Asian Studies, serving as its first treasurer and later as its president. Among his works were &quot;Japan Under Allied Occupation, 1945–1947&quot; and &quot;Japan&#x27;s Modern Century&quot;, which went on to become one of the most widely used history texts of his period.

In 1957, Borton resigned his post at Columbia to accept an appointment to Haverford College as its president, before retiring in 1967. In 1972 he retired to his farm in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts to enjoy the farm life which he loved and to practice his Quaker faith. Borton died on August 6, 1995, at the age of 92 at his home in Conway, Massachusetts.

<text>William Alfred Fowler (August 9, 1911 March 14, 1995) was an American nuclear physicist, later astrophysicist, who, with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics. He is known for his theoretical and experimental research into nuclear reactions within stars and the energy elements produced in the process and was one of the authors of the influential BFH paper.

==Early life==
On 9 August 1911, Fowler was born in Pittsburgh. Fowler&#x27;s parents were John MacLeod Fowler and Jennie Summers Watson. Fowler was the eldest of his siblings, Arthur and Nelda.

The family moved to Lima, Ohio, a steam railroad town, when Fowler was two years old. Growing up near the Pennsylvania Railroad yard influenced Fowler&#x27;s interest in locomotives. In 1973, he travelled to the Soviet Union just to observe the steam engine that powered the Trans-Siberian Railway plying the nearly route that connects Khabarovsk and Moscow.

==Education==
In 1933, Fowler graduated from the Ohio State University, where he was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. In 1936, Fowler received a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.

==Career==
In 1936, Fowler became a research fellow at Caltech. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1938. In 1939, Fowler became an assistant professor at Caltech.

Although an experimental nuclear physicist, Fowler&#x27;s most famous paper was his collaboration with Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge, &quot;Synthesis of the Elements in Stars&quot; Significantly, Margaret Burbidge was first author, her husband Geoffrey Burbidge second, Fowler third, and Cambridge cosmologist Fred Hoyle. That 1957 paper in Reviews of Modern Physics categorized most nuclear processes for origin of all but the lightest chemical elements in stars. It is widely known as the BFH paper. Though the theory of Stellar Nucleosynthesis established in the paper was later cited by the Nobel Committee as the reason for Fowler&#x27;s 1983 Nobel in Physics, neither any of the Burbidges nor Hoyle shared in the award.

In 1942, Fowler became an associate professor at Caltech. In 1946, Fowler became a Professor at Caltech. Fowler, along with Lee A. DuBridge, Max Mason, Linus Pauling, and Bruce H. Sage, was awarded the Medal for Merit in 1948 by President Harry S. Truman.

Fowler succeeded Charles Lauritsen as director of the W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory at Caltech, and was himself later succeeded by Steven E. Koonin. Fowler was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Gerald Ford.

Fowler was Guggenheim Fellow at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1962–63. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1962, won the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society in 1963, elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965, won the Vetlesen Prize in 1973, the Eddington Medal in 1978, the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1979, and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983 (shared with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar) for his theoretical and experimental studies of the nuclear reactions of importance in the formation of the chemical elements in the universe .

Fowler&#x27;s doctoral students at Caltech included Donald D. Clayton.

==Personal life==
A lifelong fan of steam locomotives, Fowler owned several working models of various sizes.

Fowler&#x27;s first wife was Adriane Fay (née Olmsted) Fowler (1912–1988). They had two daughters, Mary Emily and Martha.

In December 1989, Fowler married Mary Dutcher (1919–2019), an artist, in Pasadena, California.
On 11 March 1995, Fowler died from kidney failure in Pasadena, California. He was 83.

<doc id="577687" wikidata="Q909366" url="?curid=577687" title="Saburō Ienaga">
<text>was a Japanese historian. In 1953, the Japanese Ministry of Education published a textbook by Ienaga, but censored what they said were factual errors and matters of opinion, regarding Japanese war crimes. Ienaga undertook a series of lawsuits against the Ministry for violation of his freedom of speech. He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999 and 2001 by Noam Chomsky among others. He also recorded the history of the Japanese resistance in World War II in his book &quot;The Pacific War, 1931–1945&quot;.

==Life==
Ienaga was born in Nagoya. He entered Tokyo&#x27;s Kudan High School in 1926, and graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1937. Following his graduation, he served as a professor at Tokyo University of Education (東京教育大, today&#x27;s University of Tsukuba) from 1949 to 1977, and at Chuo University from 1977 to 1984.
 In 1984, he was awarded the Japan Academy Prize and became professor emeritus at Tokyo University of Education.

==Background of the lawsuit==
In April 1947, Ienaga published &quot;New Japanese History&quot; (新日本史) as a general history book. Upon request from Sanseidō, Ienaga wrote a draft of a Japanese history textbook for high school based on his &quot;New Japanese History.&quot; The draft was, however, rejected by the Ministry of Education at the school textbook authorization of 1952. The reasons for rejection included such grounds as the claim that the description of the High Treason Incident (大逆事件) was not appropriate, and that the draft did not clarify the fact that the Russo-Japanese War was supported by the Japanese people. Ienaga reapplied for authorization without any alterations, and the draft somehow passed authorization and was published as a textbook for the school year of 1953, under the same title, &quot;New Japanese History&quot;.

After wholly revising the first edition of the textbook, Ienaga applied again for authorization of the textbook in 1955. The draft passed authorization on the condition that 216 items in the draft be altered. The Ministry of Education demanded that Ienaga correct the suggested elements two times subsequently. Ienaga made several alterations, but refused several others. The revised &quot;New Japanese History&quot; was published in 1956. After the curriculum guidelines (学習指導要領) for high school social studies changed in 1955, Ienaga applied for authorization for the third and fourth editions of his textbook in November 1956 and May 1957. They went through the same process as the 1955 edition and were authorized for publication in 1959 and 1962 respectively.

==First lawsuit==

On June 12, 1965, Ienaga filed the first suit against the government of Japan. He demanded ¥1,000,000 () under the State Redress Law (国家賠償法) for the psychological damage that he suffered from the government&#x27;s allegedly unconstitutional system of school textbook authorization making him correct the contents of his draft textbook against his will and violating his right to freedom of expression. Ienaga claimed that the system of textbook authorization, which is based on Articles 21 and 51 of the School Education Law (学校教育法) among others, was unjust and unconstitutional because:
The authorization system was against Article 21 of the constitution that guarantees the freedom of speech and expression. Writing and publication of history textbook is a form of speech that is protected by the Constitution; however, the system of school textbook authorization as it was practiced in 1965 conducted thought control and prohibited publication and use of textbooks at schools that were deemed inappropriate according to a particular political ideology held by the government. According to Ienaga this falls under the category of censorship (検閲) that is prohibited by Section 2, Article 21 of the Constitution of Japan. Article 21 specifically prohibits censorship in an independent section because it is the principle of the democratic constitution of Japan that the people are guaranteed the opportunities to freely enjoy the results of scholastic researches, be exposed to all sorts of ideas and opinions, and know socio-political reality and historical truth through various media such as press, radio, and television.

The authorization system was against Article 10 of Fundamental Law of Education (教育基本法) that states that education shall not submit to unjust control. This is from reflection on the past that the pre-war education system of Japan attempted to control thought by standardizing and uniforming education. Therefore, the content of education ought to be left unstandardized and be free from uniformalization by the political authority, Ienaga argued.
At the first trial (filed by Ienaga on June 12, 1965, ruled on July 16, 1974, at Tokyo District Court), Judge Takatsu ruled that the textbook authorization system could not be deemed censorship as defined in the Article 21 of the Constitution because such a system should be allowed on the ground of public welfare, while ordering the state to compensate Ienaga 100,000 yen for a certain abuse of discretion.

At the second trial (filed by Ienaga on July 26, 1974, ruled on March 19, 1986, at Tokyo High Court), Judge Suzuki wholly adopted the claim of the state and denied any abuse of discretion in the authorization process.

At the third trial (filed by Ienaga on March 20, 1986, ruled on March 16, 1993, at Supreme Court), Judge Kabe followed the verdict of the second trial and rejected the appeal.

==Second lawsuit==

Ienaga filed an administrative lawsuit to demand the Ministry of Education to reverse the rejection of his &quot;New Japanese History&quot; at the textbook authorization in 1966.

At the first trial (filed by Ienaga on June 12, 1965, ruled on July 16, 1974, at Tokyo District Court), Judge Sugimoto ruled that authorization that affects the content of the description of textbooks is against Article 10 of the Fundamental Law of Education, and that the authorization falls under the category of censorship as defined in Section 2, Article 21 of the Constitution, and demanded the state reverse its decision.
At the second trial (filed by the state on July 24, 1970, ruled on December 20, 1975, at Tokyo High Court), Judge Azakami rejected the appeal by the state on the ground that the decision of the authorization lacks consistency.

At the third trial (filed by the state on December 30, 1975, ruled on April 8, 1982, at Supreme Court), the Supreme Court reversed and remanded the appeal to the high court as the curriculum guideline had already been revised since the time of the first lawsuit and as the result there is no longer any merit in requesting reversal of Ministry&#x27;s decision.

At the fourth trial (ruled on June 27, 1989, at Tokyo High Court), the judge rejected the ruling of the first trial since the plaintiff has already lost interest in requesting the reversal of the rejection of his textbook.

==Third lawsuit==

Ienaga filed a suit against the government of Japan to demand state compensation for the result of textbook authorization in 1982 that rejected his draft textbook.

At the first trial (filed by Ienaga on January 1, 1984, ruled on October 3, 1989, at Tokyo District Court), Judge Kato ruled that while the authorization system itself was constitutional, there was a certain abuse of discretion on the part of the Ministry regarding the unconstitutional censoring of the description of &quot;sōmōtai&quot; (草莽隊), and ordered the state to compensate Ienaga 100,000 yen.

At the second trial (filed by the state on October 13, 1989, ruled on October 20, 1993, at Tokyo High Court), Judge Kawakami ruled that while the authorization system itself was constitutional, there was a certain abuse of discretion on the part of the Ministry regarding the unconstitutional censoring of the descriptions of Nanking Massacre and sexual assaults by the military in addition to &quot;sōmōtai&quot;, and ordered the state to compensate Ienaga 300,000 yen.

At the third trial (filed by Ienaga on October 25, 1993, ruled on August 29, 1997, at Supreme Court), Judge Ono ruled that while the authorization system itself was constitutional, there was a certain abuse of discretion on the part of the Ministry regarding the unconstitutional censoring of the descriptions of Unit 731, sexual assaults at Nanking in addition to &quot;sōmōtai&quot;, and ordered the state to pay Ienaga 400,000 yen as compensation.

<text>NEWater (pronounced New-Water) is the brand name given to highly treated reclaimed wastewater produced by Singapore&#x27;s Public Utilities Board. NEWater is produced by further purifying conventionally treated wastewater through microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet 
radiation. The water is potable quality and can be added to drinking water supply reservoirs where it is withdrawn and treated again in conventional water treatment plants before being distributed to consumers. However, most NEWater is currently used for non-drinking purposes, mostly by industries with production requirements for high purity water.

==History==
Singapore considered water recycling to augment its limited fresh water supply starting in the 1970s. A Master Plan drafted in 1972 identified water reclamation and desalination as alternatives to reduce dependence on imported water from Malaysia. Subsequently, an experimental water reclamation treatment plant was built in 1974, but the operation was terminated after only one year due to costs and reliability issues.

In 1998, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) initiated the Singapore Water Reclamation Study (NEWater Study). The aim was to determine if NEWater was a viable source of raw water for Singapore&#x27;s needs. NEWater and desalination both were explored to reduce reliance on water imported from Malaysia, which has long been a source of friction between the Malaysian and Singapore governments. The Malaysian government is treaty-bound to sell water to Singapore until 2061, but it has no obligation to do so after that date.

In 2001, PUB initiated efforts to identify non-potable uses of water. NEWater, because of its high quality, became the supply of choice for industry demands. This use provided an outlet for this new water supply without increasing the demand on the limited potable water supply.

The PUB launched NEWater to the public in 2003, with the opening of the first two NEWater plants - the Bedok and Kranji plants - as well as the NEWater Visitor Centre. In anticipation of the potential public concerns over the safety of recycled water, NEWater was carefully implemented. The PUB was cautious in its usage of terms, avoiding terms such as &#x27;wastewater&#x27; or &#x27;sewage&#x27; that carried a negative connotation. Sewage treatment plants were renamed to &#x27;water reclamation plants&#x27; and sewage or wastewater were referred to as &#x27;used water&#x27;. This contributed to a positive framing of NEWater, enhancing public acceptance of reused water. In addition, the government extensively engaged the public through exhibitions and advertisements to educate them about NEWater. The NEWater Visitor Centre, which allows people to view the NEWater treatment process, was also opened to enhance visitors&#x27; understanding of how NEWater is produced. These public engagement efforts were aimed at correcting any misunderstandings people might have towards recycled water and increasing public support for reused water.

Also, innovative technologies which was promoted by international industries applied on NEWater, such as LG Chem and DuPont in its reverse osmosis technologies.

==Production==
The first NEWater plant was completed in May 2000. Singapore currently has four operational NEWater factories, at Bedok, Kranji, Ulu Pandan and Changi. The Bedok and Kranji factories were commissioned in 2002, the Ulu Pandan plant in March 2007 and the Changi plant in August 2009. A plant at Seletar, commissioned in February 2004, was closed in 2011, as the PUB implemented its plan to centralize the treatment of used water, under the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System. In January 2017, a new NEWater plant was launched at Changi, and is the first plant to be jointly developed by a foreign and local company.

The Bedok and Kranji plants are operated by the Public Utilities Board, while the Ulu Pandan and Changi plants are under DBOO concessions by Keppel Seghers and Sembcorp Industries.

There is a Visitor Centre in the NEWater factory in Bedok, near the Singapore Expo Tanah Merah MRT station. The visitor centre was awarded the Best Sightseeing/Leisure/Educational Programme at the 20th Tourism Awards 2005 and the IWA Marketing &amp; Communication Award in 2006.

The visitor centre provides multiple free programmes to educate the public regarding the technologies and production of NEWater:

* NEWater Scientist Program – Students take on the role of NEWater Scientists and explore the visitor centre
* Outdoor Classroom – Host fun activities and experiments that help students learn about reverse osmosis and other NEWater processes
* Water Ambassadors – Small workshops that teach uniformed groups (i.e. National Cadet Corps and Scouts Association) skills to be water ambassadors

===Procedure===
NEWater source water comes from effluent of secondary sewage treatment plants. The effluent passes through a multiple-barrier water reclamation process:

* The first stage of the NEWater production process uses microfiltration/ultrafiltration to remove suspended solids, colloidal particles, disease-causing bacteria, some viruses and protozoan cysts. The filtered water after passing through the membrane contains only dissolved salts and organic molecules.
* The second stage of the NEWater production process uses reverse osmosis (RO). A semi-permeable membrane filters out contaminants such as bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, nitrates, chlorides, sulfates, disinfection by-products, aromatic hydrocarbons, and pesticides. NEWater is thus free from viruses and bacteria and contains very low levels of salts and organic matter. At this stage, the water is of potable quality.
* The third stage of the NEWater production process is a safety precaution. UV disinfection is used to ensure that all organisms are inactivated and the purity of the water can be guaranteed. After adding some alkaline chemicals to restore the pH balance, NEWater is ready for use.

Since 2002, there have been pilot programs to consider replacing the activated sludge process of the secondary sewage treatment and the microfiltration/ultrafiltration stage of the NEWater with a membrane bioreactor process.

==Applications==
The total capacity of the plants is about . About 6% of this is used for indirect potable use, equal to about 1% of Singapore&#x27;s potable water requirement of . The rest is used at wafer fabrication plants and other non-potable applications in industries in Woodlands, Tampines, Pasir Ris, and Ang Mo Kio.

Government figures show that the country&#x27;s NEWater plans can meet up to 40% of Singapore&#x27;s current needs, and the figure is expected to go up to 55% by 2060.

===Potability===
The quality of NEWater consistently exceeds the requirements set by USEPA and WHO guidelines and is cleaner than other water sources in Singapore.

The following table compares the water quality of NEWater to the WHO and USEPA standards.

<text>The United Aircraft and Transport Corporation was formed in 1929, when William Boeing of Boeing Airplane &amp; Transport Corporation teamed up with Frederick Rentschler of Pratt &amp; Whitney to form a large, vertically-integrated, amalgamated firm, uniting business interests in all aspects of aviation—a combination of airframe and aircraft engine manufacturing and airline business, to serve all aviation markets, both civil aviation (cargo, passenger, private, air mail) and military aviation.

The holding company controlled the stock of several aviation manufacturing companies, including the Boeing Airplane Company, Northrop Aircraft Corporation, Chance Vought Corporation, Hamilton Aero Manufacturing Company, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Company, Sikorsky Aviation Corporation, and Stearman Aircraft Company. At its founding, the company initially controlled three airlines, Boeing Air Transport, Pacific Air Transport, and Stout Air Services. Other United Operations included the Boeing School of Aeronautics, United Aircraft Exports, United Airports Company of California, which built Burbank Airport, and the United Airports of Connecticut, which built factories in East Hartford for Pratt &amp; Whitney and Chance Vought. The first annual report lists William Boeing as chairman, Frederick Rentschler as president, and Chance M. Vought, Philip G. Johnson, and George Wheat as vice presidents.

The Standard Steel Propeller Company were added to United&#x27;s portfolio shortly thereafter, followed by two airlines in 1930, Varney Air Lines and National Air Transport. The airline interests were soon grouped under a new management company known as United Air Lines, Inc. However, the individual airlines (as well as the individual companies held by United) continued to operate under their own names.

After the Air Mail scandal of 1934, the U.S. government concluded that such large holding companies as United Aircraft and Transport were anti-competitive, and new antitrust laws were passed forbidding airframe or aircraft engine manufacturers from having interests in airlines. This law forced United Aircraft and Transport to split into three separate companies. The company&#x27;s eastern manufacturing companies (Pratt &amp; Whitney, Sikorsky, Vought, and Hamilton Standard) were spun off into a new holding company, United Aircraft Corporation (later United Technologies Corporation, then RTX Corporation), which remained headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut, with Rentschler as president. The western manufacturing interests (including Northrop, formerly Avion Corporation), became Boeing Airplane Company, headquartered in Seattle. The airline interests were merged into a single company, United Air Lines, Inc., headquartered in Chicago.

<text>Maia Chiburdanidze (; born 17 January 1961) is a Georgian chess Grandmaster. She is the sixth Women&#x27;s World Chess Champion, a title she held from 1978 to 1991, and was the youngest one until 2010, when this record was broken by Hou Yifan. Chiburdanidze is the second woman to be awarded the title of Grandmaster by FIDE, which took place in 1984. She has played on nine gold-medal-winning teams in the Women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad.

==Early life and career==
Maia Chiburdanidze was born in Kutaisi, Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, USSR, and started playing chess around the age of eight. She became the USSR girls&#x27; champion in 1976, and a year later she won the women&#x27;s title. In 1977, Chiburdanidze was awarded the title of Woman Grandmaster by FIDE.

Chiburdanidze won outright on her debut, at the Braşov women&#x27;s international tournament of 1974, when she was only 13 years old and went on to win another tournament in Tbilisi in 1975 before entering the women&#x27;s world championship cycle of 1976/77.

Chiburdanidze&#x27;s style of play is solid, but aggressive and well grounded in classical principles; it was influenced by Eduard Gufeld, a top Soviet trainer, who was her coach early in her career.

== Women&#x27;s World Champion (1978–91) ==
Chiburdanidze finished second in the Tbilisi Women&#x27;s Interzonal (1976), thereby qualifying for the 1977 candidates matches. She advanced through to the Candidates Final, where she beat Alla Kushnir by 7½–6½ to set up a world title match in Pitsunda, Georgia, against Nona Gaprindashvili, the reigning women&#x27;s world champion. Chiburdanidze defeated Gaprindashvili by 8½–6½. 

She successfully defended her title four times. In 1981, Chiburdanidze retained her title by drawing 8–8 with Nana Alexandria, in Borjomi/Tbilisi. Three years later, she played Irina Levitina in Volgograd, Russia, and won 8½–5½. The next defense came against Elena Akhmilovskaya in Sofia in 1986, which Chiburdanidze won 8½–5½. In 1988 she beat Nana Ioseliani in Telavi, Georgia, by 8½–7½.

FIDE awarded Chiburdanidze the title of Grandmaster in 1984. She is the second woman, after Gaprindashvili, to be awarded the title.

== Losing the title ==

Xie Jun of China won the right to challenge for the world championship in February 1991. Chiburdanidze lost her crown to the young Chinese player in Manila by 8½–6½. Her reign was the third longest, at 13 years, behind only that of the first women&#x27;s champion, Vera Menchik, who reigned for 17 years from 1927 until her death in 1944, and Gaprindashvili&#x27;s 16 years.

Chiburdanidze has attempted to regain the world title but, with the rise of the Chinese women and the formidable Polgár sisters, this has proved difficult and her best performance since 1991 has been first in the Tilburg Candidates tournament of 1994, losing the playoff to Zsuzsa Polgár by 5½–1½. Subsequently, despite not approving of the knockout format, she has entered the world championships of recent years. She reached the semi-finals in 2001, only to be knocked out by Zhu Chen of China, who went on to win the title. In 2004, Chiburdanidze again reached the semi-finals, where she lost to Antoaneta Stefanova, who went on to win the title.

==Other chess achievements==
Chiburdanidze is unimpressed with &#x27;women&#x27;s chess&#x27;, and hopes for a time when there will be no need for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments. She has played extensively in &quot;men&#x27;s&quot; tournaments around the world and her best form was seen in the 1980s and early 1990s. She was 1st in tournaments in New Delhi (1984) and Banja Luka (1985), finished third in Bilbao (1987) with a 2616 performance rating against elite players while equalising in an 8 game match against GM Petar Popović who had a rating of 2545 and in the next decade she finished 1st in Belgrade (1992), Vienna (1993), and Lippstadt (1995, 1996, 1997).

Chiburdanidze was the first woman to win an elite round-robin tournament, winning two in the mid-1980s.

She was a key member of the USSR team that dominated the women&#x27;s Olympiads of the 1980s and, when Georgia achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, she played board 1 for the new Georgian national team that won four gold medals, in 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2008.

She also played in the European Team Championships of 1997 when Georgia won the gold medal and in the 1st Europe v Asia Intercontinental rapidplay match which was held in Batumi (Georgia) in September 2001. Asia won the women&#x27;s section by 21½–10½ with Maia contributing 3½.
In 2008 Dresden Olympiad, she played on board 1, for Georgia, that won the gold medal (1st place), and she also won gold medal for best performance (2715 pt). She played her last tournament (up-to-date) in July, 2012.

==Other==
Chiburdanidze has been honoured many times by her country, and several postage stamps have been designed to celebrate her chess achievements. Mongolia issued a commemorative stamp in 1986 which illustrates a position in one of her games from the 1984 world championship match against Irina Levitina. She was inducted into the World Chess Hall of Fame in 2014.

In 2021, Chiburdanidze appeared in the documentary &quot;Glory to the Queen&quot; alongside Nana Alexandria, Nona Gaprindashvili, and Nana Ioseliani.

<doc id="577704" wikidata="Q824489" url="?curid=577704" title="Estado Novo (Portugal)">
<text>The Estado Novo (, ) was the corporatist Portuguese state installed in 1933. It evolved from the &quot;Ditadura Nacional&quot; (&quot;National Dictatorship&quot;) formed after the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 28 May 1926 against the unstable First Republic. Together, the &quot;Ditadura Nacional&quot; and the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; are recognised by historians as the Second Portuguese Republic (). The &quot;Estado Novo&quot;, greatly inspired by conservative and autocratic ideologies, was developed by António de Oliveira Salazar, who was President of the Council of Ministers from 1932 until illness forced him out of office in 1968.

Opposed to communism, socialism, syndicalism, anarchism, liberalism and anti-colonialism, and fascism, the regime was conservative, corporatist, and nationalist in nature, defending Portugal&#x27;s traditional Catholicism. Its policy envisaged the perpetuation of Portugal as a pluricontinental nation under the doctrine of lusotropicalism, with Angola, Mozambique, and other Portuguese territories as extensions of Portugal itself, it being a supposed source of civilization and stability to the overseas societies in the African and Asian possessions. Under the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;, Portugal tried to perpetuate a vast, centuries-old empire with a total area of , while other former colonial powers had, by this time, largely acceded to global calls for self-determination and independence of their overseas colonies.

Although Portugal was a dictatorial country, it pursued economic policies aligned with those of democratic and developed nations. The first steps toward economic integration began in 1948 when Portugal joined the Marshall Plan, and subsequently became a founding member of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC). In 1960, Portugal joined the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which allowed the country to integrate its industries with European markets while protecting its agriculture and fisheries, where it could not compete with Northern European nations. Portugal also expanded its economic ties globally by joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1962. Under Marcelo Caetano, who replaced an aging Salazar as prime minister in 1968, the country continued to liberalize its economy and advance European integration. This effort culminated in the signing of a free trade agreement with the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1972. When Portugal, under the Third Portuguese Republic, finally joined the EEC in 1986, most trade barriers with the rest of Western Europe had already been dismantled by the Estado Novo, with the exception of those relating to agricultural goods and fisheries and, more importantly, trade with Spain.

On the political front, Portugal was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, and joined the United Nations (UN) in 1955. From 1950 until Salazar&#x27;s death in 1970, Portugal saw its GDP per capita increase at an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent, leading to significant economic convergence with wealthier Western European nations. Despite this remarkable economic growth, by the fall of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; in 1974, Portugal still had the lowest per capita income and the lowest literacy rate in Western Europe. However, this economic convergence slowed or even reversed after the end of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;, as political and economic instability in the post-1974 period hampered further progress. On 25 April 1974, the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, a military coup organized by left-wing Portuguese military officers – the Armed Forces Movement (MFA) – led to the end of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;.

==Prelude==

King Carlos I of Portugal confirmed colonial treaties of the 19th century that stabilized the situation in Portuguese Africa. These agreements were, however, unpopular in Portugal, where they were seen as being to the disadvantage of the country. In addition, Portugal was declared bankrupt twice – first on 14 June 1892 and again on 10 May 1902 – causing industrial disturbances, socialist and republican antagonism, and press criticism of the monarchy. Carlos responded by appointing João Franco as prime minister and subsequently accepting parliament&#x27;s dissolution. In 1908, Carlos I was assassinated in Lisbon by anti-monarchists. The Portuguese monarchy lasted until 1910 when, through the 5 October revolution, it was overthrown and Portugal was proclaimed a republic. The overthrow of the Portuguese monarchy in 1910 led to a 16-year struggle to sustain parliamentary democracy under republicanism – the Portuguese First Republic (1910–1926).

The 28 May 1926 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; or, during the period of &quot;Estado Novo&quot;, the National Revolution (), was a military action that put an end to the chaotic Portuguese First Republic and initiated the &quot;Ditadura Militar&quot; (Military Dictatorship) which in 1928 transitioned into the &quot;Ditadura Nacional&quot; (National Dictatorship). Salazar became prime minister in 1932, and in 1933 renamed it the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; (New State), defining Portugal as a corporative, single-party and multi-continental country.

With fascist organizations being popular and widely supported across many countries (like Italian Fascism and National Socialism) as an antagonist of communist ideologies, António de Oliveira Salazar developed the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; as an alternative; &quot;Estado Novo&quot; a conservative authoritarian regime that was neither fascist nor totalitarian. Salazar&#x27;s regime can be described as a syncretic corporatist government; Portuguese historian Ernesto C. Leal described the ideology of Salazar and his state as a combination of anti-liberalism, conservatism and authoritarian nationalism that featured social corporatism and Catholic corporatism. The basis of Salazar&#x27;s regime was a platform of stability, in direct contrast to the unstable environment of the First Republic.

According to some Portuguese scholars like Jaime Nogueira Pinto and Rui Ramos, his early reforms and policies changed the whole nation by permitting political and financial stability and therefore a calm social order and economic growth, after the politically unstable and financially chaotic years of the Portuguese First Republic (1910–1926). Following the First Republic, when not even public order had been achieved, this looked like an impressive breakthrough to most of the population; at this point, Salazar achieved the height of his popularity. This transformation of Portugal was then known as &quot;A Lição de Salazar&quot; – &quot;Salazar&#x27;s Lesson&quot;. Salazar&#x27;s program was opposed to communism, socialism, and liberalism. It was pro-Catholic, conservative, and nationalistic. Its policy envisaged the perpetuation of Portugal as a pluricontinental empire, financially autonomous and politically independent from the dominating superpowers, and a source of civilization and stability to the overseas societies in the African and Asian possessions.

To support his colonial policies, Salazar eventually adopted Brazilian historian Gilberto Freyre&#x27;s notion of lusotropicalism by asserting that, since Portugal had been a multicultural, multiracial, and pluricontinental nation since the 15th century, losing its overseas territories in Africa and Asia would dismember the country and end Portuguese independence. In geopolitical terms, losing these territories would decrease the Portuguese state&#x27;s self-sufficiency.

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Salazar had strongly resisted Freyre&#x27;s ideas, partly because Freyre claimed the Portuguese were more prone than other European nations to miscegenation. Salazar adopted lusotropicalism only after sponsoring Freyre on a visit to Portugal and some of its overseas territories in 1951 and 1952. Freyre&#x27;s work, &quot;Aventura e Rotina&quot; (&quot;Adventure and Routine&quot;) resulted from this visit.

Under the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime, Portugal&#x27;s most notable sports star, Eusébio da Silva Ferreira, and the most decorated military officer of the Portuguese Armed Forces, Marcelino da Mata, were both black Portuguese citizens born and raised in Portugal&#x27;s African territories.

==Regime==

The &quot;Estado Novo&quot; based its political philosophy around a close interpretation of the Catholic social doctrine, much like the contemporary regime of Engelbert Dollfuss in Austria. The economic system, known as corporatism, was based on similar interpretations of the papal encyclicals &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; (Leo XIII, 1891) and &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; (Pius XI, 1931), which were meant to prevent class struggle and transform economic concerns secondary to social values. &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; argued that labour associations were part of the natural order, like the family. The right of men to organize into trade unions and to engage in labour activities was thus inherent and could not be denied by employers or the state. &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; provided the blueprint for the erection of the corporatist system.

A new constitution was drafted by a group of lawyers, businessmen, clerics, and university professors, with Salazar as the leading spirit and Marcelo Caetano also playing a major role. The constitution created the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; (&#x27;New State&#x27;), in theory a corporatist state representing interest groups rather than individuals. The leaders wanted a system in which the people would be represented through corporations, rather than through divisive parties, and where national interest was given priority over sectional claims. Salazar thought that the party system had failed irretrievably in Portugal.

Unlike Mussolini or Hitler, Salazar never had the intention to create a party-state. Salazar was against the whole-party concept, he rejected the concept of a mass-mobilizing party that sought to control all aspects of life, as seen in fascist regimes and in 1930 he created the National Union, a single-party, but he created it as a non-ideological, non-party, a passive institution, serving more as a facade of political order rather than a power-holding organization in its own right. The National Union was set up to control and restrain public opinion rather than to mobilize it; the goal was to strengthen and preserve traditional values rather than to induce a new social order. Ministers, diplomats, and civil servants were never compelled to join the National Union.

The legislature, called the National Assembly, was restricted to members of the National Union. It could initiate legislation, but only concerning matters that did not require government expenditures. The parallel Corporative Chamber included representatives of municipalities, religious, cultural, and professional groups, and of the official workers&#x27; syndicates that replaced free trade unions.

According to Howard Wiarda, &quot;The men who came to power in the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; were genuinely concerned with the poverty and backwardness of their nation, divorcing themselves from Anglo-American political influences while developing a new indigenous political model and alleviating the miserable living conditions of both rural and urban poor.&quot;

The new constitution introduced by Salazar established an anti-parliamentarian and authoritarian government that would last until 1974. The president was to be elected by popular vote for a period of seven years. On paper, the new document vested sweeping, almost dictatorial powers in the hands of the president, including the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister. The president was elevated to a position of preeminence as the &quot;balance wheel&quot;, the defender and ultimate arbiter of national politics. President Carmona, however, had allowed Salazar more or less a free hand since appointing him prime minister and continued to do so. Carmona and his successors would largely be figureheads as Salazar wielded the true power. Wiarda argues that Salazar achieved his position of power not just because of constitutional stipulations, but also because of his character: domineering, absolutist, ambitious, hardworking, and intellectually brilliant.

The corporatist constitution was approved in the national Portuguese constitutional referendum of 19 March 1933. A draft had been published one year before, and the public was invited to state any objections in the press. These tended to stay in the realm of generalities and only a handful of people, less than 6,000, voted against the new constitution. The new constitution was approved with 99.5% of the vote, but with 488,840 abstentions (in a registered electorate of 1,330,258) counting as &quot;yes&quot;. Hugh Kay points out that the large number of abstentions might be attributable to the fact that voters were presented with a package deal to which they had to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; with no opportunity to accept one clause and reject another. In this referendum, women were allowed to vote for the first time in Portugal. Their right to vote had not been obtained during the First Republic, despite feminist efforts, and even in the referendum vote, secondary education was a requirement for female voters, whereas males only needed to be able to read and write. The right for women to vote was later broadened twice under the Estado Novo. The first time was in 1946 and the second time in 1968 under Marcelo Caetano, law 2137 proclaimed the equality of men and women for electoral purposes. The 1968 electoral law did not make any distinction between men and women.

The year 1933 marked a watershed of legislation in Portuguese history. Under Salazar&#x27;s supervision, Teotónio Pereira, the Sub-Secretary of State of Corporations and Social Welfare, reporting directly to Salazar, enacted extensive legislation that shaped the corporatist structure and initiated a comprehensive social welfare system. This system was equally anti-capitalist and anti-socialist. The corporatization of the working class was accompanied by strict legislation regulating business. Workers&#x27; organizations were subordinated to state control but granted a legitimacy that they had never before enjoyed and were made beneficiaries of a variety of new social programs. Nevertheless, it is important to note that even in the enthusiastic early years, corporatist agencies were not at the center of power and therefore corporatism was not the true base of the whole system.

In 1934, Portugal crushed the Portuguese Fascist Movement and exiled Francisco Rolão Preto as a part of a purge of the leadership of the Portuguese National Syndicalists, also known as the &quot;camisas azuis&quot; (&quot;Blue Shirts&quot;). Salazar denounced the National Syndicalists as &quot;inspired by certain foreign models&quot; and condemned their &quot;exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organizing masses behind a single leader&quot; as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;. Salazar&#x27;s own party, the National Union, was formed as a subservient umbrella organization to support the regime itself, and therefore did not have its own philosophy. At the time, many European countries feared the destructive potential of communism. Many members of the National Syndicalist Movement eventually joined the National Union. One overriding criticism of his regime is that stability was bought and maintained at the expense of suppression of human rights and liberties.

The corporatist state had some similarities to Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italian fascism, but considerable differences in its moral approach to governing. Although Salazar admired Mussolini and was influenced by his Labour Charter of 1927, Salazar distanced himself from fascist dictatorship, which he considered a pagan Caesarist political system that recognized neither legal nor moral limits. Salazar also viewed German Nazism as espousing pagan elements that he considered repugnant. Just before World War II, Salazar made this declaration: &quot;We are opposed to all forms of Internationalism, Communism, Socialism, Syndicalism and everything that may divide or minimize, or break up the family. We are against class warfare, irreligion and disloyalty to one&#x27;s country; against serfdom, a materialistic conception of life, and might over right.&quot; however the Estado Novo adopted many fascist characteristics with the Legião Portuguesa, Mocidade Portuguesa, and Corporatism being the most prominent examples; after the end of World War II, Salazar distanced his regime from fascism.

===World War II===

Portugal was officially neutral in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), but quietly furnished help to the nationalists of Francisco Franco. During World War II, 1939–1945, Portugal remained officially neutral, giving its highest priority to avoiding a Nazi invasion of the sort that was so devastating in most other European countries. The regime at first showed some pro-Axis sympathies; Salazar for example expressed approval for the German invasion of the Soviet Union. From 1943 onward, Portugal favoured the Allies, leasing air bases in the Azores. Portugal reluctantly leased the Azores as a direct result of being threatened with invasion should Portugal not cater to the requests of the Allies. As an official neutral, Portugal traded with both sides. It cut off vital shipments of tungsten and rubber to Germany in 1944, after heavy pressure from the Allies. Lisbon was the base for International Red Cross operations aiding Allied POWs and was the main air transit point between Britain and the U.S.

In 1942, Australian troops briefly occupied Portuguese Timor, but were soon overwhelmed by invading Japanese. Salazar worked to regain control of East Timor, which came about after the Japanese surrender in 1945.

In 1945, Portugal declared two days of mourning for the death of Adolf Hitler.

===Post-World War II===

After World War II (1939–1945), however, the corporatist economic model was less and less applicable. And after decolonization in the 1950s and 1960s, the Portuguese regime became also a source of criticism and dissent by most of the international community. Nevertheless, Salazar clung to it, thereby slowing the nation&#x27;s long-term economic development. Salazar&#x27;s postwar policy allowed some liberalization in politics, in terms of organized opposition with more freedom of the press. Opposition parties were tolerated to an extent, but they were also controlled, limited, and manipulated, with the result that they split into factions and never formed a united opposition. He permitted the formation of Movement of Democratic Unity (&quot;Movimento de Unidade Democrática&quot;) in 1945. It boycotted the election and Salazar won handily on 18 November 1945. In 1949 Portugal became a founding member of NATO.
President Óscar Carmona died in 1951 after 25 years in office and was succeeded by Francisco Craveiro Lopes. However, Lopes was not willing to give Salazar the free hand that Carmona had given him, and was forced to resign just before the end of his term in 1958.
Naval Minister Américo Tomás, a staunch conservative, ran in the 1958 elections as the official candidate. General Humberto Delgado was the opposition candidate—the only time in both incarnations of the Second Republic that an opposition candidate was still in the race on election day. Delgado was credited with only around 25% of the votes with 52.6% in favour of Tomás. The election had initially been seen as little better than a pantomime of democracy before a reporter asked Delgado whether he would retain Salazar if elected. Delgado famously replied, &quot;Obviamente, demito-o!&quot; (&quot;Obviously, I&#x27;ll sack him!&quot;) He was well aware that the president&#x27;s ability to dismiss the prime minister was, on paper, the only check on Salazar&#x27;s power. Delgado&#x27;s rallies subsequently attracted vast crowds. Evidence later surfaced that the PIDE had stuffed the ballot boxes with votes for Tomás, leading many neutral observers to conclude that Delgado would have won had Salazar allowed an honest election.

After the elections, Delgado was expelled from the Portuguese military and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy before going into exile, spending much of it in Brazil and later in Algeria. Even though the electoral system was so heavily rigged in favour of the National Union that Tomás could not have possibly been defeated, Salazar was not willing to leave anything to chance. He abolished the direct election of presidents in favour of indirect election by the National Assembly—which was firmly controlled by the regime—serving as an electoral college.

On 23 January 1961, military officer and politician Henrique Galvão led the hijacking of the Portuguese passenger ship &quot;Santa Maria&quot;. The terrorist operation was successful as anti-regime propaganda but killed one man in the process. Galvão claimed that his intentions were to sail to the Overseas Province of Angola to set up a renegade Portuguese government in opposition to Salazar in Luanda. Galvão released the passengers in negotiation with Brazilian officials in exchange for political asylum in Brazil. Later that year hijackers forced an aircraft to circle Lisbon to drop leaflets against the dictatorship. After that, the six hijackers forced the crew to fly them back to Morocco.

In 1962, the Academic Crisis occurred. The regime, fearing the growing popularity of both purely democratic and communist ideas among the students, carried out the boycott and closure of several student associations and organizations, including the important National Secretariat of Portuguese Students. Most members of this organization were opposition militants, among them many communists. Anti-regime political activists were investigated and persecuted by PIDE-DGS (the secret police), and according to the gravity of the offence, were usually sent to jail or transferred from one university to another in order to destabilize oppositionist networks and their hierarchical organization. The students, with strong support from the clandestine Portuguese Communist Party, responded with demonstrations which culminated on 24 March with a huge student demonstration in Lisbon, which was vigorously suppressed by the riot police. Marcelo Caetano, a distinguished member of the regime and the incumbent rector of the University of Lisbon, resigned.

The reluctance of many young men to embrace the hardships of the Portuguese Colonial War resulted in tens of thousands of Portuguese citizens each year leaving to seek economic opportunities abroad in order to escape conscription. In over 15 years, nearly one million emigrated to France, another million to the United States, many hundreds of thousands to Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Venezuela, or Brazil. Political parties, such as the Socialist Party, persecuted at home, were established in exile. The only party which managed to continue (illegally) operating in Portugal during all the dictatorship was the Portuguese Communist Party.

In 1964, Delgado founded the Portuguese National Liberation Front in Rome, stating in public that the only way to end the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; would be by a military coup, while many others advocated a &quot;national uprising&quot; approach.

Delgado and his Brazilian secretary, Arajaryr Moreira de Campos, were murdered on 13 February 1965 in Spain in an ambush by PIDE.

According to some Portuguese right-wing scholars like Jaime Nogueira Pinto and Rui Ramos, Salazar&#x27;s early reforms and policies allowed political and financial stability and therefore social order and economic growth, after the politically unstable and financially chaotic years of the Portuguese First Republic (1910–1926). Other historians, like left-wing politician Fernando Rosas, point out that Salazar&#x27;s policies from the 1930s to the 1950s, led to economic and social stagnation and rampant emigration, turning Portugal into one of the poorest countries in Europe, that was also thwarted by scoring lower on literacy than its peers of the Northern Hemisphere.

Salazar suffered a stroke in 1968. As it was thought that he did not have long to live, Tomás replaced him with Marcelo Caetano, former rector of the University of Lisbon and prominent scholar of its law school, and despite his protest resignation in 1962, a supporter of the regime. Salazar was never informed of this decision, and reportedly died in 1970 still believing he was prime minister. Most of the people hoped Caetano would soften the edges of Salazar&#x27;s authoritarian regime and modernize the already growing economy. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and made important social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. Some large-scale investments were made at the national level, such as the building of a major oil processing center in Sines. The economy reacted very well at first, but into the 1970s some serious problems began to show, due in part to two-digit inflation (from 1970 and on) and to the effects of the 1973 oil crisis.

However, the 1973 oil crisis had a potentially beneficial effect on Portugal because the largely unexploited oil reserves that Portugal had in its overseas territories of Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe were being developed at a fast pace. Although Caetano was fundamentally authoritarian, he did make some efforts to open up the regime. Soon after taking power, he rebranded the regime as the &quot;Social State&quot;, and slightly increased freedom of speech and the press. These measures did not go nearly far enough for a significant element of the population who had no memory of the instability which preceded Salazar. The people were also disappointed that Caetano was unwilling to open up the electoral system. The conduct of the 1969 and 1973 elections was little different from past elections over the previous four decades. The National Union—renamed People&#x27;s National Action—swept every seat, as before. Also as before, the opposition was still barely tolerated; opposition candidates were subjected to harsh repression. However, Caetano had to expend all of his political capital to wring even these meager reforms out of the hardliners in the regime—most notably Tomás, who was not nearly as willing to give Caetano the free rein that he gave Salazar. Caetano was thus in no position to resist when Tomás and the other hardliners forced the end of the reform experiment in 1973.

==Economy==

Portugal&#x27;s overriding problem in 1926 was its enormous public debt. Several times between 1926 and 1928, Salazar turned down appointments to the finance ministry. He pleaded ill-health, devotion to his aged parents and a preference for the academic cloisters. In 1927, under the ministry of Sinel de Cordes, the public deficit kept on growing. The government tried to obtain loans from Baring Brothers under the auspices of the League of Nations, but the conditions were considered unacceptable. With Portugal under the threat of an imminent financial collapse, Salazar finally agreed to become its 81st finance minister on 26 April 1928 after the republican and Freemason Óscar Carmona was elected president. However, before accepting the position, he personally secured from Carmona a categorical assurance that as finance minister he would have a free hand to veto expenditure in all government departments, not just his own. Salazar was the financial czar virtually from the day he took office.

Within one year, armed with special powers, Salazar balanced the budget and stabilized Portugal&#x27;s currency. Restoring order to the national accounts, enforcing austerity, and red-penciling waste, Salazar produced the first of many budgetary surpluses, an unparalleled novelty in Portugal.

In July 1940, the American &quot;Life&quot; magazine featured an article on Portugal, and, referring to its recent chaotic history, asserted that &quot;anyone who saw Portugal 15 years ago might well have said it deserved to die. It was atrociously governed, bankrupt, squalid, ridden with disease and poverty. It was such a mess that the League of Nations coined a word to describe the absolute low in national welfare: &#x27;Portuguese&#x27;. Then the Army overthrew the Republic which had brought the country to this sorry pass&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; added that ruling Portugal was difficult and explained how Salazar &quot;found a country in chaos and poverty&quot; and then reformed it&quot;.

Under Salazar, Estado Novo featured a mixed economy that was neither capitalist nor communist, and was instead organized along quasi-traditional framework of corporatism. There was extensive state regulation as well as dominance of private ownership of the means of production. Major industrialists of Portugal accepted extensive control in return for a guarantee of minimal public ownership, along with restrictions on economic competition. Salazar&#x27;s economy organized employers and workers into guilds and syndicates, divided into industries such as transport, commerce and banking; guilds were also organized for farmers and rural workers, fishermen, and skilled professions. Within this framework, the state exercised extensive authority regarding private investment decisions and the level of wages. A relocation or constructions of an industrial plan, as well as investments into machinery or equipment to increase the capacity of already existing enterprises, required government approval. According to Howard J. Wiarda, &quot;in reality both labor and capital and indeed the entire corporate institutional network were subordinate to the central state apparatus&quot;. In regards to trade, the Estado Novo was extensively protectionist.

From 1950 until Salazar&#x27;s death in 1970, Portugal saw its GDP per capita increase at an annual average rate of 5.7 per cent. The rise of new technocrats in the early 1960s with a background in economics and technical-industrial expertise led to a new period of economic fostering, with Portugal as an attractive country for international investment. Industrial development and economic growth continued throughout the 1960s. During Salazar&#x27;s tenure, Portugal participated in the founding of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1961. In the early 1960s, Portugal also added its membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. This marked the initiation of Salazar&#x27;s more outward-looking economic policy. Portuguese foreign trade increased by 52 per cent in exports and 40 per cent in imports. The economic growth and levels of capital formation from 1960 to 1973 were characterized by unparalleled robust annual growth rates of GDP (6.9 per cent), industrial production (9 per cent), private consumption (6.5 per cent), and gross fixed capital formation (7.8 per cent).

In 1960, at the initiation of Salazar&#x27;s more outward-looking economic policy after the beginning of the end of a period of deep economically illiberal corporativism and protectionism, Portugal&#x27;s per capita GDP was only 38 per cent of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 per cent; and in 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal&#x27;s per capita GDP had reached 56.4 per cent of the EC-12 average. On a long term analysis, after a long period of economic divergence before 1914, and a period of chaos during the First Republic, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence with the wealthiest economies of Western Europe, until the Carnation Revolution in April 1974. Portuguese economic growth in the period 1960 to 1973 under the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime (and even with the effects of an expensive war effort in African territories against independentist guerrilla groups supported by the Communist Bloc and others), created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe. Through emigration, trade, tourism and foreign investment, individuals and firms changed their patterns of production and consumption, bringing about a structural transformation. Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of a growing economy raised new technical and organizational challenges, stimulating the formation of modern professional and management teams.
Regarding the overseas territories, beyond military measures, the official Portuguese response to the &quot;winds of change&quot; in the African colonies was to integrate them administratively and economically more closely with the mainland. This was accomplished through the population and capital transfers, trade liberalization, and the creation of a common currency, the so-called &quot;Escudo Area&quot;. The integration program established in 1961 provided for the removal of Portugal&#x27;s duties on imports from its overseas territories by January 1964. The latter, on the other hand, were permitted to continue to levy duties on goods imported from Portugal but at a preferential rate, in most cases, 50 per cent of the normal duties levied by the territories on goods originating outside the Escudo Area. The effect of this two-tier tariff system was to give Portugal&#x27;s exports preferential access to its colonial markets. The economies of the overseas provinces, especially those of both the Overseas Province of Angola and Mozambique, boomed. 

The very late and excruciatingly slow liberalization of the Portuguese economy gained a new impetus under Salazar&#x27;s successor, Prime Minister Marcello José das Neves Caetano (1968–1974), whose administration abolished industrial licensing requirements for firms in most sectors and in 1972 signed a free trade agreement with the newly enlarged European Community. Under the agreement, which took effect at the beginning of 1973, Portugal was given until 1980 to abolish its restrictions on most community goods and until 1985 on certain sensitive products amounting to some 10 per cent of the EC&#x27;s total exports to Portugal. Starting in 1960, EFTA membership and a growing foreign investor presence contributed to Portugal&#x27;s industrial modernization and export diversification between 1960 and 1973. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. Some large-scale investments were made at the national level, such as the building of a major oil processing center in Sines.

Notwithstanding the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a small number of family-based financial-industrial groups, Portuguese business culture permitted a surprising upward mobility of university-educated individuals with middle-class backgrounds into professional management careers.

Before the 1974 Carnation Revolution, the largest, most technologically advanced (and most recently organized) firms offered the greatest opportunity for management careers based on merit rather than by accident of birth.

By the early 1970s Portugal&#x27;s fast economic growth with increasing consumption and purchase of new automobiles set the priority for improvements in transportation. Brisa – Autoestradas de Portugal was founded in 1972 and the state granted the company a 30-year concession to design, build, manage, and maintain a modern network of express motorways.

The economy of Portugal and its overseas territories on the eve of the Carnation Revolution (a military coup on 25 April 1974) was growing well above the European average. Average family purchasing power was rising together with new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investments in new capital equipment and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable consumer goods.

The &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime&#x27;s economic policy encouraged and created conditions for the formation of large and successful business conglomerates. Economically, the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime maintained a policy of corporatism that resulted in the placement of a big part of the Portuguese economy in the hands of a number of strong conglomerates, including those founded by the families of António Champalimaud (Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, Cimpor), José Manuel de Mello (CUF – Companhia União Fabril, Banco Totta &amp; Açores), Américo Amorim (Corticeira Amorim) and the dos Santos family (Jerónimo Martins). Those Portuguese conglomerates had business models with similarities to Japanese &quot;keiretsus&quot; and &quot;zaibatsus&quot; or the South Korean &quot;chaebols&quot; in terms of vision, mission and purpose. The Companhia União Fabril (CUF) was one of the largest and most diversified Portuguese conglomerates with its core businesses (cement, chemicals, petrochemicals, agrochemicals, textiles, beer, beverages, metallurgy, naval engineering, electrical engineering, insurance, banking, paper, tourism, mining, etc.) and corporate headquarters located in mainland Portugal, but also with branches, plants and several developing business projects all around the Portuguese Empire, especially in the Portuguese territories of Angola and Mozambique. Other medium-sized family companies specialized in textiles (for instance those located in the city of Covilhã and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain, glass and crystal (like those of Alcobaça, Caldas da Rainha and Marinha Grande), engineered wood (like SONAE near Porto), motorcycle manufacturing (like Casal and FAMEL in the District of Aveiro), canned fish (like those of Algarve and the northwest which included one of the oldest canned fish companies in continuous operation in the world), fishing, food and beverages (alcoholic beverages, from liqueurs like Licor Beirão and Ginjinha, to beer like Sagres, were produced across the entire country, but port wine was one of its most reputed and exported alcoholic beverages), tourism (well established in Estoril, Cascais and Sintra (the Portuguese Riviera) and growing as an international attraction in the Algarve since the 1960s) and in agriculture and agribusiness (like the ones scattered around Ribatejo and Alentejo – known as the &quot;breadbasket of Portugal&quot;, as well as the notorious Cachão Agroindustrial Complex established in Mirandela, Northern Portugal, in 1963) completed the panorama of the national economy by the early 1970s and included export-orienteed foreign direct investment-funded businesses such as an automotive assembly plant founded in 1962 by Citroën which began operations in 1964 in Mangualde and a Leica factory established in 1973 in Vila Nova de Famalicão. In addition, the rural population was committed to agrarianism—greatly important for a majority of the total population, with many families living exclusively from agriculture or complementing their salaries with farming, husbandry and forestry yields.

Besides that, the overseas territories were also displaying impressive economic growth and development rates from the 1920s onwards. Even during the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974), a counterinsurgency war against independentist guerrillas and terrorism, the overseas territories of Angola and Mozambique (Portuguese overseas territories at the time) had continuous economic growth rates and several sectors of their local economies were booming. They were internationally notable centres of production of oil, coffee, cotton, cashew, coconut, timber, minerals (like diamonds), metals (like iron and aluminium), banana, citrus, tea, sisal, beer (Cuca (Angola) and Laurentina (Mozambique) were successful beer brands produced locally), cement, fish and other sea products, beef and textiles. Tourism was also a fast developing activity in Portuguese Africa both by the growing development of and demand for beach resorts and wildlife reserves. While the counterinsurgency war was won in Angola, it was less than satisfactorily contained in Mozambique and dangerously stalemated in Portuguese Guinea from the Portuguese point of view, so the Portuguese government decided to create sustainability policies in order to allow continuous sources of financing for the war effort in the long run. On 13 November 1972, a sovereign wealth fund (&quot;Fundo do Ultramar&quot; - the Overseas Fund) was enacted through the Decree Law &quot;Decreto-Lei No. 448/ /72&quot; and the Ministry of Defense ordinance &quot;Portaria 696/72&quot;, in order to finance the counterinsurgency effort in the Portuguese overseas territories. In addition, new decree laws (Decree Law: &quot;Decretos-Leis Nos. 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto&quot;) were enforced in order to cut down military expenses and increase the number of officers by incorporating irregular militia as if they were regular military academy officers.

Labour unions were not allowed and a minimum wage policy was not enforced. However, in a context of an expanding economy, bringing better living conditions for the Portuguese population in the 1960s, the outbreak of the colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of more and more women into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. The objectives of Caetano&#x27;s pension reform were threefold: enhancing equity, reducing fiscal and actuarial imbalance, and achieving more efficiency for the economy as a whole, for example, by establishing contributions less distortive to labour markets or by allowing the savings generated by pension funds to increase the investments in the economy. In 1969, with the replacement of Salazar by Marcelo Caetano, the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;-controlled nation got indeed a very slight taste of democracy and Caetano allowed the formation of the first democratic labour union movement since the 1920s.

== Education ==

=== First years (1933–1936) ===

With its founding 1933 political constitution, the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; established compulsory education at three years. Compulsory education was first introduced in Portugal during the monarchy (in 1844) with the duration of three years, then increased to five years during the First Republic, but it was never really enforced. The political constitution defines public education as aiming for: &quot;in addition to the physical reinvigoration and the improvement of intellectual faculties, the formation of character, professional value and all civic and moral virtues&quot; (Constituição de 1933, Artigo 43).

During the first three years of the Estado Novo, the then Ministry of Public Instruction, had a total of four different ministers.
=== Ministry of Carneiro Pacheco (1936–1940) ===
In 1936, António Carneiro Pacheco (then rector of the University of Lisbon) was nominated as the minister of the public instruction. In the same year, his ministry issued a law that altered the ministry&#x27;s name to Ministry of National Education, and included a National Board of Education (&quot;Junta Nacional da Educação&quot;). This National Board of Education aimed to study and inform the minister in all matters of both education and culture. Parents and educators were to be represented in all sections of this board, except for the cultural relations and scientific research section. This board replaced the Superior Council for Public Instruction, which had existed since 1835, along with other consulting boards, such as the National Board of Excavations and Antiques.

Further events of note during Pacheco&#x27;s mandate were the creation of the Mocidade Portuguesa, the Plan of the Centennials (&quot;Plano dos Centenários&quot;), and the adoption of a single, national textbook for each grade.

The Mocidade Portuguesa was established in 1936, defined as a &quot;national and pre-military organization that is able to stimulate the integral development of [the youth&#x27;s] physical capacities, the formation of [their] character and devotion to the Fatherland and put [them] in conditions to be able to compete effectively for its defense&quot; (Law 1941, Base XI).

The Plan of the Centennials aimed to build a network of schools, uniformed by region, that would obey the pedagogical and hygienic criteria of the time. The buildings would be adapted to reflect the differences in climate, material resources, and processes of construction of each region. The plan was officially approved in 1939, but due to World War II, only started its first phase in 1944. It extended well beyond Pacheco&#x27;s mandate, with its VI phase in 1959. It was replaced in 1961 by the &quot;New Plan of Constructions&quot;. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of primary schools grew from 27,000 to 40,000.

=== Between Carneiro Pacheco and Veiga Simão (1940–1970) ===

In 1952, while 81.4% of the children aged 10 to 11 were literate, only 6.3% of them had finished the three years of compulsory education. In this same year, a vast multi-pronged Plan for Popular Education was launched with the intent of reducing adolescent and adult illiteracy and put into school every child of school age. This plan included fines for parents who did not comply, and these were strictly enforced.

In 1956, compulsory education for boys (and girls in 1960) was raised from three to four years.

By the late 1950s, Portugal had succeeded in pulling itself out of the educational abyss in which it had long found itself: illiteracy among children of school age virtually disappeared.

In 1959, the education minister, Leite Pinto, promoted the first conversations between Portugal and OECD, that led to Portugal being included in an OECD project (DEEB, Development and Economy in Educational Building) to help mediterranean countries in 1963.

In 1962, the Overseas Ministry, then headed by Adriano Moreira, founded universities in the overseas provinces of Angola (University of Luanda) and Mozambique (University of Lourenço Marques). In addition, the long established Lisbon and Coimbra universities had been highly expanded and modernized by this decade. New buildings and campuses were constructed. Great works of expansion and modernization of the University of Lisbon in the 1950s and 1960s and of the University of Coimbra from 1943 onwards, developed entire new areas in those two cities known as &quot;Cidade Universitária&quot; (Lisbon) and &quot;Alta Universitária&quot; (Coimbra).

In 1964, compulsory education was raised from four to six years.

In 1965, an instructional television program was created (&quot;Telescola&quot;), filmed in Rádio e Televisão de Portugal&#x27;s studios in Porto to support isolated rural areas and overcrowded suburban schools.

=== Veiga Simão Reforms (1970–1974) ===

In 1970, during the Marcelist Spring, José Veiga Simão (1929 - 2014) (then rector of Universidade de Lourenço Marques) became the last minister of education of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;. In 1971, Veiga Simão went on TV to present two projects, one aimed at reforming the school system, the other aimed at reforming higher education. In that same year, his ministry would recognize the Portuguese Catholic University. In July 1973, after ample social discussion of his projects, Veiga Simão launched a &quot;Basic Law of Education&quot;, which aimed to democratize education in Portugal and, in August of that year, also launched a decree that would create the Nova de Lisboa, Aveiro and Minho universities, the Instituto Universitário de Évora, several politechnical schools (e.g., Covilhã, Faro, Leiria, Setúbal, Tomar, Vila Real) and superior schools (e.g., Beja, Bragança, Castelo Branco, Funchal, Ponta Delgada). Less than a year later, the Carnation Revolution took place, ending the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;.

==End of the regime==


After India achieved independence in 1947 under the Attlee government, pro-Indian residents of the Portuguese overseas territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organizations, liberated Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954. In 1961, the Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá&#x27;s annexation by the Republic of Dahomey was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire. According to the census of 1921 São João Baptista de Ajudá had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese sovereignty. Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of Goa and Daman and Diu. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of Portuguese India against the Indian Armed Forces. The operations resulted in the defeat of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal&#x27;s National Assembly. The so-called &quot;Winds of Change&quot; concerning historical colonization in Europe-ruled overseas territories, started to have influence over the centuries-old empire. The end of the Estado Novo effectively began with the uprisings in the overseas territories in Africa during the 1960s. The independence movements active in Portuguese Angola, Portuguese Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea were supported by both the United States and the Soviet Union, which both wanted to end all colonial empires and expand their own spheres of influence.

For the Portuguese ruling regime, the centuries-old overseas empire was a matter of national interest. The criticism against some kinds of racial discrimination in the Portuguese African territories were refuted on the grounds that all Portuguese Africans would be Westernized and assimilated in due time, through a process called the civilizing mission. The wars had the same effects in Portugal as the Vietnam War in the United States, or the Afghanistan War in the Soviet Union; they were unpopular and expensive lengthy wars which were isolating Portugal diplomatically, leading many to question the continuation of the war and, by extension, the government. Although Portugal was able to maintain some superiority in the colonies by its use of elite paratroopers and special operations troops, the foreign support to the guerrillas, including arms embargoes and other sanctions against the Portuguese, made them more manoeuvrable, allowing them to inflict losses on the Portuguese army. The international community isolated Portugal due to the long-lasting Colonial War. The situation was aggravated by the illness of Salazar, the strong man of the regime, in 1968. His replacement was one of his closest advisors, Marcelo Caetano, who tried to slowly democratize the country, but could not hide the obvious dictatorship that oppressed Portugal. Salazar died in 1970.

After spending the early years of his priesthood in Africa, the British priest Adrian Hastings created a storm in 1973 with an article in &quot;The Times&quot; about the &quot;Wiriyamu Massacre&quot; in Mozambique, revealing that the Portuguese Army had massacred some 400 villagers at the village of Wiriyamu, near Tete, in December 1972. His report was printed a week before the Portuguese prime minister, Marcelo Caetano, was due to visit Britain to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. Portugal&#x27;s growing isolation following Hastings&#x27;s claims has often been cited as a factor that helped to bring about the &quot;carnation revolution&quot; coup which deposed the Caetano regime in 1974.

The various conflicts forced the Salazar and subsequent Caetano governments to spend more of the country&#x27;s budget on colonial administration and military expenditures, and Portugal soon found itself increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. After Caetano succeeded to the prime ministership, the colonial war became a major cause of dissent and a focus for anti-government forces in Portuguese society. Many young dissidents, such as left-wing students and anti-war activists, were forced to leave the country so they could escape imprisonment or conscription. However, between 1945 and 1974, there were also three generations of militants of the radical right at the Portuguese universities and schools, guided by a revolutionary nationalism partly influenced by the political sub-culture of European neofascism. The core of the struggle of these radical students lay in an uncompromising defence of the Portuguese Empire in the days of the authoritarian regime.

By the early 1970s, the Portuguese Colonial War continued to rage on, requiring a steadily increasing budget. The Portuguese military was overstretched and there was no political solution or end in sight. While the human losses were relatively small, the war as a whole had already entered its second decade. The Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo faced criticism from the international community and was becoming increasingly isolated. It had a profound impact on Portugal – thousands of young men avoided conscription by emigrating illegally, mainly to France and the US.

The war in the colonies was increasingly unpopular in Portugal itself as the people became weary of war and balked at its ever-rising expense. Many ethnic Portuguese of the African overseas territories were also increasingly willing to accept independence if their economic status could be preserved. However, despite the guerrillas&#x27; unpredictable and sporadic attacks against targets all over the countryside of the Portuguese African territories, the economies of both Portuguese Angola and Mozambique were booming, cities and towns were expanding and prospering steadily over time, new transportation networks were being opened to link the well-developed and highly urbanized coastal strip with the more remote inland regions, and the number of ethnic European Portuguese migrants from mainland Portugal (the &quot;metrópole&quot;) increased rapidly since the 1950s (although always as a small minority of each territory&#x27;s total population).

Suddenly, after some failed attempts of military rebellion, in April 1974 the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, organized by left-wing Portuguese military officers – the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), overthrew the Estado Novo regime. The military-led coup can be described as the necessary means of bringing back democracy to Portugal, ending the unpopular Colonial War where thousands of Portuguese soldiers had been commissioned, and replacing the authoritarian &quot;Estado Novo&quot; (New State) regime and its secret police which repressed elemental civil liberties and political freedoms. However, the military coup&#x27;s organization started as a professional class protest of Portuguese Armed Forces captains against a decree law: the &quot;Dec. Lei nº 353/73&quot; of 1973. Younger military academy graduates resented a program introduced by Marcello Caetano whereby militia officers who completed a brief training program and had served in the overseas territories&#x27; defensive campaigns, could be commissioned at the same rank as military academy graduates. Caetano&#x27;s Portuguese Government had begun the program (which included several other reforms) in order to increase the number of officials employed against the African insurgencies, and at the same time cut down military costs to alleviate an already overburdened government budget. After the coup, the MFA-led National Salvation Junta, a military junta, took power. Caetano resigned, and was flown under custody to the Madeira Islands where he stayed for a few days. He then flew to exile in Brazil. By 1975 the Portuguese Empire had all but collapsed.

==Aftermath==
After the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; the country would then experience a turbulent period of provisional governments and a nearly disintegrated state reminiscent of the First Republic, a condition that the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; had with great care and perseverance attempted to avoid. These provisional governments also briefly censored newspapers and detained oppositionists. Historian Kenneth Maxwell considers that, for many reasons, Portugal, in its transition from authoritarian rule to a more democratic government, resembled Nicaragua more than any other among the South American nations. During the final months of the Francoist State, which had survived to this point, Spain considered invading Portugal to check the perceived threat of communism caused by the Carnation Revolution.

After a period of social unrest, factionalism, and uncertainty in Portuguese politics, between 1974 and 1976, neither far left nor far right radicalism prevailed. However, pro-communist and socialist elements retained control of the country for several months before elections. Álvaro Cunhal&#x27;s Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) remained Stalinist in outlook and unsympathetic to the sort of reforms that were emerging as &quot;Euro-Communism&quot; in other countries in Western Europe.

The retreat from the colonies and the acceptance of its independence terms which would create newly independent communist states in 1975 (most notably the People&#x27;s Republic of Angola and the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique) prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal&#x27;s African territories (mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique), creating over a million destitute Portuguese refugees — the &quot;retornados&quot;. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its first democratic elections in 50 years. However, the country continued to be governed by a military-civilian provisional administration until the Portuguese legislative election of 1976.

For the Portuguese and their former colonies, this was a very difficult period, but many felt that the short-term effects of the Carnation Revolution were well worth the trouble when civil rights and political freedoms were achieved. The Portuguese celebrate Freedom Day on 25 April every year, and the day is a national holiday in Portugal. By refusing to grant independence to its overseas territories in Africa, the Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo was criticized by most of the international community, and its leaders Salazar and Caetano were accused of being blind to the &quot;Winds of Change&quot;. After the Carnation revolution in 1974 and the fall of the incumbent Portuguese authoritarian regime, almost all the Portugal-ruled territories outside Europe became independent. For the regime, the retention of those overseas possessions had been a matter of national interest. Many previously successful Portuguese exporters (i.e. CUF and others) didn&#x27;t survive the far-left politics, labour movement-inspired PREC (1975) and its influence over the Portuguese economy, society and government policies, including the newly written Portuguese Constitution adopted in 1976. In the following decades, Portugal remained a net beneficiary of European Union Structural and Cohesion Funds and didn&#x27;t avoid three IMF-led bailouts between the late 1970s and the early 2010s. In 2011, during the Portuguese financial crisis when the country was nearing the end of the center-left government of José Socrates and had to request international financial assistance, Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, the Portuguese military officer who was the chief strategist of the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, stated that he wouldn&#x27;t have started the revolution if he had known what the country would become after it. He also stated that the country would need a man as honest as Salazar to deal with the crisis, but from a non-fascist perspective.

<text>Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle (Hieraaetus wahlbergi) is a bird of prey that is native to sub-Saharan Africa, where it is a seasonal migrant in the woodlands and savannas.
It is named after the Swedish naturalist Johan August Wahlberg. Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae.

==Description==

Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle is a medium-sized raptor, and the sexes are similar. It is about in length with a wingspan of and a body mass of for males and for females on average. The head has a small crest, and the legs are yellow. The plumage tone is variable but may be dark brown except for dark-streaked grey undersides to the flight feathers, and a barred grey undertail. Light and dark plumage phases occur. A pale variant may be much lighter brown with whitish, rather than grey undertail and flight feather undersides. The pale variant is much less common than the darker variant.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle is distributed from central Chad to the north-east coast of South Africa. Its western boundary is thought to be Cameroon, although it most commonly occurs further east across the continent.
Within this large range, it usually remains between sea-level and , but has also been documented at an altitude of in Ethiopia.

Wahlberg&#x27;s eagles cover large distances in short periods. In 1994, a female Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle was tracked over a period of 9 months, during which it covered over from northern Namibia to Chad and back; its range between breeding in the south and non-breeding areas in the north was , and it travelled over due north in just five days after leaving its breeding grounds.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle mainly hunts birds (including other raptors such as the Gabar goshawk and Barn owl), although it also feeds on reptiles (various lizards and snakes) and a few small mammals (Tree squirrels, Mongooses, Hares). It has also been recorded eating various Invertebrates such as termites, grasshoppers and beetles.

Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle breeds mainly in southern Africa during the October to February period. It builds a stick nest in the fork of a tree or the crown of a palm tree. Wahlberg&#x27;s eagles are monogamous and form long-term pair bonds. They are well known for complex and spectacular aerial courtship displays. They are very territorial and solitary nesters. The nest is often reused by the same pair through multiple years. Their breeding season occurs during the wet season of northern South Africa from October to February as food is more readily available. The female feeds the chicks with food provided by the male eagle.
Reductions in reproductive output were observed in the 1990s, which were thought to be related to increased population density in Wahlberg&#x27;s eagles; breeding success was highly density dependant, and resource availability did not play a part in this phenomenon.

==Taxonomy==

Studies of marker gene sequences (published 2004–2005) found Wahlberg&#x27;s eagle belonged to a clade containing &quot;Hieraaetus pennatus&quot;, &quot;H. morphnoides&quot;, &quot;H. ayeresii&quot;, and &quot;H. (m.) weiskei&quot;.
Since then, many taxonomic checklists changed from &quot;Aquila wahlbergi&quot; to &quot;Hieraaetus wahlbergi&quot;. However, the African Bird Club (as of the 2012 checklist) and the Second Southern African Bird Atlas Project (as of 2014) continue to keep &quot;Aquila wahlbergi&quot; separate from the &quot;Hieraaetus&quot; species.

<text>Robert Burgess Aldrich (August 9, 1918 – December 5, 1983) was an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. An iconoclastic and maverick &quot;auteur&quot; working in many genres during the Golden Age of Hollywood, he directed mainly films noir, war movies, westerns and dark melodramas with Gothic overtones. His most notable credits include &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; (1954), &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1955), &quot;The Big Knife&quot; (1955), &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; (1956), &quot;Attack&quot; (1956), &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962), &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964), &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (1965), &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (1974).

Containing a &quot;macho mise-en-scene and resonant reworkings of classic action genres,&quot; Aldrich&#x27;s films were known for pushing the boundaries of violence in mainstream cinema, as well as for their psychologically complex interpretations of genre film tropes. The British Film Institute wrote that Aldrich&#x27;s work displays &quot;a subversive sensibility in thrall to the complexities of human behaviour.&quot; Several of his films later proved influential to members of the French New Wave.

Aside from his directorial work, Aldrich was also noted for his advocacy as a member of the Directors Guild of America, serving as its president for two terms, and becoming the namesake for its Robert B. Aldrich Achievement Award.

==Early life==
===Family===
Robert Burgess Aldrich was born in Cranston, Rhode Island, into a family of wealth and social prominence – &quot;The Aldriches of Rhode Island&quot;. His father, Edward Burgess Aldrich (1871–1957) was the publisher of &quot;The Times&quot; of Pawtucket and an influential operative in state Republican politics. His mother, Lora Elsie (née Lawson) of New Hampshire (1874–1931), died when Aldrich was 13 and was remembered with fondness by her son. Ruth Aldrich Kaufinger (1912–1987) was his elder sister and only sibling.

Among his notable ancestors were the American Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene and the theologian Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island Colony.

His grandfather, Nelson Wilmarth Aldrich, was a self-made millionaire and art investor. A Republican member of the U.S. Senate for thirty years (1881–1911), he was dubbed &quot;General Manager of the Nation&quot; by the press for his dominant role in framing federal monetary policy.

A number of Aldrich&#x27;s paternal uncles had impressive careers, among them a successful investment banker, an architect and Harvard instructor, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and a chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank who also served as U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain. An aunt, Abigail Greene &quot;Abby&quot; Aldrich married John D. Rockefeller Jr., scion of the Standard Oil fortune, and was a leading figure in the establishment of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Nelson Rockefeller, a four-term governor of New York State and U.S. vice-president under Gerald Ford, and Rockefeller&#x27;s four brothers were the director&#x27;s first cousins.

===Education===
As the only male heir to the Lawson-Aldrich family line, Aldrich was under considerable pressure to compete successfully with his numerous cousins in a family of high achievers.

Following family tradition and expectations, Aldrich was educated at Moses Brown School in Providence from 1933 to 1937. There he served as captain of the track and football teams and was elected president of his senior class.

Failing to matriculate to Yale due to mediocre grades, Aldrich attended the University of Virginia from 1937 to 1941, majoring in economics. He continued to excel in sports and played a leading role in campus clubs and fraternities.

During the Great Depression, the adolescent Aldrich began to question the justice of his family&#x27;s &quot;politics and power&quot; which clashed with his growing sympathies with left-wing social and political movements of the 1930s. Aldrich&#x27;s disaffection from the Aldrich-Rockefeller right-wing social and political orientation contributed to a growing tension between father and son.

Having satisfactorily demonstrated his aptitude for a career in finance, Aldrich defied his father by dropping out of college in his senior year without taking a degree.

Aldrich approached his uncle Winthrop W. Aldrich, who got his 23-year-old nephew a job at RKO Studios as a production clerk at $25 a week. For this act of defiance, Aldrich was promptly disinherited. Aldrich reciprocated by expunging public records of his connection with the Aldrich-Rockefeller clan, while stoically accepting the breach. He rarely mentioned or invoked his family thereafter. It has been said that &quot;No American film director was born as wealthy as Aldrich — and then so thoroughly cut off from family money.&quot;

== RKO Pictures: 1941–1943 ==

At the age of 23, Aldrich began work at RKO Pictures as a production clerk, an entry-level position, after declining an offer through his Rockefeller connections to enter the studio as an associate producer.

He married his first wife, Harriet Foster, a childhood sweetheart, shortly before he departed for Hollywood in May 1941.

Though the smallest of Hollywood&#x27;s top studios, RKO could boast an impressive roster of directors (George Cukor, John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks) as well as movie stars (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn and the Marx Brothers). The 23-year-old Aldrich assumed his duties shortly after Orson Welles, at 26, signed a six-movie contract with RKO after the release of the widely acclaimed &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941).

When the United States entered the Second World War in December 1941, Aldrich was inducted into the Air Force Motion Picture Unit, but was quickly discharged when an old football injury disqualified him for military service. The film studios&#x27; manpower shortage allowed Aldrich to win assignments as third- or second-tier director&#x27;s assistant to learn the basics of filmmaking.

===Second assistant director===
In just two years he participated on two dozen movies with well-known directors. He was second assistant director on &quot;Joan of Paris&quot; (1942, directed by Robert Stevenson), &quot;The Falcon Takes Over&quot; (1942, directed by Irving Reis), &quot;The Big Street&quot; (1942), directed by Reis, &quot;Bombardier&quot; (1943, directed by Richard Wallace), &quot;Behind the Rising Sun&quot; (1943, directed by Edward Dmytryk), &quot;A Lady Takes a Chance&quot; (1943, directed by William A. Seiter), &quot;The Adventures of a Rookie&quot; (1943, directed by Leslie Goodwins), &quot;Gangway for Tomorrow&quot; (1943, directed by John H. Auer), and &quot;Rookies in Burma&quot; (1943, directed by Goodwins).

===First assistant director===
Towards the end of the war, Aldrich had risen to first assistant director making comedy shorts with director Leslie Goodwins.

In 1944, Aldrich departed RKO to begin free-lancing on feature films at other major studios, including Columbia, United Artists, and Paramount.

== Assistant director: 1944–1952 ==
Aldrich was fortunate to serve as an assistant director to many notable and talented Hollywood filmmakers. During these assignments, which spanned nine years, Aldrich gained both practical and aesthetic fundamentals of filmmaking: &quot;set location and atmosphere&quot; (Jean Renoir, &quot;The Southerner&quot;, 1945), the &quot;techniques of pre-planning a shot&quot; (Lewis Milestone&#x27;s &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot;, 1946), &quot;action scenes&quot; (William A. Wellman&#x27;s &quot;The Story of G.I. Joe&quot;, 1946), the &quot;importance of communication with actors&quot; (Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;The Prowler&quot;, 1951), and &quot;establishing visual empathy between camera and audience&quot; (Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Limelight&quot;, 1952).

He also worked on &quot;Pardon My Past&quot; (1945, directed by Leslie Fenton) and &quot;The Private Affairs of Bel Ami&quot; (1947, directed by Albert Lewin).

Aldrich approached these projects and directors with a fine discrimination, enabling him to learn from both their strengths and weaknesses.

During these years Aldrich forged lasting professional relationships with talented artists who would serve him throughout his filmmaking career, namely, cinematographer Joseph Biroc, film editor Michael Luciano, music director Frank De Vol, art director William Glasgow and screenwriter Lukas Heller. A troupe of loyal, mostly male, players were enlisted for his film leads and supporting roles: Burt Lancaster, Jack Palance, Lee Marvin, Eddie Albert, Richard Jaeckel, Wesley Addy, Ernest Borgnine and Charles Bronson.

=== Enterprise Productions: 1946–1948 ===
Aldrich&#x27;s association with Enterprise Productions marks the most formative period of his apprenticeship. The production company offered a unique venue of independent filmmakers welcoming socially conscious themes critical of authoritarian aspects of American society.

While at Enterprise, Aldrich established both a professional and a personal affiliation with screenwriter and director Abraham Polonsky, a major figure in the Popular Front movement of the 1930s. Their respective films addressed the issue of an individual&#x27;s often desperate struggle to resist destruction by an oppressive society.

Enterprise&#x27;s &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1947), written by Polonsky, directed by Robert Rossen, and starring John Garfield, made a deep and lasting impression on the 29-year-old assistant director from both structural and thematic standpoints. Garfield plays a corrupt prizefighter who seeks to redeem himself by defying mobsters who insist he throw a fight or forfeit his life. While the protagonist&#x27;s personal failings contribute to his own oppression, the film censures capitalism as an unredeemable system. Aldrich would revisit &quot;Body and Soul&quot; throughout his career when seeking guidance on how to convey the progressive ideals of the 1930s while working in the reactionary political atmosphere of the Cold War era.

In 1948 Aldrich joined Polonsky and Garfield on the noir film &quot;Force of Evil&quot;. The story concerns a Wall Street attorney turned mob lawyer (Garfield) who informs on his employers when they murder his brother. &quot;Force of Evil&quot;″s cinematically excessive visuals and striking sound would later appear in Aldrich&#x27;s films &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; and &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot;.

A number of Aldrich&#x27;s associates at Enterprise came under scrutiny by the HUAC in the late 1940s after Enterprise had closed its doors. Among them were Rossen, Polonsky, Garfield, directors John Berry, and Joseph Losey, producer Carl Foreman, and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, some of whom suffered blacklisting and imprisonment. Aldrich was never targeted by the authorities, despite his collaborations with these artists. This was largely due to his post-1930s entry into the film industry when recruitment by Communist and leftist organizations was declining. Nonetheless, Aldrich remained a champion for the victims of the Red Scare.

At Enterprise, Aldrich also worked as an assistant director on &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; (1948) and &quot;No Minor Vices&quot; (1948) for Lewis Milestone, &quot;So This Is New York&quot; (1948) for director Richard Fleischer and producer Stanley Kramer, and &quot;Caught&quot; (1949) for Max Ophüls.

During his apprenticeship Aldrich developed a keen appreciation for the nexus between autonomous control over every element of picture production and achievement of his creative vision. He would forever strive for full control over his films.

=== Freelance assistant director: 1948–1952 ===
After the demise of Enterprise, Aldrich continued to be in much demand as an assistant director. He worked again for Lewis Milestone on &quot;The Red Pony&quot; (1949) at Republic and did &quot;Red Light&quot; (1949) for Roy Del Ruth, &quot;A Kiss for Corliss&quot; (1949) for Richard Wallace, &quot;The White Tower&quot; (1950) for Ted Tetzlaff, &quot;M&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Prowler&quot; (1951) for Joseph Losey, and &quot;New Mexico&quot; (1951) for Reis.

Aldrich was assistant to producer Harold Hecht on &quot;Ten Tall Men&quot; (1951), a French Foreign Legion action film starring Burt Lancaster. He worked as production manager on &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; (1951) for Sam Spiegel and as production manager on &quot;The Steel Trap&quot; (1952) for Andrew L. Stone.

Hecht had enjoyed working with Aldrich on &quot;Ten Tall Men&quot; and used him on &quot;The First Time&quot; (1952), the feature directorial debut of Frank Tashlin.

Aldrich&#x27;s most notable credit to date came on &quot;Limelight&quot; (1952), for which he was assistant director to Charlie Chaplin. He was assistant on &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd&quot; (1952).

==Television: 1952–1954==
By 1952, the 34-year old assistant director, fully prepared to make his directorial debut, had no offers materializing in Hollywood. Eager to perform at a journeyman level, he moved to New York City to join its television startups.

The infant industries&#x27; golden age of live broadcasts was in a primitive stage of organization, and producers were pleased to enlist talent from the Hollywood film industry. More than merely a career move, television offered Aldrich an opportunity to apply the cinematic skills and concepts he had garnered during his eclectic education in movie-making to an entirely new medium.

&quot;All they were paying directors was scale&quot;, recalled Aldrich of this time. &quot;Who the hell wanted to go live in New York and work for scale? Only guys that had never directed or couldn&#x27;t get a shot... Walter Blake... convinced these people who were doing the Camay soap shows that I was a genius waiting behind a rock out here. I had been assistant director on a Chaplin picture, so he told them that I had directed Chaplin. Nobody directs Chaplin except Chaplin, but these guys didn&#x27;t know the difference. So I went back to New York and did, I don&#x27;t know, thirty or forty shows.&quot;

Procter &amp; Gamble hired Aldrich in 1952 to direct episodes of the anthology series &quot;The Doctor&quot; (later retitled &quot;The Guest&quot; in syndication), an early soap opera starring Warner Anderson. Shooting schedules were notoriously tight. Despite this, Aldrich routinely dedicated half or more of the allotted time to rehearsals, an immensely reassuring practice for the players that contributed to the efficient execution of the final live shoot.

Following &quot;The Doctor&quot;, Aldrich resettled in Hollywood to complete twenty episodes of television&#x27;s &quot;China Smith&quot; starring Dan Duryea, filmed on an even tighter timetable.

He also filled in as director on TV&#x27;s &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot; and the &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot; (&quot;The Pussyfootin&#x27; Rocks&quot;).

Aldrich described the early TV industry as a &quot;director&#x27;s crash course&quot; where, unlike feature film production, the overall quality of the series outweighed the success or failure of an individual episode. In his two-year stint in television, Aldrich was free to experiment with technique and narrative schemes that would appear later in his film treatments. As such, he used cinematic framing and composition to reveal character motivation and close ups serving to highlight dialog, all of which endowed his episodes with a polished Hollywood studio-like appearance. Aldrich avoided disparaging television as an art form, only regretting its &quot;rushed schedules and lack of preparation time.&quot;

==Feature film director==
===Early feature films===
In December 1951 Irving Allen announced he had formed Warwick Productions with Albert Broccoli. He intended to make &quot;The Gamma People&quot; with Robert Aldrich. In August 1952 Allen announced that Aldrich would make his feature debut as director with &quot;The Gamma People&quot;, to be shot in Europe in the winter from Aldrich&#x27;s own script. Dick Powell was slated to star. However, the film would not be made for several years, with Aldrich&#x27;s involvement limited to working on the story.

Aldrich broke into feature films as a director when Herbert Baker, who had worked with Aldrich on &quot;So This is New York&quot;, recommended the director to MGM, which was looking for someone with a background in sports for a low-budget baseball film, &quot;Big Leaguer&quot; (1953).

The film was not particularly successful, so Aldrich returned to television, doing episodes of &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, several of which were written by Blake Edwards. He directed &quot;The Witness&quot;, which starred Dick Powell, Strother Martin, and Charles Bronson, and &quot;The Bad Streak&quot; with Charles Boyer.

Aldrich remained ambitious to work in features and raised money for a low-budget action film called &quot;World for Ransom&quot; (1954), which used many of the same sets and cast members as &quot;China Smith&quot;, including star Dan Duryea. It was made for Plaza Productions and financed by Allied Artists; Aldrich produced and directed. The cinematographer was Joseph F. Biroc, who would shoot many of Aldrich&#x27;s later features.

===Burt Lancaster: &quot;Apache&quot; and &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;===
&quot;World for Ransom&quot; was seen by Harold Hecht and Burt Lancaster, who hired Aldrich to direct his first color film, &quot;Apache&quot; (1954), a western starring Lancaster as an Apache fighter. It was made for Hecht-Lancaster Productions and released through United Artists. This film was a big hit, earning $6 million.

Hecht and Lancaster used Aldrich again on &quot;Vera Cruz&quot; (1954), a western starring Gary Cooper and Lancaster. It was even more successful at the box office than &quot;Apache&quot;, making $9 million, and firmly established Aldrich as a director.

===Turning producer: &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, &quot;The Big Knife&quot; and &quot;Attack&quot;===
The success of these movies enabled Aldrich to set up his own company, The Associates and Aldrich, and sign a deal with United Artists. Its first movie was to be &quot;The Way We Are&quot; by Jack Jevne, about a woman who has an affair with a younger man. It was not immediately made.

Instead Aldrich produced and directed &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1955), a &quot;film noir&quot; adapted by A. I. Bezzerides from a novel by Mickey Spillane starring Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer. Breaking new grounds in its portrayal of sadistical violence, It was made for Parklane Productions, the independent company of Victor Saville, who owned the rights, and released through United Artists.

Aldrich and his company then made &quot;The Big Knife&quot; (1955), based on a play by Clifford Odets. Aldrich directed and produced this film about a movie star played by Jack Palance who rebels against Rod Steiger&#x27;s tyrannical Hollywood producer.

The Associates and Aldrich Company made a second film, also based on a play and released through United Artists, &quot;Attack&quot; (1956), starring Palance and Lee Marvin.

None of the three films was particularly successful at the box office, although they received some excellent reviews. In particular, &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; became a major cult favorite in France. &quot;I worked almost for nothing, economically, on those movies&quot;, he said. &quot;They got caught up in the system and were not profitable pictures.&quot; Aldrich said his experiences made him &quot;more cynical in terms of what preference to give survival and what preference to give material that might make a fine film which nobody or very few would go to see. That was the break. I realized that if you&#x27;re careful in choosing projects and setting costs your taste and knowledge will, out of every six or seven pictures, produce one that makes a good deal of profitable return for everybody.&quot;

The Associates announced numerous projects around this time, including &quot;Tryanny&quot;, &quot;Kinderspiel&quot;, &quot;Potluck for Pomeroy&quot;, &quot;Candidate for President&quot; (by Don Weis) and &quot;Machine for Chuparosa&quot;.

The Associates and Aldrich Company expanded to offer financing and distribution for other films. The only one that resulted was &quot;The Ride Back&quot; (1957) for UA. They wanted to make &quot;The Build Up Boys&quot; with Dana Andrews but the film did not eventuate (Dana Andrews eventually backed and starred in the movie, changed to Madison Avenue).

===Columbia: &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and &quot;The Garment Jungle&quot;===
In between making &quot;Big Knife&quot; and &quot;Attack&quot;, Aldrich directed the Joan Crawford melodrama &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; (1956) (originally &quot;The Way We Are&quot;), which was a minor hit.

Aldrich worked on the original story for the thriller &quot;The Gamma People&quot; (1956), made for Columbia and Warwick Productions in England.

In July 1956 Robert Aldrich signed a two-picture deal with Columbia to make films through his own company. The first was to be &quot;The Garment Jungle&quot; (1957). The second was to be &quot;Until Proven Guilty&quot;. He also acquired the John O&#x27;Hara story &quot;Now We Know&quot;.

Aldrich started directing &quot;Garment&quot; but was fired towards the end of filming and replaced by Vincent Sherman.

In March 1957 Aldrich sued Columbia for reneging on a promise to make a film of the play &quot;Storm in the Sun&quot;, which he wanted to do with Crawford. The case was settled the following month.

Aldrich announced a range of projects – &quot;Kinderspiel&quot;, &quot;Pommeroy&quot;, &quot;The Snipe Hunt&quot;, &quot;Until Proven Guilty&quot;, &quot;Now We Know&quot; – but he found it difficult to get financing.

The Associates and Aldrich had the rights to the script for &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; but ended up selling the project outright to Columbia.

===Europe===
Aldrich was unable to get a job until he had an offer from Hammer Films and Seven Arts to write and direct &quot;Ten Seconds to Hell&quot; (1959), starring Palance and Jeff Chandler, in Germany. While there, he was head of the jury at the 9th Berlin International Film Festival.

Aldrich stayed in Europe to make &quot;The Angry Hills&quot; (1959), based on the novel by Leon Uris and starring Robert Mitchum, for MGM in Greece for producer Raymond Stross. Aldrich had the film rewritten by Bezzerides, but then his cut of the film was re-edited by Stross. It was an unhappy experience for Aldrich and the film lost money.

Adlrich was going to make &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; in Yugoslavia with Anthony Quinn and a budget of $3 million, but the film did not proceed. Neither did another proposed subject, &quot;The Catalyst&quot;, based on a play by Ronald Duncan about male bisexuality. Aldrich would attempt to make &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; several times but ended up having to sell his script to Harold Hecht, who produced a film without Aldrich in 1962. Other projects he developed around this time include &quot;Angry Odyssey&quot;, &quot;The Left Bank&quot;, and &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;.

Aldrich returned to Hollywood to direct episodes of &quot;Hotel de Paree&quot; (&quot;Sundance Returns&quot;), and &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;.

He directed a western, &quot;The Last Sunset&quot; (1961), starring Kirk Douglas and Rock Hudson, made for Douglas&#x27;s company at Universal.

Aldrich tried to make &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; with John Mills but could not get financing.

Aldrich then went back to Italy, where he directed the Biblical spectacular &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; (1962) for Joseph E. Levine. Aldrich disparaged the final film, which ended up costing $6 million.

===Warner Bros: &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; and &quot;4 For Texas&quot;===
Aldrich rejuvenated his career by optioning the novel &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962) for the Associates and Aldrich Company. He signed Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as stars, got Lukas Heller to write the script, and raised financing through Warner Bros. The film was a massive hit at the box office and earned five Academy Award nominations (including a win for black-and-white costume design), restoring Aldrich&#x27;s commercial and critical reputation. It also revived the popularity of Davis and Crawford as box office draws and led to a subgenre of horror movies starring elder actresses nicknamed &quot;Psycho-biddy&quot;. It also started a run of films (continued in &quot;Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte&quot; and others) with a gothic, camp sensibility that became an immediate hit with queer audiences.

Still at Warners, Aldrich wrote, produced and directed a comic western with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, &quot;4 for Texas&quot; (1963). Made for Sam Productions, it had Charles Bronson, Victor Buono, Ursula Andress and Anita Ekberg in supporting roles. The film was reasonably popular at the box office, but Aldrich disliked working with Sinatra and the resulting film.

===20th Century Fox: &quot;Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot;===
Emboldened by his recent commercial successes, Aldrich announced a $14 million production program of eight films, including &quot;Cross of Iron&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to Cousin Charlotte&quot;, &quot;The Tsar&#x27;s Bride&quot;, &quot;Brouhaha&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot;, &quot;Paper Eagle&quot;, &quot;Genghis Khan&#x27;s Bicycle&quot;, and &quot;There Really Was a Gold Mine&quot; a sequel to &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;. He had prepared scripts on &quot;Now We Know&quot;, &quot;Vengeance Is Mine&quot;, &quot;Potluck for Pomeroy&quot; and &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;. Other projects were &quot;The Strong Are Lonely&quot;, &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot; and the TV series &quot;The Man&quot;.

He started with a follow-up to &quot;Baby Jane&quot;, &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964), made for the Associates and Aldrich at 20th Century Fox. Bette Davis starred as a Southern woman who lives in a mansion and thinks she is going insane. Davis was to be reunited with Joan Crawford, but Crawford left the film and was replaced by Olivia de Havilland. The movie was popular, though not as successful as &quot;Baby Jane&quot;.

Aldrich stayed at Fox for his next film, the all-male action story &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; (1965), with James Stewart, Richard Attenborough and Peter Finch. The film was a commercial disappointment but eventually proved profitable.

===MGM: &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot;===
Aldrich had his biggest hit to date with &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), produced by Kenneth Hyman&#x27;s Seven Arts Productions and released through MGM. Starring Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Ernest Borgnine and John Cassavetes, the film was a massive success at the box office.

Aldrich stayed at MGM for &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot; (1968) starring Finch and Kim Novak, made for Aldrich&#x27;s own company. It was a critical and commercial disappointment.

===Aldrich Studios===
Aldrich sold his profit participation in &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; to MGM for $1,350,000 and used the money to achieve a long-time dream – to buy his own studios, which he called the Aldrich Studios. He picked a facility at 201 North Occidental Boulevard, which had been in existence as a film studio since 1913, making Mary Pickford movies, and had recently been the basis of Sutherland Productions. Aldrich had made &quot;The Big Knife&quot; there.

&quot;My dream has always been to own my own studio&quot;, he said. &quot;With the possible exception of the old Enterprise Studio back in &#x27;45 I&#x27;ve never seen a studio run the way it should. That&#x27;s because everybody at Enterprise felt they could make a contribution
and that&#x27;s the feeling I hope we can have here.&quot;

The studios were opened in August 1968. Along with Goldwyn, The Associates and Aldrich was the only major independent company with a studio in Hollywood. For the next few years he would make his movies there.

===ABC Pictures===
Aldrich&#x27;s success with &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; led to the newly formed ABC Pictures offer the Associates and Aldrich Company a four-film contract. Aldrich announced they would be &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Mother of Them All&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice&quot; and &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot;.

Aldrich&#x27;s first film for ABC was &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot; (1968), adapted from by Lukas Heller from the play by Frank Marcus. It starred Beryl Reid and Susannah York and was notable for its frank depiction of a lesbian relationship. The movie was popular but because of its high cost lost money.

Aldrich produced but did not direct &quot;What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?&quot; (1969), a psycho-biddy thriller in the vein of &quot;Baby Jane&quot; directed by Lee H. Katzin and starring Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon. It also lost money. (Aldrich announced he would make a third &quot;Whatever Happened to&quot; film, &quot;Whatever Happened to Dear Elva?&quot; based on the novel &quot;Goodbye, Dear Elva&quot; by Elizabeth Fenwick. However no film was made.)

Aldrich made a 20-minute demo film, &quot;The Greatest Mother of Them All&quot; (1969), in an attempt to raise money for a feature-length version, but was unable to attract interest from ABC. Peter Finch starred.

ABC wanted Aldrich to make a war film in the vein of &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; so he produced and directed &quot;Too Late the Hero&quot; (1970), a &quot;patrol&quot; film, which he had been developing since 1959. Despite starring Michael Caine and Cliff Robertson and location work in the Philippines, the film made an overall loss of $6,765,000, making it one of the biggest money losers in the history of ABC Films.

Aldrich&#x27;s next film for ABC was &quot;The Grissom Gang&quot; (1971), an adaptation of &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; set in the 1930s, with Scott Wilson and Kim Darby. It was another flop, losing ABC $3,670,000.

Films Aldrich announced but did not make around this time included &quot;Rebellion&quot;, a western about Victoriano Huerta with Ernest Borgnine and George Kennedy, and &quot;The Movement&quot;, about student protest. He also developed scripts for books which were turned into films by others: &quot;Coffee, Tea or Me?&quot; and &quot;Monte Walsh&quot;.

By now Aldrich&#x27;s relationship with ABC had become fraught and devolved into lawsuits, in part caused by ABC refusing to finance other Aldrich projects. Aldrich parted company with ABC and in January 1972 put his studios up for sale.

In a 1972 interview Aldrich said that:
Lasting power is the most important power. Especially in this business, staying at the plate or staying at the table, staying in the game, is the essential. You can&#x27;t allow yourself to get passed over or pushed aside. Very, very talented people got pushed aside and remained unused... If you must make a choice between luck and talent, you have to opt for luck. It&#x27;s nice to have some of both, or a lot of both; but if you can&#x27;t, luck is the answer. Nowhere else more so than in this business. The right place, the right time, the right script, all the right auspices—they made the difference to directors, writers, actors.

===&quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; and &quot;Emperor of the North Pole&quot;===
Aldrich returned to westerns with &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; (1972), made at Universal for the Associates and Aldrich with producer Carter De Haven. It reteamed Aldrich with Lancaster for the first time since &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;. The film was a commercial disappointment but has subsequently come to be regarded as one of his finest films.

Aldrich followed it with &quot;Emperor of the North Pole&quot; (1973), a story of railway hobos in the 1930s starring Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine. Produced by Hyman at 20th Century Fox, it was another box office failure, though it too has seen its reputation soar in recent years (Leonard Maltin gave it 3 1/2 stars, calling it &quot;unusual, exciting&quot; and a &quot;unique entertainment&quot;).

===Two with Burt Reynolds: &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; and &quot;Hustle&quot;===
Aldrich&#x27;s commercial fortunes were revived with a prison comedy starring Burt Reynolds,&quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (1974). Made for producer Albert S. Ruddy at Paramount, it was Aldrich&#x27;s biggest hit since &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;.

Aldrich and Reynolds promptly reteamed on &quot;Hustle&quot; (1975), made for their own production company RoBurt and released through Paramount. A tough police drama co-starring Catherine Deneuve, it was another box office success. However, tension between Aldrich and Reynolds during filming meant they made no more movies together. In 1975 Aldrich was elected president of the Directors Guild of America and served two two-year terms.

===Lorimar: &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; and &quot;The Choirboys&quot;===
Aldrich signed a two-picture deal with Lorimar Productions, a TV company which wanted to move into features.

The first was &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; (1977), an action thriller starring Lancaster. The second was a comedy, &quot;The Choirboys&quot; (1977), based on the best selling novel by Joseph Wambaugh, which Wambaugh disliked so much he sued to get his name taken off the film.

===Final films: &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; and &quot;All the Marbles&quot;===
Aldrich&#x27;s last movies were comedies: &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot; (1979), set in the West with Gene Wilder and Harrison Ford, and &quot;...All the Marbles&quot; (1981), set in the world of female wrestling with Peter Falk. Neither was particularly popular.

When the latter film came out, Aldrich said, &quot;I&#x27;m 63 and I&#x27;ve had hits every ten years and I just hope I can function long enough to have one in the 90s.&quot;

==Personal life==
From his marriage to Harriet Foster (1941–1965), Aldrich had four children, all of whom work in the film business—Adell, William, Alida and Kelly. In 1966, after divorcing Foster, he married fashion model Sibylle Siegfried.

==Death and legacy==
Aldrich died of kidney failure on December 5, 1983, in a Los Angeles hospital. He is buried in Lot 5153 of the Whispering Trees Section of Forest Lawn Cemetery in Hollywood Hills.

Film critic John Patterson summarized his career in 2012: &quot;He was a punchy, caustic, macho and pessimistic director, who depicted corruption and evil unflinchingly, and pushed limits on violence throughout his career. His aggressive and pugnacious film-making style, often crass and crude, but never less than utterly vital and alive, warrants — and will richly reward — your immediate attention.&quot;

In 2012, John Patterson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that Aldrich is &quot;a wonderful director nearly 30 years dead now, whose body of work is in danger of slipping over the horizon.&quot; Japanese film director Kiyoshi Kurosawa noted Aldrich&#x27;s influence on him.

In the FX miniseries &quot;Feud: Bette and Joan&quot;, Aldrich is portrayed by British-born actor Alfred Molina. The series follows the productions of &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; and &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte.&quot;

<text>Repeated sequences (also known as repetitive elements, repeating units or repeats) are short or long patterns that occur in multiple copies throughout the genome. In many organisms, a significant fraction of the genomic DNA is repetitive, with over two-thirds of the sequence consisting of repetitive elements in humans. Some of these repeated sequences are necessary for maintaining important genome structures such as telomeres or centromeres.

Repeated sequences are categorized into different classes depending on features such as structure, length, location, origin, and mode of multiplication. The disposition of repetitive elements throughout the genome can consist either in directly adjacent arrays called tandem repeats or in repeats dispersed throughout the genome called interspersed repeats. Tandem repeats and interspersed repeats are further categorized into subclasses based on the length of the repeated sequence and/or the mode of multiplication.

While some repeated DNA sequences are important for cellular functioning and genome maintenance, other repetitive sequences can be harmful. Many repetitive DNA sequences have been linked to human diseases such as Huntington&#x27;s disease and Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia. Some repetitive elements are neutral and occur when there is an absence of selection for specific sequences depending on how transposition or crossing over occurs. However, an abundance of neutral repeats can still influence genome evolution as they accumulate over time. Overall, repeated sequences are an important area of focus because they can provide insight into human diseases and genome evolution.

== History ==
In the 1950s, Barbara McClintock first observed DNA transposition and illustrated the functions of the centromere and telomere at the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium. McClintock&#x27;s work set the stage for the discovery of repeated sequences because transposition, centromere structure, and telomere structure are all possible through repetitive elements, yet this was not fully understood at the time. The term &quot;repeated sequence&quot; was first used by Roy John Britten and D. E. Kohne in 1968; they found out that more than half of the eukaryotic genomes were repetitive DNA through their experiments on reassociation of DNA. Although the repetitive DNA sequences were conserved and ubiquitous, their biological role was yet unknown. In the 1990s, more research was conducted to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of minisatellite and microsatellite repeats because of their importance in DNA-based forensics and molecular ecology. DNA-dispersed repeats were increasingly recognized as a potential source of genetic variation and regulation. Discoveries of deleterious repetitive DNA-related diseases stimulated further interest in this area of study. In the 2000s, the data from full eukaryotic genome sequencing enabled the identification of different promoters, enhancers, and regulatory RNAs which are all coded by repetitive regions. Today, the structural and regulatory roles of repetitive DNA sequences remain an active area of research.

== Types and functions ==

Many repeat sequences are likely to be non-functional, decaying remnants of Transposable elements, these have been labelled &quot;junk&quot; or &quot;selfish&quot; DNA. Nevertheless, occasionally some repeats may be exapted for other functions.

=== Tandem repeats ===
Tandem repeats are repeated sequences which are directly adjacent to each other in the genome. Tandem repeats may vary in the number of nucleotides comprising the repeated sequence, as well as the number of times the sequence repeats. When the repeating sequence is only 2–10 nucleotides long, the repeat is referred to as a short tandem repeat (STR) or microsatellite. When the repeating sequence is 10–60 nucleotides long, the repeat is referred to as a minisatellite. For minisatellites and microsatellites, the number of times the sequence repeats at a single locus can range from twice to hundreds of times.

Tandem repeats have a wide variety of biological functions in the genome. For example, minisatellites are often hotspots of meiotic homologous recombination in eukaryotic organisms. Recombination is when two homologous chromosomes align, break, and rejoin to swap pieces. Recombination is important as a source of genetic diversity, as a mechanism for repairing damaged DNA, and a necessary step in the appropriate segregation of chromosomes in meiosis. The presence of repeated sequence DNA makes it easier for areas of homology to align, thereby controlling when and where recombination occurs.

In addition to playing an important role in recombination, tandem repeats also play important structural roles in the genome. For example, telomeres are composed mainly of tandem TTAGGG repeats. These repeats fold into highly organized G quadruplex structures which protect the ends of chromosomal DNA from degradation. Repetitive elements are enriched in the middle of chromosomes as well. Centromeres are the highly compact regions of chromosomes which join sister chromatids together and also allow the mitotic spindle to attach and separate sister chromatids during cell division. Centromeres are composed of a 177 base pair tandem repeat named the α-satellite repeat. Pericentromeric heterochromatin, the DNA which surrounds the centromere and is important for structural maintenance, is composed of a mixture of different satellite subfamilies including the α-, β- and γ-satellites as well as HSATII, HSATIII, and sn5 repeats.

Some repetitive sequences, such as those with structural roles discussed above, play roles necessary for proper biological functioning. Other tandem repeats have deleterious roles which drive diseases. Many other tandem repeats, however, have unknown or poorly understood functions.

=== Interspersed repeats ===
Interspersed repeats are identical or similar DNA sequences which are found in different locations throughout the genome. Interspersed repeats are distinguished from tandem repeats in that the repeated sequences are not directly adjacent to each other but instead may be scattered among different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome. Most interspersed repeats are transposable elements (TEs), mobile sequences which can be &quot;cut and pasted&quot; or &quot;copied and pasted&quot; into different places in the genome. TEs were originally called &quot;jumping genes&quot; for their ability to move, yet this term is somewhat misleading as not all TEs are discrete genes.

Transposable elements that are transcribed into RNA, reverse-transcribed into DNA, then reintegrated into the genome are called retrotransposons. Just as tandem repeats are further subcategorized based on the length of the repeating sequence, there are many different types of retrotransposons. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) are typically 3–7 kilobases in length. Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are typically 100-300 base pairs and no longer than 600 base pairs. Long-terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRs) are a third major class of retrotransposons and are characterized by highly repetitive sequences as the ends of the repeat. When a transposable element does not proceed through RNA as an intermediate, it is called a DNA transposon. Other classification systems refer to retrotransposons as &quot;Class I&quot; and DNA transposons as &quot;Class II&quot; transposable elements.

Transposable elements are estimated to constitute 45% of the human genome. Since uncontrolled propagation of TEs could wreak havoc on the genome, many regulatory mechanisms have evolved to silence their spread, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including small interfering RNA (siRNA), chromatin remodelers, histone variants, and other epigenetic factors. However, TEs play a wide variety of important biological functions. When TEs are introduced into a new host, such as from a virus, they increase genetic diversity. In some cases, host organisms find new functions for the proteins which arise from expressing TEs in an evolutionary process called TE exaptation. Recent research also suggests that TEs serve to maintain higher-order chromatin structure and 3D genome organization. Furthermore, TEs contribute to regulating the expression of other genes by serving as distal enhancers and transcription factor binding sites.

The prevalence of interspersed elements in the genome has garnered attention for more research on their origins and functions. Some specific interspersed elements have been characterized, such as the Alu repeat and LINE1.

===Intrachromosomal recombination===

Homologous recombination between chromosomal repeated sequences in somatic cells of &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot; was found to be increased by exposure to mitomycin C, a bifunctional alkylating agent that crosslinks DNA strands. This increase in recombination was attributed to increased intrachromosomal recombinational repair. By this process, mitomycin C damaged DNA in one sequence is repaired using intact information from the other repeated sequence.

=== Direct and inverted repeats ===
While tandem and interspersed repeats are distinguished based on their location in the genome, direct and inverted repeats are distinguished based on the ordering of the nucleotide bases. Direct repeats occur when a nucleotide sequence is repeated with the same directionality. Inverted repeats occur when a nucleotide sequence is repeated in the inverse direction. For example, a direct repeat of &quot;CATCAT&quot; would be another repetition of &quot;CATCAT&quot;. In contrast, the inverted repeated would be &quot;ATGATG&quot;. When there are no nucleotides separating the inverted repeat, such as &quot;CATCATATGATG&quot;, the sequence is called a palindromic repeat. Inverted repeats can play structural roles in DNA and RNA by forming stem loops and cruciforms.

== Repeated sequences in human disease ==
For humans, some repeated DNA sequences are associated with diseases. Specifically, tandem repeat sequences, underlie several human disease conditions, particularly trinucleotide repeat diseases such as Huntington&#x27;s disease, fragile X syndrome, several spinocerebellar ataxias, myotonic dystrophy and Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia. Trinucleotide repeat expansions in the germline over successive generations can lead to increasingly severe manifestations of the disease. These trinucleotide repeat expansions may occur through strand slippage during DNA replication or during DNA repair synthesis. It has been noted that genes containing pathogenic CAG repeats often encode proteins that themselves have a role in the DNA damage response and that repeat expansions may impair specific DNA repair pathways. Faulty repair of DNA damages in repeat sequences may cause further expansion of these sequences, thus setting up a vicious cycle of pathology.

=== Huntington&#x27;s disease ===

Huntington&#x27;s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which is due to the expansion of repeated trinucleotide sequence CAG in exon 1 of the &quot;huntingtin&quot; gene (&quot;HTT&quot;). This gene is responsible for encoding the protein huntingtin which plays a role in preventing apoptosis, otherwise known as cell death, and repair of oxidative DNA damage. In Huntington&#x27;s disease the expansion of the trinucleotide sequence CAG encodes for a mutant huntingtin protein with an expanded polyglutamine domain. This domain causes the protein to form aggregates in nerve cells preventing normal cellular function and resulting in neurodegeneration.
=== Fragile X syndrome ===
Fragile X syndrome is caused by the expansion of the DNA sequence CCG in the &quot;FMR1&quot; gene on the X chromosome. This gene produces the RNA-binding protein FMRP. In the case of Fragile X syndrome the repeated sequence makes the gene unstable and therefore silences the gene &quot;FMR1.&quot; Because the gene resides on the X chromosome, females who have two X chromosomes are less effected than males who only have on X chromosome and one Y chromosome because the second X chromosome can compensate for the silencing of the gene on the other X chromosome.

=== Spinocerebellar ataxias ===
The disease spinocerebellar ataxias has CAG trinucleotide repeat sequences that underlie several types of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs-SCA1; SCA2; SCA3; SCA6; SCA7; SCA12; SCA17). Similar to Huntington&#x27;s disease, the polyglutamine tail created due to this trinucleotide expansion causes aggregation of proteins, preventing normal cellular function and causing neurodegeneration.

=== Friedreich&#x27;s Ataxia ===
Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia is a type of ataxia that has an expanded repeat sequence GAA in the frataxin gene. The frataxin gene is responsible for producing the frataxin protein, which is a mitochondrial protein involved in energy production and cellular respiration. The expanded GAA sequence results in the silencing of the first intron resulting in loss of function in the frataxin protein. The loss of a functional &quot;FXN&quot; gene leads to issues with mitochondrial functioning as a whole and can present phenotypically in patients as difficulty walking.

=== Myotonic dystrophy ===
Myotonic dystrophy is a disorder that presents as muscle weakness and consists of two main types: DM1 and DM2. Both types of myotonic dystrophy are due to expanded DNA sequences. In DM1 the DNA sequence that is expanded is CTG while in DM2 it is CCTG. These two sequences are found on different genes with the expanded sequence in DM2 being found on the &quot;ZNF9&quot; gene and the expanded sequence in DM1 found on the &quot;DMPK&quot; gene. The two genes don&#x27;t encode for proteins unlike other disorders like Huntington&#x27;s disease or Fragile X syndrome. It has been shown, however, that there is a link between RNA toxicity and the repeat sequences in DM1 and DM2.

=== Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Frontotemporal dementia ===
Not all diseases caused by repeated DNA sequences are trinucleotide repeat diseases. The diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia are caused by hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat sequences in the &quot;C9orf72&quot; gene, causing RNA toxicity that leads to neurodegeneration.

== Biotechnology ==
Repetitive DNA is hard to sequence using next-generation sequencing techniques because sequence assembly from short reads simply cannot determine the length of a repetitive part. This issue is particularly serious for microsatellites, which are made of tiny 1-6bp repeat units. Although they are difficult to sequence, these short repeats have great value in DNA fingerprinting and evolutionary studies. Many researchers have historically left out repetitive sequences when analyzing and publishing whole genome data due to technical limitations.

Bustos. et al. proposed one method of sequencing long stretches of repetitive DNA. The method combines the use of a linear vector for stabilization and exonuclease III for deletion of continuing simple sequence repeats (SSRs) rich regions. First, SSR-rich fragments are cloned into a linear vector that can stably incorporate tandem repeats up to 30kb. Expression of repeats is prohibited by the transcriptional terminators in the vector. The second step involves the use of exonuclease III. The enzyme can delete nucleotide at the 3&#x27; end which results in the production of a unidirectional deletion of SSR fragments. Finally, this product which has deleted fragments is multiplied and analyzed with colony PCR. The sequence is then built by an ordered sequencing of a set of clones containing different deletions.

<text>Yotvingians (also called: Sudovians, Jatvians, or Jatvingians; Yotvingian: &quot;Jotvingai&quot;; , ; ; , , ) were a Western Baltic people who were closely tied to the Old Prussians. The linguist Petras Būtėnas asserts that they were closest to the Lithuanians. The Yotvingians contributed to the formation of the Lithuanian state.

== Culture ==

=== Etymology ===
According to Vytautas Mažiulis, the name Sūduva derives from a local hydronym &quot;*Sūd(a)vā&quot;, derived from a Baltic verbal root, &quot;*sū-&quot;: to flow, pour.

=== Language ===
Numerous linguists consider the Yotvingian language as a dialect of the Old Prussian language. The Lithuanian linguist Petras Būtėnas states that such an opinion is incorrect, because the Lithuanian predominates in Yotvingian toponymy instead of the Old Prussian . The Lithuanian professor Zigmas Zinkevičius wrote that the Yotvingians spoke a dialect of Western Baltic that was closer to Lithuanian than Prussian. The only known written source of the Yotvingian language is the manuscript &quot;&quot;.

== Geography ==
The Yotvingians lived in the area of Sudovia (Yotvingia) and Dainava, southwest from the upper Nemunas river. Today, this area corresponds mostly to the Podlaskie Voivodeship in Poland, portions of Lithuania west of the Nemunas and a part of Hrodna Province in Belarus. The territory was between the later cities of Marijampolė and Merkinė (Lithuania), Slonim and Kobryn (Belarus), and Białystok and Lyck in Prussia (now Ełk, Poland). 

Before the 10th century, in the south, Yotvingian homesteads reached the Brest area. In the west, they reached the Narew river basin. In the north, they reached the Vilnius&#x27; and Kaunas&#x27; southern outskirts. The territory was shrinking over time.

==History==
=== Ancient history ===
According to &quot;The Histories&quot; of Herodotus &quot;(5th century B.C.)&quot;, the Neuri (Νευροί) were a tribe living beyond the Scythian cultivators, one of the nations along the course of the river Hypanis (Bug river), west of the Borysthenes (Dniepr river). This was roughly the area of modern Belarus and Eastern Poland by the Narew river, coinciding with the Yotvingian linguistic territory of toponyms and hydronyms (Narew river) and the Scythian tribe of the Aroteres to the south-east.
Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD called the people &quot;Galindai kai Soudinoi&quot; (Σουδινοί). Peter of Dusburg called them &quot;Galindite and Suduwite&quot;. In the Hypatian Codex the spelling changes: &quot;Jatviagy, Jatviezie, Jatviažin, zemlia Jatveskaja, na zemliu Jatviažs´kuju&quot; and more. Polish sources also used Russian spellings: &quot;Jazviagi, Iazvizite, Jazvizite, Yazvizite&quot;. 

This name was taken by the papal administration: &quot;terra Jatwesouie, Gretuesia, Gzestuesie, Getuesia und Getvesia&quot;. The Knights called this tribe &quot;Sudowite, Sudowia, in qua Sudowit&quot;. and the Scythian tribe of the Aroteres to the south-east.

=== 10th century ===
In 944, during the treaty between the Kievan Rus&#x27; prince Igor and the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, the Yotvingians were hired by the Kievan ruler to serve as mercenaries. In 983, Vladimir I of Kiev hired the Yotvingians to add to his army.

=== 13th century ===

In two dotations, in 1253 and 1259, by Mindaugas, a new name was recorded: &quot;Dainava, Deynowe, Dainowe, Denowe&quot; (land of songs). The forests were named &quot;Deinova Jatvež&quot;. In the 1260 treaty with the Teutonic Knights, the region is called &quot;terre Getuizintarum&quot;. Skalmantas, leader of the Yotvingians was responsible for single-handedly raiding Pinsk in the Principality of Turov.

=== 14th century ===
In the sentence of Breslau of the emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg to the Livonian Order from 1325, this area is called &quot;Suderlandt alias Jetuen&quot;.

=== 15th century ===
Vytautas the Great wrote about &quot;terra Sudorum&quot;, in a letter to King Sigismund of March 11, 1420.

A 1860 census by the clergy of the Belarus Grodno area, had 30,929 inhabitants identifying as Yatviags.

<doc id="577729" wikidata="Q7307779" url="?curid=577729" title="Reg Goodwin">
<text>Sir Reginald Eustace Goodwin CBE, DL (3 July 1908 – 29 September 1986) was a British politician. He was Leader of the Greater London Council from 1973 to 1977. On the moderate wing of the Labour Party, he favoured public control of utilities.

==Family background==

Goodwin was from a middle-class family of five and was born in Streatham. He went to Strand School, leaving at 16 to become a tea-buyer for a City firm. In his spare time he worked at the Oxford and Bermondsey Boys&#x27; Club, a charity set up by the University of Oxford to help underprivileged boys in Bermondsey, where he then lived. Through this work he became full-time Assistant Secretary of the National Association of Boys&#x27; Clubs when it was established in 1934. From 1945 he was its General Secretary.

==Party politics==

Goodwin joined the Labour Party in 1932, and began his political career when he was elected to Bermondsey Borough Council in 1937. 

His administrative ability was noticed and he became Leader of the Council in the 1940s. Meanwhile, he had been elected in Bermondsey West at the 1946 London County Council election, where Labour Leader Sir Isaac Hayward spotted his potential and gave him important committee assignments.

==GLC membership==
Goodwin became a member of the Greater London Council for Southwark after its first election in 1964 and chaired the Finance Committee in the Labour administration. After the Conservatives won a landslide election victory in 1967 he was chosen as the new Labour Leader almost by default, other more dynamic personalities having been defeated. He was knighted on the recommendation of Harold Wilson in the 1968 New Year Honours and was almost always known as &#x27;Sir Reg&#x27; thereafter.

After the second defeat in 1970 Goodwin became more aggressive in his opposition to Sir Desmond Plummer&#x27;s Conservative GLC. Labour had not opposed the Conservative GLC&#x27;s policy of building urban motorways in 1970 but by June 1972 Goodwin had been convinced by the strength of public opinion, and said &quot;Labour pledges itself to abandon the disastrous plans to build two motorways which threaten the environment of Central London&quot;. He called on the GLC not to enter into contracts to build the motorways so that Londoners could have a choice at the 1973 elections.

At the 1973 elections, the Labour manifesto was drafted by Peter Walker, then Research Officer for the London Labour Party. It had a distinctly left-wing approach favouring subsidies to reduce (possibly eliminate) public transport fares and to build more council homes, but Goodwin supported these policies and gave his backing to the manifesto which was published under the title &quot;A Socialist Strategy for London&quot;.

==GLC Leader==
The Motorway Box issue and commitment to better public transport was the key to Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1973 election. After the election Sir Reg appointed Peter Walker to head his private office despite protests from the Conservatives and the GLC officers. This was the first ever open political appointment in the history of British local government and soon set the template for other similar appointments.

Sir Reg then changed the whole political decision making process in the GLC, ensuring that officers left after presenting their papers to the Labour cabinet who then made a decision and Peter Walker acted as secretary conveying the decisions to the Officers after going through the Labour group. By this manner Goodwin managed to continue the distinctly green agenda set in the 1973 manifesto despite many economic problems nationally that affected the GLC&#x27;s finances.

==Financial crisis==
Soon after the election the increase in inflation during this period caused havoc with the GLC finances. Goodwin was forced to cut investment programmes and increase transport fares and as a result became unpopular with the left. His attempts to conciliate with them caused resignations among the right-wing Labour councillors. Goodwin&#x27;s exceptionally discreet personal style meant that he was rarely targeted personally, but left him with few political friends.

He was re-elected Leader when Labour lost the 1977 GLC election but few expected him to continue in the post. He announced his resignation very suddenly by leaving 28 copies (one for every member of the Labour Group) of a resignation letter on the desk of the Chief Whip, with a note suggesting he might like to distribute them. On taking his seat on the backbenches he remarked &quot;I&#x27;m glad to be sitting here, because fewer of my friends are behind me.&quot;

==Deselection==
Goodwin&#x27;s own constituency party in Bermondsey had swung to the left. Although they wished him well personally and respected his contribution, the Bermondsey left insisted on a new candidate for the 1981 election and deselected him. He let his membership of the Labour Party lapse in 1982, but was declared an honorary member on 21 February 1983.

==Personal life==
Goodwin and his wife, Pen, had three children. He died at a nursing home in West Sussex on 29 September 1986, aged 78, after a long illness.

<text>The Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) was a part of the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) between 1995 and 2 July 2001. At the time it was the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest science and technology organisation. It was regarded by its official history as &#x27;a jewel in the crown&#x27; of both government and industry.

== Formation and operation ==
DERA was formed in April 1995 as an amalgamation of: 
*Defence Research Agency (DRA) which was set up in April 1991 and comprised 
**Royal Aerospace Establishment (RAE)
**Admiralty Research Establishment (ARE)
**Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE)
**Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE)
*Defence Test and Evaluation Organisation (DTEO)
*Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment (CBDE at Porton Down), which became part of the Protection and Life Sciences Division (PLSD)
*Centre for Defence Analysis (CDA).

The chief executive throughout DERA&#x27;s existence was John Chisholm. DERA&#x27;s staffing level was around 9,000 scientists, technologists and support staff.

== Dissolution ==
DERA was split into two organisations, based on short-lived transition bodies known as PDERA (&quot;privatised&quot; DERA) - becoming a commercial firm, QinetiQ - and &quot;RDERA&quot; ( &quot;retained&quot; in Government DERA) - becoming the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl).

At the split, QinetiQ was formed from the majority (about 3/4 of the staff and most of the facilities) of DERA, with Dstl assuming responsibility for those aspects which were best done in government. A few examples of the work undertaken by Dstl include nuclear, chemical, and biological research. In the time since the split both organisations have undergone significant change programmes. QinetiQ has increased its focus on overseas research with a number of US and other foreign acquisitions, whereas Dstl has a major rationalisation programme.

<text>Spectrum News 1 North Carolina is an American cable news television channel owned by Charter Communications, as an affiliate of its Spectrum News slate of regional news channels. The channel broadcasts rolling newscasts 24-hours a day, seven days a week, focused primarily on the state of North Carolina, with the exception of some special programming, including weekly in-depth program &quot;In Focus&quot;, a weeknight regional version of &quot;Capital Tonight&quot; and the nightly sportscast &quot;Sports Night&quot;. The channel&#x27;s headquarters and main studio is located on Atlantic Avenue in Raleigh, just outside downtown. Additional bureaus are located on Morehead Street in downtown Charlotte; at the Centreport office park in Greensboro; on Scientific Park Drive in Wilmington; and in the Croatan National Forest in Newport.

Spectrum News 1 North Carolina maintains five separate feeds for the Charlotte, Research Triangle (Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill), Piedmont Triad (Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point), Wilmington, and Western North Carolina/Mountain areas; each of the feeds primarily carry local news content for their respective region, however some locally produced programs of statewide interest are shared among SN North Carolina&#x27;s feeds.

The channel has four rolling-news blocks: &quot;Your Morning News&quot; from 5am to 10am, &quot;Your Midday News&quot; from 10am to 5pm, &quot;Your Evening News&quot; from 5pm to midnight, and &quot;Your Overnight News&quot; from midnight to 5am.

==History==
Prior to the launch of the channel, then-CBS affiliate WRAL-TV (channel 5; currently an NBC affiliate) of Raleigh, launched the WRAL NewsChannel, a local news channel that was launched in July 2001 on Time Warner Cable&#x27;s digital tier (the channel was also transmitted at the time over WRAL&#x27;s second digital subchannel, now affiliated by Cozi TV).

Time Warner Cable planned to debut its own North Carolina-focused 24-hour local news channel simultaneously in Raleigh, Durham, Fayetteville and Goldsboro in December 2001, which would have given the channel an estimated reach of 425,000 subscribers. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Alan Mason, the channel&#x27;s general manager, said the debut would be delayed until February or March 2002. The reason for the change in launch date was because the channel&#x27;s employees needed training that would have taken place at the new studio facility of sister network NY1 in New York City, however NY1 was concentrating on providing coverage of the attacks and had not yet moved into its new studios. The channel finally made its debut on March 22, 2002, as News 14 Carolina. Reporters used digital cameras instead of videotape, downloading their stories to the newsroom over the computer. Sets, however, more so resembled those used by broadcast television stations.

Time Warner Cable made plans to launch the channel in Charlotte and eight surrounding counties in June. A two-story addition to the Time Warner building on East Morehead Street housed &quot;the nation&#x27;s most technically advanced newsroom,&quot; with digital video that reporters could edit at their desks, and robotic cameras for recording of live and pre-recorded news segments in-studio. In addition, News 14 also operated bureaus in Gastonia and Salisbury. After nine months of preparation, the Charlotte feed of the channel began broadcasting on June 14, under the direction of news director Jim Newman.
Jack Stanley, president of Time Warner&#x27;s Greensboro division, said that if the Charlotte and Raleigh operations performed well, a Greensboro feed of the channel was likely to launch. This was even though ABC affiliate WXLV-TV (channel 45) had recently shut down its news operation, due to low ratings for its newscasts after it failed to compete with the three established stations in that market (WFMY-TV (channel 2), WGHP (channel 8) and WXII-TV (channel 12)).

On February 26, 2004, members of TheWolfWeb exploited the fact that the channel&#x27;s system for reporting school, business or church closures during inclement weather were aired without review. Numerous listings ranging from All Your Base Are Belong To Us to several lewd or obscene &quot;businesses&quot; were listed and shown several times during the channel&#x27;s winter weather coverage. The incident garnered attention from online, print, and broadcast media across the United States, eventually forcing many television stations, including News 14 to establish or increase closing/delay verification and vetting systems to prevent a repeat of the incident.

In June 2004, the website for News 14&#x27;s Charlotte feed won an Edward R. Murrow Award for &quot;best large-market website&quot; among local television stations. In August 2004, Belo Corporation (then-owners of Charlotte NBC affiliate WCNC-TV (channel 36)) ended its newsgathering partnership with News 14; this forced Time Warner Cable to cut costs by moving administrative, production and master control jobs from the Charlotte feed to Raleigh, and closing the Salisbury and Gastonia bureaus, resulting in the loss of about 50 jobs.

In 2005, News 14 Carolina obtained the local cable television rights to broadcast games from the Charlotte Bobcats NBA franchise. News 14&#x27;s Bobcats broadcasts were simulcast on Tri-County 14, the local origination channel of Comporium Communications, the main cable provider for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte market; News 14 lost the Bobcats television rights in 2008. On September 25, 2006, the channel launched a feed for the Piedmont Triad region; this was later followed by the launch of a Wilmington area feed on August 18, 2008.

On February 2, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Sinclair Broadcast Group reached a new carriage contract to resume carriage of WXLV and sister station WMYV (channel 48), resolving a retransmission consent dispute between the two parties. The contract also included a clause to enter into a news share agreement in which News 14 Carolina would begin producing newscasts for WXLV (which had not aired local newscasts since 2004, when it briefly revived its news department as part of Sinclair&#x27;s News Central local/national hybrid operation). The three weekdaily newscasts, originally branded as &quot;News 14 Carolina on ABC 45&quot; (now &quot;Spectrum News on ABC 45&quot;) and airing for a half-hour at 6:30 a.m., 6:00 and 11:00 p.m., debuted on January 2, 2012. The morning and evening newscasts are produced out of the channel&#x27;s Greensboro bureau; the launch of the programs also required expansions to News 14&#x27;s staff.

On December 16, 2013, the channel rebranded as Time Warner Cable News North Carolina as part of a branding standardization across the provider&#x27;s news channels that included the introduction of a new graphics and music package. All of the channel&#x27;s subfeeds around the state were accordingly rebranded as Time Warner Cable News (Raleigh/Charlotte/Triad/Coastal). Prior to the rebrand, the channel was one of only two regional news channels owned by Time Warner Cable (alongside New York City sister network NY1) that did not adopt the &quot;YNN&quot; brand (for &quot;Your News Now&quot;), which was adopted by its other news channels between 2009 and 2011 (including Buffalo, New York sister network Time Warner Cable News Buffalo, which was the first to use the brand when it launched in March 2009 as YNN Buffalo). On May 18, 2016, Time Warner Cable was purchased by Charter Communications; the channel was re-branded Spectrum News North Carolina in March 2017. In May 2017, the channel was added to Charter systems in Lillington (on channel 11) and in Carolina Beach and Topsail/Surf City (on channel 5). In January 2021, Spectrum added a Mountain Region feed based in Asheville directed to Western North Carolina serving the area from Asheville to Boone.

In 2017, the channel received a major on-air design update, flattening the brand, and modernizing the appearance of the channel.

In 2020, the channel was re-branded again to Spectrum News 1 North Carolina.

<doc id="577733" wikidata="Q512792" url="?curid=577733" title="African harrier-hawk">
<text>The African harrier-hawk, harrier hawk or gymnogene (Polyboroides typus) is a bird of prey. It is about in length. It breeds in most of Africa south of the Sahara. The only other member of the genus is the allopatric Madagascar harrier-hawk (&quot;Polyboroides radiatus&quot;).

==Description==

The African harrier-hawk is a medium-sized raptor. The upperparts, head and breast are pale grey. The belly is white with fine dark barring. The broad wings are pale grey with a black trailing edge fringed with a narrow white line. The tail is black with a single broad white band. There is a bare facial patch of variable colour, usually red or yellow. Sexes are similar, but young birds have pale brown instead of grey, and dark brown replacing black. An unusual trait of this species is the double-jointed ankles it possesses, which enable it to reach into otherwise inaccessible holes and cracks for prey. A comparable leg-structure and behaviour can be found in the Neotropical crane hawk as well as the extinct Australian &quot;Pengana&quot;; a case of convergent evolution.

The call is a whistled &quot;&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
African harrier-hawks are a common raptorial species south of the Sahara being most commonly found in the tropical regions of western Africa becoming less common in East and South Africa. African harrier-hawks are adaptable in their habitat preferences, occupying the following habitats in the Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve in the Central African Republic: thick rainforest, forest edge, riparian areas, agricultural land and human occupied areas. African harrier-hawks are adaptable and able to live in both urban and rural human occupied areas and they are one of the most common raptorial species in traditional rural villages of eastern Guinea-Bissau. African harrier-hawks have also been known to breed in Palm trees present in cities and urban gardens.

==Biology==
===Breeding=== 
====Breeding season====
The breeding season starts at different times in different parts of African harrier-hawk distribution. In Nigeria the breeding season is in March-August and South of the equator it appears that the breeding season is in the austral summer but can vary in the months of different countries in South Africa it is November-December but in Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe it is September–November.

====Nests and nesting====
Nest sites are most commonly in large trees that are sometimes growing out of or located on a rocky outcrop. Nests are circular and often placed in the main fork of the tree and are below the canopy. Nests can be used for several breeding seasons and are relatively big as are other raptors&#x27; reaching estimated sizes of 0.75m wide and 0.2m deep. Nests are made of sticks and are lined with leaves from trees neighbouring the nest. The clutch is one to three eggs.

====Courtship====
In the courtship display for African harrier-hawks, either one of or both individuals in a pair soar slowly together, at height, and can often be heard calling during this time. When the male flies on his own he often flies in an undulating pattern and flaps his wings. When the pair fly together, there have been records of the male diving towards the female and touching her back with his talons, and the female turning over and touching talons with the male.

==Foraging==
===Diet===
The African harrier-hawk is omnivorous, eating the fruit of the oil palm as well as hunting small vertebrates. Its ability to climb, using wings as well as feet, and its long double-jointed legs, enable this bird to raid the nests of cavity-nesters such as barbets and woodhoopoes for eggs and nestlings. It has been known to prey on introduced species such as feral pigeons, house sparrows and eastern gray squirrels.

===Foraging techniques===
African harrier-hawks have been identified to employ four different hunting strategies namely: low soaring, high soaring, perch hunting and, canopy and ground foraging. Low soaring is the most commonly used method.The harrier-hawk flies close to the canopy and is often mobbed by small passerine birds. The African harrier-hawk uses the level of aggression shown to help locate nest sites of these passerines and has been observed to turn around when the mobbing by a passerine becomes less aggressive. The harrier-hawk will begin looking for nest sites in the trees once it has found the area where the passerines show the most aggression towards the African harrier-hawk. To catch reptiles in the open African harrier-hawks use high soaring, flying at a maximum of 100m. They descend quickly to a height just above that of the vegetation to where the prey was located. Perch hunting is often used to hunt invertebrates such as orthoptera and other insects. Canopy and ground foraging is where the harrier-hawk either walks on the ground or moves between branches in the canopy looking for prey, looking into crevices and holes in both trees and on the ground.

<text>Mobitex is an OSI based open standard, national public access wireless packet-switched data network. Mobitex puts great emphasis on safety and reliability with its use by military, police, firefighters and ambulance services. It was developed in the beginning of the 1980s by the Swedish Televerket Radio. From 1988, the development took place in Eritel, a joint-venture between Ericsson and Televerket, later on as an Ericsson subsidiary. Mobitex became operational in Sweden in 1986.

In the mid-1990s, Mobitex gained consumer popularity by providing two-way paging network services. It was the first wireless network to provide always on, wireless push email services such as RadioMail and Inter@ctive Paging. It is also used by the first model of Research in Motion&#x27;s BlackBerry, and PDAs such as the Palm VII. During 9/11 and the 2005 hurricane rescue and clean-up operations, Mobitex proved itself to be a very reliable and useful system for first responders.

Mobitex is a packet-switched, narrowband, data-only technology mainly for short burst data. Mobitex channels are 12.5 kHz wide. In North America, Mobitex ran at , while in Europe it uses . The modulation scheme used is GMSK with a slotted aloha protocol at , although user throughput is typically around half of that.

The network provided the first public access wireless data communication services in North America. Subscriber services included electronic messaging with Cc capabilities to multiple recipients, combined with the ability to log on to any wireless or fixed terminal and receive stored mailbox messages.

Mobitex was offered on over 30 networks on five continents. European Mobitex networks almost completely withered in the shadow of the overwhelming success of GSM there in the early 1990s. In Canada, it was first introduced in 1990 by Rogers Cantel, and in 1991 by carrier RAM Mobile Data. In earlier days Mobitex networks in the US were marketed under several names, including RAM Mobile Data, BellSouth Wireless Data, Cingular Wireless and Velocita Wireless following several acquisitions and divestments. Since 2013 the network is operated by American Messaging Services, LLC (AMS) and remains operational.

Mobitex in the UK was marketed by RAM Mobile Data, the UK part of which was purchased from BellSouth (USA) by Twenty First Century Ltd (John Camilleri and Adrian Nicolle) in 2000, that became Transcomm and was then purchased by BT (British Telecom) in 2004. The uses of Mobitex in the United Kingdom were all emergencies (blue light) services, couriers, vehicle telematics (logistics), vending (parking) and vehicle breakdown services (RAC, AA, Green Flag). 

All UK ambulance services used the network to dispatch crews and track progress. The London Metropolitan Police used Mobitex to access the police criminal record database whilst in field and in real time, revolutionary at the time. During the 7/7 terrorist attacks in London, the Transcomm Network was the only wireless network which kept running. Nearly all breakdowns to Green Flag UK service agents were sent using Turbo Dispatch, a Mobitex-based gateway software developed in the early nineties by Ian Lane and Andy Lambert. Despite the competitive nature of the vehicle recovery market in the UK, motoring organisations were persuaded to co-operate and make a standard of the format. This resulted in a major saving for the eight hundred independent garages used by the motoring organisations. The Turbo Dispatch Standards Group (the official keepers of the standard) estimated that at least twenty million breakdowns and recoveries were transmitted over Turbo Dispatch each year. BT subsidiary Transcomm announced the shutdown of the network in 2010.

In Sweden, the Mobitex network was finally shut down permanently on December 31, 2012 after 25 years.

, Mobitex is mainly used in Belgium, the Netherlands (both RAM Mobile Data) (including network coverage of Luxembourg), Hong Kong (Telecom Digital Data Ltd), Canada (Rogers) and the US (AMS).

<doc id="577742" wikidata="Q141130" url="?curid=577742" title="Photograph manipulation">
<text>Photograph manipulation involves the transformation or alteration of a photograph. Some photograph manipulations are considered to be skillful artwork, while others are considered to be unethical practices, especially when used to deceive. Motives for manipulating photographs include political propaganda, altering the appearance of a subject (both for better and for worse), entertainment and humor.

Depending on the application and intent, some photograph manipulations are considered an art form because they involve creation of unique images and in some instances, signature expressions of art by photographic artists. For example, Ansel Adams used darkroom exposure techniques to darken and lighten photographs. Other techniques include retouching using ink or paint, airbrushing, double exposure, piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, and scratching instant films. Software for digital image manipulation ranges from casual to professional skillsets. One of these, Adobe Photoshop, has led to the use of the term photoshop, meaning to digitally edit an image with any program.

== History and techniques ==
Photo manipulation dates back to some of the earliest photographs captured on glass and tin plates during the 19th century. The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce who developed heliography and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate. Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, airbrushing, or scratching Polaroids during developing (Polaroid art). Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the darkroom by piecing photos or negatives together. Some darkroom manipulations involved techniques such as bleaching to artfully lighten or totally wash out parts of the photograph, hand coloring for aesthetic purposes, or mimicking a fine art painting.

In the early 19th century, photography and the technology that made it possible were rather crude and cumbersome. While the equipment and technology progressed over time, it was not until the late 20th century that photography evolved into the digital realm. In the 20th century, digital retouching became available with Quantel computers running Paintbox in professional environments, which, alongside other contemporary packages, were effectively replaced in the market by editing software for graphic imaging, such as Adobe Photoshop and GIMP. At the onset, digital photography was considered by some to be a radical new approach and was initially rejected by photographers because of its substandard quality. The transition from film to digital has been an ongoing process, although much progress was made in the early 21st century as a result of innovation that has greatly improved digital image quality while reducing the bulk and weight of cameras and equipment.

Ansel Adams used darkroom exposure techniques, burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.

Whereas manipulating photographs with tools such as Photoshop and GIMP is generally skill-intensive and time-consuming, the 21st century has seen the arrival of image editing software powered by advanced algorithms which allow complex transformations to be mostly automated. For example, beauty filters which smooth skin tone and create more visually pleasing facial proportions (for example, by enlarging a subject&#x27;s eyes) are available within a number of widely used social media apps such as Instagram and TikTok, and can be applied in real-time to live video. Such features are also available in dedicated image editing mobile applications like Facetune. Some, such as FaceApp use deep-learning algorithms to automate complex, content-aware transformations, such as changing the age or gender of the subject of a photo, or modifying their facial expression.

The term &quot;deepfake&quot; was coined in 2017 to refer to real images and videos generated with deep-learning techniques. The alterations can be created for entertainment purposes, or more nefarious purposes such as spreading disinformation. Fraudulent creations can be used to conduct malicious attacks, political gains, financial crime, or fraud. More recently, deep fakes superimposing the faces of celebrities and other persons onto those of pornographic performers for the purpose of creating pornographic material has become prevalent; deepfake pornography has been criticized due to issues with lack of consent.

Raw astronomical images of celestial objects are usually generated from data provided by complex digital cameras. Raw images include binary (black-and-white) or grayscale data generated in response to infrared or ultraviolet or other energy lying outside the visible light spectrum—requiring people to make technical decisions for how to transform the raw digital data into colorized pictures for human viewing. For example, in images from the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope, the usual transformation is to use blue for the shortest wavelengths, red for the longest wavelengths, and green for intermediate wavelengths. Both scientific accuracy and visual appeal contribute to the decisions, for both enabling accurate analysis by scientists and providing visual interest for the public. Also, science visualization specialists sometimes stack images together, stitch observations from different instruments, enhance contrast, and remove artifacts.

== Political and ethical issues ==
Photo manipulation has been used to deceive or persuade viewers or improve storytelling and self-expression. As early as the American Civil War, photographs were published as engravings based on more than one negative. In 1860, a photograph of the politician John Calhoun was manipulated and his body was used in another photograph with the head of the president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. This photo credits itself as the first manipulated photo.

Joseph Stalin made use of photo retouching for propaganda purposes. On May 5, 1920, his predecessor Vladimir Lenin held a speech for Soviet troops that Leon Trotsky attended. Stalin had Trotsky retouched out of a photograph showing Trotsky in attendance. In a well-known case of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; (&quot;condemnation of memory&quot;) image manipulation, NKVD leader Nikolai Yezhov, after his execution in 1940, was removed from an official press photo where he was pictured with Stalin; historians subsequently nicknaming him the &quot;Vanishing Commissar&quot;. Such censorship of images in the Soviet Union was common.

The pioneer among journalists distorting photographic images for news value was Bernarr Macfadden: in the mid-1920s, his &quot;composograph&quot; process involved reenacting real news events with costumed body doubles and then photographing the dramatized scenes—then pasting faces of the real news-personalities (gathered from unrelated photos) onto his staged images.

A photograph by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s official photographer Heinrich Hoffmann was manipulated to show Hitler celebrating the outbreak of World War I in Munich. In the 1930s, artist John Heartfield used a type of photo manipulation known as the photomontage to critique Nazi propaganda.

Some ethical theories have been applied to image manipulation. During a panel on the topic of ethics in image manipulation Aude Oliva theorized that categorical shifts are necessary in order for an edited image to be viewed as a manipulation. In &quot;Image Act Theory&quot;, Carson Reynolds extended speech act theory by applying it to photo editing and image manipulations. In &quot;How to Do Things with Pictures&quot;, William J. Mitchell details the long history of photo manipulation and discusses it critically.

Photo manipulation is largely considered a useful tool in modern political campaigning and photo manipulations are oftentimes used to amplify political messages and undermine political opponents. For example, on January 6, 2020, US Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) tweeted a photo of US President Barack Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, with the caption &quot;The world is a better place without these guys in power.&quot; It was pointed out that this meeting never took place and in reality was a doctored photo of a meeting between President Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Gosar was criticized for attempting to spread disinformation. The photo had also been previously used in a 2015 advert for Senator Ron Johnson.

In 2023, the organizers of Dublin Pride were accused of &quot;intentionally doctoring photos&quot; to push &quot;propaganda&quot; when they posted an altered image from a 1983 protest, in which the slogan &quot;Trans rights are human rights&quot; was added to a sign carried by a demonstrator. A spokesman for Dublin Pride defended the change, saying that the &quot;practice of altering iconic images for campaigns is a common practice&quot;. The altered image was ultimately removed from the Dublin Pride website.

=== Use in journalism ===
A notable incident of controversial photo manipulation occurred over a photograph that was altered to fit the vertical orientation of a 1982 &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine cover. The altered image made two Egyptian pyramids appear closer together than they actually were in the original photograph. The incident triggered a debate about the appropriateness of falsifying an image, and raised questions regarding the magazine&#x27;s credibility. Shortly after the incident, Tom Kennedy, director of photography for &quot;National Geographic&quot; stated, &quot;We no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect. We regarded that afterward as a mistake, and we wouldn&#x27;t repeat that mistake today.&quot;

There are other incidents of questionable photo manipulation in journalism. One such incident occurred in early 2005 after Martha Stewart was released from prison. &quot;Newsweek&quot; used a photograph of Stewart&#x27;s face on the body of a much slimmer woman for their cover, suggesting that Stewart had lost weight while in prison. Speaking about the incident in an interview, Lynn Staley, assistant managing editor at &quot;Newsweek&quot; said, &quot;The piece that we commissioned was intended to show Martha as she would be, not necessarily as she is.&quot; Staley also explained that &quot;Newsweek&quot; disclosed on page 3 that the cover image of Martha Stewart was a composite.

Image manipulation software has affected the level of trust many viewers once had in the aphorism &quot;the camera never lies&quot;. Images may be manipulated for fun, aesthetic reasons, or to improve the appearance of a subject but not all image manipulation is innocuous, as evidenced by the Kerry Fonda 2004 election photo controversy. The image in question was a fraudulent composite image of John Kerry taken on June 13, 1971, and Jane Fonda taken in August 1972 sharing the same platform at a 1971 antiwar rally, the latter of which carried a fake Associated Press credit with the intent to change the public&#x27;s perspective of reality.

There is a growing body of writings devoted to the ethical use of digital editing in photojournalism. In the United States, for example, the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) established a Code of Ethics which promotes the accuracy of published images, advising that photographers &quot;do not manipulate images [...] that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects.&quot; Infringements of the Code are taken very seriously, especially regarding digital alteration of published photographs, as evidenced by a case in which Pulitzer Prize-nominated photographer Allan Detrich resigned his post following the revelation that a number of his photographs had been manipulated.

In 2010, a Ukrainian photographerStepan Rudik, winner of the 3rd prize story in Sports Featureswas disqualified due to violation of the rules of the World Press Photo contest. &quot;After requesting RAW-files of the series from him, it became clear that an element had been removed from one of the original photographs.&quot; As of 2015, up to 20% of World Press Photo entries that made it to the penultimate round of the contest were disqualified after they were found to have been manipulated or post-processed with rules violations.

== Retouching human subjects ==
A common form of photographic manipulation, particularly in advertising, fashion, boudoir, portrait, and glamour photography, involves edits intended to enhance the appearance of the subject. Common transformations include smoothing skin texture, erasing scars, pimples, and other skin blemishes, slimming the subject&#x27;s body, and erasing wrinkles and folds. Commentators have raised concerns that such practices may lead to unrealistic expectations and negative body image among the audience.

=== Use in fashion ===
The photo manipulation industry has often been accused of promoting or inciting a distorted and unrealistic image of most specifically in younger people. The world of glamour photography is one specific industry that has been heavily involved with the use of photo manipulation (what many consider to be a concerning element as many people look up to celebrities in search of embodying the &#x27;ideal figure&#x27;). Manipulation of a photo to alter a model&#x27;s appearance can be used to change features such as skin complexion, hair color, body shape, and other features. Many of the alterations to skin involve removing blemishes through the use of features included within popular image editing programs which are designed for just such purposes. Photo editors may also alter the color of hair to remove roots or add shine. Additionally, the model&#x27;s teeth and eyes may be made to look whiter than they are in reality. Makeup and piercings can even be edited into pictures to look as though the model was wearing them when the photo was taken. Through photo editing, the appearance of a model may be drastically changed to mask imperfections.

In an article entitled &quot;Confessions of a Retoucher: how the modeling industry is harming women&quot;, a professional retoucher who has worked for mega-fashion brands shares the industry&#x27;s secrets. Along with fixing imperfections like skin wrinkles and smoothing features, the size of the model is manipulated by either adding or subtracting visible weight. Reverse retouching is just as common as making models skinnier, &quot;distorting the bodies of very thin models to make them appear more robust in a process called reverse retouching. It is almost worse than making someone slimmer because the image claims you can be at an unhealthy weight but still look healthy. In reality, you can&#x27;t, you have to Photoshop it&quot;. Reverse retouching includes eliminating shadows from protruding bones, adding flesh over body parts, color correcting, and removing hair generated for warmth from extreme weight loss. Professionals are saying that if an image is not labeled &quot;not retouched&quot;, then the public can assume that photograph has been modified. As the fashion industry continues to use photos that have been manipulated to idealize body types, there is a need for education about how unreal and unhealthy these images are and the negative implications they are promoting.

A digital manipulation expert, who edited and altered a lot of images for the fashion industry and wants to remain private, says it is normal to digitally manipulate a photograph of a model to make them appear thinner, regardless of actual weight. Generally, photographs are edited to remove the appearance of up to . However, in the past 20 years, the practice has changed, as more celebrities are on social media and the public is now more aware of their actual appearances; it is likely that significant alterations would be noticed. The retoucher notes that the industry&#x27;s goal is to make significant income in advertising and that the unrealistic ideals cycle will continue as they have to maintain this.

Starting in 2012, &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine said they intended to no longer manipulate photos of their models. The decision was made after a 14-year-old girl, Julia Bluhm, petitioned that the magazine use a minimum of one unaltered photo in each of their spread per issue. The petition received over 84,000 signatures.

=== On social media ===
Social media apps such as Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok enable users to manipulate photos using the back or front camera, applying pre-made filters to enhance the quality of the picture, distort themselves, or add creative elements such as text, coloring or stickers. Filters provided on social media platforms are made by social media companies or are user-generated content. Photo editing techniques include the addition of polls, GIFs, music, countdowns, donations, and links. Influencers use filters to grow engagement and boost follower activity, in order to be seen as unique, creative, or fascinating. Meta reported that over 600 million people have used an AR effect on Facebook or Instagram.

Mobile phone applications such as Facetune allow users to modify their own personal images. Social media users, especially younger people, are thus exposed to an extreme amount of manipulated imagery presenting unrealistic, unachievable body ideals. For example, social media platforms such as TikTok have include filters that create an illusion of physical attributes, such as the &quot;skinny filter&quot; and the &quot;perfect skin filter&quot;. Part of the idea of perfection on social media comes from Japanese culture and the word &quot;kawaii&quot;, which translates to an overall aspect of cuteness; exerting fragile, girly, and childlike emotions. Kawaii-enhanced photos present a perception of perfection in a photo booth setting. This notion catalyzed the first selfie phone camera by Kyocera in 1999, which led to the posting of selfies during the beginnings of MySpace in the early 2000s.

=== In advertising ===
Photo manipulation has been used in advertisements for television commercials and magazines to make their products or the person look better and more appealing than how they look in reality. Some tricks that are used with photo manipulation for advertising are: fake grill marks with eye-liner, using white glue instead of milk, or using deodorant to make vegetables look glossy.

=== Celebrity opposition ===
Photo manipulation has triggered negative responses from both viewers and celebrities. This has led to celebrities refusing to have their photos retouched in support of the American Medical Association that has decided that &quot;[we] must stop exposing impressionable children and teenagers to advertisements portraying models with body types only attainable with the help of photo editing software&quot;. These include Keira Knightley, Brad Pitt, Andy Roddick, Jessica Simpson, Lady Gaga, and Zendaya.

Brad Pitt had a photographer, Chuck Close, take photos of him that emphasized his flaws. Chuck Close is known for his photos that emphasize the skin flaws of an individual. Pitt did so in an effort to speak out against media using image manipulation software and manipulating celebrities&#x27; photos in an attempt to hide their flaws. Kate Winslet spoke out against photo manipulation in media after &quot;GQ&quot; magazine altered her body, making it look unnaturally thin. 42-year-old Cate Blanchett appeared on the cover of &quot;Intelligent Life&quot;&#x27;s 2012 March/April issue, makeup-free and without digital retouching for the first time.

In April 2010, Britney Spears agreed to release &quot;un-airbrushed images of herself next to the digitally altered ones&quot;. The fundamental motive behind her move was to &quot;highlight the pressure exerted on women to look perfect&quot;. In 2014, Hungarian pop vocalist and songwriter Boggie produced two music videos that achieved global attention for its stance on whitewashing in the beauty industry: the #1 MAHASZ chart hit &quot;Parfüm&quot; (Hungarian version) and &quot;Nouveau Parfum&quot; (French version) from her self-titled album &quot;Boggie&quot;, which reached two &quot;Billboard&quot; charts (#3 Jazz Album, #17 World Music Album). In the videos, the artist is shown singing as she is extensively retouched in real-time, ending with a side-by-side comparison of her natural and manipulated images as the song fades out.

=== Corporate opposition ===
Some companies have begun to speak out against photo manipulation in advertising their products. Dove created the Dove Self-Esteem Fund and the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty to build confidence in young women, emphasizing &quot;real beauty&quot;, or unretouched photographs, in the media. Clothing retailer Aerie&#x27;s campaign #AerieREAL emphasizes that their clothes are for everyone and that their advertisements have not been retouched in any way, saying &quot;The real you is sexy.&quot;

The American Medical Association stated that it is opposed to the use of photo manipulation. Dr. McAneny made a statement that altering models to such extremes creates unrealistic expectations in children and teenagers regarding body image. He also said that the practice of digitally altering the weight of models in photographs should be stopped, so that children and teenagers are not exposed to body types that cannot be attained in reality. The American Medical Association as a whole adopted a policy to work with advertisers to work on setting up guidelines for advertisements to try to limit how much digital image manipulation is used. The goal of this policy is to limit the number of unrealistic expectations for body image in advertisements.

=== Government opposition ===
Governments are exerting pressure on advertisers, and are starting to ban photos that are too airbrushed and edited. In the United Kingdom, the Advertising Standards Authority has banned an advertisement by Lancôme featuring Julia Roberts for being misleading, stating that the flawless skin seen in the photo was too good to be true. The US is also moving in the direction of banning excessive photo manipulation where a CoverGirl model&#x27;s ad was banned because it had exaggerated effects, leading to a misleading representation of the product.

In 2015, France proceeded to pass a law that battles against the use of unrealistic body images and anorexia in the fashion industry. This includes modeling and photography. The models now have to show they are healthy and have a BMI of over 18 through a note from their doctor. Employers breaking this law will be fined and can serve a jail sentence of up to six months. When a creator of a photograph does not disclose that the picture is edited or retouched, no matter how small the edit, they may also receive a fine or 30% of the costs of what they used to create their ad.

In 2021, Norway enacted legislation making it a requirement to label digital manipulations of the bodies of persons when depicted in advertising. Failure to do so is punishable by a fine.

=== Support ===
Some editors of magazine companies do not view manipulating their cover models as an issue. In an interview with the editor of the French magazine &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, she stated that their readers are not idiots and that they can tell when a model has been retouched. Also, some who support photo manipulation in the media state that the altered photographs are not the issue, but that it is the expectations that viewers have that they fail to meet, such as wanting to have the same body as a celebrity on the cover of their favorite magazine.

=== Opinion polling ===
A survey done by the United Kingdom-based fashion store New Look showed that 90% of the individuals surveyed would prefer seeing a wider variety of body shapes in media. This would involve them wanting to see cover models that are not all thin, but some with more curves than others. The survey also talked about how readers view the use of photo manipulation. One statistic stated that 15% of the readers believed that the cover images are accurate depictions of the model in reality. Also, they found that 33% of women who were surveyed are aiming for a body that is impossible for them to attain.

Dove and People Weekly also did a survey to see how photo manipulation affects the self-esteem of females. In doing this, they found that 80% of the women surveyed felt insecure when seeing photos of celebrities in the media. Of the women surveyed who had lower self-esteem, 70% of them do not believe that their appearance is pretty or stylish enough in comparison to cover models.

=== Social and cultural implications ===
The growing popularity of image manipulation has raised concern as to whether it allows for unrealistic images to be portrayed to the public. In her article &quot;On Photography&quot; (1977), Susan Sontag discusses the objectivity, or lack thereof, in photography, concluding that &quot;photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored and tricked out&quot;. A practice widely used in the magazine industry, the use of photo manipulation on an already subjective photograph creates a constructed reality for the individual and it can become difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. With the potential to alter body image, debate continues as to whether manipulated images, particularly those in magazines, contribute to self-esteem issues in both men and women.

In today&#x27;s world, photo manipulation has a positive impact by developing the creativity of one&#x27;s mind or maybe a negative one by removing the art and beauty of capturing something so magnificent and natural or the way it should be. According to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;Photoshopping and airbrushing, many believe, are now an inherent part of the beauty industry, as are makeup, lighting and styling&quot;. In a way, these image alterations are &quot;selling&quot; actual people to the masses to affect responses, reactions, and emotions toward these cultural icons.

== &quot;Photoshop&quot; as a verb ==
The terms &quot;Photoshop&quot;, &quot;photoshopped&quot; and &quot;photoshopping&quot;, derived from Adobe Photoshop, are ubiquitous and widely used colloquially and academically when referencing image editing software as it relates to digital manipulation and alteration of photographs. The term commonly refers to digital editing of photographs regardless of which software program is used.

Trademark owner Adobe Inc. object to what they refer to as misuse of their trademarked software name, and consider it an infringement on their trademark to use terms such as &quot;photoshopped&quot; or &quot;photoshopping&quot; as a noun or verb, in possessive form or as a slang term, to prevent &quot;genericization&quot; or &quot;genericide&quot; of the company&#x27;s trademark. Separately, the Free Software Foundation advises against using &quot;photoshop&quot; as a verb because Adobe Photoshop is proprietary software.

In popular culture, the term &quot;photoshopping&quot; is sometimes associated with montages in the form of visual jokes, such as those published on Fark and in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine. Images may be propagated memetically via e-mail as humor or passed as actual news in a form of hoax. An example of the latter category is &quot;Helicopter Shark&quot;, which was widely circulated as a so-called &quot;&quot;National Geographic&quot; Photo of the Year&quot; and was later revealed to be a hoax. Photoshop contests are games organized online with the goal of creating humorous images around a theme.

On June 1, 1929, the city of Saskatoon was given a &quot;Licence For Air Harbour&quot; and the airport was established. This provided a home for the Saskatoon Aero Club.

From 1940 to 1947, the city leased the airport to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). The airport became RCAF Station Saskatoon. The station was a part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, and the station was home to No. 4 Service Flight Training School. To support these operations four large hangars were built as well as support buildings including a hospital and control tower.

After the war (1947) the airport was transferred to the Canadian Department of Transport for civilian use. That year Trans-Canada Air Lines, now known as Air Canada, started providing passenger service using DC-3 aircraft. 

Air Canada in 1950 began operating the Canadair North Star at the airport, followed by the Vickers Viscount in 1955. A new terminal building was also constructed in 1955 by Transport Department architects.

The primary runway (09/27) was lengthened in 1954 and again in 1960 to . The secondary runway (15/33) was lengthened in 1963 to . 

From 1950 to 1978 the Airport was again made a station of the RCAF. The station was named RCAF Station Saskatoon.

On January 1, 1971, the City of Saskatoon annexed the airport and surrounding lands totalling 2,111.7 acres. The nearby area containing personnel housing and support services was annexed by the city in 1965.

Due to larger aircraft and more frequent flights, in 1972 plans were drafted for a new terminal building. The new terminal built by Holiday and Scott was completed and opened on November 29, 1975. The former terminal was renovated in 1977. From 1977 to 1984 Boeing 747 charter flights were operated by Wardair to Europe until Wardair was bought by Canadian Airlines International.

In 1993 the name of the airport was changed to recognize Canada&#x27;s 13th Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. In 1995 under the Canada-US Open Skies agreement Northwest Airlines started service to Minneapolis – Saint Paul. In 1996 WestJet began Boeing 737 service. In 1999 the airport was turned over to the Saskatoon Airport Authority (now known as Skyxe), as part of the National Airports Policy.

In 2000, Nav Canada constructed a new control tower and the airport authority began renovations and expansions to the terminal building. In October 2002 the first two phases of renovations to the air terminal building were completed at a cost of $18 million. The updated terminal facilities are designed to handle 1.4 million passengers annually was designed by Kindrachuk Agrey Architects. In 2005 additional renovations were completed to the check-in area and baggage screening as well as the addition of a fifth bridge. In 2006 the airport also expanded public parking to 500 stalls. In March 2008 work started on the rehabilitation of runway 09/27, taxiway Foxtrot and Alpha at a cost of $16 million.

Between October 2005 and May 2008, Air Canada ended &quot;mainline&quot; service into Saskatoon, turning over routes to Air Canada Jazz. In 2006, Pronto Airways started operating at the airport. In 2006 Transwest Air introduced service to Fort McMurray, Alberta. For a short period of time between 2006 and April 2007 Northwestern Air also operated flights to Fort McMurray. In 2008, United Airlines began non-stop regional service from Denver that operated until 2015. In 2009, United Airlines announced regional service from Chicago that operated until 2014.

In March 2015, Missinippi Airways began thrice-weekly service to Saskatoon direct to Flin Flon, Manitoba, with a one-stop connection to The Pas, Manitoba. Missinippi Airways ceased flying out of Saskatoon three months later. In June, 2016, New Leaf Airlines announced they would begin flying to Kelowna and Hamilton direct from Saskatoon twice weekly beginning July 27, 2016. New Leaf cancelled service to Saskatoon in November 2016.

== Expansion 2010s ==
In 2009, Skyxe announced a new expansion for the terminal. The plan included nine bridgeable gates and a food court, including a full-service restaurant and bar (post-security). Also included in the plan was more retail, including a duty-free outlet, and another food court before the security area. The new design moved security for more room for retail, but also planned to double the size of the security area. The check-in area was not included in the expansion. A new Canadian Customs and Immigration area was put in, as well as two more baggage carousels. The designers also left space that was meant for an American Pre-Customs and Immigration area, so in the future YXE can be upgraded to have U.S. Pre-Clearance area.

In 2010 construction started on apron improvements, remote stands and preparatory work to start on reconstruction of the terminal building in 2011. The expansion was designed to accommodate eight bridges, expanded passenger waiting areas, a business/first class lounge and expanded baggage claim area. Phase 1 of Saskatoon International Airport expansion began in 2012. The expansion virtually doubled the size of the air terminal building to . In 2013, Skyxe completed its phase 1 terminal expansion. In October, the airport welcomed its first arriving and departing passengers into the expanded terminal. In April 2015, construction of the terminal was completed at overall cost of the project was $53 million.

In February 2016, Skyxe issued request for proposals for Air Terminal Building Groundside Departures Hall Expansion, West Aero Park Development, and Saskatoon International Airport rebranding. Skyxe issued additional request for proposals for Shuttle Parking Lot Development and Apron III and V Pavement Rehabilitation.

== Passenger services ==
The airport contains a small historical display on the main floor. There are also numerous art/photography displays by local artists around the terminal. There are a full restaurant, a Tim Hortons and a Starbucks in the post-security area, and a Relay store near the entrances.

In February 2015, St. John&#x27;s Ambulance introduced therapy dogs to the airport, providing a service to put nervous passengers at ease.

== Ground transportation ==
Saskatoon Transit (Route 11) provides city bus service between the airport and the downtown core.

Taxis and several car rental agencies are available from the airport.

== Other air side services ==
The airport has a variety of additional buildings. These include the International Aviation Terminal (used by Air Canada Cargo, Anderson Aviation, Dryden Air-services). Twenty-three former Air Canada Jazz and Canadian Regional Airlines Fokker F28 aircraft have been stored at the airport since they were retired from the fleet in 2003.

The Saskatchewan Air Ambulance provides fixed wing air ambulance services, and has its headquarters and main base at the airport. There is a hangar for a Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society helicopter out of the Saskatoon airport.

<text>Gale Sondergaard (born Edith Holm Sondergaard; February 15, 1899 – August 14, 1985) was an American actress.

Sondergaard began her acting career in theater and progressed to films in 1936. She was the first recipient of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her film debut in &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936). She regularly had supporting roles in films during the late 1930s and 1940s, including &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1939), &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940). For her role in &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (1946), she was nominated for her second Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. After 1949, her screen work came to an abrupt end for 20 years, primarily due to the Hollywood blacklist.

Married to director Herbert Biberman, Sondergaard supported him when he was accused of communism and imprisoned as one of the Hollywood Ten in the early 1950s. She moved with Biberman to New York City and worked in theater. She only returned to occasional acting in film and television beginning in 1969, when she moved back to Los Angeles. She died from cerebrovascular thrombosis in 1985.

==Early life==
Sondergaard was born in Litchfield, Minnesota, to Danish immigrants, Hans Sondergaard (born Hans Tjellesen Schmidt Søndergaard) and Anna Kirstine Søndergaard (née Holm). Her father taught at the University of Minnesota, where she was a drama student.

==Stage and film career==
===Until the late 1940s===
Sondergaard studied acting at the Minneapolis School of Dramatic Arts before joining the John Keller Shakespeare Company. She later toured North America in productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;. After joining the Theatre Guild, she began performing on the New York stage.
She made her first film appearance in &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936) as Faith Paleologus, for which she received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her career flourished during the 1930s, notably as the steadfastly loyal wife of disgraced innocent Alfred Dreyfus in &quot;The Life of Emile Zola starring Paul Muni&quot; (1937).
During pre-production of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s classic &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), an early idea was to have the Wicked Witch of the West portrayed as a slinky, glamorous villainess in a black, sequined costume, inspired by the Evil Queen in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937). Sondergaard was cast as the witch and photographed for two wardrobe tests, both of which survive—one as a glamorous witch, and another as a conventionally ugly one. After the decision was made to have an ugly witch, Sondergaard, reluctant to wear the disfiguring makeup and fearing it could damage her career, withdrew from the role, and it went to veteran character actress Margaret Hamilton. 

Sondergaard was cast as the sultry and slinky Tylette, a magically humanized but devious cat, in &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; (1940), and played the exotic, sinister Eurasian wife in &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940) starring Bette Davis. She had a supporting role in &quot;The Spider Woman&quot; (aka &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Spider Woman&quot;, 1943), part of the Universal cycle, followed by the non-canonical &quot;The Spider Woman Strikes Back&quot; (1946), also for Universal.

She received a second Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her role as the king&#x27;s principal wife in &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (1946).

===House Un-American Activities Committee===
Sondergaard&#x27;s career suffered irreparable damage during the United States Congressional HUAC Red Scare of the early 1950s when her husband was accused of being a communist and named as one of the Hollywood Ten. With her career stalled, she supported her husband during the production of &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; (1954). They sold their home in Hollywood shortly after they completed &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; and moved to New York where Sondergaard was able to work in theater.

===Later career===
In 1969, she appeared in an off-Broadway one-woman show, &quot;Woman&quot;. She resumed her career in film and television around the same time. Her revived career extended into the early 1980s.

==Personal life==
Her younger sister Hester Sondergaard was also an actress who featured in &quot;Seeds of Freedom&quot; (1943), &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1948), &quot;Jigsaw&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Big Break&quot; (1953).

Sondergaard married actor Neill O&#x27;Malley in 1922; they divorced in 1930. On May 15, 1930, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she married director Herbert Biberman, who was then associated with the Theatre Guild Acting Company. He became a film director and died in 1971. They adopted two children, Joan Kirstine Biberman (married name Campos, 1940) and Daniel Hans Biberman.

Following several strokes, Sondergaard died from cerebral vascular thrombosis in the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California in 1985, aged 86. She had been admitted to the hospital in 1982.

<text>Mamayev Kurgan () is a dominant height overlooking the city of Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) in Southern Russia. The name in Russian means &quot;tumulus of Mamai&quot;. 
The formation is dominated by a memorial complex commemorating the Battle of Stalingrad (August 1942 to February 1943). The battle, a hard-fought Soviet victory over Axis forces on the Eastern Front of World War II, turned into one of the bloodiest battles in human history. At the time of its installation in 1967 the statue, named &quot;The Motherland Calls&quot;, formed the largest free-standing sculpture in the world.

== Battle ==
When forces of the German Sixth Army launched their attack against the city centre of Stalingrad on 13 September 1942, Mamayev Kurgan (appearing in military maps as &quot;Height 102.0&quot;) saw particularly fierce fighting between the German attackers and the defending soldiers of the Soviet 62nd Army. Control of the hill became vitally important, as it offered control over the city. To defend it, the Soviets had built strong defensive lines on the slopes of the hill, composed of trenches, barbed-wire and minefields. The Germans pushed forward against the hill, taking heavy casualties. When they finally captured the hill, they started firing on the city centre, as well as on the city&#x27;s main railway station under the hill. They captured the Volgograd railway station on 14 September 1942.

On the same day, the Soviet 13th Guards Rifle Division commanded by Alexander Rodimtsev arrived in the city from the east side of the river Volga under heavy German artillery fire. The division&#x27;s 10,000 men immediately rushed into the battle. On 16 September they recaptured Mamayev Kurgan and kept fighting for the railway station, taking heavy losses. By the following day, almost all of them had died. The Soviets kept reinforcing their units in the city as fast as they could. The Germans assaulted up to twelve times a day, and the Soviets would respond with fierce counter-attacks.

The hill changed hands several times. By September 27, the Germans again captured half of Mamayev Kurgan. The Soviets held their own positions on the slopes of the hill, as the 284th Rifle Division defended the key stronghold. The defenders held out until January 26 1943, when the counterattacking Soviet forces relieved them. The battle of the city ended one week later with an utter German defeat.

When the battle ended, the soil on the hill had been so thoroughly churned by shellfire and mixed with metal fragments that it contained between 500 and 1,250 splinters of metal per square meter. The earth on the hill had remained black in the winter, as the snow kept melting in the many fires and explosions. In the following spring the hill would still remain black, as no grass grew on its scorched soil. The hill&#x27;s formerly steep slopes had become flattened in months of intense shelling and bombardment. Even today, it is possible to find fragments of bone and metal still buried deep throughout the hill.

== Memorial Complex ==

After the war, the Soviet authorities commissioned the enormous Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex. Vasily Chuikov, who led Soviet forces at Stalingrad, lies buried at Mamayev Kurgan; this makes him the only Marshal of the Soviet Union to be buried outside Moscow. 34,505 soldiers who were defenders of Stalingrad are buried there; sniper Vasily Zaytsev was also reburied there, in 2006.

=== Avenue of Poplars; &quot;Stand To the Death!&quot; ===
Mamayev Kurgan is accessible by a flight of stairs leading to the Avenue of Poplars, flanked on either side by poplar trees. From there, a second flight of steps leads to the statue of a muscular and shirtless Russian soldier. This statue, named &quot;Stand To the Death!&quot;, is carved from rock and surrounded by a large pool of water; it bears the inscription ...And not a step back!

=== Symbolic Ruined Walls; Square of Heroes ===
From &quot;Stand To the Death!&quot;, a third flight of stairs leads between the &quot;Symbolic Ruined Walls&quot;; these represent the ruins of Stalingrad, while immortalizing the Soviet heroes who defended the city. Carved into the walls are faces of numerous soldiers, their eyes closed to indicate death in battle. Also inscribed on the walls are numerous quotes from actual defenders of Stalingrad; these words were originally carved, by the soldiers themselves, upon the sides of various ruined buildings throughout the city.

Atop the steps, past the walls, is the &quot;Square of Heroes&quot;; this is dominated by another large pool of water. On one side of the pool is a wall bearing this inscription: With an iron wind blowing straight into their faces, they were still marching forward; and fear seized the enemy. &quot;Were these people who were attacking? Were they even mortal at all&quot;? On the other side of the pool are six sculptures, the first of which bears the inscription: &quot;We&#x27;ve stood out and defeated death.&quot; The second and third sculptures commemorate military nurses and, respectively, sea soldiers. The fourth sculpture is dedicated to the officers who led the battle to protect Stalingrad. The fifth sculpture tells the story of &quot;Saving the Banner&quot;. The sixth sculpture commemorates the eventual triumph of the Russian army over the Germans.

=== Hall of Military Glory ===
Past the Square of Heroes is the &quot;Hall of Military Glory&quot;, whose outer façade is decorated with Russian artwork of Soviet soldiers celebrating the war&#x27;s end...and with the inscription &quot;Our people will keep alive their memory of the greatest battle in the history of warfare, within the walls of Stalingrad.&quot; 

An indoor flight of stairs leads to the Hall&#x27;s circular main chamber; at the chamber&#x27;s center is the &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, a large sculpture of a hand holding a torch. The Eternal Flame is constantly under armed guard, which is changed every hour. The main chamber is considered sacred ground, with mournful music being played on a loop; out of respect, visitors are strongly discouraged from speaking aloud. The chamber&#x27;s walls are covered in glass-foil mosaics; these bear the names of 7,200 Russian soldiers who died in the battle for Stalingrad. Around the ceiling of the chamber is the following inscription: &quot;...Yes, we were mere mortals, and few of us survived (the German siege). But we all fulfilled our patriotic duty to our sacred Motherland.&quot;

=== &quot;Mother&#x27;s Sorrow&quot; ===
The hall&#x27;s upper exit leads to the base of a pathway, which in turn zigzags uphill to the &quot;Mother Russia Is Calling!&quot; statue itself. Also at the hill&#x27;s base is a third shallow pool, this one surrounding a stone monument named &quot;Mother&#x27;s Sorrow&quot;.
The hill itself is an unmarked grave for over 34,500 Russian troops killed at Stalingrad; even this is a tiny percentage of the overall Soviet casualties from the battle. The grass on the hill is considered sacred, and visitors are forbidden to step on it. The top of the hill gives a panoramic view of the city of Volgograd. 

Mamayev Kurgan is open to the public 24 hours a day, and there is no charge for admission.

== Background ==
The monumental memorial was constructed between 1959 and 1967, and is crowned by a huge allegorical statue of the Motherland on the top of the hill. The monument, designed by Yevgeny Vuchetich, has the full name &quot;The Motherland Calls!&quot; ( &quot;Rodina Mat Zovyot!&quot;). It consists of a concrete sculpture, 52 meters tall, and 85 meters from the feet to the tip of the 27-meters sword, dominating the skyline of the city of Stalingrad (later renamed Volgograd).

The construction uses concrete, except for the stainless-steel blade of the sword, and is held on its plinth solely by its own weight. The statue is evocative of classical Greek representations of Nike, in particular the flowing drapery, similar to that of the Nike of Samothrace.

<text>Olecko (former since 1560, colloquially also , since 1928) is a town in northeastern Poland. It is in Masuria, near Ełk and Suwałki, in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. It is at the mouth of the Lega river which flows into the Great Olecko Lake (&quot;Jezioro Oleckie Wielkie&quot;) on its southwestern shore. Olecko is the seat of Olecko County.

==History==

Since the 1540s, there was a hunting lodge on the Lega River, soon expanded into a castle, and a settlement, both called &quot;Olecko&quot;. &quot;Margrabowa&quot; was founded as a town by Albert, Duke of Prussia, a vassal of Poland, on January 1, 1560. The name was derived from the word &quot;Margrabia&quot; (Polish for Margrave), the duke&#x27;s title as the margraviate of Brandenburg-Ansbach&#x27;s prince, by adding the suffix &quot;-owa&quot;, which is typical in Poland for place names derived from personal names and titles. The town&#x27;s coat of arms still reflects the Brandenburg red eagle and the Hohenzollern black and white which go back to Duke Albert. The town&#x27;s first wójt was Adam Wojdowski. Wojdowski brought Poles from Mazovia and Masuria to settle the town. Already in 1560, the new residents appointed a town council and municipal court and selected fellow Pole Stanisław Milewski as the first mayor. As of 1600, the population was exclusively Polish. The Poles referred to the town by its older Polish name &quot;Olecko&quot;. In 1616, the seat of the local starosts was definitively moved from Straduny to Olecko.

The town remained under Polish suzerainty until 1657 when the Duchy of Prussia became independent. In 1701 it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and in 1871 part of German Empire. 922 people died during the Great Northern War plague outbreak in 1710. In June 1807, Polish soldiers of General Józef Zajączek took Olecko, then left the town to be replaced by the 2nd Infantry Regiment of Jan Henryk Dąbrowski. Dąbrowski himself visited the town several times. It was believed that both the town and the Masuria region would eventually be part of the restored Polish state after the defeat of Prussia. In June 1812, the IV Cavalry Corps of the French Army with the Polish 4th Light Cavalry Division marched through the town towards Moscow. Between 1818 and 1945, Marggrabowa became the seat of &quot;Oletzko County&quot; (German: &quot;Kreis Oletzko&quot;) in the province of East Prussia.
From the beginning of the 19th century, the Prussian authorities launched attempts to Germanize the population, as Poles made up 90% of the county&#x27;s population as of 1818. Germanization at first was pursued because of a fear of Polonization in Masuria since the German languages&#x27; status was fragile in the region, but in the aftermath of November Uprising the Prussian government took a more hardline approach, proclaiming that all pupils must learn German in school. In 1836, the local priesthood organized a synod in the town which protested against Germanization policies. The synod&#x27;s protest was signed by all the pastors in the county, and its arguments were later used by the well-known defenders of the Polish language in Masuria, Gustaw Gizewiusz and Krzysztof Celestyn Mrongovius. The protests were successful, however, the campaign of Germanization was resumed in 1865 and later intensified. As a result, during the second half of the 19th century the proportion of German speakers increased.

In 1920, after Poland regained independent existence following World War I, a plebiscite was to be held in the area by the League of Nations, according to the Treaty of Versailles, to determine the future of the region and the town. In Oletzko, a German mob dispersed a Polish public meeting at the market square and beat up gathered Polish activists. On the day of the plebiscite, July 11, 1920, a crowd of Germans chanting anti-Polish slogans marched to cast their votes. In turn, many Polish supporters boycotted the plebiscite, considering it a farce, and also because they feared German threats of revenge. The plebiscite in the town resulted in 3,903 votes for Germany and none for Poland. As a result, the town was renamed Treuburg (lit.: &quot;loyal castle&quot;) in 1928.

During World War II, many Poles, but also some Belarusians, Ukrainians and Russians, were enslaved by the Germans as forced labour in the town&#x27;s vicinity. In the final stages of the war, the Germans forcibly evacuated the town&#x27;s residents. The abandoned town was captured by the Red Army on January 23, 1945, and afterwards it became again part of Poland under territorial changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945. The town was repopulated by Polish settlers, both from nearby Suwałki and Podlachia regions, and from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

In 1949, a dairy and egg cooperative was launched in Olecko, and in 1950, it also began producing cheese.

==Sights==

&quot;Plac Wolności&quot; (Freedom Square) is one of the largest market squares in Poland. The Our Lady Queen of Poland church is situated on a tree-covered hill in its northern part. Another notable sight is the Oleckie Wielkie Lake with a promenade, a municipal beach and preserved historic pier.

==Transport==
The Olecko train station in the western part of town is a regional railway junction: there were main lines to Gołdap, Ełk and Suwałki. The local railway connections to Mieruniszki, Kruklanki and Sulejki are out of service or dismantled. Currently, only bus service runs from the train station.

==Culture==
The main cultural institution of Olecko is the &quot;Mazury Garbate&quot; Regional Cultural Center with its cinema, theater, etc. &quot;Miejsko-Powiatowa Biblioteka Publiczna&quot; is the main public library of the town.

Olecko hosts the annual festivals Przystanek Olecko, which includes mostly rock acts, and Mazurskie Spotkania z Folklorem (&quot;Masurian Meetings with Folklore&quot;), dedicated to folk music with performers from Poland and various other countries.

The Olecko Milk and Honey Festival, an annual fair dedicated to milk and honey products, is held in August, in reference to local traditions of milk, dairy and honey production. The honey of Olecko land, which comes in several varieties, i.e. multi-flower honey, linden honey, rapeseed honey, forest honey, buckwheat honey, and honeydew honey, is an officially protected traditional food of the Olecko County, as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland.

==Sports==
The town&#x27;s leading sport club is with football, handball, table tennis and chess sections. Other clubs include athletics club Korab Olecko, shooting club Wilk Olecko and women&#x27;s volleyball club Perła Olecka.

<text>The British Rail Class 07 diesel locomotive is an off-centre cab 0-6-0 diesel-electric shunter type built by Ruston &amp; Hornsby in 1962 for the Southern Region of British Railways. The 14 members of the class were primarily used at Southampton Docks and later also at Eastleigh Works.

==Background==

The 07 class was originally designed to replace steam power on the Southampton Docks network, which at its peak consisted of some 80 miles of track and immediately prior to the introduction of diesel power was operated by six ex-LBSCR 0-6-0 class E2 and fourteen ex-Southern Railway USA class 0-6-0 tank locomotives.

The specifications for the class arose from a report produced by the General Managers of British Transport Docks and the Southern Region of British Railways, in which the relative merits of the 204 hp Class 04 and 350 hp Class 12 0-6-0 diesel shunters were discussed. Due to the need to traverse small radius curves on the docks network, it was concluded that a compromise between the shorter wheelbase of the former and greater power output of the latter was desirable, thus giving rise to the requirement for a locomotive with a fixed wheelbase not exceeding 10 ft and maximum power output of around 275 hp to 300 hp (with a weight not exceeding 10 tons).

==Operation==
The class was notorious for having the axleboxes run hot when travelling at high speed. This was initially encountered during delivery of the first locomotive, and subsequent deliveries were made by road. A later trial move of one Class 07 to Selhurst Depot for tyre profiling also resulted in overheating axlebox problems and all subsequent moves of any distance, particularly those to British Rail Engineering Limited workshops, were made by road. This is in contrast to other shunter classes that would commonly have had their coupling rods removed and traction motors isolated and would then form part of a train heading in the appropriate direction. Class 08s were commonly moved in this fashion at up to – overnight wagon-load trains being utilised if possible.

For operation at Southampton Docks, the class was based in the former steam shed in the Old Docks near the River Itchen, work being carried out there by a fitter sent from Eastleigh.

The members of the class that had TOPS numbering applied were also equipped with high-level air brake pipes, allowing them to move Southern Region electric multiple units, and three locomotives were used at Bournemouth EMU Depot for a period. This was not their principal work, but they were often employed around their home depot on general shunting duties. They were relatively fast for shunters and it was envisaged that they would be used to trip local traffic to/from Southampton docks. Accordingly, they were equipped, from new, with mainline headcode marker lights (six for the SR). In practice they were seldom used for this because of the hot axlebox problem, which also affected the possibility of the class working away from either Southampton Docks or Eastleigh Works.

==Withdrawal==
Numbers 2988, 2992 and 2998 were withdrawn from BR service without bearing TOPS numbers, and were cut up at Eastleigh Works; 2988 in 1973, 2992 and 2998 in 1976. 2991, which was allocated the number 07007, was also withdrawn from capital stock before bearing its TOPS number, but remained in use at Eastleigh Works. Of the locos to bear TOPS numbers, 07003 and 07009 were withdrawn in 1976, and sold to P Wood of Queenborough, Kent; 07009 was exported to Italy, and 07003 was sold to British Industrial Sand at Oakamoor, Staffordshire, being subsequently scrapped in 1985. 07010 was sold directly into preservation, and the remaining locos were sold for industrial use during 1976 and 1977: 07001 to Staveley Limeworks, Buxton; 07002/6/12 to Powell Duffryn, Kidwelly (where 07002 and 07006 were scrapped in the 1980s); 07013 to Dow Chemical Company, King&#x27;s Lynn.
==Post-BR use and preservation==


The locomotives were short-lived and this class had been withdrawn by British Rail by the end of 1977. Several were bought for industrial use and have subsequently passed into preservation. Two locomotives, no. 07001, owned by Harry Needle Railroad Company (HNRC), and 07007, owned by Knights Rail Services, are mainline registered. All surviving locomotives are listed below.
* 07001 – Formerly HNRC, now preserved by Heritage Shunters Trust at Peak Rail. Fully operational, currently repainted into a blue livery with &#x27;wasp&#x27; ends but without numbering (as of 1 September 2013).
* 07005 – Preserved at the Great Central Railway
* 07007 – In use by Knights Rail Services at Eastleigh Works. Mainline registered in April 2008. Currently painted in Rail Blue livery.
* 07010 – Preserved on Avon Valley Railway in BR Blue livery. Currently awaiting repairs following electrical failure December 2014. Repainted into BR Blue September 2013.
* 07011 – Privately owned at St Leonards TMD. Rail Blue livery.
* 07012 – Formerly HNRC, now preserved at Barrow Hill.
* 07013 – Formerly HNRC, externally restored in Rail Blue livery Now at the East Lancashire Railway.

==Class summary==
==Technical details==
* Engine: Ruston/Paxman 6RPHL Mk. 3, 60° V6, 29.3-litre, 6-cylinder, indirect injection, 4-stroke
* Main Generator: AEI RTB6652
* Traction motor: AEI RTA6652, spigot mounted on a double reduction, axle-hung, final drive gearbox

Locomotive (air) and train (vacuum) brakes were fitted from new. Air train braking was added later, in some cases with high-level air brake pipes for use with Southern Region electric multiple units. Originally the class had radio communication sets fitted for use at Southampton Docks, the aerial located on the top right-hand corner of the engine bonnet. These were removed when operation at the docks ceased.

== Models ==
Class 07 is available as a kit and a ready-to-run model in OO gauge by Heljan.

<doc id="577759" wikidata="Q5261065" url="?curid=577759" title="Deputy Prime Minister of Australia">
<text>The deputy prime minister of Australia is the deputy chief executive and the second highest ranking officer of the Australian Government. The office of deputy prime minister was officially created as a ministerial portfolio in 1968, although the title had been used informally for many years previously. The deputy prime minister is appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister. When Australia has a Labor government, the deputy leader of the parliamentary party holds the position of deputy prime minister. When Australia has a Coalition government, the Coalition Agreement mandates that all Coalition members support the leader of the Liberal Party becoming prime minister and the leader of the National Party becoming the deputy prime minister.

The 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis resulted in the position being made vacant for the first time since its official creation. Barnaby Joyce, the then-incumbent, was ruled ineligible to be a member of parliament by the High Court of Australia sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns on 27 October 2017, as he held New Zealand citizenship at the time of his election in contravention of Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia. Julie Bishop would act in the place of the prime minister during the vacancy in the deputy premiership. Joyce regained the position on 6 December 2017 after he won the by-election for the seat of New England several days earlier.

==History==

Originally the position of deputy prime minister was an unofficial or honorary position accorded to the second-highest ranking minister in the government. The unofficial position acquired more significance following the 1922 federal election, which saw the governing Nationalist Party lose its parliamentary majority. The Nationalists eventually reached a coalition agreement with the Country Party, which called for Country Party leader Earle Page to take the second rank in the Nationalist-led ministry of Stanley Bruce. While Page&#x27;s only official title was Treasurer, he was considered as a deputy to Bruce.

Although no office of that name had officially been created, by 1946 the title &quot;deputy prime minister&quot; was being used in the &quot;Commonwealth of Australia Gazette&quot;.

From then until 1968, the Coalition agreement between the Liberals (and their predecessors) and Country Party called for the leader of the Country Party (subsequently the National Party) to rank second in Cabinet. That continues to be case when the Coalition is in government. In the case of Labor governments, the party&#x27;s deputy leader ranks second in Cabinet.

On 19 December 1967, John McEwen, the long-serving leader of the Country Party in the Coalition government, was sworn in as interim prime minister following the sudden disappearance and presumed death of Prime Minister Harold Holt. There was discussion that deputy Liberal leader and Treasurer William McMahon should assume the office. McMahon had planned a party room meeting on 20 December to elect a new leader, intending to stand for the position himself. However, this was pre-empted by McEwen who publicly declared on the morning of 18 December that he would not serve in a McMahon government. McEwen was sworn in as prime minister on the understanding that his commission would continue only so long as it took for the Liberals to elect a new leader. Governor-General Lord Casey also accepted the view put to him by McEwen that to commission a Liberal temporarily as prime minister would give that person an unfair advantage in the forthcoming party room ballot for the permanent leader. McEwen&#x27;s appointment was in keeping with the previous occasion when the main non-Labor party was without a leader; Earle Page of the Country Party was interim prime minister between 7 and 26 April 1939—the period between Joseph Lyons&#x27; sudden death and the United Australia Party naming Robert Menzies his successor.

The Liberal leadership ballot was rescheduled for 9 January 1968. As it turned out, McMahon did not stand, and Senator John Gorton was elected, replacing McEwen as prime minister on 10 January 1968. McEwen reverted to his previous status as the second-ranking member of the government, as per the Coalition agreement. He had unofficially been deputy prime minister since becoming Country Party leader in 1958, and since 1966 had exercised an effective veto over government policy by virtue of being the longest-serving member of the government; he had been a member of the Coalition frontbench without interruption since 1937. To acknowledge McEwen&#x27;s long service and his status as the second-ranking member of the government, Gorton formally created the post of deputy prime minister, with McEwen as the first holder of the post.

According to parliamentary records, in the time before the position of deputy prime minister was officially created, the position was known as &quot;deputy leader of the Government.&quot;

Since 1968 only three deputy prime ministers have gone on to become prime minister, all of them are Labor Party&#x27;s politicians: Paul Keating, Julia Gillard, and Anthony Albanese. Both Keating and Gillard succeeded incumbent prime ministers who lost the support of their party caucus mid-term. Meanwhile, Albanese who briefly served as deputy prime minister in 2013, later led the Labor party to victory at the 2022 Australian federal election, and was sworn-in as prime minister on 23 May 2022. Frank Forde, who had been deputy Labor leader when John Curtin died, was interim prime minister between 6 and 13 July 1945, when a leadership ballot took place that elected Ben Chifley as Curtin&#x27;s successor.

In November 2007, when the Labor Party won government, Julia Gillard became Australia&#x27;s first female, and first foreign-born, deputy prime minister.

In 2017, the position became vacant for a period of 40 days, the only time in its history when it has been unoccupied. As part of the 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, it emerged that the then-incumbent Barnaby Joyce was a citizen of New Zealand by descent (&quot;jus sanguinis&quot; – by right of blood) at the time of the 2016 federal election. Joyce told the House of Representatives that he was advised of his citizenship status on 10 August 2017 by the New Zealand High Commission and his renunciation of his dual citizenship became effective on 15 August 2017. Nevertheless, he asked for his case to be referred to the High Court of Australia (sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns) for adjudication, and they ruled that his election was invalid under section 44 of the Constitution of Australia. The government immediately issued writs for a by-election for the seat of New England to be held on 2 December 2017, which Joyce won easily. Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove re-appointed Joyce as deputy prime minister on 6 December 2017.

In practice, only National Party leaders or Labor Party deputy leaders have held the position.

==Duties==
The deputy prime minister has always been a member of the Cabinet, and has always held at least one substantive portfolio.

=== Succession ===

The deputy prime minister becomes acting prime minister if the prime minister is unable to undertake their role for a short time, for example if they are ill, overseas or on leave (and if both are unavailable, then another senior minister takes on this role). If the prime minister were to die, then the deputy prime minister would be appointed prime minister by the governor-general, until the government votes for another member to be its leader.

==Salary==
Members of parliament receive a base salary of $203,030, which is set by the Remuneration Tribunal (an independent statutory authority). Ministers receive an additional amount, which is determined by the government itself based on the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal. The deputy prime minister receives an additional 105 percent of the base salary, making for a total salary of $416,212. The holder of the office also receives various other allowances and entitlements.

<doc id="577762" wikidata="Q2002451" url="?curid=577762" title="Republic of Singapore Air Force">
<text>The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is the aerial service branch of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) responsible for controlling and defending the airspace of the country, and providing air support to the Army and Navy. It was established in 1968 as the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC) before renaming to its current name in 1975. 

As one of the larger and more technologically advanced air forces in Southeast Asia, the RSAF has undertaken a significant role in Singapore&#x27;s military defence strategy since its formation. The RSAF is one of the more modern air forces in the region, with the ability to act as a strong deterrence from potential hostile nations as well as defending the airspace of the country. 

The RSAF currently has four domestic airbases – Paya Lebar, Changi, Sembawang and Tengah – as well as at the civilian airport of Seletar. The RSAF also has overseas detachments in various countries, most notably in Australia, France, Thailand and the United States. As of 2023, the RSAF has a strength of 6,000 active personnel.

==History==
===Early years===
In January 1968, the United Kingdom, which by this time had lost most of its global prestige especially after the Suez Crisis and was facing major financial difficulties that were greatly exacerbated by the devaluation of the pound, announced the imminent withdrawal of all its troops &quot;East of Suez&quot; by the end of 1971. Prior to then, Singapore had depended heavily on Britain&#x27;s Royal Air Force (RAF) for its air defence, while the newly established Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) had concentrated its efforts mainly on building up the land-based Singapore Army.

The predecessor to the RSAF, the SADC, was formed on 1 September 1968. The SADC&#x27;s immediate task was to set up the Flying Training School to train pilots. Qualified flying instructors were obtained through Airwork Services Limited, a company specialising in defence services. Basic training for pilots was carried out using two Cessna light aircraft hired from the Singapore Flying Club. The SADC also enlisted the help of the Royal Air Force which introduced the first flying training syllabus and provided two ex-RAF pilots as instructors, as well as facilities and services at Seletar Airport. Finally, the first batch of six pilot trainees were sent to the United Kingdom in August 1968 to undergo training in various technical disciplines. The training was based on the Hawker Hunter, the SADC&#x27;s first air defence fighter. The following month, another pioneer group of technicians, this time from the rotary wing, were sent to France to begin their technical training on the Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopter. In 1969, a number of local RAF technicians were released to join the fledgling SADC. These local
technicians (local other ranks) had experience working on fixed-wing RAF aircraft such as the Hawker Hunter, Gloster Javelin, English Electric Canberra, English Electric Lightning and Avro Shackleton; as well as rotary-wing RAF aircraft such as the Bristol Belvedere, Westland Wessex and Westland Whirlwind.

Eight Cessna 172K aircraft—the SADC&#x27;s first—arrived in May 1969 to be used for basic pilot training. By December, the first batch of students completed the course. Of these, six were sent to the UK to receive further training. On their return to Singapore in 1970, they were ready to operate the then newly acquired Hawker Hunter fighter aircraft.

The pace of training pilots and ground crew picked up gradually. On 1 August 1969, Minister for the Interior and Defence, Lim Kim San, inaugurated the Flying Training School (FTS) at Tengah Air Base (then known as RAF Tengah). The inauguration of FTS brought SADC closer to its goal of fulfilling the heavy responsibility of defending Singapore&#x27;s airspace.

The subsequent arrival of the BAC Strikemasters in 1969, used for advanced phase flying training, meant that pilot trainees were now able to earn their initial wings locally rather than overseas. The first batch of locally trained fighter pilots were trained at the FTS and graduated in November 1970. Amongst this batch was 2LT Goh Yong Siang, who later rose to the appointment of Chief of Air Force on 1 July 1995. Gradually, the SADC had its own pilots, flying instructors, air traffic controllers, and ground crew.

When Britain brought forward its plan to withdraw its forces by September 1971, the SADC was suddenly entrusted with a huge responsibility and resources. Britain&#x27;s former air bases—Tengah, Seletar, Sembawang and Changi—were handed over to the SADC, as well as its air defence radar station and Bloodhound II surface-to-air missiles.

In 1973, the SADC procured Shorts Skyvan search-and-locate aircraft and Douglas A-4 Skyhawk fighter-bombers. With a reliable mix of fighters, fighter-bombers, helicopters and transport aircraft, the SADC was ready to assume the functions of a full-fledged air force. On 1 April 1975, the SADC was renamed the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).

One of its first commanders was LTC Ee Tean Chye.

===21st century===
The RSAF celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018 with the theme &quot;Our Home, Above All&quot;. The RSAF celebrated its Golden Jubilee with an extended flypast during the national day parade on 9 August and also performed 2 sessions of aerial display at the Marina Barrage on 11 and 12 August.

Combat operations
* 2004–2008: Multi-National Force – Iraq. Aircraft participated in the Iraq War and returned home after two or three months of deployment in the Persian Gulf without any ground troops involved. Singapore&#x27;s withdrawal was acknowledged on 23 December 2008.

==Organisation==

===Commands and units===
On 5 January 2007, Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean announced that the Air Force organisation chart will be re-structured into five major commands, namely the Air Defence and Operations Command (ADOC), the Air Combat Command (ACC), the Participation Command (PC), the Air Power Generation Command (APGC) and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Command (UC). The first to be inaugurated was ADOC, along the restructuring announcement.

ADOC is the principal agency in charge of planning and executing peacetime operations and air defence. ADOC is also responsible for the development and operational readiness of the command and control and ground-based air defence units of the RSAF.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Command was the second command to be inaugurated and become operational in May 2007.

The next command to be inaugurated was PC in January 2008.

The last two commands, ACC and APGC, were inaugurated together in August 2008 in conjunction with the RSAF 40th Anniversary. The ACC will bring together fighter and transport squadrons under one command, with central planning, control and execution of the air battle in operations. The APGC will enhance the missions of the ACC by ensuring that all air bases remain operational at all times, as well as improving the servicing and turn-around of aircraft to ensure continuous and responsive operations.

====Air Combat Command (ACC)====
The ACC (&quot;Poised And Deadly&quot;) is responsible for the planning, control and execution of the air battle in operations.

The backbone of the RSAF is formed by the Block 52/52+ F-16 Fighting Falcons. These are armed with US-supplied AIM-120C AMRAAM missiles and LANTIRN targeting pods, laser guided munitions and conformal fuel tanks for long-range strike.

While Singapore initially bought as many as 70 F-16 planes, on 18 November 2004, it was announced that the RSAF would offer its remaining 7 F-16A/Bs to the Royal Thai Air Force. It is believed that these early Block 15OCU aircraft were upgraded to &quot;Falcon One&quot; standard by ST Aerospace before the transfer and delivered in late 2005. In return, the RSAF was permitted to train at the Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base in north-east Thailand for a specified number of days each year. This would mean that the RSAF will operate only the Block 52/52+ model, as many as 62 F-16CJ/DJ planes.

Due to severe airspace constraints within Singapore, the RSAF operates its aircraft at several overseas locations to provide greater exposure to its pilots. With the F-16C/D Fighting Falcons, KC-135R Stratotankers, AH-64D Apaches and CH-47SD Chinook helicopters based in the United States, the Marchetti S-211s, PC-21s, and Super Puma helicopters in Australia, and the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master in France, almost one third of the force&#x27;s inventory is based outside Singapore.

In 1994, the RSAF commenced a modernisation program for its fleet of approximately 49 operational (R)F-5E and F-5F aircraft. The upgrade was performed by Singapore Technologies Aerospace (STAero) and the upgraded aircraft were designated (R)F-5S and F-5T respectively, operating from Paya Lebar Air Base. These upgraded F-5S/T, equipped with the Galileo Avionica&#x27;s FIAR Grifo-F X-band Radar are thought to be capable of firing the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile but to date, no actual live-firing has actually been reported. For in-flight refuelling, four KC-135Rs and four KC-130Bs are commissioned to support the fighter force of F-16C/Ds and (R)F-5S/Ts.

Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) capability was introduced in 1987 when four E-2C Hawkeyes were delivered to 111 Squadron. The duty of Maritime Patrol and Coastal surveillance is performed by the eight Fokker 50 MPA (entered service in 1991) of 121 Squadron, which can be armed with long-range anti-shipping AGM-84 Harpoon missiles and ASW torpedoes.

As part of its fleet renewal process, the RSAF officially withdrew its fleet of ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk from front-line service on 31 March 2005 after 31 years of operations. The A-4SUs&#x27; achievements included flying directly from Singapore to the Philippines, incorporating the RSAF&#x27;s first air-to-air refuelling mission in 1986, as well as the excellent aerobatic display of the &#x27;red and white&#x27; Super Skyhawks flown by the RSAF Black Knights during Asian Aerospace 1990. A month before its retirement, the Skyhawk squadron won top honours in a strike exercise against its more modern F-16 and F-5 counterparts.

Singapore ordered a total of twenty AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicopters in two batches. After a long period of negotiations over the delivery of the sophisticated Longbow Fire-control radar, the first batch of eight aircraft, fitted with the Fire Control Radar, was delivered on 17 May 2002. The second batch of 12 Apaches were ordered in 2001 even before the first delivery took place. All of the initial eight Apaches are based in the United States. Three of the Apache Longbows returned in January 2006 at the request of the Minister of Defence.

Apart from the fifteen CH-47SDs delivered from 1996, a new batch of fifteen aircraft was ordered in 1997, with an option of four extra airframes. At least 30 CH-47SD have been delivered and are in service at Sembawang Air Base. It is believed that these had been upgraded to the SD standard prior to delivery.

Eight CH-47SDs were also deployed to support the relief efforts in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. It was the first and one of the few countries to reach the affected areas. The RSAF deployed dozens of C-130Hs, CH-47SDs and AS 332Ms there along with three of the RSN&#x27;s latest Landing Ship Tanks (RSS Endurance, RSS Persistence and RSS Endeavour of the &quot;Endurance&quot; class LST) as well as Singapore Armed Forces vehicles, engineers, and medical teams.

In September 2005, the RSAF sent three CH-47SD Chinook helicopters, later augmented by a fourth CH-47SD Chinook, to provide assistance in the rescue and evacuation of stranded civilians after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans and nearby areas in the United States. The humanitarian effort by Singapore involved more aircraft than any other foreign countries.

Since 2003, the RSAF has also made deployments of KC-135 tankers and C-130 aircraft to the Persian Gulf in support of the multinational efforts for the reconstruction of Iraq. RSAF personnel have carried out airlift, transportation and supply, and air-to-air refuelling missions in support of the multinational forces, assisting the Coalition in carrying supplies and personnel, transporting humanitarian material and conducting medical evacuation operations. In September 2013, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen stated in a parliamentary reply that Singapore would soon acquire the Aster 30 land-based missile system.

RSAF day is celebrated on 1 September annually, in 2018 a combined flypast including the new A330 MRTT with a special 50th anniversary livery took place at Tengah Air Base.

==Personnel==

Military ranks in the Singapore Armed Forces are identical across the three services except for the flag ranks of the RSN. They are based on the Army model. The official table of ranks stops at three stars for all three services.

Like the Navy, the majority of Air Force personnel are regulars. This is due to the specialised and technical nature of many jobs. The employment of National Servicemen in various roles are limited mostly to the infantry-like Field Defence Squadrons which do not require such specialised training.

==Aircraft==
In February 2003, Singapore joined the JSF program&#x27;s System Design and Development (SDD) Phase, as a Security Co-operation Participant (SCP). The first deliveries of the F-35 Lightning II are not expected before 2021, but replacement for the bulk of the A-4SUs was needed by 2007. As a start, 20 F-16D Block 52+ have been delivered from 2003 under project Peace Carvin IV.

The RSAF embarked on its Next Generation Fighter (NGF) programme to replace the aging A-4SUs. The original list of competitors was shortlisted to the final two – Dassault Rafale and the Boeing F-15SG Strike Eagle. The F-15SG is a variant of the F-15E Strike Eagle and is similar in configuration to the F-15K sold to South Korea, but differs in the addition of the APG-63(V)3 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar developed by Raytheon. The F-15SG is powered by two General Electric F110-GE-129 thrust engines. The DSTA (Defense Science &amp; Technology Agency) conducted a detailed technical assessment, simulations, and other tests to assess the final selection. On 6 September 2005, it was announced that the F-15SG had won the contract over the Rafale. An initial order placed in 2005 for 12 aircraft with the option to purchase 8 more. On 22 October 2007, Singapore&#x27;s Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) exercised the option to purchase eight more F-15SG fighters as part of the original contract signed in 2005. Along with this buy, an additional order for four F-15SGs was made, bringing the total number of F-15SGs purchased by the start of 2008 to 24.

In January 2005, it was announced that 6 Sikorsky S-70B (derivative of SH-60 Seahawk) naval helicopters will be purchased, complete with anti-surface and anti-submarine weapons and sensors. 2 more Seahawks were ordered in 2013. The Seahawks are operated by RSAF pilots, with System Specialists of the Republic of Singapore Navy operating the sensors and weaponry. They operate from the Navy&#x27;s new &quot;Formidable&quot; class frigates, and when operating from land are based at Sembawang Air Base. All 20 AH-64D Longbow attack helicopters have been delivered to the RSAF. 12 of these were deployed back to Singapore and took part in combined arms exercises with the Army, with the remaining 8 helicopters being part of the Peace Vanguard detachment based in the United States.

In April 2007, it was announced that the 4 E-2C Hawkeyes were to be replaced with 4 Gulfstream G550s fitted with the IAI EL/W-2085 radar which would become the primary airborne early warning aircraft for the RSAF. Not included in the deal is an additional G550 as an AEW trainer, which will be acquired and maintained by ST Aerospace on behalf of RSAF.
In July 2010, the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master was selected by the RSAF to replace the A-4SU in the Advanced Jet Training (AJT) role, currently based at BA 120 Cazaux Air Base in France. In a press release by the MINDEF on 28 September 2008, ST Aerospace had been awarded the contract to acquire twelve M-346 and a ground based training system on behalf of RSAF. As stipulated in the contract, ST Aerospace will act as the main contractor to maintain the aircraft after delivery by Alenia Aermacchi while Boeing would supply the training system. Delivery date is scheduled from 2012 onwards.

The backbone of the transport fleet are the four KC-130B, one KC-130H and five C-130H Hercules transport aircraft, which are expected to remain in service through 2030, will be undergoing an extensive modernisation process to bring all ten existing airframes to the same common standard. The first airframe, a KC-130B, was returned to frontline service on 21 September 2010. ST Aerospace, the main contractor behind the project, is expected to upgrade the other nine airframes for the RSAF within the next seven years. Included in the package is the replacement of cockpit flight management system with a modern glass cockpit avionics suite, central engine displays to replace analogue gauges, improved voice communications, digital autopilot, flight director as well as a digital weather radar, which will make the aircraft Global Air Traffic Management-compliant. Also, the C-130Bs will receive an auxiliary power unit and environmental control system in common with the C-130Hs. Once the upgrade is completed, this will effectively give the RSAF five KC-130Hs and five C-130Hs.

In December 2010, the RSAF issued a letter of request to inspect stored ex-US Navy P-3C Orion aircraft that have been retired from active duty. Lockheed Martin believes the RSAF has a requirement of 4 to 5 of these aircraft, which would be modernised extensively before reintroduction into active service.

On 30 June 2018, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen announced that the F-16&#x27;s replacement will be announced soon. Meanwhile, the KC-135Rs are being replaced by the A330 MRTT while replacements for other fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters are announced.

On 18 January 2019, MINDEF officially confirmed the procurement of F-35s for a full evaluation of their capabilities and suitability before deciding on a full fleet to replace the aging F-16 fleet. On 1 March 2019, MINDEF announced that they will send a Letter of Request (LOR) to purchase 4 F-35s with an option of 8 more after the evaluation. On 9 January 2020 the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved a possible sale to Singapore of four F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) variants with the option to purchase an additional eight F-35Bs and up to 13 Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engines and other related equipment for an estimated total cost of $2.75 billion. On 24 February 2023, MINDEF exercised its option and purchased an additional 8 F-35Bs currently on track for delivery by 2028, with the originally purchased 4 expected to be delivered by 2026. On 28 February 2024, Dr Ng Eng Hen announced in parliament the procurement of 8 F-35A&#x27;s expected to be delivered by 2030, tallying up a total of 20 F-35&#x27;s on delivery.

<text>The Rolls-Royce WR-21 is a gas turbine marine engine, designed with a view to powering the latest naval surface combatants of the partner nations.

==History==
Developed with government funding input from the United Kingdom, France and the United States, the WR-21 was designed and manufactured by an international consortium led by Northrop Grumman as prime contractor. The turbine itself was designed primarily by Rolls-Royce with significant marine engineering and test facility input from DCN, with Northrop Grumman responsible for the intercooler, the recuperator and system integration.

WR-21 development draws heavily on the technology of the successful Rolls-Royce RB211 and Trent families of gas turbines.

The original design and development of the WR-21 was carried out by Westinghouse Electric Corporation (later Northrop Grumman Marine Systems) under a US Navy contract placed in December 1991. Later the Royal Navy and the French Navy became interested in the WR-21, leading to Rolls-Royce and DCN involvement.

The WR-21 is the propulsion system of Royal Navy Type 45 destroyers.

==Design==
The WR-21 is the first aeroderivative gas turbine to incorporate gas compressor intercooler and exhaust heat recovery system technologies that deliver low specific fuel consumption across the engine&#x27;s operating range. It offers a reduction in fuel burn of 30% across the typical ship operating profile.

*The intercooler cools air entering the high-pressure compressor, reducing the amount of energy required to compress the air.
*The recuperator preheats the combustion air by recovering waste heat from the exhaust, improving cycle efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.

==Specifications==

* Rated power: 25.2 MW
* Specific fuel consumption: approximately 
* Main module wet weight: 
* Twin-spool gas generator and free-rotating power turbine
** Low-pressure (LP) spool with six-stage compressor and single-stage turbine at 6,200 rpm
** High-pressure (HP) spool with six-stage compressor and single-stage turbine at 8,100 rpm
** Five-stage free power turbine 3,600 rpm (60 Hz)
* Intercooler between LP and HP compressors
* Nine radial combustors
* Exhaust heat recuperator to combustor inlet air

==Operational issues==
In 2009 it was discovered that the Northrop Grumman intercooler as fitted in the WR-21, on Type 45 destroyers, had a major design flaw, failing to operate in water temperatures beyond 30C. The intercooler of the first Type 45 destroyer, , failed in the mid-Atlantic in 2010 and had to be repaired in Canada, with further repairs for intercooler failure in 2012 in Bahrain. The Type 45&#x27;s pioneering integrated electric propulsion (IEP) system uses two WR-21s and two Wartsila 2-MW diesel generators to power everything on board, including weapons systems in addition to propulsion and other functions, leaving the ships vulnerable to &quot;total electric failure&quot;. The Ministry of Defence said: &quot;The Type 45 was designed for world-wide operations, from sub-Arctic to extreme tropical environments, and continues to operate effectively in the Gulf and the South Atlantic all year round.&quot;

The WR-21 engines will have to be supplemented by one or two additional diesel generators, fitted by cutting open the hull in dry dock.

Former First Sea Lord Admiral Philip Jones clarified that &quot;WR-21 gas turbines were designed in extreme hot weather conditions to what we call “gracefully degrade” in their performance, until you get to the point where it goes beyond the temperature at which they would operate... we found that the resilience of the diesel generators and the WR-21 in the ship at the moment was not degrading gracefully; it was degrading catastrophically, so that is what we have had to address.&quot; The Admiral still argued that despite the problems, the Royal Navy has been able to deploy Type 45 destroyers in nine-month cycles to the Gulf region where temperatures are high with little fault. The Royal Navy has also been able to maintain at least two Type 45s at operational readiness.

<text>The changeable hawk-eagle &quot;(Nisaetus cirrhatus)&quot; or crested hawk-eagle is a large bird of prey species of the family Accipitridae. More informal or antiquated English common names include the marsh hawk-eagle or Indian crested hawk-eagle. It is a member of the subfamily Aquilinae, with signature feathers, absent in tropical raptors from outside this subfamily, covering the tarsus. It was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Spizaetus&quot;, but studies pointed to the group being paraphyletic resulting in the Old World members being placed in &quot;Nisaetus&quot; and separated from the New World species. It is a typical &quot;hawk-eagle&quot; in that it is an agile forest-dwelling predator and like many such eagles readily varies its prey selection between birds, mammals or reptiles as well as other vertebrates. Among the members of its genus, the changeable hawk-eagle stands out as the most widely distributed, adaptable and abundant species. Individuals show a wide range of variation in plumage from pale to dark, varying with moult and age giving rise to the name &quot;changeable&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The changeable hawk-eagle was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the eagles, hawks and relatives in the genus &quot;Falco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Falco cirrhatus&quot;. Gmelin&#x27;s description was based on the &quot;crested Indian falcon&quot; or the &quot;Falco Indicus cirratus&quot; that had been first described in 1676 by the English naturalists Francis Willughby and John Ray from a live bird kept in the Royal Aviary in St James&#x27;s Park, London. The changeable hawk-eagle was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Spizaetus&quot; but it and nine other Old World hawk-eagles were moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Nisaetus&quot; following the publication in 2005 and 2007 of two molecular phylogentic studies. The genus &quot;Nisaetus&quot; had been introduced in 1836 by the English naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson. The genus name &quot;Nisaetus&quot; combines the Medieval Latin &quot;nisus&quot; for a sparrowhawk with the Ancient Greek &quot;aetos&quot; meaning &quot;eagle&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;cirrhatus&quot; is from Latin &quot;cirratus&quot; meaning &quot;curly-headed&quot;.

The taxonomy of the wide-ranging changeable hawk-eagle is complex and confusing, with few authorities agreeing on whether the species in fact houses a species complex. Gamauf &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) analyzed mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and control region sequence data of a considerable number of specimens of the crested hawk-eagle and some relatives. Despite the large sample, even the most conspicuous dichotomy - that between the crested and crestless groups - was not as well resolved as it might have been expected to be. At least one widely accepted genetic study has resulted in a recent revision to the recognition of a new species, as the Flores hawk-eagle has traditionally been treated as a subspecies of the changeable hawk-eagle, but it is now often treated as a separate species, &quot;N. floris&quot;. The Flores and changeable hawk-eagles are regarded as sister species. The three small-island taxa (&quot;N. c. andamanensis&quot;, &quot;N. c. vanheurni&quot;, and &quot;N. floris&quot;) as a whole each appear as monophyletic lineages. Their placement is even more unresolved, with &quot;N. floris&quot; being apparently a very ancient lineage. The other two seem quite certainly to derive from &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot;. The latter taxon has a confusing phylogeny. Different lineages exist that are apparently not stable in space and time, are best described as polytomy, from which the similar island taxa derive. Obviously, &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; does not represent a monophyletic lineage. Neither the biological nor the phylogenetic species concepts, nor phylogenetic systematics can be applied to satisfaction. The crested group apparently is close to becoming a distinct species. The island taxa derived from &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; appear to have undergone founder effects, which has restricted their genetic diversity. In the continental population, genetic diversity is considerable, and the evolutionary pattern of the two studied genes did not agree, and neither did the origin of specimens show clear structures. &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; thus is best considered a metapopulation.

Gamauf &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) therefore suggest the island taxa which are obviously at higher risk of extinction are, for conservation considered evolutionary significant units regardless of their systematic status. This case also demonstrates that a too-rigid interpretation of cladistics and the desire for monophyletic taxa, as well as universal application of single-species concept to all birds will undermine correct understanding of evolutionary relationships. It would even not be inconceivable to find mainland lineages to group closely with the western island taxa, if little genetic drift had occurred in the initial population. nonetheless, the divergence of this species&#x27; lineages seems to have taken place too recently to award them species status, as compared to the level of genetic divergence at which clades are usually considered distinct species. &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; appears for all that can be said with reasonable certainty basal pool of lineages in the crestless group that, despite not being monophyletic, should be considered a valid taxon as long as gene flow is possible through its range. In addition, as ancient DNA from museum specimens was used extensively, the possibility of ghost lineages must be considered. If it is assumed that all or most of the ancient lineages still exist today, considerable recombination must have taken place as the two genes&#x27; phylogenies do not agree much, indicating a healthy level of gene flow. Whether this still holds true today remains to be determined.

Two distinct groups exist in the changeable hawk-eagle; one with crests and one without or with hardly visible crests. A 2020 study found that the reproductive isolation between the two groups was weak and recommended treating the two groups as conspecific. Dark morphs exist for some populations.

===Subspecies===

Changeable hawk-eagle group
* &quot;N. c. cirrhatus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) : The nominate subspecies is found in the peninsular India, from the Gangetic plain southwards throughout the remainder of the country. It is monomorphic in colour with no dark morph. The nominate subspecies is relatively pale above compared to other races, with a slightly more rufous hue to the head. It tends to be less extensively streaked below down to the lower breast below compared to other races, with dark wing lings and a strongly barred tail. In the juvenile plumage, the nominate race has a strongly buffy headed and has underparts that are flecked and spotted. The crest tends to be longest in this race, with common measurements of in length, therefore the race is commonly referred to as the crested hawk-eagle. It is one of the two larger subspecies. Wing chord length ranges from in males and from in females. In both sexes, the tail commonly measures and tarsus from .
* &quot;N. c. ceylanensis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788): This race is endemic to Sri Lanka but some authorities also include Travancore in the southern tip of India as part of this race&#x27;s range. This race has a proportionally longer crest on average than the nominate race, with a similar crest length to it at about . It is monomorphic as is the nominate race, averaging paler and less streaky, but a similar appearance has been noted to birds from southernmost India are rather similar in appearance. The differences represented in this race from the nominate race are largely clinal. It is rather smaller than the nominate race. Wing chord length ranges from in males and from in females. Furthermore, in both sexes tail length is from and tarsus length from .

Crestless changeable hawk-eagle group

* &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; (Horsfield, 1821): This race is found through the Himalayan foothills from Nepal, northeast India, via Burma to much of southeast Asia including the Malay Peninsula along Wallace Line to Philippines and the Greater Sunda Islands. This race can appear similar in size and build to the nominate race but unlike it is rather polymorphic and this is the most widely found of subspecies. This race&#x27;s polymorphism is the source for the species being referred to as the changeable hawk-eagle. The pale morph of this race is still darker than the nominate race found further south in India. However, pale morphs from the Philippines tend to have a paler head and neck. Characteristically, this race is heavily streaked below, while juveniles look quite different as their head and underparts are largely white. Dark morph individuals tend to be chocolate-brown all over, although the tail base might appear lighter in flight. Some birds of this race do have a vestigial crest of merely in length but many appear to completely lack the crest. This race is generally similar in size to the nominate race but is more variable in size over its large distribution within the southernmost island birds averaging smallest while those found in the Himalayan foothills are arguably the largest hawk-eagles known in the species. Wing chord length ranges from in males and from in females. In limited samples, tail length was reported as and tarsus length from . A sample of 6 females averaged in the length of the rear hallux-claw, the main killing apparatus of most accipitrids, while 7 males averaged .
* &quot;N. c. andamanensis&quot; (Tytler, 1865): This race is found in the Andaman Islands. The subspecies is darker than the nominate subspecies and more similar to &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; in hue but does not appear to have a full dark morph as is known in that race. Andamanian juveniles tend to have a rather white head and underpart colour. A crest may variably be present but is usually only up to . This race is small, a little smaller even than &quot;N. c. ceylanensis&quot;. Wing chord length ranges from in males and from in females.
* &quot;N. c. vanheurni&quot; (Junge, 1936): This race is native to Simeulue Island. It is similar in appearance to &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot;, but apparently lacks a dark morph. The subspecies is also much less heavily blotched black on its whiter looking breast and never bears a crest. It is the smallest accepted subspecies of the changeable hawk-eagle, considerably smaller than &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot;. Wing chord was measured as in a single male and in a small sample of females.

==Description==

The changeable hawk-eagle is a largish but slender eagle. They fall near the middle of sizes among the currently accepted species in the genus &quot;Nisaetus&quot;. As in most birds of prey, females are larger than males with an average overall size difference of 7% but this can individually range to an 18-22% difference, with island races apparently thought to be less dimorphic on average. Size is quite variable and total length has been reported in the past to vary from and wingspan from , however these figures appear to include the much more massive hawk-eagles from Flores that are currently considered their own separate species by modern authorities. Nonetheless, total lengths of up to have been listed for &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; in Nepal. Ali &amp; Ripley (1978) estimated these average total lengths for the following subspecies: &quot;N. c. cirrhatus&quot; at , &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; at and &quot;N. c. andamanensis&quot; at . Legge (1880) measured the length of Sri Lankan changeable hawk-eagles (&quot;N. c. ceylanensis&quot;) without including the beak as . The average length of birds from the Philippines (&quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot;) was measured as in males and in females. Weights in this species have been reported from but the source of this is unclear and it probably underrepresents the size variation known to occur in the species. The only precise body masses known for the species are derived from the Philippine population, where males average and females average but they could weigh in excess of .

Adult changeable hawk-eagles are typically dark brown above and boldly streaked below with a strong bill, a variably sized, often floppy crest or no crest, rather short wings, a quite long, thinly-barred tail and long feathered legs. This species tends to perch bolt upright, and may perch in various places from somewhat secluded spots to also quite open area as well. When perched, their wings reach only about one-third to halfway down tail. Pale morph adults are mainly dark brown above with very faint paler edges that are usually only conspicuous on the wing-coverts. They tend to have an evenly black-streaked and somewhat rufous-tinged head and neck, with a blackish crest (if present). The tail tends to be paler brown than the back with a thin whitish tip, a broad, blackish subterminal band (both the whitish tip and the subterminal band are also visible from tail underside) and 3 to 4 narrower, brown and often rather obscure bars. On the pale morph hawk-eagle&#x27;s underside, the base colour is white to buff overlaid with bold black to dark brown streaking; the streaking tends to be more subtle on abdomen but more obvious on the legs. Beyond the typical pale morph, some subspecies but especially &quot;N. c. liminaeetus&quot; tend to have a further intermediate and a dark morph. The intermediate morph is somewhat similar to pale morph adults but is heavily grey-brown below with little to no paler base colour showing and more obscure streaking, with the area from belly down to the crissum usually being unpatterned. Meanwhile, the dark morph adult can range from all dark chocolate brown to almost pure black with variable browner edges, relieved only by the greyish inner half of tail as well as some greyish tail bars. Most juvenile changeable hawk-eagles are dark brown above but with far more conspicuous white edges on mantle and wings than the adults, in some cases, the median coverts are largely white and greater and even lesser coverts are largely scaled with white. The juvenile has a light brown tail with about seven thin dark bars and a whitish tip. The young hawk-eagle&#x27;s head varies from buff with white-tipped black crest (as is the case in peninsular India and Sri Lanka) through entirely whitish, but almost always the young birds are spotted and streaked with black or dark brown about the rear crown and nape. As is the head, the underparts are variable with juveniles in much of India and in Sri Lanka showing thin brown streaks on chest or small spots on breast, with obscure tawny barring on thigh, legs and crissum. Juveniles elsewhere are often nearly all pure whitish below. By the time the young hawk-eagles reaches their 2nd to 3rd year, they tend to show less white above and more brown or black below. Their tail starts to molt to resemble that of adults in the 3rd year but in the 2nd year in &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; (or at least in Philippines). Changeable hawk-eagles may attempt to breed at 3 years of age but full adult plumage is not obtained until the 4th year. Adults have yellow to orange yellow eyes, while those of the juvenile are grey-brown to pale greenish. Adult have a cere that&#x27;s grey to pale greenish yellow and juveniles&#x27; ceres are dull greyish, while all ages have yellow feet.

In flight, the changeable hawk-eagles is a large raptor with a prominent head, rather short rounded and broad wings, longish squarish or rounded tail, but has somewhat slenderer wings and straighter trailing edges than sympatric species of hawk-eagles. The species tends to fly with a fast agile flight, showing powerful shallow beats interspersed with glides on flat or bowed wings with their carpals well forward (above level of bill) and primaries swept back. When soaring, the wings are gently lowered or sometimes held level, with the carpals again well forward. In pale morph adults in flight, their hand in flight may be variously dark brownish buff (as in peninsular India) to a much paler buff or whitish. On the flight feathers, the area from wingtips extending to the primary and secondary feathers often have blackish barring, forming ragged lines from the carpals to rear axillaries with variable other dark marks elsewhere. Adult intermediate morph hawk-eagles have similar flight feathers but have grey-brown underparts with a less distinct, contrasting under-pattern. Meanwhile, in both juvenile and adult dark morph, the blackish-brown colour of the body extends to the hand but the base of their tail, their primaries and, less so, their secondaries are a much paler, contrasting grey with streaking similar to other changeable hawk-eagles. Typical juveniles show large areas of whitish streaking or mottling seen from above in flight. Juveniles from much of India and Sri Lanka show extensive darker tawny but obscure barring above and below, while other races are much whiter. Much like adult, the juvenile has dark tips to primary and greater coverts produce thin ragged diagonal bars but the barring tends to be thinner.

===Voice===

The changeable hawk-eagle is often largely silent but in breeding season it may readily call, both from their perch or on the wing. Like many diurnal raptors, their calls are a form of high-pitched scream. The shrill ringing and loud call of the changeable hawk-eagle is various described in pattern of &quot;yeep-yip-yip-yip&quot;, rising &quot;kwip-kwip-kwip-kwee-ah&quot; and penetrating &quot;klee-leeuw&quot; (for birds from the Sunda islands). Ascending &quot;kri-kri-kri-kree-ah&quot; and &quot;kreeee-krit&quot; with much stress on the elongated first syllable are similar. From western birds from India and Sri Lanka, the call is a slightly different &quot;ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-keee&quot;, beginning short, rising in crescendo and ending in long, drawn-out scream. In northern India and Malaysia, the calls of this species have variously been compared to those of the Eurasian curlew (&quot;Numenius arquatus&quot;) and the crested serpent eagle (&quot;Spilornis cheela&quot;).

===Confusion species===

The changeable hawk-eagle is almost always the most common and/or most widely spread &quot;Nisaetus&quot; species anywhere in their range. Their distribution overlaps with the entirety of the distribution of the (newly recognized) Legge&#x27;s hawk-eagle (&quot;N. kelaarti&quot;), most of the range of the Javan (&quot;N. bartelsi&quot;), Blyth&#x27;s (&quot;N. alboniger&quot;) and Wallace&#x27;s hawk-eagle (&quot;N. nanus&quot;) and partially overlaps with the ranges of the mountain hawk-eagle (&quot;N. nipalensis&quot;), the Philippine hawk-eagle (&quot;N. philippinus&quot;) (on Mindoro and possibly Palawan) and Pinsker&#x27;s hawk-eagle (&quot;N. pinskeri&quot;) (on Mindanao). Only two species of the genus &quot;Nisaetus&quot; are outside the changeable hawk-eagle&#x27;s normal distribution (including their own former subspecies, the Flores hawk-eagle). In range with most other &quot;Nisaetus&quot; species (such as the islands or mainland of southeast Asia), the changeable hawk-eagle is more likely to be almost crestless. Other species tend to have proportionately broader wings with more bulging secondaries, relatively shorter tails and, as adults, more barred underbody and unique tail patterns. Adult colour patterns can range from somewhat different to boldly distinct (especially in the black-and-white Blyth&#x27;s hawk-eagle). Juveniles tend to be more difficult to distinguish but usually most other &quot;Nisaetus&quot; have less white showing than relevant changeable hawk-eagles and the changeable tends to show a slightly stronger V while in flight. The mountain hawk-eagle, Flores hawk-eagle (which is the only hawk-eagle in its small-island range) and Legge&#x27;s hawk-eagle, in decreasing magnitude of size, are all are larger and bulkier than the changeable hawk-eagle whereas other &quot;Nisaetus&quot; species are smaller to varying degrees, distinctly so in the Wallace&#x27;s hawk-eagle and Blyth&#x27;s hawk-eagle. As many honey buzzards are thought to mimic more powerful raptors to protect themselves from predation, the crested honey buzzard (&quot;Pernis ptilorhynchus&quot;) is thought to mimic the general appearance of &quot;Nisaetus&quot; hawk-eagles but has a distinctly smaller head and longer and narrower wings than changeable hawk-eagles. Adult crested honey buzzards are barred but the juvenile is streaked rather like the changeable hawk-eagle, however if seen well the honey buzzard generally looks much more solidly orange-buffy as a base colour rather than whitish below. The flight actions of the honey buzzard are also distinct, with a more robotic even flap during flights. Juvenile crested serpent eagles, which are unlikely to be mistaken for the changeable other than at a distance and in flight, appear chunkier and less rangy with a bigger head, slightly longer wings and a substantially shorter tailed with fewer bars (these differences in proportions are generally applicable to various island serpent-eagle species that may be found with changeable hawk-eagles as well). Juvenile rufous-bellied eagles (&quot;Lophotriorchis kienerii&quot;) are rather smaller and more compact with a relatively longer winged and shorter tailed appearance. The rufous-bellied juvenile when compared to the juvenile changeable is generally purer white looking below which contrasts more strongly with their sparse blackish streaks. Dark morph changeable hawk-eagles may be confused with the similarly sized but even more slender black eagle (&quot;Ictinaetus malaiensis&quot;). However, the latter is much longer winged with distinctly pinched-in bases, a uniformly dark tail and has small light feather bases only to primaries. Also dark morph can be told from dark morph booted eagles (&quot;Hieraeetus pennatus&quot;) by the latter being rather smaller, much shorter tailed and having relatively longer and more rectangular wings. Dark morph booted eagles are also grey-brown or cinnamon from below on the tail and have pale wedges on the underside of the primaries.

==Distribution and habitat==

The extensive range of the changeable hawk-eagle includes much of the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia. Their distribution includes nations and areas such as Sri Lanka, Himalayan foothills (Garhwal to Assam), southern Nepal and Bhutan east through Myanmar, Burma, western Laos, southern Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and peninsular Malaysia. In India, they may found almost continuously from the peninsular tip north to Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha. Its island distribution includes the Andamans, Sumatra (including Simeulue and Mentawai off the west side and Riau, Bangka and Belitung off of the east), Java, Borneo and the western and southern Philippines (including Palawan, Calamians, Lubang, Mindoro, Mindanao and apparently recently Bohol). Like most tropical raptors, the changeable hawk-eagle is largely residential, but stragglers from peninsular India have roamed to northeastern Burma and southeastern Thailand and some records in the Lesser Sunda Islands (Bali, Palau and Lombok) may be from vagrants from Java. The species may live in savannah woodland, cultivation with trees, timbered watercourses, tea plantations, forest villages and even suburban edge. Beyond these often degraded haunts they range as well as any of the more forest-clinging &quot;Nisaetus&quot; into fairly open or less dense parts of undisturbed vast evergreen (including tropical rainforest) or deciduous forests (their deciduous ranges mainly occurring in India and the Sunda islands), but also second growth and wetlands. In elevation, they may be found anywhere from sea level to but mainly live below . It is not uncommon in foothills of Sri Lanka but again does not usually exceed elevation there.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Changeable hawk-eagles are at home in a variety of wooded and semi-open habitats. Their physical form and flight style is typical of forest-dwelling raptors in general and is often compared to the features of true hawks or &quot;Accipiters&quot; in particular larger species such as goshawks. Like most other forest raptors, changeable hawk-eagles (and &quot;Nisaetus&quot; species in general) have a long tail, short broad wings and relatively long but powerful legs, all of which impart greater maneuverability and quicker strike times in denser wooded hunting grounds than other raptorial body plans. The common name hawk-eagle is apparently in reference to their similar adaptations to true hawks. Even compared to the variable prey of large goshawks, the prey selection of changeable hawk-eagles appears to be somewhat indiscriminate and opportunistic. Unfortunately, compared to tropical raptors from the neotropics and especially Africa, the life histories of raptors from tropical Asia are generally quite poorly-known, even in the case of easily observed raptors such as changeable hawk-eagles. Therefore, what is known of changeable hawk-eagles dietary biology is largely drawn together based on reliable eye-witness and anecdotal accounts, photographic evidence and wide-ranging bird census surveys, rather than direct, extensive study. The changeable hawk-eagle can show a slight preference for birds as prey, but also freely takes various mammals, reptiles and some other vertebrates whenever they opportune upon them. Although little quantitative analysis has gone into their dietary habits, many prey items taken are relatively small. On the other hand, Brown &amp; Amadon (1986) description of this species as &quot;not a very rapacious bird&quot; is not entirely justified as extremely large prey relative to the hawk-eagle&#x27;s size may also be readily taken. Like many tropical forest raptors, they are primarily ambush predators who use concealing foliage to still-hunt from hidden branch or open branch with a leafy background, pouncing fast to take most of their prey on the ground. Like goshawks, changeable hawk-eagles often perch-hunts which are short, low-level flights from perch to perch interspersed with brief pauses, during which they scan for potential prey. Perch-hunting lends them the greatest success when hunting birds that they will capture in the trees. At least a few cases have been observed of changeable hawk-eagles watching for and then dropping on prey directly from their own nest.
One of the only general analysis of the quantitative food preferences of the changeable hawk-eagle (although detailed prey analysis, including prey species, was not specified), was a study of this species in contrast with five other raptor species in the Maharashtra of India. This showed that they had a preference for birds as prey, with nearly equal number of birds classified as small or large making up nearly half of their diet in 14 active territories. Furthermore, their prey selection was found to be somewhat similar by class to that of Bonelli&#x27;s eagle (&quot;Aquila fasciata&quot;), an eagle of much more open and rocky habitats, but the changeable hawk-eagle took the highest class diversity of prey of any of the six raptors studied and was the only one to hunt near heavily wooded areas. Primary prey by class differed in West Java, where 62% of prey selected was reptiles, 24% birds and 12% mammals. Elsewhere in India, prey selection at the nest showed what prey species were selected by changeable hawk-eagles but lacked any quantitative data or studies on prey biomass. One study in Gujarat showed several rather small prey species largely being taken such as the Indian chameleon (&quot;Chamaeleo zeylanicus&quot;), Oriental garden lizard (&quot;Calotes versicolor&quot;), other lizards, common myna (&quot;Acridotheres tristis&quot;), red-vented bulbul (&quot;Pycnonotus cafer&quot;), other birds (including unidentified parakeets and gamebirds), Indian bush rat (&quot;Golunda ellioti&quot;) and a palm squirrel. The identified prey would vary in size only from for a garden lizard to for a myna with the small lizards and chameleons reportedly the most often delivered prey. In Mudumalai National Park, only three prey types were specified to genera which consisted of black-hooded oriole (&quot;Orolus xanthornus&quot;), common bronzeback snake (&quot;Dendrelaphis tristis&quot;) and an unidentified giant squirrel. Not all nests have relatively small prey, as one nest in northern India showed a prey composition of red junglefowl (&quot;Gallus gallus&quot;), large woodpeckers such as flamebacks and larger parakeets. Alongside various junglefowl and the domestic chicken derived from them, virtually any gamebird seem to be nearly ideal prey for changeable hawk-eagles and several species, including peafowl, bush quail, spurfowl and francolins, are known to be hunted, including both young and adults. Many other birds with partial terrestrial habits seem to be taken quite widely including various pigeons and doves, rails and other water birds.

The upper size limit for changeable hawk-eagle prey seems to be fairly liquid and the species is quite the equal of various other booted eagles in making bold attacks on prey of their own size or larger. Many of the mammals reported as preyed upon by changeable hawk-eagles are quite large. Mammalian prey taken as adults has included hispid hares (&quot;Lepus hispidus&quot;) with a median estimated weight of , Indian hare (&quot;Lepus nigricollis&quot;) with a median mass of , Indian flying fox (&quot;Pteropus giganteus&quot;) and nearly any species of giant squirrel, which can vary in weight between . Even more impressive accounts and photos show that changeable hawk-eagle can hunt and kill adult mammals with formidable defenses such as felids and primates, although it cannot be ruled out that they will usually attack infirm or injured specimens rather than healthy ones. Furthermore, most accounts of attacks on Old World monkeys show juveniles are by far the most vulnerable members of their troops to hawk-eagle attacks. Cases of either verified, likely or potential predation have been reported on northern pig-tailed macaque (&quot;Macaca leonina&quot;), crab-eating macaque (&quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;), toque macaque (&quot;Macaca sinica&quot;) and lion-tailed macaque (&quot;Macaca silenus&quot;), including specimens potentially to weigh up to an estimated . A case of predation was photographed by a changeable hawk-eagle on an estimated juvenile banded langur (&quot;Presbytis femoralis&quot;) while possible cases have been reported of predation on juveniles of other langurs as well as additional larger primates such as gibbons and proboscis monkeys (&quot;Nasalis larvatus&quot;). While their predator-prey relationship is even more nebulous, the peculiar, smaller but toxic nocturnal primates known as slow lorises are known to fall prey as well to changeable hawk-eagles. There are several accounts of predation by changeable hawk-eagles on domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), though largely kittens, in addition to a case of a large adult jungle cat (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;), with an estimated median weight of , being attacked and killed by one of these hawk-eagles. Apparently, the changeable hawk-eagle is also counted among the predators of calves of Indian gazelles (&quot;Gazella bennetti&quot;). Adults of large monitor lizards of a few species may be also included in their prey spectrum. Avian kills include adult Indian peafowl (&quot;Pavo cristatus&quot;), of an estimated weight of up to , and the species is considered a threat as well to the similar green peafowl (&quot;Pavo muticus&quot;). Attempted predation on both adult and young giant ibis (&quot;Thaumatibis gigantea&quot;) have been recorded but all known attacks were unsuccessful. Cases of scavenging on carcasses of various deer and monkey have been reported as well, in one case a hawk-eagle was filmed chasing an adult yellow-throated marten (&quot;Martes flavigula&quot;) from a carcass. Changeable hawk-eagles were also observing preying on predating on Oriental pied hornbills (&quot;Anthracoceros albirostris&quot;).

===Food and feeding===
The habitat selection and overall distribution of the changeable hawk-eagle is largely concurrent with other largish raptors such as the crested serpent eagle and the crested honey buzzard, apparently the three species are largely tolerant and non-aggressive towards each other, perhaps surprisingly given the otherwise aggressive habits of hawk-eagles. Unsurprisingly, these species have quite discrepant ecological niches, especially in terms of their dietary habits. Although nest predators are probably profuse, parent changeable hawk-eagles are likely to aggressive displace most potential threats. No verified accounts of predation are known in the wild and the species often likely fulfills the role of an apex predator. They are presumably able to persist alongside larger cousins such as mountain hawk-eagles and with Legge&#x27;s hawk-eagle by focusing more so on reptiles and birds rather than the mammalian prey likely preferred by the larger species (as well as perhaps focusing primarily on a smaller class of prey), although it is somewhat more adaptable in habitat than both other species. They are also found living alongside the much larger Philippine eagle (&quot;Pithecophaga jefferyi&quot;) and are likely to similarly take smaller prey and avoid direct encounters with the much less numerous giant eagle. In turn, changeable hawk-eagles are likely avoided in encounters with smaller forest raptors such as other, smaller &quot;Nisaetus&quot; species, which often focus slightly less on birds than the changeable, and &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks, which all subsist largely on rather smaller classes of prey. Apparently, changeable hawk-eagle are considered likely predators (on fledglings?) of the slightly smaller Indian spotted eagles (&quot;Clanga hastata&quot;). However, on the contrary, one case of predation was reported in captivity when a barred eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo sumatranus&quot;), which is found in the wild with changeable hawk-eagles in southeast Asia, killed a changeable hawk-eagle in an aviary.

===Breeding===
The changeable hawk-eagle is, like many raptorial birds, a largely solitary bird otherwise but during breeding, stays in a dedicated pairs that often mate for life. Each pair engages in a territorial display over the fringes of their home range. This aerial display is usually engaged in by a male but sometimes the female or both members of the pair will engage in displays, often starting with their wings and tail arched upwards in exaggerated poises. During the display, the shoot up vertically and nose-diving or stooping, if the rival hawk-eagle continues to engage the defending individual, they will fly at each other at &quot;lightening speed&quot; doing a complete loop-the-loop turn in air. They often call loudly throughout the display. The breeding season of changeable hawk-eagles falls from November to May in southern India, peaking January–March, while it is more confined to January–April in the more temperate climate of the Himalayan foothills. The breeding season from India is comparable in Sri Lanka but is slightly more prolonged in the latter country, continuing at times into June. However, peak laying dates fall earlier, around January–February, in Sri Lanka. In the equatorial Greater Sunda islands, eggs have been recorded in 8 different months at any time from December to October with peak activity falling usually between February and August. Apparently, the highest volume of eggs laid here fall in two separate periods, February–March and July–August. Thus, the breeding season is more elastic in tropical forests areas but in northern part of range the breeding season centers around the cooler dry season. This species builds a largish stick nest. Typical dimensions of their nest is across while nest depth can range from the latter after repeated uses and additions. Some nests are very large relative to the size of these eagles. One nest reached an diameter on the inside of and a circumference of . Active nests are lined with green leaves. Both members of the pair participate in building new nests and take part in repairs. Nests are often solidly built and resilient, more so than those of other medium-sized eagles, against high winds and monsoons. Nest height is often from in the crown or high fork of a large tree, but is usually not less than off the ground. Nest height in the Indian subcontinent was typically around , averaging in the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary and in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, and could be in a wide diversity of trees. Nesting sites are often near a stream, or otherwise perhaps near a ravine with wide view but sometimes varies from deep forest to isolated trees on village edges. In the peri-urban green spaces of Singapore, changeable hawk-eagles nested mostly on &quot;Albizia&quot; trees, which are among the fastest-growing and tallest trees in these secondary forests. The parents tend to allow closer approach by humans when living in vicinity of villages.

Only one egg is known to be laid by changeable hawk-eagles. The egg tends to be coarse and glossless, largely white but sparely and faintly speckled or blotched with light reddish. Egg sizes were reportedly measured in the nominate subspecies (sample of 40) as ranging from in height with an average of by a diameter of with an average of . In the race &quot;N. c. ceylanensis&quot;, a sample of 24 eggs averaged . In &quot;N. c. limnaeetus&quot; from northern India, 18 eggs averaged . In the same subspecies, eggs from Java and Borneo ranged from in height and from in diameter. In the race &quot;N. c. andamanensis&quot;, the average was reportedly but the sample size is unknown. Apparently, the female alone incubates, for a period estimated at 40 days. After the nestling hatches, the female will brood intensively for about 25 days. An Indian nestling was found to weigh at 14 days and grew to by 20 days, having developed a vocabulary of &quot;cheep&quot; notes to express hunger and alarm. The eaglet may be preening, standing more and wing flapping by 4 to 5 weeks old, and may also be encouraged to eat at by its mother, however consuming a single food item may take up to 6 hours at this point. At 35 days, the nestling may be brooded progressively less and feather and body size growth accelerates. Within a couple of weeks, prey is delivered (often by both parents at this stage) to nearby branches rather than directly to the nest with the parents calling as they approach, apparently encouraging the young eaglet to venture out of the nest. By 52 days of age, the eaglet is fully-grown but does not fledge until about 60–68 days. The total nest dependency was recorded as 81 days in India. However, the total breeding cycle was recorded as lasting about 112 days in West Java.

==Status==

The changeable hawk-eagle apparently ranges over 13 million square kilometers across its range. An average of only 1 pair to every of its distribution would put the population well into five figures but their density is likely rather higher. This species is an exceptionally adaptable one not only by the standards of its genus but also by the standards of its subfamily. While deforestation has depleted the populations of their fellow &quot;Nisaetus&quot; species, resulting in four being classified as Endangered species, the changeable hawk-eagle has been shown to be remarkably resilient in the face of cutting and habitat degradation. This trend, holding steady in population or even increasing while other hawk-eagle species have declined, has been reported in the Indian subcontinent, Malaysia, Java and the Philippines as well as elsewhere in southeast Asia. In Java, the changeable hawk-eagle was found to persist in all seven habitat types available on the islands, whereas the Javan hawk-eagle was confined to only four habitat types: the deeper, primary forested areas. However, their adaptability can be overstated and this species requires tall trees (though secondary growth forest is acceptable), appropriate habitat composition and ample prey populations to flourish. It is likely they can persist in most variety of high grade forestry and urbanization but complete deforestation is the only major threat to this species. A more secondary concern, but potentially depleting populations in India at least, is that it will not infrequently hunt chickens (especially during breeding when such easy prey is hard to resist), which has in turn resulted in changeable hawk-eagles being locally persecuted.

<text>Pisz ( , previously also &quot;Jańsbork&quot;, ; Masurian: Jánsbork) is a historic town in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship in northern Poland, with a population of 19,466 (2016). It is the seat of Pisz County. Pisz is situated at the junction of Lake Roś and the Pisa River, in the region of Masuria.

== Etymology ==
The name Pisz originates from the word &quot;pisa&quot;, meaning &quot;swamp&quot; in the ancient Prussian language, owing to the muddy water from nearby Lake Roś. Johannisburg received the name of the castle in 1645, when it became a city by the decree of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. Historic Polish names were &quot;Jańsbork&quot; and &quot;Pisz&quot;, and the former was replaced by the latter as official in 1946.

==History==

The site of today&#x27;s Pisz was originally inhabited by the indigenous ethnic group of Old Prussians. In 1345 the Teutonic Order began constructing a castle nearby at the southernmost point of the Piska Forest, in the Masurian Lake District. The castle was named &quot;Johannisburg&quot;, after St. John the Baptist. The settlement nearby held a market as early as 1367, but it was not until 1645 that it received its town charter. The town&#x27;s first mayor was Fryderyk Adam Czerniewski. The population of the settlement and its environs was almost entirely Polish since its establishment. The official German name of the town was Johannisburg, while the Polish-speaking residents referred to it as &quot;Jańsbork&quot;. In 1454 it was incorporated to Poland by King Casimir IV Jagiellon and after 1466 it was a part of Poland as a fief. Its early growth owed much to the residents&#x27; skill in beekeeping, and it was located on trade routes leading to Gdańsk and to the Vistula and Narew Rivers.

The town became part of Ducal Prussia in 1525 and remained under Polish suzerainty until 1657. In 1639 Polish King Władysław IV Vasa visited the town. Later on, the town was part of Brandenburg-Prussia, and, after that it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 and Germany in 1871. In 1698, King of Poland Augustus II the Strong and Elector of Brandenburg Frederick I held a meeting in the local castle. Polish King Stanisław Leszczyński stopped in the town in 1709 and 1734 and in 1813 Tsar Alexander I of Russia stayed here.

In 1709/10 only 14 inhabitants survived the plague. The town began to develop extensively in the 19th century. In 1818 it became the seat of the Landkreis Johannisburg in the province of East Prussia. During the January Uprising, weapons were smuggled through the town and area to the Russian Partition of Poland, and Polish insurgents fleeing the Russian Partition took refuge in the town. The Prussians imprisoned and tried Polish insurgents and resistance members in the town. Residents protested against the deportation of insurgents to the Russian Partition. The town&#x27;s population in 1876 was approximately 3,000. A railway built connecting Allenstein (Olsztyn) and Lyck (Ełk) ran through Johannisburg. Its water supply system and gas works were built in 1907 and its municipal slaughterhouse in 1913. The town&#x27;s industrial development focused on wood processing and metallurgy. According to the 1900 Imperial German census, Johannisburg&#x27;s population consisted of 70.2% Poles.

As a result of the treaty of Versailles, the 1920 East Prussian plebiscite was organized under the control of the League of Nations. It was preceded by a campaign of violence and terror by the Germans against the Poles. The Germans attacked the Polish community center, there were beatings of Poles and the Polish press reported preparations being made for a pogrom against Poles, thus it resulted in 2,940 votes to remain in East Prussia, and therefore Germany, and none for Poland.

During World War II, Johannisburg was 70% destroyed by fighting and occupation by the Soviet Red Army. At war&#x27;s end in 1945, it was transferred from German to Polish control according to the Potsdam Agreement and officially renamed &quot;Pisz&quot; in 1946. The name Pisz comes from the Old Prussian word &quot;pisa&quot; (&quot;swamp&quot;), owing to the muddy water from nearby Lake Roś.
After assumption of Polish rule, Germans returned to their home after flight from the Red Army. Those who did not pledge allegiance to Poland were expelled.

==Tourism and sights==
The town is a popular place to begin sailing on the Masurian lakes. Historic sites of Pisz include the Gothic town hall, the Church of St. John, the ruins of the Teutonic Knights&#x27; castle and preserved World War II bunkers.

== Economy ==
Due to natural resources comprising the reach forestry and shallow deposits of bog iron ore, the industrial traditions of Pisz are connected with wood processing (the sawmill) and metallurgy. There are iron works in Wądołek, as well as the industrial smithies in Wiartl and in Jaśkowo. The wood processing industry has a long tradition in Pisz. The core of the industry is its sawmill, supporting a broadbase plywood industry with a plant called Zakłady Przemysłu Sklejek.

Pisz is a centre of tourism industry, with boat trips, canoeing and kayaking along the Krutynia River, as well as with popular yachting voyages on the Masurian Lakes known in Polish as &quot;Kraina Wielkich Jezior&quot;. On the shore of Nidzkie Lake there&#x27;s the K. I. Gałczyński Museum in Leśniczówka Pranie. There is a museum in the 9th century granary displaying historical artifacts and a notable collection of antlers. There are horse and horse-drawn carriage trips. The town is surrounded by the largest forest complex of the Masuria region, known as Puszcza Piska (Piska Primeval Forest) with eleven nature reserves.
