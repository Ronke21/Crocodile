<text>The , also referred to as Evas, are fictional biomechanical humanoid mechas introduced in the anime television series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, produced by Gainax and directed by Hideaki Anno and in the manga of the same name written and illustrated by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. In addition to the original animated series, Evangelions appear in its derivative works, including spin-off manga, video games, visual novels, the original video animation &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School,&quot; and in the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; movies, with considerably different roles and guises.

In the original animated series, the Evangelions are giant humanoids, which the research center Gehirn and the special agency Nerv research to fight beings called Angels. They have mechanical components and a basic organic structure derived from Adam and Lilith; for this reason, they have eyes, epidermis, internal organs, and nails similar to those of humans and have been classified as cyborgs rather than mecha in the traditional sense. Those assigned to pilot an Evangelion are called Children and are selected by an organization called the Marduk Institute. Their designs, inspired by the oni of Japanese folklore, &quot;Ultraman&quot;, &quot;Iczer-One&quot;, &quot;Devilman&quot;, and other sources, caused problems during the production of the animated series but have received a positive reception from critics and audiences and have been used for merchandise.

==Conception==

Hideaki Anno, director and principal screenwriter of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, initially sought to create what he called &quot;a simple work featuring robots&quot;. He began by focusing on vague images and ideas rather than defined concepts, thinking other staff members would contribute by adding details. According to King Records&#x27; Toshimichi Ōtsuki, producer of the series, at the beginning of production, the idea was to create a series about an Ultraman in armor, the franchise of the same name&#x27;s protagonist. The staff took inspiration from an old project by Gainax; for the project, Anno came up with the idea of a female pilot in the wake of the original video animation &quot;Fight! Iczer One&quot;, starting from the image of a girl in a capsule-shaped cockpit full of liquid – prototypes of the Eva-00 pilot Rei Ayanami and the Entry Plug – but without having a precise plot in mind. Other images became the basis of &quot;Evangelion&quot;, such as skyscrapers emerging from the top of mountains, robots carrying batteries, people dragging large cables, and a city in the peaks named Tokyo-2 in Nagano Prefecture.

During production, the staff decided to have teenagers pilot the mechas and follow the tradition of other robot anime. However, Anno did not initially think to give a reason regarding their ages. An explanation came to mind to the character designer of the series, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. While watching a documentary on the Japanese TV station NHK named the artist learned of the existence of A10 nerves. Sadamoto then pitched new ideas for the anime, such as explaining the age of the pilots, who are all teenagers without mothers. Sadamoto tried to create something similar to &quot;Space Pirate Captain Harlock&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot;, a spaceship with a computer that contains the soul of its creator, Tochirō Ōyama. Anno compared the interface system of the Eva to a modern version of Gō Nagai&#x27;s Mazinger, a giant robot whose cockpit is located in the head of the robot. The staff thus conceived the Evas as custodians of the soul of the pilot&#x27;s mother, controlled through a psychic link with her son. Sadamoto also compared the Nerv with the Solo Ship from &quot;Space Runaway Ideon&quot;, whose crew faces hostile aliens of the Buff Clan and other humans, with mecha that go out of control and communicate only with children.

In a preliminary draft during the early planning stages of the animated series, staff suggested the existence of two ancient prehistoric civilizations that appeared on Earth before humans, both of whom were equipped with advanced technologies. The Evangelions in the original scenario would have been created by the first civilization, known as the First Ancestral Race, and would have rebelled against their creators, causing their extinction. The Second Ancestral Race would have created a weapon known as the Longinus Spear in an attempt to defeat the humanoids, scattering warriors named Angels in a state of hibernation around the globe as a countermeasure in case anyone tried to reactivate the Evangelions. The Eva units were conceived from the beginning as living beings and dangerous androids rather than simple weapons; the scenario was designed to contain elements similar to those in video games or role-playing games, such as the units&#x27; weapons being hidden in the buildings of Tokyo-3. In the last episodes, there should have been a lunar battle against twelve Angels, an idea that was later abandoned and recycled for the clash between Eva-02 and the Eva series, introduced in the 1997 theatrical conclusion. The American continent and the Eva-06 would vanish, while the ancient remains of a ruin named Arqa would be revealed.

In the second half of the story, there would be preparations to invade an enemy stronghold along the lines of a role-playing game. One of the preliminary drafts of the twenty-fourth episode, written by screenwriter Akio Satsukawa, also introduced a prototype mini Evangelion, a five-meter mecha named αーTYPEーEVA000, also known as α Eva. When the α Eva goes berserk, it would have attacked the Angel Kaworu Nagisa with animal fury, who would have dodged his blows in a scene inspired by the legend of the samurai Benkei on the Gojo Bridge; at the end of the fight, the Evangelion would have swallowed the Angel Tabris and Rei Ayanami, to be then violently disemboweled by the Prog-Knife of Shinji Ikari&#x27;s Eva-01. In another proposal, there were two units called 05 and 06, manufactured in Germany, while the Evangelion after 01 would be equipped with a power system known as a positron engine.

Two years before airing, Gainax published a project presentation document to find backers entitled , which included the initial unit designs. In the &quot;Proposal,&quot; the Evangelion were described as humanoids made of artificial metal muscles and replicas of Adam, indicated in the document as an artificial giant left by the First Ancestral Race, which would have left the enemies of the series, the &quot;Apostolos&quot;, for the globe. The document also describes robotic anime on one page as a &quot;compensation for the complexes and various suppressions that children hold, a means of resistance, compensatory behavior&quot;.

For the main character of the series, Shinji, Anno himself was used as a model, linking the act of piloting the mecha with his work; according to Kazuya Tsurumaki, assistant director of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, while &quot;Shinji was summoned by his father to ride a robot, Anno was summoned by Gainax to direct an animation&quot;. Moreover, during the development of the series, the director included scenes in which the mecha are mutilated and lose their limbs. The mutilations of the Evas became a product of his personal experience. Anno&#x27;s father, Takuyo, injured his left leg in an accident with a power saw and was forced to wear a prosthesis for life; following the accident, Hideaki developed a certain attraction to deformity, believing that he could not love &quot;anything perfect&quot;. He also compared this to &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot;, where a robot loses an arm. In the twentieth episode of the series, he also introduced the concept of cannibalism. He added a scene in which Eva-01 devours an Angel in an attempt to disgust and scare a young viewer; he stated, &quot;What would be ideal is that kids who watch it start to vomit&quot;. Cannibalism, according to Yūichirō Oguro, curator of extra contents of &quot;Evangelion&quot;&#x27;s home video editions, would negatively depict the act of eating meat and could also be influenced by Anno&#x27;s personal experience, who has been vegetarian since childhood and had already transposed this detail of his life in his fictional works.

===Design and inspirations===
The design of the Evangelion was conceived and edited by Anno and Ikuto Yamashita, the official mecha designer of the series. The director took inspiration from the demons of Japanese folklore, the &quot;oni&quot;, and wanted to give them a modern look that differed from other mecha, such as the Gundams of the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; series, giving them a more human-demonic nature than strictly robotic. He commissioned Yamashita to create &quot;a demon&quot;, &quot;a giant barely under the control of humankind&quot;. Yamashita thus drew inspiration for the design of the machines from &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, with the idea of representing an enormous power restrained, a giant that resembled a relief in a wall.Since the delivery of the preparatory sketches, Yamashita&#x27;s drawings caused such a stir that even &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;&#x27;s staff members were divided, causing problems for Gainax. Toshimichi Ōtsuki introduced &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; to a well-known toy company, but a representative of the company told him that a robot with such a design could never sell, especially because the lower limbs were considered too skinny. Anno, after the episode, decided to create a different series compared to the other mecha anime, all financed by private toy companies; moreover, to avoid any possible interference from the financial backers, he designed mecha that were difficult to reproduce in toy form to have more artistic freedom and revolutionize the genre, which he said had been stagnant for a long time and caged in a ready-made model.

For the appearance and role of the humanoids, the authors took inspiration from &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, &quot;Shutendoji&quot;, and &quot;Devilman&quot;. Believing that the power was &quot;something very scary&quot;, Anno insisted on the threatening aspect of the units, trying to make the Evangelion look like &quot;an anti-hero, something terrifying&quot;. Before deciding on the final design he drew a preliminary draft of the Eva similar to a Devilman. In the sketch the Eva had a curved back, a narrow waist, and a flat, thick chest, which resembled the &quot;demonic&quot; face of the Mazinger. In his original proposal, the Evangelion would have had a dark and gloomy color, except for the eyes, which he left white and circled in red, just like Mazinger Z. The intention was to inspire terror and make children understand how scary real life could be.

Another source of inspiration was a male character in the video game &quot;Cho Aniki&quot; named El&amp;Topo, on which Yamashita based Eva-02&#x27;s appearance. In the design stages, he changed his mind about their appearance several times; for example, in preliminary sketches, he thought about giving 01 a single oblique protrusion on the left side of the head or two frontal horns, which were later abandoned in favor of the final design. Anno and animator Yoh Yoshinari also made some sketches of the Eva-01. Yoshinari tried to animate the units using rulers, as in the case of the second episode, in which he tried to draw almost the entire face and shoulders of 01 in such a way. Sadamoto at first colored it white, creating an image he said was similar to an RX-78 Gundam or an Ingram from &quot;Patlabor&quot;. While working on the Evas&#x27; design, he also worked on a project called &quot;Suzuka Hachitai&quot;, in which he designed suits similar to the Evangelions&#x27; plugsuits.

For the movements, the director asked to recreate &quot;the noise that the bundles of wires would make if they were contracting like muscles&quot;, treating them as if they were living beings. For this reason, all the sounds normally used in other mecha anime were avoided; for example, to reproduce the sound of the Prog-Knife, Anno and Toru Noguchi, the sound effects editor, reworked the metallic noise of a real cutter. To give the Eva&#x27;s cockpit the image of a mother&#x27;s womb, Anno asked Shiro Sagisu, who was responsible for the series&#x27; soundtrack, to compose a melody that would accentuate the feeling of nostalgia.

==Characteristics==
In the world of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, Evangelions, or Evas, are multi-purpose machines that represent mankind&#x27;s most advanced battle tools. They are costly weapons designed to fight and destroy Angels. Their development, which the special agency Nerv conducts in secret, began after a catastrophe known as the Second Impact. From a scientific point of view, this tasks constitute the E project, placed under the direction and responsibility of Dr. Ritsuko Akagi. The Evangelion are giant humanoids clad in thick protective armor, with constitution identical to a human being&#x27;s, except for size. Each Evangelion is equipped with a nervous system, a skeleton, nails and a circulatory system. In a section of Nerv&#x27;s headquarters called Terminal Dogma, there are skeletons of bodies believed to be precursors to the Eva-00, or the remains of failed experiments that occurred during its creation; the experimental models have two or more optical sensors and a visible spine. The original living bodies are implanted with mechanical components and a constrictive coverage, which are used to control them or provide them with greater efficiency and functionality. As in humans, the signals of the central nervous system are transmitted by electrical impulses, with the peripheral system and the movements of an Evangelion being transmitted by electric currents. For the first three examples, designed in Japan, the traditional Chinese numbering system is adopted, while later prototypes follow Arabic numbering.

The Evas have regenerative capabilities and can produce a protective shield called an AT Field. They can move through the power provided by an external cable called an Umbilical Cable, which gives them the electrical energy needed to operate their circuits. In the absence of the cable, they can operate using the energy stored in a special internal battery, for a time limit ranging from sixty seconds to five minutes. When inactive, the units are housed in giant structures called &quot;cages&quot; and held in place by an anchoring structure, composed of various blocks and groups of safeties. Another characteristic element of the Angels and Evangelions is a red sphere called a core, located at their chest.

The units have different equipment that varies depending on the situation. The basic one is called type B (Basic), consisting only of a cutter-like weapon called a Progressive Knife. Other assets include type D (Dive), specifically for diving; and type F (Fly) for flight. The Evangelion&#x27;s piloting system synchronizes with its pilot via neural connection, and so they act in sync. The pilot of an Evangelion unit, designated by the English term Child, is housed in a cylindrical capsule called an Entry Plug, which is inserted into the area corresponding to the humanoid&#x27;s spine, at the cervical vertebrae.

The cockpit of the Entry Plug is filled with a special liquid called LCL, which promotes the neural connection between the Evangelion and its pilot. The main nerve responsible for synchronizing the two entities is called the A10 nerve. It seems that the subjects suitable to pilot an Evangelion are limited to 14-year-old children without a mother, and that Evangelions, originally devoid of a soul, have the souls of people. It is also believed that the souls of the mothers of their respective pilots are housed in the mechas. Once the neural connection is successfully established, the Children can command the humanoid at will, thinking that they are acting with their own body, through a system known as neural interface. However, its maintenance can be jeopardized if it is damaged during an operation, which causes corresponding psychological disorders in the pilot. Moreover, a state commonly referred to as berserk is possible, during which an Evangelion enters an uncontrollable and seemingly instinctual destructive rage. According to the &quot;Evangelion Chronicle&quot; magazine, the aggressiveness of the berserk can be due to the fact that Eva-01 is a clone of the Angel Lilith, while the Angels are descended from Adam. Their height is never specified in the series, though &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine provided an estimate of forty meters. According to Hiroyuki Yamaga, a member of Gainax, it was decided during production to make the units taller than Ultraman, who is forty-five meters tall. In the &quot;Proposal,&quot; their height is also determined forty meters, while in the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga their height is explicitly around seventy meters, eighty with vertical supports.

==Original series==
===Evangelion Unit-00===
, also known as Prototype, is the first Evangelion unit that Nerv made. It was conceived as a machine dedicated not to combat, but to the study of feasibility and practical functionality of its basic technology, which is why it lacks equipment characteristic of subsequent units. It was conceived in the headquarters of Tokyo-3, and the biological starting material used for its creation belongs to the first Angel, Adam. It is distinguished from later models by its initial dark yellow coloration, typical of military prototypes, and a less sophisticated external and internal architecture. Its main organ of visual sensory perception is represented by a round optical lens at the center of its face. Its pilot is Rei Ayanami, who joins the organization as the First Child. Due to its function as a prototype, the unit suffers from instability, which causes it to act out of control in activation and synchronization experiments. In one of the experiments, it destroyed the anchor structures and Nerv&#x27;s second experimental room, injuring its pilot. Its first effective activation occurs after the simultaneous presence of two Evangelion units is necessary during the Angel Ramiel&#x27;s attack. In the course of the operation, it suffers structural damage so severe that it requires extensive repairs.

Eva-00 is later used in the fight against the Angel Matarael after being repaired. The repairs to Eva-00 mainly concern its armor and equipment, while its internal structure is essentially unchanged. The repaired Eva-00 has a predominantly blue coloration and is equipped with vertical supports resembling those fitted to Eva-01 and 02. It also has shoulder-height vertical supports, which are equipped with a special propulsion system allowing it to slow down and cushion falls. Its presence is beneficial to the defense of Tokyo-3 and the elimination of Angels. It is destroyed during the fight against the sixteenth Angel, Armisael, after Rei activates the self-destruct mechanism.

In the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga, Eva-00 is orange in color and wields a special shield called the Enhanced Shield of Virtue, which Yamashita designed. In the second chapter of the saga, &quot;&quot; (2009), the tenth Angel swallows it.

===Evangelion Unit-01===
, or Test Type, is the experimental model of the Evangelion series and the second specimen to be built in the Nerv headquarters, studied under the direct supervision of Dr. Yui Ikari. It differs from all previous and subsequent specimens, as the biological matter that forms its basis comes from the second Angel, Lilith. In addition to its predominantly purple coloration, it is characterized by a long horn that extends from the center of the forehead and a binocular viewer. It is the first humanoid to be used in an actual war operation. The unit acts out of control on several occasions and takes on a decisive role in wartime operations. The living humanoid at the base of Unit-01 is characterized by brown-colored organic tissues and a red blood-like body fluid. The unit&#x27;s mouth is normally secured with bolts, and its actual biological body is covered, like the other units, by a special constrictive armor. The unit has positive operational results and the greatest tactical experience out of all the units that Nerv produced.

The first activation experiment of Unit-01 was carried out in 2004 in the Laboratory for Artificial Evolution and conducted by a research center called Gehirn. Yui was designated as the experiment&#x27;s test subject; during the experiment, her synchrony rate reached 400%, a percentage at which the subject dissolves into the Evangelion. The case was dismissed as an accident, and her soul remained within the unit. Although the origin of the accident is never clarified within the series, it may have been the consequence of Yui&#x27;s choice. The second activation attempt occurs eleven years later in 2015, when the Third Child and its new pilot, Shinji Ikari, is brought aboard. Shinji, despite the low probability of success and lack of training, manages to achieve a 41.3% sync rate on the first attempt. The success of the procedure might have been determined by Yui&#x27;s will, who in some situations intervenes in defense of her son and moves the Eva of her own will.

In the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; installments, Eva-01 has some aesthetic differences, particularly in the chest and coloring. During the battle against the tenth Angel, the color of its stripes changes from green to orange and it sports a halo of light.

===Evangelion Unit-02===
, or Production Model, is the first Evangelion specimen researched and designed for mass production and combat. Although the conception and construction of the machine took place in Japan, the assembly and activation experiments, as well as the training of its pilot, the Second Child Asuka Langley Soryu, are performed in Germany. The biological material used for its creation belongs to Adam. Dr. Kyōko Zeppelin Sōryū, a member of Gehirn&#x27;s German section, played a decisive role in the unit&#x27;s development and activation. She offered herself as a guinea pig in a contact experiment with the Evangelion, from which she emerged psychologically distraught after a mental contamination. It is speculated that a part of her soul, or her &quot;maternal side&quot;, remained locked inside 02. In contrast to the first two units, it has four eyes, a feature that is abandoned in later models. Additional features that distinguish 02 from other units are its internal fluids being blue instead of red and having additional mechanical details.

On the shoulders, it has two vertical supports that differ from the Eva-01. The left contains an improved version of the Progressive Knife, while the right contains the Needle Gun, a firearm capable of firing spikes. The unit is predominantly red and differs from previous units in the conformation of the head, shoulder, and chest components. Two of its main features are the ability to bend its torso and a greater resemblance to a human being, while there are no substantial differences in its performance compared to Eva-01. In 2015, Asuka and 02 left Wilhelmshaven for Tokyo-3, along with the United Nations fleet. During the transport, Eva-02&#x27;s first real battle took place in the Pacific Ocean, in which it managed to defeat the Angel Gaghiel. Starting from the fight against the thirteenth Angel, Bardiel, the unit starts to record failures in the operations, hurting Asuka&#x27;s pride. Following Asuka&#x27;s mental breakdown, Nerv is forced to request the help of a new Child, Kaworu Nagisa, who becomes its new pilot.

In the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; movies, Eva-02 has a different design. During the production, the staff decided to change the unit&#x27;s head, giving it two small horn-like protrusions located on top of the forehead, designed by Takeshi Honda. Throughout the film, Eva-02 is piloted by Mari Makinami, who activates a new mode called The Beast. After activating The Beast Mode, the Eva becomes quadrupedal and unleashes sticks on its shoulders and back and has a jaw with sharp fangs and a green light emitting from its eyes.

===Evangelion Unit-03===
 is a mass-production model built at Nerv&#x27;s U.S. first division. Due to an accident that occurred at the second division with Eva-04, command over 03 passed to Japan as instructed by the U.S. government. Following the government&#x27;s decision, the unit is airlifted over the Pacific Ocean to the organization&#x27;s headquarters. The 03 is almost identical in appearance to the Eva-02, except it is predominantly dark blue, and the shape of its head is closer to Unit 01&#x27;s. 03&#x27;s face has more brutal features and lacks the characteristic frontal bulge of the Eva-01. Additional details that distinguish it from the other units are its elongated shoulders, slightly forward-leaning posture, and gait. Once it arrives in Japan, preparations begin for its activation experiment to take place in the city of Matsushiro, Nagano Prefecture, where Nerv&#x27;s second experimentation site is located. Once its designated pilot, the Fourth Child Toji Suzuhara, boards, the unit goes out of control, opens its jaws, and destroys the fences containing it. It is later revealed that the unit is infected by Bardiel, a parasitic Angel that takes control of its body during its flight to Japan headquarters. After the incident, Gendo Ikari, the supreme commander of Nerv, identifies it as the thirteenth Angel and gives the order to annihilate it. Eva-03 faces Units 00 and 02 in combat, defeating them without difficulty. In a second encounter, it fights with Eva-01, who breaks its limbs and annihilates it. In the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; saga, Eva-03 is piloted by Asuka instead of Suzuhara.

===Evangelion Unit-04===
 is a Mass-Production Model built in the United States at the American Nerv Second Division, located in Nevada. Due to an accident that occurred during a test of experimental insertion of the S2 engine, the unit disappears with the second division and all objects within a radius of 89 kilometers in a Dirac sea. Its appearance is never shown in the original animated series, but is believed to be silver-white. Official action figures have been produced of the unit, designed and conceived by Yamashita. Its basic appearance is identical to Unit 03 but it has a silver colour.

===Mass Production Units (05-13)===
The includes units 05 through 13, built at various Nerv branches at the behest of the Seele organization to carry out a plan known as the Human Instrumentality Project. All units are equipped with S2 engines as their power source and a replica of the Lance of Longinus. Their basic structure is identical to the Nerv-owned Evas, except for the vertical supports normally placed on the shoulders of the other units. Another different element is the head, which is devoid of optical sensors, and the area in which the cockpit is inserted. Due to the S2 element, the units also have strong regenerative capabilities and unlimited uptime. All nine Eva Series possess the same shape and coloring, mostly white, and large folding wings located on the back of the trunk, which allow them to fly. These Production Models do not require pilots; instead they have a Dummy Plug, Entry Plug simulators in which the personality of the Fifth Children, Kaworu Nagisa, is inscribed.

In the movie &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, Seele sends all nine Evangelions against Eva-02. The Evas, despite suffering extensive damage from Unit-02 during the fight and being seemingly defeated, managed to reactivate through the S2 engine, scarring the enemy&#x27;s body and devouring its flesh. During the Human Instrumentality Project, the Mass Production Models merge with the Angel Lilith and stab themselves with their lances. At the end of the feature film, once Instrumentality is rejected by Shinji and Lilith is dismembered, the units turn into stone statues and plummet to Earth. Their design by Takeshi Honda is reminiscent of features commonly associated with angels from the Old Testament.

==&quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot;==
During the production of the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; installments, Yamashita made changes to the armaments and the colors of Eva-00 and the other Evangelions, based on his old sketches for the original series. In the saga, an international agreement called the Vatican Treaty is also mentioned, which forbids a nation from having more than three Eva units. Throughout the films, in addition to the various units already present in the classic series, other Evangelion units are introduced:
*, whose full name is , is a unit that appeares in &quot;Evangelion 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance&quot;. It was designed by Yamashita and underwent changes during the production of the film. Unlike the other Evangelions, its walking is not done through two lower limbs, but utilizing a special wheeled system, and it has a spear-shaped arm. The components of the unit were made in computer graphics, except for the close-ups of the head, to avoid errors in movements. In combat it faces the third Angel of the &quot;Rebuild&quot;, giving signs of a berserk state; both the Eva and the Angel, at the end of the battle, come out destroyed, annihilating each other.
*The , known as , is an Evangelion unit featured in the film &quot;Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance&quot;. It is built on the Moon base Tabgha, placed under the control of the Seele. During the film, it descends from the Moon and is piloted by Kaworu, sporting a halo of light similar to that of 01.
*The Mark.07 is an Evangelion unit that appears in &quot;&quot;. It has beige-colored armor, dark-colored vertical supports, and a head similar to a humanoid skull. During the film, Asuka&#x27;s Eva-02 and Mari&#x27;s Eva-08 clash against an army of hundreds of Mark.07s at the epicenter of Second Impact in Antarctica. During the production, Yamashita sketched the units with a different color scheme.
* is an Evangelion unit introduced in the preview of &quot;Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo&quot; featured at the end of the credits of &quot;Evangelion 2.0&quot;. Throughout the film, it is piloted by Mari Illustrious Makinami; it has eight optical sensors. It is predominantly pink, with small inserts of yellow and green. Its full official nomenclature is .
* is an Evangelion unit introduced in the brief preview of &quot;&quot; present at the end of the &quot;Evangelion 3.0&quot; film. Its armor is half red and half pink. This specimen is believed to be the result of a fusion between two previous units, 02 and 08. It does not appear in the film.
*The Mark.09 is an Evangelion unit introduced in &quot;Evangelion 3.0&quot;. Its armor is predominantly yellow, with small white inserts. Throughout the film, its color scheme changes to black and red. It is piloted by Rei Ayanami and is known by the epithet &quot;Adams&#x27; Vessel&quot;.
*The is a black, red, and white Evangelion unit that appeares in &quot;3.0+1.0&quot;. In the course of the film it attacks Mari&#x27;s Unit 08, which devours its head in the clash. The unit was unveiled by Anno at the 2020 Bonbori Matsuri festival on August 6, 2020.
*The Mark.11 is an Evangelion that appears in &quot;3.0+1.0&quot;. It is devoured by Mari&#x27;s 08 during the overlapping of its own Eva. The unit is black, blue and white.
*The Mark.12 appeares in &quot;3.0+1.0&quot;. The unit is mostly black and white, and is devoured by Mari&#x27;s Eva-08.
* is a unit that appears in the &quot;Evangelion 3.0&quot; film. Its armor is predominantly purple. It has four eyes and four upper limbs. It is piloted by Shinji Ikari and Kaworu Nagisa and can be activated through two Entry Plugs. Since it cannot generate an AT Field, it is equipped with four drones called RS Hoppers.
*The is an Eva presented in an anti-universe by Gendo to Shinji; Shinji&#x27;s consciousness sees it in the form of a black crucified Lilith, who during Instrumentality breaks free and transforms into a giant Rei Ayanami. Commander Ikari tries to unleash the Additional Impact in this way to carry out the deicide, replace the Angels and transform everyone into Evangelion, rewriting reality and the consciences of humanity.

The Eva units used by Gendo in &quot;Evangelion 3.0+1.0&quot; have been compared by the website Otaku Voice to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. &quot;Rebuild&quot; also features a mechanical simulator of Evangelion, used by Shinji during a training in the first chapter; its design was compared by Shinji Higuchi of Gainax to the God Warrior of &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1984) and to the movements of the Destroid Monster, a machine from &quot;Superdimensional Fortress Macross&quot;.

==Other media==
New units are introduced in video games based on &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. In &quot;Meitantei Evangelion&quot;, published in 2007 for PlayStation 2, there is an Evangelion unit called that is piloted by Kaworu. It also appears in the video game &quot;Shin Seiki Evangelion – Battle Orchestra&quot;, in which another Evangelion called is introduced, built at Seele&#x27;s request. In the &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion 2&quot; video game, the Eva-01 has new equipment, called . It includes the , a special constricting cover that uses new technology for AT Field use; included in the armor is an and a . The equipment also includes a special anti-phase weapon called and the Progressive Dagger. Despite its great attack and defense power, the Type-F equipment weighs thrice than the standard armor, is difficult to maneuver and suffers from instability.

In the spin-off &quot;Petit Eva: Evangelion@School&quot; super-deformed versions of Evangelions are shown: the eldest, , similar to Eva-01, is a schoolmate of Shinji and the other characters at the Nerv municipal academy, and its language is understood only by Shinji and the other units; its brother, , who attends the Angel school; , its younger sister, can speak in human language, is initially mostly yellow and then takes on a blue tint; and , the most anthropomorphic, clumsy, and Asuka-like unit who claims to be German but often uses Japanese mixed with English when speaking. Mari and her Provisional Unit 05 also appear on one cover.

&quot;Rebuild&quot;&#x27;s Provisional Unit 05 was used in a pachinko game titled , released in 2010, while Eva-04 appeared in another pachinko game called . In &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse&quot;, the Eva are not mecha, but individual wieldable weapons used in combat by Shinji and the other characters. They are the manifestations of the deeper inner self of the protagonists; Rei has a spear, Asuka a whip, Kaworu a sword, and Shinji a gun. On February 6, 2015, Studio Khara, producer of the &quot;Rebuild of Evangelion&quot; film tetralogy, released the twelfth short film in the Japan Animator Expo series, &quot;Evangelion: Another Impact (Confidential)&quot;. It introduces an Evangelion unit called Unit Nul, which breaks free during a secret activation test and goes berserk; the purpose and means of its construction are not clear. Its design was handled by Atsushi Takeuchi, who had previously worked for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. A transformable train called 500 &quot;Type Eva&quot;, piloted by Shinji and inspired by the train of the same name dedicated to &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, also appears in an episode of the 2018 anime &quot;Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion&quot;.

===&quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Anima&quot;===

Set three years after the events of the concluding film &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;, the light novel introduces equipment that never appeared in the original animated series. Among other things, Eva-01 features Type-F and CGB equipment, including new vertical supports and a special sensor placed near the horn on its forehead. A new Evangelion mount called is also introduced, which operates via a secure internal N2 technology reactor. Anima also features a further evolution of the Eva-01 called .
*The are yellow and white Evangelions built from the remains of the Eva-00 and Eva Series. The Evangelions are equipped with S2 engines and piloted by different clones of Rei Ayanami: Rei Quatre, Rei Cinq and Rei Six.
*The is an evolution of the Eva-02 from the classic series and is predominantly red. The unit&#x27;s visors and armor are different, given the extensive damage the unit suffered after fighting with the nine serial Eva. The Evangelion is equipped with a special cross-shaped rectenna, located on the back of the torso, which uses microwaves and provides the unit with electricity. Type II is equipped with new mounts that can penetrate Armaros&#x27; AT Field, which include a new Pallet Rifle and Magorox blade. The new 02 is equipped with the UX-1 Allegorica, which gives the unit the ability to fly and stability, through which it can also operate on the regolith of the lunar soil.
*The are new Eva models, similar to the Mass Production Models that appeared in &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; to take down Asuka. Unlike the mass units, they do not have a Super-Solenoid engine, but a new energy engine called QR Signum.
*The is a white-colored Eva, similar to the 02, equipped, like the Carriers, with the QR Signum. Its main weapon is a huge cruciform spear. Its name comes from Heurtebise, the angel present in the works of Jean Cocteau and associated with the image of a bright mirror.
* is a giant Evangelion that appears on the Moon. It is accompanied by a pair of units called , known to the Japanese Nerv as . Its name comes from the fallen angel of the same name in religious tradition who is said to have revealed the secret name of God to humans. Its face, similar to that of the Eva-01, features two horns aligned at forehead height, originally envisioned by Yamashita for the design of the 01.
* is a red-colored hybrid of human and Evangelion, and is the result of Asuka merging with her Evangelion-02 Allegorica following the lunar battle against Armaros. It has the mind of an unconscious small child who is unable to communicate.

==Cultural references and interpretations==
The staff named the mecha after the Greek word ευ-αγγέλιον (&quot;euangelion&quot;), &quot;gospel&quot;, &quot;good news&quot;, shortened to Eva, to allude to Eve. According to &quot;Animerica&quot;, the name would be related to their task as protectors of humanity. Similar to the biblical Eve, born from the rib of the first man Adam, the Evangelions were conceived as copies of the first Angel Adam. Anno said in an interview that he chose it because it sounded &quot;complicated&quot;. On another occasion, he claimed to have chosen the word &quot;good news&quot; as the title of the series because of the belief that it would bring &quot;blessing&quot; and happiness. Yūichirō Oguro, curator of extra content of the home video editions of the series, linked the name to the last scene of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion&quot;, in which there is a sequence in which Yui Ikari, kept inside the Eva-01, blesses her son Shinji by telling him that &quot;any place can be a paradise&quot;.

The units are also linked with other religious references. In a conversation in the twenty-third episode, Seele claims that eight Eva units have been prepared up to that point and that four more remain; according to the series&#x27; filmbooks, the number is a reference to the twelve apostles. In the theme song, &quot;A Cruel Angel&#x27;s Thesis&quot;, Unit 01 is depicted with twelve wings of light, referring to the iconography of Satan and taking a cue from the manga &quot;Devilman&quot;. For the image of the out-of-control Unit 01, which in the nineteenth episode walks on four legs and devours the flesh of an Angel, staff took inspiration from the Buddhist figures of the &quot;preta&quot;. The scene in which Eva-01 is first introduced in the first episode has also been compared to Tadao Nagahama&#x27;s &quot;Combattler V&quot;, while for Carl Gustav Horn, editor of the North American edition of the manga, the Eva units can be &quot;possibly connected to the legend of the Golem, a giant artificial man which does its creator&#x27;s bidding&quot;.

Eva&#x27;s berserk mode has been compared to the berserker warriors, as they entered a state of fury that made them fierce and insensitive to pain. After the fight against Zeruel, Unit 01 acquires mankind&#x27;s fruit of knowledge, science and rationality, and the Angel&#x27;s fruit of life, the S2 engine, becoming a God. An official pamphlet on the series has compared this to the Book of Genesis, which says that whoever eats the two fruits will become like God. In &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; Eva-01 is also inflicted with stigmata, becomes the tree of life and is defined as an ark that can save mankind, in reference to the story of Noah. Moreover, the Umbilical Bridge, the anchoring structure of an Evangelion unit, took inspiration from a technical term used by NASA to define the service structure, or umbilical tower, that connects the Space Shuttle to the launch pad. Eva&#x27;s Umbilical Cable has also been similarly likened to a cable intended to connect the main body of the Space Shuttle to the auxiliary engines, the umbilical cord of the fetus and Emperor Neo from &quot;&quot;, which is powered by a cable that terminates in a similar socket.

The book by Yahata Shoten noted how in Craig Thomas&#x27; &quot;Firefox&quot; the idea of a fighter pilot&#x27;s thought-guided weapon capable of controlling missile launches using brain waves is presented. The same book compared the Eva interface to similar technologies presented in science fiction, such as in William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot;; the LCL, on the other hand, resembles real liquid respiration and a technology featured in James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;The Abyss&quot; (1989), while the Entry Plug is reminiscent of Dr. John C. Lilly&#x27;s flotation tank that inspired Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Altered States&quot;. Japanese architect and academic Tomoko Sakamoto also noted how images similar to those in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) appear in the Entry Plug during the activation of the connection between Eva and pilot.

Eva&#x27;s pilots are called Children. According to writers Kazuhisa Fujie and Martin Foster, the choice of the word may refer to the expression &quot;children of God&quot; mentioned in the New Testament. The term remains in the plural even in the case of a single subject in the Japanese version, which for the filmbooks of the series constitutes a reference to the various clones of Rei Ayanami. According to Gualtiero Cannarsi, the choice to keep the term in the plural is an homage to Tomino&#x27;s &quot;Ideon&quot; series. Critics have noted how mecha-related terms such as Umbilical Cable, Children, the name Eva itself, and LCL, similar to amniotic fluid, are related to motherhood. Others, including Oguro, have associated the cockpit with the image of a womb. Critic Mariana Ortega noted how Asuka in the fourteenth episode compares Eva to a mother&#x27;s womb and breast, and Shinji in the twentieth episode curls up in a fetal position inside the cockpit; according to her, the mother figure in &quot;Evangelion&quot; thus becomes literally and metaphorically cannibalistic.

The , the main synchronization nerve of the Evangelion neural interface system, has been compared by official material to real nerves that are connected to emotions such as anxiety, fear, happiness, and pleasure, and play an important role in relation to the emotional perception of love. The term &quot;nerve&quot; is improper, since it is a simplification used in the operative language of Nerv; the acronym A10 indicates the ventral tegmental area, otherwise called area A10. According to &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; magazine, &quot;when humans fall in love or feel close to their family, the part of the brain labeled A-10 comes into play. Strangely, the pilots of Evas have to use this part of their brains to merge with their Eva. That makes them warriors of love, with the power of love to protect their loved ones&quot;. According to Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, character designer of the series, &quot;the power of love drives this weapon of mass destruction&quot;.

Critics have analyzed Evangelion units, noting how they are organic entities and not machines, and classified them as cyborgs instead of robots. Anno said in 1996 that the Evangelions are not really robots, but giants, describing them as modified humans who move via artificial muscles. During an event in 2021, he also described &quot;Evangelion&quot; as a , surprising Shinji&#x27;s voice actress Megumi Ogata. American writer Susan J. Napier has interpreted the Angels as a representation of the Other and the Evas as a metaphor for the Self that Shinji is called upon to confront in his own personal growth process. Critics and official publications compared the red core in the center of the chest and the limit of operation of the units to Ultraman. Comic Book Resources&#x27;s Timothy Donohoo similarly compared the Evangelions to the Ideon from Yoshiyuki Tomino&#x27;s series of the same name; Donohoo noted how both mecha have a divine nature, seemingly unlimited energy sources, and the ability to read the emotions of their pilots, trying to protect them. Carl Gustav Horn traced influences to &quot;Super Robot 28&quot; and &quot;Giant Robo&quot;. The Entry Plug and Type D equipment, used by Asuka in the tenth episode of the series, have also been juxtaposed with the works of Kenji Yanobe. The Evangelion has been interpreted as a metaphor for the series, produced through emotional efforts by Anno during a difficult time in his life; the constant questions of Shinji, the director&#x27;s alter ego, who continually wonders why to board the Eva-01 and must make himself emotionally independent from the humanoid, have been interpreted as a symbolic representation of the author&#x27;s relationship with his work. In the last two episodes Shinji wonders what the reason is for piloting the Eva. According to Sadamoto, the episodes would not focus on him, but on Anno, the true protagonist of the episodes, while mangaka Kentaro Takekuma interpreted the act of boarding the Eva as a metaphor for the production of an anime.

==Cultural impact==
===Popularity and critical reception===
Yamashita&#x27;s mecha design was praised by John Beam of &quot;Animation Planet&quot; magazine and Martin Theron, a reviewer for the Anime News Network website, who stated, &quot;The mecha designs [presented in &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;] are among the most distinctive ever produced for an anime series, with sleek, lithe appearances that look monstrous, fearsome, and nimble rather than boxy and knight-like.&quot; Comic Book Resources appreciated the Eva-01, which was described as one of the most iconic mechas outside of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. The same website listed the Eva-13 among the top ten mechas of the 2010s. For Hajime Isayama, author of &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, the design of the mechas is &quot;cool in a way unlike anything that came before it&quot;. He particularly praised how Anno directed the animation of the laser beams; according to him, the series is also &quot;jam-packed with the joy of animated expression&quot;. Manga author Katsuhiro Otomo made similar statements.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; praised the mechas and fights, especially those against Israfel, Zeruel, and the Eva Series. According to Erroll Maas, writer for TheGamer, due to the &quot;immense popularity&quot; of the series the Eva-01 became an &quot;internationally recognizable&quot; mecha. In 2010, Yahoo! Japan conducted a survey on &quot;Evangelion&quot; and its eponymous mecha. Fans of the series were asked if they would enjoy building a 1:1 scale model of an Evangelion and which units they would take as a model. In the first question, the answer was almost unanimously in the affirmative; in the second question, Unit 01 was chosen, with 78% of the total votes. A similar result was recorded in 2016, when the website Charapedia asked its users which machine that appeared in a Japanese animation series they wished to use or pilot; the Eva-01 was the second most popular answer, with almost four hundred preferences.

===Merchandise===
According to the writer Kazuhisa Fujie and the Italian researcher Guido Tavassi, at first the toys and the various products on &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; made little money, outclassed by the sales of Rei Ayanami&#x27;s action figures, &quot;and even Bandai was reluctant to market the models of the too unusual and disturbing mecha&quot;. Within a year from the first airing, there was an upsurge of interest in &quot;Evangelion&quot;, and, after some initial hesitation, Bandai launched &quot;at full speed&quot; to produce toys and models of the series. The mecha&#x27;s image was used for consumer goods such as Adidas shoes, wine bottles and snacks, bags, sportswear and access-dateries, sweatshirts, gloves, underwear, children&#x27;s clothes and tamagotchi models. Evangelion units were also used in various video games based on the original animated series, as well as some media detached from the &quot;Evangelion&quot; franchise, such as in the video games &quot;Keri hime sweets&quot;, &quot;Summons Board&quot;, &quot;Puyopuyo!! Quest&quot;, &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, and &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot;.

To celebrate the release of the film &quot;Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone&quot; in 2007, Studio Akiyama put a giant figure of Eva-01 about two meters high at the price of one million yen (about ten thousand U.S. dollars) on sale. In 2010, the formation of a Japanese car team called Evangelion RT-01 apr Corolla for the Super GT championship was announced. At the team&#x27;s first official competition, the group&#x27;s Toyota Corolla Axio was repainted with the Evangelion RT-01&#x27;s color scheme; the two racers, Kōki Saga and Kosuke Matsuura, competed wearing two reproductions of the suit used by Shinji. Over the next two years, the first car was joined by a repainted Porsche 911 GT3 RS emulating the design of Unit 02 and two Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R motorcycles with the features of 01 and 02. In November 2014, the Japanese car company Mitsuoka Motors auctioned off a Mitsuoka Orochi inspired by the Eva-01 design, selling for a final price of 16 million yen (approximately $130,000); the event received enough media attention that the company&#x27;s president, Akio Mitsuoka, entered into an agreement with the car&#x27;s owner to display it at the Mitsuoka Gallery Azabu in Tokyo for an entire week. In 2015, it was announced that a high-speed train inspired by the design of the Eva-01 would be built, with both Yamashita and Anno being involved in its construction. The train went into operation in November; West Japan Railway Company later decided to extend service until spring 2018. A new Eva-01 themed train was produced in 2020 and departed from Nagoya&#x27;s Chubu Centrair International Airport.

====Reproductions====
In 2010, a faithful reproduction of the bust of Eva-01 was unveiled in the Fuji-Q HighLand amusement park, along with a full-scale model of the Entry Plug. Between 2011 and 2015, projects to build a 1:1 scale replica of the Eva-02 boss in The Beast mode, a hotel room inspired by the Unit 00 Entry Plug, and a roller coaster designed and built based on the 01 design were announced. However, due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, work on the 02 statue was postponed indefinitely.

In 2015, a limited-time event dedicated exclusively to &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; was inaugurated at the Expasa service area in Ashigara, Shizuoka Prefecture, where a six-meter-tall statue of Eva-01, the largest in the world, was displayed. In 2016, the record was passed to a giant reproduction of 01 with a to-scale model of Longinus&#x27; spear in his hands, built in Shanghai. The statue was built by Khara, the Heitao Interactive company, and the Shanghai Character License Administrative Corporation. At 24.8 meters high, it entered the Guinness World Records in a special category as &quot;the largest Evangelion in the world&quot;. In 2020, Nagoya promoted an event named Evangelion Chukyo Area Project to celebrate the release of &quot;Evangelion 3.0+1.0&quot;, the last installment of &quot;Rebuild&quot;; a golden statue of Eva-01 was unveiled at Chūbu-Centrair Airport along with a six-meter-high reproduction of the unit at the city&#x27;s Global Gate Complex. To coincide with the release of the feature film, a special &quot;Evangelion&quot;-themed event was held at the Tokyo Sky Tree in 2021, during which the lights of the tower were illuminated in the colors of the &quot;Evangelion&quot; units from the &quot;Rebuild&quot;.

===Legacy===
According to scholar Guido Tavassi, the &quot;revolutionary&quot; mecha design can be counted among the innovations introduced by &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;which, on the one hand, brings the Eva units closer to the human figure, but on the other hand proposes a complete abstraction of the forms of the enemies, the Angels, with a choice that will have an enormous impact on the design of subsequent series of the genre&quot;. Maya Phillips, a writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, credited &quot;Evangelion&quot; with redefining the mecha genre and the relationship between pilot and fighting machine. The Evas, according to Phillips, introduce more ambiguity compared to the mecha of the past, being difficult to classify and halfway between Nagai&#x27;s super robots and Gundam-like real robots; according to the writer, the anime, although indebted to the past series, &quot;was perhaps the first to imagine the human &quot;as&quot; machine, and vice versa&quot;. The new element for Phillips is the frightening and dangerous nature of the humanoids, unknown until then to mainstream anime.

Eva-01&#x27;s design inspired Nobuhiro Watsuki for the appearance of the giant Fuji, one of the characters in his work &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;. &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;&#x27;s influence has also been traced by critics to the mecha designs of series that came later, such as &quot;Brain Powerd&quot;, &quot;Gasaraki&quot;, &quot;Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure&quot;, &quot;Devadasy&quot; and &quot;Reideen&quot;, a 2003 remake of the 1975 series &quot;Brave Raideen&quot;. The fight sequence between Asuka&#x27;s Eva-02 and the nine Eva Series present in &quot;End&quot; was an inspiration for animators such as Yoshimichi Kameda and Yokota Takumi, character designer of &quot;Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club&quot;. The design of the Digimon Argomon bears similarities to Eva-01, particularly for its color scheme. &quot;The Edge of Spider-Geddon&quot; also introduces mechas called SP//dr and Ven#m, which are visually similar to Evangelion units.

Possible homages to the series&#x27; mechas have also been traced in &quot;Heroes of the Storm&quot;&#x27;s Genji, D.Va&#x27;s mecha from &quot;Overwatch&quot;, the Sentinels from the Marvel comic book &quot;Mystique&quot;, an episode of the US cartoon &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, the final form of Carnage Kabuto from &quot;One-Punch Man&quot; and Alexandrite from &quot;Steven Universe&quot;. According to USgamer, there is also a mention of Type D equipment in the Gold Saucer in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. ComicBook.com similarly interpreted a scene from &quot;My Hero Academia&quot; in which the character of Muscular mentions that he has &quot;twelve thousand layers&quot; of his muscle armor as a reference to a line from &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot; in which Asuka says that Eva-02 has &quot;twelve thousand plates of fortified armor&quot;; the website also noted that &quot;My Hero Academia&quot; author Kohei Horikoshi declared himself a fan of &quot;Evangelion&quot;. &quot;Pacific Rim&quot; has also been compared to &quot;Evangelion&quot; by critics; giant robots with aesthetic similarities to Evangelion units appear in the film, piloted via a neural connection aided by a special liquid that is similar to LCL. Guillermo del Toro and Travis Beacham, director and screenwriter of the feature film, respectively, have stated that they were not directly influenced by &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, saying that they only saw the series after they had already conceived &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;. In 2016, actress Ayame Goriki cosplayed as Eva-01 in a preview of the first episode of &quot;Rental no koi&quot;, a Japanese television drama that aired in January 2017. A group of researchers from Tokyo Medical and Dental University in 2021 published a study on a liquid capable of delivering oxygen to mice and pigs through the anus; the technique was dubbed by Takanori Takebe, author of the study, as the &quot;EVA method&quot; (&quot;enteral ventilation via anus&quot;) after the Eva units.

<doc id="577373" wikidata="Q7263111" url="?curid=577373" title="Pymble, New South Wales">
<text>Pymble is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Pymble is north of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Ku-ring-gai Council.

West Pymble is a separate suburb to the south west of Pymble, adjacent to the Lane Cove National Park.

Pymble is notable for its gardens, bush reserves and heritage-listed residences and properties of architectural significance, such as the Eric Pratten House.

==History==
Based on settlers&#x27; accounts, the land that came to be known as Pymble was traversed by, and at least periodically inhabited by, the Cammeraigal clan or tribe of the Kuringai (also known as Guringai) Aboriginal people. The Cammeraigal had occupied the land between the Lane Cove River, Hawkesbury and east to the coast. They would travel from grounds at Cowan Creek to the Parramatta River via Pymble - passing west through the land where Pymble Ladies&#x27; College now stands, through the Lane Cove Valley and North Ryde. En route they would reportedly hold corroborees at the current site of the Pymble Reservoir on Telegraph Rd and &quot;camped on the hill...at the junction of Merrivale Rd and Selwyn St.&quot;

Pymble is named after Robert Pymble (1776–1861), an influential early settler whose 1823 land grant comprised some 600 acres, around half the land of the region. The other half (plus a large part of St Ives) was granted to Daniel der Matthew&#x27;s, another influential settler who established the first sawmill in the area.

The region was important to the early Sydney colony as a major supplier of timber for a wide variety of uses. The main timber varieties were blackbutt, stringybark, iron bark and blue gum. In later years it was also an important supplier of agricultural produce. It became widely known for the high quality of its produce and especially for its oranges which had been introduced to the area by Robert Pymble sometime around 1828 and which by later years were grown extensively throughout the region by numerous different growers following land sub-divisions.

Eventually agriculture and small farming gave way to residential development with residential sub-divisions commencing around 1879. The first bank - the Australian Joint Stock Bank - was established in 1888 in a then prominent house known as Grandview built on Pymble Hill ca 1883 by the son of local hotelier Richard Porter. Porter had opened the Gardener&#x27;s Arms Hotel, also on Pymble Hill, in 1866. From this time the centre of commercial activity came to be at the top of the hill around the Pacific Highway and Bannockburn Road area, but with the railway station being located by necessity at the bottom of the hill development began to shift towards the new railway station at the foot of the hill. Pymble Post Office opened there on 6 August 1890.

Sacred Heart Catholic Church opened in Pymble on 10 November 1912.

During the interwar years, Pymble became a desirable residential area for middle-class families, as it was well-connected by rail to the central business district of Sydney, but still offered a semi-rural environment. The 1920s saw continued suburban development with new housing and the population of Pymble began to rise. Many of the houses built in this period were large, single-family homes, and the area became known for its leafy streets and large blocks of land. It had fully transformed into a suburb, retaining much of its character as a peaceful, family-friendly suburb of Sydney. Pymble&#x27;s foundations for the community and infrastructure would continue to grow throughout the 20th century, in characterisations of residential areas, green spaces and local amenities.

Today, Pymble is a predominantly residential area with tree-lined streets, many substantial homes and gardens, numerous parks, nature reserves, and active pockets of commercial activity. Prominent landmarks include Pymble Station and Pymble Hill (Pacific Highway). The station is the centre of transport, shopping and social activities whilst Pymble Hill affords a view of the distant Chatswood skyline. 

Pymble also acts as a conservative area for its rich architectural history with a variety of Federation-style houses.

== Heritage listings ==


Pymble has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Pacific Highway: Pymble Reservoirs No. 1 and No. 2
* 982–984 Pacific Highway: Pymble Substation
* 29 Telegraph Road: Eric Pratten House

==Buildings==

Significant buildings include:

* Ku-ring-gai Town Hall is situated at the top of Pymble Hill on the Pacific Highway. It was formerly the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, which was built in 1934, and is an example of the Inter-War Spanish Mission architectural style. Along with the presbytery next door it is heritage-listed.
* Pymble Chapel (formerly Pymble Methodist Church), on the corner of Mona Vale Road and Bromley Avenue, was built in 1879. It was the second church built in Pymble and is the oldest remaining building in the suburb.
* St Swithun&#x27;s Anglican Church, on Telegraph Road, was built and is an example of the Inter-War Gothic style. It is the only church in Australia named after St Swithun.

Significant houses include:

* &quot;Grandview&quot; is a two-storey, Georgian structure made of sandstone. It was built as a bank but is now used as a home. It has a federal heritage listing.
* &quot;Merrivale&quot; is a local stately home in the Regency style and is considered one of the finest examples of its kind in Ku-ring-gai. It has a state heritage listing.
* &quot;Coppins&quot;, sometimes known as the Eric Pratten House, was designed by Walter Burley Griffin and built . It is one of three large houses designed by Griffin in Ku-ring-gai and is significant because most of his residential buildings were single-storey. It is an example of the Art Deco/Prairie style and has a state heritage listing.
* &quot;Macquarie Cottage&quot;, in Avon Road, was designed by William Hardy Wilson and built in 1918. It is considered a typical example of Wilson&#x27;s work and has both state and federal heritage listings.
* &quot;Sacred Heart Presbytery&quot; is a two-storey house in the Federation Arts and Crafts style, with Gothic touches to the windows. It was built in 1907 and has a state heritage listing.
* &quot;Colinroobie&quot;, a two-storey Federation mansion built in the early 20th century, situated at the corner of the Pacific Highway and Clydesdale Place. It has a state heritage listing.

CDC NSW buses operate route 579 from Pymble station (departing Grandview Street) to East Turramurra (peak hours only) and route 560 from Gordon station to West Pymble (half-hourly service).

Route 575 also operates along the Pacific Highway past the railway station (half-hourly service). It goes to West Pymble and Macquarie University southbound and to Turramurra station and Hornsby station northbound.

There is a taxi stand on the eastern side of the station in Grandview Street.

At the 2021 census, 3.4% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 28.1% by car (either as driver or as passenger) – a typical reflection of the Sydney area mode of transport.

<text>Charanam (meaning &quot;foot&quot;) in Carnatic music (South Indian classical music) is usually the end section of a composition which is sung after the anupallavi.

There may be multiple &quot;charanams&quot; in a composition which make up different stanzas, but in compositions that do not have an anupallavi, there often exists a &quot;samrashti charanam&quot; that combines both the anupallavi and charanam of the composition which directly 
follows the &quot;pallavi&quot;.

The charana [[swara]]s are grouped in four different ways:

*1st - one tala cycle.
*2nd - one tala cycle. 
*3rd - two long tala cycles 
*4th - four long tala cycles

<text>In Carnatic music, the anupallavi comes after the pallavi and is usually the second section of any composition. It is then followed by one or more charanams. The anupallavi is optional. In compositions that do not have an anupallavi, there often exists a Samrashti Charanam that combines both the anupallavi and charanam of the composition which directly follows the pallavi. It is usually sung at a higher pitch and adds more beauty to the music. Usually the Anupallavi is shorter than the Charanam . In Sanskrit &#x27;anu&#x27; means &#x27;next&#x27;.

<text>Angels &amp; Demons is a 2000 bestselling mystery-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published by Pocket Books and then by Corgi Books. The novel introduces the character Robert Langdon, who recurs as the protagonist of Brown&#x27;s subsequent novels. &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; shares many stylistic literary elements with its sequels, such as conspiracies of secret societies, a single-day time frame, and the Catholic Church. Ancient history, architecture, and symbology are also heavily referenced throughout the book. A film adaptation was released on May 15, 2009.

== Background ==
The book contains several ambigrams created by real-life typographer John Langdon. Besides the &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; and &quot;Illuminati&quot; designs, the title of the book is also presented as an ambigram on the hardcover book jacket, and on the inside cover of the paperback versions. The book also contains ambigrams of the words &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Air&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, and &quot; Water&quot;, which has served to bring the art of ambigrams to public attention by virtue of the popularity of the book. The &quot;Illuminati Diamond&quot; mentioned in the book is an ambigram of the four elements that are arranged in the shape of a diamond.

== Plot ==
Leonardo Vetra, one of CERN&#x27;s top physicists who has discovered how to create antimatter, is murdered, his chest branded with an ambigram of the word &quot;Illuminati&quot;, an ancient anti-religious organization thought extinct. CERN director Maximilian Kohler calls Vetra&#x27;s adopted daughter, Vittoria, and Harvard University Professor Robert Langdon, an expert on symbology and religious history, for help. After determining the ambigram is authentic, they discover that a canister of antimatter from Leonardo&#x27;s lab, which has been stolen, will explode in 24 hours when the canister&#x27;s battery runs out. Langdon and Vittoria go to Vatican City, where four Preferiti, the Cardinals who are the favorite candidates for Pope, are kidnapped by the Hassassin, who plans to blow up the Vatican with the antimatter canister and kill the four cardinals under the orders of &quot;Janus&quot;, the leader of the Illuminati.

Believing that the four cardinals will be ritually murdered on the four altars of the &quot;Path of Illumination&quot;, Langdon and Vittoria follow a series of clues left in various churches in and around Rome. After finding the first two men dead (one suffocated by earth and another whose lungs were punctured), they confront the assassin in the act of murdering the third. However, they fail to save the third cardinal and, as the location catches fire, the assassin kidnaps Vittoria. Langdon also fails to save the last cardinal, who is drowned in the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, and confronts the assassin in the Castel Sant&#x27; Angelo, the Church of Illumination. Langdon frees Vittoria and together they send the assassin falling several hundred feet to his death.

Meanwhile, Kohler arrives to confront Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca, the late Pope&#x27;s closest aide. Fearing Kohler is Janus, the two hurry back to St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. However, the Swiss Guards intervene and open fire on Kohler when Ventresca screams. Just before he dies, Kohler gives Langdon a mini video camera which records his confrontation with Ventresca. With Langdon in pursuit, Ventresca ventures into the catacombs and finds the canister atop the tomb of Saint Peter. Ventresca takes the canister to a safe height in a helicopter and parachutes safely just as the canister explodes in the sky. Reacting to this &quot;miracle&quot;, the Cardinals debate whether to elect Ventresca as the new Pope. Meanwhile, Langdon learns from the video that Ventresca himself is Janus. He confesses that he poisoned the Pope upon the Pope&#x27;s revelation that he had fathered a child, and opposes Vetra&#x27;s attempt to bridge science and God. Under the guise of Janus, he recruited the assassin to kill Vetra, steal the antimatter, and kidnap and murder the Preferiti as part of a false flag attack to rally the Catholic Church behind himself and discredit scientific advancement of the kind which had made the antimatter weapon possible.

Cardinal Saverio Mortati, Dean of the College of Cardinals, reveals that Ventresca is in fact the late Pope&#x27;s biological son, conceived with a nun through artificial insemination. Overcome with guilt, Ventresca soaks himself in oil and sets himself on fire before a crowd of onlookers in St. Peter&#x27;s Square. Mortati is unanimously elected Pope by the Cardinals, and Langdon and Vittoria reunite at Hotel Bernini where they spend the night together. Mortati bequeaths the Illuminati&#x27;s final brand to Langdon for his research, with the implicit request he restores it in his final will.

== Characters ==
* Robert Langdon: A professor of symbology at Harvard University and the protagonist of the novel. He is flown to CERN to help investigate the murder of Leonardo Vetra. He is described as wearing a Harris Tweed jacket, a turtleneck sweater, and a pair of chino pants. His name is a tribute to John Langdon.
* Leonardo Vetra: A scientist working at CERN and a priest. He is researching on antimatter when he is murdered by the assassin. He is also the adoptive father of Vittoria.
* Vittoria Vetra: The adopted daughter of Vetra. She, like her father, works with CERN. She is a strict vegetarian. Her research focuses on biology and physics. The reader learns early in the novel that Vittoria worked with her father in their research of antimatter.
* Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca: The &quot;Camerlengo&quot; (papal chamberlain) during the conclave. He murdered the pope, who is later revealed to have been his biological father. His code name for dealing with the assassin is &quot;Janus,&quot; taken from the two-faced Roman god of beginnings and ends.
* Cardinal Saverio Mortati: The most senior cardinal in the conclave, and the current Dean of the College of Cardinals. He was the Devil&#x27;s Advocate for the late pope.
* Commander Ernesto Olivetti: The commandant of the Swiss Guard. He is initially skeptical about the claims of Langdon and Vittoria until he talks with the assassin. He, along with other Swiss Guards, searches desperately for the missing antimatter hidden somewhere in the Vatican. He is killed by the assassin at the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria.
* Captain Elias Rocher: The second-in-command after Commander Olivetti. He is contacted by Maximilian Kohler about his knowledge on the real cause of the events. He is killed by Lt. Chartrand, who was under the impression that Rocher was an &quot;Illuminatus&quot;.
* Hassassin: The killer hired by Janus to fulfill his plans. He is of Middle Eastern origin and displays his sadistic lust for women throughout the novel. He murders Leonardo Vetra, the &quot;Preferiti&quot;, and Commander Olivetti. He dies after being pushed from a balcony by Langdon at Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo and breaking his back on a pile of cannonballs below.
* Maximilian Kohler: The director of CERN. He is feared at CERN despite his paralysis. His wheelchair contains electronic gadgets such as a computer, telephone, pager, video camera, and a gun. He contacts Langdon to help him find the killer of his friend, Leonardo Vetra. He blames the Church for his disability, due to his highly religious parents denying him medical care as a child and becomes a scientist as a way to rebel.
* Gunther Glick and Chinita Macri: A reporter and his photojournalist for the BBC. They are contacted by the assassin regarding the events happening in the Vatican. Glick has a notorious reputation as a sensationalist and conspiracy theorist journalist. Macri, meanwhile, is a veteran camerawoman and a foil to Glick. They have the first hand account on the events in the novel, from the beginning of the conclave to the election of Mortati as pope.
* Lieutenant Chartrand: A young Swiss Guard. He, together with Commander Olivetti and Capt. Rocher, searches desperately for the antimatter hidden somewhere in the Vatican. He shoots and kills Captain Rocher after he is mistaken as an &quot;Illuminatus&quot;. Near the end of the novel, he is sent by the new pope to give the Illuminati Diamond to Langdon on indefinite loan.
* Cardinal Ebner: One of the four preferiti from Frankfurt, Germany. He is killed by smothering, via dirt and soil forced into his mouth, in the undercroft beneath the Chigi Chapel, in Santa Maria del Popolo.
* Cardinal Lamassé: One of the four preferiti from Paris, France. He is killed by punctures to his lungs from which he bled to death on St Peter&#x27;s Square.
* Cardinal Guidera: One of the four preferiti from Barcelona, Spain. He is burned alive within the Santa Maria della Vittoria.
* Cardinal Baggia: One of the four preferiti from Milan, Italy; the favorite to succeed as the new pope. He is drowned by the assassin in the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi.

== Inaccuracies ==
The book&#x27;s first edition contained numerous inaccuracies of location of places in Rome, as well as incorrect uses of Italian language. Some of the language issues were corrected in the following editions.

Aside from the explicit introduction, the book depicts various fictional experts explaining matters in science, technology, and history in which critics have pointed out inaccuracies. An example of this is the antimatter discussions, wherein the book suggests that antimatter can be produced in useful and practical quantities and will be a limitless source of power. CERN published an FAQ page about &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; on their website stating that antimatter cannot be used as an energy source because creating it takes more energy than it produces.

&quot;Angels &amp; Demons Decoded&quot;, a documentary on the American cable television network, The History Channel, premiered on May 10, 2009, shortly before the release of the novel&#x27;s film adaptation. The documentary explores the various bases of the novel&#x27;s story, as well as its inaccuracies. A CERN official, for example, points out that over the last 20 years, approximately 10 billionths of a gram of antimatter had been produced at the facility, whose explosive yield is equivalent to that of a firecracker, far less than is needed for it to be the threat depicted in the novel, where the device holds 0.25 grams.

According to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; language columnist Ben Zimmer, the position of Devil&#x27;s Advocate, which is indicated in the novel to have a role in the selection of the pope, is in fact employed to present arguments against the proposed canonization of a person as a saint (which frequently is the case with &quot;former&quot; popes). While the background of papal candidates are presumably scrutinised, there is no particular office and not one bearing this title. Zimmer adds that the office was abolished by Pope John Paul II in 1983, 17 years before the novel was published. Further, election through acclamation, which plays a role in the climax of the novel, was in fact a method of electing the pope, but was abolished in 1996 by Pope John Paul II, four years before the novel.

<text>In Indian classical music, chitte swara (, ) are a set of solfa passages (phrases of swaras). These are sung after the anupallavi and charanam, in the krithis which enriches the beauty of the composition. Chitte in Kannada means butterfly. The swaras enhance the beauty of the song like butterflies. This is usually done by the performers and not by the composers and in Carnatic music is an important &quot;improvisation&quot; aspect (&quot;manodharma&quot; music).

<text>Sri Lankabhimanya Lakshman Kadirgamar, PC (; , 12 April 1932 – 12 August 2005) was a Sri Lankan lawyer and statesman. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka from 1994 to 2001 and again from April 2004 until his assassination in August 2005. Lakshman Kadirgamar served as the President of Oxford Union in 1958–59.

He achieved international prominence in this position due to his wide-ranging condemnation of the LTTE (Tamil Tigers) and his efforts to have them banned internationally. A lawyer by profession, he was assassinated by an LTTE sniper in August 2005. Accounts of his views on politics and international relations, with much information about his life and career, can be found in the 2012 book &quot;Democracy, Sovereignty and Terror: Lakshman Kadirgamar on the Foundations of International Order&quot;, edited by Professor Adam Roberts.

==Early life==
Lakshman Kadirgamar was born in Manipay, Jaffna District. He hailed from a Tamil family; his father was Samuel J.C.Kadirgamar Sr, JP, UM, a Proctor, who was the President of the Colombo Proctor&#x27;s Association and the founder President of the Law Society of Ceylon. His mother was Edith Rosemand Parimalam Mather. He had four older brothers: S.J.C.Kadirgamar Jr., QC, who became an eminent lawyer in commercial law; Rear Admiral Rajan Kadiragamar who became the head of the Royal Ceylon Navy and Major Selvanathan &quot;Bai&quot; Kadirgamar of the Ceylon Artillery, Thirumalan &quot;Mana&quot; Kadirgamar, a planter who died very young in a motor bike accident. His mother died when he was seven years old and he was looked after by his older sister Eeswari who married Dr. A.M.D. Richards.

==Education==
Kadirgamar received his primary education at C.M.S. Ladies&#x27; College, Colombo and moved with his sister to Matale in the war years, where her husband was posted to. He decided to attend Trinity College, Kandy as a boarder for his secondary education even though all his brothers had attended Royal College, Colombo. It was a common practice to board children in places away from Colombo as Colombo was under the threat of bombing by Japanese. At Trinity, he captained the college first eleven cricket team in 1950 while also competing in the college athletics and rugby teams. He played in the annual Bradby Shield Encounter. He was the winner of the Senior Batting Prize in 1948, a Rugger Coloursman in 1948 and 1949, Trinity Athletics Lion in 1949, and winner of the first Duncan White Challenge Cup for Athletics in 1948. In recognition of his all-round performance in academic and extra curricular spheres, he was awarded the prestigious Ryde Gold medal for the best all round student of 1950. He was also the Senior Prefect of Trinity College.

In 1950 Kadirgamar went on to study law at the University of Ceylon in Colombo and the year after in Peradeniya, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) (Honors) degree in 1953. Kadirgamar was the holder of the All India Inter University 110-metre hurdles title in both 1951 and 1952.

He was the top student with a First Class at the Advocates Intermediate Examination in 1953 of the Ceylon Law College. In 1954 he won the scholarship for the candidate placed first in the First Class at the Advocates Final Examination of the Ceylon Law College and was awarded prizes for the Law of Evidence and the Law of Persons and Property. In 1955 he took oaths as Advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon. He thereafter served as the private secretary to Justice Noel Gratiaen, Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court.

Thereafter he won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied from 1956 to 1959, receiving in 1960, his BLitt degree from the University of Oxford. His thesis was on &quot;Strict Liability in English and Roman-Dutch Law&quot;. In November 1958 he applied successfully to become a barrister of Inner Temple, London.

==Legal career==
Upon leaving Oxford, he took up a legal career. He returned to Ceylon and built up a practice in commercial, industrial and administrative law. He was part of the defense team of the accused of the coup d&#x27;état that was attempted in 1962. In 1963, he was commissioned by Amnesty International to investigate the Buddhist-led resistance campaign that year against the regime in South Vietnam. This was the first-ever report for Amnesty of a situation in an individual country.

Kadirgamar left Ceylon in 1971 following the JVP insurrection that year, moving to England, practising in London for three years. Going on to work for international organisations in Geneva, Kadirgamar served in 1974–6 as a consultant for the International Labour Organization (ILO). Then in 1976 he took up an appointment with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), in which he was appointed in 1983 to the newly created post of Director for Asia and the Pacific. Kadirgamar was the author of a number of scholarly articles published in international legal journals such as the &quot;Modern Law Review&quot;, &quot;South African Law Journal&quot; and &quot;Conveyancer and Property Lawyer&quot;. He was serving as Director, Industrial Property Division and Director, Development Cooperation and External Relations Bureau for Asia and the Pacific at WIPO until he was overlooked for the post of Deputy Director General. He resigned in May 1988.

In 1988 he returned to Sri Lanka and resumed his legal career there. In 1991 he was appointed President&#x27;s Counsel.

==Political career==
Although he had never been actively involved in politics before, and had never even addressed a political rally, he was selected as national list MP in 1994 on the People&#x27;s Alliance (PA) list for the General Elections. Following the victory of the PA, he was appointed Foreign Minister in the PA government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga. He held the post till 2001, playing a significant role in having the LTTE banned internationally. The United States and the United Kingdom proscribed the LTTE on 8 October 1997 and 28 February 2001 respectively, thereby depriving that organisation of a primary source of funding.

Widely respected in his role as foreign minister, he was elected vice-chairman (1997–99) and later chairman (2003–05) of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). In 1998–2001 he was Chair of the Council of Ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). From 1999 onwards he was also a Chair of the South Asia Foundation (SAF), a non-governmental organization.

After the defeat of the government in 2001, he became special adviser on foreign affairs to President Kumaratunga. He became critical of the attempts to negotiate with the Tamil Tigers insurgents in northern Sri Lanka, and of the Ceasefire Agreement concluded on 22 February 2002 between the government and the Tamil Tigers. He criticisms of this agreement, and of the Norwegian mediation effort in Sri Lanka, were most cogently expressed in his speech from the opposition in the parliament in Colombo on 8 May 2003.

On 20 November 2003, Kadirgamar declared his candidacy for the position of Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations. He stood with the support of South Africa, which was critical of incumbent Don McKinnon&#x27;s opposition to Zimbabwean involvement in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2003, at which Zimbabwe withdrew from the organisation. In doing so, Kadirgamar broke the convention of not challenging incumbents for the position, which is usually appointed by consensus. However, at the vote held in early December, he was defeated by the New Zealander, with 11 members voting for him against 40 for McKinnon.

Following the victory of the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance in the 2 April 2004 Sri Lankan legislative elections, he was mentioned as a possible candidate for Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, but on 6 April President Kumaratunga appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa to the post. Four days later, however, he was appointed foreign minister again in the new cabinet.

==Personal life==

===Family===
While at Oxford, Kadirgamar married Angela Malik of French-Pakistani descent. They had two children. The daughter, Ajita Perera Kadirgama, became a broadcaster and son, Sriraghavan Jebaratnam Christian &quot;Ragee&quot; Kadirgamar, became an architect. In 1992, he divorced Angela. His daughter Ajita wrote the book &quot;The Cake That Was Baked At Home - Lakshman Kadirgamar: Snapshots of the Man&#x27;s Life by his Daughter Ajita Kadirgama&quot;. The title according to Ajita&#x27;s book, is from the speech made by Lakshman Kadirgamar on 18 March 2005 at the unveiling of his portrait at the Oxford Union where he said &quot;Oxford Union was the icing on the cake... but the cake was baked at home (Sri Lanka)&quot;. He married again in 1996, Suganthi Wijeysuriya, a lawyer and senior partner at the law firm F. J. &amp; G. de Saram.

===Religious views===
Kadirgamar was born to a Christian family. In 1999 he brought a proposal to the UN General Assembly to make the Buddhist holy day, Vesak Day an international celebration day. In lectures he emphasised the common features in the parables and principles of the great belief-systems: Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. His funeral was held according to Buddhist rites, but one of the speakers was the Anglican bishop of Colombo.

===Political Views===
During a BBC interview he was asked if he thought he was a traitor to the Tamil people since he was a minister in a Sinhalese-dominated government. He said &quot;People who live in Sri Lanka are first and foremost Sri Lankans, then we have our race and religion, which is something given to us at birth&quot;. &quot;We have to live in Sri Lanka as Sri Lankans tolerating all races and religion&quot;.

==Death==
On 12 August 2005, around 2300 (UTC+6), Kadirgamar was shot by an LTTE sniper in Colombo as he was getting out of the swimming pool at his private residence in Cinnamon Gardens. Early reports indicated that he was shot twice in the head, once in the neck, and once in the body. He was rushed to the Colombo National Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His hospital report indicates that he died as a result of his wounds.

Kadirgamar had mentioned the LTTE&#x27;s threats to his life on many occasions. Speaking to The Hindu on 29 July 2005, he said &quot;They (LTTE) can get me anytime. I get very serious reports things are hotting up&quot;.

===Perpetrators===
According to &quot;Asian Tribune&quot;, on 5 September Sri Lankan police arrested two Tamils, Muttiah Sahadevan alias Devan (Kadirgamar&#x27;s neighbour&#x27;s gardener) and Isidor Arokya Nathar alias Babu. The website alleged that they had confessed to having met Charles of the LTTE intelligence and helping out two alleged assassins. The website further claimed that this was seen in some quarters in Sri Lanka as proof that the LTTE was behind his assassination. The suspects arrested in his murder case were released after no evidence was found after over two years in custody.

===International reaction===
India condemned what the foreign ministry described as a &quot;terrorist crime&quot; and offered its full support.

US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who last met Mr Kadirgamar in June, condemned the assassination of Sri Lanka&#x27;s foreign minister as a &quot;senseless murder and vicious act of terror&quot; and urged Sri Lankans not to let it lead to resumed civil war. She praised Kadirgamar as a man of &quot;dignity, honor and integrity, who devoted his life to bringing peace to Sri Lanka&quot;.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency: &quot;Sri Lanka has lost a deeply respected statesman dedicated to peace and national unity.&quot;

Australia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Alexander Downer paid tribute to Kadirgamar saying he played a key role in bringing forward the peace process in Sri Lanka. &quot;Lakshman Kadirgamar was an eminent statesman and a distinguished representative of Sri Lanka,&quot; he said. &quot;He was a man of moderation who sought the path of peace and worked tirelessly for his country.&quot;

Peace brokers Norway also condemned the assassination, with Foreign Minister Jan Petersen describing it as &quot;an atrocious crime and a tragedy for Sri Lanka.&quot;

==Cricket World Cup controversy==
Kadirgamar was known for his combative and ready wit. When Shane Warne justified Australia&#x27;s decision to not play in Colombo during the 1996 Cricket World Cup due to the terrorist threat – saying that he could be targeted by a drive-in bomber while he was shopping – Kadirgamar is reported to have said &quot;shopping is for sissies.&quot; Kadirgamar commented later &quot;There was a storm of protest in Australia. A TV interviewer asked me whether I had ever played cricket. I said I had played before he was born – without helmets and thigh guards, on matting wickets that were full of holes and stones, and I had my share of broken bones to show of it. My friend the Australian foreign minister was drawn into the fray. He phoned me. We decided to cool things down... When the whole episode was over I sent a bouquet of flowers to my Australian counterpart. Flowers are also for sissies.&quot;

==Navaly Church bombing controversy==

Following the Navaly church bombing by the Sri Lanka Air Force on 9 July 1995, which resulted in the deaths of 147 Tamil civilians, Kadirgamar in his role as foreign minister denied that the armed forces committed the attack and rebuked the Red Cross for issuing a statement blaming the armed forces on the basis of &quot;so-called eye witness accounts&quot;.

==Honours==
In 1995 Kadirgamar was made Honorary Master of the Inner Temple—one of the four Inns of Court in London. In 2001 he was awarded an Honorary DLitt at the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. In 2004 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of Balliol College, University of Oxford. The Government of Sri Lanka posthumously awarded him its highest national honour Sri Lankabhimanya.

==Legacy==

The Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies, a think tank on international affairs, was established in his memory a year after his assassination. A statue of Kadirgamar has been erected at the Liberty roundabout in Colombo.

In April 2013 Balliol College established the Lakshman Kadirgamar Fund to assist students from Asia at Balliol College.

In November 2024 the Sri Lanka Embassy honored Kadirgamar at Wisdom Park (New Manila, Quezon City) during the visit of his spouse Suganthi Wijeysuriya. Ambassador Chanaka Talpahewa gifted her with the Philippine Postal Corporation Vesak stamp, followed by the ritual of bodhi pooja offering, circumambulation of ficus religiosa grown from the Bodhi Tree and finally the Buddha Pooja.

<text>An editor-in-chief (EIC), also known as lead editor or chief editor, is a publication&#x27;s editorial leader who has final responsibility for its operations and policies. The editor-in-chief heads all departments of the organization and is held accountable for delegating tasks to staff members and managing them. The term is often used at newspapers, magazines, yearbooks, and television news programs. The editor-in-chief is commonly the link between the publisher or proprietor and the editorial staff.

==Responsibilities==
Typical responsibilities of editors-in-chief include:
* Ensuring that content is journalistically objective
* Fact-checking, spelling, grammar, writing style, page design and photos
* Rejecting writing that appears to be plagiarized, ghostwritten, published elsewhere, or of little interest to readers
* Evaluating and editing content
* Contributing editorial pieces

The term is also applied to academic journals, where the editor-in-chief gives the ultimate decision whether a submitted manuscript will be published. This decision is made by the editor-in-chief after seeking input from reviewers selected on the basis of relevant expertise. For larger journals, the decision is often upon the recommendation of one of several associate editors who each have responsibility for a fraction of the submitted manuscripts.

<text>Ralph George Macchio Jr. ( , ; born November 4, 1961) is an American actor. He is best known for playing Daniel LaRusso in four &quot;Karate Kid&quot; films (the 1984 film &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; and its sequels, &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; in 1986, &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; in 1989, and the upcoming &quot;Karate Kid: Legends&quot; in 2025), as well as in &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; (2018–2025), a sequel television series on YouTube Premium and Netflix. Macchio also played Johnny Cade in &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983), Jeremy Andretti in the television series &quot;Eight Is Enough,&quot; William Gambini in &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; (1992), Eugene Martone in &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1986), and Archie Rodriguez in the television series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;. He also had a recurring role as Officer Haddix in the television series &quot;The Deuce&quot;.

Macchio received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2024, next to that of his &quot;Karate Kid&quot; co-star Pat Morita.

==Early life==
Macchio was born in Huntington, New York in 1961. He is the son of Rosalie (née DeSantis) and Ralph George Macchio Sr., who owned a few laundromats and a wastewater disposal company. Macchio has a younger brother named Steven. His father is of half Italian and half Greek descent, and his mother is of Italian ancestry. In a 1980 screen test, Macchio said his family was from Naples. In 1979, Macchio graduated from Half Hollow Hills High School West in Dix Hills, New York.

Macchio began tap dancing lessons at the age of three and was discovered by a talent agent at the age of 16. He also had minimal training in martial arts, as he learned little karate and jiujitsu when he was in elementary school, long before getting the role of Daniel LaRusso in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; film franchise.

==Career==
===Early roles===
Macchio was cast as Jeremy Andretti for a season in the television series &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;. He next won the role of Johnny Cade in the 1983 film &quot;The Outsiders&quot;.

===&quot;Karate Kid&quot; films===
Macchio&#x27;s work on &quot;The Outsiders&quot; helped him win the role of Daniel LaRusso in the 1984 blockbuster film &quot;The Karate Kid.&quot; Macchio continued to portray the character in two of its sequels, &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; (1989). In &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, Macchio portrayed a &quot;high school weakling turned bullybuster&quot; who learns karate from his friend and mentor, Mr. Miyagi (portrayed by Pat Morita). Macchio&#x27;s work in the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; series made him &quot;stratospherically famous.&quot;

===Later roles===
Macchio appeared in the 1986 film &quot;Crossroads&quot;, portraying music student Eugene Martone. That same year, Macchio starred in &quot;Cuba and His Teddy Bear&quot; on Broadway, alongside Robert De Niro. In 1992, Macchio starred opposite Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei in the hit comedy film &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;, playing Billy Gambini, who was wrongfully accused of murder while passing through a small Alabama town. In 1996, Macchio performed the lead role of J. Pierrepont Finch in the U.S. tour revival of the 1962 Tony Award-winning musical &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, and received positive reviews. Referring to his performance as a chorister in a high school production of the same musical, Macchio said, &quot;I was known as the &#x27;Dancing Kid,&#x27; not that I was all that great. But I had been dancing since the age of three, taking lessons at the June Claire School of Dance in Babylon, Long Island.&quot;

In 2005, Macchio played himself in the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot;. Beginning in October 2008, Macchio appeared in several episodes of the ABC Network television series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; as Archie Rodriguez, a local politician who is Hilda&#x27;s love interest. As of November 2008, Macchio was ranked No. 80 among VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Teen Stars&quot;.

On September 20, 2010, Macchio played the adult Carl Morelli in a staged reading of the Charles Messina play &quot;A Room of My Own&quot; presented by the Bleecker Street Theater Company. In February 2011, it was announced that Macchio would compete on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was eliminated during the semi-finals, placing fourth in the overall competition. Macchio appeared in Canadian band Danko Jones&#x27; music videos for &quot;Had Enough&quot; and &quot;I Think Bad Thoughts.&quot;

In April 2012, Macchio was cast in the film &quot;Hitchcock&quot;, based on the non-fiction book &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho&quot;. He portrayed &quot;Psycho&quot; screenwriter Joseph Stefano. 

===Post-&quot;Karate Kid&quot; and &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;===

Macchio appeared in the 2007 music video for the song &quot;Sweep the Leg&quot; by No More Kings as a caricature of himself and Daniel LaRusso from &quot;The Karate Kid.&quot;

In June 2010, Macchio appeared in Funny or Die&#x27;s online short, &quot;Wax On, F*ck Off&quot;, in which his loved ones stage an intervention to turn the former child star from a well-adjusted family man into an addict besieged with tabloid scandal in order to help his career, with frequent references to &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. A recurring joke in the sketch is that Macchio is confused for an adolescent. The short was lauded by &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s Bruce Fretts, who referred to the video as &quot;sidesplitting&quot; and &quot;comic gold.&quot;

In 2013, Macchio appeared in &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. One of the main characters, Barney Stinson, asserts that Macchio&#x27;s character, Daniel LaRusso, in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; is not the real karate kid; instead, it is Johnny Lawrence, Daniel&#x27;s nemesis in the film.

During a celebration of the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; at the Japanese American National Museum in 2014, Macchio said that the yellow 1947 Ford convertible that his character Daniel receives from Mr. Miyagi in the first film was sitting in his garage.

On August 4, 2017, it was announced that Macchio would reprise his role as Daniel LaRusso in a 10-episode Karate Kid revival series for YouTube Red titled &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; that debuted in 2018. Macchio also co-executive produces the series with William Zabka. The series begins 33 years after the events of the first film, and re-examines the &quot;Miyagi-Verse&quot; narrative from Johnny&#x27;s point of view, beginning with his decision to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo, and the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel, who has been struggling to maintain balance in his life without the guidance of his now deceased mentor, Mr. Miyagi.

In 2022, Macchio published the memoir &quot;Waxing On: The Karate Kid and Me&quot; (Dutton), in which he reflects upon the legacy of the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; films and &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;.

==Personal life==
Macchio was introduced to his future wife, Phyllis Fierro, by his grandmother when he was 15. They got married on April 5, 1987, and have two children, a daughter named Julia (b. 1992) and a son named Daniel (b. 1996, named after Ralph&#x27;s character Daniel LaRusso). Fierro is a nurse practitioner. Julia appeared in seasons 4 and 5 of &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, portraying her father&#x27;s character&#x27;s cousin named Vanessa LaRusso.

Macchio is a fan of the New York Islanders hockey team and was featured as the team&#x27;s celebrity captain in the 1991 Pro Set Platinum trading card series. A 2016 bobblehead promotion saw his likeness in the team&#x27;s uniform donning the iconic &#x27;crane kick&#x27; pose from &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;.

<doc id="577438" wikidata="Q418883" url="?curid=577438" title="Minisatellite">
<text>In genetics, a minisatellite is a tract of repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from 10–60 base pairs) are typically repeated two to several hundred times. Minisatellites occur at more than 1,000 locations in the human genome and they are notable for their high mutation rate and high diversity in the population. Minisatellites are prominent in the centromeres and telomeres of chromosomes, the latter protecting the chromosomes from damage. The name &quot;satellite&quot; refers to the early observation that centrifugation of genomic DNA in a test tube separates a prominent layer of bulk DNA from accompanying &quot;satellite&quot; layers of repetitive DNA. Minisatellites are small sequences of DNA that do not encode proteins but appear throughout the genome hundreds of times, with many repeated copies lying next to each other.

Minisatellites and their shorter cousins, the microsatellites, together are classified as VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) DNA. Confusingly, minisatellites are often referred to as VNTRs, and microsatellites are often referred to as short tandem repeats (STRs) or simple sequence repeats (SSRs).

== Structure ==
Minisatellites consist of repetitive, generally GC-rich, motifs that range in length from 10 to over 100 base pairs. These variant repeats are tandemly intermingled. Some minisatellites contain a central sequence (or &quot;core unit&quot;) of nucleobases &quot;GGGCAGGANG&quot; (where N can be any base) or more generally consist of sequence motifs of purines (adenine (A) and guanine (G)) and pyrimidines (cytosine (C) and thymine (T)).

Hypervariable minisatellites have core units 9–64 bp long and are found mainly at the centromeric regions.

In humans, 90% of minisatellites are found at the sub-telomeric region of chromosomes. The human telomere sequence itself is a tandem repeat: TTAGGG TTAGGG TTAGGG ...

== Function ==
Minisatellites have been implicated as regulators of gene expression (e.g. at levels of transcription, alternative splicing, or imprint control). They are generally non-coding DNA but sometimes are part of possible genes.

Minisatellites also constitute the chromosomal telomeres, which protect the ends of a chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighbouring chromosomes.

==Mutability==
Minisatellites have been associated with chromosome fragile sites and are proximal to a number of recurrent translocation breakpoints.

Some human minisatellites (~1%) have been demonstrated to be hypermutable, with an average mutation rate in the germline higher than 0.5% up to over 20%, making them the most unstable region in the human genome known to date. While other genomes (mouse, rat and pig) contain minisatellite-like sequences, none was found to be hypermutable. Since all hypermutable minisatellites contain internal variants, they provide extremely informative systems for analyzing the complex turnover processes that occur at this class of tandem repeat. Minisatellite variant repeat mapping by PCR (MVR-PCR) has been extensively used to chart the interspersion patterns of variant repeats along the array, which provides details on the structure of the alleles before and after mutation.

Studies have revealed distinct mutation processes operating in somatic and germline cells. Somatic instability detected in blood DNA shows simple and rare intra-allelic events two to three orders of magnitude lower than in sperm. In contrast, complex inter-allelic conversion-like events occur in the germline.

Additional analyses of DNA sequences flanking human minisatellites have also revealed an intense and highly localized meiotic crossover hotspot that is centered upstream of the unstable side of minisatellite arrays. Repeat turnover therefore appears to be controlled by recombinational activity in DNA that flanks the repeat array and results in a polarity of mutation. These findings have suggested that minisatellites most probably evolved as bystanders of localized meiotic recombination hotspots in the human genome.

It has been proposed that minisatellite sequences encourage chromosomes to swap DNA. In alternative models, it is the presence of neighbouring double-strand hotspots which is the primary cause of minisatellite repeat copy number variations. Somatic changes are suggested to result from replication difficulties (which might include replication slippage, among other phenomena).

Studies have shown that the evolutionary fate of minisatellites tends towards an equilibrium distribution in the size of alleles, until mutations in the flanking DNA affect the recombinational activity of a minisatellite by suppressing DNA instability. Such an event would ultimately lead to the extinction of a hypermutable minisatellite by meiotic drive.

==History==
The first human minisatellite was discovered in 1980 by A.R. Wyman and R. White. Discovering their high level of variability, Sir Alec Jeffreys developed DNA fingerprinting based on minisatellites, solving the first immigration case by DNA in 1985, and the first forensic murder case, the Enderby murders in the United Kingdom, in 1986. Minisatellites were subsequently also used for genetic markers in linkage analysis and population studies, but were soon replaced by microsatellite profiling in the 1990s.

The term satellite DNA originates from the observation in the 1960s of a fraction of sheared DNA that showed a distinct buoyant density, detectable as a &quot;satellite peak&quot; in density gradient centrifugation, and that was subsequently identified as large centromeric tandem repeats. When shorter (10–30-bp) tandem repeats were later identified, they came to be known as minisatellites. Finally, with the discovery of tandem iterations of simple sequence motifs, the term microsatellites was coined.

<doc id="577439" wikidata="Q121077" url="?curid=577439" title="Bhimsen Joshi">
<text>Bharat Ratna Pandit Bhimsen Gururaj Joshi (; ; 4 February 1922 – 24 January 2011), also known by the honorific prefix Pandit, was one of the greatest Indian vocalists in the Hindustani classical tradition from the Indian subcontinent. He is known for the &quot;khayal&quot; form of singing, as well as for his popular renditions of devotional music (&quot;bhajans&quot; and &quot;abhangs&quot;). Joshi belongs to the Kirana gharana tradition of Hindustani Classical Music. He is noted for his concerts, and between 1964 and 1982 Joshi toured Afghanistan, Italy, France, Canada and USA. He was the first musician from India whose concerts were advertised through posters in New York City. Joshi was instrumental in organising the Sawai Gandharva Music Festival annually, as homage to his guru, Sawai Gandharva.

In 1998, he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour conferred by Sangeet Natak Akademi, India&#x27;s National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama. Subsequently, he received the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian honour, in 2009.

== Early life ==
Bhimsen Joshi was born on 4 February 1922 in a Kannada Deshastha Madhva Brahmin family to Gururajrao Joshi and Godavaribai at Ron in Dharwad district in Karnataka. His father, Gururaj Joshi, was a school teacher. Bhimsen was the eldest among 16 siblings. He lost his mother at a young age.

As a child, Joshi was fascinated with music and musical instruments like the harmonium and tanpura and would often follow processions accompanied by music bands. This exercise often tired him and he would curl up somewhere and sleep, forcing his parents to go to the police after efforts to trace him failed. Fed up, his father Gururajacharya Joshi came up with the solution, writing &quot;son of teacher Joshi&quot; on Joshi&#x27;s shirts. This worked and those who found the boy sleeping would safely deposit him back to his house.

== Musical training ==

His first music teacher was Channappa of Kurtakoti of dhobi community, who had trained with the veteran singer Inayat Khan. After learning Ragas Bhairav and Bhimpalasi, the one and only unique vigorous style of rendering he developed along with advanced trainings by other teachers is attributed to the basic training he received from Channappa. 

=== Searching for a guru ===

Joshi heard a recording of Abdul Karim Khan&#x27;s Thumri &quot;Piya Bin Nahi Aavat Chain&quot; in Raga Jhinjhoti when he was a child, which inspired him to become a musician. During this time, he also heard Pandit Sawai Gandharva at a performance in Kundgol. In 1933, the 11-year-old Joshi left Dharwad for Bijapur to find a master and learn music. With the help of money lent by his co-passengers in the train, Joshi reached Dharwad first, briefly studying with Dharwad-native Pt. Gururao Deshpande, and later went to Pune. Later he moved to Gwalior and got into Madhava Music School, a school run by Maharajas of Gwalior, with the help of famous &quot;sarod&quot; player Hafiz Ali Khan. He traveled for three years around North India, including in Delhi, Kolkata, Gwalior, Lucknow and Rampur, trying to find a good guru. He met Ustad Mushtaq Husain Khan of Rampur Gharana and stayed for more than one year. Eventually, his father succeeded in tracking him down in Jalandhar and brought young Joshi back home.

=== Sawai Gandharva ===

In 1936, Sawai Gandharva, a native of Dharwad, agreed to be his guru. Joshi stayed at his house in the &quot;guru-shishya&quot; (teacher-student) tradition. Joshi continued his training with Sawai Gandharva. His senior fellow student was Gangubai Hangal of Besta (fishermen) community, whom Joshi used to respectfully address as &quot;akka&quot; (elder sister).

== Career ==

Joshi first performed live in 1941 at the age of 19. His debut album, containing a few devotional songs in Marathi and Hindi, was released by HMV the next year in 1942. Later Joshi moved to Mumbai in 1943 and worked as a radio artist. His performance at a concert in 1946 to celebrate his guru Sawai Gandharva&#x27;s 60th birthday won him accolades both from the audience and his guru. In 1984, he received his 1st Platinum Disc, being the first Hindustani Vocalist to receive the award.

=== Hindustani classical music ===

Joshi&#x27;s performances have been acknowledged by music critics such as S. N. Chandrashekhar of the Deccan Herald to be marked by spontaneity, accurate notes, dizzyingly-paced &quot;taans&quot; which make use of his exceptional voice training, and a mastery over rhythm. In his especially mid singing career (i.e. the 60s &amp; 70s) Joshi&#x27;s most iconic and noticeable trait was his use of swift and long aakar taans, exemplifying tremendous and almost unrivalled breath-control, although he rarely used sargam taans. The Hindu, in an article written after he was awarded the Bharat Ratna, said: &quot;Bhimsen Joshi was ever the wanderer, engendering brilliant phrases and tans more intuitively than through deliberation&quot;. Joshi occasionally employed the use of sargam and tihai, and often sang traditional compositions of the . His music often injected surprising and sudden turns of phrase, for example through the unexpected use of boltaans. Over the years, his repertoire tended to favour a relatively small number of complex and serious ragas; however, he remained one of the most prolific exponents of Hindustani classical music. Some of Joshi&#x27;s more popular ragas include Shuddha Kalyan, Miyan Ki Todi, Puriya Dhanashri, Multani, Bhimpalasi, Darbari, Malkauns, Abhogi, Lalit, Yaman, Asavari Todi, Miyan ki malhar and Ramkali. He was a purist who has not dabbled in experimental forms of music, except for a series of Jugalbandi recordings with the Carnatic singer M. Balamuralikrishna.

Joshi&#x27;s singing has been influenced by many musicians, including Smt. Kesarbai Kerkar, Begum Akhtar and as aforementioned, Ustad Amir Khan. Joshi assimilated into his own singing various elements that he liked in different musical styles and Gharanas.
He along with Smt. Gangubai Hangal along with others took Kirana gharana to heights and are proudly referred as worthy son and daughter of kirana gharana. Both were from Old Dharwad district.

Pandit Purshottam Walawalkar used to accompany Pandit Bhimsen Joshi on the harmonium. Also Pandit Tulsidas Borkar used to accompany Panditji on the harmonium.

=== Devotional music ===

In devotional music, Joshi was most acclaimed for his Hindi, Marathi and Kannada Bhajan singing. He has recorded bhakti songs in Marathi, &quot;Santavani&quot;, Kannada &quot;Dasavani&quot;.

=== Patriotic music ===

Joshi was widely recognised in India due to his performance in the Mile Sur Mera Tumhara music video (1988), which begins with him and which was composed originally by him when he was asked to do so by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The video was created for the purpose of national integration in India, and highlights the diversity of Indian culture. Joshi was also a part of Jana Gana Mana produced by A. R. Rahman on the occasion of the 50th year of Indian Republic.

=== Playback singing ===

Joshi sang for several films, including &quot;Basant Bahar&quot; (1956) with Manna Dey, in Marathi movie &quot;Swayamvar zale Siteche&quot; (1964) for famous song &quot;Ramya Hi Swargahun lanka&quot;, in Kannada movie Sandhya Raga (1966) where he has sung extensively. It includes a song &quot;e pariya sobagu&quot; rendered in both Hindustani and Carnatic () styles along with M. Balamuralikrishna. He sang &quot;Birbal My Brother&quot; (1973) with Pandit Jasraj. He also sang for the Bengali film Tansen (1958) and Bollywood Movie &quot;Ankahee&quot; (1985) which later fetched him National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer. His song &#x27;Bhagyadalakshmi baaramma&#x27;, a Purandara Dasa composition, was used by Anant Nag and Shankar Nag in the Kannada film &quot;Nodi Swami Naavu Irodhu Heege&quot;. He also sang as a playback singer for the Marathi film Gulacha Ganapati, produced and directed by P. L. Deshpande.
=== Sawai Gandharva Music Festival ===

Joshi and his friend Nanasaheb Deshpande organised the Sawai Gandharva Music Festival as a homage to his guru, Sawai Gandharva, along with the Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal in 1953, marking Gandharva&#x27;s first death anniversary. The festival has been held ever since, typically on the second weekend of December in Pune, Maharashtra also in kundagol Dharwad district and has become not only a cultural event for the city, but an annual pilgrimage for Hindustani Classical music lovers all over the world. Joshi conducted the festival annually since 1953, until his retirement in 2002.

== Legacy ==
A classicist by training and temperament, Joshi was renowned for having evolved an approach that sought to achieve a balance between what may be termed as &quot;traditional values and mass-culture tastes&quot; and as such he went on to have supposedly the largest commercially recorded repertoire in Hindustani vocal music. Pt. Joshi&#x27;s iconic status in the music world has earned him a whole generation of who by merely listening to him have picked up his style and not through any formal tutelage.
His greatest endeavour in perpetuating his legacy could be the Sawai Gandharva Festival held at Pune annually since the year 1953 which seeks to promote a certain music culture.

Madhav Gudi, Prof Baldev Singh Bali, Narayan Deshpande, Shrikant Deshpande, Shrinivas Joshi, Anand Bhate and others are some of his more well-known disciples.

Since 2012 Pandit Bhimsen Joshi Lifetime Achievement Award is given by the Government of Maharashtr to artist who has been doing outstanding work in the field of classical singing and playing for a long time.

In September 2014, a postage stamp featuring Joshi was released by India Post commemorating his contributions to Hindustani music.

== Personal life ==

Joshi married twice. His first wife was Sunanda Katti, the daughter of his maternal uncle, whom he married in 1944. He had four children from Sunanda; Raghavendra, Usha, Sumangala, and Anand. In 1951, he married Vatsala Mudholkar, his co-actor in the Kannada play Bhagya-Shree. Bigamous marriages among Hindus were prohibited by law in the Bombay Presidency; so he took up residency in Nagpur (capital of Central Province and Berar in 1951) where bigamy was allowed and married there for the second time. He did not divorce or separate from Sunanda. With Vatsala, he had three children; Jayant, Shubhada, and Shrinivas Joshi. Initially, both his wives and families lived together, but when this did not work out, his first wife moved out with the family to live in a house in Limayewadi in Sadashiv Peth, Pune, where Joshi continued to visit them.

Joshi struggled with alcoholism, which he overcame by the late 1970s.

Outside of music, Joshi was passionate about cars and had a deep knowledge of auto mechanics.

== Death==
Joshi was admitted to Sahyadri Super Speciality Hospital on 31 December 2010 with gastrointestinal bleeding and bilateral pneumonia. Due to difficulty in breathing, he was put on ventilator support. He suffered convulsions and was put on dialysis too during his stay in hospital. Though he recovered briefly for three days when he was taken off the ventilator, his condition deteriorated thereafter. He died on 24 January 2011. He was cremated at Vaikunth Crematorium in Pune with full state honours.

<text>Busy work (also known as make-work and busywork) is an activity that is undertaken to pass time and stay busy but in and of itself has little or no actual value. Busy work occurs in business, military and other settings, in situations where people may be required to be present but may lack the opportunities, skills or need to do something more productive. People may engage in busy work to maintain an appearance of activity, in order to avoid criticism of being inactive or idle.

==Education and work settings==

In business and work settings, people may engage in busy work to maintain an appearance of activity to protect their employment status (to avoid termination or sanctions).

Workers believe that it is more important to maintain a constant appearance of working urgently so that they and others believe that what is being done is important. Constant urgency in workers can lead to disproportionate distribution of actual work, as workers may put off important work by attempting to complete previously designated less important tasks. Maintaining very high levels of constant busyness may actually be detrimental to the operations of a business or organization in which new tasks are not undertaken in a timely manner because workers are always very busy. That can also lead to workers taking shortcuts to accomplish tasks more quickly, which can negatively affect the quality of work results.

Busy work also can be counterproductive in work settings because it may not be aligned with the overall objectives and priorities of an organization&#x27;s plans for attaining and maintaining success in its ventures. The assumption that activity in the workplace is more important than productivity in the workplace can lead to employees thinking that quantity of work is better than quality of work, which is not productive to the overall functioning of a business.

<doc id="577441" wikidata="Q1780743" url="?curid=577441" title="Compact operator">
<text>In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, a compact operator is a linear operator formula_1, where formula_2 are normed vector spaces, with the property that formula_3 maps bounded subsets of formula_4 to relatively compact subsets of formula_5 (subsets with compact closure in formula_5). Such an operator is necessarily a bounded operator, and so continuous. Some authors require that formula_2 are Banach, but the definition can be extended to more general spaces.

Any bounded operator &quot;formula_3&quot; that has finite rank is a compact operator; indeed, the class of compact operators is a natural generalization of the class of finite-rank operators in an infinite-dimensional setting. When &quot;formula_5&quot; is a Hilbert space, it is true that any compact operator is a limit of finite-rank operators, so that the class of compact operators can be defined alternatively as the closure of the set of finite-rank operators in the norm topology. Whether this was true in general for Banach spaces (the approximation property) was an unsolved question for many years; in 1973 Per Enflo gave a counter-example, building on work by Alexander Grothendieck and Stefan Banach.

The origin of the theory of compact operators is in the theory of integral equations, where integral operators supply concrete examples of such operators. A typical Fredholm integral equation gives rise to a compact operator &quot;K&quot; on function spaces; the compactness property is shown by equicontinuity. The method of approximation by finite-rank operators is basic in the numerical solution of such equations. The abstract idea of Fredholm operator is derived from this connection.

== Equivalent formulations ==
A linear map formula_1 between two topological vector spaces is said to be compact if there exists a neighborhood &quot;formula_11&quot; of the origin in &quot;formula_4&quot; such that formula_13 is a relatively compact subset of &quot;formula_5&quot;.

Let formula_2 be normed spaces and formula_1 a linear operator. Then the following statements are equivalent, and some of them are used as the principal definition by different authors
* &quot;formula_3&quot; is a compact operator;
* the image of the unit ball of &quot;formula_4&quot; under &quot;formula_3&quot; is relatively compact in &quot;formula_5&quot;;
* the image of any bounded subset of &quot;formula_4&quot; under &quot;formula_3&quot; is relatively compact in &quot;formula_5&quot;;
* there exists a neighbourhood formula_11 of the origin in &quot;formula_4&quot; and a compact subset formula_26 such that formula_27;
* for any bounded sequence formula_28 in &quot;formula_4&quot;, the sequence formula_30 contains a converging subsequence.
If in addition &quot;formula_5&quot; is Banach, these statements are also equivalent to:
* the image of any bounded subset of &quot;formula_4&quot; under &quot;formula_3&quot; is totally bounded in formula_5.

If a linear operator is compact, then it is continuous.

== Properties ==

In the following, formula_35 are Banach spaces, formula_36 is the space of bounded operators formula_37 under the operator norm, and formula_38 denotes the space of compact operators formula_37. formula_40 denotes the identity operator on formula_4, formula_42, and formula_43.

* formula_38 is a closed subspace of formula_36 (in the norm topology). Equivalently, 
** given a sequence of compact operators formula_46 mapping formula_37 (where formula_2are Banach) and given that formula_46 converges to formula_3 with respect to the operator norm, &quot;formula_3&quot; is then compact.
* Conversely, if formula_2 are Hilbert spaces, then every compact operator from formula_37 is the limit of finite rank operators. Notably, this &quot;approximation property&quot; is false for general Banach spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.
*formula_54 where the composition of sets is taken element-wise. In particular, formula_55 forms a two-sided ideal in formula_56.
*Any compact operator is strictly singular, but not vice versa.
* A bounded linear operator between Banach spaces is compact if and only if its adjoint is compact (&quot;Schauder&#x27;s theorem&quot;). 
** If formula_1 is bounded and compact, then:
*** the closure of the range of &quot;formula_3&quot; is separable.
*** if the range of &quot;formula_3&quot; is closed in &quot;Y&quot;, then the range of &quot;formula_3&quot; is finite-dimensional.
* If formula_4 is a Banach space and there exists an invertible bounded compact operator formula_62 then &quot;formula_4&quot; is necessarily finite-dimensional.

Now suppose that formula_4 is a Banach space and formula_65 is a compact linear operator, and formula_66 is the adjoint or transpose of &quot;T&quot;.
* For any formula_67, formula_68  is a Fredholm operator of index 0. In particular, formula_69 is closed. This is essential in developing the spectral properties of compact operators. One can notice the similarity between this property and the fact that, if &quot;formula_70&quot; and &quot;formula_71&quot; are subspaces of &quot;formula_4&quot; where formula_70 is closed and &quot;formula_71&quot; is finite-dimensional, then formula_75 is also closed.
* If formula_76 is any bounded linear operator then both formula_77 and formula_78 are compact operators.
* If formula_79 then the range of formula_80 is closed and the kernel of formula_80 is finite-dimensional.
* If formula_79 then the following are finite and equal: formula_83
* The spectrum formula_84 of &quot;formula_3&quot; is compact, countable, and has at most one limit point, which would necessarily be the origin.
* If formula_4 is infinite-dimensional then formula_87.
* If formula_79 and formula_89 then formula_90 is an eigenvalue of both &quot;formula_3&quot; and formula_92.
* For every formula_93 the set formula_94 is finite, and for every non-zero formula_89 the range of formula_80 is a proper subset of &quot;X&quot;.

==Origins in integral equation theory==

A crucial property of compact operators is the Fredholm alternative, which asserts that the existence of solution of linear equations of the form

formula_97

(where &quot;K&quot; is a compact operator, &quot;f&quot; is a given function, and &quot;u&quot; is the unknown function to be solved for) behaves much like as in finite dimensions. The spectral theory of compact operators then follows, and it is due to Frigyes Riesz (1918). It shows that a compact operator &quot;K&quot; on an infinite-dimensional Banach space has spectrum that is either a finite subset of C which includes 0, or the spectrum is a countably infinite subset of C which has 0 as its only limit point. Moreover, in either case the non-zero elements of the spectrum are eigenvalues of &quot;K&quot; with finite multiplicities (so that &quot;K&quot; − λ&quot;I&quot; has a finite-dimensional kernel for all complex λ ≠ 0).

An important example of a compact operator is compact embedding of Sobolev spaces, which, along with the Gårding inequality and the Lax–Milgram theorem, can be used to convert an elliptic boundary value problem into a Fredholm integral equation. Existence of the solution and spectral properties then follow from the theory of compact operators; in particular, an elliptic boundary value problem on a bounded domain has infinitely many isolated eigenvalues. One consequence is that a solid body can vibrate only at isolated frequencies, given by the eigenvalues, and arbitrarily high vibration frequencies always exist.

The compact operators from a Banach space to itself form a two-sided ideal in the algebra of all bounded operators on the space. Indeed, the compact operators on an infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space form a maximal ideal, so the quotient algebra, known as the Calkin algebra, is simple. More generally, the compact operators form an operator ideal.

==Compact operator on Hilbert spaces==

For Hilbert spaces, another equivalent definition of compact operators is given as follows.

An operator formula_3 on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space formula_99,

:formula_100,

is said to be &quot;compact&quot; if it can be written in the form

:formula_101,

where formula_102 and formula_103 are orthonormal sets (not necessarily complete), and formula_104 is a sequence of positive numbers with limit zero, called the singular values of the operator, and the series on the right hand side converges in the operator norm. The singular values can accumulate only at zero. If the sequence becomes stationary at zero, that is formula_105 for some formula_106 and every formula_107, then the operator has finite rank, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a finite-dimensional range, and can be written as

:formula_108.

An important subclass of compact operators is the trace-class or nuclear operators, i.e., such that formula_109. While all trace-class operators are compact operators, the converse is not necessarily true. For example formula_110 tends to zero for formula_111 while formula_112.

== Completely continuous operators ==
Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be Banach spaces. A bounded linear operator &quot;T&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is called completely continuous if, for every weakly convergent sequence formula_113 from &quot;X&quot;, the sequence formula_114 is norm-convergent in &quot;Y&quot; . Compact operators on a Banach space are always completely continuous. If &quot;X&quot; is a reflexive Banach space, then every completely continuous operator &quot;T&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is compact.

Somewhat confusingly, compact operators are sometimes referred to as &quot;completely continuous&quot; in older literature, even though they are not necessarily completely continuous by the definition of that phrase in modern terminology.

== Examples ==
* Every finite rank operator is compact.
* For formula_115 and a sequence &quot;(tn)&quot; converging to zero, the multiplication operator (&quot;Tx&quot;)&quot;n = tn xn&quot; is compact.
* For some fixed &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]; R), define the linear operator &quot;T&quot; from &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]; R) to &quot;C&quot;([0, 1]; R) by formula_116That the operator &quot;T&quot; is indeed compact follows from the Ascoli theorem.
* More generally, if Ω is any domain in R&quot;n&quot; and the integral kernel &quot;k&quot; : Ω × Ω → R is a Hilbert–Schmidt kernel, then the operator &quot;T&quot; on &quot;L&quot;2(Ω; R) defined by formula_117 is a compact operator.
* By Riesz&#x27;s lemma, the identity operator is a compact operator if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.

<doc id="577443" wikidata="Q687406" url="?curid=577443" title="Sarod">
<text>The sarod is a stringed instrument, used in Hindustani music on the Indian subcontinent. Along with the sitar, it is among the most popular and prominent instruments. It is known for a deep, weighty, introspective sound, in contrast with the sweet, overtone-rich texture of the sitar, with sympathetic strings that give it a resonant, reverberant quality. A fretless instrument, it can produce the continuous slides between notes known as &quot;meend&quot; (glissandi), which are important in Indian music.

==Origins==
The word sarod was introduced from Persian during the late Mughal Empire and is much older than the Indian musical instrument. It can be traced back to &quot;sorūd&quot; meaning &quot;song&quot;, &quot;melody&quot;, &quot;hymn&quot; and further to the Persian verb &quot;sorūdan&quot;, which correspondingly means &quot;to sing&quot;, &quot;to play a musical instrument&quot;, but also means &quot;to compose&quot;.

Alternatively, the shahrud may have given its name to the sarod. The Persian word šāh-rūd is made up of &quot;šāh&quot; (shah or king) and &quot;rūd&quot; (string). Many scholars of Indian classical music believe that the sarod is a combination of the ancient chitravina, the medieval Indian rabab and modern sursingar.

The origins of sarod music can be traced back to the rhythmic and vibrant melodies of the Afghani rubāb, as well as the Indian seni rubāb, which held a significant place in the Mughal royal courts. The sarod emerged in India during the early 19th century as an evolved form of the Afghani rubāb, commonly played in the regions to the east of Delhi, inhabited by Afghan communities. In the latter half of the 19th century, the progeny of the rubab musician and Afghan merchant Ghulam Bandagi Khan endowed the instrument with metal strings and a metallic plate, elements that are characteristic of the contemporary sarod. These enhancements facilitated longer-lasting notes and the ability to execute the intricate embellishments characteristic of dhrupad and khyal styles of music.
Lalmani Misra opines in his &quot;Bharatiya Sangeet Vadya&quot; that the sarod is a combination of the ancient chitravina, the medieval rubab and modern sursingar. Another instrument, the sur-rabab, is known to exist, which has the characteristics of both the dhrupad rabab/seniya rabab and the sarod. The sur-rabab has the structure of the dhrupad rabab but has a metal fretboard and uses metal strings.

Among the many conflicting and contested histories of the sarod, there is one that attributes its invention to the ancestors of the present-day sarod maestro, Amjad Ali Khan. Amjad Ali Khan&#x27;s ancestor Mohammad Hashmi Khan Bangash, a musician and horse trader, came to India with the Afghan rubab in the mid-18th century, and became a court musician to the Maharajah of Rewa (now in Madhya Pradesh). It was his descendants, notably his grandson Ghulam Ali Khan Bangash, a court musician in Gwalior, who changed the rubab into the sarod we know today. A parallel theory credits descendants of Madar Khan, Niyamatullah Khan in particular, with the same innovation around 1820. The sarod in its present form dates back to approximately 1820, when it started gaining recognition as a serious instrument in Rewa, Shahjahanpur, Gwalior and Lucknow. In the 20th century, the sarod was improved significantly by Allauddin Khan and his brother Ayet Ali Khan. They increased the number of chikari (drone) strings and increased the number of tarafdar (sympathetic) strings. However, as is the case with most young, evolving instruments, much work remains to be done in the area of sarod luthiery in order to achieve reliable customization, and precise replication of successful instruments. This reflects the general state of Indian instrument-making in the present day. Although the sarod has been referred to as a &quot;bass rubab&quot; its tonal bandwidth is actually considerably greater than that of the rubab, especially in the middle and high registers

==Design==
The design of the instrument depends on the school (gharana) of playing. There are three distinguishable types:

The conventional sarod is a 17 to 25-stringed lute-like instrument—four to five main strings used for playing the melody, one or two drone strings, two &quot;chikari&quot; strings and nine to eleven sympathetic strings. The design of this early model is generally credited to Niyamatullah Khan of the Lucknow Gharana as well as Ghulam Ali Khan of the Gwalior-Bangash Gharana. Among the contemporary sarod players, this basic design is kept intact by two streams of sarod playing. Amjad Ali Khan and his disciples play this model, as do the followers of Radhika Mohan Maitra. Both Amjad Ali Khan and Buddhadev Dasgupta have introduced minor changes to their respective instruments which have become the design templates for their followers. Both musicians use sarods made of teak wood, and a soundboard made of goat skin stretched across the face of the resonator. Buddhadev Dasgupta prefers a polished stainless steel fingerboard for the ease of maintenance while Amjad Ali Khan uses the conventional chrome or nickel-plated cast steel fingerboard. Visually, the two variants are similar, with six pegs in the main pegbox, two rounded chikari pegs and 11 (Amjad) to 15 (Buddhadev) sympathetic strings. The descendants of Niyamatullah Khan (namely Irfan Khan and Ghulfam Khan) also play similar instruments. Some of the followers of Radhika Mohan Maitra still carry the second resonator on their sarods. Amjad Ali Khan and his followers have rejected the resonator altogether. These instruments are typically tuned to B, which is the traditional setting.

Another type is that designed by Allauddin Khan and his brother Ayet Ali Khan. This instrument, referred to by David Trasoff as the 1934 Maihar Prototype, is larger and longer than the conventional instrument, though the fingerboard is identical to the traditional sarod. This instrument has 25 strings in all. These include four main strings, four &quot;jod&quot; strings (tuned to &quot;Ni&quot; or &quot;Dha&quot;, &quot;R/r&quot;, &quot;G/g&quot; and &quot;Sa&quot; respectively), two &quot;chikari&quot; strings (tuned to &quot;Sa&quot; of the upper octave) and fifteen &quot;tarab&quot; strings. The main strings are tuned to &quot;Ma&quot; (&quot;fa&quot;), &quot;Sa&quot; (&quot;do&quot;), lower &quot;Pa&quot; (&quot;so&quot;) and lower &quot;Sa&quot;, giving the instrument a range of three octaves. The Maihar sarod lends itself extremely well to the presentation of alap with the four &quot;jod&quot; strings providing a backdrop for the ambiance of the raga. This variant is, however, not conducive to the performance of clean right-hand picking on individual strings. The instrument is typically tuned to C.

Sarod strings are either made of steel or phosphor bronze. Most contemporary sarod players use German or American-made strings, such as Roslau (Germany), Pyramid (Germany) and Precision (USA). The strings are plucked with a triangular plectrum (&quot;java&quot;) made of polished coconut shell, ebony, cocobolo wood, horn, cowbone, Delrin or other such materials. Early sarod players used plain wire plectrums, which yielded a soft, ringing tone.

==Playing technique==
The lack of frets and the tension of the strings make the sarod a very demanding instrument to play, as the strings must be pressed hard against the fingerboard.

There are two approaches to stopping the strings of the sarod. One involves using the tip of one&#x27;s fingernails to stop the strings, and the other uses a combination of the nail and the fingertip to stop the strings against the fingerboard.

Fingering techniques and how they are taught depends largely on the personal preferences of musicians rather than on the basis of school affiliation. Radhika Mohan Maitra, for example, used the index, middle and ring finger of his left hand to stop the string, just like followers of Allauddin Khan do. Maitra, however, made much more extensive use of the third fingernail for slides and hammers. Amjad Ali Khan, while a member of approximately the same stylistic school as Radhika Mohan, prefers to use just the index and middle fingers of his left hand. Amjad Ali is, however, pictured circa 1960 playing with all three fingers.

<text>The Serbian Broadcasting Corporation, more commonly referred to as Radio Television of Serbia (), or RTS (), is the state-owned public radio and television broadcaster of Serbia. RTS has four organizational units – radio, television, music production, and record label (PGP-RTS). It is financed primarily through monthly subscription fees and advertising revenue.

==History==
===Radio Belgrade-Rakovica (1924-1929)===
Radio Belgrade is among the oldest electronic media in Europe and its first broadcast from the radio-telegraph station was in Rakovica on 1 October 1924 as &quot;Radio Belgrade-Rakovica&quot;. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 6:45 PM to 7:45 PM, concerts were broadcast, along with news, service information, advertisements, water level updates, and stock market reports. The news was prepared by journalists from &quot;Politika&quot; and &quot;Dnevne novosti&quot;, while the music portion of the program was directed by the Belgrade Opera.

Engineers Mihailo Simić and Dobrivoje Petrović broadcast the first test concert on 19 September 1924, from a studio at Knez Mihailova 42, through a transmitter in Rakovica. Ksenija Rogovska sang an aria from &quot;Tosca,&quot; Žika Tomić performed Stevan Hristić&#x27;s composition &quot;Behar,&quot; Karel Holub played Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Violin Concerto in E minor,&quot; and pianist Velizar Gođevac played two Chopin etudes. Vitomir Bogić recited the scene &quot;Under the Balcony&quot; from Edmond Rostand&#x27;s &quot;Cyrano&quot; and sonnets by Jovan Dučić. Since the test concert sparked great public interest, it was repeated a week later.

From 1924 to 1929, radio professionals gradually mastered transmission techniques and program creation and obtained the necessary licenses.

===Radio Belgrade (1929–1958)===
Radio Belgrade began its broadcasts in 1929. The first news announcer in 1929 was Jelena Bilbija. The first radio program in Serbia was broadcast in February 1929, when released radio signal was transmitted from the transmitter in Belgrade suburb of Rakovica. After five years, on 24 March 1929 Radio Belgrade began its regular broadcasting program, with art music.

===Radio Television Belgrade (1958–1991)===
Radio Television Belgrade (RTB), consisting of Radio Belgrade and Television Belgrade (TVB) was established as a result of the decision by the Executive Council of the Socialist Republic of Serbia on 13 February 1958. This came after the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&#x27;s government decision of 1956 to invest in a television network.

The first televised broadcast was on 23 August 1958, an edition of the &quot;Dnevnik&quot; (Journal) news programme with Miloje Orlović, Branislav Surutka, Olga Nađ, Olivera Živković and Vera Milovanović. The first RTB program was broadcast from the Belgrade Fair and from a new TV Studio build there. From 1961, RTS began to use quadruplex video tape recording equipment. The Sixties saw dramatic development in all genres of TV programs. TVB became famous by its sitcoms, directed and written by Radivoje-Lola Djukić, Novak Novak and others (only a small proportion is preserved, owing to implicit censorship and shortage of tapes). Also, TVB had excellent documentary programs (series &quot;Karavan&quot;, &quot;Reflektor&quot; and others) and quizzes. By 1970, the entire territory of Serbia was covered by the RTS signal. On 31 December 1971, TVB started broadcasting in PAL color system on its second network. A new AM (radio) broadcast equipment in Zvečka, Obrenovac, with 2000 kW transmitter was erected in 1976.

After the political turmoil in the 1970s (against the &quot;liberals&quot;) the program of RTB became more sterile, however, in the 1980s it reached the zenith.

In 1989, preparation for the formation of the RTS system officially began. That same year, 3K TVB started broadcasting as the youth, alternative TV channel. Along with it, Radio 101 started broadcasting in Belgrade and Vojvodina. Radio 101 was the more commercial youth radio, carrying pop and turbo-folk hits. It was intended to complement the more alternative Belgrade 202.

In 1990, a few regional studios (Niš, Kragujevac, Jagodina, Šabac) officially started broadcasting regional programming via a window in place of &quot;Beogradska hronika&quot;.

In 1991, all public broadcasters within Serbia began the formation of the RTS network system by merging their stations and programming direction to RTB, which served as flagship of the RTS network.

===Radio Television of Serbia (1990s)===

During the March 1991 anti-war demonstrations in Belgrade, the protesters issued a series of demands, one of which was the sacking of RTB&#x27;s general director, Dušan Mitević. The Yugoslav government eventually relented and removed Mitević from his position at RTB. On 8 October 1991, four RTB journalists were killed on the Glina–Petrinja road, in central Croatia, while covering Yugoslavia&#x27;s civil war.

RTS was established in 1992 with the merger of RTB and regional networks Radio-Television Novi Sad and Radio-Television Priština into a true national network. All transmitters, relay stations, antennas and other television equipment once owned by these broadcasters were inherited by RTS. As Yugoslavia disintegrated, RTS&#x27;s journalistic standards plummeted. During the Siege of Dubrovnik, RTS claimed that smoke rising from the city&#x27;s Old Town was the result of automobile tires set on fire by locals. During the Siege of Sarajevo, RTS newscasts showed an image of Sarajevo from the 1980s, untouched, thereby downplaying the severity of the siege. As the wars dragged on, the Yugoslav government began terminating the employment of many dissenting journalists. By January 1993, nearly 1,300 RTS employees – amounting to one-third of the broadcaster&#x27;s pre-war workforce – had been fired.

RTS was active during the Kosovo War and the concurrent NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. On 20 April, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Wesley Clark, ordered that RTS was to be bombed off the air. NATO missiles struck RTS at 2:06 a.m on 23 April. Serbia&#x27;s Minister of Information, Aleksandar Vučić, who would become Prime Minister in 2014 and President in 2017, scheduled to appear on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; from RTS&#x27;s headquarters at 2:30 a.m., narrowly escaped the bombing. Sixteen RTS employees were killed and an additional 16 were injured. The human rights organization Amnesty International condemned the attack and described it as a war crime. NATO officials stated that the alliance considered RTS a legitimate target because of its &quot;biased and distorted coverage&quot; of the war. The bombing temporarily forced RTS off the air, but it resumed broadcasting several hours later, and continued to do so for the rest of the conflict.

Most of RTS&#x27;s headquarters was reconstructed after the war, but part of it was left in ruins as a memorial to those killed. The victims of the bombing were later memorialized by the () monument in Belgrade&#x27;s Tašmajdan Park. In 2002, Dragoljub Milanović, the general manager of RTS, was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years&#x27; imprisonment for failing to evacuate the broadcaster&#x27;s headquarters despite repeated threats by NATO officials that it would be bombed.

===Radio Television of Serbia (2000s)===

After Milošević&#x27;s removal from power, RTS underwent reconstruction in order to regain respect amongst much of its audience which the network had lost during the &#x27;90s. Particular emphasis was put on news programming which suffered greatly during the 1990s. In 2006 RTS became the most viewed television network in Serbia and has retained this position since then. Early that year, RTS decided to shut down one of its television channels. &quot;3K&quot; (Treći kanal RTS-a) was a channel dedicated to the youth, which, however, became the main film, series and sports channel in the late 1990s and the early 2000s.

In 2007, the BBC World Service Trust launched an extensive training programme at Serbia&#x27;s national broadcaster. This 30-month project, which was funded by the European Union, provided extensive journalism, craft and management training to all levels of staff at the broadcaster.

In 2008, RTS underwent major changes as it celebrated 50 years of existence. The network launched its digital network which uses DTT Digital terrestrial television via several DVB-T transmitters. It has also invested millions in new technology. The new high-definition television system was first put in place in May for the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest while on 26 November 2008, RTS began airing its new channel ‘&#x27;RTS Culture and Arts&#x27;’ which is a DTT-only channel, transmitted in 16:9 standard definition format, with stereo and 5.1 digital audio. During 2008 the networks web presentations was greatly improved. On 23 August 2008, the 50th anniversary of &quot;Dnevnik&quot; (the RTS news bulletin) was celebrated. A special edition of the 19:30 &quot;Dnevnik&quot; was aired with Mića Orlović, the first newsreader to host the news in Serbia, hosted the special addition helped by Dušanka Kalanj, the first female newsreader in Serbia. The theme of the evening&#x27;s news included a reflection on the past 50 years a projection of the future as well as the news of the day. The weather was read out by Kamenko Katić, the first weather forecaster. All babies born on 23 August 2008, received a flat screen television set from RTS. On 9 September 2009, at 21:00 CET, RTS launched its first high definition channel – RTS HD.

RTS was the host broadcaster of the semi-final and finals of the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. Serbia gained the rights to host the contest after Marija Šerifović&#x27;s 2007 victory in Helsinki, Finland. The Eurovision Song Contest 2008 was held in Belgrade. RTS broadcast the event as usual (since 2004) on RTS1. The host couple were Jovana Janković and Željko Joksimović. The rating of the final of Eurovision was overwhelming with 4,560,000 people tuning in to watch making it the most watched event on Serbian television as well as on RTS.

===Radio Television of Serbia (2010s)===
In 2011, RTS issued a written apology to the citizens of Serbia and former Yugoslavia for its actions during the regime of Slobodan Milošević and the break up of Yugoslavia. The letter apologises for the network&#x27;s senseless reporting and the hurt it caused to the public. It vows &quot;never to let history repeat itself.&quot;

On 23 August 2014, at the 56th anniversary of the broadcaster, RTS got a new visual identity: focusing on new on-screen logos introduced on 18 February for their terrestrial channels. At the same day, the watermarks changed themselves to fit into the 16:9 format.

Since the entry of the Serbian Progressive Party and Aleksandar Vučić to power after 2012, RTS has been regularly accused of being biased in favor of the incumbent SNS government and against the opposition. Multiple reports have indicated that the state broadcasting service and its Vojvodinian counterpart have given disproportionate time to the government and pro-government voices during election campaigning. The opposition has called for resignations from the board of the Regulatory Authority for Electronic Media and the Radio Television of Serbia during anti-government protests.

<text>Necros was an early American hardcore punk band from Maumee, Ohio, although they are usually identified with the Detroit music scene. They were the first band to record for Touch and Go Records.

==History==
Necros was formed in mid-1979 by then-teenagers Barry Henssler (vocals), Andy Wendler (guitar), and Todd Swalla (drums). After going through a handful of bassists (including Donny Brook, Jeff Allsop, David Cooke, Brian Hyland, Jeff Lake, and Brian Pollack), Corey Rusk joined the band. Barry Henssler had struck up a friendship with Tesco Vee and Dave Stimson of &quot;Touch and Go&quot; magazine after sending them a copy of his own &#x27;zine, &quot;Smegma Journal&quot;. Vee and Stimson became fans and put out the band&#x27;s first record, a self-titled 4-song 7-inch EP (recorded prior to Rusk joining) most commonly known as &quot;Sex Drive&quot;. This was Touch and Go Records&#x27; (then spelled &quot;Rekords&quot;) first release and was limited to only 100 copies.

Andy Wendler left the band in 1981 (although he continued to write for them) and Brian Pollack joined on guitar. Later that year, the band recorded and released another self-titled 7-inch record known as &quot;IQ32&quot;, produced by Minor Threat vocalist Ian MacKaye. This nine-song effort was jointly released by Touch and Go (which Rusk now had a hand in running) and MacKaye&#x27;s own Dischord Records. Wendler rejoined on guitar in late 1982 and, in 1983, the band recorded and released two more records, a 7-inch and LP both titled &quot;Conquest For Death&quot;.

Early on, Necros played with many prominent punk bands, including Black Flag, Bad Brains, Sonic Youth, Minor Threat, and Tesco Vee&#x27;s group The Meatmen. Necros also toured as openers for horror punk band the Misfits, including at the Misfits&#x27; last show in which Todd Swalla stepped in to play drums when Misfits drummer Brian Damage became too drunk to perform.

In 1983, Corey Rusk quit the group to concentrate on Touch and Go, after assuming full control of the label and bassist Ron Sakowski stepped in. Despite the group&#x27;s steady output at their onset, the band did not release another record for two years. In an interview with &quot;One Solution&quot; zine, vocalist Barry Henssler blamed the delay between releases on Rusk&#x27;s refusal to give the band a definite answer as to whether or not they were still on Touch and Go. The label has since deleted their Necros releases from their catalogue.

The next Necros release came in 1985 as a split LP with White Flag entitled &quot;Jail Jello&quot;, on Gasatanka Records. Now featuring a more distinctly post-hardcore sound, the band followed up the split with 1986&#x27;s &quot;Tangled Up&quot; LP on Restless Records, along with a single of the same name on Gasatanka. After spending 1987 touring, first with Megadeth and then later the Circle Jerks, the group called it quits. A live album, &quot;Live or Else&quot;, appeared posthumously in 1989.

==Post break up==
Barry Henssler went on to form the band Big Chief, who recorded for the Sub Pop label. Ron Sakowski and Todd Swalla reunited in the mid 1990s as part of the final line up of Touch and Go artists Laughing Hyenas. Andy Wendler played in a group called Gone In Sixty Seconds (also known as G.I.S.S.).

In 2002, a limited (only 450 copies pressed) split 10-inch with Authority Abuse was released by Wise Hoodlum Records featuring live Necros recordings from 1981–1983. The band&#x27;s first demo was reissued as the &quot;Ambionic Sound&quot; 7-inch in 2012, named for the studio where it was recorded.

In 2005 Rykodisc reissued &quot;Tangled Up&quot; and &quot;Live or Else&quot; together on one CD, currently the only Necros material available on CD.

<doc id="577446" wikidata="Q425319" url="?curid=577446" title="Satellite DNA">
<text>Satellite DNA consists of very large arrays of tandemly repeating, non-coding DNA. Satellite DNA is the main component of functional centromeres, and form the main structural constituent of heterochromatin.

The name &quot;satellite DNA&quot; refers to the phenomenon that repetitions of a short DNA sequence tend to produce a different frequency of the bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, and thus have a different density from bulk DNA such that they form a second or &quot;satellite&quot; band(s) when genomic DNA is separated along a cesium chloride density gradient using buoyant density centrifugation.
Sequences with a greater ratio of A+T display a lower density while those with a greater ratio of G+C display a higher density than the bulk of genomic DNA. Some repetitive sequences are ~50% G+C/A+T and thus have buoyant densities the same as bulk genomic DNA. These satellites are called &quot;cryptic&quot; satellites because they form a band hidden within the main band of genomic DNA. &quot;Isopycnic&quot; is another term used for cryptic satellites.

==Satellite DNA families in humans==
Satellite DNA, together with minisatellite and microsatellite DNA, constitute the tandem repeats. The size of satellite DNA arrays varies greatly between individuals.

The major satellite DNA families in humans are called:

==Length==
A repeated pattern can be between 1 base pair (bp) long (a mononucleotide repeat) to several thousand base pairs long, and the total size of a satellite DNA block can be several megabases without interruption. Long repeat units have been described containing domains of shorter repeated segments and mononucleotides (1-5 bp), arranged in clusters of microsatellites, wherein differences among individual copies of the longer repeat units were clustered. Most satellite DNA is localized to the telomeric or the centromeric region of the chromosome. The nucleotide sequence of the repeats is fairly well conserved across species. However, variation in the length of the repeat is common. 

Low-resolution sequencing-based studies have demonstrated variation in human population satellite array lengths as well as in the frequency of certain sequence and structural variations (11–13, 29). However, due to a lack of full centromere assemblies, base-level understanding of satellite array variation and evolution has remained weak. For example, minisatellite DNA is a short region (1-5 kb) of repeating elements with length &gt;9 nucleotides. Whereas microsatellites in DNA sequences are considered to have a length of 1-8 nucleotides. The difference in how many of the repeats is present in the region (length of the region) is the basis for DNA profiling.

==Origin==
Microsatellites are thought to have originated by polymerase slippage during DNA replication. This comes from the observation that microsatellite alleles usually are length polymorphic; specifically, the length differences observed between microsatellite alleles are generally multiples of the repeat unit length.

==Structure==
Satellite DNA adopts higher-order three-dimensional structures in a naturally occurring complex satellite DNA from the land crab &quot;Gecarcinus lateralis&quot;, whose genome contains 3% of a GC-rich satellite band consisting of a ~2100 bp &quot;repeat unit&quot; sequence motif called RU. The RU was arranged in long tandem arrays with approximately 16,000 copies per genome. Several RU sequences were cloned and sequenced to reveal conserved regions of conventional DNA sequences over stretches greater than 550 bp, interspersed with five &quot;divergent domains&quot; within each copy of RU.

Four divergent domains consisted of microsatellite repeats, biased in base composition, with purines on one strand and pyrimidines on the other. Some contained mononucleotide repeats of C:G base pairs approximately 20 bp in length. These strand-biased microsatellite domains ranged in length from approximately 20 bp to greater than 250 bp. The most prevalent repeated sequences in the embedded microsatellite regions were CT:AG, CCT:AGG, CCCT:AGGG, and CGCAC:GTGCG These repeating sequences were shown to adopt altered structures including triple-stranded DNA, Z-DNA, stem-loop, and other conformations under superhelical stress.

Between the strand-biased microsatellite repeats and C:G mononucleotide repeats, all sequence variations retained one or two base pairs with A (purine) interrupting the pyrimidine-rich strand and T (pyrimidine) interrupting the purine-rich strand. These interruptions in compositional bias adopted highly distorted conformations as shown by their response to structrural nuclease enzymes including S1, P1, and mung bean nucleases.

The most complex compositionally-biased microsatellite domain of RU included the sequence TTAA:TTAA as well as a mirror repeat. It produced the strongest signal in response to nucleases compared to all other altered structures in experimental observations. That particular strand-biased divergent domain was subcloned and its altered helical structure was studied in greater detail.

A fifth divergent domain in the RU sequence was characterized by variations of a symmetrical DNA sequence motif of alternating purines and pyrimidines shown to adopt a left-handed Z-DNA or stem-loop structure under superhelical stress. The conserved symmetrical Z-DNA was abbreviated Z4Z5NZ15NZ5Z4, where Z represents alternating purine/pyrimidine sequences. A stem-loop structure was centered in the Z15 element at the highly conserved palindromic sequence CGCACGTGCG:CGCACGTGCG and was flanked by extended palindromic Z-DNA sequences over a 35 bp region. Many RU variants showed deletions of at least 10 bp outside the Z4Z5NZ15NZ5Z4 structural element, while others had additional Z-DNA sequences lengthening the alternating purine and pyrimidine domain to over 50 bp.

One extended RU sequence (EXT) was shown to have six tandem copies of a 142 bp amplified (AMPL) sequence motif inserted into a region bordered by inverted repeats where most copies contained just one AMPL sequence element. There were no nuclease-sensitive altered structures or significant sequence divergence in the relatively conventional AMPL sequence. A truncated RU sequence (TRU), 327 bp shorter than most clones, arose from a single base change leading to a second EcoRI restriction site in TRU.

Another crab, the hermit crab &quot;Pagurus pollicaris&quot;, was shown to have a family of AT-rich satellites with inverted repeat structures that comprised 30% of the entire genome. Another cryptic satellite from the same crab with the sequence CCTA:TAGG
was found inserted into some of the palindromes.

<text>Ali Akbar Khan (14 April 192218 June 2009) was an Indian Hindustani classical musician of the Maihar gharana, known for his virtuosity in playing the sarod. Trained as a classical musician and instrumentalist by his father, Allauddin Khan, he also composed numerous classical &quot;ragas&quot; and film scores. He established a music school in Calcutta in 1956, and the Ali Akbar College of Music in 1967, which moved with him to the United States and is now based in San Rafael, California, with a branch in Basel, Switzerland.

Khan was instrumental in popularizing Indian classical music in the West, both as a performer and as a teacher. He first came to America in 1955 on the invitation of violinist Yehudi Menuhin and later settled in California. He was a adjunct professor of music at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Khan was accorded India&#x27;s second highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan, in 1989. Nominated five times for the Grammy Award, Khan was also a recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship and the National Endowment for the Arts&#x27; National Heritage Fellowship.

==Childhood and training==
Ali Akbar Khan was born in the village of Shibpur, Brahmanbaria, in present-day Bangladesh, to musician and teacher, Allauddin Khan and Madina Begum. Soon after his birth, Khan&#x27;s family returned to Maihar (in present-day Madhya Pradesh, India) where his father was the primary court musician for the Maharaja of the princely state.

From an early age Khan received training from his father in various instruments as well as vocal composition, but finally gravitated towards the sarod. Allauddin was a perfectionist and a strict taskmaster, and Khan&#x27;s lessons started before dawn and often lasted 18 hours a day. Khan also learned to play the tabla and the pakhavaj from his uncle, Aftabuddin Khan, who he visited at Shibpur. During this period he met several prominent musicians, such as the sarodist Timir Baran and flautist Pannalal Ghosh, who came to study with his father; in later years he was joined in his lessons by his sister Annapurna Devi, who became an accomplished player of the surbahar, and fellow student Ravi Shankar. Shankar and Annapurna Devi were married in 1941.

Of his training on the sarod, he wrote:
==Career==

Khan, after years of rigorous training, gave his debut performance at a music conference in Allahabad in 1936, at the age of 13. Three years later, in December 1939, he accompanied Ravi Shankar on the sarod during the latter&#x27;s debut performance at the same conference; this was the first of many &quot;jugalbandis&quot; (duets) between the two musicians. In 1938 Khan gave his first recital on All India Radio (AIR), Bombay (accompanied on the tabla by Alla Rakha), and starting in January 1940, he gave monthly performances on AIR, Lucknow. Finally in 1944, both Shankar and Khan left Maihar to start their professional careers as musicians; Shankar went to Bombay, while Khan became the youngest music director for AIR, Lucknow, and was responsible for solo performances and composing for the radio orchestra.

In 1943, on his father&#x27;s recommendation, Khan was appointed a court musician for the Maharaja of Jodhpur, Umaid Singh. There, he taught and composed music besides giving recitals and was accorded the title of &quot;Ustad&quot; by the Maharaja. When the princely states were wound down with India&#x27;s independence in 1947 and Maharaja Hanwant Singh died in a plane crash in 1952, Khan moved to Bombay.

In Bombay, he won acclaim as a composer of several film scores, including Chetan Anand&#x27;s &quot;Aandhiyan&quot; (1952). Lata Mangeshkar sang the title song, &quot;Har Kahin Pe Shaadmani&quot; and as a token of her respect to sarod maestro, did not charge any fee. This was followed by Satyajit Ray&#x27;s &quot;Devi&quot; (1960), Merchant-Ivory&#x27;s &quot;The Householder&quot;, and Tapan Sinha&#x27;s &quot;Khudito Pashan&quot; (&quot;Hungry Stones&quot;, 1960), for which he won the &quot;Best Musician of the Year&quot; award. He also played sarod for a song in 1955 film &quot;Seema&quot; which had the music composed by Shankar Jaikishan. Later in 1993, he would score some of the music for Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Little Buddha&quot;.

Beginning in 1945, Khan also started recording a series of 78 rpm disks (which could record about three minutes of music) at the HMV Studios in Bombay. For one such record he conceived a new composition &quot;Raga Chandranandan&quot; (&quot;moonstruck&quot;), based on four evening ragas, Malkauns, Chandrakauns, Nandakauns and Kaushi Kanada. This record was a huge success in India, and the raga found a worldwide audience, when a 22-minute rendition was re-recorded for the &quot;Master Musician of India&quot; LP in 1965 − one of Khan&#x27;s seminal recordings.

He performed in India and traveled extensively in the West. In 1956, Khan founded the Ali Akbar College of Music in Calcutta, with the mission to teach and spread Indian classical music. He founded another school of the same name in Berkeley, California in 1967 and later moved it to San Rafael, California. Khan performed in Boston with Shankar Ghosh in 1969 for the Peabody Mason Concert series. In 1985 he founded another branch of the Ali Akbar College of Music in Basel, Switzerland. Khan was the first Indian musician to record an LP album of Indian classical music in the United States and to play sarod on American television.

Khan has participated in a number of classic jugalbandi pairings, most notably with Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee and violinist L. Subramaniam. A few recordings of duets with Vilayat Khan also exist. He also collaborated with Western musicians; he taught Grateful Dead drummers Mickey Hart and, by extension, Bill Kreutzmann. In August 1971, Khan performed at Madison Square Garden for the Concert for Bangladesh, along with Ravi Shankar, Alla Rakha and Kamala Chakravarty; other musicians at the concert included George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr. A live album and a movie of the event were later released.

==Personal life==
Khan was married three times and had at least 11 children, including sarod players Aashish Khan, Alam Khan, and Manik Khan.

Khan was based in the United States for the last four decades of his life. He toured extensively until he was prevented from doing so by ill health. He had been a dialysis patient since 2004. He died from kidney failure at his home in San Anselmo, California on 18 June 2009, at age 87.

==Awards==
Khan was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1967 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1989, among other awards. He received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1991, the first Indian musician to receive the so-called &quot;genius grant&quot;. In 1997, Khan received the National Endowment for the Arts&#x27; prestigious National Heritage Fellowship, the United States&#x27; highest honour in the traditional arts. Khan received five Grammy nominations over the course of his life. In September 2014, a postage stamp featuring Khan was released by India Post commemorating his contributions.

<text>In electrical engineering and telecommunications, the center frequency of a filter or channel is a measure of a central frequency between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies. It is usually defined as either the arithmetic mean or the geometric mean of the lower cutoff frequency and the upper cutoff frequency of a band-pass system or a band-stop system.

Typically, the geometric mean is used in systems based on certain transformations of lowpass filter designs, where the frequency response is constructed to be symmetric on a logarithmic frequency scale. The geometric center frequency corresponds to a mapping of the DC response of the prototype lowpass filter, which is a resonant frequency sometimes equal to the peak frequency of such systems, for example as in a Butterworth filter.

The arithmetic definition is used in more general situations, such as in describing passband telecommunication systems, where filters are not necessarily symmetric but are treated on a linear frequency scale for applications such as frequency-division multiplexing.

<text>Rāmtanu ( – 26 April 1589), popularly referred to as Mian Tānsen (), or Sangeet Samrāt (), was a Hindustani classical musician. Born into a Hindu Gaur Brahmin family in Gwalior, he learnt and perfected his art in the northwest region of modern Madhya Pradesh. He got his first break as musician and composer in the court of Raja Man Singh Tomar of Gwalior and spent most of his adult life in the court and patronage of the Hindu king of Rewa, Raja Ramchandra Singh (r. 1555–1592), where Tānsen&#x27;s musical abilities and studies gained widespread fame. This reputation brought him to the attention of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, who sent messengers to Raja Ramchandra Singh, requesting Tānsen to join the musicians at the Mughal court. Tansen did not want to go, but Rāja Ramchandra Singh encouraged him to gain a wider audience and sent him along with gifts for Akbar. In 1562, at about the age of 60, the Vaishnav musician Tānsen joined Akbar&#x27;s court, and his performances became the subject of many court historians.

Numerous legends have been written about Tānsen, mixing facts and fiction, and the historicity of these stories is doubtful. Akbar considered him one of the Navaratnas Nine Ministers (the nine jewels) and gave him the title Mian, an honorific, meaning learned man.

Tānsen was a composer, musician and vocalist, to whom many compositions have been attributed in northern regions of the Indian subcontinent. He was also an instrumentalist who popularized and improved musical instruments. He is among the most influential personalities in the North Indian tradition of Indian classical music, called &quot;Hindustani&quot;. His 16th-century studies in music and compositions inspired many, and he is considered by numerous North Indian &quot;gharana&quot; (regional music schools) to be their lineage founder.

Tānsen is remembered for his epic Dhrupad compositions, creating several new &quot;rāgs&quot;, as well as for writing two classic books on music, &quot;Sri Ganesh Stotra&quot; and &quot;Sangita Sara&quot;.

==Early life==
Tansen&#x27;s date of birth is unclear, but most sources place his birth about 1493 CE, or between 1493 and 1506. His biography is also unclear and many conflicting accounts exist, with some common elements. Historical facts about Tansen are difficult to extract from the extensive and contradictory legends that surround him.

According to the common elements in the various stories, Tansen&#x27;s name as a child was Ramtanu. His father Mukund Ram (also known as Mukund Gaud or Mukund Chand) was a wealthy poet and accomplished musician of Gwalior, who for some time was a Hindu temple priest in Varanasi. According to some versions of the story, it is believed that Tansen was born profoundly mute and did not speak until the age of 5.

Tansen learnt and perfected his art in the city of Gwalior, in modern-day Madhya Pradesh. He began his career from the Imperial Court of Gwalior Kingdom and spent most of his adult life in the court and patronage of the Hindu king of Rewa, Raja Ramchandra Singh, where Tansen&#x27;s musical abilities and studies gained him widespread fame and following. He was a close confidant of Raja Ramchandra Singh, and they used to make music together. Tansen&#x27;s reputation brought him to the attention of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, who sent messengers to Raja Ramchandra Singh, requesting Tansen to join the musicians at the Mughal court. Tansen initially refused to go and sought to retire instead into solitude, but Raja Ramchandra Singh sent him to Akbar&#x27;s court. In 1562, about the age of sixty, Tansen who was still a Vaishnava musician, arrived for the first time in Akbar&#x27;s court.

Tansen&#x27;s influence was central to create the Hindustani classical ethos as we know today. He was instrumental in establishing the very first musical gharana the &quot;Gwalior Gharana&quot;. A number of descendants and disciples trace him to be their lineage founder. Many gharanas (schools) of Hindustani classical music claim some connection to his lineage. To these &quot;gharanas&quot;, Tansen is the founder of Hindustani classical music.

==Schooling==

The legendary oral versions about Tansen&#x27;s early life and schooling particularly differ depending on whether the story has origins in Hindu legends (Vaishnavism) or Muslim legends (Sufism). The Hindu bhakti saint and poet-musician Swami Haridas was the major influence on Tansen. In Islamic biographies, the Sufi Muslim mystic named Muhammad Ghaus is said to have influenced Tansen. According to Bonnie Wade – a professor of Music specializing in South Asia Studies, Swami Haridas is widely accepted to have been Tansen&#x27;s teacher, and it is clear that Tansen connected with Muhammad Ghaus as well, but the evidence suggests that Tansen is less affiliated with either religion, more with music.

Tansen showed musical talent at the age of 6. At some point, he was discipled to Swami Haridas, for a brief period, the legendary composer from Vrindavan and part of the stellar Gwalior court of Raja Man Singh Tomar (1486–1516 AD), specialising in the Dhrupad style of singing. His talent was recognised early and it was the ruler of Gwalior who conferred upon the maestro the honorific title &#x27;Tansen&#x27;. Haridas was considered to be a legendary music teacher in that time. It is said that Tansen had no equal apart from his teacher. From Haridas, Tansen acquired not only his love for dhrupad but also his interest in compositions in the local language. This was the time when the Bhakti tradition was fomenting a shift from Sanskrit to the local idiom (Brajbhasa and Hindi), and Tansen&#x27;s compositions also highlighted this trend. During some point of his apprenticeship, Tansen&#x27;s father died, and he returned home, where it is said that he used to sing at a local Shiva temple in Gwalior.

Hagiographies mention that Tansen met the Sufi mystic Muhammad Ghaus. The interaction with Ghaus brought a strong Sufi influence on Tansen. Later in his life, he continued to compose in Brajbhasha invoking traditional motifs such as Krishna and Shiva.

The presence of musicians like Tansen in Akbar&#x27;s court was an attempt to accept and integrate the Hindu and Muslim traditions within the Mughal Empire. Tansen became one of the treasured Navaratnas (lit. &quot;nava&quot;=nine, &quot;ratna&quot;=jewel) of Akbar&#x27;s court. He received the honorific title &quot;Mian&quot; there, and the name Mian Tansen.

=== Compositions ===
Tansen&#x27;s musical compositions covered many themes, and employed Dhrupad. Most of these were derived from the Hindu Puranas, composed in Braj Bhasha, and written in praise of gods and goddesses such as Ganesha, Saraswati, Surya, Shiva, Vishnu (Narayana and Krishna avatar). He also composed and performed compositions dedicated to eulogizing kings and emperor Akbar.
==Family ==
Tansen married to a girl named Hussaini who was from Gwalior, and from this marriage he had four sons and one daughter namely: Surat Sen, Sarat Sen, Tarang Khan, Bilas Khan and Saraswati. All five became proficient musicians of Gwalior in their own right, his daughter Saraswati later married to Misri Singh, a notable veena player and music composer from Singhalgarh, who was the grandson of Raja Samokhan Singh of Kishangarh. One legend states that Tansen had also been married to a daughter of Akbar named Mehrunissa.

==Death==
The year of the death of Tansen, like much of his biography, is unclear. According to one version, written by Islamic historians, Tansen died in 1586 in Delhi, and that Akbar and much of his court attended the funeral procession which was completed according to Muslim customs in Gwalior. Other versions, written in Akbarnama, written by Abul Fazl, as well as by Hindu historians give 26 April 1589 as the date of his death and that his funeral observed mostly Hindu customs. Scholars states reason to refute the viewpoint of Tansen being converted to Islam due to his belief on Hindu Tradition and various composition on Hindu God. However, his composition shows no trace of Islamic influence. Tansen&#x27;s remains were buried in the mausoleum complex of his Sufi master Shaikh Muhammad Ghaus in Gwalior. Every year in December, an annual festival, the &quot;Tansen Samaroh&quot;, is held in Gwalior to celebrate Tansen life and legacy.

==Popular culture==
Several Hindi films have been made on Tansen&#x27;s life, with mostly anecdotal story lines. Some of them are &quot;Tansen&quot; (1943), a musical hit produced by Ranjit Movietone, starring K. L. Saigal and Khursheed Bano. &quot;Tansen&quot; (1958) and &quot;Sangeet Samrat Tansen&quot; (1962). Tansen is also a central character, though remaining mostly in the backdrop, in the historical musical &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot; (1952), based on the life of his eponymous contemporary.

==Legacy==
===Tansen award===

A national music festival known as &#x27;Tansen Samaroh&#x27; is held every year in December, near the tomb of Tansen at Hazira, Gwalior as a mark of respect to his memory. The Tansen Samman or Tansen award is given away to exponents in Hindustani Classical music.

===Buildings===
The fort at Fatehpur Sikri is strongly associated with Tansen&#x27;s tenure at Akbar&#x27;s court. Near the emperor&#x27;s chambers, a pond was built on a small island in the middle, where musical performances were given. Today, this tank, called &quot;Anup Talao&quot;, can be seen near the public audience hall &quot;Diwan-i-Aam&quot; – a central platform reachable via four footbridges. It is said that Tansen would perform different ragas at different times of day, and the emperor and his select audience would honour him with coins. Tansen&#x27;s supposed residence is also nearby.

===Miracles and legends===
The bulk of Tansen&#x27;s biography as found in Akbar court historians&#x27; accounts and &quot;gharana&quot; literature consists of inconsistent and miraculous legends. Among the legends about Tansen are stories of his bringing down the rains with Raga Megh Malhar and lighting lamps by performing Raga Deepak. Raga Megh Malhar is still in the mainstream repertoire, but raga Deepak is no longer known; three different variants exist in the Bilaval (thaat), Poorvi (thaat) and Khamaj (thaat) thaats. It is not clear which, if any, corresponds to the Deepak of Tansen&#x27;s time. Other legends tell of his ability to bring wild animals to listen with attention (or to talk their language). Once, a wild white elephant was captured, but it was fierce and could not be tamed. Finally, Tansen sang to the elephant who calmed down and the emperor was able to ride him. Besides this, there is also the theory of him being the inventor of rabab-a stringed instruments.

===Crater===
A crater on the planet Mercury has been named in Tansen&#x27;s honor.

<text>The Battle of Hedgeley Moor, 25 April 1464, took place during the Wars of the Roses. It was fought at Hedgeley Moor, north of the villages of Glanton and Powburn in Northumberland, between a Yorkist army led by John Neville, Lord Montagu and a Lancastrian army led by Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. The battle ended in a Yorkist victory.

==Background==
At the beginning of 1464, after setbacks in 1463, the Lancastrians were hoping that the Welsh Marches and the West Country would rise in their support. The Yorkists wanted to remove the threat of Scottish invasion, by reaching an agreement with the Scots. The English parliament was due to meet at York on 5 May to discuss terms with a party from Scotland, but a burst of Lancastrian activity in Northumberland and North Yorkshire meant that it would be difficult for the Scottish party to travel safely to York. Lord Montagu was therefore sent north with a small force to escort them to York.

The Duke of Somerset tried to ambush Montagu near Newcastle but the latter was able to evade this attempt. He continued his journey northwards, gathering troops as he went. When Montagu reached Hedgeley Moor he had an army of five or six thousand men. There he met a Lancastrian army of five thousand men commanded by Somerset. The Lancastrian army also included Lords Ros and Hungerford and Sir Ralph Percy.

==Battle==
The battle began with the normal exchange of archery between the two armies.
Montagu (John Neville), then advanced across the 1,500 yards of moorland, only to be forced to halt and readjust his lines when the Lancastrian left flank, under Lords Ros and Hungerford (some 2,000 men), faltered, broke, and scattered.

The whole Lancastrian force gave way when the Yorkists clashed with their line. Pushed back by weight of numbers all but a few of the remaining Lancastrians fled the field. Sir Ralph Percy stayed with his household retainers and made a brave last stand. However, deserted by the rest of the army, including all the other commanders, he was soon slain. As he died he is said to have uttered the enigmatic words: ‘I have saved the bird in my bosom’.

==Aftermath==
The defeat and dispersal of the Lancastrian forces made it possible for the Scottish negotiators to be safely escorted to York, where a peaceful solution between Edward IV&#x27;s Yorkists and the Scots was successfully negotiated. With regard to the Lancastrians, this battle was shortly followed by the decisive Battle of Hexham, on 15 May 1464. 

A square sandstone pillar stands near the site of the battle, and is known as ‘Percy’s Cross’. It can be found on the east side of the A697, a couple of miles north of the village of Powburn. The road at this point is following the line of the Roman road known as the Devil&#x27;s Causeway.

There are two ballads commemorating the battle, &quot;The Battle of Hedgley Moor&quot; by Frederick Sheldon, and &quot;The Legend of Percy&#x27;s Cross&quot; by James Service.

<doc id="577471" wikidata="Q848162" url="?curid=577471" title="Pew">
<text>A pew () is a long bench seat or enclosed box, used for seating members of a congregation or choir in a church, funeral home or sometimes a courtroom. Occasionally, they are also found in live performance venues (such as the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, which was formerly a church). In Christian churches of the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican traditions, kneelers are an essential part of the pew, that are used during various parts of the liturgy.

==Overview==


The first backless stone benches began to appear in English churches in the thirteenth century, originally placed against the walls of the nave. Over time, they were brought into the centre of the room, first as moveable furniture and later fixed to the floor. Wooden benches replaced the stone ones from the fourteenth century and became common in the fifteenth.

Churches were not commonly furnished with permanent pews before the Protestant Reformation. The rise of the sermon as a central act of Christian worship, especially in Protestantism, made the pew a standard item of church furniture. Hence the use or avoidance of pews could be used as a test of the high or low character of a Protestant church: describing a mid-19th century conflict between Henry Edward Manning and Archdeacon Hare, Lytton Strachey remarks with characteristic irony, &quot;Manning had been removing the high pews from the church in Brighton, and putting in open benches in their place. Everyone knew what that meant; everyone knew that the high pew was one of the bulwarks of Protestantism, and that an open bench had upon it the taint of Rome&quot;.

In some churches, pews were installed at the expense of the congregants, and were their personal property; there was no general public seating in the church itself. In these churches, &quot;pew deeds&quot; recorded title to the pews, and were used to convey them. Pews were originally purchased from the church by their owners under this system, and the purchase price of the pews went to the costs of building the church. When the pews were privately owned, their owners sometimes enclosed them in lockable pew boxes, and the ownership of pews was sometimes controversial, as in the case of B. T. Roberts: a notice that the pews were to be free in perpetuity was sometimes erected as a condition of building grants.

Certain areas of the church were considered to be more desirable than others, as they might offer a better view of services or, indeed, might make a certain family or person more prominent or visible to their neighbours during these services. During the late medieval and early modern period, attendance at church was legally compulsory, so the allocation of a church&#x27;s pews offered a public visualisation of the social hierarchy within the whole parish. At this time many pews had been handed down through families from one generation to the next. Alternatively, wealthier inhabitants often expected more prestigious seating in reward for contribution to the material upkeep of the church, such as the erection of galleries. Disputes over pew ownership were not uncommon.

Pews are generally made of wood and arranged in rows facing the altar in the nave of a church. Usually a pathway is left between pews in the center to allow for a procession; some have benchlike cushioned seating, and hassocks or footrests, although more traditional, conservative churches usually have neither cushions nor footrests. Many pews have slots behind each pew to hold Bibles, prayer books, hymnals or other church literature. Sometimes the church may also provide stations on certain rows that allow the hearing-impaired to use headsets in order to hear the sermon. In many churches pews are permanently attached to the floor, or to a wooden platform.

In churches with a tradition of public kneeling prayer (such as the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican denominations), pews are often equipped with kneelers in front of the seating bench so members of the congregation can kneel on them instead of the floor. These kneelers essentially have long, usually padded boards which run lengthwise parallel to the seating bench of the pew. These kneeler boards may be 15 cm or so wide and elevated perhaps 10–15 cm above the floor, but dimensions can vary widely. Permanently attached kneelers are often made so they can be rotated or otherwise moved up out of the way when the congregation members are not kneeling.

Due to the prominence in European culture and usefulness, the usage of the pew has spread to many courtrooms in Europe and has additionally spread to Jewish synagogues due to trends of modelling synagogues similar to churches in Western Europe. In most old churches the family names are carved into the end of the pew to show who sat there but in some bigger cases the name of a village was carved into the end and only one person from every village came to mass every week.

==Pew rents==

Until the early/mid twentieth century, it was common practice in Anglican, Catholic, and Presbyterian churches to rent pews in churches to families or individuals as a principal means of raising income. This was especially common in the United States where churches lacked government support through mandatory tithing. This enforced and demonstrated social standing within a parish.
Pew rental emerged as a source of controversy in the 1840s and 1850s, especially in the Church of England. The legal status of pew rents was, in many cases, questionable. Further, it exacerbated a problem with a lack of accommodation in churches that had been noted already in the 1810s, especially in London, and in particular by Richard Yates in his pamphlet &quot;The Church in Danger&quot; (1815) with his estimate of over 950,000 people who could not afford to worship in a parish church. St Philip&#x27;s Clerkenwell, a Commissioners&#x27; church, was the first London church to break with pew rents.

William James Conybeare commented on the pew system in his &quot;Church Parties&quot; article in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; of 1853, stating that it was the Anglicans who had adopted the slogan &quot;Equality within the House of God&quot;. The early 19th century Commissioners&#x27; churches were only required to offer 20% free seating. Attitudes changed from the 1840s, with the High Church party turning against paid pews. By the 1860s and 1870s that view had become quite orthodox, and was supported vocally by Frederic William Farrar.

Many Anglo-Catholic parishes were founded at this time as &quot;free and open churches&quot; characterized by their lack of pew rentals. In mid-century reforms, pews were on occasion removed from English churches to discourage rental practices. The Free and Open Church Association was founded in 1866 by Samuel Ralph Townshend Mayer.

<text>Eva Herzigová (; born 10 March 1973) is a Czech model and actress. Her career took a major turn in 1994 when she became the face of the Wonderbra campaign. The famous &quot;Hello Boys&quot; ad became iconic and contributed to her worldwide popularity. Her height () and elegant appearance made her a sought-after model for fashion shows and campaigns of various renowned brands. Throughout her career, Herzigová has worked with leading designers and fashion houses including Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Chanel, Versace, Louis Vuitton and many others and has appeared on the covers of many prestigious fashion magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot; and many others. She became one of the prominent figures of the 1990s modeling and was one of the so-called supermodels along with other famous names such as Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer and Christy Turlington.

In addition to her modeling career, Herzigová has also appeared in film and television. She has starred in films such as &quot;Les Anges gardiens&quot; (1995) along Gérard Depardieu and Christian Clavier, &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1998), &quot;Modigliani&quot; (2004) and &quot;A Prominent Patient&quot; (2017).

Her career as a model and her presence in public space have won her numerous awards and accolades. Eva Herzigova remains a major figure in the fashion and entertainment industry.

==Early life and career==
Herzigová was born in Litvínov, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic), the daughter of an accountant mother and an electrician father. Growing up, Herzigová was athletic, &quot;excelling in gymnastics, basketball, track and cross-country skiing.&quot; She began her modeling career at the age of 16 after winning a modeling contest organized by the French modeling agency &quot;Metropolitan Models&quot; in Prague in 1989, before she moved to Paris.
After arriving in Paris, her popularity increased. Her first important appearance was as the model for the first Wonderbra campaign. In 1994, advertising executive Trevor Beattie, working for TBWA/London, developed an ad for Sara Lee&#x27;s &quot;Hello Boys&quot; Wonderbra campaign. It featured a close-up image of Herzigová wearing a black Wonderbra. The ad used only two words: &quot;Hello boys.&quot; The influential poster was featured in an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and it was voted in at number 10 in a &quot;Poster of the Century&quot; contest. The Canada-based lingerie fashion label wanted the ad campaign to motivate women to see the Wonderbra &quot;as a cosmetic and as a beauty enhancer rather than a functional garment&quot;.

<text>All India Radio (AIR), also known as Akashvani (), is India&#x27;s state-owned public radio broadcaster. Founded in 1936, it operates under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and is one of the two divisions of Prasar Bharati. Headquartered at the &quot;Akashvani Bhavan&quot; in New Delhi, it houses the Drama Section, FM Section, and National Service. It also serves as the home of the Indian television station Doordarshan Kendra.

All India Radio is the largest radio network in the world in terms of the number of languages broadcast, the socioeconomic diversity it serves, and the scale of its broadcasting organisation. AIR&#x27;s domestic service includes 420 stations nationwide, covering nearly 92% of India&#x27;s geographic area and 99.19% of its population, with programming available in 23 languages and 179 dialects.
==History==

=== Akashvani ===
When the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS) was renamed to All India Radio, Rabindranath Tagore rechristened it Akashvani, &quot;the voice that comes over from the skies&quot;, in a poem penned for the inauguration of Kolkata&#x27;s shortwave service.

The term Akashvani was also used in the context of radio by M. V. Gopalaswami in 1936 when he established India’s first private radio station at his residence, &quot;Vittal Vihar,&quot; located about 200 yards from the current All India Radio station in Mysore. In 1956, &quot;Akashvani&quot; was adopted as All India Radio&#x27;s on-air name. With its literal meaning in Sanskrit as &quot;voice from the sky,&quot; the name was considered highly fitting for a broadcaster. The suggestion to use &quot;Akashvani&quot; came from the poet Pandit Narendra Sharma.

=== During the British Raj ===
Broadcasting commenced in June 1923 during the British Raj with programmes by the Bombay Presidency Radio Club and other radio clubs. According to an agreement on 23 July 1927, the private Indian Broadcasting Company Ltd (IBC) was authorised to operate two radio stations: the Mumbai station, which began on 23 July 1927, and the Kolkata station, which followed suit on 26 August 1927. The organisation went into liquidation on 1 March 1930. The government took over broadcasting facilities and launched the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS) on April 1, 1930, initially on an experimental basis for two years. It became a permanent service in May 1932 and was later renamed All India Radio on June 8, 1936. The building was contracted by Sir Sobha Singh.
On 1 October 1939, the External Service began with a broadcast in Pashto. It was intended to counter radio propaganda from Germany directed at Afghanistan, Iran, and Arab nations. The Dhaka station in Eastern India, in what is now Bangladesh, opened in 1939. This station catered to and nurtured the pioneers of Bengali intellectuals. The foremost among them, Natyaguru Nurul Momen, became the trailblazer of the talk show in 1939. He wrote and directed the first modern radio play for this station in 1942.

In December 1940, the Standing Finance Committee sanctioned a sum of Rupees 9,30,000 for the establishment of a new headquarters of the All India Radio in Delhi. The new “Broadcasting House” of AIR at Parliament Street in New Delhi was inaugurated in February 1943. In 1956, All India Radio (AIR) was officially renamed &quot;Akashvani&quot;, and its headquarters were renamed &quot;Akashvani Bhawan&quot;.

=== After Independence ===
When India became independent in 1947, the All India Radio network consisted of only six stations: Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Lucknow, and Tiruchirappalli. The three radio stations in Lahore, Peshawar, and Dhaka remained in what eventually became Pakistan after the partition. At that time, there were approximately 250,000 radio sets in India.

In August 1947, All India Radio hired its first female newsreader, Saeeda Bano, who read the news in Urdu. 

On October 3, 1957, the Vividh Bharati service was launched by All India Radio to compete with Radio Ceylon. Television broadcasting commenced in Delhi in 1959 under the aegis of AIR, but was split off from the radio network as &quot;Doordarshan&quot; on 1 April 1976. FM broadcasting began on 23 July 1977 in Chennai, and expanded during the 1990s.

Deccan Radio (Nizam Radio 1932), the first radio station in the princely Hyderabad State (now Hyderabad), went live on 3 February 1935. It was launched by Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad, boasting of a transmitting power of 200 Watts. On 1 April 1950, after Operation Polo, Deccan Radio was taken over by the Indian Government, and in 1956, it was merged with All India Radio. Thereafter, it has been known as AIR-Hyderabad (100 kW).

==Domestic services==
AIR offers a variety of services in multiple languages, each catering to different regions across India.

===Vividh Bharati===
Vividh Bharati, launched in 1957, is one of the most well-known services of All India Radio. Its name roughly translates to &quot;Diverse Indian&quot; and is also referred to as the Commercial Broadcasting Service (CBS). Commercially, it is the most accessible AIR network, particularly popular in Mumbai and other large cities. Vividh Bharati offers a wide range of programs, including news, film music, short plays, music, and comedy. It operates on various mediumwave and FM frequencies in each city.

Some programmes broadcast on Vividh Bharati are:
* &quot;Hawa-mahal&quot;: Radio drama based on novels and plays
* &quot;Santogen ki mehfil&quot;: Comedy
* &quot;Aaj ke fankar&quot;: Description of life and works of a film artist
* &quot;Chhayageet&quot;: Songs of announcer&#x27;s choice with impeccable scripting

===Central Sales Unit===
The Central Sales Unit (CSU), located in Mumbai, handles the commercial affairs of AIR. 

===Other services===
* Primary Channel
* National Channel

===Regional services===
The headquarters of the Regional Deputy Directors General are located in Delhi and Chandigarh (NR), Lucknow and Bhopal (CR), Guwahati (NER), Kolkata (ER), Mumbai and Ahmedabad (WR), and Chennai and Bangalore (SR) All frequencies are in kHz, unless otherwise specified. Most of the channels are also available online.



==External services==

The external services of All India Radio are broadcast in 27 languages to countries outside India via high-power shortwave radio transmissions. Mediumwave is also used to reach neighboring countries. In addition to language-specific broadcasts targeted at particular countries, there is a General Overseas Service that broadcasts in English, offering 8¼ hours of programming daily aimed at a general international audience.

The external broadcasts began on October 1, 1939, initiated by the British government to counter Nazi propaganda directed at the Afghan people. Initially, the broadcasts were in Pashto, targeting Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier Province. Over time, broadcasts expanded to include languages such as Dari, Persian, Arabic, English, Burmese, Japanese, Chinese, Malay, and French. Currently, the external services broadcast in 16 foreign languages and 11 Indian languages, with a total program output of 70¼ hours per day on medium and shortwave frequencies.

Two high-powered FM stations of All India Radio are being installed in Amritsar and Fazilka, Punjab, to complement the programs broadcast from transmitters in Jalandhar, New Delhi, Chandigarh, and Mumbai. These stations aim to improve broadcast services, particularly during unfavorable weather conditions, in the border regions of Punjab.

Today, the External Services Division of All India Radio broadcasts 57 transmissions daily, offering nearly 72 hours of programming that reaches over 108 countries in 27 languages. Of these, 15 are foreign languages and 12 are Indian. The foreign languages include Arabic, Baluchi, Burmese, Chinese, Dari, French, Indonesian, Persian, Pushtu, Russian, Sinhala, Swahili, Thai, Tibetan, and English (General Overseas Service). The Indian languages are Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Konkani, Kashmiri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Nepali, Punjabi, Saraiki, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu.

The longest daily broadcast is the Urdu Service to Pakistan, which airs around the clock on DTH (direct-broadcast satellite) and on short- and medium-wave for 12¼ hours. The English-language General Overseas Service is broadcast for 8¼ hours daily. During Hajj, special broadcasts in Urdu are beamed to Saudi Arabia. Additionally, AIR is planning to produce programs in the Balochi language.

The external services of All India Radio (AIR) are also broadcast to Europe in DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) on 9950 kHz between 17:45 and 22:30 UTC. These transmissions are delivered via high-power transmitters located in Aligarh, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Gorakhpur, Guwahati, Mumbai, and Panaji on shortwave, and from Jalandhar, Kolkata, Nagpur, Rajkot, and Tuticorin on mediumwave. All India Radio Amritsar plans to launch a booster service on the FM band. Some of these transmitters have a power output of 1000 kW (1 MW) or 500 kW. Programs are broadcast to various parts of the world, excluding the Americas, with very good reception quality in the target areas.

Each language service includes news, commentary, press reviews, talks on general or cultural topics, feature programs, documentaries, and music from India and the target region. Most of these programs originate from New Broadcasting House on Parliament Street in New Delhi, with some originating from SPT Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jalandhar, Kolkata, HPT Malad Mumbai, Thiruvananthapuram, and Tuticorin.

The External Services Division of All India Radio (AIR) serves as a vital link between India and the rest of the world, particularly in countries with significant Indian diaspora. It broadcasts India&#x27;s perspective on national and international matters and showcases the Indian way of life through its programs. QSL cards, which are highly sought after by international radio hobbyists, are issued by AIR in New Delhi in response to reception reports of their broadcasts.

==Direct-To-Home==
Direct-to-home (DTH) service is a satellite broadcast service where a large number of radio channels are digitally transmitted over a territory from a high-power satellite. All India Radio broadcasts various national and regional stations, which can be accessed on DD Free Dish. The DTH signals can be received directly at homes using a small dish receiver unit, which includes a dish antenna installed on the rooftop or a wall facing clear south, with the receiver placed indoors. DTH service is offered on twenty one channels via Insat.

The most prominent broadcaster of English features was Melville de Mellow, while Shiv Sagar Mishra was renowned for his Hindi features. This format has been revived by AIR producers across India due to its flexibility, relatively low production cost, messaging potential, and creative possibilities.

<doc id="577474" wikidata="Q814658" url="?curid=577474" title="Confessional">
<text>A confessional is a box, cabinet, booth, or stall where the priest in some Christian churches sits to hear the confessions of penitents. It is the typical venue for the sacrament in the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Churches, but similar structures are also used in Anglican churches of an Anglo-Catholic orientation. In the Catholic Church, confessions are only to be heard in a confessional or oratory, except for a just reason.

The confessional is usually a wooden structure, with a centre compartment—entered through a door or curtain—where the priest sits, and on each side there is a latticed opening for the penitents to speak through and a step on which they kneel. By this arrangement the priest is hidden, but the penitent is visible to the public. Confessionals sometimes form part of the architectural scheme of the church; many finely decorated specimens, dating from the late 16th and the 17th centuries, are found in churches on the continent of Europe. A notable example, in Renaissance style, is in the at Leuven, but more usually, confessionals are movable pieces of furniture.

In modern practice of the Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican churches, apart from receiving absolution in the confessional, many churches offer private Confession and Absolution at the chancel rails or in a reconciliation room, as well as during communal penitential rites.

In Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy confessionals are not used: the confession often occurs in sight of other believers, e.g., those waiting in the row for the same purpose, but at some distance from them to not break the &quot;seal of confession&quot;. Let it be understood that the &quot;seal of confession&quot; is technically of Roman usage.

==History==
The confessional in its modern form dates no further back than the 16th century. Du Cange cites the year 1563 for an early use of the word for the tribunal. The term was applied to the burial place of a martyr or &quot;confessor&quot;, that being one who confesses Christ. There are also instances where the name was attached to the spot, whether cell or seat, where noted saints had a habit of hearing confessions. For example, the confessional of Church of St. Trophime at Arles.

In the popular Reformed view, confessional boxes are associated with the scandals, real or supposed, of the practice of auricular confession. However, the boxes were devised to guard against such scandals by securing at once essential publicity and a reasonable privacy, and by separating priest and penitent. In the Middle Ages corresponding and stringent rules were established in canon law for confessions by women, and especially by nuns.

In England, before the Protestant Reformation, publicity was reckoned the best safeguard. Thus Archbishop Walter Reynolds, in 1322, says in his &quot;Constitutions&quot;: &quot;Let the priest choose for himself a common place for hearing confessions, where he may be seen generally by all in the church; and do not let him hear any one, and especially any woman, in a private place, except in great necessity.&quot;.

In Italy, men&#x27;s confessions were heard in the sacristy face to face,or the priest would draw aside the central confessional curtain which separated him the rest of the church and hear a man&#x27;s confession. Women&#x27;s confessions were heard in the confessional with a screen between priest and penitent. The maxim,&quot;numquam solus cum sola&quot; was strictly enforced by this method. Hearing a man&#x27;s confession in the box became common in the United States for convenience sake as sacristies were not as vast as they were in Italian churches.

It would seem that the priest usually heard confessions at the chancel opening or at a bench end in the nave near the chancel. There is, however, in some churchwardens&#x27; accounts mention of a special seat: &quot;the shryving stool&quot;, &quot;shriving pew&quot; or &quot;shriving place&quot;. (On a related note, the observance of Shrove Tuesday is named after the practice of shriving/confession.) At Lenham, in Kent, there is an ancient armchair in stone, with a stone bench and steps on one side, that appears to be a confessional.

With the revival of the practice of auricular confession in the Church of England, confessionals were introduced into some parishes with an Anglo-Catholic bent. Since, however, they formed no part of &quot;the furniture of the church&quot; in the &quot;second year of King Edward VI&quot;, some have argued that they are not covered by the &quot;Ornaments Rubric&quot; in the Prayer-Book. The question of their legality was raised in 1900 in the case of &quot;Davey v. Hinde&quot; (vicar of the Church of the Annunciation at Brighton), tried before Dr Tristram in the consistory court of Chichester. They were condemned &quot;on the ground that they are not articles of church furniture requisite for or conducive to conformity with the doctrine or practice of the Church of England in relation to the reception of confession&quot;.

&quot;Confessional&quot;, in the sense of a due payable for the right to hear confession, is now obsolete.

<text>Cuenca, officially Santa Ana de los Ríos de Cuenca, is an Ecuadorian city, head of the canton of the same name and capital of the province of Azuay, as well as its largest and most populated city. It is crossed by the Tomebamba, Tarqui, Yanuncay and Machángara rivers, in the south-central inter-Andean region of Ecuador, in the Paute river basin, at an altitude of 2,538 meters above sea level and with a temperate Andean climate averaging 16.3 °C.

It has been locally called &quot;Cuenca of the Andes&quot; or &quot;Athens of Ecuador&quot; for its architecture, its cultural diversity, its contribution to Ecuadorian arts, sciences and literature, and for being the birthplace of many illustrious figures of Ecuadorian society. At the 2022 census it had a population of 596,101 inhabitants, making it the third most populous city in the country behind Guayaquil and Quito. The city is the core of the Cuenca metropolitan area, which is also made up of nearby rural towns and parishes. The conglomerate also ranks third among Ecuador&#x27;s conurbations.

It was founded on April 12, 1557, on the ruins of the Inca city of Tomebamba (a major administrative center) and the Cañari city of Guapondelig, by Gil Ramírez Dávalos, under orders of the viceroy of Peru Andrés Hurtado de Mendoza. During the 20th century, the city continued to grow, promoting education and culture, and in 1999 its historic center was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is one of Ecuador&#x27;s most important administrative, economic, financial and commercial centers. The city&#x27;s main activities are commerce and industry; in recent years, Cuenca has also established itself as an international tourist attraction.

==Toponymy==
The city is named Santa Ana de los Ríos de Cuenca in honor of the city of Cuenca in Spain, birthplace of the Spanish viceroy of Peru Andrés Hurtado de Mendoza, who was the one who ordered the Spanish Gil Ramírez Dávalos to found the city and the fact that this place, in its geographical features, is very similar to the Spanish city. Viceroy Andrés Hurtado was also at that time High Guard of the European city of Cuenca, and it was then a gift from the conquistador to the viceroy. In addition, the name &quot;de los Ríos&quot; includes the fact that it is crossed by the rivers: Tomebamba, Tarqui, Yanuncay and Machángara. The rest of the name comes from the Spanish tradition of dedicating new cities to a saint of the Catholic Church, in this case Saint Anne.

==History==


“The plateau is a place treasured by empires,&quot; comments Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera. &quot;The Cañari then Inca and then Spanish occupied the region in the last two millennia, each renaming it in their own language. Now the capital city is called Cuenca and the province Azuay.”

According to studies and archeological discoveries, the origins of the first inhabitants go back to the year 8060 BC in the Cave of Chopsi. They were hunters, hunting everything the Páramo offered them, and nomads, following the animals and seasons. Their culture is represented by tools such as arrows and spears, which have been found throughout the Andean valley. The culture was most present about 5585 BC.

Later, the early indigenous people used the stable climate, fertile soil, and abundant water to develop agriculture. They grew potatoes, melloco, chocho, squash, and quinoa. They also domesticated animals such as cuys (guinea pigs) and camelids: llamas and alpacas.

Their technology was also advanced. For example, they began creating ceramics. In fact, ceramics constitute the greatest number of artifacts which archeologists use to study their culture. The period from 5000 BCE to 2000 BCE is not well represented in the archeological record. Beginning around 2000 BCE, the people developed a more highly organized society, demonstrating delegated responsibilities, such as the managing of water and control of plagues. People were specialized as administrative and religious authorities (known as &quot;shamans&quot;). This occurred during the periods of Chaullabamba, Huayco, Pirincay, Monjas, Putushio, Huancarcucho, and Jubones. From then until 500 AD began the periods of Tacalshapa III and the Cañari people, who were absorbed into the Incas in the 15th century.

===Pre-Columbian society===
Cuenca was originally a Cañari settlement called &quot;Guapondeleg&quot;. Archeologists believe Cuenca was founded around 500 AD. &quot;Guapondeleg&quot; translates into &quot;land as big as heaven.&quot; Less than half a century before the conquistadors landed, the Incas, after a bitter struggle, conquered the Cañari and occupied Guapondeleg and the surrounding area. Though the Incas replaced the Cañari architecture with their own, they did not suppress the Cañari or their impressive achievements in astronomy and agriculture. As was customary for the Incas, they absorbed useful achievements into their culture. They renamed the city &quot;Tomebamba&quot;. The city became known as the second Cusco, a regional capital.

After the defeat of the Cañari, likely in the 1470s, the Inca emperor, Tupac Yupanqui, ordered the construction of a grand city to be called Pumapungo, &quot;the door of the Puma.&quot; Its magnificence was said to have rivaled that of the Inca capital of Cuzco. Indians told stories to the Spanish chroniclers of golden temples and other such wonders, but by the time the Spaniards found the legendary city, all that remained were ruins. They wondered what happened to the fabled splendor and riches of the second Inca capital. After having been abandoned by the Cañari and then the Incas, Tomebamba was sparsely populated until the 1550s.

Tomebamba is considered a candidate for the mythical city of gold which the Spanish called &quot;El Dorado&quot;. The Spanish thought El Dorado was burned by the inhabitants after they heard of the Spanish conquests. Tomebamba&#x27;s destruction by its inhabitants prior to the arrival of the Spanish suggests it may have been what the Spanish called &quot;El Dorado&quot;.

===Spanish settlement===

The Spanish settlement of Cuenca was founded on April 12, 1557, by the explorer Gil Ramírez Dávalos. Andrés Hurtado de Mendoza, then Viceroy of Peru had commissioned the founding and ordered the city named after his home town of Cuenca, Spain. It was founded decades after other major Spanish settlements in the region, such as Quito (1534), Guayaquil (1538), and Loja (1548).
Cuenca&#x27;s population and importance grew steadily during the colonial era.

Cuenca reached the peak of its importance in the first years of Ecuador&#x27;s independence; Cuenca achieved its independence on November 3, 1820. It became the capital of one of the three provinces that made up the nascent republic. The other two capitals were Guayaquil and Quito.

==Population==
As per the last INEC estimate for 2015, the population of the Cuenca canton was 580,000 inhabitants, of which 400,000 constitute the urban population (i.e., the population of the city proper). Local publications estimate that the expat population is between 4,000 and 6,000. The economic development is based on industry and agricultural development.

The Cuenca Metropolitan Area includes the cities of Azogues, Biblian, and Deleg in the Cañar province and the cities of Paute and Gualaceo in the Azuay province with a population of 730,000 inhabitants; however, Cuenca&#x27;s influence in the cultural, economic, and educational areas extends to all the remaining cities around the city.

==Economy==
Cuenca is known for its textiles, furniture, hats, and shoes. The straw hats known around the world as Panama hats are made in Cuenca by local artisans. Cuenca also exports flowers to the United States and countries in Europe. While farming has shrunk in the past years, it is still an important sector of the city&#x27;s economy, mainly vegetables and corn. Cattle ranching is also an important economic activity. Since Cuenca is located in the Andes mountains surrounded by forested areas nearby, mining and logging are also local industries. Some of the common mined resources are kaolin, plaster, limestone, sand, and carbon. Cuenca has also an important industrial and commercial sector.

Tourism continues to grow: Cuenca has many churches and a well-preserved old town that are a part of the cultural heritage of the city. Near Cuenca some important national parks, including Cajas National Park have been created.

At the turn of the century, the country&#x27;s economy was affected by the change in currency, from sucre to USD.

==Geography==
&quot;Cuenca&quot;, capital of the province of Azuay, is located in the sierra of the Andes in the &quot;Austro&quot; or southern region of Ecuador. It is approximately 470 km south of Quito and 200 km southeast of Guayaquil. The city ranges from above sea level.

The dominant features of the city&#x27;s geography are also the source of its name in Spanish: the four rivers of &quot;Cuenca&quot; (meaning a basin made by a confluence of rivers). These rivers are the Tomebamba (named after the Inca culture), Yanuncay, Tarqui and Machangara, in order of importance. The first three of these rivers originate in the Páramo of El Cajas National Park to the west of the city.

==Education==

=== Universities ===
The first university in the city, the Universidad de Cuenca, was established in 1867. It is considered the third oldest university of the country, after the Universidad Central del Ecuador (1836) and the Universidad Nacional de Loja (1859). Ever since, the city has been growing and more universities were created with new careers. This led to the declaration of Cuenca as the City of Universities by the National Assembly of Ecuador on January 4, 2011.

The city has the following Universities:
*Universidad de Cuenca (UCUENCA)
*Universidad Politécnica Salesiana (UPS)
*Universidad del Azuay (UDA)

* Colegio Alemán Stiehle (German school)

==Main sights==

Most tourists visit the historic area, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, between the river Tomebamba and the streets of Gran Colombia to the north, General Torres to the west, and Hermano Miguel to the east. This area&#x27;s compactness, grid-like layout, and numerous readily identifiable monuments make it easy to navigate. Outside this area the city can be confusing, as there are dozens of narrow colonial streets with similar buildings.

Major fiestas of Cuenca come at the time of the &quot;Mass of Children&quot; that is carried out the day of the Arrival of Kings (January 6 - Epiphany Day), or in the commemoration of the independence of the city (November 3), during which processions, cultural acts, and dances are organized.
The nearby Cañar plantation (in the county of the same name) features the biggest Inca ruins in Ecuador.

===Landmarks===
*Old Cathedral (Iglesia de El Sagrario). Built in 1557, the edifice eventually became too small for the town&#x27;s attendants. In 1880, a new cathedral was built as the replacement. The old cathedral, no longer consecrated, has been restored and is now used as a museum.
*New Cathedral (official name: Catedral Metropolitana de la Inmaculada Concepción). Its towers are truncated due to a calculation error of the architect. Had it been constructed as planned, the foundation would not bear the weight of the full towers. In spite of the architect&#x27;s immeasurable mistake, the New Cathedral of Cuenca, completed in 1975, is a monumental work of faith. A combination of Romanesque Revival and Neo-Gothic in style, the church&#x27;s blue and white domes have become a symbol for the city. Its façade is made of alabaster and local marble, while the floor of the nave is covered with pink marble, brought from Carrara (Italy). At its inauguration, the newly constructed Cathedral could accommodate 9,000 of Cuenca&#x27;s 10,000 inhabitants at that time.
*Park Abdon Calderon. It is located in the center of Cuenca between the old and new cathedrals. On the park benches, people meet to converse and absorb its tranquility. The municipal offices are located nearby.
*Monastery of El Carmen de Asuncion. In the atrium a colorful flower market supplements the beauty of the church, which was founded in 1682. A sculpted stone façade and a golden pulpit make the church very attractive.
*Monastery and Museum of La Concepcion, with 17th-century tombs and a complete collection of religious art.
*House of the Ecuadorian Culture
*Municipal Museum Remigio Crespo Toral
*Museum of the Central Bank
*Museum of the Aboriginal Cultures
*Church of Santo Domingo
*San Blas
*Turi the Mirador
*Ruinas de todos los santos. In this ancient place, four niches of Inca origin exist. Their form is trapezoidal, and they are built of stone. It includes the remains of a colonial mill.


===Surroundings===
*Molleturo, a vast rural area (about ) situated in Ecuador&#x27;s southern Andes, is composed of several little villages (hamlets). The centre of the area is located 1.5 hours away by car from the nearest big city (Cuenca). This distance, however, is very short compared to ten years ago, when there was no road for cars and it took people three days of mule riding to get to Cuenca. In spite of the advantages, the road has also had negative impacts on the ecological system, which is still very important for people&#x27;s daily survival.
*Jima, located near Cuenca, is a hiking hotspot for southern Ecuador. Jima is located at the base of two beautiful green mountains at . Hikes for all skill levels are available, including a three-day hike from the peaks of the Andes mountains down into the lush tropical rainforest of the Amazon basin.
*Gualaceo
*Chordeleg, located less than from Cuenca, is a town of Cañari origin known for its weavers, embroiderers, and potters. This same area includes a stone corridor in snake form, built in pre-Inca time, known for gold and silver smiths and local jewelry.

*El Cajas, a national park with rivers, streams, and lagoons, is located in a region in which the altitude varies from above sea level. It is a place for bird watchers and trout fishermen.

*Azogues, the capital of Cañar Province, is located from Cuenca. A city with a colonial atmosphere, one of its highlights is San Francisco&#x27;s convent, built on the summit of a huaca (sacred mountain) of the prehispanic residents.
*Cañar plantation, with a colorful market and the nearby ruins of Ingapirca (&quot;Kichwa:&quot; &quot;Inca wall&quot;), is located from Cuenca and is usually the starting point for the trips to the famous ruins that, according to experts, were used to control the native Cañaris. Stores, bathrooms, a tambo for the Inca, and a temple dedicated to the sun are all part of Ingapirca, which was built in the 15th century by orders of Huayna Capac.

==Culture==
===Festivities===
One of the festivities celebrated in Cuenca and in other parts of Ecuador is &quot;El Carnaval.&quot; This holiday is celebrated three days prior to Ash Wednesday. Families get together to celebrate what started as a &quot;pagan ritual.&quot; Now it is celebrated by wetting friends and random people with water balloons and spraying &quot;Carioca,&quot; a nonstaining foam.

Additionally, Cuenca&#x27;s Independence Day is celebrated at the beginning of November. The festivities span a number of days and consist of various parades, concerts, cultural events, and artisan fairs.

===Gastronomy===
The gastronomy of Cuenca shares characteristics with other mountainous parts of Ecuador. As in other regions of Ecuador, cuy (guinea pig) and hornado are popular traditional dishes. Additionally, dishes made from potatoes and corn (different kinds of mote) such as Llapingachos, mote pillo, mote pata, and morocho are popular. Trout, which can be caught in nearby El Cajas National Park, is another popular dish.

In Cuenca, lunch is the largest meal of the day and is typically served in two courses. The first course is soup, which is followed by a plate of stewed or grilled meat and rice.

==Transport==

===Bus station===
Cuenca&#x27;s interprovincial bus station, called the Terminal Terrestre as it is in most cities, is well organized and clean. It is located on Avenida España in the northeastern corner of the city, a twenty-minute walk or a brief taxi ride from the historic center. Also, many city buses provide frequent service as indicated by the &quot;Terminal Terrestre&quot; placard on the windshield.

Buses arrive and depart throughout the day. Service is available to major cities, such as Guayaquil and Quito and also to nearby cities such as Loja, Riobamba, or Machala. The distance to Guayaquil is 243 km. and the bus takes nearly 4 hours on the highway Durán-Pto.Inca-Molleturo (I582W), a scenic ride through the Cajas National Park. Quito is 497 km from Cuenca, and the trip takes around 10 hours on the Pan-American Highway (I35N). Many prefer to travel by bus at night. Those who choose to travel overnight should exercise caution due to reported bus hijacks, which have resulted in armed robbery.

===Airport===
The airport, Aeropuerto Mariscal Lamar (Mariscal Lamar International Airport), is due east of the Terminal Terrestre (bus station) on Avenida España. It is a five-minute walk from the bus station. Two airlines currently serve Cuenca: Avianca Ecuador and LATAM Ecuador both fly to Quito. It is Ecuador&#x27;s third-busiest airport, with over 1,400,000 passengers passing through its gates every year.

===Tram===
A tram/light rail line was completed in early 2019, and the tramway opened May 25, 2020.
The line runs a total of 10.5 km.(7 miles) with 27 stations, starting at Cuenca Industrial Park in the north, crossing the Historic Center of Cuenca, and ending south at the entrance to Baños.

===Cuenca public transportation statistics===
According to the Moovit Public Transport Index, Cuenca&#x27;s bus system compares extremely favorably with other cities in Latin America. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Cuenca, for example to and from work, is 51 minutes on a weekday, with only 7% of public transit riders riding for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a bus stop or bus station for public transit is 11 minutes, while a mere 9% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day.

<text>Cuenca () is a city and municipality of Spain located in the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha. It is the capital of the province of Cuenca.

== Etymology ==
Its name may derive from the Latin &quot;conca&quot; meaning &quot;river basin&quot;, referring to the gorge of the rivers Júcar and Huécar. It may also be derived from the now-ruined Arab castle, Kunka. Other alternative original names have been suggested, including &quot;Anitorgis&quot;, &quot;Sucro&quot; or &quot;Concava&quot;. The city of Cuenca is also known as the &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; because of its precarious position on the edge of a gorge.

== History ==
When the Iberian peninsula was part of the Roman Empire, there were several important settlements in the province, such as Segobriga, Ercavica and Gran Valeria. However, the place where Cuenca is located today was uninhabited at that time.

When the Muslims captured the area in 714, they soon realized the value of this strategic location and they built a fortress (called &quot;Kunka&quot;) between two gorges dug between the Júcar and Huécar rivers, surrounded by a 1 km-long wall. Cuenca&#x27;s economy soon became dominated by agriculture and textile manufacturing, enjoying growing prosperity.

In the early 11th century, the Caliphate of Córdoba broke into several rump states (&quot;taifas&quot;). Cuenca was ruled by the taifa of Toledo—possibly the largest one—whose jurisdiction roughly spanned across the bulk of the Middle March of Al-Andalus. In 1076, Cuenca was besieged by Sancho Ramírez of Aragon, who failed to conquer the place. In 1080 King Yahya al-Qadir of Toledo lost his taifa, and his vizier signed in Cuenca a treaty with Alfonso VI of León and Castile by which he ceded him some fortresses in exchange for military help.

Following the Christian defeat at the battle of Sagrajas (1086), Cuenca was captured by the taifa king of Seville, Al-Mu&#x27;tamid ibn Abbad. However, when his lands were attacked by the Almoravids, he sent his daughter-in-law Zaida to Alfonso, offering him Cuenca in exchange for military support. The first Christian troops entered the city in 1093. 

However, the Almoravids captured it in 1108. Their governor in Cuenca declared independence in 1144, followed by the whole of Murcia the following year. In 1147 Muhammad ibn Mardanis became King of Cuenca, Murcia and Valencia. He defended his lands from the Almohad invasion until his death in 1172, after which his son had to sign a pact of tributes with the newcomers. A 17-year-old Alfonso VIII of Castile tried to conquer the place, but after five months of siege, he had to retreat after the arrival of troops sent by the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf. Alfonso signed a seven-year truce but when, in 1176 the Cuenca locals occupied some Christian lands in Huete and Uclés, Alfonso intervened at the head of a coalition including also Ferdinand II of León, Alfonso II of Aragon and the Military Orders of Calatrava, Santiago and Montegaudio, besieging Cuenca for months starting from 1177&#x27;s Epiphany. The Cuenca&#x27;s commander, Abu Bakr, again sought the support of Yaqub Yusuf, but the latter was in Africa and did not send any help. After an unsuccessful sortie against the Christian besiegers&#x27; camp on 27 July, Cuenca was conquered by Alfonso&#x27;s troops on 21 September 1177, while the Muslim garrison took refuge in the citadel. The latter fell in October, putting an end to Arab domination. 

Cuenca was given a set of laws, the Fuero, written in Latin, that ruled Cuenca&#x27;s citizens, and it was considered one of the most perfectly written at that time. The Diocese of Cuenca was established in 1183; its second bishop was St. Julian of Cuenca, who became patron saint of the city.

Alfonso X granted Cuenca the title of &#x27;city&#x27; (&quot;ciudad&quot;) in 1257.
During the next few centuries Cuenca enjoyed prosperity, thanks to textile manufacturing and livestock exploitation. The cathedral started to be built at that time, in an Anglo-Norman style, with many French workers, since Alfonso VIII&#x27;s wife, Eleanor, had French cultural affinity.
Historically, there was a Sephardic Jewish community in Cuenca first recorded in 1177 until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Inquisition continued to prosecute the descendants of the conversos of Cuenca. The last trial took place from 1718-1725, where hundreds of crypto-Jews were cruelly persecuted under Philip V of Spain. 

During the 18th century the textile industry declined, especially when Carlos IV forbade this activity in Cuenca in order to prevent competition with the Real Fábrica de Tapices (Royal Tapestry Factory), and Cuenca&#x27;s economy declined, thus losing population dramatically (5,000 inhabitants). During the independence war against Napoleon&#x27;s troops the city suffered great destruction, and it made the crisis worse. The city lost population, with only around 6,000 inhabitants, and only the arrival of railroads in the 19th century, together with the timber industry, were able to boost Cuenca moderately, and population increased as a result to reach 10,000 inhabitants. In 1874, during the Third Carlist War, Cuenca was taken over by Carlist troops, and the city suffered great damage once more.

The 20th century began with the collapse of the Giraldo cathedral&#x27;s tower in 1902, which affected also the façade. The first decades of the 20th century were as turbulent as in other regions of Spain. There was poverty in rural areas, and the Catholic Church was attacked, with monks, nuns, priests and a bishop of Cuenca, Cruz Laplana y Laguna, being murdered. During the Spanish Civil War Cuenca was part of the republican zone (&quot;Zona roja&quot; or: &quot;the red zone&quot;). It was taken in 1938 by General Franco&#x27;s troops. During the post-war period the area suffered a major economic decline, causing many people to migrate to more prosperous regions, mainly the Basque Country and Catalonia, but also to other countries such as Germany. The city started to recover slowly from 1960 to 1970, and the town limits went far beyond the gorge to the flat surroundings.

In recent decades the city has experienced a moderate growth in population and economy, the latter especially due to the growing tourism sector, and both of them fuelled by improvements in road and train communications. Cuenca has strongly bet on culture and as a result of this it was declared a World Heritage Site in 1996. In recent years, new cultural infrastructure such as the municipal Concert Hall and the Science Museum saw Cuenca unsuccessfully apply for the title of European Capital of Culture in 2016.

== Geography and climate ==
Cuenca is located across a steep spur, whose slopes descend into deep gorges of the Júcar and Huécar rivers. It is divided into two separate settlements: the &quot;new&quot; city is situated south-west of the old one, which is divided by the Huécar course.

The climate of Cuenca is the typical hot-summer Mediterranean climate of Spain&#x27;s &quot;Meseta&quot; (inner plateau). Winters are relatively cold, but summers are quite hot during the day with occasional cool nights. Spring and autumn seasons are short, with pleasant temperatures during the day but with rather cold nights due to its altitude from above sea level up to in the old town.

== Main sights ==


=== Cathedral of Our Lady of Grace and Saint Julian ===

Cuenca Cathedral was built from 1182 to 1270. The façade was rebuilt after it crumbled down in 1902. It is the first gothic style Cathedral in Spain (together with Avila&#x27;s), because of the influence of Queen Eleanor, the wife of Alfonso VIII and daughter of King Henry II of England and Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, who introduced the Anglo-Norman style.

From that date the cathedral has undergone some changes. An apse-aisle (doble girola) was added in the 15th century, while the Renaissance Esteban Jamete&#x27;s Arch was erected in the 16th century. The main altar was redesigned during the 18th century by famous architect Ventura Rodríguez: it features a precious iron-work gate. The façade was rebuilt in 1902 from ruins due to the collapse of the bell tower, the Giraldo, by Vicente Lámperez, with two new twin towers at both ends of the façade, which have remained unfinished without the upper part of them. In the early 1990s modern coloured windows were installed, and in 2006 one of the two old baroque organs from Julián de la Orden was recovered. The other organ has also been restored, and on 4 April 2009 an inauguration ceremony was held.

The naves do not follow exactly a straight line. The &quot;San Julián&quot; altar, dedicated to Saint Julian of Cuenca, at the apse-aisle, consists of columns made of green marble.

Another curiosity are the &quot;Unum ex septem&quot; signs at some chapels. It is said that if one prays looking at these signs one would obtain a five-year forgiveness for one&#x27;s sins, and seven years if one prays during the patron saint&#x27;s day.

=== Church of Saint Peter ===
With Romanesque origins, the church of St. Peter (&quot;San Pedro&quot; in Spanish) was rebuilt by Jose Martin de la Aldehuela during the 18th century and displays since that time a Baroque façade. It shows an octagonal shape outdoors but it is circular inside, and it is located at Plaza del Trabuco.

This church can be reached by going up along San Pedro Street from Plaza Mayor.

=== Church of Saint Michael ===
The Church of Saint Michael (&quot;Iglesia de San Miguel&quot; in Spanish) was erected during the 13th century, with only one nave and an apse. In the 15th century, a second nave at the north side was added. The dome was built by Esteban Jamete in the 16th century, and finally the wooden ceiling of the two naves was replaced with stone vaults during the 18th century.

Saint Michael was restored in the 20th century, and its management was transferred to Cuenca&#x27;s municipality from Cuenca&#x27;s diocese, so that this church could be used to hold classical music concerts. In fact, Saint Michael is home of the Religious Music Week (&quot;Semana de Musica Religiosa&quot;) together with other places within the city and its province.

It is located at San Miguel street, next to Plaza Mayor. Saint Michael is accessed through a descending narrow passage which starts at Plaza Mayor left lateral (looking from the Town Hall).

=== Church of Our Savior (&quot;Iglesia del Salvador&quot;) ===
Built in Neo-Gothic style during the 18th century, with only one nave and a high tower. It shows a modest baroque façade and some remarkable baroque altars indoors. The door is however quite modern, added in the late 1990s.

The famous religious procession &quot;Las Turbas&quot;, held on Good Friday morning, starts at this location, since the image of &quot;Jesús el Nazareno&quot;, which is at the forefront of the procession, is kept within &quot;El Salvador&quot;.


=== Bridge of Saint Paul ===
The bridge of Saint Paul (&quot;Puente de San Pablo&quot;) was built from 1533 to 1589, a construction driven by the canon Juan del Pozo, over the gorge of the River Huecar, aiming at connecting the old town with St Paul convent.

The original bridge collapsed, and the current one was built in 1902, made of wood and iron according to the style dominating at the beginning of the 20th century. It is up to 40 metres high and supported by the remains of the old bridge.

=== Seminary ===
The Seminary (Seminario), a rectangular building stretching from Plaza de la Merced to Mangana Square, was established under the rule of José Flores y Osorio, the Bishop of Cuenca (1738–1759), and built by Vicente Sevill, around 1745. The Baroque façade at Plaza de la Merced was erected in 1748.

It holds a library with numerous ancient books, some of them incunabula (previous to 1501). There is also a Rococo meeting room inside and a Gothic altarpiece at the chapel, but visits are not allowed.

In 2004 some books from this library were stolen, but the suspect of the robbery was caught and the books recovered before entering on an auction process.

Now an average of 10–15 future priests are trained there, according to statistics of the Spanish Episcopal Conference.[1]
=== Old convent of Saint Paul ===

The convent of Saint Paul was built in the 16th century by command of the canon priest Juan del Pozo, a monk belonging to the Dominican Order. Brothers Juan and Pedro de Alviz were in charge of the building project; Pedro worked on the convent and the cloister and Juan on the church.

The church was finished in the 18th century, in rococo style.

The convent was ruled by Dominican friars, but during the 19th century was handed over to the Pauline Fathers, who were based here until 1975, when they left due to the possible collapse of the building. In the 1990s the convent was restored to house the Parador Nacional de Turismo in Cuenca, a hotel which allows the visit to the convent as well as the access to the church.

The cloister has an ornamental source of water, and the cafeteria is the old chapel. From the convent the old town can be reached easily by crossing St Paul bridge.

=== Bishop&#x27;s Palace ===
The bishop&#x27;s palace features, on three of its museums, the Diocese&#x27;s Museum, which has a remarkable collection of religious art. It can be easily accessed from the cathedral.

The rooms where the collection is shown were remodeled by architect Fernando Barja Noguerol, and Gustavo Torner selected the art pieces from an inventory made by some priests of the Diocese in 1977. Some of the diocese&#x27;s artistic patrimony was lost during the Peninsular War, the confiscation of ecclesiastical property by Juan Álvarez Mendizábal, and the Spanish Civil War.

Masterpieces like The Byzantine Diptych (book-like silver work whose origin is dated around 1370, containing saints&#x27; relics), paintings by El Greco, and handcrafted carpets from Cuenca&#x27;s school, can be seen at the museum.

=== The Castle ===
&quot;El Castillo&quot; is the name for the remains of an ancient Arab fortress, representing the older structures of Cuenca. Only a tower, two stone blocks, the arch which allows to enter/leave the old town from the Barrio del Castillo and a fragment of the walls have been left. The arch (&quot;arco de Bezudo&quot;) is named after Gutierre Rodriguez Bezudo, from Segovia, who fought the Arabs with King Alfonso VIII to conquer Cuenca.

In the Muslim era, the historian Ibn Al-Abbar mentions that once upon a time, the imam of the mosque of the citadel of Cuenca was Ja’far bin Isa Al-Umawi (from Umayyad lineage), a distinguished scholar, poet and expert in the Arabic language who passed away in the year 460 A.H/1068 A.D. 

The castle was home of the Holy Inquisition after 1583, and it was finally destroyed during the 19th century by French soldiers during the Spanish War of Independence.

Nearby are the small chapel and cemetery of San Isidro.

=== Mangana Tower ===
The origins of the Mangana Tower remain unclear. In 1565 it was painted by Anton van den Wyngaerde, which indicates that at that time Mangana had already been built up, and after the attacks by French soldiers during the Spanish War of Independence war – at the beginning of the 19th century – and having been hit previously by a thunderbolt in the 18th century, it became badly destroyed. Mangana Tower was rebuilt by Fernando Alcántara in Neomudejar style – inspired on Arab decorative motifs – in 1926. Finally, Victor Caballero gave Mangana its current look in a fortress-like style in 1968.

It has a clock on one of its walls and a recording of bell chimes can be heard in the old town at certain times (every quarter of an hour).

There are views from the near viewpoints over the river Jucar&#x27;s gorge and the modern neighborhoods. Mangana can be reached on foot from Plaza Mayor.

=== Town Hall ===
The Town Hall is a building in baroque style built up during the ruling period of King Carlos III and supported over three Roman arches. It was finished in 1762, as it can be read on the façade. Nevertheless, in the 18th century Mateo Lopez was the architect in charge of the extension of the building since it was necessary to amply the building for the oratory as well as the archive.

The central arch is the only one giving access to vehicles to Plaza Mayor.

=== Hanging Houses ===

Built over a rock above the Huecar River gorge in the 15th century, &quot;Las Casas Colgadas&quot; are the only remaining samples of this type of building which was common in this city a long time ago.

Hanging Houses can be considered the most famous civil buildings in Cuenca. They house a restaurant and the Museum of Abstract Arts and they serve as the background of millions of photos made from the bridge of San Pablo.

=== Monument devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus ===
On top of the Cerro del Socorro you can find the monument devoted to the Holy Heart of Jesus, whose materials were transported on donkeys in the mid-20th century. This place is a magnificent viewpoint over the city. It can be accessed by taking the road to Palomera / Buenache de la Sierra (Huecar river gorge) and turn right after , approx.

=== Cuenca Province Council ===
The provincial council&#x27;s seat (&quot;Diputación provincial de Cuenca&quot;) is a building with 2 floors built at the early 20th century according to a project conceived by provincial architect Rafael Alfaro. Cuenca&#x27;s coat of arms at the façade is made of Carrara marble.

=== Others ===
Other notable buildings in Cuenca include the &quot;San Felipe Neri&quot; church, the &quot;Our Lady of Light&quot; church (&quot;Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Luz&quot;) and the &quot;Las Petras&quot; convent.

=== Parks ===
*&quot;El Escardillo&quot;, with a few trees and a fountain over a small patch of ground. It is one of the few green areas in the old town.
*&quot;Los Moralejos&quot;: located near the entry point from Madrid, Los Moralejos, also known as &quot;Carrero&quot; (its old name was Carrero Blanco, the VP of General Franco), is a park which was enlarged in the early nighties, when San Julian&#x27;s fair was moved to its current location, thus releasing some amount of land. A bicycle lane has been built recently, as well as a new connection with the &quot;el Sargal&quot; sport centre.
*&quot;Santa Ana&quot;, &quot;El Vivero&quot;, near to Cuenca&#x27;s bullring, large trees give shadow to most of the park.
*&quot;San Fernando&quot;: located in the expansion area of Cuenca, it is settled on a slope and features, among other attractions, three small lakes.
*&quot;San Julián&quot;, the oldest one in Cuenca, created at the beginning of the 20th century, from land donated by Gregoria Fernández de la Cuba, whose sculpture can be found here. San Julián&#x27;s park is an example of sustainable design: there is no grass, instead the rectangles of terrain along the perimeter contain large trees, and are separated by bush rows and sand paths. In the centre, an open space houses a bandstand. A sculpture of Lucas Aguirre y Juárez, which devoted its filantropic efforts to education of poor children, is also here. A fully functional &quot;Manneken pis&quot; relieves thirsty passers-by during the summer days.

== Festivities ==
*Jueves lardero
*St. Julian&#x27;s Day (Julian of Cuenca) – 28 January
*Saint Matthew&#x27;s Day – 21 September: a heifer (&quot;vaquilla&quot;) is released on the streets being led by people with ropes, while people from Cuenca, grouped in &quot;peñas&quot;, eat and drink on the streets during the four-day period. On the first day, peñas get to Plaza Mayor on foot while being watered by the old town&#x27;s inhabitants from their balconies.
*Holy Week: Fiesta of International Tourist Interest of Spain

== Transportation ==

On 2010 December 19 a new AVE (high-speed rail) link was established between Madrid – Atocha and Valencia and some of the high-speed trains stop at the Cuenca–Fernando Zóbel railway station, some 5 km from the city centre and connected by urban bus route 1, thus providing travellers with frequent connections every day with both Madrid and Valencia, this reduced the journey time to only 50 minutes to/from Madrid and one hour to/from Valencia. Renfe operated a non-high-speed service taking 3 hours going from Madrid, serving the historical station in the city centre, but the conventional line was closed on 2022 July 20 and the station is only served by private high-speed rail operator Iryo. Auto Res, a bus operator, links Madrid to Cuenca with a 2-hour or 2½-hour trip duration. The A-40 motorway, recently completed, connects the city with the A-3 at Tarancón, away from Madrid, thus totalling to Spain&#x27;s capital, and far from Valencia, via the A-3 in the opposite sense.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Cuenca is twinned with:

* Cuenca, Ecuador
* L&#x27;Aquila, Italy
* Ronda, Spain
* Plasencia, Spain
* Taxco de Alarcón, Mexico
* Paju, South Korea (2007)
* Cerreto Sannita, Italy (2017)
* Bollène, France (2012)
== Gastronomy ==
The following are typical dishes from the Cuenca area, being basically the result of combining those of Serranía and Mancha areas:
*&quot;Ajo arriero&quot;, made of cod, potato and garlic, can be spread on bread
*&quot;Cordero&quot;, some pieces of lamb simply roasted or in caldereta
*&quot;Morteruelo&quot;, a kind of pâté made of different kinds of meat, mainly hare, partridge, hen and pork.
*&quot;Pisto manchego&quot;, a mixture of vegetables (tomato, pepper, courgette/zucchini) cut up and fried together, similar to the &quot;ratatouille&quot; from France.
*&quot;Queso manchego&quot;, coming from Villarejo de Fuentes, Santa María del Campo Rus or Villamayor de Santiago, made only from sheep&#x27;s milk
*&quot;Setas&quot;, during the autumn a great variety of mushrooms can be collected in the forests near Cuenca. The most frequent is the so-called &quot;Níscalo&quot;, but other species, such as boletus, can also be found.
*&quot;Trucha&quot;, trout from the mountain rivers just grilled
*&quot;Oreja&quot;, &quot;Forro&quot;, &quot;Panceta&quot;: different cuts of pork usually grilled
*&quot;Mojete&quot;: traditional salad made of tomato.
For dessert, the &quot;Alajú&quot; is an Arab cake made of honey, almonds, nuts and grated orange rind.
&quot;Resoli&quot; is a typical drink, served in a glass with ice cubes or directly drunk from a &quot;porrón&quot; after a meal.

<text>In universal algebra, an abstract algebra &quot;A&quot; is called &quot;simple&quot; if and only if it has no nontrivial congruence relations, or equivalently, if every homomorphism with domain &quot;A&quot; is either injective or constant.

As congruences on rings are characterized by their ideals, this notion is a straightforward generalization of the notion from ring theory: a ring is simple in the sense that it has no nontrivial ideals if and only if it is simple in the sense of universal algebra. The same remark applies with respect to groups and normal subgroups; hence the universal notion is also a generalization of a simple group (it is a matter of convention whether a one-element algebra should be or should not be considered simple, hence only in this special case the notions might not match).

A theorem by Roberto Magari in 1969 asserts that every variety contains a simple algebra.

<text>Silves () is a city and municipality in the Portuguese region of Algarve, in southern Portugal. The population of the entire municipality of Silves in 2011 was 37,126, in an area of 680.06 km2. The urbanized area of the city proper has approximately 11,000 inhabitants. Silves is the former capital of the Kingdom of the Algarve (1249–1910), a nominal kingdom within the Kingdom of Portugal (1139–1910), and is of great historical importance.

==History==

The region of Silves has been inhabited since the Palaeolithic, as attested by archaeological remains, including several menhirs. The river Arade, which was navigable in historical times, linked the hinterland to the open ocean and allowed the transport of produce and commerce. The town of Silves (&quot;Cilpes&quot;) was possibly founded during the times of Roman domination, when the region was part of the Lusitania province. It was probably a Lusitanian Castro in pre-Roman times; however the region was also settled by other Indo-European tribes, such as the Celtici and Cynetes (or Conii). Silves was once also part of the Visigothic Kingdom (418–c. 721).

After 713, when the Moors invaded Iberia, Silves became part of the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba under the Arabic name of &quot;Shilb&quot; (شلب). In the 10th century it was one of the most important towns in western Al-Andalus. Silves became an independent taifa in 1027 under the rule of Ibn Mozaine and his son, who was dethroned in 1051 by al-Mu&#x27;tadid, the governor of Seville. al-Mu&#x27;tamid ibn &#x27;Abbad, the son of al-Mu&#x27;tadid and a famous poet, ruled the taifa of Silves until 1091. After the Almoravid conquest the town became Almohad in 1156.

In 1189, King Sancho I of Portugal conquered the town with the aid of Northern European crusaders. Sancho ordered the fortification of the city and built a castle, which is today an important monument of Portuguese heritage. At the time he also styled himself &quot;By the Grace of God, King of Portugal and Silves (&quot;Dei Gratiæ, Rex Portugalliæ et Silbis&quot;). 
However, he soon lost the town again to the Almohads after sieges in 1190 and 1191. Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from Al-Andalus to ravage the Iberian Christian kingdoms, bringing back booty and slaves. The governor of Córdoba attacked Silves in 1191, and took 3,000 Christian slaves. In 1197, the city was attacked by German crusaders, but did not permanently change hands.

The town was finally taken from the last Muslim king Ibn Afan by Paio Peres Correia, Grand-Master of the Order of Santiago in 1242, after the Alentejo and most of the coast had already fallen in 1238. The great mosque was changed into Silves Cathedral (&quot;Sé Catedral&quot;). Silves declined in importance thereafter and was eclipsed in the region by Faro during the colonial period. In 1491, the town of Silves was given to queen Eleanora by her husband, king John II of Portugal.
In the 19th century, Silves became an important centre for the Portuguese cork industry. The industry&#x27;s decline began after cork factory workers, instigated by communist and anarcho-syndicalist organizations resorting to coercion at gunpoint, supported the failed Portuguese general strike of 1934, after which the authoritarian &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime retaliated by effectively closing down the industry in the town.

In the 21st century, the municipality became host to the Iberian Lynx National Breeding Center (Silves&#x27; Center).

==Sights==

Parts of the Almohad town wall, constructed from poured concrete, have been preserved, as well as the Almedina-gate (Porta de Loulé). Other sights include the Santa Misericórdia Church with a fine door in Manueline style (the main body of the church was built in 1727–28); a museum for cork and the production of bottle corks in a defunct factory which is now also a centre for cultural events called &quot;Fábrica do Inglês (The Englishman&#x27;s Factory); and the municipal museum (Museu Municipal de Arqueologia) with findings from the palaeolithic onwards.

The town is situated on a hill above the Arade River. Silves Castle is located on the top of the hill. It occupies ca. 12,000 m2. Archaeological excavations have shown that the oldest buildings date back to the 8th century, the stratigraphy is almost 6 m deep and contains Iron Age remains as well. Silves Castle is widely regarded as the finest example of Arab military architecture in Portugal. The walls are made of red sandstone (grés de Silves) with a pisé-core and were heavily restored in the 1940s. Protruding towers of the albarra-type protect the Northern slope. After the Christian conquest, the castle served as the seat of the alcaide-mor (provincial governor) until the middle of the 16th century; afterwards the towers were used as a prison.

Silves Cathedral was built in 1189 where an old mosque used to stand. It combines Baroque and Gothic styles. Inside there are tombs of local bishops and dignitaries, as well as tombs of some of the Crusaders who fought here against the Moors all those years ago.

Igreja da Misericórdia de Silves is church across from the cathedral with specific door from the 16th century in the Manueline style. It is placed halfway up the building. Inside the church is huge altarpiece from the 17th century.

The Roman Bridge, or Ponte Romana Bridge holds a significant place in history. It is believed to have been built back when the Romans were in charge. This sturdy stone bridge stretches right over the Rio Arade, standing as a strong reminder of Roman architecture.

Opened in 1990, the Silves Municipal Archaeological Museum is located just below Silves Cathedral and Silves Castle. The museum is built over an 18-meter-deep, 4-meter-wide well that dates from the Almohad establishment of the city in the 11th century. The site was formerly occupied by a 19th-century residence before the building was demolished to form the museum.

Cruz de Portugal is a significant religious monument encapsulating Silves’ Christian history. It is crafted from white limestone and adorned with intricate carvings, its exact origins are unknown, with estimates placing it from the late 14th to the late 15th century. It is widely believed to have been gifted to Silves by D. Manuel I in 1499. The cross, standing at 3 meters and showcasing Christ crucified and a Pietà, is an example of Gothic style. Over the years, the cross has moved around the city, settling in its current 19th-century location in 1957, surrounded by a garden.

==Geography==
The municipality is crossed by the Arade River, which was navigable in historical times and was key to the prosperity of the city of Silves. The waters of the river form the reservoirs of Arade and Funcho. The landscape of the municipality is generally hilly. To the south the municipality borders the Atlantic Ocean.

Silves is built on top of one of the largest aquifers in the south of Portugal, The Querença-Silves Aquifer , and has many orange groves, a fruit introduced by the Moors.

Silves is about 15 kilometers north of the nearest stretch of Algarve coast, 20 kilometers northeast of Portimão and 62 kilometers northwest of Faro International Airport by road.

===Climate===
Silves has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, very dry summers and mild, wet winters. The climate in the municipality of Silves is slightly more continentalized than the Algarvian coast, leading temperatures to be higher during the day and lower during the night in every season of the year. Temperatures in the winter vary between during the day and at night. Temperatures in the summer vary between during the day and at night.

===Human geography===

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Alcantarilha e Pêra
* Algoz e Tunes
* Armação de Pêra
* São Bartolomeu de Messines
* São Marcos da Serra
* Silves

==Economy==
The activities linked to the secondary sector play a very important role in the municipality&#x27;s economy. The cork and extractive industries are the main activities. The extractive industry emerged in the Metal Age and is linked to the beginning of an old tradition in metallurgy in the area, and the cork industry, implemented in the second half of the nineteenth century, triggered the economic and urban development of Silves. The agricultural area occupies about 10.3% of the municipality, being typical the cultivation of cereals for grain, nuts, citrus fruits including famed orange orchards, meadows, permanent pastures, fallow and olive groves. The municipality of Silves, where important part of the Algarve&#x27;s citrus fruit production is concentrated, has created an Orange Route (&quot;Rota da Laranja&quot;), with different routes through the area. The Orange Route provides the visitor with several suggestions and agents that allow them to build a route that covers all stages of orange production, from the orchard to its packaging. This route has partnerships with some local producers who are available to welcome the public and provide several experiences in their orchards. There visitors can find gastronomic, cultural, landscape, accommodation, thematic itineraries, among other experiences. As for livestock, poultry, sheep and pigs stand out as the main species raised. Silves has a low forest density, little over 15% (15.1%) of the usable agricultural area, corresponding to 11,187 hectares. The city of Silves proper attracts many visitors due to its ancient castle and other urban attractions. The annual Medieval Fair in the historical neighborhoods of Silves near the castle is one of the biggest and most visited summer festivals in the Algarve. Near the coast, in Armação de Pêra and its beaches, tourism is very important during summertime in terms of number of visitors and revenue.

==Education==
The city has kindergartens and elementary schools. Besides the local state-run secondary school, &quot;Deutsche Schule Algarve&quot;, a German international school, is also in the municipality of Silves, as well as a branch of the Instituto Piaget, a higher education institution.

<text>In Hindustani classical music, the jor (Hindi: जोर, ; also spelt jod and jhor) is a formal section of composition in the long elaboration (&quot;alap&quot;) of a raga that forms the beginning of a performance. It comes after &quot;alap&quot; and precedes &quot;jhala&quot;, the climax. Jor is the instrumental equivalent of nomtom in the dhrupad vocal style of Indian music. Both have a simple pulse but no well-defined rhythmic cycle.

== Origin and terminology ==
Jor (or jod) is an instrumental interpretation of nomtom which is an introductory style that is characterised by its modest rhythm and lack of rhythmic cycle (also known as tal). Jor is present in most Hindustani classical music through the raga, as an articulate and rapid pulse that the alap transitions into, followed by jhala.

== In Hindustani music ==

Indian classical music is divided into 2 sections: Hindustani and Carnatic Music. Both musical styles inhabit the core traditions of India culture, and are portrayed as one of the most prestigious types of music.  These two traditional types of music are both defined by the Sanskrit term &quot;sangita&quot; which refers to the fusion of all the elements, of song, instrumental music and dance. Hindustani Music is primarily found in the Northern areas of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The oral nature of North Indian Music allows for expressive communication between the performers and audience. Raga and Dhrupad are the two main forms of Hindustani classical music and form the prominent structure of Indian Classical Music. The musical section of Jor is prominent in Raga and follows the cyclical and linear progression of Hindustani music.

=== Raga ===

The concept of Raga (Rag) can be divided into 5 different components as proposed by Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy:
# Scale
# Ascending and descending line
# Transilience
# Emphasised notes and register
# Intonation and obligatory embellishments

Raga is derived from Sanskrit, a classical language from South Asia, and is defined as &quot;the act of colouring and dyeing.&quot; Amongst Indian Classical Music, raga is identified as the basic melodic framework and acts as a communication medium for two musicians. In the Raga there is a constant interplay between what is learnt from the performance, what is known and what is continued through improvisation. A raga utilises a particular scale and combines it with prototypical melodic patterns, creating combinations of tonic intervals which evoke unique emotions.

A typical raga composition is shown as sequences of events, starting with the alap and followed by the gat. A performance of raga depends on the balance between the melody and the way the audience and performer engage with the material. The Jor is situated between the Alap and Jhala, commonly known as the instrumental Alap-Jor-Jhala-Gat format. This framework details the unmetered instrumental structure of the Raga, which is performed with a regular pulse and over a wider melodic range. This format is the foundation of Dhrupad as was introduced into the West in the 20th century.

In a full performance, the Raga can be split into three sections, the alap, jor and jhala. Jor and Alap acts as equivalents to one another, and the Jhala is a fast and unaccompanied part where the Jor is accelerated to reach a peak/climax. Within the Jor and Jhala, a pulse can be heard throughout. These sections, especially Jor is described as not a beat nor a rhythm but a movement that helps the Raga gain momentum in the beginning of the piece. The frameworks and methods employed may vary according to whether the raga is performed by a vocalist or an instrumentalist.

=== Dhrupad ===

Dhrupad is another form of Raga that is older and restricts the Alap, Jor and Jhala sections in such a way that is heard more frequently in present day. This genre of Indian Music formed the foundation for the Alap-Jor-Jhala-Gat structure to be welcomed to the West in the 20th Century. In Dhrupad, its distinctive feature is the climatic beginning in comparison to Raga&#x27;s ascending composition. The word Dhrupad meaning ‘fixed verse’ refers to the complex opening section (Alap) allowing the other sections to grow and expand.  

It is common in Dhrupad, for the Alap to be extended and unaccompanied, similar to most instrumental genres in Northern Indian music. It also focuses on a longer and more structured version of the alap-jor section. In comparison to Khayal, there is a clear structural division between the opening of Raga-alap and Jor. The Jor section in Dhrupad can be heard by its increasingly articulated and rapid pulse. Within this section, Jor follows the most common rhythmic cycle in Dhrupad, being the twelve beat.  The theme of intensification is prominent as the subsequent switch from the alap to jor, is identified as more rhythmic once it reaches the Jor section. A common instrument utilised throughout Dhrupad, in the jor, is the Rudra Vina, a string instrument that evokes a melodic rhythm.

A study conducted by Napier, portrays that the end point of the Dhrupad is the articulation of the last note played in the Alap during the Jor section. It also notes that there is a large sectionalisation in the Dhrupad that is obvious in Jor as the consistency in regard to rhythmic composition is hard to recognise in Dhrupad.

== Structure ==

=== Rhythm ===
An instrumental performance of jor comprises sitarist who will pluck certain notes on a guitar or another instrument, with a consistent rhythm. A vocal performance of Jor will show a vocalist singing each phrase in equal time. A recording of two Raga performances conducted by Dhaeambir Singh Dadhyalla, indicated that Jor, along with Alap, lasts for 5 minutes which reduced the amount of tempo change throughout the beginning section.

An experiment conducted by Will, Clayton, Wertheim, Leante, Berg shows that the pulse progression in the Jor and Alap sections of Raga are distinctively different. The alap shows that there are at least nine different pulse rates, whilst in Jor there are only three. These characteristics in the Jor that distinguish it from the other sections are what creates different responses from audiences.

In the 3-section format of the Raga, Alap-Jor-Jhala, Jor and Alap can share similarities in its composition and rhythmic style. However, Jor contains distinctive features which makes it stand out in the Raga. Jor in comparison to the Alap, is usually slow in its introduction into the Raga, but continuously builds until it reaches a fast tempo. This allows a steady transition into the Jhala, as it continues the quickened beat set by Jor. Alap is solely defined by its free rhythm, whereas Jor is limited to its regular pulse following a simple beat pattern which can be elaborated in some cases. As the Raga progresses, Jor acts as the link between the Alap and Jhala as it applies the melody introduced in the Alap and expands it through to the Jhala. The utilisation of Gamak throughout Jor, which consists of a pattern of three notes exploring a wider range or octave. Another difference between the two opening sections is the freedom granted to Jor as it moves between different pulses and speeds, whilst still focusing on certain smaller parts within the song.

=== Transition ===
The transition between the three section, alap-jor-jhala, is continuous and each part builds from its predecessor.  Jor (literal meaning, &quot;join&quot;) acts the second introduction after the alap, within a raga performance. It follows a similar structure to alap, with a shift in rhythmic style. As the Raga transitions into the Jor, the pulse is introduced by the melody instrumentalist. The Jor utilises the features of scale and patterns in the previous section (Alap) and improvises to create a new variation of these features. During jor, the performance must maintain a steady pulse with the exclusion of drums, which remains the same throughout Alap, Jor and Jhala.

In musical notation, jor follows the same notes as alap, with a constant steady beat between each. Narayan states that Jor is the &quot;faster portion of alap, with rythmn,&quot; but deviates from Alap through its ability to concentrate on smaller sections or notes throughout the Raga. The distinction between alap and jor is made between the increase in regularity in the jor in comparison to previous alap section. Similarly, the basic sound sequence in this section is formed by chikari events to evoke a prominent timbral-rhythmic pattern.  The relationship between the two, forms the definition of a bridge that is connected with the light characteristics of alap and followed by the controlled design of the raga, where the drums decide the join into the arrangement. The theme formed in the introduction of the Alap, is continued to Jor, where the drums and rhythmic beats are excluded, and the chosen melodic instrument is strummed at an accelerated pace or the performer increases the phrasing of each syllable.

<doc id="577511" wikidata="Q8069128" url="?curid=577511" title="Zenith Carburettor Company (British)">
<text>The Zenith Carburetter Company Limited was a British company making carburettors in Stanmore Middlesex, founded in 1912 as a subsidiary of the French . In 1965, the company joined with its major pre-war rival Solex Carburettors, and over time, the Zenith brand name fell into disuse. The rights to the Zenith designs were owned by Solex UK (a daughter company of Solex in France).

While better known for its much later products, Zenith produced carburettors that were standard equipment on some very early, brass era automobiles, including the Scripps-Booth.

==Products==
Zenith&#x27;s best-known products were the Zenith-Stromberg carburettors used from 1965–1967 Humber Super Snipe Series Va/Vb, Humber Imperial, 1967–1975 Jaguar E-types, Saab 99s, 90s and early 900s, 1969–1972 Volvo 140s and 164s, 1966–1979 Hillman Minx, Hunter (Arrow), 1966–1970 Singer Gazelle/Vogue (Arrow), 1967–1975 Sunbeam Alpine/Rapier Fastback (Arrow), 1970–1981 Hillman/Chrysler/Talbot/Sunbeam Avenger/Plymouth Cricket, MGs and some 1960s and 1970s Triumphs.

The Triumph Spitfire used Zenith IV carburettors in the North American market. In Australia, the CD-150 and CDS-175 models were fitted to the high-performance, triple-carburettored Holden Torana GTR-XU1.

Designed and developed by Dennis Barbet (Standard Triumph) and Harry Cartwright (Zenith) to break SU&#x27;s patents, the Stromberg carburettor features a variable venturi controlled by a piston. This piston has a long, tapered, conical metering rod (usually referred to as a &quot;needle&quot;) that fits inside an orifice (&quot;jet&quot;) that admits fuel into the airstream at the venturi of the carburettor. Since the needle is tapered, as it rises and falls, it opens and closes the opening in the jet, regulating the passage of fuel, so the movement of the piston controls the amount of fuel delivered, depending on engine demand.

The flow of air through the venturi creates reduced static pressure within it. This pressure drop is communicated to the upper side of the piston via an air passage. The underside of the piston is in communication with atmospheric pressure. The difference in pressure between the two sides of the piston creates a force tending to lift the piston. Counteracting this force is the weight of the piston and the force of a compression spring that is compressed by the piston rising; because the spring is operating over a very small part of its possible range of extension, the spring force approximates to a constant force. Under steady state conditions, the upward and downward forces on the piston are equal and opposite, and the piston does not move.

If the airflow into the engine is increased – by opening the throttle plate, or by allowing the engine revolutions to rise with the throttle plate at a constant setting – the pressure drop in the venturi increases, the pressure above the piston falls, and the piston is sucked upward, increasing the size of the venturi, until the pressure drop in the venturi returns to its nominal level. Similarly, if the airflow into the engine is reduced, the piston will fall. The result is that the pressure drop in the venturi remains the same regardless of the speed of the airflow – hence the name &quot;constant depression&quot; for carburettors operating on this principle – but the piston rises and falls according to the speed of the airflow.

Since the position of the piston controls the position of the needle in the jet, and thus the open area of the jet, while the depression in the venturi sucking fuel out of the jet remains constant, the rate of fuel delivery is always a definite function of the rate of air delivery. The precise nature of the function is determined by the tapered profile of the needle. With appropriate selection of the needle, the fuel delivery can be matched much more closely to the demands of the engine than is possible with the more common fixed-venturi carburettor, an inherently inaccurate device whose design must incorporate many complex fudges to obtain usable accuracy of fuelling. The well-controlled conditions under which the jet is operating also make it possible to obtain good and consistent atomisation of the fuel under all operating conditions.

This self-adjusting nature makes the selection of the maximum venturi diameter (colloquially, but inaccurately, referred to as &quot;choke size&quot;) much less critical than with a fixed-venturi carburettor.

To prevent erratic and sudden movements of the piston, it is damped by light oil in a dashpot (under the white plastic cover in the picture), which requires periodic topping-up.

A major drawback of the constant-depression carburettor is its unsuitability in high-performance applications. Since it relies on restricting air flow to produce enrichment during acceleration, the throttle response lacks punch. By contrast, the fixed choke design adds extra fuel under these conditions using its accelerator pump.

<doc id="577515" wikidata="Q877820" url="?curid=577515" title="Momotarō">
<text>is a popular hero of Japanese folklore. His name is often translated as &quot;Peach Boy&quot;, but is directly translated as &quot;Peach + Tarō&quot;, a common Japanese given name. &quot;Momotarō&quot; is also the title of various books, films and other works that portray the tale of this hero.

There is a popular notion that Momotarō is a local hero of Okayama Prefecture, but this claim was invented in the modern era. This notion is not accepted as consensus in scholarly circles.

==Story==

The present conventional form of the tale (Standard Type) can be summarized as follows:
Momotarō was born from a giant peach, which was found floating down a river by an old, childless woman who was washing clothes there. The woman and her husband discovered the child when they tried to open the peach to eat it. The child explained that he had been bestowed by the gods to be their son. The couple named him Momotarō, from &quot;momo&quot; (peach) and &quot;tarō&quot; (eldest son in the family). When he was just five years old, he was able to cut a big tree with just an old knife.

When he matured into adolescence, Momotarō left his parents to fight a band of &quot;Oni&quot; (demons or ogres) who marauded over their land, by seeking them out in the distant island where they dwelled (a place called Onigashima or &quot;Demon Island&quot;). En route, Momotarō met and befriended a talking dog, monkey and pheasant, who agreed to help him in his quest in exchange for a portion of his rations (&quot;kibi dango&quot; or &quot;millet dumplings&quot;). At the island, Momotarō and his animal friends penetrated the demons&#x27; fort and beat the band of demons into surrendering. Momotarō and his new friends returned home with the demons&#x27; plundered treasure and the demon chief as a captive.
This Standard Type of &quot;Momotarō&quot; was defined and popularized due to them being printed in school textbooks during the Meiji Period.

This is the result of development of the literary &quot;Momotarō&quot;, which had been handwritten and printed since the early Edo period into Meiji. One significant change is that in most examples of Edo Period literature, Momotarō was not born from a peach, but born naturally to the elderly couple who ate the peach and regained their youth. Such subtypes are classed as , whereas the now conventional subtypes are termed .

==Development in literature==
Although the oral version of the story may have emerged during the Muromachi period (1392–1573), it may not have been set down in writing until the Edo period (1603–1867). The oldest works of Momotaro known to have existed had been dated to the Genroku era (1688–1704) or perhaps earlier.

===Edo period===
These older texts from around the Genroku era (e.g. &quot;Momotarō mukashigatari&quot;) are lost, but surviving examples of later dates, such as the reprint &quot;Saihan Momotarō mukashigatari&quot; (c. 1777) purportedly preserve the older tradition, and form the first (most primitive) group of texts according to . The late date of the reprint has sometimes caused it to be classed as &quot;kibyōshi&quot; (&quot;yellow cover&quot; book, directed primarily at an adult audience) or later type of &quot;kusazōshi&quot; literature (intended for a more general audience, including women and children), but it should properly be classed as &quot;akahon&quot; (&quot;red book&quot;) or early type.

A second group of texts, which Koike considered to be younger, includes the miniature &quot;akahon&quot;, , printed in Kyōhō 8 (1723). This miniature book is now considered to be the oldest surviving copy of any written Momotarō story.

Whether belonging to the first or second groups, texts from the Edo Period generally follow the same general plot as the modern standard versions but exhibit certain differences in detail.

====Dumpling, kindling, animals====
Momotarō is not supplied with &quot;kibi dango&quot; (&quot;millet dumplings&quot;), but rather with and other treats in the oldest Genroku era texts and the first group. In the first group, the old man goes out to cut grass, rather than to cut . The same three companion beasts (pheasant, monkey, then dog) appear in both groups, but in a different order. Though the order of the animals is not significant to the story, the most common order that appear is the dog, the monkey, and then the pheasant. In nearly every variation, all three animal companions agree to help Momotarō in exchange for a portion of his food. In one variation from the Edo Period, the dog is given half a portion, the monkey willingly comes, and Momotarō threatens the pheasant.

====Birth from peach====
As noted above, in most of the Edo Period books, peach boy is not born from a peach but from the woman who consumes a peach and grows years younger in age. Both the first and second groups consist entirely of &quot;rejuvenation&quot; types. The &quot;birth from the peach&quot; type examples (such as the version in Takizawa Bakin&#x27;s 1811 essay &quot;Swallowstone Miscellany&quot;) are found among tales that have deviated further, which Koike assigns to a third group of texts. While &quot;birth from the peach&quot; version has not been confirmed in earlier written texts from the Edo Period, one tantalizing sculpture dating to 1614 depicted a man standing in the middle of a split peach. This purported Momotarō carving at Kehi Shrine in Tsuruga, Fukui was lost during the air raids of 1945.

====Momotarō&#x27;s age====

It was noted that the protagonist Momotarō was being drawn progressively younger by artists over the years. In one subjective estimation, Momotarō appeared about age 30-ish until c. 1735, 25-ish up to c. 1800, and 20-ish until the end of Edo Period in 1867.

Not every text specifies age, but in the version in (1798–1861)&#x27;s Momotarō&#x27;s was 15 years and 6 months when he set out on his expedition. And in &quot;Momotarō takara no kurairi&quot; (c. 1830–40), Momotarō was aged sixteen. The Momotarō in Iwaya Sazanami&#x27;s version of 1894 was of similar age (15 years old) when he resolved to go to devil island.

Researcher also noticed the trend of Momotarō being depicted younger and younger, and he dubbed the phenomenon .

===Meiji period===
After Japan abandoned the feudal system and entered the Meiji era, became a seminal figure in how the Momotaro story was shaped and became familiarized to the Japanese populace. Sazanami was the author of the Momotaro tales in his commercially successful folktale collections, and also a major contributor to the textbook versions.

The &quot;Momotarō&quot; tale was first incorporated into nationalized textbooks for elementary schools by the Meiji government in 1887. It was subsequently omitted from the 1st edition of the National Language Reader or but reappeared from the 2nd edition onward to the 5th edition. It has been generally accepted that the 2nd edition reader of 1910 was &quot;de facto&quot; written by storybook author Iwaya Sazanami, who had joined the Ministry of Education as nonpermanent staff in 1906.

Iwaya had already published a version of &quot;Momotaro&quot; (1894) for his &quot;Nihon mukashibanashi&quot; (Japanese Folktales), where Momotaro is cast as a military soldier or commander (shōgun) of Great Japan (Dainihon), dispatched on a punitive campaign to quell the ogres who live in the northeast. Older texts took the punishing of &quot;oni&quot; for granted and dispensed with explaining what crimes the oni committed to deserve condemnation. But in Iwaya&#x27;s version, the ogres were explicitly stated as being evil beings, who devoured the &quot;poor people&quot; and taken &quot;plunder&quot; from the Emperor&#x27;s land of Japan (Ozaki&#x27;s translation), thus morally justifying Momotaro&#x27;s expedition. It has been suggested these ogres represented the Qing dynasty of China since the publication occurred in 1895, which saw the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War.

===Taishō and Shōwa eras===
From the 3rd edition National Language Reader (1918–1932) onwards (until the end of World War II), &quot;Momotaro&quot; has occupied the spot of the last tale in Book 1 of these nationalized elementary textbook series. Teachers in essays submitted in 1917 stated that the perception of the Momotaro tale was shifting, so that they were seen as containing lessons of assertiveness and helping in the material advancement of one&#x27;s country. There was criticism from the liberalism side, for example, the novelist Yamamoto Yūzō (1925) protesting that the &quot;oni&quot; were being punished for no apparent reason, and is &quot;tantamount to telling [children] to think of foreigners as &quot;oni&quot;&quot;.

In the early Shōwa era, after Emperor Hirohito assumed the throne, Momotarō continued to be used to instill patriotism (or the teachings of the Rescript on Education) pupils with the 4th edition National Language Reader (1933–1938) which begins with the picture of the cherry blossom. The &quot;Momotarō&quot; of the 4th edition was modified so that the &quot;oni&quot; now stated &quot;We will no longer torment the people nor take things. Please spare our lives&quot;, and forfeits their treasures out of their own volition, thus addressing the foregoing issues (i.e., Momotarō accused of attacking &quot;oni&quot; for no legitimate reason).

The use of Momotarō in wartime propaganda against the U.S. and its Allies was discussed extensively by John W. Dower in his book &quot;War Without Mercy&quot; (1986). Dower is credited with coining the term &quot;Momotarō paradigm&quot; in this respect. Momotarō disappeared from Japanese textbooks at the end of World War II.

==Oral variants==
The story has some regional variations in oral telling.

In some variants, a red and white box are seen floating down the river, and when the red box is chosen to be recovered, Momotarō is found inside. These may be a red box and a black box, or the box may contain a peach inside. These types are often seen in the northern parts of Japan (Tōhoku and Hokuriku regions).

Or Momotarō may exhibit the characteristic of the lazy protagonist in the &quot;Sleeping Boy&quot; stories. These subtypes have been collected mainly in the Shikoku and Chūgoku regions.

There are variances about the Momotarō&#x27;s process of growth; one is that he grew up to meet the expectation of the old couple to be a fine boy. Another is that he grew up to be a strong but lazy person who just sleeps all day and does not do anything. It is possible that the Momotarō being a fine boy version is more famous to give lessons to children. Nowadays, Momotarō is one of the most famous characters in Japan, as an ideal model for young kids for his kind-heartedness, bravery, power, and care for his parents.

Grown up, Momotarō goes on his journey to defeat the demons when he hears about the demons of the Onigashima (demon island). In some versions of the story, Momotarō volunteered to go help the people by repelling the demons, but in some stories he was forced by the townspeople or others to go on a journey. However, all the stories describe Momotarō defeating the Oni and living &#x27;happily ever after&#x27; with the old couple.

==Claims as local hero==
Momotarō now enjoys popular association with Okayama City or its prefecture, but this association was only created in the modern era. The publication of a book by Nanba Kinnosuke entitled &quot;Momotarō no Shijitsu&quot; (1930) for example helped the notion of Momotarō&#x27;s origins in Okayama to gain wider familiarity. Still, even as late as the antebellum period before World War II (1941–1945), Okayama was considered only the third contender behind two other regions known as Momotarō&#x27;s homeland.

The demon island () of the story is sometimes associated with Megijima Island, an island in the Seto Inland Sea near Takamatsu, due to the vast manmade caves found there.

Inuyama, Aichi has with a legend associated with it. In the 1920s and 1930s, lyricist Ujō Noguchi wrote three &quot;folk songs&quot; for the locality alluding to the Momotaro legend.

==English translations==
The story has been translated into English many times. &quot;The Adventures of Little Peachling&quot; appeared in A.B. Mitford&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Old Japan&quot; in 1871. William Elliot Griffis published a version in 1880, which remained obscure even to researchers, even though English translations in subsequent decades apparently borrowed from Griffis&#x27;s phraseology and use of idiom, sometimes even copying outright.

Rev. David Thompson&#x27;s translation as &quot;Little Peachling&quot; appeared as the first volume of Hasegawa Takejirō&#x27;s &quot;Japanese Fairy Tale&quot; series in 1885. A second edition appeared in 1886, with a different set of illustrations, drawn by Kobayashi Eitaku

Susan Ballard included the tale in &quot;Fairy Tales from Far Japan&quot; (1899).

Yei Theodora Ozaki included a loosely translated version in her &quot;Japanese Fairy Tales&quot; (1903); Ozaki&#x27;s retellings were based on a version by &quot;Sadanami sanjin&quot; (&quot;sic.&quot;, i.e., ). Ozaki was credited with spreading Japanese folktales to the English-speaking nations by researchers such as .

There was another English translation that used the same source as Ozaki and published around the same time, namely, &quot;The Story of Peach-Boy&quot; in &quot;Iwaya&#x27;s Fairy Tales of Old Japan&quot; (1903, repub. 1914) translated by Hannah Riddell. The translation of the collection was a collaborative effort with other translators, such as Fanny B. Greene, Tsuda Umeko and others. This latter effort was acknowledged by Iwaya himself.

Teresa Peirce Williston in her &quot;Japanese Fairy Tales&quot;, Second Series, in 1911.

The tale was translated as &quot;Peach-Prince and the Demons&quot; and included in the compilation &quot;Fairy stories my children love best of all&quot;, although the compiler did not indicate its Japanese origin.

==&quot;Momotarō&#x27;s Song&quot;==
The popular children&#x27;s song about Momotarō titled &quot;Momotarō-san no Uta&quot; (&quot;Momotarō&#x27;s Song&quot;) was first published in 1911; the text&#x27;s author is unattributed, while the melody was written by Teiichi Okano. The first two stanzas, with romanization and translation, are given below.

== As war propaganda icon ==

Portrayal of Momotarō as a soldier in the Japanese Imperial Army fighting hostile nations was already happening by the (First) Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895). The Momotaro tale was altered by Iwaya Sazanami in 1894 so that the &quot;oni&quot; lived to the northeast of Japan, a thinly veiled reference to Qing China given the then current geopolitics. Iwaya was not purely a major figure in children&#x27;s literature, but a government official working as the head of the editorial bureau of the Ministry of Education, since 1878. Iwaya would later pen a whole book of essay on the use of Momotaro as an instructional tool, &quot;Momotarō-shugi no kyōiku&quot; (&quot;the Education Theory Based on Principles in Momotaro&quot;, 1915).

Comic images picturing Momotarō defending Japan against &quot;Oni&quot; representing Russian &quot;Northern Devils&quot; were given out during the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War.

Momotarō was an immensely popular figure in Japan during World War II, appearing in many wartime films and cartoons. Momotarō represented the Japanese government, and the enemy states, namely the Allies, later including the United States was symbolized by the oni, the demonic figure. One wartime film, in which Momotarō and his animals mount on a military operation for the Japanese Armed Forces (against the British) is &quot;Momotarō&#x27;s Divine Sea Warriors&quot;.

<doc id="577536" wikidata="Q7924602" url="?curid=577536" title="Vibhag">
<text>&#x27;Vibhag&#x27; (in music) represents a duration of rhythmic phrasing in Indian classical music made up of a certain number of beats. They are the rough equivalent of bars in western music, but instead of always being equal subdivisions of the tala (the rhythmic cycle - think 12 bar blues), they can be uneven. In certain traditions of [
[music of India|Indian music]], any number of [beat (music)|beats] may form a &#x27;Vibhag&#x27;. Usually the beats will be in two, three, or four. They should be designated either with a clap or a wave of the hand. The meaning of the word Bhag from is parts. The actual measure of the Vibhag is borders or boundaries or boundary lines, in short not in continuity or not continuous. The talas in Tabla or in any other percussion instrument in classical music have Vibhagas to get a track of the beats on Matras on which the singer or player is singing or playing on. For example taking different talas,

Tala Teental has 16 matras in it. It has 4 Vibhags. So Teental with Vibhags is written as

This can also be shown using the following figure

If you see both the tables then you may realize that after every 4 syllables i.e. considering the 1st line so Dha Dhin Dhin Dha after this is a line like this | . This is the symbol of Vibhag. And after the 4 syllables Dha Dhin Dhin Dha is the Vibhag. Now it is simple Maths that if there are 16 matras and if there is a Vibhag after every 4 matras, 2 conclusions are taken out. Those conclusions are that there will be 4 more vibhags after every 4 matra like it was there in the 1st line of Teental which was seen above. The 2nd one will be that after every vibhag there will be 4 matras. So in each Vibhag there will be 4 matras and in total it becomes 4×4 i.e. 16 which are the matras of Teental.
 
The line which you see in the table is the Vibhag and in each Vibhag there are 4 matras and so when multiply 4 and 4, we get 16 which is the matras of Teental.

==Other Talas and Vibhags==
In the following table is the information of the Vibhags, the matras of the tala and the division of how the matras are divided in each Vibhags.

Likewise, Teental has 4 Vibhags,

<text>In Indian classical music, a Matra is a beat, the smallest rhythmic sub-unit of a tala - the musical meter. It is one of the three levels of structure for tala along with Vibhag (measure) and Avartan (cycle). The significance of beats depends on their occurrence in a cycle. However, the value of the beats may be stretched or contracted depending on various factors.

<doc id="577541" wikidata="Q3067117" url="?curid=577541" title="Fastbacks">
<text>Fastbacks are a Seattle, Washington, punk rock band. Formed in 1979 by songwriter/guitarist Kurt Bloch (born August 28, 1960), and friends Lulu Gargiulo (guitar and vocals, born October 12, 1960) and Kim Warnick (bass and vocals, born April 7, 1959), they disbanded in 2001 but have reunited multiple times. Their sound mixes a generally punk rock approach to vocals and sound textures with poppy tunes and strong musicianship.

Although these three band members have remained fairly constant, they have gone through numerous drummers, including Duff McKagan, later of Guns N&#x27; Roses. MTV&#x27;s web page on the Fastbacks says that estimates at the number of Fastbacks drummers &quot;range from 12 to 20.&quot; For much of the band&#x27;s heyday, Mike Musburger filled this role, but other Fastbacks drummers before him (or when he took occasional breaks) included Bloch himself, Richard Stuverud (perhaps best known from War Babies, Fifth Angel and his collaborations with Pearl Jam&#x27;s Jeff Ament, including Three Fish, Tres Mts. and RNDM), Nate Johnson and Rusty Willoughby (both of whom also played in both Flop and Pure Joy), John Moen (of the Dharma Bums, later of Steven Malkmus&#x27;s Jicks and The Decemberists), Jason Finn (of the Presidents of the United States of America), Dan Peters of Mudhoney, and Tad Hutchison of the Young Fresh Fellows. Several of these people also served at times as drummers in The Squirrels, a similarly long-lived band, and the Fastbacks&#x27; sometime label-mates on PopLlama Records, who bring a similar mix of strong musicianship and punk attitude to even poppier material.

Contributing to the band&#x27;s 2001 breakup was Kim Warnick&#x27;s move to the band Visqueen in 2001 through 2004. In summer 2010 Kim Warnick started a new band with Mikey Davis (Alien Crime Syndicate, Tommy Stinson) called Cali Giraffes.

The Fastbacks reunited for a one-off live performance 8 July 2011 at the West Seattle Summer Music Festival, featuring the core trio of Bloch, Warnick, and Garguilo, along with Mike Musburger on drums, their first official show together since their 2001 breakup.

They later reunited in September 2018 for a benefit concert, in aid of fellow Seattle musician Andrew McKeag.

Following a series of archival releases, the Fastbacks released the new single &quot;A Quiet Night&quot; in February, 2023.

<text>Teentaal (alternatively spelled tintal, teental, or tintaal, and also called trital; Hindi: ) is the most common &quot;taal&quot; of Hindustani music, and is used for &quot;drut&quot; (fast tempo). It is symmetrical and presents a very simple rhythmic structure against which a performance can be laid.
&quot;It is of 16 beats&quot; with 4/4/4/4/ pattern and 4divisions.There are 3 claps(tali) and 1 gap(khali).

==Arrangement==
Teentaal has sixteen (16) beats in four equal divisions (Vibhag). The period between every two beats is equal. The first beat out of 16 beats is called &quot;sam&quot; and the 9th beat is called &quot;khali&quot; (&#x27;empty&#x27;). To count the Teentaal, the audience claps on the first beat, claps on the 5th beat, then waves on the 9th beat and lastly again claps on the 13th beat; these three claps (Hindi &quot;teen&quot; &#x27;three&#x27; + &quot;taal&quot; &#x27;clap&#x27;) give the rhythm its name.

==Uses==
Teentaal can be used for both accompaniment and solo. There are various Kaidas and Parans based on it. Teentaal is the most widely used taal. Teentaal is mostly used in the drut laya and Zhalas. 

Theka: 

DHA DHIN DHIN DHA |

DHA DHIN DHIN DHA |

NA TIN TIN TA |

TETE DHIN DHIN DHA |

==Theka==
मात्रा भाग : ४-४-४-४. 
धा धिं धिं धा - धा धिं धिं धा - धा तिं तिं ता - ता धिं धिं धा 
It has a characteristic pattern of bols (theka).
This can also be shown using the following figure
Note the bols used for the first beat of each division: Dha, a bol involving both hands, is played at the beginning of the first, second and final divisions; for the khali section, Naa – a right hand bol – is used to indicate that the division is open. There are some pedagogical variations as to the actual syllables pronounced when reciting the bol, most of which occur in the final two vibhags.
Also note that this variation is from the Lucknow Gherana.

<text>Trzebnica ( ; , ) is a town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship in west-central Poland. It is the seat of Trzebnica County, and of the smaller administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Trzebnica. It lies within the eastern Trzebnickie Hills in the historic Lower Silesia region, approximately north of the regional capital Wrocław. It is part of the Wrocław metropolitan area. As of 2019, it has a population of 13,331.

Trzebnica&#x27;s Sanctuary of St. Jadwiga is one of the historical burial sites of Polish monarchs and consorts.

In 2017, the town was the co-host of the World Games (orienteering, middle distance).

==History==
===Middle Ages===
In the 12th century, the area was among the possessions of the Premonstratensian St. Vincent monastery at Wrocław. Trzebnica itself was first mentioned in an 1138 deed, then held by the Polish voivode Piotr Włostowic and later seized by the Silesian duke Władysław II the Exile. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland it was part of the Silesian province of Poland.
In 1202 Władysław&#x27;s grandson Duke Henry I the Bearded and his wife Hedwig of Andechs founded a Cistercian convent, present-day Sanctuary of St. Jadwiga in Trzebnica, the first in Poland. The couple signed the deed of donation on 23 June 1203 in the presence of Hedwig&#x27;s brother Ekbert Bishop of Bamberg; the monastery was settled with German nuns descending from Bamberg in Franconia. In 1218 Hedwig&#x27;s daughter Gertrude became abbess of Trzebnica, the first of many Piast princesses to hold this office. After Duke Henry died in 1238 and was buried in the church, his widow moved to the Cistercian convent which by now was led by her daughter. Hedwig died in October 1243 and was buried there also, while some of her relics are preserved at Andechs Abbey in Bavaria, she was canonized in 1267.

In 1250 Trzebnica received town privileges, it passed under the jurisdiction of the Lower Silesian Duchy of Oleśnica in 1323, a Bohemian fief from 1328. In 1480 Duke Konrad X the White granted the town to the Cistercian abbey. Town and monastery were devastated several times, by fires as well as by the plague, but also by Hussite troops in 1430.

===Modern era===
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was plundered by Swedish forces and the nuns had to flee across the border to nearby Poland. After the war the premises were rebuilt in its present Baroque style. In the 17th century Trzebnica belonged to the Polish-speaking area in Silesia.

In 1742 Trzebnica (as &quot;Trebnitz&quot;) with most of Silesia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and the monastery was finally securalized in 1810. Meanwhile, the town had become a centre of cloth manufacturing. In 1870 the Order of Saint John acquired the former abbey&#x27;s estates to establish a hospital, cared for by the Sisters of Mercy of St. Borromeo up to today. Between 1871 and 1945 the town was part of Germany. It was heavily damaged during the Vistula–Oder Offensive of the Red Army in the last days of World War II.
After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the town once again became part of Poland. The local population was expelled and replaced by ethnic Poles. From April to June 1945, Trzebnica (instead of Wrocław) was the first post-war regional capital of the Lower Silesian (Wrocław) Voivodeship.

<doc id="577554" wikidata="Q1754772" url="?curid=577554" title="Alice (Tom Waits album)">
<text>Alice is the fourteenth studio album by Tom Waits, released in 2002 on Epitaph Records (under the Anti sub-label). It consists of songs written by Waits and Kathleen Brennan for the opera &quot;Alice&quot; ten years earlier. The opera was a collaboration with Robert Wilson, with whom Waits had previously worked on &quot;The Black Rider&quot;. Waits and Wilson collaborated again on &quot;Woyzeck&quot;; the songs from it were recorded and released on &quot;Blood Money&quot; at the same time as &quot;Alice&quot;.
==Background==
The album contains most of the songs written for &quot;Alice&quot;, directed by Wilson at the Thalia Theatre in Hamburg in 1992. &quot;Alice&quot; is about Lewis Carroll&#x27;s obsession with Alice Liddell, the inspiration for &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871). The play has since been performed in various theatres around the world. The songs had been released as a bootleg in several different versions called &quot;The Alice Demos&quot; many years before its official release. The source is believed to be studio recordings taken when Waits&#x27; car was broken into in late 1992.

In 2002, &quot;Alice&quot; was co-released with &quot;Blood Money&quot;, an album containing songs Waits wrote for Wilson&#x27;s musical &quot;Woyzeck&quot; (2000). Asked why he released &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Blood Money&quot; together, Waits explained: &quot;we believe in the tunes...if you&#x27;re gonna heat up the stove, there&#x27;s no point in making just one pancake, right?&quot; Waits described the songs on &quot;Alice&quot; as &quot;adult songs for children, or children&#x27;s songs for adults. It&#x27;s a maelstrom or fever-dream, a tone poem, with torch songs and waltzes...an odyssey in dream logic and nonsense.&quot;

The songs draw on Waits&#x27; interest in circus performers; &quot;Poor Edward&quot; is about Edward Mordake and &quot;Table Top Joe&quot; is about Johnny Eck. The lyrics reference the &quot;Alice&quot; books; &quot;We&#x27;re All Mad Here&quot; is a line spoken to Alice by the Cheshire Cat. Like many of Waits&#x27;s albums since &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot; has eclectic orchestration. Here he makes use of the Stroh violin, a violin with a horn attached to the bridge. Of the Stroh, Waits says: &quot;they&#x27;re no longer as popular as they were, but they were essential and there were probably fist fights in the orchestra pit before the Stroh. Cause now a lot of people consider &#x27;em obsolete but hey, when I see the word obsolete I get in line.&quot;&quot;

The song &quot;Altar Boy&quot; appears in Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; but not on &quot;Alice&quot;; it was later released on Waits&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2006).

==Reception==
Maddy Costa writes: &quot;what &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Blood Money&quot; also highlight is the consistency of Waits&#x27;s songwriting, and the extent to which Kathleen Brennan, his wife and co-writer of every song here, shares his vision. Through all the experiments that began with 1983&#x27;s &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, Waits has maintained a distinct musical voice, an idiosyncratic way of yoking sounds together. &quot;Alice&quot;&#x27;s mournful ballads all seem to be haunted by ghosts of albums past...he and Brennan share with Lewis Carroll a linguistic playfulness, a delight in choppy syntax and warped juxtapositions. The first lines of Alice&#x27;s title track set the tone: &#x27;It&#x27;s dreamy weather we&#x27;re on/ You wave your crooked wand/ Along an icy pond/ With a frozen moon/ A murder of silhouette crows.&#x27; From there on the lyrics get curiouser and curiouser.&quot;

&quot;Alice&quot; was ranked #2 in Metacritic&#x27;s Top 30 albums of 2002. In 2006 it was awarded a diamond certification from the Independent Music Companies Association, which indicated sales of at least 250,000 copies throughout Europe. As of 2003, &quot;Alice&quot; has sold 140,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen Soundscan.

<text>A school of mines (or mining school) is an engineering school, often established in the 18th and 19th centuries, that originally focused on mining engineering and applied science. Most have been integrated within larger constructs such as mineral engineering, some no longer focusing primarily on mining subjects, while retaining the name.

<doc id="577561" wikidata="Q2335227" url="?curid=577561" title="List of Oz characters (created by Baum)">
<text>This is a list of characters in the original Oz books by American author L. Frank Baum. The majority of characters listed here unless noted otherwise have appeared in multiple books under various plotlines. Oz is made up of four divisions that surround the Emerald City in the center. The country as a whole was originally enchanted by a character named Queen Lurline, who is described in the Oz backstory. Additional characters were added in regions surrounding the Land of Oz (beyond the deserts) as the series progressed.
== Aunt Em and Uncle Henry ==
Aunt Em and Uncle Henry appear in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). They are Dorothy Gale&#x27;s guardian aunt and uncle. They live a joyless and gray life on a small farm on the prairies of Kansas. Neither of them believe their niece when she tells them she has been to the Land of Oz; they consider her a mere dreamer, as her dead mother had been. This changes when the two later face foreclosure on their farm. Dorothy arranges with Princess Ozma to bring them to Oz, so that they can escape their bleak fates and be safe and finally content. Eventually, in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910), they move permanently to Oz and take up jobs there.

== Betsy Bobbin ==
Betsy Bobbin is a fictional character in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Land of Oz. Betsy is portrayed with various hair colors throughout the series; in her initial appearances her hair was colored as blonde, strawberry blonde or light brown. Later appearances depicted her as brunette or with auburn hair. Betsy first appears in Baum&#x27;s 1913 stage play &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot;, and then in his 1914 novel &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (partly a novelization of the play), wherein she teams up with the Shaggy Man and together they go to the Nome King&#x27;s Caverns.

In the book series, Betsy arrives to Oz from Oklahoma with a mule named Hank, and she is shown as a constant companion of both Dorothy and Trot in the later books. In &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; (1917), she is said to be one year older than Dorothy Gale. Betsy is more passive than Dorothy, and in one book she is described as shy. Betsy was later made a Princess of Oz by Ruth Plumly Thompson, and she also appears as the protagonist of Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Hungry Tiger of Oz&quot; (1926) in which she helps a young prince from an Evian kingdom called Rash regain his throne from a wicked uncle.

== Billina ==

Billina is Dorothy&#x27;s pet hen on the Kansas farm and first appears in the book &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907), in which she saves the citizens of Oz from being turned into decor objects by the evil Nome King. She is sassy and talkative; at the conclusion of Ozma of Oz, Billina chooses to stay in Oz and live in the Emerald City&#x27;s royal palace, later becoming the matriarch of a large colony of chicks. She is a major character in Walt Disney&#x27;s 1985 live-action film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, in which she helps Dorothy save the Land of Oz from near extinction.

== Boq ==

Boq is a minor character who appears in the beginning of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). He is depicted as a wealthy Munchkin man with a large family who offers Dorothy Gale and Toto shelter after throwing a lavish banquet in Dorothy&#x27;s honor upon her arrival to the Land of Oz.

Boq plays a much larger role in the &quot;Wicked&quot; books (1995) and the successful Broadway musical of the same name (2003). In &quot;Wicked&quot;, Boq is a Munchkin who attends Shiz University with Elphaba and Galinda. In the musical adaptation (but not in Baum&#x27;s or Gregory Maguire&#x27;s books), Boq becomes the Tin Woodman making him a composite character.

In the musical&#x27;s two-part (2024–2025), he is portrayed by Ethan Slater and his character arc is expanded upon, complete with him being given the surname Woodsman.

== Braided Man ==

The Braided Man is a bent-over old man with his hair and beard in braids who lives halfway up Pyramid Mountain. He is a great inventor who used to live on the surface of the Earth where he worked with holes until a big one caused him to fall deep underground where he landed on Pyramid Mountain and lived on its spiral staircase since. Since then, he has amused himself by making Flutters and Rustlers.

He first appears in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; (1908) where he meets Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz when they arrive at his cave and he gives them some of his products. While he states that there is no use of money on Pyramid Mountain, he does accept Dorothy&#x27;s blue bow.

In &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909), the Braided Man appears to have made it back to the surface as he was among the guests at Princess Ozma&#x27;s birthday party. His present to Princess Ozma is the finest Flutters that he has made.

The Braided Man appears in the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. He made a background appearance at the coronation of Princess Ozma.

== Bristle ==
Bristle is a white rabbit from Bunnybury who first appears in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910). He works as the Keeper of the Wicket which is a name given to the Doorman of Bunnybury. He can only admit visitors with an order or letter of introduction from Ozma of Oz or Glinda the Good. When visitors are admitted, Bristle reduces them to the size of a rabbit before letting them into the village itself.

== Button-Bright ==
Button-Bright (real name: Saladin Paracelsus de Lambertine Evagne von Smith) first appears in the 1909 book &quot;The Road to Oz&quot;. When Button-Bright first appears, he is shown as a little boy who answers most questions with &quot;Don&#x27;t know.&quot; In the story Button&#x27;s head is temporarily changed into a fox&#x27;s head by King Dox of Foxville; upon arriving in the Land of Oz, Billina and Tik-Tok took Button-Bright to the Truth Pond so that he could regain his head. He later makes an appearance at Princess Ozma&#x27;s birthday party.

Baum brought Button-Bright back for his 1912 novel &quot;Sky Island&quot;, where he encounters Trot and Cap&#x27;n Bill for the first time. In this novel he is shown to be older and more verbal. Button reveals that he is from Philadelphia, and that his real name is Saladin Paracelsus de Lambertine Evagne von Smith. He was given the nickname &quot;Button-Bright&quot; by his parents as his name is rather long, and because they think that he is &quot;bright as a button&quot;. In &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot; (1915), Button-Bright becomes the first American to accidentally emigrate to the Land of Oz.

In the sequel Oz books, he is often the main character in subplots that deal with him getting lost and being found again. In the non-canon stories of March Laumer, Button-Bright is depicted as an adult and married to Glinda. In the &quot;Dorothy Must Die&quot; multi-volume series, he is married to Polychrome.

Button-Bright appears in the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot; in the background at Princess Ozma&#x27;s coronation.

== Cap&#x27;n Bill ==
Cap&#x27;n Bill Weedles is a fictional character who first appears in two of Baum&#x27;s fantasy novels, &quot;The Sea Fairies&quot; (1911) and &quot;Sky Island&quot; (1912). Bill was introduced along with his friend Trot; they both later appear in &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot; (1915) which is the ninth book in the Oz series.

Cap&#x27;n Bill Weedles is an ex-sailor with a wooden left leg from the knee down. His head is almost bald and what little hair he has is grizzled. His eyes are pale blue with a gentle look to them, and his face is round, rugged, and bronzed. He has been Trot&#x27;s companion from birth as he was her mother&#x27;s star boarder. Formerly he was captain of a schooner with Trot&#x27;s father as his mate; after losing his leg, the Cap&#x27;n retired, and Trot&#x27;s father was promoted to captain of the same ship.

Cap&#x27;n Bill and Trot also play significant roles in the later Oz books &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; (1917), &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot; (1919) and Jack Snow&#x27;s &quot;The Magical Mimics in Oz&quot; (1946). Baum borrowed from one of his own earlier characters, Naboth Perkins in &quot;Sam Steele&#x27;s Adventures on Land and Sea&quot; (1906), to create Cap&#x27;n Bill.

Cap&#x27;n Bill appears in the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, in the background at Princess Ozma&#x27;s coronation, holding the Magic Flower.

== Cayke ==
Cayke the Cookie Cook is a character who appears in the book &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; (1917). She is a Yip, a resident of a remote plateau in Oz who is noted for the delicious cookies she bakes in her diamond-studded gold dishpan. Cayke knows that the dishpan has magic powers; she admits to the Frogman that without it she is a poor cook, and her cookies are &quot;pretty poor stuff and no better than any woman could make who does not own [her] diamond-studded gold dishpan.&quot; However, she has no idea that her magic dishpan can carry its occupants anywhere they desire to go. Ugu the shoemaker steals Cayke&#x27;s dishpan and uses it to kidnap Ozma and steal all the magic in the Land of Oz.

When Cayke discovers her dishpan has gone missing, she is greatly distressed, and causes quite a fuss by wailing and screaming. After the Frogman, who is thought to be extremely wise by all of the Yips, tells her that the dishpan has been stolen by someone outside of the country of the Yips, she leaves the plateau where the Yips live and travels the general land of Oz to find it. This trip makes her the first Yip to leave the plateau. Though the Frogman joins her, she was prepared to go alone, showing her courage and determination. Cayke is a relatively simple woman, but she is honest except when the truth will hurt someone&#x27;s feelings, and seems to be generally good natured, if a little ill-tempered at times.

According to Cayke, the diamond-studded gold dishpan has been passed down in her family, from her mother and all of her grandmothers since the beginning of time; but its origin is never disclosed. Cayke makes a brief appearance in Jeff Freedman&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;The Magic Dishpan of Oz&quot; (her dishpan plays a much greater role there).

== China Princess ==
The China Princess is a delicate and beautiful figurine made of china who appears in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). She lives in the tiny hidden enclave called &quot;Dainty China Country&quot; in the Quadling Country of the Land of Oz. She, like all the other china people, cannot leave their enclave or they will become lifeless and stiff.

The China Princess appears in the 2013 film &quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot; voiced by Megan Hilty.

== Cowardly Lion ==
The Cowardly Lion is a talking lion who lives in the Land of Oz. He appears in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) and becomes one of Dorothy Gale&#x27;s first companions in Oz, joining her and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman as he is in search of courage. At the end of the book, he becomes King of the Beasts in the dark forest in Oz&#x27;s southern quadrant called Quadling Country, though this is rarely brought up in later Oz books.

In the sequels, he appears in minor roles as Ozma&#x27;s bodyguard and beast of burden, along with the Hungry Tiger.

In Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Cowardly Lion of Oz&quot; (1923), a lion collector named King Mustafa seeks to capture him, while he seeks to restore his courage.

== Dorothy Gale ==
Dorothy Gale is the main character and adolescent protagonist in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) and several sequel Oz books. She is a heroic and sweet-tempered orphan girl from a small farm on the prairies of Kansas. Baum never reveals Dorothy&#x27;s age, but she is thought to be no older than twelve years old. In appearance she is described as having chubby little hands, a round rosy face, big earnest eyes filled with awe and a merry laugh. She has a small pet dog Toto, whom she loves dearly. After her first adventure in the Land of Oz, she returns to Kansas via the charmed Silver Shoes (Ruby Slippers in the classic MGM musical of 1939) she obtained while there but lost between worlds when she was teleported back. Not much later, she unexpectedly returns to Oz again, thus having several more adventures before permanently settling there as an official princess of Oz in the book &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910).

== Dr. Pipt ==
Dr. Pipt is sometimes called the Crooked Magician. He first appears in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913). He is so crooked that his legs are nearly as handy as his arms. When he sits, one knee is under his chin and the other behind his back. Dr. Pipt lives in the Munchkin Country with his wife Margolotte. He is notable for creating the Patchwork Girl (who was created by Dr. Pipt&#x27;s wife, Margolotte) and the Glass Cat.

Dr. Pipt also invented the Powder of Life (although in the 1904 novel &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; this invention is credited to another crooked magician named Dr. Nikidik). In an article in the Spring 1965 issue of &quot;The Baum Bugle,&quot; Lee Speth argues that Nikidik faked his death in the earlier book, to assume a new identity as Pipt.

He was deprived of his magic abilities by Glinda for doing magic without a permit. Glinda also straightened his crooked limbs.

In &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; (1917), Dr. Pipt assists Ojo and Unc Nunkie in a search party that is organized to find Princess Ozma.

Dr. Pipt appears in the 2017 series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot; voiced by J. P. Karliak.

== Ervic ==
Ervic is a major character in &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot; (1920). Displaying &quot;courage, cleverness, and ingenuity,&quot; Ervic is often considered one of Baum&#x27;s strongest male characters (as the author&#x27;s male characters often tend to be ineffectual).

When Queen Coo-ee-oh launches her submarine attack on the Flatheads, Ervic is one of the young men in her flagship. The Flatheads quickly dispatch with Coo-ee-oh, as they simply wanted revenge on her personally, but as she is the only one who knows the magic to get back to the submerged city, the young men sit in the boat, unsure what to do. Ervic is approached by the Three Adepts at Magic who are stranded in the form of fish. They wish him to catch them in a bucket and to follow their instructions, and that if he does so, he will save himself, his city, and his companions. They help him get the boat to shore and have him carry the bucket to Reera the Red. Reera is a beautiful young woman who practices Yookoohoo (transformation-only) magic for her own amusement. Reera is interested by his impertinence with her, and Ervic very shrewdly manipulates her into restoring the Adepts to human form, taking quite a bit of time and waiting for her to ask permission to transform them several times. The Adepts are able to assist the raising of the city, and with Coo-ee-oh gone, Lady Aurex is named Queen of the Skeezers by Princess Ozma, and for his valor, Aurex names Ervic her Prime Minister.

== Eureka ==
Eureka is a white kitten who is introduced in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; (1908). She is found by Uncle Henry who gives her the name Eureka, which means &quot;I have found it!&quot; Henry then gives the cat to his niece Dorothy making the cat her pet. Dorothy carries Eureka in a small birdcage on a train with her to San Francisco to visit her relatives on Hugson farm. While riding with Bill Hugson&#x27;s nephew Zeb, an earthquake opens a large chasm in the ground, and Eureka falls with Dorothy, Zeb, and Jim the Cab-Horse into the land of the Mangaboos, people made of vegetable. The strange lights in the Mangaboos&#x27; cavern create all sorts of odd colors, and Eureka looks pink there. Eureka is then referred to as a &quot;pink kitten,&quot; or sometimes, as in &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot; (1920), as a &quot;purple kitten.&quot;

The last third of &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; presents her as dishonest, and she is placed on trial for having eaten the smallest of the Nine Tiny Piglets, which was given to Princess Ozma as a pet. Eureka is threatened with execution until the piglet is finally found. Although Eureka ultimately tells them where the piglet is, she is amused at being tried for something that is in her nature to attempt. Eureka returns with Dorothy to Kansas, but is later found living in Oz with no explanation of how she returned. Eureka may be conniving and deceitful, but overall she has a good heart.

Eureka plays a significant supporting role in Dick Martin&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;The Ozmapolitan of Oz&quot;, and she is the heroine of Chris Dulabone&#x27;s &quot;The Colorful Kitten of Oz&quot; (1990) which, among other things, addresses the inconsistency of Eureka&#x27;s color. Eureka appears in the 2017 series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot; voiced by Kari Wahlgren. She is a resident of Purrville who becomes friends with the Cowardly Lion.

== Evoldo ==
Evoldo is the late king of the Land of Ev, a monarchy across the Deadly Desert from Oz. He is discussed and pictured in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907), but has died before the adventure takes place. Evoldo was a cruel despot; after purchasing Tik-Tok, the clockwork man, and giving him his name, Evoldo sold his wife and ten children (five boys, five girls) to the Nome King in exchange for a long life. Later, regretting this bargain, he locked Tik-Tok in a stone chamber and committed suicide by jumping into the Nonestic Ocean.

== Foolish Owl ==
The Foolish Owl is a great blue owl that lives in Munchkin Country and speaks in nonsense poetry. She and the Wise Donkey serve as public advisors.

She first appears in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913) where Patchwork Girl, Ojo, and Glass Cat stop by the office of the Foolish Owl and the Wise Donkey where they knew about their current mission.

== Frogman ==

The Frogman is a human-sized frog who appears as a character who is first introduced in &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; (1917). He was once an ordinary frog and his similarity to Professor Woggle-Bug is rather clear. Though unlike the Woggle-Bug, Frogman is not thoroughly educated and is much more interested in dandy fashion. He accidentally bathes in the Truth Pond and is thereafter magically compelled to speak only the truth.

In &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot; (1919), Frogman is among the guests at Princess Ozma&#x27;s birthday party.

In 1986, March Laumer made him, with the proper name Frederick Fraukx, the title character of &quot;The Frogman of Oz: The Oz Book for 1947&quot;, along with a U.S. Navy frogman. The Frogman is a crucial character in Jeff Freedman&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;The Magic Dishpan of Oz&quot;.

The Frogman appears in the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. He is seen in the background at the coronation of Princess Ozma.

== Fyter the Tin Soldier ==
Captain Fyter the Tin Soldier is a character who is first introduced in &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; (1918). After the Tin Woodman left his beloved Nimmie Amee after losing his heart (as he felt he could not love her), Fyter, a member of the Munchkin army, met and fell in love with her when he found her crying over her lost love. Unfortunately, she was a ward to the Wicked Witch of the East, who made Fyter&#x27;s sword do what the Woodman&#x27;s axe did and cut off his limbs, which Ku-Klip the tin smith replaced with tin limbs (although Fyter is not bothered by his lack of a heart). Nimmie Amee agreed to marry him, but on the day of their wedding, a storm rose up, and the rain rusted Fyter so badly that he was frozen in place along a little used forest path. There he stood for years until he was discovered by the Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, Woot the Wanderer, and Polychrome the Rainbow&#x27;s Daughter. 

Once lubricated and restored to life, Fyter accompanies the group of adventurers on their quest to find Nimmie Amee, intending to fulfill his vow of marriage (although he is willing to give her up if she chooses the Woodman over him). When they finally find her, she is happily married to Chopfyt, the assembled and combined &quot;meat&quot; parts of the two men. Finding Nimmie Amee happily married, they return to the Emerald City where Captain Fyter joins the Royal Army of Oz. Eventually, Ozma sends Fyter to keep order among the wild inhabitants of the unknown areas of the Gillikin Country.

== Gayelette ==
Gayelette was an ancient princess and sorceress who lived in a ruby palace in the northern quadrant called Gillikin Country of the Land of Oz, introduced in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). She was the original owner and creator of the charmed Golden Cap which had a curse cast upon it that compelled the creatures called Winged monkeys long before the Wicked Witch of the West surfaced.

Gayelette was featured in Roger S. Baum&#x27;s &quot;Dorothy of Oz&quot; (1989) where she was the boss of the Jester before he became possessed by the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s ghost.

== Glass Cat ==

Bungle the Glass Cat is a cat made of glass who was brought to life by the &quot;Powder of Life&quot; in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913). She is portrayed as vain and aloof, due to the fact that she has clearly visible pink brains and a transparent glass heart.

== Glinda the Good Witch of the South ==
The Good Witch of the South is named Glinda, and appears at the end of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). She is the sorceress who rules over the southern quadrant called Quadling Country in the Land of Oz. Her overall character is a figure that many of the other Oz characters consult when in trouble or in need of any assistance. Glinda is described as being highly intelligent, wise and independent. Outwardly, she is very beautiful despite the hundreds of years she has lived and is always honest, kind and gentle to everyone who encounters her. She also is one of the most powerful and respected women in Oz and the official protector of Oz&#x27;s rightful ruler, the child Queen Princess Ozma. She became the official ruler of the southern quadrant called Quadling Country in the Land of Oz, after she vanquished the Wicked Witch of the South (previous ruler).

== Good Witch of the North ==

The Good Witch of the North appears in the beginning of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). She is the first witch Dorothy Gale encounters upon her unexpected arrival to the Land of Oz. She is the official ruler of Oz&#x27;s northern quadrant called Gillikin Country but is a very dear friend to the Munchkins. She is described as being very old in appearance and has a jolly and humble personality. She wears a magic white hat that can transform into a magic chalkboard, which she can consult for advice. After Dorothy&#x27;s farmhouse landed in Munchkin Country and killed the Wicked Witch of the East, the Good Witch of the North gives Dorothy the dead witch&#x27;s charmed Silver Shoes and kisses her on the forehead for protection while on her journey. She is mentioned in the book &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909), but does not physically feature again until Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Giant Horse of Oz&quot; (1928).

While Baum did not name the character in his novels, she is referred to as Locasta in the 1902 musical. When Thompson brought the character back in &quot;The Giant Horse of Oz&quot;, she was named Tattypoo.

== Guardian of the Gates ==

The Guardian of the Gates is a character in several of the Oz books. He is never known by any other name, but he is depicted as a singular character who lives in a small room, based on its description significantly larger than a standard guardhouse, in the wall that surrounds the Emerald City. In &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) and &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904), his job is to adorn green spectacle glasses around the heads of all visitors to the Emerald City before they enter. It is claimed that this is done to protect their eyes from the thousands of glittering green gems within the city that are so precious and rare, they would cause blindness without the spectacles. In fact Oz is &quot;no more green than any other city&quot; and it is yet another &quot;humbug&quot; created by the Wizard. The glasses can only be unlocked by a solid gold key that the Guardian always wears on a thick gold chain around his neck.

After &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; he abandoned the practice, for General Jinjur&#x27;s Army of Revolt and Tippetarius had all entered the city without damage to their eyes. The Guardian of the Gates appears only occasionally after this book, and his duty becomes significantly lighter.

In &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913) when Ojo the Lucky reaches the city, he and his companions are taken into the Guardian&#x27;s room, where the Soldier with the Green Whiskers tells the Guardian of the Gates that he has a note from Ozma that Ojo is to be taken prisoner. So the Guardian of the Gates removes the traditional prison garb, a white robe that completely covers the prisoner, from a closet and places it on Ojo and leaves the Soldier with the Green Whiskers in charge of him.

In John R. Neill&#x27;s Oz books, the Guardian of the Gates and the Soldier with the Green Whiskers are frequently shown as friends, but the subsequent books of Jack Snow give the duty to Omby Amby (the Soldier&#x27;s name), and there is no entry for the Guardian of the Gates in Snow&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Oz&quot;. In Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Scalawagons of Oz&quot; (1941), the Guardian mentions a desire to visit his cousin, Oompa, which may explain, in-universe, why Omby Amby is fulfilling that function while the other man was on vacation. Further confusion is created in the MGM movie, in which both roles are played by Frank Morgan, and publicity referred to the Guardian&#x27;s equivalent as &quot;the Doorman&quot; and the Soldier&#x27;s equivalent as &quot;the Guard&quot;. No other Guardian of the Gates is described in any of Baum&#x27;s books, aside from a stout woman who takes over the function during Jinjur&#x27;s rule. 

The Guardian of the Gates had his own eponymous song, written in bass clef, in the 1902 &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; musical extravaganza, by Baum and composer Paul Tietjens, but it was cut after only two performances and never made it to Broadway, although the sheet music was published for consumer use.

In the 1939 adaption of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Guardian of the Gates appears as the &quot;Gatekeeper&quot; portrayed by Frank Morgan (who also portrays Professor Marvelous, the Wizard of Oz, the Emerald City Coachman, and the Guard). When Dorothy, Toto, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion reach the Emerald City, they ring on the bell which alerted the Gatekeeper. When he notices that there is no sign near the bell and puts it up before closing the door&#x27;s window where it says &quot;Bell out of order. Please knock.&quot; They knock which pleases the Gatekeeper and were able to persuade him into letting them go to the Wizard by showing the Ruby Slippers that Dorothy has. The Gatekeeper lets them into the Emerald City.

Many film and television adaptations conflate Omby Amby and the Gatekeeper for convenience. An example is the 2013 film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;, in which Bruce Campbell plays an unnamed character who exhibits traits of both men.

In the 2005 TV-movie &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;, Sam the Eagle portrays &quot;the Gate Guard.&quot;

In the 2015 adaptation &quot;The Wiz Live!&quot;, Common portrays &quot;The Bouncer / The Gatekeeper of the Entrance to the Emerald City.&quot;

== Gugu ==
Gugu is an enormous leopard that rules the Forest of Gugu in Gillikin Country wisely and responsibly. In &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot; (1919), Gugu was transformed into a fat Gillikin woman when Ruggedo and Kiki Aru in the form of the Li-Mon-Eags trick the inhabitants into thinking that the Emerald City wants to conquer the Forest of Gugu. When Kiki Aru and Ruggedo are defeated, Gugu is restored to normal by the Wizard of Oz.

== The Gump ==

The Gump is an amalgam of parts with the mounted head of an elk-like creature, first brought to life with the magic Powder of Life in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904). Wogglebug combined the head with two sofas for a body, palm trees for wings, and a broom for a tail: all tied together with clothesline and ropes. After crashing into a jackdaw&#x27;s nest, Wogglebug used a Wishing Pill to fix him. After the Land of Oz is retaken by Princess Ozma, the Gump is disassembled at his request leaving him a talking head that is still living in the Royal Palace of Oz.

The Gump also appeared in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; (1908) where he meets and talks to Dorothy until Ozma arrives.

The Gump is a central character in Disney&#x27;s 1985 live action fantasy film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, performed and voiced by Lyle Conway and assisted in the performance by Steve Norrington. Depicted somewhat like a green-furred moose, this Gump is assembled by Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and Billina, with Dorothy Gale applying the Powder of Life. This Gump escapes Mombi and survives the Nome King ordeal.

== Hank ==
Hank is a mule that is the pet and companion of Betsy Bobbin, first seen in &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914).

== Hungry Tiger ==

The Hungry Tiger is a massive Bengal tiger who is friends with the Cowardly Lion. He is always hungry no matter how much he eats and longs to eat a &quot;fat baby,&quot; though he never would because his conscience will not allow him to do so. At the banquet in the Emerald City at the end of &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907), he acknowledges that he is finally full.

The Hungry Tiger was introduced in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; as one of Princess Ozma&#x27;s chariot drivers (the other being the Cowardly Lion), though Jack Snow and others believe he may be &quot;the biggest of the tigers&quot; in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900).

In Chapter 18 of &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913), he is described as &quot;the largest and most powerful of its kind,&quot; and having come from the forest where the Cowardly Lion ruled, which could be taken as an indirect statement that he is the same tiger that appeared in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900).

In &quot;The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger,&quot; one of Baum&#x27;s &quot;Little Wizard Stories of Oz&quot; (1914), the title characters go on a misadventure in which the Tiger&#x27;s refusal to eat a fat baby is put to the test.

Ruth Plumly Thompson gave the Tiger his own adventure in &quot;The Hungry Tiger of Oz&quot; (1926).

The Hungry Tiger appears in &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry: Back to Oz&quot;, voiced by Andrea Martin. This version is a female, and has a more anthropomorphic appearance than the literary version.

The Hungry Tiger appears in the 2017 series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, voiced by Bill Fagerbakke.

== Jack Pumpkinhead ==

Jack Pumpkinhead first appears in the second Oz book &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904). When Mombi animates a stick figure with a pumpkin for a head using the magic potion called &quot;Powder of Life&quot;, it comes to life and is named Jack, who then becomes friends with Mombi&#x27;s slave named Tip. He then becomes Tip&#x27;s companion for the rest of the book, and appears in several sequel books thereafter, including a titular appearance in Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz&quot; (1929).

== Jellia Jamb ==
Jellia Jamb, aka the &quot;pretty green girl&quot;, is the head maid of the Emerald City&#x27;s royal palace. She first appears in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) and is first named in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904). Jellia Jamb is portrayed as a rather sweet and organized girl when on duty, but mischievous and playful when off duty. She is said to be very pretty, with green hair and green eyes. Her name is a pun on &quot;jelly or jam&quot;, a phrase from a question that a maid might traditionally ask a young child when preparing bread for a snack.

== Jim the Cab-Horse ==
Jim the Cab-Horse is a character in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; (1908). Jim is depicted as an emaciated steed. He was originally charged with taking Dorothy home from the train station by pulling a carriage driven by Dorothy&#x27;s cousin Zeb Hugson. When a giant earthquake occurs, Jim and the occupants of his carriage fall deep into the earth and into the Land of the Mangaboos. As they enter a fairy country, Jim gains the ability to speak.

Throughout most of the book, Jim pulls the buggy that carries Dorothy, Zeb, and the Wizard of Oz. He is occasionally unhitched from his carriage when it is too cumbersome for the carriage to be pulled or when the travellers must rely on Jim&#x27;s powerful hooves to fight against creatures such as gargoyles. Upon arriving in Oz, he is regarded as an oddity because nobody has ever seen a flesh-and-blood horse; the only horse they have seen is the Saw-horse. He is treated as an honoured guest in the Emerald City and becomes somewhat haughty, bragging that he was a fast racehorse in his youth. However, his pride is hurt after losing a race to the Saw-horse and frequently asks Zeb when they will be able to return to Hugson&#x27;s Ranch. His wish is granted at the end of the book, when Ozma uses the magic belt to return Zeb and Jim to California.

== Jinjur ==

Jinjur is the petulant head of an all female army of revolt. She and her similarly-discontented female soldiers attempt to overthrow the Emerald City and install Jinjur as the ruler of Oz in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904), but her regiment is scared away by scampering mice sent by the Mouse Queen. She also appears in several other Oz books. Her name is a pun on the word &quot;ginger&quot;, which is &quot;hot&quot;, like her temper.

== Kalidah ==
The Kalidahs are a fictitious species of animal in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). They are mentioned and featured in the first half of the story when Dorothy Gale and her companions are traveling through the dark forest. A Kalidah is characterized as a ferocious monster having the head of a tiger and the body of a bear.

Although two Kalidahs are seemingly killed in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (after falling into a ravine and being dashed to pieces on the rocks at the bottom), Baum had decided by &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot; (1919) that the inhabitants of Oz are immortal, so a Kalidah, though pierced through the heart, survives.

Other Kalidahs appear in &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot;, where they bother Trot and Cap&#x27;n Bill. In &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913), Dr. Pipt keeps Kalidahs struck with his Liquid of Petrefaction by the entrance to his house. The creatures play an important part in Eric Shanower&#x27;s &quot;Gugu and the Kalidahs.&quot; Phyllis Ann Karr&#x27;s short story &quot;The Guardian Dove,&quot; published in the 1990 issue of &quot;Oziana&quot;, provides a detailed treatment of Kalidah culture.

The 1975 stage musical &quot;The Wiz&quot; includes a musical number &quot;Kalidah Battle,&quot; featuring the Kalidah Queen and two of her gang. In the film adaptation of &quot;The Wiz&quot;, the Kalidahs are two red paper lantern-alike marionettes controlled by the Subway Peddler, the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s henchman. During the attack in the New York City Subway, it&#x27;s shown that the Kalidahs are able to separate from their strings, become two meters high and chase anyone the Peddler wants. After the Wicked Witch of West is defeated, when her henchmen (the Peddler included) and her slaves turn into Winkies by tearing their costumes and burning them, the Kalidahs may be destroyed in the process.

In the 2005 TV-movie &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Kalidahs are portrayed by Statler and Waldorf.

== Kaliko ==
Kaliko is a Nome and lives in the Nome Kingdom, where he is, at least to start off with, the Chief Steward to his sadistic master, the Nome King Roquat the Red. Kaliko is first encountered in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907), though he is identified only as the Chief Steward. In the book, Dorothy&#x27;s pet hen Billina overheard an argument between Kaliko and Roquat, and learned the secret. She was able to set the prisoners free. In &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910), Roquat the Red plans to attack the Emerald City in revenge for his humiliation; we see Kaliko only very briefly.

The character of Kaliko is in his prime in &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914). Kaliko become king after old Ruggedo (whose name was changed from Roquat) was expelled from his kingdom by the Great Jinjin Tititihoochoo for tipping some members of a Rescue Expedition from Oz down a Hollow Tube and straight into the Land of the Fairies, which is under the governorship of Tititihoochoo. Kaliko promises to become a good king and offers to assist in rescuing the Shaggy Man&#x27;s brother. Ruggedo returns to the Nome Kingdom, and Kaliko takes him in upon Ruggedo&#x27;s promise to be good.

Kaliko has a brief role in &quot;Rinkitink in Oz&quot; (1916), where he helps the cruel King Gos and Queen Cor hide the captive rulers of Pingaree from their &quot;wizard&quot; son Prince Inga and his friend Rinkitink of Gilgad. Kaliko is essentially a good-natured person still, but refuses to surrender the prisoners upon Inga&#x27;s arrival as he feels himself bound to his promise made to Gos and Cor. However, Dorothy and the Wizard arrive from Oz and force Kaliko to give up the prisoners.

Kaliko makes some more appearances in the later Oz books of Ruth Plumly Thompson, including &quot;The Hungry Tiger of Oz&quot; (1926), &quot;The Gnome King of Oz&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Wishing Horse of Oz&quot; (1935), where he appears to have changed from a &quot;good&quot; Nome into a cruel Nome who harbors plans to rule Oz for himself, and adds himself to the list of Princess Ozma&#x27;s enemies. He, like all other Nomes, is afraid of eggs; and once he becomes king, he is a self-confessed &quot;powerful sorcerer.&quot;

== Kiki Aru ==
Kiki Aru is a Munchkin from the Hyup community on Mount Munch who appears in &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot; (1919). He is the son of Bini Aru who learned the transformation magic by saying the magic word &quot;Pyrzqxgl.&quot;

When Princess Ozma made a decree that limits who can learn magic, Kiki discovered the words and used it to turn into a hawk where he flew to the Land of Ev. After being reprimanded by a sparrow for stealing a coin in the form of a magpie, Kiki was approached by the former Nome King Ruggedo who ropes Kiki into helping him with his plot. Transforming themselves into birds, Kiki and Ruggedo flew to the Land of Oz to avoid being detected by the Great Book of Records. Upon transforming themselves into Li-Mon-Eags (creatures with the head of a lion, the body of a monkey, the wings of an eagle, and the knob-tipped tail of a donkey) who claim to be from Sky Island, Kiki and Ruggedo spread the rumors to the animals of the Forest of Gugu that the humans of Oz plan to harm their forest. This was thwarted by the Wizard who used the magic word to turn Kiki and Ruggedo into different nuts. After being restored to normal, Kiki and Ruggedo were hit with a thirst-inducing magic and drank from the forbidden fountain where they lost their memories and their evil intentions.

== King Krewl ==
King Krewl is an evil dictator who appears in &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot; (1915). He previously ruled over Jinxland in the Quadling Country before being deposed.

In the 1914 film &quot;His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz&quot;, he was played by Raymond Russell.

In the 1925 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, he was played by Josef Swickard.

== King of Bunnybury ==
The King of Bunnybury is a white rabbit who rules Bunnybury as seen in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910). As king, he is very unhappy where he is not being allowed to run wild and free like the other rabbits. He is shown to have an attendant named Blinkem.

== King of the Fairy Beavers ==
The King of the Fairy Beavers appears in Baum&#x27;s &quot;John Dough and the Cherub&quot; (1906) and reappears in Jack Snow&#x27;s &quot;The Shaggy Man of Oz&quot; (1949). The King of the Fairy Beavers rules an underground kingdom. In both books, he helps the travelers to reach their final destination.

== King Pastoria ==

King Pastoria was the rightful King of Oz until he was removed from power by Mombi. He is the father of Princess Ozma. The character is mentioned in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904), but does not appear in Baum&#x27;s books. He is introduced to the series in Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s 1925 novel, &quot;The Lost King of Oz&quot;.

== Ku-Klip ==
Ku-Klip is a character who is the originally unnamed tinsmith in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) who provided Nick Chopper with tin prostheses when the latter was cursed to dismember himself by the Wicked Witch of the East because of his love for the servant Nimmie Amee. In &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; (1918), we are introduced to a soldier named Captain Fyter, who met with the same fate due to his interest in Nimmie Amee, and Ku-Klip did the same for him.

After the witch was destroyed by Dorothy Gale&#x27;s house, Ku-Klip entered the witch&#x27;s house and took some of her magical devices, including a magic glue. He had thrown Chopper and Fyter&#x27;s discarded body parts into a barrel, and decided to use this glue (originally referred to as &quot;Meat Glue&quot; in early editions of the book, but later changed) to assemble the parts from two men into a man called Chopfyt, but he finds he must substitute a tin arm as well. Nimmie Amee marries the assemblage and appears to be quite happy, but Princess Ozma takes the witch&#x27;s tools away from the smith so that he cannot create any more unnatural beings. Ku-Klip continues to keep Nick Chopper&#x27;s flesh head, who finds the Tin Woodman&#x27;s claim to be him ludicrous, in a cabinet.

== Lonesome Duck ==
The Lonesome Duck is a character in &quot;The Magic of Oz&quot; (1919); he makes brief but gaudy appearances in two of the book&#x27;s later chapters.

The Lonesome Duck first appears when Cap&#x27;n Bill and Trot are trapped on the Magic Isle in the Gillikin Country. He swims &quot;swiftly and gracefully&quot; over to them, astonishing them with his &quot;gorgeously colored plumage&quot;. In a brief conversation, the Duck explains why he is lonesome. Though he cannot help free the two protagonists from their entrapment, he makes it slightly easier to bear, by conjuring large magic toadstools for them to sit on. Later, the rescue party searching for Trot and Cap&#x27;n Bill almost stumbles over the Lonesome Duck&#x27;s diamond palace, earning them a stern rebuke from its inhabitant.

== Mombi ==

Mombi is one of the series&#x27; major antagonists. The character was originally presented as a lowly hag who had enchanted Princess Ozma in order to prevent her from ascending to the throne. Mombi first appears &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904), when Tip escapes her power. Later in the series, L. Frank Baum specified that she had once conquered and ruled the Gillikin Country as the Wicked Witch of the North only to be deposed by Locasta, the Good Witch of the North.

It is revealed that she helped install the Wizard as ruler of Oz. In Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Lost King of Oz&quot; (1925), she is a primary antagonist. In a similar fate to her predecessor, the Wicked Witch of the West, Mombi is melted by water, but in John R. Neill&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Bucky in Oz&quot; (1942) she is accidentally resurrected by Jack Pumpkinhead and becomes a secondary antagonist.

== Mr. Yoop ==
Mr. Yoop is a giant from &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913). He is a 21 ft. giant with a ravenous appetite for meat people and an orange marmalade. Mr. Yoop ate cows and sheep and sometimes knocked over people&#x27;s houses which led to him being apprehended and imprisoned in a mountain cave making him the largest untamed giant in captivity. Since his imprisonment, he has only eaten six ants and a monkey. He threatens passers-by: &quot;They tell me meat is going up, but if I can manage to catch you, I&#x27;m sure it will soon be going down.&quot;

The book &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; (1918) revealed that he is the estranged husband of Mrs. Yoop and has been abusive towards her.

== Mrs. Yoop ==
Mrs. Yoop is a wicked giantess and sorceress in &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; (1918). When she meets the Tin Woodman and his companions, she changes them into animal forms. She transforms Polychrome into a canary, the Tin Woodman into a tin owl, the Scarecrow into a stuffed brown bear, and Woot the Wanderer into a green monkey. She is the estranged wife of the imprisoned Mr. Yoop from &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913), who has been imprisoned for eating people. Unlike him, Mrs. Yoop is not a cannibal; she obtains food by means of her magical powers. The Green Monkey Spell proves irreversible and has to be transferred to somebody else. In this case Mrs. Yoop who becomes, and must now stay, a green monkey. She is a Yookoohoo, a special kind of witch, &quot;an Artist of Transformations&quot; whose enchantments are extremely powerful. The other Yookoohoo in the Oz books is Red Reera in &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot; (1920). Both Yookoohoos are specialists in magical transformations and are solitary, anti-social, and fiercely independent. &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; is a rarity in Baum&#x27;s Oz canon, in that the author&#x27;s manuscript of the book exists, and reveals the changes that Baum made for the printed version. Baum revised his original to make Mrs. Yoop more sinister; and he originally called Mrs. Yoop a &quot;Whisp&quot; (an otherwise unknown term in the universe of Oz) rather than a Yookoohoo.

== Nimmie Amee ==

Nimmie Amee is the Munchkin maiden whom the Tin Woodman once loved in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). She was not named until &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; (1918), as Nick Chopper never went to find her after the Wizard gave him a &quot;kind&quot; but not a &quot;loving&quot; heart, until that novel&#x27;s protagonist, Woot the Wanderer, encouraged him to do so.

In &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Tin Woodman tells Dorothy Gale and the Scarecrow that the lady was a servant for an old woman who did not wish her to marry, and so sought the aid of the Wicked Witch of the East to place a spell on him that caused him to cut himself up with his axe while carrying on his livelihood. In &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot;, this was retconned, and in Nick&#x27;s new telling, she was directly enslaved by the Witch herself.

Nimmie Amee was aware of the spell, which occurred gradually, and was not bothered by his condition and still wished to marry him, but he lost interest when he lost his heart (In &quot;Wizard&quot;, he lost his heart after his head; in &quot;Tin Woodman&quot;, he lost his head last and the Witch ran around with it in her arms). Soon a soldier named Captain Fyter also wooed the lady, and the Witch dealt him the same blow, and he sought help from the same tinsmith, Ku-Klip. Fyter&#x27;s head and parts of Nick and his body were incorporated into Chopfyt, a new person, through the use of magic glue found in the Witch&#x27;s house. Ku-Klip was unable to find one arm, so he fashioned one out of tin. In this way, Chopfyt reminded her of both the men she loved, and she married him, and Baum presented them as a happy couple at the end of the novel, although Princess Ozma forbade Ku-Klip from ever doing such a thing again.

== Nome King ==

The Nome King (also referred to as Roquat, and later Ruggedo) is the evil and humorously stubborn ruler of an underground kingdom inhabited by the race of gnome minions, creatures who are half human and half rock. His mountain stands between the Land of Oz and the Land of Ev and is separated from both these two countries by the vast Deadly Desert. He appears in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907) and several of the sequel Oz books. His evil plans usually involve kidnapping the rulers of Oz or taking over the universe. Even after he is deposed and defeated in &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914), he continues to make trouble for the inhabitants of Oz and all the Ozians in general. After a number of attempts on Oz&#x27;s peace and happiness in Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Kabumpo in Oz&quot; (1922), &quot;The Gnome King of Oz&quot; (1927) and &quot;Pirates in Oz&quot; (1931), he meets his final canonical fate in &quot;Handy Mandy in Oz&quot; (1937).

== Ojo the Lucky ==

Ojo the Lucky is a Munchkin who appears in several Oz books, including &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913) and &quot;Ojo in Oz&quot;.

He first appeared in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot;. Ojo is a Munchkin who lived with his uncle, Unc Nunkie, in the Blue Forest, a remote location in the north of the Munchkin Country. During a trip with his uncle to visit his uncle&#x27;s friend Dr. Pipt, Ojo learns from Pipt&#x27;s wife, Dame Margolotte, that he is known to others as &quot;Ojo the Unlucky.&quot; Ojo discovers rationalizations for this, including the fact that he was born on Friday the 13th, is left-handed, and has a wart under his arm, and he begins to believe that bad luck follows him wherever he goes. However, the Tin Woodman officially deems him Ojo the Lucky after hearing these reasons because he believes Ojo&#x27;s bad luck is due to a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Ojo later starred in his own book, &quot;Ojo in Oz&quot; (1933) by Ruth Plumly Thompson. In this book, Thompson picked up a dropped thread of Baum&#x27;s about Ojo being possibly related to royalty and made him the Prince of Seebania, whose family was enchanted by an evil sorcerer named Mooj, causing his father, King Ree Alla Bad, to run around Oz as a bandit called Realbad.

Although Ojo is a Munchkin, he seems to be taller than the Munchkins Dorothy met during her first trip to Oz, though this is never stated. It is usually surmised from a passage in which Dr. Pipt refers to Ojo getting &quot;taller,&quot; though only the comparative form of the word is used. Neither Ojo nor Unc Nunkie are described as &quot;tall&quot;.

In John R. Neill&#x27;s books, Ojo is attendant to Kabumpo. This is never explained.

== Ozma ==

Princess Ozma is the ruler of Oz since the end of the second book, and she has appeared in every book except the first. Prior to the second book, she had been transformed by the evil Mombi into a young boy named Tip. In many of the books, she is depicted as a fairy princess of fourteen or fifteen years of age, though she was originally portrayed as not a fairy and much younger. She is the title character in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907) and &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; (1917), and makes an appearance in almost every book in the Famous Forty. 

In Jack Snow&#x27;s 1958 novel &quot;A Murder in Oz&quot;, Ozma&#x27;s Tip persona reclaims his life, causing Ozma to die, and the Wizard has to find a way to have both Tip and Ozma alive and well at the same time.

== Phonograph ==
The Phonograph (also referred to as The Troublesome Phonograph) is a character who appeared in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913). It originally belonged to Dr. Pipt, until it was inadvertently brought to life when it was accidentally sprinkled with the Powder of Life. The Phonograph has a large gold-colored horn, and is screwed to a tall, four-legged table, which it uses for movement.

Once alive, it continued to bother the magician by playing loud and offensive &quot;classical&quot; music until it was at last forced from his home. It then tried to endear itself to the young Munchkin boy Ojo and his friends in much the same way (first with classical, then jazz), but was finally scared off by the Shaggy Man, who threatened to &quot;scatter its pieces across the country, as a matter of kindness to the people of Oz.&quot; The Phonograph has never been seen since.

The Phonograph&#x27;s name is Victor Columbia Edison, but was dubbed Vic for short, by the Patchwork Girl.

== Polychrome ==
Polychrome is a luminous and ethereal sky fairy and the youngest daughter of the Rainbow. She first appears in &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909). Polychrome also appears in &quot;Sky Island&quot; (1912), &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914), &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; (1918) and Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Grampa in Oz&quot; (1924).

== Princess Langwidere ==

Princess Langwidere (a pun on the term &quot;languid air&quot;, as enabled by her wealthy status and lazy carefree manner) appears in Baum&#x27;s third Oz book &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907) as a secondary villain. She is the vain and spoiled princess whom Dorothy and her company encounter when she visits the Land of Ev which neighbors Oz. Langwidere has a collection of 30 exchangeable heads she keeps in a cabinet constructed of solid gold and studded with gems. The cabinet itself is held within a walk-in closet in the boudoir of Langwidere&#x27;s palace. Each head is said to be extremely beautiful, consisting of different bone structures that represent different ethnicities and are kept in their own separate cases lined with mirrors that Langwidere keeps locked with a ruby key she wears around her left wrist. Instead of changing her clothing like most princesses, she simply changes her heads to match her current state of mood whenever she pleases. She is portrayed as being a very reclusive and selfish creature, with a terrible temper when she wears Head #17.

Langwidere has a meek-natured dutiful maid named Nanda. Upon spotting Nanda going about her duties around the castle, the Hungry Tiger regards her as exceptionally tasty-looking and eagerly requests her permission to eat her; being denied this privilege, he instead asks Nanda to whip up a sumptuous beef-and-potatoes feast for him, which she shakily agrees to, as her doing so will mean that she will both escape undevoured and temporarily take the edge off the Tiger&#x27;s voracious appetite.

In the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, elements of Princess Langwidere were combined with the witch Mombi and is named Princess Mombi instead. She is an ally of the Nome King.

In the 2017 series Lost in Oz, though she doesn&#x27;t appear directly, Langwidere is the real name of the Wicked Witch of the East, who in turn is the great great aunt of the original Wicked of the East.

== Queen Ann Soforth ==
Queen Ann Soforth is the ruler of Oogaboo who first appeared in &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914). The small fictional kingdom of &quot;Oogaboo&quot; is separated by a mountain range from the rest of the Winkie Country in the Land of Oz. Oogaboo is the smallest and poorest kingdom in Oz, despite the cultivation of trees which produce many items of value.

== Queen Coo-ee-oh ==
Queen Coo-ee-oh was the Queen of the Skeezers in &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot; (1920). Shortly after she is introduced, as an arrogant girl of about fifteen or sixteen, who proclaims herself the only Krumbic witch in the world, for she invented the art, the Su Dic of the Flatheads attacks her island kingdom, and she leads the defense aboard a submarine that opens into a boat. There a bucket of enchanted water is dumped upon her, and she becomes a vain, diamond-eyed swan with no memory of her magical abilities. Her sudden transformation leaves her domed city stranded beneath the waters of the lake, as only she knew the spell. The Krumbic witchcraft proves to be a hybrid of dark arts mixed with magic learned from the Three Adepts at Magic who used to rule the Flatheads, while the three magic spells to operating the city are identified as the parts of her name.

== Queen of the Field Mice ==
The Queen of the Field Mice is a gray mouse who rules the field mice of the Land of Oz. She was first seen in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) being chased by a wildcat until it was slain by the Tin Woodman. After introducing herself to Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, the Queen of the Field Mice called upon her subjects to help get the Cowardly Lion out of the deadly poppy field. Afterwards, the Queen of the Field Mice informs Dorothy of the Golden Cap that can summon and command the winged monkeys.

In &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904), the Queen of the Field Mice sends some of her subjects to help Scarecrow when he is overthrown from his position as the ruler of the Emerald City.

The Queen of the Field Mice appears in the 2017 series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;. She is given the name Marie, and speaks with a French accent.

== Quelala ==
Quelala is a handsome man who Gayelette married in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). He was responsible for creating the Golden Cap that controls the winged monkeys which they used on them after they crashed their wedding day.

Quelala was featured in Roger S. Baum&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;Dorothy of Oz&quot; where he was the boss of the Jester before he became possessed by the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s ghost.

== Quox ==
Quox is a dragon with an electric light attached to his tail who is a descendant of the Original Dragon and first appeared in &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914).

When Quox called the Original Dragon senile, Tititi-Hoochoo used him as an instrument against the Nome King where he strapped some seats to Quox and him carry Betsy Bobbin, Private Jo Files, Hank the Mule, Polychrome, Shaggy Man, Tik-Tok, Queen Ann Soforth, and her army through a Hollow Tube that goes from Tititi-Hoochoo&#x27;s fairyland to the Nome Kingdom. Using the Enchanted Ribbon around his neck, Quox made the Nome King forget his magic and deposed him by using eggs. After the mission was over, Quox returned to his land through the Hollow Tube.

== Rak ==
The Rak is a flying creature from the pages of &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914). The Rak is described as a large winged creature with glowing red eyes that can fly in the air, run like a deer, and swim like a fish. Inside its body is a glowing furnace of fire which allows the creature to breathe out smoke. Its smoky breath blankets the surrounding area like a thick, black fog with an aroma of salt and pepper. It is bigger than a hundred men and feeds on any living thing. Like most other animals in the land of Oz, the Rak can speak. The Rak&#x27;s vague descriptions given in the storybook lead one to believe that the Rak is a type of dragon.

In &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;, the Rak is briefly encountered by Queen Ann Soforth and her army and wounded by gunfire. Although its jaw, wing and leg are broken by the attack, the Rak does not die, as everything in the land of Oz lives an enchanted life and cannot die.

The Rak appears in the 2017 series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;.

== Sawhorse ==
The Sawhorse, spelled &quot;saw-horse&quot; in some of the books, is a character from L. Frank Baum&#x27;s Oz books series. He first appears in &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904). The Sawhorse is a wooden carpenter&#x27;s sawhorse brought to life with the Powder of Life by Tip to carry Jack Pumpkinhead (whose wooden joints were wearing out from walking). He is a log with a notch cut in one end for a mouth, two knots for eyes and a branch for a tail. When he was first made he had no ears and could not follow directions, so Tip corrected that by carving him some ears from tree bark. He also had a post installed on his back so Jack could hold on while riding. His friends deride him as the least intelligent member of their party, though he usually has intelligent things to say when he speaks.

The sawhorse is one of the fastest creatures in Oz because he never gets tired. He carries Glinda in her pursuit of Mombi into the Deadly Desert while the latter is in the form of a gryphon. Princess Ozma has his legs shod with plates of gold to keep his legs from wearing out.

In &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, Baum emphasizes the awkwardness with which the sawhorse walks, tottering one way and then the other because his legs do not bend, and front and hind move together. In &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907), he is described as walking as well as a real horse. However, he approaches the Giant with the Hammer too quickly and sends his rider Omby Amby up to the giant&#x27;s arm. This knocks off his ears and leaves him deaf until they can be replaced. He is integral in defeating the Nome King, kicking him with his hind legs in order to protect Dorothy Gale.

== Scarecrow ==

The Scarecrow first appears in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900), when he joins Dorothy to go to the Wizard in search of brains. When the Wizard leaves Oz, he makes the Scarecrow ruler, a position he holds until the middle of the second book. Later, he moves to a corn-shaped house in the Winkie Country. The Scarecrow appears in many of the later books, including &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot; (1915) and Ruth Plumly Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Book of Oz&quot; (1921), in which he researches his ancestry. He was played by Ray Bolger in the 1939 movie. That actor also played the Scarecrow&#x27;s Kansan counterpart, Hunk, who was one of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry&#x27;s three farmworkers.

== Scraps the Patchwork Girl ==

The Patchwork Girl, aka Scraps, appears in several Oz books beginning with &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913). She is a life-size doll made out of various patches like those on a patchwork quilt. The book revolves around her being created by Margolotte and brought to life by the magic substance called the Powder of Life, that was created by Margolotte&#x27;s husband Dr. Pipt. She was filled with a mixture of character traits. Originally intended to be an unquestioning humble slave, she comes to life as a rather zany acrobatic person with a tendency to break into spontaneous poetry, all thanks to Ojo the Unlucky messing with the formula for her &quot;brain furniture&quot; and joining the adventure to find an antidote for petrification. In later books, she is often paired with the Scarecrow, being his main love interest.

== Shaggy Man ==

The Shaggy Man is a kind old wanderer who is dressed in rags. He has a chivalrous instinct to protect children from monsters. He first appears in &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; (1909) as Dorothy&#x27;s protector, and plays major roles in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913) and &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914). He is similar to Captain Bill Weedles, another &quot;fatherly protector&quot; character.

Ruth Plumly Thompson and John R. Neill largely ignored the Shaggy Man and Captain Bill, giving the &quot;fatherly protector&quot; role to new characters, including Sir Hokus of Pokes and Captain Salt. Jack Snow restored the Shaggy Man&#x27;s place and gave him a lead role in &quot;The Shaggy Man of Oz&quot; in 1949.

== Shaggy Man&#x27;s brother ==
The Shaggy Man has an unnamed brother who is simply dubbed Shaggy Man&#x27;s Brother. His name is given in the 1913 play &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot; as Wiggy. He was a gold miner in Colorado until he ended up in the Nome Kingdom and was taken prisoner by the Nome King who imprisoned him in the Metal Forest. After finding out about his brother&#x27;s plight 10 years later, Shaggy Man led some of his friends to the Nome Kingdom to rescue him. Afterwards, Princess Ozma allowed him to live in the Land of Oz. He appears to be less adventurous than his brother, as his subsequent appearances are limited to cameos in crowd scenes.

== Smith and Tinker ==

Smith and Tinker, introduced in &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907), are an inventor and an artist who worked out of a shop in the Land of Ev. They created the clockwork man Tik-Tok and sold him to Evoldo. They also created the Giant with the Hammer.

Smith, the artist of the duo, painted a picture of a river that was so real that he fell in and drowned.

Tinker, the inventor of the duo, made a ladder so tall that it reached to the Moon. He climbed the ladder to the Moon and once there pulled it up so no one could follow him.

Smith and Tinker appear in the 2017 series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, voiced by JP Karliak and Bill Fagerbakke. These versions are depicted as Munchkin inventors.

== Soldier with the Green Whiskers ==

The Soldier with the Green Whiskers is Oz&#x27;s one-man army. He appears in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) and many of the sequel books. He is portrayed as having a very long green beard and carrying an unloaded rifle. He is alternately referred to as Omby Amby or Wantowin Battles.

== Tik-Tok ==

Tik-Tok is a character who appeared in several Oz books, beginning with &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (1907). He is a machine man controlled by clockwork, which needs to be wound regularly. Tik-Tok is often considered the first robot to appear in literature. He also appeared in the film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, which starred Fairuza Balk as Dorothy Gale, in which he is a main character.

== Tin Woodman ==

The Tin Woodman first appears in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900), joining Dorothy&#x27;s quest to see the Wizard in order to get a heart. He had originally been a human by the name of Nick Chopper, but gradually his human parts had been replaced with metal ones. After the Wicked Witch of the West is defeated, he becomes Emperor of the Winkies. He appears in many later Oz books, often alongside his friend the Scarecrow. In the eponymous &quot;Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; (1918) he searches for his lost love.

== Tititi-Hoochoo ==
Tititi-Hoochoo, the Great Jinjin and Private Citizen, is a Peculiar Person, who rules an unnamed opposite land on the exact opposite side of the earth from the Land of Oz. He appears in &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot; (1914). Like the other people of that land, all his limbs are of a different color than the others, although he has no heart. The two places are connected by the Forbidden Tube, which was created by Hiergargo the Magician who wanted to save travel time between the two places and whose rash use of the tube destroyed him.

== Tommy Kwikstep ==
Tommy Kwikstep is a Munchkin who first appears in &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; (1918).

When running an errand for a witch in exchange for a wish, Tommy got exhausted and without thinking wished that he had 20 legs where he was transformed into a Munchkin with 20 legs. To accommodate his transformed state, Tommy lived in a log with two entrances for him to go in and out of. As the additional legs did make him faster, Tommy has searched all of the Land of Oz for the witch in question while getting corns on his feet. He was restored to normal by Polychrome who also heals his feet of the corns. Tommy vows not to speak without carefully considering what will be said again.

Tommy Kwikstep appears in the 1985 film &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. This version is depicted with six legs. He is seen in the background at the coronation of Princess Ozma.

Tommy Kwikstep appears in the 1996 series &quot;The Oz Kids&quot; episode &quot;Christmas in Oz.&quot;

== Toto ==

Toto is Dorothy&#x27;s pet dog, and he appears in most of the same books as Dorothy, beginning with &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). Due to his appearance in the 1939 film, he has often been ranked near the top of lists of on-screen canine characters.

== Trot ==
Mayre &quot;Trot&quot; Griffiths is a young girl who comes to Oz in &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot; (1915), along with her friend Cap&#x27;n Bill, and becomes a friend and companion of Dorothy, Ozma and Betsy. She is also the protagonist of &quot;The Sea Fairies&quot; and &quot;Sky Island&quot;. She appears in the second season of the 2017 series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, voiced by Kari Wahlgren.

== Ugu the Shoemaker ==
Ugu the Shoemaker is the villain of &quot;The Lost Princess of Oz&quot; (1917). He is morally ambiguous rather than pure evil; Baum states that Ugu &quot;did not know he was wicked&quot;. He was once a shoemaker in Herku, located in the Winkie Country, until he discovered the magic recipes of his ancestors. Thereupon, he decided to become a powerful sorcerer and take possession of the Land of Oz as its ruler. He moved away from Herku and built a Wicker Castle in the west of the Winkie Country. After stealing the Magic Dishpan from Cayke, he used it to steal Glinda the Good Witch&#x27;s Magic Book of Records, the Wizard&#x27;s Black Bag of Magic and, ultimately, he kidnapped Princess Ozma in the process and hid her in the form of an Enchanted Peach Pit. He was finally defeated by Dorothy Gale, who used the Nome King&#x27;s Magic Belt to transform him into a dove. Realizing how much damage he had done, he only asked to remain a peaceful dove and apologize to Dorothy.

== Unc Nunkie ==
Unc Nunkie first appeared in &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913). Unc Nunkie is an elderly Munchkin who lived with his nephew Ojo the Lucky in the forests in Munchkin Country. Unc Nunkie was known for speaking primarily in one-word, monosyllabic sentences, though he very occasionally made a &quot;long&quot; speech using two words. Locals attributed his laconic nature to concealment of royal blood.

Unc Nunkie was accidentally turned to stone by Dr. Pipt&#x27;s Liquid of Petrification, resulting in his nephew Ojo going on a quest to find the ingredients needed for the antidote. Ruth Plumly Thompson explored the &quot;royal blood&quot; thread in &quot;Ojo in Oz&quot; (1933).

== Wicked Witch of the East ==

The Wicked Witch of the East is a character who is crushed by Dorothy&#x27;s house in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). Prior to this, she ruled over the Munchkins and had possession of the magical Silver Shoes (Ruby Slippers in the 1939 musical) that made it possible for her to conquer the Munchkin Country in the undiscovered Land of Oz.

She appears in the book &quot;Wicked&quot; under the name Nessarose by Gregory Maguire.

== Wicked Witch of the South ==
The Wicked Witch of the South is a wicked witch that ruled over Quadling Country. She was mentioned in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; (1908) to have been overthrown by Glinda.

Rachel Cosgrove Payes&#x27; novel &quot;The Wicked Witch of Oz&quot; (1993) features a variation of the character named Singra.

== Wicked Witch of the West ==
The Wicked Witch of the West originated as the primary villain and main antagonist of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900), in which she is given no name. She is described as being completely blind in one eye, and there is no mention of her having green skin. She rules the western quadrant called Winkie Country in the Land of Oz and enslaved many of the natives. She also owns a pack of killer wolves, black crows and stinging bees. When Dorothy Gale and company are sent by the Wizard to defeat her, she sends her collection of deadly pets to kill them but is unsuccessful. She then uses the Golden Cap to call upon the Winged Monkeys who destroy the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, but capture Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion. She imprisons them in her castle before Dorothy melts her with a bucket of water when the Wicked Witch tried to steal one of her Silver Shoes. After her death in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Wicked Witch of the West is rarely referred to again in the later Oz books.

She is known as Evillene in the 1975 Broadway musical &quot;The Wiz&quot;, originated by Mabel King, and reprised in the 1978 film adaptation of the same name. Of all stage, film and animated productions of the Oz story, &quot;The Wiz&quot; follows Baum&#x27;s book the most closely, and therefore she has no green skin.

Under the name Elphaba, she is the protagonist of the 1995 Gregory Maguire novel and the 2003 musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, and is born green due to an elixir given by her father (the Wizard of Oz) to her mother (the wife of the governor of Munchkinland) during their adulterous affair. Discovering that she has real powers, the Wizard of Oz orders her arrest when she refuses to aid him in his terroristic control of Oz, and she is declared a wicked witch by the Wizard&#x27;s press secretary, Madame Morrible. Believing that the governor of Munchkinland is her real father, she is devastated when Glinda gives Dorothy the slippers of her sister Nessarose which had been given her by the governor and which she herself had cast a spell on to enable the disabled Nessarose to walk. Desperate to get these precious family heirlooms back from Dorothy, they confront one another at the castle of Prince Fiyero, Elphaba&#x27;s love interest, but is doused by the girl with a bucket of water. This kills her in the Maguire novel. It merely burns her in the musical – and she uses her feigned death as a way to escape with Fiyero, whom she had turned into the Scarecrow to prevent him from being tortured by the Wizard&#x27;s soldiers.

== Wise Donkey ==
The Wise Donkey is a character from &quot;A New Wonderland&quot; (&quot;The Magical Monarch of Mo&quot;) (1899/1903) and &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913). He began life as an ordinary donkey in Phunniland (Mo, a land even stranger and less logical than Oz), but after consuming numerous books, he learned their contents and became a wise advisor to the King. He sometimes acts in his own interests, at least to the extent of making sure his are met when he aids others, such as suggesting an apple for rescuing Nuphsed, which doesn&#x27;t work, but when he is fed the apple, he gives an answer that does.

Somehow, he was able to cross the Deadly Desert that surrounds Oz and he took up residence with the Foolish Owl who originally resided in Munchkin Country. The Wise Donkey states that he was visiting on the day Oz was cut off from the rest of the world and was unable to return home. He is seen dusting his house when he is visited by Ojo, Scraps, and Bungle. The Wize Donkey believes that someone as wise as he is should find the Foolish Owl unique and amusing. His logic is regarded by Scraps as so askew that she tells Diksey Horner that he sounds like the Wise Donkey.

== Wizard of Oz ==

The Wizard of Oz is the title character of the first book. In that book, the characters journey to him for assistance with their problems. It is later revealed that he is a &quot;Humbug&quot; circus performer named Oscar Diggs from Omaha, Nebraska; and that he had usurped Ozma&#x27;s throne with the assistance of Mombi (though this was later proven false). The Wizard later returns to Oz in the fourth book to permanently live there and later learns real magic from Glinda. The wizard is also shown to own &quot;The Nine Tiny Piglets&quot; which he uses for a trick among other things.

His Kansas counterpart in the 1939 musical film is the travelling magician/fortune teller Professor Marvel; however, the character does not appear in the books as Oz is explicitly a real place, rather than implied to have been a dream.

== Woggle-Bug ==

According to &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; (1904), the Woggle-Bug was once a regular tiny woggle-bug, about the size of a pea. He lived the life of a normal insect until he crawled into a country schoolhouse (presumably somewhere in the Winkie Country of the Land of Oz) and listened to the lessons and lectures the famous Professor Nowitall gave his pupils for about three years. One day, the teacher found and caught him, and decided to use him for an impromptu lesson on woggle-bugs. Nowitall put the bug under a microscope and projected his highly magnified image onto a screen with advanced technology. The bug was proud of his new size; he bowed to the students, and one unnamed little girl standing on the windowsill was startled and fell backward out of the window. While everyone rushed outside to see if she was all right, the Woggle-bug secretly jumped off the screen and ran away. He has remained magnified ever since.

He goes by the name H. M. Woggle-Bug, T.E. (Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated). In later books, the hyphen was sometimes dropped: &quot;Wogglebug&quot;.

In illustrations, he is often depicted wearing bright colors and several pairs of glasses on his elongated proboscis.

== Woozy ==
The Woozy is a four-legged fictional creature from the pages of &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot; (1913). It is described as being dark blue in color and made up of all squares, flat surfaces and edges. Its head is an exact cube and its body is in the shape of a box twice as long as it is wide and high. All four of the Woozy&#x27;s legs are four-sided, as is its stubby tail. The Woozy hears via two openings in the upper corners of its head, has a flat nose and a mouth formed by an opening on the lower edge of its head. When the Woozy gets angry, it has the ability to flash fire with its eyes. The Woozy lives in the Munchkin country in Oz and survives primarily on a diet of honey bees. The Munchkin farmers who raise the honey bees nearby drive the Woozy into the forest and confine it with a fence. Since the Woozy cannot climb, he cannot escape his prison. The Woozy does mention in the text that he can jump very high, but also mentions that he has a ferocious roar, which turns out to be completely untrue.

The creature is entirely hairless except for three stiff, stubby hairs on the end of its tail. Those three hairs were one of five required ingredients for the antidote to the Liquid of Petrification that Ojo, Scraps the Patchwork Girl, and Bungle set out to retrieve in the story. In return for some scraps of bread and cheese that Ojo feeds him, the Woozy agrees to give his hairs to the party. When it becomes clear that the hairs cannot be removed from his tail, Ojo frees the Woozy and allows the creature to accompany the group.

The Woozy appears in the 2017 series &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz&quot; voiced by JP Karliak. In this show, the Woozy is a large furry creature. He only shoots beams from his eyes when he hears whispers which he hates.

== Zeb Hugson ==
Zebediah Hugson is a boy who is a distant cousin of Dorothy Gale, apparently related through Dorothy&#x27;s Aunt Em. He works for his uncle, Bill Hugson, at Hugson&#x27;s Ranch in California, where he also lives. Zeb appears in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; (1908).

Zeb first meets Dorothy at Hugson&#x27;s Siding, when he picks her up in a carriage pulled by Jim the Cab-horse. On their way to the Hugson&#x27;s Ranch, an earthquake causes everyone to fall into the earth and into the Land of the Mangaboos. Zeb, Dorothy, Jim, and Dorothy&#x27;s kitten Eureka are soon joined by Oscar Diggs aka the Wizard of Oz. The travelers undertake a subterranean journey through the Valley of Voe, are briefly imprisoned in the Land of Naught, and encounter a cavern full of Dragonettes. Despite his reservations about being in a strange land, Zeb courageously defends his friends and helps them escape from the Land of Gargoyles by obtaining pairs of gargoyle wings.

After Ozma uses the Magic Belt to bring them to the Land of Oz, Zeb is welcomed as an honoured guest in the Emerald City. During the festivities held to celebrate the arrival of Dorothy and her friends, Zeb participates in a wrestling match with a Munchkin boy, which he loses, and then a boxing match, which Zeb wins. He later serves as one of the nine members of the jury during the trial of Eureka. While the Wizard accepts Ozma&#x27;s invitation to remain in Oz, Dorothy, Zeb, and their animals decide to return home. Though Zeb remarks that Oz is a nice country, he admits that he and Jim feel out of place in a fairy country and wishes to return to Hugson&#x27;s Ranch with Jim. Zeb&#x27;s last evening in Oz is described as being so wonderful, he never forgot it as long as he lived.

In the 1996 series &quot;The Oz Kids&quot;, he somehow came back to Oz and married Dorothy. The couple had two children named Dot and Neddie Hugson.

Johnny has a tool chest from which he can pull out nearly any equipment he needs.

They agree with the Crab with his claim and the Zebra was shamed that he was wrong.

<doc id="577562" wikidata="Q954443" url="?curid=577562" title="Western betrayal">
<text>Western betrayal is the view that the United Kingdom, France and the United States failed to meet their legal, diplomatic, military and moral obligations to the Czechoslovakians and Poles before, during and after World War II. It also sometimes refers to the treatment of other Central and Eastern European states by those three nations.

The concept primarily derives from several events, including British and French appeasement towards Nazi Germany during its 1938 occupation of Czechoslovakia and the perceived failure of Britain and France to adequately assist the Poles during the German invasion of Poland in 1939. It also derives from concessions made by American and British political leaders to the Soviet Union during the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences and their limited response during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising along with post-war events, which allocated Poland to the Soviet sphere of influence as part of the Eastern Bloc.

Historically, such views were intertwined with some of the most significant geopolitical events of the 20th century, including the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, the emergency of the Soviet Union as a dominant superpower exerting control over large parts of Europe after World War II, and various treaties, alliances, and positions during the Cold War. The view of the &quot;Western betrayal&quot; has been criticized as political scapegoating by Central and Eastern Europeans.

==Perception of betrayal==

According to professors Charlotte Bretherton and John Vogler, Western betrayal is a reference to a sense of historical and moral responsibility for the West&#x27;s abandonment of Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War. In Central and Eastern Europe, the interpretation of the outcomes of the Munich Crisis of 1938 and the Yalta Conference of 1945 as a betrayal of Central and Eastern Europe by Western powers has been used by Central and Eastern European leaders to put pressure on Western countries to acquiesce to more recent political requests such as membership in NATO and EU.

In a few cases deliberate duplicity is alleged, whereby secret agreements or intentions are claimed to have existed in conflict with understandings given publicly. An example is British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s covert concordance with the Soviet Union, in which he stated that the Atlantic Charter did not apply to the Baltic states. Given the strategic requirements of winning the war, retired American diplomat Charles G. Stefan argued Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had no option but to accept the demands of their erstwhile ally, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences.

There was also a lack of military or political support for the anticommunist rebels during the uprising in German Democratic Republic in 1953, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and during the democracy-oriented reforms in Czechoslovakia in 1968 (the so-called &quot;Prague Spring&quot;). According to Ilya Prizel, the &quot;preoccupation with their historical sense of &#x27;damaged self&#x27; fueled resentment&quot; towards the West generally and reinforced the western betrayal concept in particular. Grigory Yavlinsky argues that damage to central European national psyches left by the Western &quot;betrayal&quot; at Yalta and Munich remained a &quot;psychological event&quot; or &quot;psychiatric issue&quot; during debates over NATO expansion.

===Criticism of the concept===

Colin Powell stated that he did not think &quot;betrayal is the appropriate word&quot; regarding the Allies&#x27; role in the Warsaw Uprising. While complaints of &quot;betrayal&quot; are common in politics generally, the idea of a western betrayal can also be seen as a political scapegoat in both Central and Eastern Europe and a partisan electioneering phrase among the former Western Allies. Historian Athan Theoharis maintains betrayal myths were used in part by those opposing US membership in the United Nations. The word &quot;Yalta&quot; came to stand for the appeasement of world communism and abandonment of freedom.

==Czechoslovakia==
===Munich Conference===
The term &quot;Betrayal of the West&quot; (, ) was coined after the 1938 Munich Conference when Czechoslovakia was forced to cede the mostly German-populated Sudetenland to Germany. The region contained the Czechoslovak border fortifications and means of viable defence against German invasion. Poland would take Trans-Olza from Czechoslovakia, while the First Vienna Award returned territories to Hungary. The next year, by the proclamation of the Slovak State, Czechoslovakia was dissolved, the next day the remainder of Carpathian Ruthenia was occupied and annexed by Hungary, while the next day Germany occupied the remaining Czech lands and proclaimed the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

Along with Italy and Nazi Germany, the Munich treaty was signed by Britain and France, both allied ot Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia was allied by treaty with France so it would be obliged to help Czechoslovakia if it was attacked. Czech politicians joined the newspapers in regularly using the term &quot;Western betrayal&quot; and it, along with the associated feelings, became a stereotype among Czechs. The Czech terms &quot;Mnichov&quot; (Munich), &quot;Mnichovská zrada&quot; (&quot;Munich betrayal&quot;), &quot;Mnichovský diktát&quot; (&quot;Munich Dictate&quot;), and &quot;zrada spojenců&quot; (&quot;betrayal of the allies&quot;) were coined at the same time and have the same meaning. Poet František Halas published a poem with verse about &quot;ringing bell of betrayal&quot;.

Then Member of Parliament for Epping, Winston Churchill said: &quot;Britain and France had to choose between war and dishonour. They chose dishonour. They will have war&quot;.

===Prague uprising===
On 5 May 1945, the citizens of Prague learned of the American invasion of Czechoslovakia by the US Third Army and revolted against German occupation. In four days of street fighting, thousands of Czechs were killed. Tactical conditions were favourable for an American advance, and General Patton, in command of the army, requested permission to continue eastward to the Vltava river in order to aid the Czech partisans fighting in Prague. This was denied by General Eisenhower, who was disinclined to accept American casualties or risk antagonising the Soviet Union. As a result, Prague was liberated on 9 May by the Red Army, significantly increasing the standing of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. According to a British diplomat, this was the moment that &quot;Czechoslovakia was now definitely lost to the West.&quot;

==Poland==

===World War I aftermath===

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, a complex set of alliances was established among the nations of Europe, in the hope of preventing future wars (either with Germany or the Soviet Union). With the rise of Nazism in Germany, this system of alliances was strengthened by the signing of a series of &quot;mutual assistance&quot; alliances between France, Britain, and Poland (Franco-Polish alliance). This agreement with France stated that in the event of war the other allies were to fully mobilise and carry out a &quot;ground intervention within two weeks&quot; in support of the ally being attacked. The Anglo-Polish alliance stated that in the event of hostilities with a European power, the other contracting party would give &quot;all the support and assistance in its power.&quot;

According to Krzysztof Źwikliński, additionally representatives of the Western powers made several military promises to Poland, including designs as those made by British General William Edmund Ironside in his July 1939 talks with Marshall Rydz-Śmigły who promised an attack from the direction of Black Sea, or placing a British aircraft carrier in the Baltic. However, the Anglo-Polish alliance did not make that commitment, and the British commitment to France was for four divisions in Europe within 30 days of the outbreak of war, which was met.

===Beginning of World War II, 1939===

On the eve of the Second World War, the Polish government tried to buy as much armaments as it could and was asking for arms loans from Britain and France. As a result of that in the summer of 1939 Poland placed orders for 160 French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters, and for 111 British airplanes (100 light bombers Fairey Battle, 10 Hurricanes, and 1 Spitfire). Although some of these planes had been shipped to Poland before 1 September 1939, none took part in combat. Shipments were interrupted due to the outbreak of war. The total amount of the loan from British government was also much smaller than asked for. Britain agreed to lend 8 million pounds, but Poland was asking for 60 million.

Upon the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, after giving Germany an ultimatum on 1 September, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September, and a British naval blockade of Germany was initiated. General Gort was appointed commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and placed under the command of French General Gamelin of the North-eastern Theatre of Operations, as agreed before the war. On 4 September, an RAF raid against German warships in harbour was conducted, and the BEF began its shipment to France.

The German forces reached Warsaw on 8 September, and on 14 September, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły ordered Polish forces to withdraw to the Romanian Bridgehead. On 17 September, the Soviet Union invaded Poland, and Polish Army in the field was effectively defeated before the divisions of the BEF could arrive in France. The first two BEF divisions, which took their place in the French line and change of command, on 3 October, and two further BEF divisions took their place in the French line on 12 October.

France had committed to undertaking a ground offensive within two weeks of the outbreak of war. The French initiated full mobilisation and began the limited Saar Offensive on 7 September, sending 40 divisions into the region. The French assault was slowed down by out-dated doctrines, minefields, and the French lacked mine detectors. When the French reached artillery range of the Siegfried Line, they found that their shells could not penetrate the German defences. The French decided to regroup an attack on 20 September, but when Poland was invaded by the Soviet Union on 17 September, any further assault was called off. Around 13 September, the Polish military envoy to France, general Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki, upon receiving the text of the message sent by Gamelin, alerted Marshal Śmigły: &quot;I received the message by General Gamelin. Please don&#x27;t believe a single word in the dispatch&quot;.

It had been decided that no major air operations against Germany would take place. This was due to French concerns over reprisals on RAF launches from French airfields, against targets in Germany, so most British bomber activity over Germany was the dropping of propaganda leaflets and reconnaissance. This theme would continue in subsequent Anglo-French Supreme War Council meetings. Afterwards, French military leader Maurice Gamelin issued orders prohibiting Polish military envoys Lieutenant Wojciech Fyda and General Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki from contacting him. In his post-war diaries, General Edmund Ironside, the chief of the Imperial General Staff, commented on French promises: &quot;The French had lied to the Poles in saying they are going to attack. There is no idea of it&quot;.

On 17 September 1939 the Soviet Union invaded Poland, as agreed in advance with Germany following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Britain and France did not take any significant action in response to the Soviet invasion. However, the terms of the Anglo-Polish alliance specifically applied to invasion from Germany only.

France and Britain were unable to launch a successful land attack on Germany in September 1939, and Poland was overcome by both the Germans and Soviets on 6 October, with the last Polish units capitulating that day following the battle of Kock. However, even by the end of October, the still-forming British Expeditionary Force totaled only 4 divisions compared to the 25 German divisions in Western Germany, making a British invasion of Germany unlikely to succeed.

===Tehran, 1943===

In November 1943, the Big Three (the USSR, US, and UK) met at the Tehran Conference. President Roosevelt and PM Churchill officially agreed that the eastern borders of Poland would roughly follow the Curzon Line. The Polish government-in-exile was not a party to this decision made in secret. The resulting loss of the Kresy, or &quot;eastern territories&quot;, approximately 48% of Poland&#x27;s pre-war territory, to the Soviet Union was seen by the London Poles in exile as another &quot;betrayal&quot; by their Western &quot;Allies&quot;. However, it was no secret to the Allies that before his death in July 1943 General Władysław Sikorski, Prime Minister of Poland&#x27;s London-based government in exile had been the originator, and not Stalin, of the concept of a westward shift of Poland&#x27;s boundaries along an Oder–Neisse line as compensation for relinquishing Poland&#x27;s eastern territories as part of a Polish rapprochement with the USSR. Józef Retinger, who was Sikorski&#x27;s special political advisor at the time, was also in agreement with Sikorski&#x27;s concept of Poland&#x27;s realigned post-war borders, later in his memoirs Retinger wrote: &quot;At the Tehran Conference, in November 1943, the Big Three agreed that Poland should receive territorial compensation in the West, at Germany&#x27;s expense, for the land it was to lose to Russia in Central and Eastern Europe. This seemed like a fair bargain.&quot;

Churchill told Stalin he could settle the issue with the Poles once a decision was made in Tehran, however he never consulted the Polish leadership. When the Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile Stanisław Mikołajczyk attended the Moscow Conference (1944), he was convinced he was coming to discuss borders that were still disputed, while Stalin believed everything had already been settled. This was the principal reason for the failure of the Polish Prime Minister&#x27;s mission to Moscow. The Polish premier allegedly begged for inclusion of Lwów and Wilno in the new Polish borders, but got the following reply from Vyacheslav Molotov: &quot;There is no use discussing that; it was all settled in Tehran.&quot;

===Warsaw Uprising, 1944===
Since the establishment of the Polish government-in-exile in Paris and then in London, the military commanders of the Polish army were focusing most of their efforts on preparation of a future all-national uprising against Germany. Finally the plans for Operation Tempest were prepared and on 1 August 1944, the Warsaw Uprising started. The Uprising was an armed struggle by the Polish Home Army to liberate Warsaw from German occupation and Nazi rule.

Despite the fact that Polish and later Royal Air Force (RAF) planes flew missions over Warsaw dropping supplies from 4 August on, the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) planes did not join the operation. The Allies specifically requested the use of Red Army airfields near Warsaw on 20 August but were refused by Stalin on 22 August (he referred to the insurrectionists as &quot;a handful of criminals&quot;). After Stalin&#x27;s objections to support for the uprising, Churchill telegraphed Roosevelt on 25 August and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin and to &quot;see what happens&quot;. Roosevelt replied on 26 August that &quot;I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you in the proposed message to Uncle Joe.&quot; The commander of the British air drop, Air Marshal Sir John Slessor, later stated, &quot;How, after the fall of Warsaw, any responsible statesman could trust the Russian Communist further than he could kick him, passes the comprehension of ordinary men.&quot;

===Yalta, 1945===

The Yalta Conference (4-11 February 1945) acknowledged the era of Soviet domination of Central and Eastern Europe, subsequent to the Soviet occupation of these lands as they advanced against Nazi Germany. This domination lasted until the end of Communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe in late 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 and left bitter memories of Western betrayal and Soviet dominance in the collective memory of the region. To many Polish Americans, the Yalta conference &quot;constituted a betrayal&quot; of Poland and the Atlantic Charter. &quot;After World War II,&quot; remarked Strobe Talbott, &quot;many countries in the (center and) east suffered half a century under the shadow of Yalta.&quot; Territories which the Soviet Union had occupied during World War II in 1939 (with the exception of the Białystok area) were permanently annexed, and most of their Polish inhabitants expelled: today these territories are part of Belarus, Ukraine, and Lithuania. The factual basis of this decision was the result of a forged referendum from November 1939 in which the &quot;huge majority&quot; of voters accepted the incorporation of these lands into western Belarus and western Ukraine. In compensation, Poland was given former German territory (the so-called Recovered Territories): the southern half of East Prussia and all of Pomerania and Silesia, up to the Oder–Neisse line. The German population of these territories was expelled in masses and these territories were subsequently repopulated with Poles including Poles expelled from the Kresy regions. This, along with other similar migrations in Central and Eastern Europe, combined to form one of the largest human migrations in modern times. Stalin ordered Polish resistance fighters to be either incarcerated or deported to gulags in Siberia.

At the time of Yalta over 200,000 troops of the Polish Armed Forces in the West were serving under the high command of the British Army. Many of these men and women were originally from the Kresy region of eastern Poland including cities such as Lwów and Wilno. They had been deported from Kresy to the Soviet gulags when Hitler and Stalin occupied Poland in 1939 in accordance with the Nazi–Soviet Pact. Two years later, when Churchill and Stalin formed an alliance against Hitler, the Kresy Poles were released from the Gulags in Siberia, formed the Anders Army, and marched to Iran to create the II Corps (Poland) under British high command. These Polish troops contributed to the Allied defeat of the Germans in North Africa and Italy, and hoped to return to Kresy in an independent and democratic Poland at the end of the War. But at Yalta, the borders agreed in Tehran in 1943 were finalized meaning that Stalin would keep the Soviet gains Hitler agreed to in the Nazi–Soviet Pact, including Kresy, and carry out Polish population transfers. These transfers included the land Poland gained at Tehran in the West, at the expense of Germany. Consequently, at Yalta, it was agreed that tens of thousands of veteran Polish troops under British command should lose their Kresy homes to the Soviet Union. In reaction, thirty officers and men from the II Corps committed suicide.

Churchill defended his actions in a three-day Parliamentary debate starting 27 February 1945, which ended in a vote of confidence. During the debate, many MPs openly criticised Churchill and passionately voiced loyalty to Britain&#x27;s Polish allies and expressed deep reservations about Yalta. Moreover, 25 of these MPs risked their careers to draft an amendment protesting against Britain&#x27;s tacit acceptance of Poland&#x27;s domination by the Soviet Union. These members included Arthur Greenwood, Viscount Dunglass, Commander Archibald Southby, the Lord Willoughby de Eresby, and Victor Raikes. After the failure of the amendment, Henry Strauss, the Member of Parliament for Norwich, resigned his seat in protest at the British treatment of Poland.

Before the Second World War ended, the Soviets installed a pro-Soviet regime. Although President Roosevelt &quot;insisted on free and unfettered&quot; elections in Poland, Vyacheslav Molotov instead managed to deliver an election fair by &quot;Soviet standards.&quot; As many as half a million Polish soldiers refused to return to Poland, because of the Soviet repressions of Polish citizens, the Trial of the Sixteen, and other executions of pro-democracy Poles, particularly the so-called cursed soldiers, former members of the Armia Krajowa. The result was the Polish Resettlement Act 1947, Britain&#x27;s first mass immigration law.

Yalta was used by ruling communists to underline anti-Western sentiment in Poland. It was easy to argue that Poland was not very important to the West, since Allied leaders sacrificed Polish borders, legal government, and free elections for future peace between the Allies and the Soviet Union.

On the other hand, some authors have pointed out that Yalta allowed the Polish communists to win over Polish nationalists by allowing them to realize their goal to annex and resettle formerly German land.

The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), formed in 1949, was portrayed by Communist propaganda as the breeder of Hitler&#x27;s posthumous offspring who desired retaliation and wanted to take back from Poland the &quot;Recovered Territories&quot; that had been home of more than 8 million Germans. Giving this picture a grain of credibility was that West Germany until 1970 refused to recognize the Oder-Neisse Line as the German-Polish border, and that some West German officials had a tainted Nazi past. For a segment of Polish public opinion, Communist rule was seen as the lesser of the two evils.

Defenders of the actions taken by the Western allies maintain that &quot;Realpolitik&quot; made it impossible to do anything else, and that they were in no shape to start an utterly un-winnable war with the Soviet Union over the subjugation of Poland and other Central and Eastern European countries immediately after the end of World War II. It could be contended that the presence of a double standard with respect to Nazi and Soviet aggression existed in 1939 and 1940, when the Soviets attacked the eastern part of Poland, then the Baltic States, and then Finland, and yet the Western Allies chose not to intervene in those theatres of the war.

The chief American negotiator at Yalta was Alger Hiss, later accused of being a Soviet spy and convicted of perjuring himself in his testimony to the House Committee on Unamerican Activities. This accusation was later corroborated by the Venona tapes. In 2001, James Barron, a staff reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, identified what he called a &quot;growing consensus that Hiss, indeed, had most likely been a Soviet agent.&quot;

At the war&#x27;s end many of these feelings of resentment were capitalised on by the occupying Soviets, who used them to reinforce anti-Western sentiments within Poland. Propaganda was produced by Communists to show the Soviet Union as the Great Liberator, and the West as the Great Traitor. For instance, Moscow&#x27;s &quot;Pravda&quot; reported in February 1944 that all Poles who valued Poland&#x27;s honour and independence were marching with the &quot;Union of Polish Patriots&quot; in the USSR.

===Aborted Yalta agreement enforcement plans===

At some point in the spring of 1945, Churchill commissioned a contingency military enforcement operation plan (war on the Soviet Union) to obtain a &quot;square deal for Poland&quot; (Operation Unthinkable), which resulted in a May 22 report stating unfavorable success odds. The report&#x27;s arguments included geostrategic issues (possible Soviet-Japanese alliance resulting in moving of Japanese troops from continent to Home Islands, threat to Iran and Iraq) and uncertainties concerning land battles in Europe.

==Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia==

During the Fourth Moscow Conference in 1944, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and British prime minister Winston Churchill discussed how to divide various European countries into spheres of influence. Churchill&#x27;s account of the incident is that Churchill suggested that the Soviet Union should have 90 percent influence in Romania and 75 percent in Bulgaria; the United Kingdom should have 90 percent in Greece; with a 50–50 share in Hungary and Yugoslavia. The two foreign ministers, Anthony Eden and Vyacheslav Molotov, negotiated about the percentage shares on October 10 and 11. The result of these discussions was that the percentages of Soviet influence in Bulgaria and, more significantly, Hungary were amended to 80 percent.

<doc id="577567" wikidata="Q3981034" url="?curid=577567" title="Tarana">
<text>Tarana is a type of composition in Hindustani classical vocal music in which certain words (e.g. &quot;odani&quot;, &quot;todani&quot;, &quot;tadeem&quot; and &quot;yalali&quot;) based on Persian and Arabic phonemes are rendered at a medium (&quot;madhya laya&quot;) or fast (&quot;drut laya&quot;) rate. It was invented by Amir Khusro (1253-1325 CE). In modern times, the singer Amir Khan helped popularize it and researched its origins and the syllables used. Nissar Hussain Khan was a tarana singer. Tarana was also used by Sikh tenth Guru Gobind Singh in his compositions.

==Form==
A second, contrasting melody, usually with higher notes, is introduced once before returning to the main melody. The tarana may include a Persian quatrain, and may use syllables from sitar or tabla such as &quot;dar-dar&quot; or &quot;dir-dir&quot;; singers might recite full compositions (e.g. tihais, gats, tukdas) within the body of the tarana.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Norway on 9 and 10 September 2001. The governing Labour Party lost seats and their vote share was the worst they had ever obtained in a post-war election. Although they still won a plurality of votes and seats, they were unable to form a government. Instead, a centre-right coalition of the Conservative Party, the Christian Democratic Party and Liberal Party was formed, led by Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik of the Christian Democratic Party, with confidence and supply support from the Progress Party.

<doc id="577570" wikidata="Q672227" url="?curid=577570" title="Bloodhound (missile)">
<text>The Bristol Bloodhound is a British ramjet powered surface-to-air missile developed during the 1950s. It served as the UK&#x27;s main air defence weapon into the 1990s and was in large-scale service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the forces of four other countries.

Part of sweeping changes to the UK&#x27;s defence posture, the Bloodhound was intended to protect the RAF&#x27;s V bomber bases to preserve the deterrent force from attacking bombers that made it past the Lightning interceptor force. Bloodhound Mk. I entered service in December 1958, the first British guided weapon to enter full operational service. This was part of Stage 1 upgrades to the defensive systems, in the later Stage 2, both Bloodhound and the fighters would be replaced by a longer-range missile code named Blue Envoy. When this was ultimately cancelled in 1957, parts of its design were worked into Bloodhound Mk. II, roughly doubling the range of the missile. The Mk. I began to be replaced by the Mk. II starting in 1964. Mk. II performance was such that it was also selected as the interceptor missile in the Violet Friend ABM system, although this was ultimately cancelled.

The Bloodhound Mk. II was a relatively advanced missile for its era, roughly comparable to the US&#x27;s Nike Hercules in terms of range and performance, but using an advanced continuous-wave semi-active radar homing system, offering excellent performance against electronic countermeasures and low-altitude targets. It also featured a digital computer for fire control that was also used for readiness checks and various calculations. It was a relatively large missile, which limited it to stationary defensive roles similar to the Hercules or the Soviets&#x27; S-25 Berkut, although Sweden operated its Bloodhounds in a semi-mobile form.

Bloodhound shares much in common with the English Electric Thunderbird, including some of the radar systems and guidance features. Thunderbird was smaller and much more mobile, seeing service with the British Army and several other forces. The two missiles served in tandem for some time, until the shorter-range role of the Thunderbird was replaced by the much smaller and fast-acting BAC Rapier starting in 1971. Bloodhound&#x27;s longer range kept it in service until the threat of bomber attack by the Soviet Union was deemed to have disappeared with the dissolution of the union in 1991. The last Mk. II missile squadron stood down in July 1991, although Swiss examples remained operational until 1999.

==History==
===Early SAM development===
During the late stages of World War II, the British armed forces began the development of surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), or as they became known in the UK, surface-to-air guided weapons (SAGW). The Royal Navy was primarily interested in weapons to counteract &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers dropping glide bombs, which had been used with great effectiveness during the invasion of Italy, and looking toward countering the kamikaze threat in the Pacific. The British Army was interested in a longer-ranged system to supplant or even replace their anti-aircraft artillery. The Royal Air Force was largely uninterested at this point, and put their effort into air-to-air missiles.

From these different needs, two experimental SAGW systems emerged, the Navy&#x27;s Fairey Stooge and Army&#x27;s Brakemine. Stooge was a low-performance system, more of a drone aircraft than a missile, which had to be manually guided in front of approaching aircraft using radio control and then detonated by the operator. This limited it to daytime visual range and good weather, neither of which was satisfying. In contrast to Stooge, Brakemine was a more modern concept. While it offered only marginally better range than Stooge, its beam riding guidance was highly automated and allowed the missile to fly directly at its targets at high speed in any conditions, day or night.

Looking to the future, the Navy saw a need to counter jet-powered aircraft, demanding a much higher-performance system. In 1944, the Navy formed the &quot;Guided Anti-Aircraft Projectile Committee&quot;, or GAP Committee, to consider such a design. The GAP team suggested combining the Navy&#x27;s new Type 909 radar with a new missile to produce a Brakemine-like system but with considerably higher accuracy and much longer range. This was initially known as LOPGAP, for Liquid-Oxygen and Petrol, the proposed fuel.

In January 1947, the new Navy design was given the name Seaslug. Around the same time, an effort was underway to centralise all guided missile development at the Royal Aircraft Establishment&#x27;s (RAE) new Guided Weapons Department. They took over LOPGAP development from the Navy, as well as using up most existing Stooge and Brakemine systems to gain familiarity with the needs of missile testing. They also issued a requirement for the Army and Air Force for a very long-range weapon to protect important installations like airfields and cities. This became the &quot;Red Heathen&quot; concept, with a desired range on the order of .

===Seaslug and Red Heathen===
During a review of the RAE&#x27;s work by the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC) in March 1948, a lack of manpower at the RAE was a serious issue and Seaslug was downgraded in importance in favour of Red Heathen. Around the same time, the Army began to express doubts about the Red Heathen as it became clear that the beam riding guidance systems of the early experimental missiles did not work at long range. They suggested Seaslug might be a good interim development.

After considerable debate, in September 1948 Seaslug was restarted as &quot;insurance&quot; against problems in Red Heathen, and in 1949, moved to &quot;top priority&quot;. A development contract was signed with Armstrong Whitworth lead development, and the Project 502 industry group was organized in 1949 to produce it. The DRPC suggested downgrading Red Heathen to use a missile with performance roughly equal to Seaslug, but replacing its guidance with a semi-active radar homing system which was more suitable for development of a long-range system in the future. English Electric continued development of this &quot;new&quot; Red Heathen. Later, looking for a second approach to the requirement, using a ramjet instead of a rocket motor, the RAE approached de Havilland, but they declined due to workload. The RAE then turned to Bristol Aerospace, signing an agreement late in 1949 for &quot;Red Duster&quot;, which Bristol referred to as &quot;Project 1220&quot;. Armstrong, Bristol and EE were now all working on different approaches to the same basic requirement. Ferranti was brought on to begin development of the new radars and guidance systems.

Before long, the two Red Heathen entries began to diverge, and the two designs were given their own rainbow codes; EE&#x27;s design became &quot;Red Shoes&quot;, and Bristol&#x27;s became &quot;Red Duster&quot;. Bristol&#x27;s efforts were fairly similar to EE&#x27;s in most ways, although it was somewhat less mobile while offering somewhat better range.

===The Stage Plan===
After the end of the Second World War, UK air defences were run down, on the assumption that it would be at least a decade before another war started. However, the Soviet atomic bomb test of 1949 forced a re-evaluation of that policy, and UK defence planners started studying the problems of building a more integrated air defence network than the patchwork of WWII expediencies.

The Cherry Report called for a reorganisation of existing radars under the ROTOR project along with new control centres to better coordinate fighters and anti-aircraft guns. This was strictly a stop-gap measure however; over the longer term there would be a requirement for deployment of new long-range radars in place of the Chain Home systems from the war, construction of command and control sites able to survive a nuclear attack, interceptors of ever-increasing performance, and anti-aircraft missiles and guns to provide a last-ditch defence.

The missile portion was the newest and least understood technology. In order to deploy quickly and gain experience with these systems, the &quot;Stage Plan&quot; was developed. &quot;Stage 1&quot; called for missiles based on a LOPGAP/Seaslug-type missile with a range of only 20 miles with capabilities against subsonic or low-supersonic attacking aircraft, which were assumed to be at medium or high altitudes. The original long-range Red Heathen concept then became Stage 2, aiming to replace the Stage 1 design in the 1960s The Stage 1 missile would be based on LOPGAP.

===Development===
The RAE suggested the use of a ramjet for power as it offered better fuel economy. Bristol had only passing experience with this engine design, so they began a long series of tests to develop it. As the ramjet only operates effectively at high speeds over Mach 1, Bristol built a series of testbed airframes to flight-test the engines. The first, JTV-1, resembled a flying torpedo with the ramjets fitted to the end of the cruciform rear fins. Early problems were ironed out and the JTV series was the first British ramjet powered aircraft to operate continually at supersonic speeds.

Once the JTV testing started to proceed, Bristol studied a series of airframe designs. The first was a long tube with an intake at the front, and four delta-shaped fins arranged near the front of the fuselage. The intake and wings give it some resemblance to the English Electric Lightning, albeit with a long tube sticking out of the aft end. This arrangement left little internal room for fuel or guidance, as the tube ran down the centre of the entire fuselage. A second design was similar, but used mid-mounted fins of reverse-delta shape (flat at the front) with small intakes at their roots. The performance of these intakes was not well understood, and considered risky. The final design was essentially a small aircraft, with mid-set trapezoidal wings and four small swept wing fins at the extreme rear. In this version, two engines were mounted on the wing tips, similar to the mounting used on the JTV series and thus better understood.

One unique feature of the new design was the aerodynamic control system known as &quot;twist and steer&quot;. Typical large missile designs use control surfaces at the tail mounted in-line with symmetric wings mounted near the fuselage midpoint. The control surfaces tilt the missile relative to its direction of travel, causing the wings to become non-symmetrical relative the airflow, generating lift that turns the missile. Bristol was concerned that the angles needed to generate the required lift using this method would be too great for the engines intakes to deal with, so it adopted the twist and steer system, first experimented with on the war-era Brakemine project.

In this system the four cropped-delta surfaces at the tail were fixed and used only for stability, not control. Directional control was provided though two large mid-mounted wings which could be rotated independently to large angles. The guidance system rotated the wings in opposite directions to roll the missile until the wings were perpendicular to the target, and then rotated them in the same direction to provide lift in the required direction. This meant that the wings could be rotated to the angles required to generate large amounts of lift, without rotating the missile body itself. This kept airflow in the direction of the missile body, and thus the engine intakes, as well as greatly reducing the drag caused by the tilting of the fuselage across the relative wind. The long, thin fuselage offered very low rotational inertia, conferring excellent homing performance in the last few seconds. The engines were mounted above and below these wings on short extensions.

In the initial designs, a single very large solid fuel booster launched the missile off its launcher and powered it to speeds where the ramjets could take over.

===Flight testing===

In 1952 the design was accepted by the Combined United Kingdom/Australia Committee for Trials. A prototype of the new layout was built and flown in Wales as the -scale XTV-1, powered by three 5-inch boosters strapped together. This demonstrated that the overall length with the booster attached would be a significant problem in the field.
In response, the original booster was re-designed as a series of four smaller rockets designed to &quot;wrap around&quot; the missile fuselage. This layout was tested on the scale XTV-2, the full-sized but unpowered XTV-3 that tested the new boosters, and finally the full-sized and powered XTV-4. The final modification, first tested on the XTV-3, was to replace the four rear fins with two larger ones, which allowed the four booster motors to be mounted on a common ring, ensuring they separated in different directions. This resulted in the definitive XTV-5.

As the design matured, the engine requirements were finalised. The resulting Bristol Thor was originally designed in conjunction with Boeing, which had extensive experience with the similar engines of the BOMARC missile. Testing of the prototype production versions, known as XRD (eXperimental Red Duster), moved to the Woomera range in South Australia in mid-1953. These proved very disappointing due to ramjet problems, which were traced to the use of a flare as an ignition source inside the engine. This was replaced with an igniter design provided by the National Gas Turbine Establishment and the problems were quickly sorted out. Firings against GAF Jindivik target aircraft started in 1956, and eventually 500 tests of all of the designs were completed before it entered service.

Guidance was semi-automatic, with the targets initially identified by existing early warning radar sites and then handed off to the Bloodhound sites for local detection and attack. This was handled by the truck-mounted Type 83 &quot;Yellow River&quot; pulse radar system that could be fairly easily jammed and was vulnerable to ground &quot;clutter&quot;, thus degrading low-level capability.

By the time Bloodhound was ready for deployment, the solid-fuelled Red Shoes, now known as the English Electric Thunderbird, was proving successful and the British Army dropped its orders for the Bloodhound in favour of the Thunderbird. The Bloodhound Mk 1 entered British service in 1958, and was selected for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in November of that year. Deployment of the Bloodhound Mk. I began in 1958, initially to provide protection for the RAF&#x27;s V bomber bases. Australian deployments started in January 1961.

Although the Bloodhound was successful technically, Government auditors found that Ferranti had made far larger profits than projected from the Bloodhound I contract. Sir John Lang chaired an inquiry into the matter. Ferranti Chairman, Sebastian de Ferranti, agreed to pay back £4.25 million to the government in 1964.

===Mark II===


By 1955 it appeared that the Stage 2 missile, originally known as Green Sparkler but now as Blue Envoy, was too far beyond the state of the art to be able to enter service before the Thunderbird and Bloodhound became obsolete. However, the much improved continuous wave radar systems being developed for the same project were progressing well. In order to address the performance gap due to the delays, interim (or vulgar) Stages were added to the Stage plan. &quot;Stage &quot; combined a slightly upgraded Thunderbird with radar technology from Blue Envoy, while &quot;Stage &quot; would do the same to Bloodhound.

In 1957 the entire Stage concept was abandoned as part of the 1957 Defence White Paper. The Paper argued that the Soviets would move their strategic forces to ballistic missiles and that the likelihood of an air attack solely by bombers would be increasingly unlikely. An attack by bombers would simply signal that missiles were also on their way. In this case, defending the V bombers against air attack did nothing; the only way they could survive would be to launch to holding areas on any suggestion of any sort of attack. In this case, there was no point trying to defend the bomber bases, and Blue Envoy was not needed.

Its cancellation caught Bristol by surprise, and their missile division, Bristol Dynamics, had no other projects to fall back on. Bristol engineers sharing a taxi with their Ferranti counterparts hatched a new plan to adopt the Blue Envoy ramjets and radars to a lengthened Bloodhound, and submitted this for study. The proposal was accepted, producing the Bloodhound Mk. II.

The Mk. II featured a more powerful Thor engine based on changes investigated in Blue Envoy. The increased power allowed the weights to increased, and to take advantage of this the fuselage was stretched to allow more fuel storage. These changes dramatically extended range from about , pushing the practical engagement distance out to about (although detected at a longer range, the missile takes time to travel to its target, during which the target approaches the base).

The Mk. II was guided by either the Ferranti Type 86 &quot;Firelight&quot; radar for mobile use, or the larger fixed-emplacement Marconi Type 87 &quot;Scorpion&quot;. In addition to its own illumination and tracking antennas, the Scorpion also added one of the receiver antennas out of a Bloodhound missile body onto the same antenna framework. This antenna was used to determine what the missile&#x27;s own receiver was seeing, which was used for jamming detection and assessment. The new radars eliminated problems with ground reflections, allowing the missile to be fired at any visible target, no matter how close to the ground. Combined with the new engines, the Mk. II had an extended altitude performance between .

The use of a CW radar presented a problem for the semi-automatic guidance system. Continuous wave radar systems rely on the Doppler effect to detect moving targets, comparing returned signals to the radar signal being broadcast, and looking for any shift in frequency. However, in the Bloodhound&#x27;s case the missile was moving away from the reference signal as fast, or faster, than the target would be approaching it. The missile would need to know the velocity of the target as well as its own airspeed in order to know what frequency to look for. But this information was known only to the radar station on the ground, since the missile did not broadcast any signals of its own.

To solve this problem, the radar site also broadcast an omnidirectional reference signal that was shifted to the frequency that the missile&#x27;s receiver should be looking for, taking into account both the target and missile speed. Thus the missile only had to compare the signal from its nose-mounted receiver with the signal from the launch site, greatly simplifying the electronics.

Many of the calculations of lead, frequency shifting, and pointing angles for the radars were handled by the custom-built Ferranti Argus computer. This machine would later go on to be a successful industrial control computer which was sold all over Europe for a wide variety of roles.

The Mk. II started tests in 1963 and entered RAF service in 1964. Unlike the Mk. I that had limited performance advantages compared to the Thunderbird, the Mk. II was a much more formidable weapon, with capabilities against Mach 2 aircraft at high altitudes. Several new Bloodhound bases were set up for the Mk. II, and some of the Mk. I bases were updated to host the Mk. II.

There was an export version planned, Bloodhound 21, that had less sophisticated electronic countermeasures equipment.

===Further developments===
The planned Mk. III (also known as RO 166) was a nuclear warhead-equipped Mk. II with a longer range – around – achieved with improved ramjet engine and larger boosters. This was also to be the interceptor for the Violet Friend anti-ballistic missile system, which added a radio control link to allow the missile to be guided into the rough interception area while the enemy warhead was still too far away for the Type 86 radar to pick up. The project, one of several adaptations of existing British missiles to carry tactical nuclear devices, was cancelled in 1960.

The Mk. IV was a cancelled mobile version, based on Swedish Army field experience.

==Basic description==

The main missile is a long cylinder of magnesium frames and aluminium alloy skin with a prominent ogive nose cone at the front and some boat-tailing at the rear. Small aluminium-covered wooden cropped-delta wings are mounted midpoint, providing pitch and roll control by pivoting in unison or independently with additional steering provided by differential fuel feed to each of the ram jets. Two smaller rectangular fixed surfaces were mounted in-line with the main wings, almost at the rear of the missile.

The boost engines are held together as a single assembly by a metal ring at the rear of the missile. Each motor has a small hook on the ring as well as similar one at the front holding it to the missile body. After firing, when the thrust of the rockets falls below the thrust of the now-lit ramjets, the boosters slide rearward until the front hook disengages from the missile body. The boosters are then free to rotate around their attachment to the metal ring, and are designed to rotate outward, away from the fuselage. In action, they fold open like the petals on a flower, greatly increasing drag and pulling the entire four-booster assembly away from the missile body.

Small inlets on the roots of the stub wings holding the engines allow air into the missile body for two tasks. Two ram air turbines driving turbopumps generate hydraulic power for the wing control system, and a fuel pump that feeds the engines. Smaller inlet tubes provide ram air to pressurise the fuel tanks. Kerosene fuel is held in two large rubber bag tanks in bays either side of the wing bay where the wings are attached. Electrical power was provided by a molten salt battery. At room temperature, this would be inert and suitable for long-term storage without degradation, but was heated to its working temperature by a pyrotechnic heat source ignited at launch.

Although in tests the Bloodhound had executed direct hits on target bombers flying at , Mark II production models, in common with many air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles of that period and after, had a proximity fuzed continuous rod warhead (known as the K11A1) designed to destroy attacking aircraft without requiring a direct hit.

The acceleration of the Mk. II can be gauged from the data on an information board at the now closed Bristol Aeroplane Company Museum at Kemble Airfield, Kemble, Gloucestershire, where a complete Bloodhound could be seen, since moved to Aerospace Bristol. The Mark of Bloodhound this data refers to is not given but is presumably the Mark II since the top speed of the Mk. I is Mach 2.2: &quot;By the time the missile has just cleared the launcher it is doing 400 mph. By the time the missile is 25 feet from the launcher it has reached the speed of sound (around 720 mph). Three seconds after launch, as the four boost rockets fall away, it has reached Mach 2.5 which is roughly 1,800 mph&quot;

===Mk III===
The planned Mk III (also known as RO 166) was a Mark II with 6 kiloton nuclear warhead and a range of around achieved with an improved ramjet engine and bigger boosters. The project, one of several adaptations of existing British missiles to carry tactical nuclear devices, was cancelled in 1960. There is evidence that the intention was to &quot;poison&quot; the warheads of nuclear weapons carried by an attacking force via the neutron flux emitted by the warhead.

===Mk IV===
This would have been a mobile version of Bloodhound.

<text>The Lanham (Trademark) Act (, codified at et seq. () is the primary federal statute governing trademark law in the United States. 

The Lanham Act establishes a national system of trademark registration and grants owners of federally registered trademarks the right to pursue civil remedies for trademark infringement, trademark dilution, cybersquatting, and false advertising.

==History==
Named for Representative Fritz G. Lanham of Texas, the Act was passed on July 5, 1946, and signed into law by President Harry Truman, taking effect &quot;one year from its enactment&quot;, on July 6, 1947. In rare circumstances, a conflict will arise between trademarks that have been in use since before the Lanham Act went into effect, thus requiring the courts to examine the dispute according to the trademark act that existed before the Lanham Act.

Before its enactment, trademarks relied solely on protection under state-level common law. Subsequent federal laws proved ineffective, leading to confusion and inadequate safeguarding of marks. Trademarks persisted indefinitely, even if unused. The Lanham Act emerged as a long-awaited solution, aiming to comprehensively regulate the creation and utilization of trademarks, offering protection to both trademark owners and consumers.

The Act has been amended several times since its enactment. Its impact was significantly enhanced by the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984, which made the intentional use of a counterfeit trademark or the unauthorized use of a counterfeit trademark an offense under Title 18 of the United States Code, and enhanced enforcement remedies through the use of &quot;ex parte&quot; seizures and the award of treble profits or damages (whichever is greater).

In 1999, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act inserted , and amended .

===Civil enforcement===
§§ 32 and 43 of the Act (now known as ) set out the remedies that can be sought when a trademark is infringed. Notably, Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act focuses on false advertising and unfair competition, providing a legal recourse for individuals and businesses. This section enables legal action against those engaging in misleading advertising practices that may cause confusion about the origin of goods or services. A crucial provision within Section 43(a) allows any person who anticipates damage from false advertising to initiate a civil action. These provisions forbid the importation of goods that infringe registered trademarks, and restrict, through the use of injunctions and damages, the use of false descriptions and trademark dilution.

§ 43(a) () is the &quot;likelihood of confusion&quot; standard for infringement of an unregistered trademark or trade dress, and courts still frequently refer to the provision as &quot;Section 43(a)&quot;:

 is often used when false or misleading statements are alleged to have hurt a consumer or business. The claimant must prove that a false or misleading statement was made in commerce and that the statement creates a likelihood of harm to the plaintiff.

 is often used when false or misleading statements are alleged to have hurt a business.

===Jurisprudence===

The Act has been held to have extraterritorial impact, and the circuit courts have been giving more favorable interpretations in extending its scope. The original ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States, as interpreted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, contemplates a three-part test in determining whether the Act applies (where at least two factors must be met):

#the conduct of the defendant must have a substantial effect on United States commerce,
#the defendant must be a United States citizen, and
#there must be an absence of conflict with foreign law.

Although the Lanham Act sets out clear parameters as to what constitutes trademark infringement, subsequent court decisions, especially those involving the Internet, have loosened the strictures.

In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law had no impact on public domain works in &quot;Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.&quot;

In 2014, the various interpretations that had been adopted by the circuit courts as to who had standing to sue under were ousted by the Court in &quot;Lexmark Int&#x27;l v. Static Control Components&quot;, where Justice Scalia adopted a multi-step approach:

#Under Article III, the plaintiff must have suffered or be imminently threatened with a concrete and particularized &quot;injury in fact&quot; that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.
#&quot;AGC&quot; requires the ascertainment, as a matter of statutory interpretation, of the &quot;scope of the private remedy created by&quot; Congress, and the &quot;class of persons who [could] maintain a private damages action under&quot; a legislatively conferred cause of action.
#A statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests &quot;fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked,&quot; and the &quot;zone of interests&quot; formulation applies to all statutorily created causes of action, as it is a &quot;requirement of general application&quot; and Congress is presumed to &quot;legislat[e] against the background of&quot; it, &quot;which applies unless it is expressly negated.&quot;
#A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute. A plaintiff suing under §1125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant&#x27;s advertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.
#Direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue under §1125(a).

In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.&quot; that the Act complemented the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, allowing a company to sue for infringement by way of civil action.

In 2017 &quot;Matal v. Tam&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision in of the Act, denying registration to any trademarks seen as disparaging an individual or group, was an unconstitutional restriction of applicants&#x27; freedom of speech.

In 2019 &quot;Iancu v. Brunetti&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that a provision in of the Act, denying registration to any trademarks seen as consisting of immoral or scandalous matter, was an unconstitutional restriction of applicants&#x27; freedom of speech.

==Divisions==
In the United States Code, the Act has been divided into four subchapters:

===The Trademark Registers===
Subchapter I sets forth the requirements that a mark must meet to receive a registration on the Principal Register, which bestows various rights on the trademark owner to prevent others from infringing their mark. Among the requirements are prohibitions against the registration of marks that are confusingly similar to existing marks, are generic or merely descriptive, are scandalous or immoral, or fall onto certain other prohibited categories. Subchapter I also sets forth certain procedural requirements, such as the submission of an affidavit of continued use after five years of registration.

Subchapter II sets forth a form of registration on the Supplemental Register, for certain marks that are unregistrable under Subchapter I, but may become registrable in the future, such as those that are merely descriptive. This form of registration, while not granting all the protections of registration on the Principal Register, does provide notice to potential infringers that the mark is in use, and also provides some procedural benefits.

<text>Caillou ( ; , stylized in lowercase) is an animated educational children&#x27;s television series that aired on Teletoon (both English and French versions) with the first episode airing on the former channel on September 15, 1997 until the fourth season. After that, the fifth season channel was moved to Treehouse TV, and the series finale aired on April 17, 2011. It also aired on PBS and the PBS Kids Channel.

Based on the books by Hélène Desputeaux, it focuses on a four-year-old boy named Caillou who is fascinated by the world around him. The series was produced in Canada by the CINAR Corporation (later Cookie Jar Entertainment), while the fifth and final season was produced in association with the South African studio Clockwork Zoo.

In 2023, it was announced that the show would be rebooted. It was originally set to premiere on Peacock with 52 eleven-minute episodes some time in 2023, but ultimately began streaming on February 15, 2024, with a batch of seven episodes.

==Plot==
Caillou lives with his family (his mother Doris, father Boris, younger sister Rosie, and pet cat Gilbert). He has many adventures with his family and friends, and uses his imagination in every episode.

During the first season, many of the stories in the animated version began with a grandmother (who is also the show&#x27;s narrator) introducing the story to her grandchildren, then reading the story from a book. Starting in the second season, the narrator and grandmother is an unseen character.

In PBS Kids, each episode in season 1 through season 3 has a theme and is divided into several short sections that mix animation, puppet skits, and video of live-action children in real-life situations. In seasons 4 and 5, the episodes are divided into three short sections; the puppet segment was dropped, alongside the &quot;Real Kids&quot; version of the segment.

===Major characters===
====Caillou====
Caillou (voiced first by Bryn McAuley from 1997 to 2000, then Jaclyn Linetsky from 2000 until her death in 2003, and then Annie Bovaird from 2003 to 2010) meaning &quot;pebble&quot; or &quot;stone&quot; in French (nicknamed by himself The Prince of Imagination), is the title character of the show. Caillou was first shown in the episode &quot;Caillou Makes Cookies&quot;, which aired in 1997.

Caillou is an imaginative four-year-old boy with a love for forms of transportive machinery such as rocket ships and airplanes. A dreamer, Caillou is inclined to frequent dream sequences in some episodes, visualizing his daydreams and wishes, and many episodes describe his normal daily experiences with his parents, friends, and neighbours. Caillou particularly loves his stuffed dinosaur, Rexy, and teddy bear, Teddy, along with his pet cat Gilbert, all of whom are depicted as puppets in segments featured in the earlier episodes. He is Boris and Doris’ son as well as Rosie&#x27;s older brother.

====Caillou&#x27;s family====
* Rosie (voiced by Brigid Tierney, then Jesse Vinet, known in French as &quot;Mousseline&quot;) – Caillou&#x27;s lively younger sister and Boris and Doris&#x27; daughter who is a typical toddler. She is two years old. She always wants to take part in the same activities as Caillou. In later seasons of the series, she becomes more talkative and independent. She wears a blue dress, red socks and blue Mary Jane shoes. Rosie fights with Caillou for some reasons, but they still love each other. She appears to be the only family member with red hair.
* Doris/Mommy (voiced by Jennifer Seguin) – Caillou and Rosie&#x27;s mother as well as Boris&#x27; wife and Grandma and Grandpa&#x27;s daughter-in-law. She is a busy homemaker most of the time but is seen to work in an office, as well. Caillou occasionally helps his mother with different chores, and she often takes time to involve Caillou and his friends in activities such as crafts and baking. She is predominantly dressed in a red blouse with yellow trim, blue headband, ankle-length blue jeans and blue shoes with green soles.
* Boris/Daddy (voiced by Pat Fry) – Caillou and Rosie&#x27;s father as well as Doris’ husband. He wears a green sweater with a red trim with blue jeans. In the episode &quot;Caillou The Chef&quot; he says he once worked at a restaurant and made pizza. He and Caillou occasionally work on projects around the house together.
* Gilbert – Caillou&#x27;s pet cat. In the puppet segments, he is shown to be knowledgeable about things which are foreign to Rexy and Teddy.
* Grandma (voiced by Pauline Little) – Caillou and Rosie&#x27;s paternal grandmother as well as Doris’ mother-in-law. Grandma is a very active lady who loves the arts and the outdoors. She passes that love onto Caillou. Grandma often comes up with creative ideas to solve Caillou&#x27;s problems. She and Caillou paint and go bird-watching together.
* Grandpa (voiced by George Morris) – Caillou and Rosie&#x27;s paternal grandfather as well as Doris&#x27; father-in-law. He takes Caillou on adventures, often going on walks and riding the bus throughout the town where they reside. In &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Hiding Place&quot;, he showed Caillou a hidden area inside a tree in the backyard. In the episode &quot;Caillou Goes Camping&quot;, he and Caillou camp in the backyard. He is Daddy&#x27;s father and loves to tell stories about when Calliou&#x27;s father was a little boy. He wears a blue shirt.

====Caillou&#x27;s friends and neighbours====
* Paul Hinkle (also known as &quot;Mr. Hinkle&quot; and French name: &quot;Monsieur Lajoie&quot;) – Caillou&#x27;s neighbour, introduced in the 1998 episode &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Not Afraid Anymore&quot;. He has a gold tooth. In the episode &quot;Farmer for the Day&quot;.

* Leo (voiced by Johanne Garneau from 1997 to 2003, Vince Davies in &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Holiday Movie&quot;, Jonathan Koensgen from 2006 to 2008 and Graeme Jokic in 2010) – A boy who started out as a bully in the 1999 episode &quot;Caillou at Daycare&quot;, but quickly befriended Caillou in the same episode. They have been inseparable since. He is of Jewish faith and celebrates Hanukkah (stated in &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Holiday Movie&quot;).
* Clementine (voiced by Brigid Tierney and Sophie Uretsky) – Clementine was the first to befriend Caillou in the 1999 episode &quot;Caillou Goes to Daycare&quot;. She can get rather bossy for some reasons, but all in all she is pretty understanding. She is of African-Canadian descent. Caillou has a crush on her, as indicated in &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Valentines&quot; (season 4, episode 8).
* Sarah (voiced by Amanda Tilson) – Caillou&#x27;s friend, whom he first met in &quot;Caillou Goes Around the Block&quot;. She is of Chinese descent and celebrates Chinese New Year. She has a cousin in an episode where she invites Caillou to celebrate Chinese New Year. In another she invites him to school for &quot;Bring Your Younger Siblings to School Day&quot; because she has no siblings. Sarah has a pet cat named Olly and a dog named Murphy.
* André – A redheaded boy, André is introduced in the episode &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Big Friend&quot; and usually wears red sandals. According to the song &quot;Days of the Week&quot;, released on the Caillou music CD &quot;Caillou and Friends&quot;, Caillou plays with him every Saturday. André enjoys biking and soccer.
* Julie (voiced by Holly Gauthier-Frankel) – Caillou&#x27;s and Rosie&#x27;s teenage babysitter. She has blonde hair in a ponytail, and enjoys playing with Caillou and Rosie.
* Jason and Jeffrey – Identical twin brothers who are of Hispanic descent. They both enjoy eating pizza. Initially, they wore identical clothes. By Season 4, though, Jason began wearing a shirt with inverted colours so it&#x27;s easier to tell them apart. They are both in Caillou&#x27;s playschool class. The first episode they appeared in was &quot;New House, New Neighbors&quot;.
* Billy (voiced by Michael Caloz in season 1) – Clementine&#x27;s older brother. He is usually seen playing in a band with his friends or playing sports.
* Ann Martin (also known as &quot;Ms. Martin&quot;, she voiced by Ellen David) – Caillou&#x27;s preschool teacher. She has red hair and wears red overalls with a long-sleeved white shirt. According to the episode &quot;A Surprise for Ms. Martin&quot; her birthday is in June. This was stated in &quot;Caillou Goes to Daycare&quot;.
* Jonas (voiced by Brian Wrench) – Boris friend from before he met Doris. He lives on a ranch and has a horse named Lucky. Jonas appears in four episodes and in &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Holiday Movie&quot;.
* Emma – A girl in Caillou&#x27;s playschool class who dislikes loud noises, wearing red. It is stated in an episode that she has Type 1 Diabetes.
* Xavier – A boy in Caillou&#x27;s playschool class who has brown hair and wears blue overalls.

====The puppets====
The puppet segments were used only on the PBS broadcasts of &quot;Caillou&quot; from 2000 to 2003 as continuity to fill time usually taken up by commercial breaks during the original Teletoon broadcasts; later episodes on PBS did not include the puppet segment continuity.

* Gilbert (puppeteered by Bob Stutt) – Caillou&#x27;s pet cat and he is the leader of the group. He has greyish-blue fur with black stripes and loathes dogs with a passion. He especially dislikes the bulldog in the neighbourhood. In the puppet segments of the show, Gilbert often consists odes.
* Rexy (puppeteered by Pier Parquette and voiced by Rick Jones) – Caillou&#x27;s bluish toy dinosaur and speaks in a somewhat foreign accent, he is very playful. Rexy has the incapability to give a &quot;good&quot; hug. Rexy is noted for being rather pedantic. He is often teased about his speech impediment, and tends to react violently to any mention of it.
* Teddy (puppeteered by Frank Meschkuleit) – An old teddy bear that once belonged to Caillou&#x27;s father, and now belongs to Caillou, Teddy is reasonable and nice. He is somewhat pessimistic, but all in all, he just needs a hug.
* Deedee (puppeteered by Wendy Welch) – A brown squirrel, she has a bushy tail, and is often seen playing with Rexy. Deedee first appeared as a baby squirrel when Rexy found on the ground lost from her family. Deedee lives in Caillou&#x27;s backyard where most of the puppet segments take place. She never appeared in Season 3.

==Episodes==

&quot;Caillou&quot; consists of five seasons of 92 half-hour episodes, as well as the 90-minute Christmas film &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Holiday Movie&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Caillou&quot; books have been published by Chouette Publishing Inc. since 1989.

The series was originally broadcast in French in Canada, and the episodes were later translated into English. The original books were also in French. &quot;Caillou&quot; was designed primarily for toddlers. It was created by child developmental psychologists. In 1997, 65 five-minute episodes of &quot;Caillou&quot; were aired in Canada and in selected markets worldwide, including the US. In 2000 there were 40 30-minute episodes of the show, containing a mixture of the five-minute episodes plus new stories, songs, real kids segment and puppets. This was followed by another 16 30-minute episodes containing all-new stories in 2003. The film &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Holiday Movie&quot; was released on October 7, 2003. On April 3, 2006, a new set of 20 episodes finally premiered after a three-year hiatus. Caillou started attending preschool and there were new themes and a new opening. New character redesigns were handled by Travis Cowsill, a storyboard artist on Timon and Pumbaa and Invasion America. The show was renewed for a second and third season in 2003, and later a fourth season. The fifth season was animated by South Africa-based studio Clockwork Zoo.

On November 14, 2012, the fourth season of the series was pre-sold to PBS Kids in the United States.

==Reception and controversy==
===Critical response===
&quot;Caillou&quot; initially received generally positive reviews from television critics and parents of young children. The staff of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that its protagonist &quot;embellish[es] everything he sees with his rich imagination.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Caillou&quot; looks at the world through the eyes of its 4-year-old namesake [and] takes life&#x27;s not-always-so-simple lessons and presents them in a way preschoolers can understand,&quot; while Lynne Heffley of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;each animated episode is an unusually realistic reflection of a preschooler&#x27;s daily fun, family interaction, challenges, disappointments and misunderstandings as Caillou grows and learns to make sense of his world&quot;, also describing it as &quot;a virtual guidebook for parents and caregivers&quot;.

====Controversy====
As the years progressed, however, the show drew criticism for the perceived incorrectness of the lessons gleaned through numerous events, mostly from the first season, as well as some episodes from the second season and third season. In a &quot;National Post&quot; column, writer Tristin Hopper identified &quot;Caillou&quot; to be &quot;quite possibly the world&#x27;s most universally reviled children&#x27;s program.&quot; A common criticism towards the series is that the titular character behaves like a spoiled child and suffers no consequences from his parents for his behavior. Hopper once said: &quot;Unlike most children&#x27;s programming, Caillou makes almost no attempt to educate its young audience. There are no veiled math problems, spelling lessons or morality tales; it&#x27;s just calm, non-threatening, bright-coloured people navigating everyday tasks.&quot; These criticisms of the show&#x27;s titular character have been echoed on online platforms. &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; host John Oliver referenced Caillou in a comparison of boring things against net neutrality, going on to insult Caillou for its themes.

As Caillou appeared as a much younger child in the original line of children&#x27;s books, he originally had no hair. When illustrators found that adding hair made him look unrecognizable, it was decided that Caillou would be bald. This decision led to an internet meme asserting that the protagonist has cancer or pediatric alopecia.

==Broadcast==
&quot;Caillou&quot; first aired on Canada&#x27;s French-language Télétoon channel on September 15, 1997, and was the first show aired on the English-language Teletoon when it launched on October 17 of that year. The series was moved to Treehouse TV in 2010. &quot;Caillou&quot; made its US debut on PBS Kids on September 4, 2000, and ran on that network until December 27, 2020. Reruns started airing on PBS Kids Sprout (later known as simply Sprout) on its launch on September 26, 2005. While Sprout rebranded into Universal Kids on September 9, 2017, the show remained on the channel until it was taken off the line-up at the beginning of April 2019.

On January 5, 2021, PBS Kids announced on Twitter that they would no longer broadcast reruns of &quot;Caillou&quot;. &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that many parents and viewers celebrated the news of the cancellation, as they have complained that &quot;Caillou&quot; had taught their kids bad lessons and encouraged them to be bratty and whiny. On August 16, 2021, it was announced that Cartoon Network had acquired the US-broadcast rights to the show after PBS&#x27; rights expired, with reruns of the series airing on Cartoonito from September 13, 2021 to May 4, 2022 in its HD remastered form. PBS ultimately sold the rights for US$6.4 million. In Canada, Family Jr. continues to broadcast reruns since February 5, 2018. PBS Kids currently retains the physical media and streaming rights for the original series. Comcast/NBCUniversal acquired global streaming rights for the reboot series (via Peacock) as of 2022.

==Home video releases==
In the United States, Caillou videocassettes and DVDs have been released by PBS Distribution (Originally distributed through Warner Home Video until 2004, and then Paramount Home Entertainment from 2006 to 2010, and now self-distributed). From 2003 to 2006, the DVDs with puppets and Jaclyn Linetsky were compilations from 2003 through 2006, and one of them is in memory of Linetsky herself.

For the franchise&#x27;s 25th anniversary, a DVD/book combo pack reissue of &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Family Favorites&quot; was released on October 14, 2014, by PBS Distribution, while a DVD reissue of &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Holiday Movie&quot; was released on November 11, 2014 by NCircle Entertainment.

In Canada, Sony Wonder originally released Caillou on VHS and DVD, and after the closure of the division by Sony, were moved to Vivendi Entertainment Canada. Since 2012, Caillou DVDs are distributed by Entertainment One and after their purchase of Phase 4 Films in 2015, are released through the KaBoom Entertainment label.

==Music from the series==
In 2003, an album titled &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Favorite Songs&quot; was released by Kid Rhino under the Cinar Music imprint.

==Revival==
===YouTube series===
Beginning in late 2016, a new &quot;Caillou&quot; web series for YouTube premiered on the official Caillou channel and was later released onto Amazon Prime. These shorts are mainly remakes of older episodes and are produced by WildBrain Spark Studios, a subsidiary of WildBrain that produces original content for their WildBrain Spark network. However, the videos were not made available to YouTube users in the United States until 2021.

In August 2021, it was announced that Cartoon Network licensed the series for broadcast on US television.

===Reboot and specials===
In September 2021, WildBrain announced the production of five new 45-minute specials based on the franchise for Family Jr. These specials were the first &quot;Caillou&quot; related media to be produced in CGI animation, and focused on Christmas, Halloween, Family Day, Summer Vacation and National Anti-Bullying Day. The specials were produced by WildBrain Studios, with animation provided by IoM Media Ventures.

In June 2022, WildBrain announced they teamed with Comcast&#x27;s streaming platform, Peacock, to produce a new series of the show, consisting of 52 11-minute episodes to go along with those specials. It was set to premiere in 2023, with IoM also providing animation production as the specials are. Despite the specials being released on Peacock, it would later be confirmed to stream on February 15, 2024.

The first special: &quot;Rosie the Giant&quot;, which focuses on the effects of bullying, simultaneously premiered in Canada and the United States on Family Jr. and Peacock respectively on July 10, 2022.

The second special: &quot;Adventures with Grandma and Grandpa&quot;, which focuses on Caillou visiting his grandparents for a sleepover at their beach house, premiered on Peacock on August 25, 2022.

The third special: &quot;The Bravest Wolf Boy&quot;, which focuses on Halloween, premiered on Peacock on October 15, 2022.

The fourth special: &quot;The Silver Knight&quot;, which focuses on imaginative play, premiered on Peacock on November 13, 2022.

The fifth special, &quot;Caillou&#x27;s Perfect Christmas&quot;, which focuses on Christmas, premiered on Peacock on December 2, 2022.

<doc id="577577" wikidata="Q7115558" url="?curid=577577" title="Oxford–Cambridge rivalry">
<text>Rivalry between the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge is a phenomenon going back many centuries. During most of that time, they were the only two universities in England and Wales, making the rivalry more intense than it is now.

The University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, sometimes collectively known as &quot;Oxbridge&quot;, are the two oldest universities in England. Both were founded more than 800 years ago, and between them they have produced a large number of Britain&#x27;s most prominent scientists, writers, and politicians, as well as noted figures in many other fields. Yet for many of these centuries the two universities were unrecognisable as universities in the modern sense, as they were largely institutions for producing clergymen and were thus strongly tied to the Church. Competition between Oxford and Cambridge also has a long history, dating back to around 1208 when Cambridge was founded by scholars taking refuge from hostile townsmen in Oxford.

==Direct competition between the two universities==
Many annual competitions are held between Oxford and Cambridge, including the annual Boat Race. First contested in 1829, the race pits Cambridge University Boat Club against their Oxford counterparts over a four-mile (6 km) stretch of the River Thames. The very first Boat Race was won by Oxford, but Cambridge lead the overall series with 86 wins to Oxford&#x27;s 81, with one dead heat in 1877 (as of 2023). Recent races have been closely fought, with Oxford winning by the shortest ever margin of in 2003 and Cambridge winning in 2004 despite Oxford&#x27;s claims of a foul.

The other major Oxbridge competitions are the Rugby Union and Rugby League Varsity Match, the former being a rugby union game played annually. There have been 142 men&#x27;s matches played, with Cambridge leading Oxford 66 wins to 62 (Cambridge won the most recent match in December 2024), and 14 games have ended in draws. The first women’s match was played in 1988, with Oxford leading Cambridge 23 to 14 wins. The matches have historically been held at Twickenham stadium, with the campaign moving further north to the StoneX stadium (Barnet Copthall) in 2024. The Rugby Football Union chose to advertise the 2006 match with a campaign promoting inter-university rivalry: their advertising agency Lowe London produced posters showing the number of Prime Ministers produced by the universities (Oxford 26 – Cambridge 14), with the tagline &quot;It&#x27;s time to get even&quot;.

The Rugby League Varsity Match is a rugby league game played annually in March at The Stoop. Whilst not having the history of its Union counterpart, the fixture has been contested for over 30 years, and is broadcast live on Sky Sports. Cambridge currently lead the series 16–14, with one draw in 1994.

The Boat Race and the rugby Varsity Matches are notable in the UK in that they are the only university sports events that have any public profile outside the universities themselves; all three are screened live on national television and are widely covered in the national media.

All other significant sports have their own varsity match at some point during the year; some of these, such as the cricket fixture, the Ice Hockey Varsity Match and the Varsity Polo Match have attracted significant attention in the past. The results of all the varsity matches in The Varsity Games are aggregated and each year one university wins the Varsity Games title. Sportspersons who have competed at a Varsity Match in the prestigious Full Blue sports are eligible for an Oxford Blue or Cambridge Blue respectively.

At direct sporting competitions the rivalry can be heard in the customary insults used by members of each University. &#x27;Shoe the Tabs&#x27;, derived from Cantabridgian, is traditionally used by those from Oxford. Likewise, &#x27;GDBO&#x27;, or God Damn Bloody Oxford, is the response from Cambridge. 

==Oxbridge co-operation==
Despite the impassioned rivalry between the two universities, there is also much cooperation when the need arises. Most Oxford colleges have a sister college in Cambridge. Some Oxford and Cambridge colleges with the same or similar names are &#x27;sisters&#x27;: for example, Jesus College, Cambridge, and Jesus College, Oxford, or Magdalen College, Oxford and Magdalene College, Cambridge. However, namesakes are not always paired up: for example, St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, is the sister college of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, while St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, is the sister college of Balliol College, Oxford. Arrangements between sister colleges vary, but may include reciprocal offers of accommodation to students from the other university when they are visiting. Furthermore, a significant proportion of academic staff has at some point been a member of the &quot;other place&quot;.

Concerns are often raised that Oxford and Cambridge do not project a socially inclusive image to potential applicants from state schools, and thus Oxbridge students are disproportionately from wealthy backgrounds. The two universities have made individual and combined efforts in recent years to promote themselves to potential applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds. Each year, the Universities spend around £8 million on access schemes, and there is a designated Access Officer in every JCR and students&#x27; union.

Graduates of both universities are eligible for membership of the Oxford and Cambridge Club, a private members&#x27; club in London.

<doc id="577590" wikidata="Q1770695" url="?curid=577590" title="Hindustani classical music">
<text>Hindustani classical music is the classical music of the Indian subcontinent&#x27;s northern regions. It may also be called North Indian classical music or Uttar Bhartiya shastriya sangeet. The term &quot;shastriya sangeet&quot; literally means classical music, and is also used to refer to Indian classical music in general. It is played on instruments like the veena, sitar and sarod. It diverged in the 12th century CE from Carnatic music, the classical tradition of Southern India. While Carnatic music largely uses compositions written in Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Hindustani music largely uses compositions written in Hindi, Urdu, Braj, Avadhi, Bhojpuri, Bengali, Rajasthani, Marathi and Punjabi.

Knowledge of Hindustani classical music is taught through a network of classical music schools, called &quot;gharana&quot;. Hindustani classical music is an integral part of the culture of India and is performed across the country and internationally. Exponents of Hindustani classical music, including Ustad Bismillah Khan, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, and Ravi Shankar have been awarded the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award of India, for their contributions to the arts.

== History ==
Around the 12th century, Hindustani classical music diverged from what eventually came to be identified as Carnatic classical music. The central notion in both systems is that of a melodic musical mode or &quot;raga&quot;, sung to a rhythmic cycle or &quot;tala&quot;. It is melodic music, with no concept of harmony. These principles were refined in the musical treatises &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, by Bharata (2nd–3rd century CE), and &quot;Dattilam&quot; (probably 3rd–4th century CE).

In medieval times, the melodic systems were fused with ideas from Persian music, particularly through the influence of Sufi composers like Amir Khusro, and later in the Mughal courts, noted composers such as Tansen flourished, along with religious groups like the Vaishnavites. Artists such as Dalptaram, Mirabai, Brahmanand Swami and Premanand Swami revitalized classical Hindustani music in the 16-18th century.

After the 16th century, the singing styles diversified into different gharanas patronized in different princely courts. Around 1900, Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande consolidated the musical structures of Hindustani classical music, called ragas, into a few thaats based on their notes. This is a very flawed system but is somewhat useful as a heuristic.

Distinguished musicians who are Hindu may be addressed as &quot;Pandit&quot; and those who are Muslim as &quot;Ustad&quot;. An aspect of Hindustani music going back to Sufi times is the tradition of religious neutrality: Muslim ustads may sing compositions in praise of Hindu deities, and Hindu pandits may sing similar Islamic compositions.

Vishnu Digambar Paluskar in 1901 founded the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, a school to impart formal training in Hindustani classical music with some historical Indian Music. This was a school open to all and one of the first in India to run on public support and donations, rather than royal patronage. Many students from the School&#x27;s early batches became respected musicians and teachers in North India. This brought respect to musicians, who were treated with disdain earlier. This also helped spread of Hindustani classical music to masses from royal courts.

=== Sanskritic tradition ===

Ravana and Narada from Hindu tradition are accomplished musicians; Saraswati with her veena is the goddess of music. Gandharvas are presented as spirits who are musical masters, and the gandharva style looks to music primarily for pleasure, accompanied by the soma rasa. In the &quot;Vishnudharmottara Purana&quot;, the Naga king Ashvatara asks to know the swaras from Saraswati.

While the term &quot;raga&quot; is articulated in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; (where its meaning is more literal, meaning &quot;color&quot; or &quot;mood&quot;), it finds a clearer expression in what is called &quot;Jati&quot; in the &quot;Dattilam&quot;, a text composed shortly after or around the same time as &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. The Dattilam is focused on Gandharva music and discusses scales (swara), defining a tonal framework called &quot;grama&quot; in terms of 22 micro-tonal intervals (shruti) comprising one octave. It also discusses various arrangements of the notes (&quot;Murchhana&quot;), the permutations and combinations of note-sequences (&quot;tanas&quot;), and &quot;alankara&quot; or elaboration. Dattilam categorizes melodic structure into 18 groups called &quot;Jati&quot;, which are the fundamental melodic structures similar to the raga. The names of the Jatis reflect regional origins, for example &quot;Andhri&quot; and &quot;Oudichya&quot;.

Music also finds mention in a number of texts from the Gupta period; Kalidasa mentions several kinds of veena (Parivadini, Vipanchi), as well as percussion instruments (mridang), the flute (&quot;Vamshi&quot;) and conch (&quot;Shankha&quot;). Music also finds mention in Buddhist and Jain texts from the earliest periods of the common era.

Narada&#x27;s &quot;Sangita Makarandha&quot; treatise, from about 1100 CE, is the earliest text where rules similar to those of current Hindustani classical music can be found. Narada actually names and classifies the system in its earlier form before the Persian influences introduced changes in the system. Jayadeva&#x27;s &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; from the 12th century was perhaps the earliest musical composition sung in the classical tradition called Ashtapadi music.

In the 13th century, Sharangadeva composed the &quot;Sangita Ratnakara&quot;, which has names such as the &quot;Turushka Todi&quot; (&quot;Turkish Todi&quot;), revealing an influx of ideas from Islamic culture. This text is the last to be mentioned by both the Carnatic and the Hindustani traditions and is often thought to date the divergence between the two.

=== During the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal era ===

The advent of Islamic rule under the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire over northern India caused considerable cultural interchange. Increasingly, musicians received patronage in the courts of the new rulers, who, in turn, started taking an increasing interest in local musical forms. While the initial generations may have been rooted in cultural traditions outside India, they gradually adopted many aspects from the Hindu culture from their kingdoms. This helped spur the fusion of Hindu and Muslim ideas to bring forth new forms of musical synthesis like qawwali and khyal.

The most influential musician of the Delhi Sultanate period was Amir Khusrau (1253–1325), a composer in Persian, Turkish and Arabic, as well as Braj Bhasha. He is credited with systematizing some aspects of Hindustani music and also introducing several ragas such as Yaman Kalyan, Zeelaf and Sarpada. He created six genres of music: khyal, tarana, Naqsh, Gul, Qaul and Qalbana. A number of instruments (such as the sitar) were also introduced in his time.

Amir Khusrau is sometimes credited with the origins of the khyal form, but the record of his compositions does not appear to support this. The compositions by the court musician Sadarang in the court of Muhammad Shah bear a closer affinity to the modern khyal. They suggest that while khyal already existed in some form, Sadarang may have been the father of modern khyal.

Much of the musical forms innovated by these pioneers merged with the Hindu tradition, composed in the popular language of the people (as opposed to Sanskrit) in the work of composers like Kabir or Nanak. This can be seen as part of a larger Bhakti tradition (strongly related to the Vaishnavite movement) which remained influential across several centuries; notable figures include Jayadeva (12th century), Vidyapati (fl. 1375 CE), Chandidas (14th–15th century), and Meerabai (1555–1603 CE).

As the Mughal Empire came into closer contact with Hindus, especially under Jalal ud-Din Akbar, music and dance also flourished. In particular, the musician Tansen introduced a number of innovations, including ragas and particular compositions. Legend has it that upon his rendition of a nighttime raga in the morning, the entire city fell under a hush and clouds gathered in the sky so that he could light fires by singing the raga &quot;Deepak&quot;.

At the royal house of Gwalior, Raja Mansingh Tomar (1486–1516 CE) also participated in the shift from Sanskrit to the local idiom (Hindi) as the language for classical songs. He himself penned several volumes of compositions on religious and secular themes and was also responsible for the major compilation, the &quot;Mankutuhal&quot; (&quot;Book of Curiosity&quot;), which outlined the major forms of music prevalent at the time. In particular, the musical form known as dhrupad saw considerable development in his court and remained a strong point of the Gwalior gharana for many centuries.

After the dissolution of the Mughal empire, the patronage of music continued in smaller princely kingdoms like Awadh, Patiala, and Banaras, giving rise to the diversity of styles that is today known as gharanas. Many musician families obtained large grants of land which made them self-sufficient, at least for a few generations (e.g. the Sham Chaurasia gharana). Meanwhile, the Bhakti and Sufi traditions continued to develop and interact with the different gharanas and groups.

=== Modern era ===

Until the late 19th century, Hindustani classical music was imparted on a one-on-one basis through the guru-shishya (&quot;mentor-protégé&quot;) tradition. This system had many benefits but also several drawbacks. In many cases, the shishya had to spend most of his time, serving his guru with the hope that the guru might teach him a &quot;cheez&quot; (piece or nuance) or two. In addition, the system forced the music to be limited to a small subsection of the Indian community. To a large extent, it was limited to the palaces and dance halls. It was shunned by the intellectuals, avoided by the educated middle class, and in general, looked down upon as a frivolous practice.

First, as the power of the maharajahs and nawabs declined in the early 20th century, so did their patronage. With the expulsion of Wajid Ali Shah to Calcutta after 1857, the Lucknavi musical tradition came to influence the music of the renaissance in Bengal, giving rise to the tradition of &quot;Ragpradhan gan&quot; around the turn of the century. Raja Chakradhar Singh of Raigarh was the last of the modern-era Maharajas to patronize Hindustani classical musicians, singers and dancers.

Also, at the turn of the century, Vishnu Digambar Paluskar and Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande spread Hindustani classical music to the masses in general by organizing music conferences, starting schools, teaching music in classrooms, devising a standardized grading and testing system, and standardizing the notation system.

Vishnu Digambar Paluskar emerged as a talented musician and organizer despite being blind from age of 12. His books on music, as well as the &quot;Gandharva Mahavidyalaya&quot; music school that he opened in Lahore in 1901, helped foster a movement away from the closed gharana system.

Paluskar&#x27;s contemporary (and occasional rival) Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande recognized the many rifts that had appeared in the structure of Indian classical music. He undertook extensive research visits to a large number of gharanas, Hindustani as well as Carnatic, collecting and comparing compositions. Between 1909 and 1932, he produced the monumental four-volume work &quot;Hindustani Sangeeta Paddhati&quot;, which suggested a transcription of Indian music, and described the many traditions in this notation. Finally, it suggested a possible categorization of ragas based on their notes into a number of thaats (modes), subsequent to the Melakarta system that reorganized Carnatic tradition in the 17th century. The ragas that exist today were categorized according to this scheme, although there are some inconsistencies and ambiguities in Bhatkande&#x27;s system.

In modern times, the government-run All India Radio, Bangladesh Betar and Radio Pakistan helped bring the artists to public attention, countering the loss of the patronage system. The first star was Gauhar Jan, whose career was born out of Fred Gaisberg&#x27;s first recordings of Indian music in 1902. With the advance of films and other public media, musicians started to make their living through public performances. A number of Gurukuls, such as that of Alauddin Khan at Maihar, flourished. In more modern times, corporate support has also been forthcoming, as at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy. Meanwhile, Hindustani classical music has become popular across the world through the influence of artists such as Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan and Vikash Maharaj.

== Characteristics ==
Indian classical music has seven basic notes with five interspersed half-notes, resulting in a 12-note scale. Unlike the 12-note scale in Western music, the base frequency of the scale is not fixed, and intertonal gaps (temperament) may also vary. The performance is set to a melodic pattern called a &quot;raga&quot; characterized in part by specific ascent (aroha) and descent (avaroha) sequences, &quot;king&quot; (vadi) and &quot;queen&quot; (samavadi) notes and characteristic phrases (pakad).

Ragas may originate from any source, including religious hymns, folk tunes, and music from outside the Indian subcontinent. For example, raga Khamaj and its variants have been classicized from folk music, while ragas such as Hijaz (also called Basant Mukhari) originated in Persian maqams.

== Principles of Hindustani music ==
The Gandharva Veda is a Sanskrit scripture describing the theory of music and its applications in not just musical form and systems but also in physics, medicine and magic. It is said that there are two types of sound: &quot;āhata&quot; (struck/audible) and &quot;anāhata&quot; (unstruck/inaudible). The inaudible sound is said to be the principle of all manifestation, the basis of all existence.

There are three main &#x27;Saptak&#x27; which resemble to the &#x27;Octaves&#x27; in Western Music except they characterize total seven notes or &#x27;swaras&#x27; instead of eight. These are-- low (&quot;mandra),&quot; medium (&quot;madhya)&quot; and high (&quot;tāra&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Each octave resonates with a certain part of the body, low octave in the heart, medium octave in the throat and high octave in the head.

The rhythmic organization is based on rhythmic patterns called tala. The melodic foundations are called ragas. One possible classification of ragas is into &quot;melodic modes&quot; or &quot;parent scales&quot;, known as thaats, under which most ragas can be classified based on the notes they use.

Thaats may consist of up to seven scale degrees, or swara. Hindustani musicians name these pitches using a system called Sargam, the equivalent of the Western movable &quot;do&quot; solfege:
* Sa (ṣaḍja षड्ज) = Do
* Re (Rishabh ऋषभ) = Re
* Ga (Gāndhāra गान्धार) = Mi
* Ma (Madhyama (music) मध्यम) = Fa
* Pa (Pancham पञ्चम) = So
* Dha (Dhaivat धैवत) = La
* Ni (Nishād निषाद) = Ti
* Sa (ṣaḍja षड्ज) = Do

Both systems repeat at the octave. The difference between sargam and solfege is that re, ga, ma, dha, and ni can refer to either &quot;Natural&quot; (&quot;shuddha&quot;) or altered &quot;Flat&quot; (&quot;komal&quot;) or &quot;Sharp&quot; (&quot;teevra&quot;) versions of their respective scale degrees. As with movable do solfege, the notes are heard relative to an arbitrary tonic that varies from performance to performance, rather than to fixed frequencies, as on a xylophone. The fine intonational differences between different instances of the same swara are called srutis. The three primary registers of Indian classical music are mandra (lower), madhya (middle) and taar (upper). Since the octave location is not fixed, it is also possible to use provenances in mid-register (such as mandra-madhya or madhya-taar) for certain ragas. A typical rendition of Hindustani raga involves two stages:

* Alap: a rhythmically free improvisation on the rules for the raga in order to give life to the raga and flesh out its characteristics. The alap is followed by a long slow-tempo improvisation in vocal music, or by the jod and jhala in instrumental music.
Tans are of several types like Shuddha, Koot, Mishra, Vakra, Sapaat, Saral, Chhoot, Halaq, Jabda, Murki
* &quot;Bandish&quot; or &quot;Gat&quot;: a fixed, melodic composition set in a specific raga, performed with rhythmic accompaniment by a tabla or pakhavaj. There are different ways of systematizing the parts of a composition. For example:
** Sthaayi: The initial, rondo phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition
** Antara: The first body phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition. Explores the upper octave of a Raag. In Khayal compositions, this is sometimes where the poet&#x27;s name can be found.
** Sanchaari: The third body phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition, seen more typically in dhrupad bandishes. Usually explores the lower section of a given Raag.
** Aabhog: The fourth and concluding body phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition, seen more typically in Dhrupad bandishes. Continues to explore the upper octave of a Raag just like an Antara, but with more expansive phrases. This is often where the poet&#x27;s name resides as a signature for Dhrupad compositions.
* There are three variations of bandish, regarding tempo:
** &quot;Vilambit bandish&quot;: A slow and steady melodic composition, usually in largo to adagio speeds
** &quot;Madhyalaya bandish&quot;: A medium tempo melodic composition, usually set in andante to allegretto speeds
** &quot;Drut bandish&quot;: A fast tempo melodic composition, usually set to allegretto speed or faster

Hindustani classical music is primarily vocal-centric, insofar as the musical forms were designed primarily for a vocal performance, and many instruments were designed and evaluated as to how well they emulate the human voice.

== Types of compositions ==
The major vocal forms or styles associated with Hindustani classical music are dhrupad, khyal, and tarana. Light classical forms include dhamar, trivat, chaiti, kajari, tappa, tap-khyal, thumri, dadra, ghazal and bhajan; these do not adhere to the rigorous rules of classical music.

=== Dhrupad ===

Dhrupad is an old style of singing, traditionally performed by male singers. It is performed with a tambura and a pakhawaj as instrumental accompaniments. The lyrics, some of which were written in Sanskrit centuries ago, are presently often sung in brajbhasha, a medieval form of North and East Indian languages that were spoken in Eastern India. The rudra veena, an ancient string instrument, is used in instrumental music in dhrupad.

Dhrupad music is primarily devotional in theme and content. It contains recitals in praise of particular deities. Dhrupad compositions begin with a relatively long and acyclic alap, where the syllables of the following mantra is recited:
 &quot;Om Anant tam Taran Tarini Twam Hari Om Narayan, Anant Hari Om Narayan&quot;.

The alap gradually unfolds into more rhythmic jod and jhala sections. These sections are followed by a rendition of bandish, with the pakhawaj as an accompaniment. The great Indian musician Tansen sang in the dhrupad style. A lighter form of dhrupad called dhamar, is sung primarily during the spring festival of Holi.

Dhrupad was the main form of northern Indian classical music until two centuries ago when it gave way to the somewhat less austere khyal, a more free-form style of singing. Since losing its main patrons among the royalty in Indian princely states, dhrupad risked becoming extinct in the first half of the twentieth century. However, the efforts by a few proponents, especially from the Dagar family, have led to its revival.

Some of the best known vocalists who sing in the Dhrupad style are the members of the Dagar lineage, including the senior Dagar brothers, Nasir Moinuddin and Nasir Aminuddin Dagar; the junior Dagar brothers, Nasir Zahiruddin and Nasir Faiyazuddin Dagar; and Wasifuddin, Fariduddin, and Sayeeduddin Dagar. Other leading exponents include the Gundecha Brothers and Uday Bhawalkar, who have received training from some of the Dagars. Leading vocalists outside the Dagar lineage include the Mallik family of Darbhanga tradition of musicians; some of the leading exponents of this tradition were Ram Chatur Mallick, Siyaram Tiwari, and Vidur Mallick. At present Prem Kumar Mallick, Prashant and Nishant Mallick are the Dhrupad vocalists of this tradition. A Very ancient 500 years old Dhrupad Gharana from Bihar is Dumraon Gharana, Pt. Tilak Chand Dubey, Pt. Ghanarang Baba was founder of this prestigious Gharana.Dumraon Gharana Dist-Buxar is an ancient tradition of Dhrupad music nearly 500 years old. This Gharana flourished under the patronage of the king of Dumraon Raj. The dhrupad style (vanis) of the gharana is Gauhar, Khandar and Nauharvani. The living legends of this gharana is Pt. Ramjee Mishra.

A section of dhrupad singers of Delhi Gharana from Mughal emperor Shah Jahan&#x27;s court migrated to Bettiah under the patronage of the Bettiah Raj, giving rise to the Bettiah Gharana.

===Khyal===
Khyal is the modern Hindustani form of vocal music. Khyal, literally meaning &quot;thought&quot; or &quot;imagination&quot; in Hindustani and derived from the Persian/Arabic term, is a two- to eight-line lyric set to a melody. Khyal contains a greater variety of embellishments and ornamentations compared to dhrupad. Khyal&#x27;s features such as &quot;sargam&quot; and &quot;taan&quot; as well as movements to incorporate dhrupad-style &quot;alap&quot; have led to it becoming popular.

The importance of the khyal&#x27;s content is for the singer to depict, through music in the set raga, the emotional significance of the khyal. The singer improvises and finds inspiration within the raga to depict the khyal.

The origin of Khyal is controversial, although it is accepted that this style was based on dhrupad and influenced by other musical traditions. Many argue that Amir Khusrau created the style in the late 14th century. This form was popularized by Mughal Emperor Mohammad Shah through his court musicians; some well-known composers of this period were Sadarang, Adarang, and Manrang.

=== Tarana ===

Another vocal form, taranas are medium- to fast-paced songs that are used to convey a mood of elation and are usually performed towards the end of a concert. They consist of a few lines of bols either from the rhythmic language of Tabla, Pakhawaj, or Kathak dance set to a tune. The singer uses these few lines as a basis for fast improvisation. The tillana of Carnatic music is based on the tarana, although the former is primarily associated with dance.

=== Tappa ===

Tappa is a form of Indian semi-classical vocal music whose specialty is its rolling pace based on fast, subtle, knotty construction. It originated from the folk songs of the camel riders of Punjab and was developed as a form of classical music by Mian Ghulam Nabi Shori or Shori Mian, a court singer for Asaf-Ud-Dowlah, the Nawab of Awadh. &quot;Nidhubabur Tappa&quot;, or tappas sung by Nidhu Babu were very popular in 18th and 19th-century Bengal.

=== Thumri ===

Thumri is a semi-classical vocal form said to have begun in Uttar Pradesh with the court of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, (r. 1847–1856). There are three types of thumri: poorab ang, Lucknavi, and Punjabi thumri. The lyrics are primarily in older, more rural Hindi dialects such as Brij Bhasha, Awadhi, and Bhojpuri. The themes covered are usually romantic in nature, hence giving more importance to lyrics rather than Raag, and bringing out the storytelling qualities of music. The need to express these strong emotional aesthetics makes Thumri and Kathak a perfect match, which, before Thumri became a solo form, were performed together.

Some recent performers of this genre are Abdul Karim Khan, the brothers Barkat Ali Khan and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Begum Akhtar, Nirmala Devi, Girija Devi, Prabha Atre, Siddheshwari Devi, Shobha Gurtu, and Chhannulal Mishra.

=== Ghazal ===

In the Indian sub-continent during Mughal rule, the Persian Ghazal became the most common poetic form in the Urdu language and was popularized by classical poets like Mir Taqi Mir, Ghalib, Daagh, Zauq and Sauda amongst the North Indian literary elite. The Ghazal genre is characterized by its romance, and its discourses on the various shades of love. Vocal music set to this mode of poetry is popular with multiple variations across Central Asia, the Middle East, as well as other countries and regions of the world.

==Instruments==
Although Hindustani music clearly is focused on vocal performance, instrumental forms have existed since ancient times. In fact, in recent decades, especially outside South Asia, instrumental Hindustani music is more popular than vocal music, partly due to a somewhat different style and faster tempo, and partly because of a language barrier for the lyrics in vocal music.

Many musical instruments are associated with Hindustani classical music. The veena, a string instrument, was traditionally regarded as the most important, but few play it today and it has largely been superseded by its cousins the sitar and the sarod, both of which owe their origin to Persian influences. The tambura is also regarded as one of the most important instruments, due to its functioning as a fundamental layer that the rest of the instruments adhere to throughout a performance. Among bowed instruments, the sarangi and violin are popular. The bansuri, shehnai and harmonium are important wind instruments. In the percussion ensemble, the tabla and the pakhavaj are the most popular. Rarely used plucked or struck string instruments include the surbahar, sursringar, santoor, and various versions of the slide guitar. Various other instruments have also been used in varying degrees.

==Festivals==
One of the earliest modern music festivals focusing on Hindustani classical music was the Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan, founded in 1875 in Jallandhar.  Sankatmochan sangeet Samarth  Varanasi,Dover Lane Music Conference notably debuted in 1952 in Kolkata and Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Festival in 1953 in Pune, while festivals such as the ITC SRA Sangeet Sammelan appeared in the early 1970s. The Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music And Culture Amongst Youth SPIC MACAY since 1977,Pandit Nanhku Maharajsince 1995 is a voluntary youth movement which promotes intangible aspects of Indian cultural heritage by promoting Indian classical music and other traditional art forms of India.

<text>Sylhet Division () is the northeastern division of Bangladesh. It is bordered by the Indian states of Meghalaya, Assam and Tripura to the north, east and south respectively, and by the divisions of Chittagong to the southwest and Dhaka and Mymensingh to the west. 

Prior to the Partition in 1947, it included Karimganj subdivision (presently in Barak Valley, Assam, India). However, Karimganj (including the thanas of Badarpur, Patharkandi and Ratabari) was inexplicably severed from Sylhet by the Radcliffe Boundary Commission. According to Niharranjan Ray, it was partly due to a plea from a delegation led by Abdul Matlib Mazumdar.

==Etymology==

The Sylhet Division is named after its headquarters, the city of Sylhet. Sylhet is the anglicisation of (&quot;Śilhôṭ&quot;), one of the archaic native names for the city. The local name is generally thought to be directly derived from (&quot;Śrīhaṭṭa&quot;), the Sanskrit name of the city. The city of Śrīhaṭṭa takes its name from &quot;Śrīhaṭṭanātha&quot;, the tutelary deity of the Nātha dynasty who promoted the early settlement of Nāthas in the Surma and Barak valleys between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, founding the Śrīhaṭṭa &quot;janapada&quot; and establishing &quot;Śrīhaṭṭanātha&quot; idols across the region. The later Hindu rajas of Sylhet, such as Gour Govinda, continued to pay tribute to the deity as &quot;Hāṭkeśvara&quot; or &quot;Haṭṭanātha&quot; as evident from the Devipurana and copper-plate inscriptions.

==History==
In 1874, the current Sylhet Division, which included Karimganj District, was entirely known as the &#x27;Sylhet district&#x27;. On 16 February 1874, Sylhet was separated from mainland Bengal to be made a part of the non-regulation Chief Commissioner&#x27;s Province of Assam (Northeast Frontier Province) in order to facilitate Assam&#x27;s commercial development. The people of Sylhet submitted a memorandum to the Viceroy protesting the inclusion in Assam. The protests subsided when the Viceroy, Lord Northbrook, visited Sylhet to reassure the people that education and justice would be administered from Bengal, and when the people in Sylhet saw the opportunity of employment in tea estates in Assam and a market for their produce. In 1905, Sylhet district rejoined Bengal as a part of the new &quot;Surma Valley Division&quot; of Eastern Bengal and Assam. In 1912, the then Sylhet district was once again moved to the newly created Assam Province alongside the other districts of the Surma Valley Division.

Historically, the entire Sylhet region was a single district within the &quot;Surma Valley and Hill Districts&quot; Division as part of the Assam Province. In 1947, a referendum was held in the Sylhet district, the people of the whole district voting in favour of succession to Pakistan. However, the district&#x27;s Karimganj subdivision was given to India by Cyril Radcliffe, after apparently being pleaded by a delegation led by Abdul Matlib Mazumdar. The four other subdivisions (North Sylhet, South Sylhet, Habiganj and Sunamganj) joined the Dominion of Pakistan; subsequently forming East Bengal&#x27;s &#x27;Sylhet district&#x27; in the Chittagong division.

Following the Independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Sylhet became part of the newly formed country. In 1984, the four subdivisions of Sylhet district were upgraded to districts as part of H M Ershad&#x27;s decentralisation programme. The four districts remained in the Chittagong Division until 1995 when they formed the new Sylhet Division.

The Sylhet Division has a &quot;friendship link&quot; with the city of St Albans, in the United Kingdom. The link was established in 1988 when the St Albans District Council supported a housing project in Sylhet as part of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. Sylhet was chosen because it is the area of origin for the largest ethnic minority group in St Albans. Sylhet also has many &quot;friendship links&quot; with other cities in the United Kingdom, as the majority of the half-million British Bangladeshis have origins in Sylhet. This includes places such as Rochdale, Oldham, London, and many more places.

==Economy==
The area around Sylhet is a traditional tea growing area. The Surma Valley is covered with terraces of tea gardens and tropical forests. Srimangal is known as the tea capital of Bangladesh; for miles around, tea gardens are visible on the hill slopes.

The area has over 150 tea gardens out of a total of 166 tea estates located all over Bangladesh, including three of the largest tea plantations in the world, both in terms of area and production. Nearly 300,000 workers, of which more than 75% are women, are employed on the tea estates. Employers prefer to engage women for plucking tea leaves since they do a better job than, but are paid less than, men. A recent drought has killed nearly a tenth of the tea shrubs.

The plantations, or gardens, were mostly developed during the British Raj, the Malnicherra Tea State being established in Sylhet in the year 1854. The plantations were started by the British, and the managers still live in the white timber houses built during the Raj. The bungalows stand on huge lawns. The service and the lifestyle of managers are still unchanged.

Numerous projects and businesses in the city and in large towns have been funded by Sylhetis living and working abroad. As of 1986, an estimated 95 percent of ethnic British Bangladeshis originated from or had ancestors from the Sylhet region. The Bangladesh government has set up a special Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in Sylhet, in order to attract foreign investors, mainly from the UK.

Sylhet has also benefited from tourism. There are many natural landmarks people tend to visit, such as the Keane Bridge, Ali Amjad&#x27;s Clock, Lalakhal, Jaflong, Madhabkunda waterfall, Ratargul Swamp Forest, Hakaluki Haor, Lawachara National Park, Tanguar Haor and Bichnakandi. Sylhet is also considered to be the spiritual capital of Bangladesh, due to the resting place of Shah Jalal, a Sufi saint who spread Islam in Bangladesh, along with hundreds of his disciples. The Sylhet Shahi Eidgah is a famous place where Eid prayers take place and it is one of the largest Eidgahs in Bangladesh, built by Farhad Khan during the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. There are a number of hotels and resorts, particularly in Sreemangal Upazila and Bahubal Upazila.

==Governance==
In 1995, Sylhet split from the Chittagong Division and was declared the 6th division of the country. The Sylhet Division is overseen by the Divisional Commissioner, the current Divisional Commissioner is Md. Mashiur Rahman. The Sylhet Division is divided into four districts (Habiganj, Moulvibazar, Sunamganj and Sylhet) and further divided into 35 upazilas (sub-districts). These upazilas are further divided into 323 union parishads. Each union is roughly divided into 9 wards before going to village-level. There are roughly 10,185 villages in the Division. The Division hosts 19 Municipal corporations known as pourashavas, and one city corporation in Sylhet city. It also has 19 Parliamentary constituencies. The headquarters of the Sylhet Division is the city of Sylhet in Sylhet Sadar Upazila, Sylhet District. Pre-partition Sylhet&#x27;s Karimganj has been governed by India since 1947.


==Geography==
Geographically the region is surrounded by hillocks (known as &quot;tilla&quot;s) from all three sides except its western plain boundary with the rest of Bengal. In the south of the region (Habiganj, Moulvibazar), eight hill ranges enter the plains of Sylhet running uniformly from the west to the east. They are: Raghunandan, Dinarpur-Shatgaon, Balishira, Bhanugach-Rajkandi, Hararganj-Singla, Patharia, Pratapgarh-Duhalia and Sorrispur-Siddheswar hill ranges. At the centre of the region is also an isolated range known as the Ita Hills.

The region is considered one of the most picturesque and archaeologically rich regions in South Asia. It is home to three national parks; the Lawachara National Park, Khadim Nagar National Park and Satchari National Park, as well as numerous smaller parks and forests such as the Ratargul Swamp Forest, Rema-Kalenga Wildlife Sanctuary. Its burgeoning economy has contributed to the regional attractions of landscapes filled with fragrant orange and pineapple gardens as well as tea plantations. The region has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) bordering on a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;) at higher elevations. The rainy season from April to October is hot and humid with very heavy showers and thunderstorms almost every day, whilst the short dry season from November to February is very warm and fairly clear. Nearly 80% of the annual average rainfall of occurs between May and September.

The physiography of the division consists mainly of hill soils, encompassing a few large depressions known locally as &quot;beels&quot; which can be mainly classified as oxbow lakes, caused by tectonic subsidence primarily during the earthquake of 1762.

Geologically, the division is complex having diverse sacrificial geomorphology; high topography of Plio-Miocene age such as the Khasi and Jaintia Hills and small hillocks along the border. At the centre there is a vast low laying flood plain of recent origin with saucer shaped depressions, locally called &quot;haors&quot;. There are many haors in the region and the largest ones include Hakaluki, Kawadighi, Tanguar and Hail. Available limestone deposits in different parts of the region suggest that the whole area was under the ocean in the Oligo-Miocene. In the last 150 years, three major earthquakes hit the city, at a magnitude of at least 7.5 on the Richter Scale, the last one took place in 1918, although many people are unaware that Sylhet lies on an earthquake prone zone.

=== Flora and fauna ===
The region is home to the Asian elephant and the One-horned rhinoceros, mostly towards the south. Tigers and leopards were once found throughout the region. Other notable fauna include the Sambar deer, Indian hog deer, Sylhet hara and Sylhet roofed turtle.

The Asian elephant were once found in small numbers in places such as Chapghat, Bhanugach, Chamtolla, Mahram and the Raghunandan hills. More abundantly they are found near streams in Singla and Langai.

==Culture==
===Language===

The official language of Sylhet is Standard Bengali, which is used in education and all government affairs in the division. Sylheti is the most widely spoken in the division. The Adivasis and tea labourers brought over during the British colonial rule also have their own native languages such as Khasi, Kuki, Laiunghtor, Meitei, Bishnupriya Manipuri, Hajong, Garo, Odia, Kurmi creole, Hindi, Bhumij and Tripuri.

===Architecture===

The intense building of mosques which took place during the Sultanate era indicates the rapidity with which the locals converted to Islam. Today, mosques are present in every Muslim-inhabited village. Bengali mosques are normally covered with several small domes and curved brick roofs decorated with terracotta. Ponds are often located beside a mosque.

Faujdar Farhad Khan built Sylhet Shahi Eidgah in the 1660s under the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It stands as the largest eidgah of the region.

In 1872, Nawab Moulvi Ali Ahmed Khan of Prithimpassa constructed Ali Amjad&#x27;s Clock, named after his son, in Sylhet City. In 1936, a bridge was constructed across the Surma River known as the Keane Bridge. These two historic landmarks are known as the &quot;gateway to Sylhet city&quot;.

Assam-type architecture developed in Sylhet region under Assam Province during the late modern period.

===Sports and games===

Cricket is the most popular sport in Sylhet. Regional cricket teams include Sylhet Thunder, East Zone and the Sylhet Division cricket team. Football is also a common sport and the multi-use Saifur Rahman Stadium are known to host football matches. Beanibazar SC has played in the Bangladesh League. The home stadium of the football club, Sheikh Russel KC, is in Sylhet District Stadium. Board and home games such as Dosh Fochish and its modern counterpart Ludo, as well as Carrom Board, Sur-Fulish, Khanamasi and Chess, are very popular in the region. Nowka Bais is a common traditional rowing competition during the monsoon season when rivers are filled up, and much of the land is under water. Fighting sports include Kabaddi, Latim and Lathi khela.

==Demography==
The division&#x27;s population is over 12 million and Bengalis make up a large majority of the region&#x27;s population. The tribal and Adivasi population tend to live in secluded rural areas of the region primarily near the hills and tea gardens. They are made up of several ethnic groups such as the Bishnupriya Manipuris, Khasi, Lalengs, Tripuris, Meiteis, Garos, and Kukis. In the nineteenth century, the British brought over indigenous peoples from other parts of British India to work as tea garden labourers such as the Kurmis, Musahars, Bauris, Beens, Bonaz, Sabar and Bhumij amongst others.

===Religion===

Islam is the largest religion in the whole region practised by the Bengali Muslims. Sunni Islam is the largest denomination with majority following the Hanafi school of law although some also follow the Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali madhhabs. There are significant numbers of people who follow Sufi ideals similar to the Barelvis, the most influential is the teachings of Abdul Latif Chowdhury Fultali of Zakiganj – a descendant of one of the disciples of Shah Jalal. The revivalist Deobandi movement is also popular in the region with Jamia Tawakkulia Renga being a notable centre and many are part of the Tablighi Jamaat. Haji Shariatullah&#x27;s Faraizi movement was very popular during the British period and Wahhabism is adopted by some upper-class families. The Ahmadiyya community is mostly concentrated in Selbaras, which was the ancestral home of Ahmad Toufiq Choudhury, the leader of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama&#x27;at Bangladesh.

There is a very small minority of Shia Muslims who gather every year during Ashura for the Mourning of Muharram processions. Places of procession include the Prithimpasha Nawab Bari in Kulaura, home to a royal Shia family, as well as Rajtila.

Hinduism is the second largest religion practised by the Bengali Hindus as well as majority of the Bishnupriya Manipuri, Beens, Bhumij, Bonaz, Sabar, Musahar, Kurmi, Lalengs, Bauris and Tripuri population. Sylhet has the largest concentration of Hindus in Eastern Bengal and is a part of the Shakta pitha.

Other minority religions include Christianity (including the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sylhet and Sylhet Presbyterian Synod), Ka Niam Khasi, Sanamahism, Songsarek as well as animism. In the early 20th century, there were over a hundred Marwaris from Rajasthan that were living in Sylhet, mostly as merchants and followed Jainism.

There was a presence of Sikhism in Sylhet after Guru Nanak&#x27;s visit in 1508 to spread the religion. Kahn Singh Nabha has stated that in memory of Nanak&#x27;s visit, &quot;Gurdwara Sahib Sylhet&quot; was established. This Gurdwara was visited twice by Tegh Bahadur and many hukamnamas were issued to this temple by Guru Gobind Singh. In 1897, the gurdwara fell down after the earthquake.

<text>Xavier Rudd (born 29 May 1978) is an Australian singer, songwriter, musician, and multi-instrumentalist. Several of Rudd&#x27;s songs incorporate socially conscious themes, such as spirituality, humanity, environmentalism and the rights of Indigenous Australians.

==Early life==
Xavier Rudd grew up in Jan Juc, near Torquay, Victoria. He attended St Joseph&#x27;s College, Geelong. His maternal grandfather was Dutch, born in Tilburg, a town in the Netherlands, before migrating to Australia. One of his grandmothers was from an Irish potato-growing family and grew up in Colac, Victoria. Rudd claims to be of Aboriginal, Irish and Scottish heritage, furthermore mentioning being of Wurundjeri ancestry, and that one of his great grandmothers was an Aboriginal Australian, and her child (Rudd&#x27;s paternal grandmother) was taken away from her.

Rudd showed a keen interest in music growing up in a family of seven children. While in primary school, Rudd used his mother&#x27;s vacuum cleaner as a makeshift didgeridoo and began playing his brother&#x27;s guitar. He also played saxophone and clarinet as a child.

As a child, Rudd sold recycled wood through his own furniture business. Immediately after finishing school, Rudd traveled to Fiji. He lived in villages around the country for nine months, returning to Australia at age 19.

==Career==
===1998–2002: early career to debut studio album===
Before launching his solo career, Rudd began playing music as part of the band &#x27;Xavier and the Hum&#x27;. He drew inspiration from artists such as Leo Kottke, Ben Harper, Natalie Merchant and multi-instrumentalist David Lindley, as well as music from diverse sources such as Hawaiian and Native American music. His music first took him overseas when he traveled to Whistler, British Columbia—Rudd was in a band and would play each night after a day of snowboarding.

Rudd was in Canada when the September 11 attacks happened. Rudd felt &quot;spun out&quot; watching the American media coverage, including graphic imagery of the destruction of the World Trade Center. Rudd wrote the song &quot;12 September&quot;, which would feature on his first studio album &quot;To Let&quot;, about the day after the attacks. In 2006, discussing the song, Rudd said: 

===2003–2005: &quot;Solace&quot; to &quot;Food in the Belly&quot;===
In 2004, Rudd released &quot;Solace&quot;, his first album to be distributed by a major label—Universal Music Australia. Rather than inviting guest artists to join him on the record, Rudd performed all the instrumentation for the album alone with only a few overdubs. Instruments included didgeridoos, slide guitars, stomp boxes, djembe drums, slit drums, and the harmonica. In his live show, Rudd came to be renowned for his &#x27;one-man band&#x27; performances.

Rudd recorded &quot;Food in the Belly&quot; in mid-2004 whilst on break from an extensive North American tour. The recording was made in May 2004 at Bowen Island, part of the Greater Vancouver Regional District.

===2007: &quot;White Moth&quot;===
The song &quot;White Moth&quot; was written about a moth that followed Rudd&#x27;s son Joaquin for several hours on his mother&#x27;s 30th birthday. Rudd thought it was the spirit of his then wife&#x27;s grandmother. Rudd and his family were holidaying to celebrate the occasion on an island off Sri Lanka.

In 2007, Rudd partnered with Clif Bar&#x27;s GreenNotes program to create the &quot;Better People Campaign&quot;. The campaign was about expressing gratitude to the people in the world taking steps to make positive change.

===2008–2011: &quot;Dark Shades of Blue&quot; to collaboration with Izintaba===
&quot;Black Water&quot; the first track on Rudd&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Dark Shades of Blue&quot; was named after one of Lutken-Rudd&#x27;s paintings. The album saw Rudd introduce a heavier sound, using electric guitars in place of acoustic guitars and creating darker more somber tones. He recorded with Dave Tolley, a percussionist drummer, who he had previously collaborated with for &quot;White Moth&quot; and &quot;Food in the Belly&quot;.

Reflecting on &quot;Dark Shades of Blue&quot;, Rudd told media he felt the heavier sound was a &quot;precursor for things that might come... I feel like my music is ahead of me all the time&quot;. Rudd was referring to his and Lutken&#x27;s divorce, which was finalised in 2009.

After the failure of his marriage, Rudd was supported in his grief and recovery by new South African bandmates, bassist Tio Moloantoa and percussionist Andile Nqubezelo. Rudd had met Moloantoa and Nqubezelo performing at the 2008 Wiesen Nuke Festival. Rudd described his connection with Moloantoa and Nqubezelo as musical, spiritual and emotional—&quot;I feel like they were sent to me&quot;, he said.

In 2010 Rudd bought 20 hectares of property at Koonyum Range, Mullumbimby, the location was the inspiration for the name of the album Rudd would release with Moloantoa and Nqubezelo, &quot;Koonyum Sun&quot;. The album moved away from the heavier sound of &quot;Dark Shades of Blue&quot; to a more up-beat style.

===2012: &quot;Spirit Bird&quot;===
In 2011, Rudd underwent emergency back surgery, to repair three herniated disks, bone spurs and nerve damage. Rudd wrote the track &quot;Comfortable in My Skin&quot;, on his 2012 album &quot;Spirit Bird&quot;, when he was suffering from major nerve pain before his surgery. In its entirety, the album sampled 30 species of Australian birds.

The song &quot;Spirit Bird&quot; came about after an encounter Rudd had with a red-tailed black cockatoo in the Kimberley. The encounter coincided with Rudd experiencing a powerful rush of imagery and emotion.

===2015: Rudd joins with the United Nations===
&quot;Nanna&quot;, the 2015 album Rudd released in collaboration with the United Nations, champions cultural understanding and condemns racism and intolerance. To record the album, Rudd and the United Nations worked with producer Errol Brown. In an interview published in The Aspen Times, Rudd shared that &quot;Nanna&quot; had given him a chance to focus on his vocal performance. He said that he had never really liked his voice before and vocals were often little more than an afterthought, but by 2016 was embracing it.

The song &quot;Shame&quot; on &quot;Nanna&quot; was inspired by conversations about racism surrounding AFL player Adam Goodes, an Aboriginal football player who was repeatedly booed at matches. Rudd had previously declared his support for Goodes addressing the AFL Players&#x27; Association 2014 Season Launch. At the time of writing the song &quot;Creancient&quot; for the album, Rudd was working with a Shaman in Peru. He participated in several ceremonies, including one that involved vomiting and experiencing hallucinations and another involving mud bathing. Rudd described the song as something that flowed out of him over a week while he felt like he was outside of himself, looking at his ego from a distance.

In late 2015, Rudd was forced to cut his North American tour for &quot;Nanna&quot; short to have disc replacement and fusion surgery in his lower back, having experienced chronic pain over several months.

In November 2015, Rudd&#x27;s song &quot;Let Me Be&quot; featured in an Australian TV commercial promoting KFC, a large fast food restaurant chain specialising in factory farmed fried chicken. Many fans used social media to complain about the inclusion of the song on the commercial. PETA responded that they hoped that Rudd had not approved the use of his music for the advertising.

===2021: new deal and &quot;Jan Juc Moon&quot;===
In April 2021, it was announced Rudd had signed with newly rebranded Virgin Music Australia. On 17 June 2021, Rudd released &quot;Stoney Creek&quot;, the lead single from his forthcoming tenth studio album.

In January 2022, Rudd released &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, the third single from his tenth studio album, &quot;Jan Juc Moon&quot;.

Rudd won the 2022 Environmental Music Prize for the 2021 single &quot;Stoney Creek&quot;.

In July 2023, Rudd released the single &quot;Road Trippin&#x27;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rudd often likes to spend time in the Australian bush in his 4WD Toyota Landcruiser, championing the traditional Aboriginal Australian way of life. His songs include stories of the mistreatment of the Indigenous people of his homeland. Rudd has taken part in several Aboriginal ceremonies. In 2003, he says he was adopted into the Dhuwa mob (one of two moieties of the Yolngu people) in northeast Arnhem Land. He has also spent time with people from several North American indigenous groups—the Cree, Mohawk and Iroquois.

Rudd is a keen surfer, having started when he was five or six years old, and says at times surfing inspires his music. He also enjoys snowboarding, one of the few activities he wears shoes for.

Rudd grew up in a Catholic family. When asked about his religious beliefs, Rudd has said &quot;I&#x27;m not religious in the sense that I don&#x27;t believe in a God and I don&#x27;t follow the tenets of organised churches, but I believe in nature and everything that surrounds me: I love Earth, the sun, the sea and animals. Music is my only church.&quot;

===Family===
Rudd was formerly married to Marci Lutken, an artist from Canada. They met when she was backpacking in Fitzroy, Victoria, in 1999. After getting pregnant, the two married, and eventually they had two sons. Rudd obtained Canadian dual citizenship. The marriage ended in 2009.

Rudd is married to Ashley Freeman-Rudd, an Australian former model, and dancer and holistic wellness trainer. They were married in a Byron Bay wedding ceremony and now live in the Shire of Noosa with their two children.

===Vegetarianism===

 Rudd became a vegetarian after passing Harris Ranch, California&#x27;s largest factory farm, during a United States tour. Rudd described in an interview with PETA how the experience made him change his diet, saying: 

Rudd was nominated for PETA&#x27;s annual &quot;World&#x27;s Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity&quot; award in 2007. In 2008, PETA named him sexiest Australian male vegetarian.

===Activism and causes===
In February 2009, Rudd performed at a public rally in opposition to residential development in Torquay.

Rudd received the &#x27;Rock the Boat Award&#x27; in 2009 for his support of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Rudd is friends with Canadian environmentalist Paul Watson, who founded Sea Shepherd. In January 2010, Rudd was one of the last passengers aboard Sea Shepherd ship &quot;Ady Gil&quot;, days before it sank after a collision with the &quot;MV Shōnan Maru 2&quot; Japanese whaling security vessel.

In 2012, Rudd was outspoken against Colin Barnett&#x27;s plan to open up the Kimberley to mining operations. He joined the Save the Kimberley movement to save James Price Point.

Working with volunteer organisations Surf for Life and Waves of Hope, Rudd worked alongside other volunteers to build a high school in northern Nicaragua in late 2013.

In 2014, Rudd performed at the Bentley (unrelated to the car company of the same name) anti-gas blockade campsite, in support of the Lock the Gate Alliance. He had previously travelled to the Doubtful Creek coal-seam gas test drilling site in February 2013 to voice his concerns about the gas drilling, saying: &quot;Our government is hopeless, ruthless and toxic in terms of protecting our land.&quot; The protestor&#x27;s actions at the Bentley Blockade, where they blocked the delivery of oil- and gas-drilling equipment for weeks, led the New South Wales Government to suspend Metgasco&#x27;s drilling licence.

In 2015, Rudd was criticised for selling the rights to his song &quot;Let me Be&quot; to the multi-national company KFC, well known for their factory-farmed chicken, in a television advertisement. The advertising campaign was widely criticised by fans, and the absence of a response or explanation by Rudd served to undermine his integrity relative to his activism.

==Live performances==
Rudd has become a known name at music festivals worldwide including the Bonnaroo Music Festival, the High Sierra Music Festival (2004 and 2007) and the Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival (2005), moe.down (2003), Summer Sonic, Lowlands, Rock Werchter, and others. He has toured with artists including Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews, Ben Harper, Good Old War, G. Love &amp; Special Sauce, and Rodrigo y Gabriela.

<doc id="577596" wikidata="Q6027409" url="?curid=577596" title="Indus Creed">
<text>Indus Creed is an Indian rock band based in Mumbai. The group was founded in 1984 as Rock Machine and renamed in 1993. They disbanded in 1997, only to regroup in 2010 with a new lineup.

In its 2014 listing of &quot;25 Greatest Indian Rock Songs of the last 25 Years&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone India&quot; featured the band&#x27;s songs &quot;Top of the Rock&quot; (1988) and &quot;Pretty Child&quot; (1990).

==History==
===Rock Machine===
Indus Creed was originally called Rock Machine, a group formed in 1984 by Mahesh Tinaikar (lead guitar), Mark Selwyn (bass), Ian Santamaria (vocals), Aftab Currim (rhythm guitar), and Suresh Bhadricha (drums). After playing just a few concerts in 1984, the lineup went through some changes. Jayesh Gandhi replaced Currim, Mark Menezes took Bhadricha&#x27;s chair, and Uday Benegal took over from Santamaria as lead vocalist. A few months later, Zubin Balaporia joined the band, adding keyboards. Tinaikar, Selwyn, Gandhi, Benegal, and Balaporia remained the core members of the band for a major portion of its existence.

Rock Machine started out as a cover band, playing a mix of mainstream rock and hard rock by such bands as Thin Lizzy, UFO, The Who, Deep Purple, Van Halen, and Rush. Rock Machine were one of the earliest bands in India to tour the country extensively, performing at colleges and independent rock festivals. The band eventually began to write and perform their own songs.

In 1988, Rock Machine released their first album, &quot;Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Renegade&quot;. Hailed as India&#x27;s first all-original rock album, it was a major success. The band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, was released in 1990 and featured a more slickly produced sound than their debut.

In 1992, Mark Menezes left Rock Machine and was replaced by drummer Bobby Duggal.

===Indus Creed===
Seeking a change of image and sound from that of a college-style band to a more internationally suited one, Rock Machine changed their name to Indus Creed in 1993. They began to experiment with Indian instruments, such as the tabla and sarangi. They also released a video to the song &quot;Pretty Child&quot;, which became a hit and won the band an MTV Asia Video Music Award.

In 1995, Indus Creed released their first album under the new name. The band also published two music videos from the self-titled record, &quot;Trapped&quot; and &quot;Sleep&quot;. The drummer&#x27;s chair saw yet another change when Bobby Duggal was replaced in 1995 by Adrian Fernandes.

===Disbandment===
Disillusioned with the way the music industry was changing in India, and with some members keen to embark on other musical pursuits, Indus Creed split up in 1997. Uday Benegal and Jayesh Gandhi moved to New York City at the end of 1999 with their new fusion rock band, Alms for Shanti, and released an eponymous album in 2000.

===Reunion===
In 2008, Uday Benegal relocated back to Mumbai, where he and Mahesh Tinaikar teamed up to create the acoustic project Whirling Kalapas. In 2010, Benegal and Tinaikar regrouped with ex-bandmate Zubin Balaporia to reform Indus Creed. They recruited bass player Rushad Mistry and drummer Jai Row Kavi to complete the outfit, now down to a five-piece from the original six-member group. The newly formed Indus Creed was officially launched on 7 October 2010, when they headlined Harley-Davidson&#x27;s Harley Rock Riders concert at Hard Rock Cafe Mumbai. In December 2010, the band embarked on their Reboot Tour, headlining concerts and festivals across India, including the Cherrapunjee Indigenous Festival in Meghalaya, Harley Rock Riders finale in New Delhi, Independence Rock Festival XXV in Mumbai, and the South Asian Bands Festival in New Delhi. In June 2011, Indus Creed was inducted into the Indian Recording Arts Academy Hall of Fame.

===&quot;Evolve&quot; (2012)===
Indus Creed released &quot;Evolve&quot;, their first album in seventeen years, on 21 April 2012, through Universal Music. Featuring eight songs, the album was produced by Indus Creed, mixed by Grammy-nominated mixing engineer Tim Palmer, and mastered by Andy VanDette. The band was subsequently featured on the cover of a number of magazines, including &quot;Rolling Stone India&quot;″s February 2012 issue.

Indus Creed was the big winner at the Jack Daniel&#x27;s JD Rock Awards 2013, held at Mehboob Studios in Mumbai, taking home Best Band, Best Keyboardist, and Best Drummer trophies for their album &quot;Evolve&quot;. They had been nominated in seven categories, including Best Album, Best Song, Best Vocalist, and Best Guitarist.
