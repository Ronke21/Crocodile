<text>Rania Al Abdullah (born Rania Al-Yassin, 31 August 1970) is Queen of Jordan as the wife of King Abdullah II. Rania&#x27;s domestic activities include education, youth, environmental, and health initiatives. Globally, she has campaigned for education and cross-cultural dialogue. She has authored three children&#x27;s books: &quot;The Sandwich Swap&quot;, &quot;The King&#x27;s Gift&quot;, and &quot;Enduring Beauty&quot;.

==Early life==
Rania Al-Yassin was born on 31 August 1970 in Kuwait, to Palestinian parents. Her father, Faisal Al-Yassin, was a Palestinian from Tulkarm in the West Bank. In 1991 Rania&#x27;s family was forced to flee Kuwait, along with thousands of other Palestinian refugees, and resettled in Amman, Jordan. She also has Turkish roots on her maternal grandfather&#x27;s side. Rania attended the New English School in Kuwait and subsequently received a degree in business administration from the American University in Cairo. Upon her graduation, she worked briefly in marketing for Citibank, followed by a job with Apple Inc. in Amman, Jordan.

==Personal life==
Rania met Jordanian Prince Abdullah bin Al-Hussein at a dinner party in January 1993. On 10 June 1993, they were married at Zahran Palace. Their wedding ceremony was considered a national holiday. The couple has four children:

*Crown Prince Hussein (born 28 June 1994 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman) who married Rajwa Al-Saif on 1 June 2023 at Zahran Palace in Amman; they have one daughter:
**Princess Iman bint Al Hussein (born 3 August 2024 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman)
*Princess Iman (born 27 September 1996 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman) who married Jameel Alexander Thermiótis on 12 March 2023 at Beit Al Urdun Palace in Amman; they have one daughter: 
**Amina Thermiótis (born 16 February 2025 at Prince Hashem bin Abdullah II Hospital in Aqaba)
*Princess Salma (born 26 September 2000 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman)
*Prince Hashem (born 30 January 2005 at King Hussein Medical Center in Amman) 
Abdullah ascended the throne on 7 February 1999, and proclaimed Rania queen on 22 March 1999.

Queen Rania is Muslim. Describing Islam, Rania stated that &quot;Islam is a religion of peace, tolerance and mercy. It is a source of comfort and strength for more than 1.6 billion Muslims.&quot;

==Activities==
Since her marriage, Rania has used her position to advocate for various sectors of society in Jordan and beyond.

===Domestic agenda===

====Education====

Queen Rania has launched and championed several initiatives in education and learning. She has stated that an essential aspect of education is to equip young people with the necessary skills to perform well in the workplace. She has said that education is a tool for individuals to empower themselves, allows the poor to improve their lives, and is an investment Jordan makes to protect its people from being exploited and falling victim to extremist ideology.

In July 2005, in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the King and Queen launched an annual teachers&#x27; award, the Queen Rania Award for Excellence in Education.

The Queen is chairperson of Jordan&#x27;s first interactive children&#x27;s museum, which opened in May 2007. In April 2008, the Queen launched &quot;Madrasati&quot; (&quot;My School&quot;), a public-private initiative aimed at refurbishing 500 of Jordan&#x27;s public schools over a five-year period. Rania also established The Queen Rania Al Abdullah Center for Educational Technology on 6 June 2001, aiming to use modern technology to serve and develop education in Jordan.

The Queen Rania Teacher Academy, which was launched in June 2009, provides professional development programs for current and new teachers in partnership with the Ministry of Education. The Queen Rania Scholarship Program partners with several universities from around the world to support scholarships and training for Jordanian students and workers in management, marketing, design, business administration, psychology, engineering, law, and other fields.

====Community and youth empowerment====

Queen Rania&#x27;s first venture was the establishment of the Jordan River Foundation (JRF) in 1995.

The Jordan River Children Program (JRCP) was developed by Rania to place children&#x27;s welfare above political agendas and cultural taboos. This led to the launch, in 1998, of JRF&#x27;s Child Safety Program, which addresses the immediate needs of children at risk from abuse and initiated a long-term campaign to increase public awareness about violence against children. The deaths of two children in Amman as a result of child abuse in early 2009 led Rania to call for an emergency meeting of government and non-government (including JRF) stakeholders to discuss where the system was failing.

In 2009, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of her husband&#x27;s accession to the throne, Rania launched a community champion award (Ahel Al Himmeh) to highlight the accomplishments of groups and individuals who have helped their local communities. Rania initiated the Al-Aman Fund for the Future of Orphans in 2003.

In her capacity as regional ambassador of INJAZ Al-Arab, Rania has taught classes and engaged in dialogue with young people in other countries; she also launched INJAZ Al-Arab&#x27;s presence elsewhere in the Arab world. She chaired a discussion with entrepreneurs in celebration of INJAZ Al-Arab&#x27;s 10th anniversary, showcasing alumni&#x27;s success stories At the 2008 World Economic Forum in Davos, she launched the &quot;Empowering One Million Arab Youth by 2018&quot; campaign, which was conceived by INJAZ Arabia.

==== Health ====
In 2005, Rania established the Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) to educate parents and children about the basics of nutrition and hygiene, the benefits of exercise, the harms of smoking, and other areas related to health.

In 2011, the first specialized medical building for children was built in Jordan, Queen Rania Children&#x27;s Hospital, established to improve the medical service for Jordanian children. The hospital provides for the care of children, especially complex medical cases including organ transplants and endoscopic operations.

===Global agenda===

====Global education====

In November 2000, in recognition of her commitment to the cause of children and youth, the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) invited Rania to join its Global Leadership Initiative. In early 2002 Rania joined the board of directors of the International Youth Foundation, based in Baltimore, Maryland, in the United States. In January 2007, Rania was named UNICEF&#x27;s first Eminent Advocate for Children. In August 2009, Rania became Honorary Global Chair of the United Nations Girls&#x27; Education Initiative (UNGEI).

As a longtime supporter of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), Rania met with children and inspirational women in South Africa, both in the cities of Johannesburg and Soweto, in March 2009. One of the stories in the book, &quot;Maha of the Mountains&quot;, was contributed by Rania.

During her April 2009 US trip, Rania joined leading education advocates Congresswoman Nita Lowey and Counsellor to the Secretary of the Treasury Gene Sperling to launch &quot;The Big Read&quot; as part of Global Campaign for Education&#x27;s global action week calling for quality basic education for all children. She was also hosted by first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, during that same trip.
On 20 August 2009, Rania co-founded and led the launch of the &quot;1GOAL: Education for All&quot; campaign alongside Gary Lineker, and with the help of top international footballers at Wembley Stadium, London. On 6 October 2009, Rania was joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the UK, the president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, and other heads of state, for the Global Launch of 1GOAL, which took place across six locations worldwide.

====Cross-cultural dialogue====

Rania has also been particularly vocal about the importance of cross-cultural and interfaith dialogue to foster greater understanding, tolerance and acceptance across the world. She has used her status to correct what she sees as misconceptions in the West about the Arab world.

Rania has played a significant role in reaching out to the global community to foster values of tolerance and acceptance, and increase cross-cultural dialogue. For example, regionally and internationally, Rania has campaigned for a greater understanding between cultures in such high-profile forums as the Jeddah Economic Forum, Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, and the Skoll Foundation in the UK. She has also made public appearances, including a half-hour television interview on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on 17 May 2006, where she spoke about misconceptions about Islam and especially women in Islam.

In September 2006, Rania also joined the United Nations Foundation board of directors. The UN Foundation builds and implements public-private partnerships to address the world&#x27;s most pressing problems, and broadens support for the UN through advocacy and public outreach.

====Microfinance====
In September 2003, Rania accepted an invitation to join the board of directors of the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA).

An emissary for the United Nations&#x27; International Year of Microcredit in 2005, Rania&#x27;s belief in microfinance and her partnership with FINCA has generated more Jordanian micro-businesses, with the official opening of FINCA Jordan in February 2008.

====Environment====
In October 2020, Rania was named as a member of the Earthshot Prize Council, an initiative of Prince William to find solutions to environmental issues.

===Social media===
====YouTube====

Rania has used YouTube, stated as a way to promote intercultural dialogue by calling on young people around the world to engage in a global dialogue to dismantle stereotypes of Muslims and the Arab world. On 30 March 2008, Rania launched her own YouTube channel, initially to invite viewers to give their opinions of the Middle East and talk about stereotypes they may have of Arabs and Muslims. Between 30 March and 12 August (International Youth Day), Rania posted videos on YouTube in which she asked people to send her their questions about Islam and the Arab world. She provided responses to those questions and explained her view of the truth about various Arab and Muslim stereotypes. Over five months she posted videos on subjects that included honour killings, terrorism and the rights of Arab women. International personalities such as Dean Obeidallah, Maz Jobrani, and YouTube star Mia Rose also contributed videos to the campaign.

In 2008, Rania participated in YouTube&#x27;s In My Name campaign. She appeared alongside The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am in the video, &quot;End Poverty – Be the Generation,&quot; which urged world leaders to keep the promises they made in 2000 at the United Nations Millennium Summit.

====Twitter====
To coincide with the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to Jordan on 8 May 2009, Rania started using the microblogging website Twitter with the username @QueenRania. On the occasion of the World Economic Forum held at the Dead Sea in Jordan, June 2009, she conducted her first Twitter interview, answering five questions from the general public via her Twitter account.

<text>Te Whiti o Rongomai III ( – 18 November 1907) was a Māori spiritual leader and founder of the village of Parihaka, in New Zealand&#x27;s Taranaki region.
A proponent of nonviolence, Te Whiti established Parihaka community as a place of sanctuary and peace for Māori many of whom seeking refuge as their land was confiscated in the early 1860s. Parihaka became a place of peaceful resistance to the encroaching confiscations. 

On 5 November 1881, the village was invaded by 1500 Armed Constabulary with its leaders arrested and put on trial. Te Whiti was sent to Christchurch at the Crown&#x27;s insistence after it was clear the crown was losing its case in New Plymouth.
The trial, however, was never reconvened and Te Whiti, along with Tohu were held for two years. 
Te Whiti and Tohu returned to Parihaka in 1883, seeking to rebuild Parihaka as a place of learning and cultural development though land protests continued. 

Te Whiti was imprisoned on two further occasions after 1885 before his death in 1907.

==Biography==
Te Whiti was born in Ngāmotu, Taranaki, New Zealand, about 1830. One account makes him the son of Hone Kakahi of the Te Āti Awa iwi and of Rangi Kauwau. Another version sees him as the son of Tohukakahi (a minor chief of the Patukai hapu of the Ngāti Tāwhirikura branch of the Te Ati Awa tribe), and of Rangiawau (daughter of Te Whetu).

As a youngster, Te Whiti was well educated by Māori elders, who taught him about the traditions of his culture. Educated at a mission school, he later set up a flour mill in Warea.

In 1862 Te Whiti saved the lives of the crew and passengers of the &quot;Lord Worsley&quot;,
which was wrecked on the Taranaki coast 80 km south of New Plymouth. When Māori threatened the survivors on the beach Te Whiti came to the rescue. He had a bullock killed and fed the survivors, sent a message to New Plymouth and arranged transport in carts to escort the survivors back to New Plymouth. This was the first occasion that government officials noted the existence of Te Whiti. He was believed to be about 30 at the time. In 1867 the great Māori chief established a village at Parihaka. He wanted his people to regain their land, pride and self-respect after the confiscations in other parts of the North Island. His aim seems to have been to establish a new way for Māori to resist European attempts to take what was left of Taranaki.

With his close relative, Tohu Kakahi, Te Whiti led the people of Parihaka in their nonviolent resistance to the confiscation of Māori land by the New Zealand Government.

It also appears preacher Minarapa Te Rangihatuake taught Te Whiti scripture and to read and write. Te Whiti also became a pupil of Lutheran missionary Johannes Riemenschneider. While the Parihaka prophet turned his back on all acts of violence, he wasn&#x27;t going to give up land without a fight. And so began his practice of passive resistance.

&quot;Though some, in darkness of heart, seeing their land ravished, might wish to take arms and kill the aggressors, I say it must not be. Let not the Pakehas (sic) think to succeed by reason of their guns ... I want not war, but they do. The flashes of their guns have singed our eyelashes, and yet they say they do not want war ... The government come not hither to reason, but go to out-of-the-way places. They work secretly, but I speak in public so that all may hear,&quot; Te Whiti told his people in March 1880.

By that time, Parihaka had become a stronghold of Taranaki-Māori opposition to the loss of tribal lands – the losses had arisen from the Land Wars of 1845-1872 and from subsequent Crown legislation on land confiscation. The government passed the Suppression of Rebellion Act 1863 to punish Māori &quot;rebels&quot; who had fought against the Crown – mainly in Taranaki and the Waikato. The Act defined Māori fighting against the government as &quot;rebels,&quot; who could be detained indefinitely, without trial. Te Whiti and Tohu Kakahi were incarcerated (1881 onwards), but Māori ploughmen came from all over the country to assist Taranaki Māori to re-occupy their confiscated land and to prevent the building of roads (May 1879 onwards). The New Zealand authorities arrested hundreds of Māori and confiscated their property. British newspaper reports of the Māori ploughmen&#x27;s non-violent struggle influenced the thinking of Indian nationalist Mahatma Gandhi during his sojourn in South Africa from 1893 to 1914.

<text>Sabal is a genus of New World palms (or fan-palms). Currently, there are 17 recognized species of &quot;Sabal&quot;, including one hybrid species.

== Distribution ==
The species are native to the subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas, from the Gulf Coast/South Atlantic states in the Southeastern United States, south through the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America to Colombia and Venezuela.

== Description ==
Members of this genus are typically identified by the leaves which originate from a bare, unarmed petiole in a fan-like structure. All members of this genus have a costa (or midrib) that extends into the leaf blade. This midrib can vary in length; and it is due to this variation that leaf blades of certain species of &quot;Sabal&quot; are strongly curved or strongly costapalmate (as in &quot;Sabal palmetto&quot; and &quot;Sabal etonia&quot;) or weakly curved (almost flattened), weakly costapalmate, (as in &quot;Sabal minor&quot;). Like many other palms, the fruit of &quot;Sabal&quot; are drupe, that typically change from green to black when mature.

== Taxonomy ==
The name &quot;Sabal&quot; was first applied to members of the group by Michel Adanson in the 18th century. Previous names that this genus was associated with include &quot;Corypha&quot;, &quot;Chamaerops&quot;, &quot;Rhapis&quot;. This section highlights important phylogenetic work done within the genus &quot;Sabal.&quot;

In 1990, Scott Zona outlined key morphological and anatomical characters that he used to analyze species relationships of &quot;Sabal.&quot; Through this analysis of characters, Zona produced a cladogram that portrays evolutionary relationships amongst 15 species of &quot;Sabal&quot;. Based on the distribution of species within his cladogram, Zona recognized four distinct clades. The clades within his study include (Clade 1) &quot;Sabal minor; (&quot;Clade 2) &quot;Sabal bermudana, Sabal palmetto, Sabal miamiensis,&quot; and &quot;Sabal etonia;&quot; (Clade 3) &quot;Sabal maritima, Sabal domingensis, Sabal causiarum, Sabal maurittiformis, Sabal yapa, Sabal mexicana,&quot; and &quot;Sabal guatemalensis;&quot; (Clade 4) &quot;Sabal uresana, Sabal rosei, and Sabal pumos&quot;. These clades associate closely with geographic distributions. Most of the species within Clade 3 occur in the Greater Antilles and southern Mexico, where species that occur in the Greater Antilles are more closely related to each other than those that occur in southern Mexico. Although Clade 4 also occurs in Mexico, these species occur on the west coast where they are geographically separated from the Mexican species within the southern part of the country. The remaining two clades, Clade 1 and Clade 2 predominantly occur in the southeastern United States although &quot;S. palmetto&quot; and &quot;S. minor&quot; are also known from Cuba and the Bahamas &quot;(S. palmetto)&quot; and northern Mexico &quot;(S. minor).&quot; &quot;Sabal bermudana&quot; is only known from Bermuda.

In 2016 Heyduk, Trapnell, Barrett, and Leebens-Mack conducted a new study on &quot;Sabal&quot; that analyzed molecular (e.g. nuclear, plastid) data from 15 species of the group. This study incorporated plastid and nuclear sequence data that together were used to estimate the relatedness between the species of &quot;Sabal.&quot; The results of the study show species relationships to be different from the distribution of Zona&#x27;s cladogram. Within the framework of this study, a major difference between the results of Zona and this study is the placement of &quot;Clade 4&quot; (&quot;Sabal uresana, Sabal rosei, and Sabal pumos&quot;) which split and integrate these species throughout the phylogeny of &quot;Sabal.&quot; The largest of the clades identified by Zona, &quot;Clade 3&quot; is disrupted significantly as it is split into multiple clades. Although &quot;Sabal causiarum&quot; and &quot;S. domingensis&quot; retain their relationship as sister species, they are included in a clade that also includes &quot;S. maritima&quot; and &quot;S. rosei.&quot; Despite these disruptions in placement between these two studies, the overall integrity of &quot;Clade 1&quot; and &quot;Clade 2&quot; is in congruence with the clades established from the molecular data.

=== Species ===


===Prehistoric taxa===
Extinct species within this genus include:
* †&quot;Sabal bigbendense&quot; 
* †&quot;Sabal bracknellense&quot; 
* †&quot;Sabal grayana&quot; 
* †&quot;Sabal imperialis&quot; 
* †&quot;Sabal jenkinsii&quot; 
* †&quot;Sabal lamanonis&quot;
* †&quot;Sabal raphipholia&quot;

Plants of the genus lived from the late Cretaceous to the Quaternary period (from 66 million to 12 thousand years ago). Fossils have been found in the United States, as well as in Europe (Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Greece, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, France) and Japan. Leaf fossils of &quot;Sabal lamanonis&quot; have been recovered from rhyodacite tuff of Lower Miocene age in southern Slovakia near the town of Lučenec. 27 million year old &quot;Sabal lamanonis&quot; and &quot;Sabal raphipholia&quot; leaf fossils in volcanic rocks have been described from the Evros region in Western Thrace, Greece.

=== Formerly placed in &quot;Sabal&quot; ===
* &quot;Serenoa repens&quot; (as &quot;S. serrulata&quot; )

== Ecology ==
&quot;Sabal&quot; species are used as food sources by several species of birds (including &quot;Mimus polyglottos, Turdus migratorius, Dendroica coronata, Corvus ossifragus,&quot; and &quot;Drycopus pileatus)&quot; as well as insects, such as &quot;Caryobruchus&quot; and various species of Hymenoptera. American black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus)&quot; and raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor)&quot; are also known to feed on fruit of various species of &quot;Sabal. Sabal palmetto&quot; is recorded to have its own lichen, &quot;Arthonia rubrocincta,&quot; that only occurs on its leaf bases. In Europe, the introduced Lepidopteran species &quot;Paysandisia archon&quot; has become a prominent pest whose larvae are known to feed on some of the cultivated species of &quot;Sabal.&quot;

==Uses==
Arborescent species are often transplanted from natural stands into urban landscapes and are rarely grown in nurseries due to slow growth. Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants and because several species are relatively cold-hardy, can be grown farther north than most other palms. The central bud of &quot;Sabal&quot; &quot;palmetto&quot; is edible and, when cooked, is known as &#x27;swamp cabbage&#x27;. Mature fronds are used as thatch, to make straw hats, and for weaving mats.

<text>In the Hindu tradition, a murti (, ) is a devotional image, such as a statue or icon, of a deity or saint used during &quot;puja&quot; and/or in other customary forms of actively expressing devotion or reverence - whether at Hindu temples or shrines. A &quot;mūrti&quot; is a symbolic icon representing divinity for the purpose of devotional activities. Thus, not all icons of gods and saints are &quot;mūrti&quot;; for example, purely decorative depictions of divine figures often adorn Hindu temple architecture in intricately carved doorframes, on colourfully painted walls, and ornately sculpted rooftop domes. A &quot;mūrti&quot; itself is not God, but it is merely a representative shape, symbolic embodiment, or iconic manifestation of God. 

&quot;Murti&quot; are also found in some nontheistic Jain traditions, where they serve as symbols of revered mortals inside Jain temples, and are worshiped in &quot;murtipujaka&quot; rituals.

A &quot;murti&quot; is typically made by carving stone, wood working, metal casting or through pottery. Ancient era texts describing their proper proportions, positions and gestures include the Puranas, Agamas, and Samhitas. The expressions in a murti vary in diverse Hindu traditions, ranging from &quot;ugra&quot; () symbolism to express destruction, fear, and violence (Durga, Kali) to &quot;saumya&quot; () symbolism to express joy, knowledge, and harmony (Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Ganesha). &quot;Saumya&quot; images are most common in Hindu temples. Other &quot;murti&quot; forms found in Hinduism include the &quot;lingam&quot;.

A &quot;murti&quot; is an embodiment of the divine, the ultimate reality or Brahman, to some Hindus. In a religious context, they are found in Hindu temples or homes, where they may be treated as a beloved guest and serve as a participant of &quot;puja&quot;. On other occasions, they serve as the centre of attention in annual festive processions; these are called &quot;utsava murti&quot;. The earliest &quot;murti&quot; are mentioned by Pāṇini in the 4th century BCE. Prior to that, the &quot;agnicayana&quot; ritual ground seemed to serve as a template for the temple.

A &quot;murti&quot; may also be referred to as a vigraha, pratima or simply deity.

Hindu devotees go to the mandirs to take &quot;darshan,&quot; bringing prepared offerings of &quot;naivedya&quot; to be blessed at the altar before the deity&quot;,&quot; and to perform &quot;puja&quot; and &quot;aarti.&quot;

==Etymology and nomenclature==

&quot;Murti&quot; literally means any solid body or form with a definite shape or limits produced from material elements. It contrasts with the mind, thought, and immaterial in ancient Indian literature. The term also refers to any embodiment, manifestation, incarnation, personification, appearance, image, idol, or statue of a deity.

The earliest mention of the term &quot;murti&quot; occurs in primary Upanishads composed in the 1st millennium BCE, particularly in verse 3.2 of Aitareya Upanishad, verse 1.13 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, verse 6.14 of Maitrayaniya Upanishad and verse 1.5 of Prashna Upanishad. For example, the Maitrayaniya Upanishad uses the term to mean a &quot;form, manifestation of time&quot;. The section sets out to prove Time exists, acknowledges the difficulty in proving Time exists by Pramana (epistemology in Indian philosophy), then inserts a theory of inductive inference for epistemological proof as follows,

The section includes the concept of Time and non-Time, stating that non-Time existed before the creation of the universe, and time came into existence with the creation of the universe. Non-time is indivisible, time is divisible, and the Maitri Upanishad then asserts that the &quot;year is the &quot;mūrti&quot; of time&quot;. Robert Hume translates the discussion of &quot;&quot;mūrti&quot; of time&quot;, in verse 6.14 of the Maitri Upanishad, as &quot;form&quot;.

Western scholarship on Hinduism emphasizes that there was neither murti nor temples nor idol-facilitated worship in the Vedic era. The Vedic Hinduism rituals were directed at nature and abstract deities called during yajna with hymns. However, there isn&#x27;t a universal consensus, with scholars such as AC Das, pointing to the word &quot;Mūradeva&quot; in Rig Veda verses 7.104.24, 10.87.2 and 10.87.14. This word may refer to &quot;Deva who is fixed&quot; or &quot;Deva who is foolish&quot;. The former interpretation, if accurate, may imply that there were communities in the Vedic era who had Deva in the form of murti, and the context of these hymns suggests that the term could be referring to practices of the tribal communities outside of the Vedic fold.

One of the earliest firm textual evidence of Deva images, in the sense of &quot;murti&quot;, is found in &quot;Jivikarthe Capanye&quot; by the Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini who lived about 4th-century BCE. He mentions &quot;Acala&quot; and &quot;Cala&quot;, with former referring to images in a shrine, and the latter meaning images that were carried from place to place. Panini also mentions &quot;Devalaka&quot;, meaning custodians of images of worship who show the images but do not sell them, as well as &quot;Jivika&quot; as people whose source of livelihood was the gifts they received from devotees. In ancient Sanskrit texts that follow Panini&#x27;s work, numerous references are found to divine images with terms such as &quot;Devagrha&quot;, &quot;Devagara&quot;, &quot;Devakula&quot;, &quot;Devayatana&quot; and others. These texts, states Noel Salmond, strongly suggest that temples and murti were in existence in ancient India by about 4th century BCE. Recent archaeological evidence confirms that the knowledge and art of sculpture was established in India by the Maurya Empire period (~3rd century BCE).

By the early 1st millennium BCE, the term &quot;murti&quot; meant idols, images, or statues in various Indian texts such as Bhavishya Purana verse 132.5.7, Brihat Samhita 1.8.29, and inscriptions in different parts of India. The term &quot;murti&quot; has been a more generic term referring to an idol or statue of anyone, either a deity, of any human being, animal or any art. &quot;Pratima&quot; includes murti as well as painting of any non-anthropomorphic object. In contrast, &quot;Bera&quot; or &quot;Bimba&quot; meant &quot;idol of god&quot; only, and &quot;Vigraha&quot; was synonymous with &quot;Bimba&quot;.

==Types==


A &quot;murti&quot; in contemporary usage is any image or statue. It may be found inside or outside a temple or home, installed to be moved with a festive procession (&quot;utsava murti&quot;), or just be a landmark. It is a significant part of Hindu iconography, and is implemented in many ways. Two major categories include:
*&quot;Raudra&quot; or &quot;Ugra&quot; - are images that were meant to terrify, induce fear. These typically have wide, circular eyes, carry weapons, have skulls and bones as adornment. These idols were worshipped by soldiers before going to war, or by people in times of distress or errors. Raudra deity temples were not set up inside villages or towns, but invariably outside and in remote areas of a kingdom.
*&quot;Shanta&quot; and &quot;Saumya&quot; - are images that were pacific, peaceful and expressive of love, compassion, kindness and other virtues in Hindu pantheon. These images would carry symbolic icons of peace, knowledge, music, wealth, flowers, sensuality among other things. In ancient India, these temples were predominant inside villages and towns.

Beyond anthropomorphic forms of religious murti, some traditions of Hinduism cherish aniconism, where alternate symbols are shaped into a murti, such as the linga for Shiva, yoni for Devi, and the saligrama for Vishnu.

==Methods and manuals==


Murti, when produced properly, are made according to the design rules of the Shilpa Shastras. They recommend materials, measurements, proportions, decoration, and symbolism of the murti. Explanation of the metaphysical significance of each stage of manufacture and the prescription of specific mantras to sanctify the process and evoke and invoke the power of the deity in the image are found in the liturgical handbooks the Agamas and Tantras. In Tantric traditions, a murti is installed by priests through the &quot;Prana pratishta&quot; ceremony, where mantras are recited sometimes with yantras (mystic diagrams), whereby state Harold Coward and David Goa, the &quot;divine vital energy of the cosmos is infused into the sculpture&quot; and then the divine is welcomed as one would welcome a friend. The esoteric Hindu tantric traditions through texts such as &quot;Tantra-tattva&quot; follow elaborate rituals to infuse life into a murti. Some tantra texts such as the &quot;Pancaratraraksa&quot; state that anyone who considers an icon of Vishnu as nothing but &quot;an ordinary object&quot; made of iron &quot;goes to hell&quot;. The use of murti and particularly the &quot;prana protist&quot; consecration ceremony, states Buhnemann, has been criticized by Hindu groups. These groups state that this practice came from more recent &quot;false tantra books&quot;, and there is not a single word in the Vedas about such a ceremony.
The artists who make any art or craft, including murti, were known as &quot;shilpins&quot;. The formally trained &quot;Shilpins&quot; shape the murti not following fancy but following canonical manuals such as the Agamas and the Shilpa Shastras texts such as Vishvakarma. The material of construction range from clay to wood to marble to metal alloys such as panchaloha. The sixth century &quot;Brihat Samhita&quot; and eighth-century text &quot;Manasara-Silpasastra&quot; (literally: &quot;treatise on art using the method of measurement&quot;), identify nine materials for murti construction – gold, silver, copper, stone, wood, &quot;Sudha&quot; (a type of stucco, mortar plaster), &quot;sarkara&quot; (gravel, grit), &quot;Bahasa&quot; (marble types), and earth (clay, terracotta). For &quot;Bahasa&quot;, the texts describe working methods for various types of marble, specialized stones, colors, and a range of opacity (transparent, translucent and crystal).

&quot;Brihat Samhita&quot;, a 6th-century encyclopedia of a range of topics from horticulture to astrology to gemology to murti and temple design, specifies in Chapter 56 that the &quot;pratima&quot; (murti) height should be formula_1 of the sanctum sanctorum&#x27;s door height, the &quot;Pratima&quot; height and the sanctum sanctorum room&#x27;s width be in the ratio of 0.292, it stands on a pedestal that is 0.146 of sanctum room width, thereafter the text describes 20 types of temples with their dimensions. Chapter 58 of the text describes the ratios of various anatomical parts of a murti, from head to toe, along with the recommendation in verse 59.29 that generally accepted variations in dress, decoration, and dimensions of local regional traditions for the murti are the artistic tradition.

The texts recommend materials of construction, proportions, postures, and mudra, symbolic items the murti holds in its hands, colors, garments, and ornaments to go with the murti of each god or goddess, vehicles of deities such as Garuda, bull and lion, and other details. The texts also include chapters on the design of Jaina and Buddhist murti, as well as reliefs of sages, apsaras, different types of devotees (based on bhakti yoga, jnana yoga, karma yoga, ascetics) to decorate the area near the murti. The texts recommend that the material of construction and relative scale of murti be correlated to the scale of the temple dimensions, using twelve types of comparative measurements. Neither the Hybrid Sanskrit of Mahayana Buddhism, nor the Pali of Theravada Buddhism has the word &#x27;murti&#x27;. PK Acharya imputed the Hinduïstic word murti on Buddhist iconography, in which he erred.

In Southern India, the material used predominantly for murti is black granite, while the material in North India is white marble. However, for some Hindus, it is not the materials used that matter, but the faith and meditation on the universal Absolute Brahman. More particularly, devotees meditate or worship on the formless God (nirguna Brahman) through murti symbolism of God (saguna Brahman) during a puja before a murti, or the meditation on a Tirthankara in the case of Jainism, thus making the material of construction or the specific shape of the murti not spiritually important.

According to John Keay, &quot;Only after achieving remarkable expertise in the portrayal of the Buddha figure and of animal and human, did Indian stonemasons turn to produce images of the orthodox &#x27;Hindu&#x27; deities&quot;. This view, however, is not shared by other scholars. Trudy King et al. state that stone images of reverential figures and guardian spirits (&quot;yaksha&quot;) were first produced in Jainism and Hinduism, by about 2 century BCE, as suggested by Mathura region excavations, and this knowledge grew into iconographic traditions and stone monuments in India including those for Buddhism. Neither the Hybrid Sanskrit of Mahayana Buddhism, nor the Pali of Theravada Buddhism has the word &#x27;murti&#x27;.

== Role in worship ==

Major Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartaism favour the use of murti. These traditions suggest that it is easier to dedicate time and focus on spirituality through anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic icons. Hindu scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita, states in verse 12.5,

In Hinduism, a murti itself is not god, it is an image of god and thus a symbol and representation. A murti is a form and manifestation of the formless Absolute. Thus a literal translation of &quot;murti&quot; as &#x27;idol&#x27; is incorrect, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a &quot;murti&quot; is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer. When a person worships a murti, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper&#x27;s spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality or Brahman is not confined in it.Devotional (&quot;bhakti movement&quot;) practices centered on cultivating a deep and personal bond of love with God, often expressed and facilitated with one or more murti, and includes individual or community hymns, japa or singing (&quot;bhajan&quot;, &quot;kirtan&quot; or &quot;aarti&quot;). Acts of devotion, in major temples particularly, are structured on treating the murti as the manifestation of a revered guest, and the daily routine can include awakening the murti in the morning and making sure that it &quot;is washed, dressed, and garlanded.&quot; In Vaishnavism, the building of a temple for the murti is considered an act of devotion, but non-murti symbolism is also common wherein the aromatic tulsi plant or &quot;Saligrama&quot; is an aniconic reminder of the spiritualism in Vishnu. These puja rituals with the murti correspond to ancient cultural practices for a beloved guest, and the murti is welcomed, taken care of, and then requested to retire.

An image in Hinduism cannot be equated with a deity and the object of worship is the divine whose power is inside the image, and the image is not the object of worship itself, Hindus believe everything is worthy of worship as it contains divine energy emanating from the one god. According to the Agamas, the &quot;bimba murti&quot; ( / ) is different from the &quot;mantra murti&quot; () from the perspective of rituals, gestures, hymns and offerings.

Some Hindu denominations like Arya Samaj and Satya Mahima Dharma reject idol worship.

=== Modes of worshipping ===
Worship of a &quot;murti&quot; involves various modes and rituals. Before a &quot;murti&quot; is worshipped, a ritual known as &quot;prana pratishta&quot; is conducted. This ritual is performed to invoke the presence of the god or goddess into the physical form of the murti. In temples, this ceremony is a one-time event for a specific &quot;murti&quot;. In domestic rituals, the deity is invited to reside in the murti through &quot;avahana&quot; (invocation) each time a puja is conducted and then dispersed back at the end of the puja. Adorning a &quot;murti&quot; is mode that allows devotees to express love for the deity and visually and experientially connect with the nature of the god or goddess. In worship at a temple, the significant moment is when the adorned &quot;murti&quot; is revealed, and worshippers take darshan by witnessing the fully adorned &quot;murti&quot;.

==Role in history==

&quot;Murti&quot; and temples were well established in South Asia, before the start of Delhi Sultanate in the late 12th century CE. They became a target of destruction during raids and religious wars between Islam and Hinduism through the 18th century.

During the colonial era, Christian missionaries aiming to convert Hindus to Christianity wrote memoirs and books that were widely distributed in Europe, which Mitter, Pennington, and other scholars call fictionalized stereotypes, where &quot;murti&quot; were claimed as the evidence of lack of spiritual heritage in primitive Hindus, of &quot;idolatry and savage worship of stones&quot;, practices akin to Biblical demons, calling &quot;murti&quot; monstrous devils or eroticized bizarre beings carved in stone. The British Missionary Society with colonial government&#x27;s assistance bought and sometimes seized, then transferred &quot;murti&quot; from India and displayed it in their &quot;trophies&quot; room in the United Kingdom with the note claiming that these were given up by Hindus who now accept the &quot;folly and sin of idolatry&quot;. In other instances, the colonial British authorities, seeking additional government revenue, introduced Pilgrim Tax on Hindus to view &quot;murti&quot; inside major temples.

The missionaries and orientalist scholars attempted to justify the need for colonial rule of India by attacking &quot;murti&quot; as a symbol of depravity and primitiveness, arguing that it was, states Tanisha Ramachandran, &quot;the White Man&#x27;s Burden to create a moral society&quot; in India. This literature by the Christian missionaries constructed the foundation of a &quot;Hindu image&quot; in Europe, during the colonial era, and it blamed &quot;murti&quot; idolatry as &quot;the cause for the ills of Indian society&quot;. By 19th-century, ideas such as pantheism (the universe is identical with God or Brahman), contained in newly translated Sanskrit texts were linked to the idolatry of &quot;murti&quot; and declared as additional evidence of superstitions and evil by Christian missionaries and colonial authorities in British India.

The polemics of Christian missionaries in colonial India triggered a debate among Hindus, yielding divergent responses. It ranged from activists such as Dayananda Saraswati who denounced all &quot;murti&quot;, to Vivekananda who refused to denounce &quot;murti&quot; and asked Hindus in India and Christians in the West to introspect, that images are used everywhere to help think and as a road to ideas, in the following words,

Religious intolerance and polemics, state Halbertal and Margalit, have historically targeted idols and material symbols cherished by other religions, while encouraging the worship of material symbols of one&#x27;s religion, characterizing the material symbols of others as grotesque and wrong, in some cases dehumanizing the others and encouraging the destruction of idols of the others. The outsider conflates and stereotypes the &quot;strange worship&quot; of the other religions as &quot;false worship&quot; first, then calls &quot;false worship&quot; as &quot;improper worship and false belief&quot; of pagan or an equivalent term, thereafter constructing an identity of the others as &quot;primitive and barbarians&quot; that need to be saved, followed by justified intolerance and often violence against those who cherish a different material symbol than one&#x27;s own. In the history of Hinduism and India, states Pennington, Hindu deity images (&quot;murti&quot;) have been a religious lens for focusing this anti-Hindu polemic and was the basis for distortions, accusations and attacks by non-Indian religious powers and missionaries.

==Significance==
Ancient Indian texts assert the significance of murti in spiritual terms. The &quot;Vāstusūtra Upaniṣad&quot;, whose palm-leaf manuscripts were discovered in the 1970s among remote villages of Orissa – four in Oriya language and one in crude Sanskrit, asserts that the doctrine of murti art making is founded on the principles of origin and evolution of universe, is a &quot;form of every form of cosmic creator&quot; that empirically exists in nature, and it functions to inspire a devotee towards contemplating the Ultimate Supreme Principle (Brahman). This text, whose composition date is unknown but probably from late 1st millennium CE, discusses the significance of images as, state Alice Boner and others, &quot;inspiring, elevating and purifying influence&quot; on the viewer and &quot;means of communicating a vision of supreme truth and for giving a taste of the infinite that lies beyond&quot;. It adds (abridged):

In the fifth chapter of Vāstusūtra Upaniṣad, Pippalada asserts, &quot;from tattva-rupa (essence of a form, underlying principle) come the &quot;pratirupani&quot; [images]&quot;. In the sixth chapter, Pippalada repeats his message that the artist portrays the particular and universal concepts, with the statement &quot;the work of the &quot;Sthapaka&quot; is a creation similar to that of the Prajapati&quot; (that which created the universe). Non-theistic Jaina scholars such as Jnansundar, states John Cort, have argued the significance of murti along the same lines, asserting that &quot;no matter what the field – scientific, commercial, religious – there can be no knowledge without an icon&quot;, images are part of how human beings learn and focus their thoughts, icons are necessary and inseparable from spiritual endeavors in Jainism.While &quot;murti&quot; are an easily and commonly visible aspect of Hinduism, they are not necessary for Hindu worship. Among Hindus, states Gopinath Rao, one who has realized Self (Soul, Atman) and the Universal Principle (Brahman, god) within himself, there is no need for any temple or divine image for worship. For those who have yet to reach this height of realization, various symbolic manifestations through images, idols, and icons as well as mental modes of worship are offered as one of the spiritual paths in the Hindu way of life. This belief is repeated in ancient Hindu scriptures. For example, the Jabaladarshana Upanishad states:

<doc id="571731" wikidata="Q212475" url="?curid=571731" title="Visconti of Milan">
<text>The Visconti of Milan are a noble Italian family. They rose to power in Milan during the Middle Ages where they ruled from 1277 to 1447, initially as Lords then as Dukes, and several collateral branches still exist. The effective founder of the Visconti Lordship of Milan was the Archbishop Ottone, who wrested control of the city from the rival Della Torre family in 1277.

==Origins==
The earliest members of the Visconti lineage appeared in Milan in the second half of the 11th century. The first evidence is on October 5, 1075, when Ariprando Visconti and his son Ottone (&quot;Ariprandus Vicecomes&quot;, &quot;Otto Vicecomes filius Ariprandi&quot;) attended and signed together some legal documents in Milan. Ariprando Visconti&#x27;s family is believed to have pre-existed in Milan and obtained the title of viscount, which became hereditary throughout the male descent.

In the years following 1075, Ottone Visconti is shown in the proximity of the Salian dynasty&#x27;s sovereigns, Henry IV and his son Conrad. His death&#x27;s circumstances confirm the relationship with the imperial family. In 1111 in Rome, Ottone was captured and executed after attempting to defend Henry V from an assault. In the first documents where they appear, Ottone and his offspring declared that they abided by the Lombard law and acted in connection with other Milanese families of the noble upper class (&quot;capitanei&quot;). A relationship with the Litta, a Milanese vavasour family subordinate to the Visconti in the feudal hierarchy, is also documented. These circumstances demonstrate their participation in the Milanese society in the years before 1075 and, ultimately, their Lombard origin.

In 1134, Guido Visconti, son of Ottone, received from the abbot of Saint Gall the investiture of the court of Massino, a strategic location on the hills above Lake Maggiore, near Arona. Here, another family member was present in the second half of the 12th century as the castellan (&quot;custos&quot;) of the local archiepiscopal fortress. In 1142, King Conrad III confirmed the investiture in a diploma released to Guido in Ulm. Another royal document, issued by Conrad III in 1142 as well, attests to the Visconti&#x27;s entitlement to the  in Albusciago and Besnate. Based on a document issued in 1157, the Visconti were considered holders of the captaincy of Marliano (today Mariano Comense) since the time of archbishop Landulf; however, the available documentation cannot infer such a conclusion.

A second Ottone, son of Guido, is attested in the documentary sources between 1134 and 1192. The primary role of Ottone in the political life of the Milanese commune emerges in the period of the confrontation with Frederick Barbarossa: his name is the first to be cited, March 1, 1162, in the group of Milanese leaders who surrendered to the emperor after the capitulation of the city that took place in the previous weeks. A member of the following generation, Ariprando, was bishop of Vercelli between 1208 and 1213 when he also played the role of Papal legate for Innocent III. An attempt to have him elected archbishop of Milan failed in 1212 amidst growing tensions between opposite factions inside the city. His death in 1213, was probably caused by poisoning.

The family dispersed into several branches, some of which obtained fiefs far off from Milan. Among them, the one that gave origin to the lords and dukes of Milan allegedly descended from Uberto, who died in the first half of the 13th century. The other branches&#x27; members frequently added to their surname the name of the place where they chose to live and where a fortification was available for their residence. The first of such cases were the Visconti di Massino, the Visconti di Invorio, and the Visconti di Oleggio Castello. In these localities, a castle (Massino), its remains (Invorio), or a later reconstruction of the initial building (Oleggio Castello) are still visible today.

==Lords and Dukes of Milan==
The Visconti ruled Milan until the early Renaissance, first as Lords, then, from 1395, with the mighty Gian Galeazzo, who endeavored to unify Northern and Central Italy, as Dukes. Visconti&#x27;s rule in Milan ended with the death of Filippo Maria Visconti in 1447. He was succeeded by a short-lived republic and then by his son-in-law Francesco I Sforza, who established the reign of the House of Sforza.

===Rise to the lordship===
When Frederick II died in 1250, the war engaged by the Lombard League and Milan against him ended. Inside the Milanese commune, united in its defense until then, conflicts between rival factions began. The Della Torre family progressively acquired power in Milan after 1240, when Pagano Della Torre assumed the leadership of the Credenza di Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, a political party with a popular base. This position allowed them to have a role in the tax collection of the commune (estimo), which was essential to finance the war against Frederick II while affecting the great landowners. In 1247, Pagano was succeeded by his nephew Martino Della Torre. The commune created the new role of Senior of the Credenza (Anziano della Credenza) for him to underline his authority. In this position, the Della Torre began to clash with the Milanese noble families organized in their political party, the Societas Capitaneorum et Valvassorum, having the Visconti among the most prominent figures. After unrest between the opposite parties, the so-called Sant&#x27;Ambrogio Peace was signed in 1258 among the parties, strengthening the position of La Credenza and La Motta (a second political party with popular tendencies).

New events in favor of the Della Torre undermined the Sant&#x27;Ambrogio Peace. At the end of 1259, Oberto Pallavicino, a former partisan of Frederick II who got closer to the Guelph positions of the Della Torre, was appointed by the Milanese commune for five years as General Captain of the People. His victory in the Battle of Cassano on 16 September 1259 against Ezzelino da Romano, formerly his ally on the Ghibelline side in the war of Frederick II against the Lombard communes, enhanced his position in Milan. The nobles expelled from the city during the clashes preceding the Sant&#x27;Ambrogio Peace placed their hopes on Ezzelino to regain their old power.

A decisive event in the confrontation between the Della Torre and the Visconti factions was the appointment of Ottone Visconti as archbishop of Milan in 1262. Pope Urban IV preferred Ottone to Raimondo, another candidate from the Della Torre family. Prevented from assuming his office and forced by the opposite faction to remain outside the city, Ottone settled in Arona, a town at the Milanese archdiocese&#x27;s border. At the end of 1263, Della Torre forces, with the support of Oberto Pallavicino, dislodged him from Arona. Ottone sought refuge in central Italy near the pope.

In 1264, Pallavicino left his office, leaving the Della Torre family members as the sole rulers of Milan. Under the guidance of Filippo Della Torre, brother of Martino and his successor after 1263, the Della Torre party took advantage of the favor of Charles of Anjou. Milan allied with him and other northern Italian cities (Guelph League) to fight the Hohenstaufen rule in southern Italy. Francesco Della Torre led the Milanese expedition, which ended in 1266 with the defeat of Manfred of Sicily, son of Frederick II, in the Battle of Benevento. Charles of Anjou became the new King of Sicily, having an indirect rule (exercised through the Della Torre) on Milan.

In 1266, trying to take advantage of the favorable moment, the Della Torre advocated their cause against the Visconti in a consistory held by Pope Clement IV in Viterbo and attended by archbishop Ottone. Despite the presence of a delegate of Charles of Anjou, the pope&#x27;s decision was in Ottone&#x27;s favor. The pope then attempted to appease the two factions through an oath of allegiance demanded from the Milanese population. Part of it was the acceptance of Ottone as archbishop. However, new circumstances again changed the events in favor of Della Torre. At the end of 1266, the German princes decided to support Conradin, the last Hohenstaufen member, to recover the domains in southern Italy lost to the Anjou house after the defeat of Benevento. This move again reinstated Della Torre as leader of the Guelph League. Moreover, in 1268, Clement IV died, initiating a period of papal vacancy that left the dispositions in favor of Ottone without practical consequences.

The defeat and execution of Conradin in Naples in 1268 meant the definitive end of the Hohenstaufen threat to Milan. Then, the confrontation between the two Milanese factions resumed and increasingly assumed a military connotation. A leading figure on the Visconti side was Simone Orelli da Locarno, whose military ability became legendary during the wars against Fredrick II. Notwithstanding this, being in favor of the Visconti, he was arrested in 1263 and jailed in Milan. In 1276, he was freed in the context of a compromise between the two factions about Como, and after he promised not to act against Della Torre. He joined the Visconti army altogether, assuming the role of General Captain. The Visconti forces gained ground in the Lake Maggiore&#x27;s area, but in the same year, Tebaldo Visconti, nephew of Ottone, was captured with other leading figures. Brought to Gallarate, they were executed by beheading. The Visconti defeated the Della Torre army in the decisive Battle of Desio on 21 January 1277, opening the way for Ottone to enter Milan. Napoleone, son of Pagano, was arrested with other Della Torre family members. He died in jail a few months later. These events mark the foundation of the Visconti lordship of Milan.

Ottone initially granted power in Milan to Simone Orelli, appointing him Captain of the People. In 1287, he transferred this role to his grandnephew Matteo Visconti (the son of Tebaldo executed in 1276). One year later, Matteo obtained the title of Imperial vicar from the emperor Rudolf of Habsburg. Ottone died in 1295, leaving Matteo as the new Lord of Milan. In 1302, the Della Torre retook power, forcing Matteo to leave the city. In 1311, Emperor Henry VII appeased the dispute between the two families and restored Matteo&#x27;s lordship. After him, seven members of his offspring, along four generations, ruled over Milan and a growing territory in northern and central Italy.

===Rulers and their families===
====Matteo, Galeazzo, Azzone, Luchino, and Giovanni (1311–1354)====
The reconciliation agreement with the Della Torre family, reached in December 1310 on the initiative of Henry VII, was attended by Matteo, his brother Uberto, and their cousin Ludovico, also known as Lodrisio. Matteo acted alone as Lord of Milan in the following years. He ruled for about eleven years, providing to his family the legal basis for the hereditary lordship over Milan and extending the territory under the Milanese influence against the traditional opponents of the Visconti: the Della Torre and Anjou dynasties allied with the Papacy. After being accused of necromancy and heresy, he was convicted by the Church. Looking for a reconciliation, he transferred the power to his eldest son Galeazzo and left Milan for the Augustinian monastery of Crescenzago, where he died in 1322.

After Matteo&#x27;s death, Galeazzo associated his brothers, Marco, Luchino, Stefano, and Giovanni (a cleric), in the inherited domains&#x27; controls. He died five years later, succeeded by his son Azzone, who ruled between 1329 and 1339. Stefano married Valentina Doria from Genoa and died in 1327 under unclear circumstances. He left three sons: Matteo (Matteo II), Bernabò, and Galeazzo (Galeazzo II). Marco felt in disgrace and was killed by hitmen in 1329

During Azzone&#x27;s rule, Lodrisio (the cousin of Matteo, who in 1310 attended the reconciliation with the Della Torre) raised against him, trying to revert the line of succession in favor of his own family. He obtained the support of the Della Scala family of Verona. However, in the Battle of Parabiago, 1339, he was defeated by an army led by Azzone and backed by his uncles, Luchino and Giovanni. Azzone died in 1339 without sons, and the power passed to Luchino and Giovanni (since 1342, archbishop of Milan). In the years of their rule, Matteo II, Bernabò, and Galeazzo II were suspected of conspiring against Luchino. Threatened by him, they left Milan.

After Luchino died in 1349, archbishop Giovanni remained alone in power and recalled Matteo II, Bernabò, and Galeazzo II in Milan. Under his rule, the territorial expansion continued (to Genoa and Bologna) thanks to his diplomacy. Part of his initiatives were the marriages of his nephews to members of the nearby noble dynasties of northern Italy: in 1340, Matteo II to Egidiola Gonzaga; in 1350, Bernabò to Regina Della Scala and Galeazzo II to Bianca of Savoy. In 1353, Petrarch accepted an invitation from Giovanni and moved to Milan, where he lived until 1361. He took part in Visconti&#x27;s diplomatic initiatives and provided first-hand accounts of his life in Milan and Visconti&#x27;s family events in his letters.

====Joint lordship of Matteo II, Bernabò, and Galeazzo II (1354–1385)====
On 5 October 1354, archbishop Giovanni died. A few days later, Petrarch held a commemorative oration in his honor. In the same month, Matteo II, Bernabò, and Galeazzo II agreed to share the power, dividing the Visconti domains according to geographic criteria. Matteo II died the following year, and Bernabò and Galeazzo II divided his territory between them. The two brothers settled their courts separately: Bernabò in Milan and Galeazzo II in Pavia. Bernabò and Galeazzo II extended the Visconti relationships to several European noble dynasties through their children&#x27;s marriages.

In 1360, Gian Galeazzo, son of Galeazzo II, married Isabelle of Valois, daughter of King John II of France. The marriage was the result of negotiation, also participated by Petrarch with a journey to Paris, leading the Visconti to contribute 600,000 francs to the ransom paid by France to England to obtain the freedom of the King in an episode of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Violante, daughter of Galeazzo II, married in 1368 Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, the third son of King Edward III of England. After her husband&#x27;s death, only a few months after the marriage, in 1377, Violante married Secondotto, Marquess of Montferrat. Again widowed, in 1381, she married her cousin Lodovico, one of the sons of Bernabò.

Bernabò and his wife, Regina Della Scala, had 15 children. Nine daughters (Taddea, Viridis, Valentina, Agnese, Antonia, Maddalena, Anglesia, Elisabetta, Lucia) married scions of other European dynasties, connecting the Visconti to the houses of Wittelsbach (Taddea, Maddalena, Elisabetta), Habsburg (Viridis), Poitiers-Lusignan (Valentina, Anglesia), Württemberg (Antonia), Gonzaga (Agnese), Holland (Lucia). Their sons Marco and Carlo married Elisabeth of Bavaria and Beatrice of Armagnac, respectively. Caterina, another daughter of Bernabò, married in 1380 her cousin Gian Galeazzo, widow of Isabelle of Valois, who died in 1372 in Pavia while giving birth to her fourth child.

When Galeazzo II died in 1378, his son Gian Galeazzo was the only heir of his half of the Visconti territories. Bernabò, 28 years older than his nephew, tended to assume a leading role towards him. The two Visconti had different personalities and ruling styles: instinctive, bad-tempered, and establisher of a terror regime, Bernabò; circumspect and relatively mild to his subjects, Gian Galeazzo. In the following years, the relationship between the two Visconti progressively deteriorated.

A few months after the death of his wife and counselor, Bernabò was deposed by his nephew in a coup, probably prepared for years and kept secret. On 5 May 1385, accompanied by his generals (Jacopo dal Verme, Antonio Porro, and Guglielmo Bevilacqua) and with a heavily armed escort, Gian Galeazzo moved from Pavia for an apparent pilgrimage journey to Santa Maria del Monte di Velate near Varese. The following day, passing by Milan, he arranged to meet Bernabò for what was expected to be a familiar greeting. Bernabò, unprotected, was intercepted and arrested. The coup also led to the arrest of two sons of Bernabò, who were accompanying him. The people in the domains of Bernabò, firstly the Milanese, promptly submitted to Gian Galeazzo, an attitude widely attributed to their desire to abandon the ruthless regime under which they had been living. Incarcerated in his own castle at Trezzo sull&#x27;Adda, Bernabò died a few months later after being given a poisoned meal.

====Gian Galeazzo, sole ruler and Duke of Milan (1385–1402)====
The death of Bernabò left Gian Galeazzo as the sole ruler of the Visconti territories. The two sons of Bernabò arrested with him (Ludovico and Rodolfo) spent the rest of their lives in jail. The two still free (Carlo and Mastino) lived far from Milan and never posed a threat to Gian Galeazzo. Only the Della Scala in Verona, their mother&#x27;s family, continued to support them. After reaching some agreement with their cousin, they ended their lives in exile in Bavaria and Venice. The three unmarried daughters of Bernabò (Anglesia, Elisabetta, Lucia) moved to Pavia. They lived there under the care of their sister Caterina, the second wife of Gian Galeazzo, until their wedding.

For his court, Gian Galeazzo preferred Pavia to Milan. There, he continued to develop the castle&#x27;s renowned library and support the local university. His daughter Valentina revived the relationship with the French royal family, interrupted by his first wife Isabelle&#x27;s death. She married in 1389 Louis I, Duke of Orléans, brother of Charles VI, King of France. The three sons of Gian Galeazzo and Isabelle died before reaching adulthood.

Gian Galeazzo and Caterina had two sons: Giovanni Maria in 1388 and Filippo Maria in 1392. In 1395, for 100,000 florins, Gian Galeazzo obtained the Duke of Milan&#x27;s title from the King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia. During his rule, the Visconti territories reached their broadest extension in northern and central Italy. Among the previous domains, only Genoa, ruled by archbishop Giovanni, remained excluded. After a short disease, the plague or gout, Gian Galeazzo died on 3 September 1402.

====Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria (1402–1447)====
The unexpected death of Gian Galeazzo caused severe difficulty for the Visconti court. The news of his end was initially kept secret, and the funeral was delayed until 20 October 1402. The two sons, only 12 and 10 years old, remained under the care of their mother, Caterina, who acted as Regent according to Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s last will. A Council of Regency supporting Caterina was set up, but contrasts soon emerged inside it. Moreover, some members of Visconti&#x27;s collateral branches and two of Bernabò&#x27;s illegitimate sons opposed Caterina&#x27;s regency, using circumstances to gain power. In 1404, Giovanni Maria became the new Duke of Milan. Ruling under the influence of his mother&#x27;s opposers, he induced her to leave Milan for Monza. There, on 17 October 1404, she died in unclear circumstances.

During the rule of Giovanni Maria, the political crisis deteriorated. Facino Cane, one of Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s generals, obtained the title of Count of Biandrate and gained considerable authority in the Visconti territories. Other local forces emerged, leading to the fragmentation of territorial unity. Nearby powers conquered peripheral regions. This situation ended in 1412 when Facino Cane died, and a conspiracy against Giovanni Maria led to his assassination. In the same year, his brother Filippo Maria married the widow of Facino Cane, the 42-year-old Beatrice of Tenda, taking advantage of a testamentary disposition in favor of any Visconti that would have married her. The marriage ended with the accusation of adultery against Beatrice, her incarceration, and the sentence to death carried out in the Binasco castle in 1418.

In 1428, Filippo Maria married Mary of Savoy, but they had no sons. In 1425, his mistress Agnese Del Maino gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, Bianca Maria. Considered by his father his only heir, she grew up with her mother in the Abbiategrasso and Cusago castles. In 1432, Bianca Maria was betrothed to Francesco Sforza, a condottiero of Filippo Maria. In 1441 she married him, granting him the succession to the Duchy of Milan. A sign of their marriage is visible today in the twin churches of Santa Maria Incoronata in Milan.

====The heirs of Bianca Maria and Valentina, dukes of Milan (1450–1535) ====
After the death of Filippo Maria in 1447 and the short-lived Ambrosian Republic in 1447–1450, Francesco Sforza became the new Duke of Milan. Bianca Maria and her husband initiated a new dynasty that ruled Milan discontinuously until 1535.

When Louis XII of France entered Milan in 1499 after the First Italian War, he leveraged a clause of the marriage contract of his grandmother Valentina, the daughter of Gian Galeazzo, to assume the title of Duke of Milan. After his death and the short rule of Maximilian Sforza (1512–1515), Francis I, heir of Valentina as well, inherited the Duchy. After an Imperial-Spanish army defeated France in the Battle of Pavia in 1525, a Sforza, Francesco II, assumed rule in Milan again. His death and a new war led the Duchy of Milan into the hands of Philip II of Spain, ending the line of succession initiated by Ottone and Matteo Visconti.

===Political developments and territorial hegemony of Milan===
Under the rule of the Visconti, the government of the city of Milan underwent profound transformations while its territorial hegemony greatly extended, to suffer a crisis after the death of Gian Galeazzo.

The lordship of Ottone and Matteo brought to an end the confrontation between noble and popular parties, which had assumed growing violent forms in Milan during the 13th century. The new power of the Visconti initially relied on the combined roles of Archbishop (Ottone) and Captain of the People, along with the authority deriving from the title of Imperial Vicar (Matteo). After Matteo, the rule in the city assumed hereditary nature inside his family, making any formal recognition by the communal institutions unnecessary. The first Visconti claimed an absolute power (&quot;plenitudo potestatis&quot;) comparable to the one preserved to pope and emperor, culminating with Bernabò, who openly considered their authorities irrelevant in his dominions. The political change in Milan was part of the general decline of the Commune and the subsequent rise of the Signoria that affected northern and central Italy during 13th and 14th centuries.

The annexation of the properties of the Milanese church, which included fortifications like the Angera and Arona castles guarding Lake Maggiore&#x27;s navigation, was the first step Matteo Visconti took to consolidate his power in the territory of the Milanese diocese. That takeover originated a conflict with the Papacy that lasted the following decades. The expansion of the Visconti rule outside the Milanese diocese took advantage of the traditional importance of Milan in northern Italy, reinforced by the leading role played in the Lombard League during the wars against the Hohenstaufen emperors. After the destructions inflicted by Frederick Barbarossa in 1162, in a few years the Milanese reconstructed their city and defeated the emperor at Legnano in 1176, forcing him to the Peace of Constance, which granted autonomy also to the cities allied to Milan. The war was resumed against Frederick II and his successors, eventually leading to the end of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. Based on this favorable position, after the death of Henry VII in 1313, Matteo and his son Galeazzo managed to become lords of other cities in northern Italy: Bergamo, Tortona, Alessandria, Vercelli, and Piacenza. Regimes favoring the Visconti settled in Como, Novara, and Pavia. During this first expansion phase, the Visconti continued to face the opposition of the Guelph League: the Papacy, the Anjou house (sovereigns in southern Italy), and the Della Torre family.

After a crisis suffered during the years of Galeazzo I, the expansion continued under the lordship of Azzone with the military support of his uncle Luchino. In 1334 Cremona surrendered to Azzone. In 1337 Luchino entered Brescia, allowing Azzone to become Lord of the city. In 1339 Azzone and Luchino defeated in the Battle of Parabiago an army formed by their cousin Lodrisio Visconti and the Della Scala family, lords of Verona. In 1341, Luchino obtained a reconciliation with the Church. In 1346 Luchino took Parma, and in 1347 he extended the western border of the Visconti dominions along a stretch of land until Mondovì and Cuneo, at the foot of the Western Alps.

After the death of Luchino, archbishop Giovanni further extended the territories under Milanese control. In 1350 he obtained Bologna from the Pepoli family, and in 1353 he accepted the lordship of Genoa. Through the marriages of his nephews (Matteo II, Bernabò, and Galeazzo II), he linked the Visconti dynastically to the families ruling the territories to the west and east of the Visconti dominions: the Gonzaga, the Della Scala, and the Savoy. The acquisition of Bologna, a city belonging to the territory of the Papal States, reopened the conflict with the pope. In 1352, negotiation with the papal envoy, the abbot Guillaume de Grimoard (later Pope Urban V), led to an agreement that allowed Giovanni to continue to rule Bologna as the papal vicar.

Archbishop Giovanni&#x27;s death in 1354 and the power transfer to Bernabò and Galeazzo II were followed by a reaction in Genoa and Bologna. In 1356 Genoa regained its independence. In Bologna, the rebellion of Giovanni Visconti di Oleggio, a former protégée of Archbishop Giovanni and his lieutenant in the city, opened the way to the intervention of Cardinal Albornoz, who in 1360 brought back the city within the Papal States. Bernabò, the ruler of the eastern portion of the Visconti dominions, repeatedly tried to recover Bologna. This, among other disputes with the Church, cost him a sentence of excommunication by Pope Innocent VI. After his defeat in the Battle of San Ruffillo in 1361, Bernabò finally came to terms with the loss of Bologna. Bernabò and Galeazzo II engaged in bitter clashes also with the imperial authority. After the marquess of Monferrato was appointed imperial vicar in Pavia by Charles IV, the relationship between the emperor and the Visconti deteriorated. In November 1356, in the Battle of Casorate, Visconti forces under the command of Lodrisio Visconti (now reconciled with his cousins) defeated an imperial army and captured its commander, Marquard of Randeck. In 1359, Pavia surrendered to Galeazzo II. His decision to erect a vast castle in Pavia for his family and court was a sign of his ambition to extend Visconti&#x27;s dominions to the area of the ancient Lombard Kingdom.

In the 1370s, Bernabò and Galeazzo II emerged without severe consequences from manifold simultaneous attacks. The two brothers were deprived by the emperor of their vicariate and condemned by Pope Gregory XI as heretics. They subsequently suffered military incursions from the eastern border (by the count of Savoy) and from Bologna (by Papal-Florentine forces), which ended without significant impacts. Peace with the pope and reconciliation with the count of Savoy followed while Florence turned against the pope in a new war. The extension of their matrimonial policies also marked Bernabò and Galeazzo II&#x27;s years. The marriages of their daughters and sons connected the Visconti to the elite of the European aristocracy: the French and English royal houses and several German princely families.

The ineffectiveness of the policies of both Empire and Papacy against the Visconti and the absence of internal conflicts that followed the arrest of Bernabò in 1385 encouraged Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s expansion policy. Military and diplomatic initiatives were continuously taken and personally conducted by Gian Galeazzo from his castle in Pavia. A military campaign between 1386 and 1388 ended with the conquest of the Della Scala and Da Carrara territories of Verona and Padua. Between 1390 and 1398, the attacks of Gian Galeazzo encountered the opposition of the local powers of northern and central Italy; wars against Florence and Mantua were ineffective and even led to the loss of Padua. In 1399, without the use of force, Gian Galeazzo took possession of Pisa and Siena, followed by Perugia in 1400. In July 1402, after the victory in the Battle of Casalecchio against a Bolognese-Florentine army, he assumed the rule of Bologna. His sudden death in September 1402 prevented his long-foreseen attack on Florence.

Gian Galeazzo accompanied the territorial expansion with reforms of the administration (creation of the Consiglio Segreto and the Consiglio di Giustizia), revenues (Maestri Delle Entrate) and criminal justice (Capitano di Giustizia). His promotion to the rank of Duke transformed Milan&#x27;s territory (between Ticino and the Adda rivers) into a duchy. The deep crisis that resulted after the death of Gian Galeazzo is attributed to the lack of time required to secure power in the rapidly growing dominions. The territorial unity of the Visconti state was heavily affected, and the Council of Regency, created to overcome the young age of Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s sons, could not stem the dividing forces that resurfaced, causing the collapse of the system of government built by him. Filippo Maria restored the basis of the Visconti state, and the marriage of his daughter Bianca Maria to Francesco Sforza paved the way to a renewed strong government. In the course of the 15th century, however, the territory under Milanese control narrowed to the Duchy of Milan and later never regained the extension reached under the Visconti rule. In the 16th century, the absolute power established by the Visconti ended with Francesco II, the last Sforza duke.

==Cadet branches==
Family branches have been continually arising since the appearance in Milan of the surname Visconti in the year 1075.

During the first generations, the firstborn among brothers is supposed to have received the role of the most distinguished member of the house. The family of Archbishop Ottone and his grandnephew Matteo, first lords of Milan in the second half of the 13th century, are accordingly considered the descendants of the first Ariprando Visconti along an agnatic primogeniture line over about two centuries. The younger brothers gave origin to cadet branches that continued to live in Milan, participating in the political life of the Milanese Commune.

===Vergante branches (since the 12th century)===
In 1134, Guido Visconti (one of the members of the primogeniture line) obtained from the abbot of Saint Gall the castle of Massino located in the Vergante region on the hills overlooking Lake Maggiore.

The firstborn of Guido Visconti, Ottone, is attested in Milan in the second half of the 12th century with prominent roles in the public life of the Milanese commune. His other descendants initiated to live in the Vergante, originating the cadet branches of the Visconti di Massino, the Visconti di Invorio, and the Visconti di Oleggio Castello. To the Visconti di Massino belonged Uberto Pico, who happened to be confused with Uberto Visconti, the brother of Matteo Lord of Milan. Member of the Visconti di Oleggio Castello was Giovanni, Lord of Bologna (1355–1360) and Fermo. He had been wrongly considered an illegitimate son of Archbishop Giovanni Visconti.

===Descendants of Pietro (since the 13th century)===
From Ottone, son of Guido Visconti, descended the family of Archbishop Ottone and his nephew Tebaldo, executed in 1276 by the opposite faction supporting the Della Torre family. After the death of Tebaldo, a division of the family inheritance occurred in 1288 between his sons (Matteo and Uberto) and Pietro (another nephew of Archbishop Ottone). The object of the division was the lands and castles between Lake Maggiore and Gallarate (a long-established area of Visconti possessions), the family compound in the center of Milan, and other properties. To Pietro went the territories near Gallarate, fortified with castles scattered on the local hills, to Matteo and Uberto the remaining parts.

Among the descendants of Pietro, other divisions followed: first between his sons, Lodrisio and Gaspare, and a generation later among his grandchildren. The members of their offspring added the names of the inherited lands to their surnames. From the sons of Lodrisio (Ambrogio, Estorolo) originated the Visconti di Crenna and the Visconti di Besnate; from the sons of Gaspare (Azzo, Antonio, and Giovanni), the Visconti di Jerago, the Visconti di Orago, and the Visconti di Fontaneto. These branches became extinct in the following centuries, and their castles and lands passed to other families.

===Descendants of Uberto, brother of Matteo (since the 14th century)===
A generation after separating the lands assigned to Pietro, another hereditary division followed between Matteo and Uberto, sons of Tebaldo. Matteo became Lord of Milan, while Uberto (c. 1280–1315) received the castles of Cislago and Somma Lombardo with the lands subject to them and originated other cadet branches. Vercellino, the firstborn of Uberto, was Podestà of Vercelli (1317) and Novara (1318–1320).

From Vercellino, in the 15th century, descended Giambattista Visconti. In 1473, after his death, the castle of Somma Lombardo was divided between his sons, Francesco and Guido. The offspring of Francesco and Guido became known by the surname of Visconti di Somma. Several branches originated from them: among the descendants of Francesco, the Visconti di San Vito and the Visconti della Motta; from Guido, the Visconti di Modrone and the Visconti di Cislago.

====Visconti di San Vito====
A descendant of Francesco Visconti di Somma in the 17th century was Francesco Maria. In 1629, he received the title of Marquess of San Vito from the King of Spain. From him originated the Visconti di San Vito branch.

Between the 19th and 20th centuries, the Visconti di San Vito reunited the property of the castle of Somma Lombardo, fragmented after the division of 1473. The Visconti di San Vito became extinct in 1998. Their last member left the tenure of Somma Lombardo to a foundation bearing their name, which later opened the castle to the public.

====Visconti di Modrone====

From the descendants of Guido Visconti di Somma came the lateral branch of the Visconti di Modrone (marquesses of Vimodrone since 1694, later Dukes of Vimodrone since 1813). To this family belonged the film directors Luchino Visconti di Modrone and Eriprando Visconti di Modrone. Luchino was one of the most prominent directors of Italian neorealist cinema.

===Other members===
*Federico Visconti (1617–1693), Cardinal and Archbishop of Milan from 1681 to 1693.
*Filippo Maria Visconti (archbishop) (1721–1801), Archbishop of Milan from 1784 to 1801.
*Gaspare Visconti, Archbishop of Milan from 1584 to 1595.
*Roberto Visconti, Archbishop of Milan from 1354 to 1361.
==Builders and patrons of art and letters==
In the territories of their initial power and later expansion, the Visconti promoted the construction of secular and religious buildings. The magnificence of their most distinctive projects, conceived in the 14th century mainly for Milan and Pavia, reflected their policy of authority assertion over the regions under their rule. 

Patronage of arts and letters was a noticeable trait within the Visconti house. In the 14th century, the many family connections created by their marriage policies put the Visconti in a central position among the European aristocracy, which made, according to the art historian Serena Romano, the Milan of the Visconti, and later of the Sforza, “unrivaled in Europe as an artistic crossroad.”

===Policy of magnificence in the 14th century===
Azzone, Lord of Milan between 1329 and 1339, was the first Visconti to carry out an imposing building program to promote his seigniorial authority. He intervened in the city&#x27;s center in continuity with the urbanism of the Milanese commune, transforming the Broletto Vecchio (the center of the communal rule) into the Corte d&#x27;Arengo (today&#x27;s &quot;Palazzo Reale&quot;), the seat of his government. Near the Milan Cathedral, at the time Santa Maria Maggiore church, Azzone erected a bell tower taller than any other building in the territories under his rule, even surpassing Cremona&#x27;s Torrazzo. The bell tower collapsed in 1353 and was never rebuilt. In 1335, Azzone called Giotto in Milan to decorate the Corte d&#x27;Arengo. A fresco, today lost, representing the Worldly Glory and Azzone himself among the greatest rulers of the past, has been attributed to him.

Azzone&#x27;s policy of magnificence was continued by his successors Luchino and Giovanni and expanded in the second half of the 14th century by Galeazzo II, Bernabò, and Gian Galeazzo to a grandiosity level recognized in Europe. Near the Corte d&#x27;Arengo, Giovanni built the new episcopal palace. Luchino connected the Corte d&#x27;Arengo to the nearby Visconti&#x27;s private buildings by galleried walkways and bridges overpassing public streets. 
Between 1360 and 1365, Galeazzo II built a vast and widely decorated castle in Pavia, from where he and his son Gian Galeazzo ruled over their territories. According to Petrarch, who visited Pavia in 1365 and mentioned the castle in a letter addressed to Boccaccio, it was an &quot;enormous palace,&quot; and it would have been judged, by Boccaccio himself, &quot;the most majestic of all modern creations.&quot; 
Around 1370, Bernabò erected a castle at Trezzo sull&#x27;Adda in a few years, including a massive 42-meter-high tower and a fortified bridge over the Adda River. The bridge had a single arch 72 meters wide, a span never reached before and unsurpassed by a masonry structure until the 20th century.

In 1386, on the first anniversary of his ascent to power as sole ruler, Gian Galeazzo initiated the new Milan Cathedral, intended to be the largest church of Christendom. The ducal symbol of the radiant sun (&quot;Razza Viscontea&quot;) was chosen to decorate the main stained window of the central apse. 
Ten years later, Gian Galeazzo founded the Charterhouse of Pavia to host his family&#x27;s mausoleum. For its considerable dimensions and lavish decorations, it is today considered one of the most notable monuments in Italy. Gian Galeazzo connected the Pavia castle to the Charterhouse, located about 7 km north, by a large, enclosed park initiated by his father. The opulence of the Pavia Charterhouse, built and decorated entirely of white marble, struck Erasmus of Rotterdam, who considered it excessive for a monastery. 

===Builders===
Commissioning of private and public buildings (mainly castles and churches) was frequent among the Visconti branches and widespread in the territories under their rule. 
====Castles, palaces, public buildings====
The Visconti marked the territories of their origins and expansion with fortifications and palaces. Castles named after them (&quot;Castelli Viscontei&quot; in Italian) are frequent in Lombardy and Northern Italy. 

The area northwest of Milan and east of Lake Maggiore, traditionally inhabited by the Visconti, is marked by castles at Besnate, Crenna, Jerago, Orago, and Somma Lombardo. In the Visconti territories on the western side of Lake Maggiore, family branches adapted existing fortifications or erected new castles in Castelletto sopra Ticino, Invorio, Massino, and Oleggio Castello. 
In Milan, during the 14th and 15th centuries, the Visconti built the Castle of Porta Giovia on the site of a previous fortification. Destroyed after the end of the Visconti rule in the period of the Ambrosian Republic, it was rebuilt by Francesco Sforza. Continuously transformed over the centuries, it is today the Sforza Castle. 
To locally mark their power, the Visconti erected fortifications in the territories where they extended their dominion (Bellinzona, Bergamo, Cassano d&#x27;Adda, Castell&#x27;Arquato, Cherasco, Galliate, Lecco, Legnano, Locarno, Lodi, Monza, Novara, Piacenza, Vercelli, Voghera, Vogogna). Other castles were built near Milan and used by family members as secondary residences (Abbiategrasso, Bereguardo, Cusago, Pandino, Vigevano). 

After the extinction of the lineage ruling Milan, cadet branches continued to erect or transform castles and palaces in Milan and Lombardy, and today, many locations host buildings named from them: Cislago, Brignano Gera d&#x27;Adda, Fagnano Olona, Saronno, and Milan (Palazzo Visconti di Grazzano, Palazzo Prospero Visconti). 

The need to connect the Visconti territories led to the construction of fortified bridges, in Lecco and Trezzo sull&#x27;Adda. Two ambitious programs to divert the waters of rivers flowing toward enemy cities, Mantova e Padova, prompted Gian Galeazzo to build two dams at Valeggio sul Mincio and Bassano del Grappa. 

In 1457, Bianca Maria Visconti and her husband Francesco Sforza donated the site of a previous Visconti stronghold in the center of Milan to fund the Ca&#x27; Granda, the new and vast city hospital. After Filarete&#x27;s project, its construction continued over the following centuries, financed exclusively by private donations.

====Churches and monasteries====
The Visconti&#x27;s power over Milan was rooted in their family compound in the city center near the Corte d&#x27;Arengo, where the churches of San Gottardo in Corte and San Giovanni in Conca were the first examples of their palatine chapels. The second was transformed into the private church of Bernabò&#x27;s family. The Visconti added a chapel to the church of Sant&#x27;Eustorgio, serving as their family burial site. 

Visconti&#x27;s coat of arms, the &quot;Biscione&quot;, marked the façade of minor Milanese churches under their patronage, making them recognizable today (San Cristoforo, Santa Maria Incoronata). Regina Della Scala, the wife of Bernabò, erected the Santa Maria della Scala church, named after her surname. It was demolished in the 18th century to make way for the construction of a new theatre, which kept again her surname. 
The Visconti favored the Carthusian order. The grandiose Pavia Charterhouse was preceded by the Garegnano Charterhouse, founded by archbishop Giovanni Visconti in 1349. 

The Visconti used the churches they built in Milan and Pavia as burial places: Ottone and Giovanni in the Cathedral, Azzone in San Gottardo in Corte, Stefano in Sant&#x27;Eustorgio, Bernabò in San Giovanni in Conca and Gian Galeazzo in the Pavia Charterhouse. 

===Patrons of art and letters ===
====In Lombardy==== 
Since the first years of their rule of Milan, the Visconti patronized art and letters, on several occasions to celebrate their members&#x27; achievements. 

A poem written by the contemporary Dominican Stefanardo da Vimercate (&quot;Liber de gestis in civitate Mediolani&quot;) told the story of archbishop Ottone Visconti, culminating with his victory over the Della Torre in 1277. A few years later, probably before the end of the 13th century, an anonymous painter (known as Maestro di Angera) frescoed the main events of that story on the wall of the Sala di Giustizia (Hall of Justice) in the Angera castle. 
Giotto&#x27;s stay in Milan and his work in the Corte d&#x27;Arengo, commissioned by Azzone Visconti, marked a turning point in Lombard painting and inspired local artists who worked in other Visconti buildings. The nearby Archbishop&#x27;s palace, under Giovanni Visconti, and San Giovanni in Conca church, under Bernabò Visconti, were extensively decorated with frescoes. Today, only a few fragments survive. 

After exchanging letters with Luchino Visconti in 1353, Petrarch accepted, despite the opposition of his friend Boccaccio, the invitation of Archbishop Giovanni Visconti and spent the following eight years in Milan. He remained a friend of Galeazzo II and returned to Pavia and Milan on several occasions. 

The numerous rooms of the Pavia Castle were painted with decorative frescoes. Due to the vastness of the walls to be decorated and needing more painters, Galeazzo II requested the Gonzagas of Mantua to send all the artists available there to Pavia. In the castle of Pavia, on the first floor of the western tower, Galeazzo II Visconti set up a vast library. It contained about one thousand books by classical and contemporary authors and was renowned in Europe. 
Under the patronage of the Visconti, Pavia University became one of the most esteemed in Europe. To help the students attend the university, Galeazzo II supported them with endowments. 

The Visconti commissioned statues and funeral monuments to prominent sculptors. Giovanni di Balduccio made the funeral monument of Azzone Visconti in the San Gottardo in Corte church. Bonino da Campione sculpted an equestrian statue of Bernabò, which was later placed on his sarcophagus in the San Giovanni in Conca church and decorated the tomb of his wife Regina della Scala; they are today preserved in the Sforza castle museum (&quot;Museo d&#x27;Arte Antica&quot;). Bianca Maria Visconti and her husband, Francesco Sforza, favored the portraiture of Bonifacio Bembo, who was granted Milanese citizenship. 

The outstanding marble construction effort and the sculptural decorations characterizing the religious buildings initiated by Gian Galeazzo (Milan Cathedral and Pavia Charterhouse) continued in the following centuries. The first sculptors to work there during Visconti&#x27;s rule were Giovannino de&#x27; Grassi and Giacomo da Campione. The painter Michelino da Besozzo worked on the Cathedral stained glass.

====Influences in Europe==== 
The many relationships established by the Visconti with other European ruling families contributed to spreading the incipient Renaissance humanism outside Italy. 

During his stay in Milan, the Visconti sent Petrarch on two missions to Europe. In 1356, he went to Prague, where he met Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1361, Galeazzo II sent Petrarch to Paris to congratulate King John II for his release after the English captivity. As a gift, he brought a ring lost by the King in the battle of Poitiers and recovered by Galeazzo II. His oration to the King praised his daughter, Isabella, now living in Pavia as Gian Galeazzo&#x27;s wife, and talked about the Fortuna. The impression he made on the courts of Prague and Paris led the emperor and the French royal family to invite Petrarch to stay by them, but, in both cases, he preferred to return to Milan. Petrarch&#x27;s book &quot;De remediis utriusque fortune&quot;, conceived under the influence of Milanese literary culture, had great resonance in Europe.

In 1368, the marriage ceremony of Violante Visconti to the son of the King of England and the subsequent nuptial banquet was attended by Petrarch, Jean Froissart, who had accompanied the bridegroom in his journey to Italy, and maybe Geoffrey Chaucer. Later, in 1372/1373 and 1378, Chaucer traveled to Milan and Pavia, where he had access to the Visconti libraries and met Petrarch. These two circumstances played a role in Italian humanism&#x27;s influence on him.
The marriages of five daughters of Bernabò to German and Austrian princes (Antonia in Württemberg; Taddea, Maddalena, and Elisabetta in Bavaria; Viridis in Austria) are credited to have contributed to a culture transfer to the regions ruled by their husbands. The marriage of Valentina to Louis I, Duke of Orléans, in 1389 influenced literary and artistic developments in France.

The construction site of the new cathedral attracted architects, engineers, and sculptors from France and Germany (Nicolas de Bonaventure, Jacques Coene, Ulrich von Ensingen, Hans von Fernach, Heinrich Parler von Gmünd, Jean Mignot, Peter Monich, Walter Monich), who interacted with the Italian ones. As a result, Milan Cathedral became symbolic of the International Lombard Gothic style.

During the Italian wars, the Visconti Library in Pavia, rich in 1,000 manuscripts, raised the interest of Louis XII, King of France, who transferred most of them to Blois, France. Today, they are preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.

==Portrayal in pop culture==
In Thomas Harris&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Hannibal&quot;, the serial killer Hannibal Lecter is a member of the Visconti family, descended from them through his mother Simonetta. The Visconti family crest is used as the cover of the book.

<text>Unimak Island (, ) is the largest island in the Aleutian Islands chain of the U.S. state of Alaska.

==Geography==
It is the easternmost island in the Aleutians and, with an area of , the 9th largest island in the United States and the 134th largest island in the world. It is home to Mount Shishaldin, one of the ten most active volcanoes in the world. According to the United States Census Bureau, 64 people were living on Unimak as of the 2000 census, all of them in the city of False Pass at the eastern end of the island. Cape Lutke is a headland on the island. Cape Pankof is located at the extreme southwest of the island.

The Fisher Caldera is a volcanic crater in the west-central part of Unimak. Some characteristics include many volcanic cones and undrained lakes. It is named for Bernard Fisher, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist who was killed in Umnak Pass.

Mount Westdahl, in elevation, is a stratovolcano of the Aleutian Range on the island situated at its western end.

==Natural history==
When the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act was passed on 2 December 1980, of the island was designated as wilderness. This area is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.

As a faunal extension of the Alaska Peninsula, Unimak has a relatively diverse assemblage of terrestrial mammals, including Alaska Peninsula brown bears and porcupine caribou. West of Unimak Island, the largest native mammal in the Aleutians is the red fox.

==Buildings==
Scotch Cap Lighthouse was built in 1903 and was staffed by the US Coast Guard. On April 1, 1946, during the 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake, the lighthouse was struck by a tsunami. Even though the lighthouse was above the sea, the lighthouse slid into the sea, killing five Coast Guard personnel.

The Cape Sarichef Lighthouse and the Cape Sarichef Airport are also located on the island.

<doc id="571735" wikidata="Q2715128" url="?curid=571735" title="Londo Mollari">
<text>Londo Mollari is a fictional character in the universe of the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, played by Peter Jurasik.

Although Londo began as a supporting player in the early episodes, his actions and character development as the series progressed had an immeasurable effect on the show, making him one of the more significant characters in the series. He begins as an apparent stock character assigned to the role of loud, jovial comic relief. Later in the series, he is shown to be an embittered patriot of a dying empire, eager to restore its primacy. In doing so, he becomes largely an unwitting pawn of the Shadows, and the intrigues that he engages in are central to the show&#x27;s plot. Mollari is also a man of honor, and the moral consequences of his plots weigh heavily on him. By the series&#x27; end, he finally makes things right at the cost of his own life.

== Character description ==
=== Overview ===
Londo Mollari is a member of one of the oldest Noble Houses of the Centauri Republic. He is a mercurial personality given to extreme manifestations of anger, sadness, or joviality, depending on the power of the catalyst provoking them. While he is an avid hedonist who is fond of drink and leisure, he is also a devout Centauri patriot and would gladly give his life without hesitation to protect the Republic. A staunch traditionalist, Londo has a profound sense of pride which is tied to the heritage of the Centauri imperial history, when the republic was a vast empire with tremendous influence across the known galaxy; Londo was once a military officer with several heroic accomplishments, which he relishes and often reminisces on when intoxicated. But the decline of the expansionist tradition has weakened the prestige of the Centauri Republic in the eyes of the galactic community, particularly the emancipation of the Narn homeworld from Centauri colonial rule. These developments have wounded Londo&#x27;s pride in his people and himself, and he is extremely bitter about his people&#x27;s loss of face. He resents the Narn for their eventual success in establishing themselves as a viable independent power and for what he feels is their part in the increasingly unimportant and humiliating political positions he has held in the latter years of his life, most of which were diplomatic titles with little significance in the royal court. Londo&#x27;s greatest desire is to see the restoration of the Centauri Republic to the glory and influence it held in older times, and it is this desperate longing that proves the undoing of himself and his people.

Despite his temperamental and stodgy nature, Londo himself is largely devoid of malice. His bigotry towards other races, particularly the Narns, is largely based on habituation and national identity rather than actual hatred; he is rather fond of humans given the similarities in behavior between them and his own people, and speaks in obvious admiration of the human military&#x27;s tenacity during the Earth–Minbari war. Londo is averse to violence and is often at odds with himself over his desire for military victory and the horror he feels at the suffering and death of others; when he is present at the Second Conquest of Narn, he is visibly sickened by the level of destruction and death he has semi-unwittingly caused and later challenges Lord Refa over his use of outlawed Mass Drivers in the planetary assault on Narn. He yearns for honor and respect, but is often uncomfortable with the cost and responsibilities that come with it.

Londo is very appreciative of his friends and reluctantly tolerant of insincerity; he often chooses the friendship of people with temperaments similar to his own but with personalities suited towards brutal honesty (Michael Garibaldi) or sincere naivety (Lennier, Vir Cotto). Of the three wives he possesses, the only one he does not divorce is his abrasive wife Timov (who absolutely despises him and shows him not the slightest shred of respect) because her scathing honesty is preferable to the feigned friendliness and scheming of the other two. His greatest love, other than his people, is the romantic company of Lady Adira, a former slave and dancer whose benign and sincere nature pierced all the practised cynicism he has built over the course of his life. One of Londo&#x27;s few real friends is Urza Jaddo, whom Londo must kill in a duel because of the intrigues of Lord Refa.

Londo&#x27;s closest friend is his attache Vir Cotto. Initially, the two had a comically adversarial relationship: Vir was guileless, naive and extremely honest and empathetic, making him completely inept at Centauri political process, which irked Londo no end. Londo thoroughly enjoyed tormenting him with outrageous demands and workloads in an attempt to train him to be a more efficient Centauri, but over the course of The Shadow War, the Earth Civil War, and the rebuilding of Centauri, the two became almost inseparable. Though Londo never truly abandons his playful condescension towards Vir for his beneficence and even disagrees with his empathy at times, Londo admires and envies Vir&#x27;s innocence and respects his opinion and assistance throughout his career.

The onset of the wars that nearly consume the galaxy in the series – especially his own complicity in their occurrence – changes Londo from an embittered patriot longing for the old days to a more introspective and sympathetic man determined to rebuild not just his own society, but that of others; prior to his coronation as Emperor, he becomes a significant force in emancipating and restoring Narn and in assisting the Interstellar Alliance in bringing peace to the galaxy.

=== Ambassador to Babylon 5 ===
The Centauri culture in the series is patterned on the conventions of early imperial Rome (which still fancied itself a Republic despite having an Emperor at its head) and portrayed with a nod to the visualizations of the empire depicted in the Dune motion picture (with futuristic versions of 18th-century uniform and clothes as the choice for Centauri attire). The Centauri state is depicted in decline: it falls prey to decadence and internal politics even while it hungers to return to its days of glory. As such, Londo is depicted as a reflection of the society from which he comes. In the words of series creator J. Michael Straczynski, he is &quot;overweight, prone to gambling constantly (null-pool is his favorite) and fond of women and drinks&quot;. Considered something of a buffoon even among the Centauri, Londo has been assigned the post of Centauri Ambassador to Babylon 5 to keep him out of the way (according to &quot;Babylon 5: In the Beginning&quot; he used to be the official Centauri Ambassador on Earth).

At the start of the series, Londo seems to be ineffective in his role as ambassador. His drunken temper tantrums and posturing upon the glories of the &quot;Great Centauri Past&quot; make him appear to be a buffoon. However, he climbs Centauri Prime&#x27;s political ladder through manipulating his people&#x27;s hatred of the Narn Regime (former slaves of the Centauri, who fought for and won their independence). Indeed, Londo has a hatred for the Narn Ambassador, G&#x27;Kar when the series begins. Gradually, however, this softens as time passes. Towards the end of the series, Londo and G&#x27;Kar put their differences aside and for the most part, become friends, of sorts. His cynical political ambition – and his sincere craving to restore the pre-eminence of Centauri Prime – make him into the perfect target for the dark and mysterious Morden, who is secretly representing the Shadows as they work to rebuild their strength. Morden asks each of the major Ambassadors one question – &quot;What do you want?&quot; – only Londo gives him the appropriate answer: glory and prestige for himself and the Centauri. Through the course of the series, Morden and his &quot;Associates&quot; repeatedly give Londo exactly what he asks for, which proves to be far from what Londo actually wants. As Narn fleets continue to be wiped out without any survivors to explain how, Londo takes credit and attracts a great deal of much-desired attention and power, never questioning the consequences of his alliance with the Shadows until it is far too late.

Eventually, after having proved the capability of his &quot;Associates&quot; beyond any doubt, Morden begins to request favors from Londo. Londo, driven by his own pride as well as his fear that Morden may leave and turn elsewhere for help, gives in each time. Despite his conscience bothering him about the nature of these requests, he finds himself unable to sever his connection with Morden.

=== Saving Centauri Prime ===
As the events of the Shadow War come to a peak, Mollari is promoted to the position of advisor on planetary security, which requires him to return to his home world. Mollari is angered by the promotion, understanding that it is not a reward for his service but a leash to keep him and his newfound power under control. Upon his return to Centauri Prime, Mollari discovers that the young Emperor Cartagia, whose ascent to the throne he personally endorsed, is insane and has allowed the Shadows to establish a base on Centauri Prime. At the same time, the Vorlons have begun a campaign to completely destroy any planet where the Shadows have influence. In his insanity, Cartagia believes the Shadows would elevate him to godhood and insists they stay. Mollari realized that in order to deal with the Shadows and save his world from the Vorlons, Cartagia must be killed.

Mollari begins a conspiracy to have Cartagia assassinated, with the help of Vir Cotto, a number of high-ranking Centauri, and G&#x27;Kar, who is Cartagia&#x27;s prisoner at the time. They plan to lure Cartagia to Narn, where he will be away from the majority of his guards and vulnerable. There, G&#x27;Kar will be able to create a security threat by escaping, and in the confusion Londo will kill Cartagia by injecting him with a poison that will cause both of his hearts to shut down. The plot succeeds, although as it turns out, Cartagia attacks Londo and Vir must inject the poison. After the Emperor is pronounced dead, Mollari fulfills a promise to G&#x27;Kar, that in return for his help, Narn will be freed from Centauri rule (although the Narn believe that they have once again driven the Centauri away &quot;through strength&quot;).

With Cartagia dead and a Vorlon fleet en route to destroy Centauri Prime, Mollari is promoted to the position of Prime Minister, making him temporarily head of state until a new Emperor can be elected. With his new power, Mollari proceeds to blow up the Shadow base on Centauri Prime, and then execute their agent, Morden – who, he discovers, had Adira killed. He believes that this would redeem Centauri Prime from being destroyed by the Vorlons; however, Vir realizes that Londo himself has been influenced and used by the Shadows, and so the Vorlons would want him destroyed too. As the Vorlon fleet comes into orbit around Centauri Prime, blotting out the sun, it becomes clear that the Vorlons would destroy the whole planet just to get Mollari. Londo implores Vir to kill him and show the Vorlons he had done it, but is saved by the fact that at the same time, in another part of the galaxy, a fleet led by Sheridan is battling the Shadows and Vorlons at Corianna 6 (Sheridan&#x27;s fleet&#x27;s final battle, as it turns out), and the Vorlons call in all their remaining ships to help. Thus Vir does not have to kill Londo, and the planet is spared. But in saving Centauri Prime, Londo has unknowingly doomed his world to a different fate that will be almost as terrible.

=== Emperor Mollari II ===
Following the galactic war with the Shadows, Mollari eventually rises to become Emperor of the Centauri Republic, taking the title Emperor Mollari II (since another member of his family was Emperor in the past). One of his first acts as the new Emperor is to name Vir Cotto as his replacement on Babylon 5— a job not highly prized because of the earlier Centauri conquest of Narn— though Londo knows that Vir will fulfill the job dutifully, even if some of the other ambassadors distrust him.

Before his official installation as Emperor Mollari II, Londo confides in his now ex-bodyguard, Ambassador G&#x27;Kar, &quot;When we met, I had no power and all the choices I could ever want. Now I have all the power I could ever want and no choices at all.&quot;

At the end of the fifth season, it is revealed that the Drakh had manipulated the Interstellar Alliance into attacking the Centauri Homeworld and decided they needed Londo to be Emperor. The Regent, Virini, dies when his keeper is removed, and another keeper is attached to Londo. For the next 15 years, Londo reigns as Emperor. He soon learns that alcohol puts the Keeper to sleep, allowing him a few minutes of freedom.

When the Drakh kidnap David Sheridan, the son of John and Delenn, the couple come to Centauri Prime to free him. Both Sheridan and Delenn are captured by the Centauri. Mollari tries to force the Drakh to leave; they respond by exploding fusion bombs they had planted on the surface of the planet. Mollari is told to execute Sheridan and is able to convince his Keeper that he will soon kill both Sheridan and Delenn. He then ingests enough alcohol to put the Keeper to sleep and frees Sheridan, Delenn, and their son in exchange for their help in freeing the Centauri from the Drakh.

Mollari knows that his Keeper will soon wake up and alert the other Drakh that he had set his friends free, and that the Drakh will kill them, and then kill him for his betrayal. G&#x27;Kar enters the throne room. Mollari explains the situation and begs G&#x27;Kar to kill him before the Keeper wakes up, saying &quot;I am as tired of my life as you are.&quot; G&#x27;Kar begins to crush Mollari&#x27;s throat, but does not finish before the Keeper awakens. The Keeper seizes control of Mollari and retaliates. Mollari and G&#x27;Kar finally die at each other&#x27;s hands, just as Londo has predicted 20 years before.

A few hours before his death, in the events of &quot;Babylon 5: In the Beginning&quot;, Mollari had a random encounter with two Centauri children (who turned out to be the nephew and niece of Urza Jaddo, while their governess, Senna, proved to be the daughter of Lord Refa). He granted them a favor by telling them the tale of the Earth-Minbari War. He also commented upon the terrible events that had befallen Centauri Prime, saying that while he had cared for each of his wives in his own way, he loved Centauri Prime the most, and that everything he had done had been &quot;for her&quot;.

Following Mollari&#x27;s death, Vir Cotto finds Mollari and G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s lifeless bodies on the floor of the throne room. He manages to escape from the Centauri homeworld (avoiding the inevitable Drakh attempt to place a Keeper on him), and goes to Minbar. In a conference with the surviving members of the Centauri houses, Cotto is named the next Emperor, fulfilling Lady Morella&#x27;s prophecy that both Londo and Vir would be Emperor, but one would be Emperor only after the other&#x27;s death. Emperor Cotto is able to finally free his homeworld from the clutches of the Drakh. To commemorate Londo and G&#x27;Kar, he orders twin statues of them erected in front of the Centauri Royal Palace, symbolically guarding the city and watching each other&#x27;s backs.

In 2281, John Sheridan is dying. Emperor Cotto goes to Minbar for one last meal with Sheridan and his friends. When the time comes to remember all who died, Cotto raises his glass to the memory of Londo Mollari.

<text>The Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania (), or simply the Seimas ( ; ), is the unicameral legislative body of the Republic of Lithuania. The Seimas constitutes the legislative branch of government in Lithuania, enacting laws and amendments to the Constitution, passing the budget, confirming the Prime Minister and the Government and controlling their activities.

Its 141 members are elected for a four-year term, with 71 elected in individual constituencies, and 70 elected in a nationwide vote based on open list proportional representation. A party must receive at least 5%, and a multi-party union at least 7%, of the national vote to qualify for the proportional representation seats.

Following the elections in 2024, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania is the largest party in the Seimas, signing an agreement to form a coalition government with the Union of Democrats &quot;For Lithuania&quot; and the Dawn of Nemunas.

The Seimas traces its origins to the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Sejm of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as well as the Seimas of inter-war Lithuania. The first Seimas after the restoration of independence of Lithuania convened in 1992.

==History==

===Origins===
The first traces of large nobility meetings can be found in the negotiations for Treaty of Salynas in 1398. However, it is considered that the first Seimas met in Hrodna in 1445 during talks between Casimir IV Jagiellon and the Council of Lords. As the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars raged, the Grand Duke needed more tax revenues to finance the army and had to call the Seimas more frequently. In exchange for increased taxation, the nobility demanded various privileges, including strengthening the Seimas.

At first the Seimas did not have the legislative power. It would debate on foreign and domestic affairs, taxes, wars and treasury. At this time, there were no rules regulating how frequently the Seimas would assemble, who could participate, how the sessions should take place or what functions the Seimas had. At the beginning of the 16th century, the Seimas acquired some legislative powers and could petition the Grand Duke to pass certain laws, which the Duke usually granted in exchange for nobility&#x27;s support and cooperation in taxation and war matters.

Major reforms were carried out between 1564 and 1566, just before the Union of Lublin. In the Second Statute of Lithuania, the Seimas acquired full legislative powers, acting as the lower house of the parliament, with the Lithuanian Council of Lords as the upper house. It was at this point that elections to the Seimas were introduced (local nobles would elect their delegates) – any noble could participate in the Seimas before.

Seimas of the Grand Dutchy was abolished in 1569, with the Union of Lublin. The Union created a new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and joined the Seimas of Lithuania with the Sejm of Poland into a single Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. By this time, 40 Seimas of Lithuania had taken place.

Nobles of Lithuania continued to meet until the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth under the name of Lithuanian Convocations. They debated matters concerning the Grand Duchy of Lithuania or tried to establish a common position among Lithuanian delegates before departing for the Sejm of the Commonwealth.

The Sejm of the Commonwealth, General Sejm, was the parliament of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the Union of Lublin until the late 18th century. The sejm was a powerful political institution, and from early 16th century, the Polish king (who was the Grand Duke of Lithuania) could not pass laws without the approval of that body.
Duration and frequencies of the sejms changed over time, with the six-week sejm session convened every two years being most common. Sejm locations changed throughout history, eventually with the Commonwealth capital of Warsaw emerging as the primary location. The number of sejm deputies and senators grew over time, from about 70 senators and 50 deputies in the 15th century to about 150 senators and 200 deputies in the 18th century. Early sejms have seen mostly majority voting, but beginning in the 17th century, unanimous voting became more common, and 32 sejms were vetoed with the infamous liberum veto, particularly in the first half of the 18th century. This vetoing procedure has been credited with significantly paralyzing the Commonwealth governance. In addition, beginning in 1573, three special types of sejms handled the process of the royal election in the interregnum period.

The Great Seimas of Vilnius was a major assembly held on December 4 and 5, 1905 in Vilnius, Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire, largely inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1905. It was the first modern national congress in Lithuania, with over 2,000 participants. The assembly made the decision to demand wide political autonomy within the Russian Empire and achieve this by peaceful means. It is considered an important step towards the Act of Independence of Lithuania, adopted on February 16, 1918 by the Council of Lithuania, as the Seimas laid the groundwork for the establishment of an independent Lithuanian state.

===Interwar period===

The first widely elected body in Lithuania after the declaration of independence on February 16, 1918, was the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania. The election was held on April 14–15, 1920. The voter turnout reached about 90%.

The primary role of the Constituent Assembly was to adopt the Constitution of Lithuania, which was accomplished on August 1, 1922. The new constitution gave broad powers to the parliament, the Seimas, elected to a three-year term. Seimas would select the Cabinet of Ministers and elect the President. In addition, the Constituent Assembly adopted numerous laws, including a broad land reform and introduced Litas as the national currency.

The First Seimas of Lithuania was the first parliament of Lithuania elected in accordance with the constitution of 1922. The election took place on October 10–11, 1922. However, no party was able to form a sustainable coalition and the Seimas was dissolved on March 12, 1923. New elections were held on May 12 and May 13.

The Second Seimas of Lithuania was the only regular interwar Seimas which completed its full three-year term. The Christian Democrats gained two additional seats which were enough to give them a slim majority. The Seimas continued the land reform, expanded the network of primary and secondary schools and introduced a system of social support. However, it did not bring political stability, as it saw several short-lived governments.

The Third Seimas of Lithuania was elected on May 8–10, 1926, with the Christian Democrats in opposition for the first time. The Lithuanian Popular Peasants&#x27; Union and Social Democrats formed a coalition government which lifted martial law, restored democratic freedoms, and declared broad amnesty to political prisoners. However, the government was sharply criticized following some unpopular decisions. The Seimas was interrupted by 1926 Lithuanian coup d&#x27;état in December, when the democratically elected government was replaced with the authoritarian rule of Antanas Smetona. The Third Seimas was dissolved on March 12, 1927 and new elections were not called until 1936.

The Fourth Seimas of Lithuania was elected on 9 and 10 June 1936. Elections took place under the constitution of 1928, which had been proclaimed by president Smetona without the assent of the Seimas. The parliament was elected to a five-year term. With opposition parties effectively barred from participating, Lithuanian Nationalists Union got 42 (of 49) seats, with the remaining seven seats taken by the Young Lithuania, a youth branch of the Nationalists Union. The primary task of the new Seimas was to adopt a new constitution, which was accomplished on 11 February 1938. The new constitution provided for even more powers to the president.

After the Soviet ultimatum in June 1940 and subsequent occupation, the Fourth Seimas was dismissed and a puppet People&#x27;s Seimas was elected in a heavily rigged elections, in order to give legal sanction to the occupation and annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union. The new parliament proclaimed the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, petitioned for admission to the Soviet Union (a petition that was accepted on August 3, 1940), adopted a new constitution and renamed itself to the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, a rubber stamp legislature.

===Since 1990===

On March 11, 1990, the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR proclaimed the independence of Lithuania from the Soviet Union, renaming itself the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania (also called Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas, and regarded as the Fifth Seimas). The council adopted the Provisional Basic Law that served as a temporary constitution and worked on the Constitution of Lithuania that was submitted and approved by voters in a referendum on October 25, 1992.

Seven elections of the Seimas have since taken place under the constitution.

The first election in independent Lithuania was held on October 25, 1992, with a run-off on November 15. The election was won by the (ex-communist) Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania, which gained 73 of the 141 seats in the Sixth Seimas. Algirdas Brazauskas was elected the first speaker of the Seimas on November 25, 1992, becoming the acting President on the same day. Česlovas Juršėnas then became the acting (and later permanent) Speaker of the Seimas. The period was plagued by poor economic situation and financial scandals, including one involving former Prime Minister Adolfas Šleževičius.

The election to the Seventh Seimas was held on October 20, 1996 with the run-off on November 10. The election was won by the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Conservative Party, which gained 70 seats and formed a coalition with the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party (16 seats). Later part of the term of the Seimas was again characterized by an economic crisis, brought about by Russian financial crisis of 1998. In addition, several high-profile privatizations were undertaken, including that of Mazeikiu Nafta oil refinery. Vytautas Landsbergis served as the Speaker of the Seimas during the term.

The Eighth Seimas was elected on October 8, 2000. Liberal Union of Lithuania won the most seats of any party in the election, with 33, forming the government with New Union (Social Liberals) (its leader, Artūras Paulauskas becoming the Speaker of the Seimas), Lithuanian Centre Union and the Modern Christian Democrats. The coalition was short-lived and Algirdas Brazauskas, a social democrat, became the prime minister less than a year later. This term of the Seimas saw Lithuania fulfilling its long-term foreign policy goals of joining NATO and the European Union. Speaker of the Seimas Artūras Paulauskas also served for two months in 2004 as the Acting President of Lithuania after the impeachement of Rolandas Paksas and before the new election took place.

The Social Democrats remained at the helm of the government after the 2004 parliamentary election, which was held on October 10, with the run-off on October 24. The party was the third-largest in the Ninth Seimas after the election with 20 seats, behind Labour Party with 39 and Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives) with 25, but managed to govern together with New Union (Social Liberals) (11 seats), the Labour Party and the support of other parties. It was the first time since independence that a ruling government survived an election. Artūras Paulauskas was reelected as the Speaker of the Seimas, but was replaced by Viktoras Muntianas in 2006. In 2006, the Labour Party left the coalition when its leader was removed from the post of Minister of Economy and the Social Democrats formed a coalition with the Civil Democracy Party, the Peasants and People&#x27;s Party, and the Liberal and Centre Union, although the coalition had to rule in a minority and relied on support of opposition parties. New Union (Social Liberals) later rejoined the coalition in early 2008. Česlovas Juršėnas once again became the Speaker of the Seimas in April 2008.

The Tenth Seimas was elected on October 12, 2008, with a run-off on October 26. Homeland Union became the largest party with 45 seats, forming a coalition with populist and short-lived National Resurrection Party (16 seats), Liberal Movement (11 seats) and Liberal and Centre Union (8 seats). Arūnas Valinskas of the National Resurrection Party was elected the Speaker of the Seimas. Ten months later, on September 17, 2009, he was replaced by Irena Degutienė of the Homeland Union, who became the first female Speaker of the Seimas. The term of the Tenth Seimas was plagued a severe economic crisis and the bust of the housing bubble. The Seimas and the Government responded with a wide-ranging and much-criticized tax reform and severe austerity, bringing about wide dissatisfaction and protests.

As a result of widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition, the ruling parties fared poorly in the 2012 parliamentary election. The Social Democrats became the largest party in the Eleventh Seimas, with 38 seats, forming a government coalition with Labour Party (19 seats), Order and Justice (11 seats) and Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania (8 seats). Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania withdrawn from the coalition in 2014.

Elections in 2016 resulted in a smaller shift of power. Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, a minor party in the preceding parliament, won a sweeping victory, securing 54 seats in the Twelfth Seimas (eventually rising to 59 as they were joined by several independents). The Social Democrats lost a lot of their support and finished with 17 seats (they were joined in the Seimas by the two members of Labour Party), but remained as a junior partner in the ruling coalition with Peasants and Greens Union. By 2019, the coalition included two other parties (Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania and Order and Justice), but the latter was expelled in the same year.

The Thirteenth Seimas was elected in two rounds on 11 and 25 October 2020 and resulted in an upheaval of the government. The previously dominant Farmers and Greens Union lost much of their support, finishing in second place with 32 seats, and entering the opposition along with their previous partners. The Homeland Union finished first with 50 seats and formed a centre-right coalition government with the Liberal Movement (13 seats) and the newly formed Freedom Party (11 seats).

Elections in 2024, held on 13 and 27 October 2024 to determine the composition of the Fourteenth Seimas, again resulted in an overturning of the government. The previously dominant Homeland Union finished in second place with 28 seats and entered the opposition along with their previous partners. The Lithuanian Social Democratic Party finished first with 52 seats and formed a centre-left coalition with two newly formed parties: the Union of Democrats &quot;For Lithuania&quot; (14 seats) and Dawn of Nemunas (20 seats). The inclusion of Dawn of Nemunas in the ruling coalition sparked local and international backlash due to past anti-Semitic statements made by the party&#x27;s founder.

==Parliamentary mandate==

The Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania exercises legislative power in Lithuania. The powers of the Seimas are defined by the Constitution and the laws of Lithuania.

The primary function of the Seimas is to consider, adopt and issue laws and amendments to the Constitution. The Seimas also approves the state budget proposed by the Government, supervises its implementation, and sets state taxation. In foreign relations, the Seimas ratifies international treaties.

Decisions of the Seimas are taken in open simple majority votes. In some cases prescribed by law, a secret ballot is held, for example in expressing no-confidence in the government. Constitutional laws are adopted by the Seimas in a majority vote and can be changed only by a 3/5 majority vote. The list of constitutional laws needs to be approved in a 3/5 majority vote. Changes to the Constitution itself need to be approved in two votes separated by no less than three months, by a 2/3 majority. Changes to international borders of Lithuania need to be approved by 4/5 of the members of the Seimas.

The Seimas approves or rejects the candidate for the Prime Minister nominated by the President. The Seimas must also give its assent to the newly formed Government and its programme before the Government can start their work. The Government remains accountable to the Seimas for its activities. If the Seimas expresses no-confidence in the Prime Minister or the Government as a whole, the Government must resign and can ask the president to call an early election.

Members of Seimas have legal immunity and cannot be arrested or detained without the consent of the vote of Seimas.

The Seimas appoints and dismisses justices and presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, proposed by the President. In its legislative capacity, the Seimas also sets the basis for a judiciary institution advising and, to some extent, binding the President in appointing, promoting or dismissing other judges.

The Seimas also establishes and disestablishes ministries of the Government, establishes state awards, can declare martial law and emergencies, start mobilization and introduce direct local rule on municipalities.

==Elections==
===Electoral process===

The Seimas has 141 members, elected to a four-year term in parallel voting, with 71 members elected in single-seat constituencies and 70 members elected by proportional representation. Ordinary elections to the Seimas take place on the second Sunday of October, with the voting open for all citizens of Lithuania who are at least 18 years old.

Members of Parliament in the 71 single-seat constituencies are elected in a majority vote, with a run-off held within 15 days, if necessary. The remaining 70 seats are allocated to the participating political parties using the largest remainder method. Parties normally need to receive at least 5% (7% for multi-party electoral lists) of the votes to be eligible for a seat. Candidates take the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the election and adjusted by preference votes given by the voters.

===Latest election===


===Previous elections===
Nine elections of the Seimas have been held in Lithuania since independence in 1990.

Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania won the absolute majority of seats in the first election in 1992, the only time it has been achieved in independent Lithuania as of 2015. The party suffered electoral setback in 1996, but remained a major electoral force in the election of 2000 (in cooperation with Social Democratic Party of Lithuania), allowing it to form the government in 2001. The two parties merged in 2001 under the banner of Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and formed the government after the elections of 2004, 2012, and 2024. The Social Democratic Party also participated in the government as a junior partner after the elections of 2016.

Sąjūdis, which had led Lithuania into independence, finished distant second in 1992. 
Its right wing formed the Homeland Union, a conservative party which won the election in 1996, gaining 70 seats and governing with the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. The two parties merged in 2008 under the banner of Homeland Union, winning the election in the same year with 45 seats. The Homeland Union returned to power following its victory in the 2020 election.

Other parties that have gained at least 10 seats in any election to the Seimas are:
* Centre Union of Lithuania (part of the ruling coalition between 1996 and 1999, later merged with the Liberal Union of Lithuania to form the Liberal and Centre Union)
* New Union (Social Liberals) (part of the ruling coalition between 2001 and 2008, later merged with the Labour Party)
* Liberal Union of Lithuania (part of the ruling coalition between 2000 and 2001, later merged with the Centre Union of Lithuania to form the Liberal and Centre Union)
* Labour Party (part of the ruling coalition between 2004 and 2008, as well as between 2012 and 2016)
* Order and Justice (part of the ruling coalition between 2012 and 2016, as well as a period in 2019, later merged into Freedom and Justice)
* Liberal and Centre Union (part of the ruling coalition between 2008 and 2012, later merged with YES to form the Lithuanian Freedom Union)
* Peasants and New Democratic Party Union (now the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, leading a coalition government from 2016 to 2020)
* National Resurrection Party (part of the ruling coalition between 2008 and 2011, when it merged into the Liberal and Centre Union)
* Liberal Movement (part of the ruling coalition between 2008 and 2012, as well as between 2020 and 2024)
* Dawn of Nemunas (part of the ruling coalition since 2024)
* Union of Democrats &quot;For Lithuania&quot; (part of the ruling coalition since 2024)

== Historical composition ==
==Speaker of the Parliament==
The sittings of the Seimas are presided over by the Speaker of the Seimas or a Deputy Speaker. The first sitting of the Seimas after an election is opened by the eldest member of the Seimas.

The Speaker of the Seimas represents the Seimas and directs its work. Under the legislative procedure, the Speaker submits the laws adopted by the Seimas to the President and may sign and proclaim the laws that are not signed or returned by the President in due time.

The Speaker of the Seimas may temporarily act as the President or deputise for President in cases where the President is abroad or is incapable to exercise the duties of the office. The Speaker of the Seimas, in such a situation, does not have the full powers of the President.

The Speaker of the Seimas and the Deputy Speakers are responsible to the Seimas for their activities, answering questions submitted by the members of the parliament. Under the Statute of the Seimas, the Speakers of the Seimas suspend membership in their political groups upon election.

Saulius Skvernelis is the current Speaker of the Seimas.

==Parliamentary operations==

The operations of the Seimas are primarily governed by the Constitution of Lithuania and the Statute of the Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania.

===Legislative procedure===
The right of legislative initiative in the Seimas belongs to the members of the Seimas, the President, and the Government. Citizens of Lithuania can also propose laws and proposals backed by at least 50 000 voters must be considered by the Seimas. The legislative procedure for proposed laws is regulated by the Statute of the Seimas.

All draft laws and proposals submitted to the Seimas, and any changes or supplements to previously submitted proposals must be registered with the Secretariat of the Seimas Sittings. The legal department of the Seimas then reviews the draft law, issuing a conclusion on whether or not the draft is in compliance with existing laws and the technical rules of law-making.

The draft laws are presented to the Seimas, which can vote to commence the procedure of consideration of the draft, postpone it or reject the draft. If the Seimas decides to commence the procedure of consideration, it appoints the principal and additional Committees to consider the draft law.

The Seimas Committees perform thorough analysis of the draft law, present it to interested state institutions and organizations, consult specialists in different fields and hear opinions on the draft. Interested persons can, at this stage, provide proposals and opinions on the draft.

The reports of the principal Committee and any other Committees are heard by the Seimas and a general discussion is held. A vote is taken on the amendments to the draft law, which can be proposed and presented by any person with the right of legislative initiative. Finally, the Seimas votes on whether to approve the draft law confirmed by the Committee together with amendments adopted at a sitting of the Seimas.

The adopted laws are submitted to the President. The President can return the law to the Seimas for additional consideration or sign it. Seimas can, but is not obliged to, take proposals by the President into account and can approve the laws returned by the President in a simple majority vote. If the President does not sign the law returned after additional consideration or neither signs nor returns the law after the initial submission, the Speaker of the Seimas can sign the law. The law comes into effect after being published in the &quot;Official Gazette&quot; (&quot;Valstybės žinios&quot;).

===Plenary sittings===
The Seimas meets annually in two regular sessions: a spring session (10 March – 30 June) and an autumn session (10 September – 23 December). Extraordinary sessions can be called by the Speaker of the Seimas upon the proposal of at least one third of all members of the Seimas, or, in some cases, by the President.

When the Seimas is in session, there are four plenary sittings of the Seimas per week: two on Tuesday and two on Thursday, which are presided by the Speaker of the Seimas or the Deputy Speaker. As a rule, the sittings of the Seimas are open to the public. The open sittings of the Seimas are also broadcast on cable television and via the internet.

The programmes for the sessions of the Seimas and the draft agendas of sittings are drafted and approved by the Assembly of the Elders, which is made up of the members of the Board of the Seimas and representatives of the parliamentary groups.

===Board of the Seimas===
The board of the Seimas consists of the Speaker of the Seimas, the Deputy Speakers, and the leader of the opposition. The Speaker and the Deputy 
Speakers are elected by the members of the parliament in session.

===Parliamentary committees===
Parliamentary committees are elected by the Seimas from among its members. The committees consider draft legislation and can explore and clarify other issues in their area of competence.

The committees are formed during the first session of the newly elected Seimas and can have between 7 and 17 members (with the exception of the Committee on European Affairs, which has at least 15 members). Members are selected based on proportional representation of parliamentary groups. Each committee elects its Chair and Deputy Chair, subject to approval by the Seimas.

==Seimas Palace==

The Seimas Palace () is the seat of the Seimas. It consists of three buildings in the center of Vilnius, at the end of Gediminas Avenue. The main building (I Seimas Palace) was designed by architects Algimantas Nasvytis and his brother Vytautas Nasvytis as the Palace of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR. Construction, at the site of a former stadium, started in 1976 and was completed in 1980. On March 11, 1990, the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania was proclaimed in the main hall of the building. The hall, now referred to as the Hall of the Act of 11 March, housed the sessions of the Seimas until 2007 and is now used for special occasions. The offices of most of the parliament members are also located in this building.

The two other buildings were built around the same time and were connected to the main building after the independence, as the demand for working space increased. The II Seimas Palace, close to Neris river, originally housed the Ministry of Finance of the Lithuanian SSR. After a renovation finished in 2007, the main chamber of the II Seimas Palace houses the sessions of the Seimas. The building also houses the Chancellery of the Seimas. The III Seimas Palace was originally occupied by the Council of the Center of Labour Unions and is now used by the Committees of the Seimas, also housing the restaurant and other administrative functions.

January events of 1991 are commemorated by fragments of the barricades and memorial signs around the Palace.

<text>Vouliagmeni (, meaning &quot;sunken&quot;) is a seaside suburb and former municipality 20 km south of Athens city centre. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Vari-Voula-Vouliagmeni, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 5.805 km2. Its population was 4,332 at the 2021 census. In 1993 and again in 2009, it hosted the annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group.
The suburb is named after Lake Vouliagmeni, located in its vicinity. It is one of the most prestigious Athenian suburbs, home to renowned hotels and beaches. The area has some of the highest real estate prices in the Balkans.

==Geography==

Vouliagmeni sits on the southwestern foot of the Hymettus mountain range. It is bisected by a palm tree lined boulevard, Athinas Avenue, which arrives from Athens city centre as Vouliagmenis Avenue, then runs parallel to the seashore and continues southwards. The area east of the main road is the rocky slope of a foothill of Mount Hymettus, and the bulk of the town is built there, along with the local elementary school, post office, banks and town hall.

The western half, located between Athinas Avenue and the sea, is covered with pine trees and consists of two peninsulas, Megalo and Mikro Kavouri (&quot;Big Crab&quot; and &quot;Little Crab&quot;) that feature sandy and pebble beaches in between rocky shores, luxury hotels (including the Astir Palace Hotel occupying most of Mikro Kavouri), the local high school, the picturesque chapel of &quot;St. George of the crab&quot;, two marinas, an aquatic sports club (the &quot;Nautical Club of Vouliagmeni&quot;, see below), a sports club (soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis) and upscale restaurants, taverns and cafeterias on the waterfront.

The Mikro Kavouri is connected to the mainland with a narrow, sandy isthmus commonly referred to as &quot;Laimos&quot; (λαιμός, i.e. the &quot;Neck&quot;), flanked by one public beach on one side and Astir Palace beach on the other side. The Megalo Kavouri is land largely owned by the Church of Greece, which maintains an enclosed, protected pine forest and an orphanage. An air force camp is also located there. Dotted with lavish villas, the two Kavouri areas are among the most expensive pieces of housing real estate in Greece.

The Vouliagmeni beaches are consistently awarded the coveted EU blue flags for environmental excellence. The triathlon competition for the 2004 Summer Olympics took place in this area. The small, rocky islet of Fleves lies off shore.

==History==

Ruins of the Temple of Apollo Zoster have been excavated and can be viewed inside the public Astir Hotel beach. According to legend, when Leto was about to give birth to Apollo and Artemis, she fled writhing in pain to Delos. During her flight she discarded her girdle, which fell on the Mikro Kavouri peninsula. When her son, the god Apollo, was born, he picked up the discarded girdle and girdled himself in honour of his mother, and was hence named &quot;Zoster&quot; (Girt). Other remnants of early human habitation found in Vouliagmeni include Neolithic and Bronze Age building foundations, and a 5th-century BC outpost. In classical times the area was the Athenian deme of Aixōnídes Halaí (), i.e. the Saltfields of Aixōnē (modern day Glyfada). The deme&#x27;s citizens were called Ἁλαεῖς, &quot;Halaeīs&quot;.

==Nautical Club of Vouliagmeni==

The Nautical Club of Vouliagmeni, or &quot;NOV&quot; (Greek: Ναυτικός Όμιλος Βουλιαγμένης, &quot;NOB&quot;) was founded by local sportsmen in 1937 and is located on the eastern edge of the Mikro Kavouri, adjacent to the Astir Palace Hotel and overlooking the bay, town and lake. The club admits members and their guests and operates a marina, a waterskiing school, junior and Olympic competition sailing boats and facilities, an open-air, heated swimming pool, two rocky beaches, members&#x27; indoor and outdoor lounges, a gym, and a restaurant. The pool hosts swimming, finswimming, synchronized swimming and water polo teams and the respective training schools for children. The women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s water polo teams are considered a traditional force in European water polo and have won many Greek and several European Championships and Cups. The club often hosts LEN Euroleague and LEN Cup tournaments, its star players consistently being capped for the Greece men&#x27;s national water polo team and Greece women&#x27;s national water polo team. The club crest depicts a blue anchor set inside a white lifebuoy with eight crimson stripes; blue, white and crimson being the club colors.

==Lake Vouliagmeni==
Immediately to the south of town and very close to the sea, a rare geological formation is to be found that gave the suburb its modern name: Lake Vouliagmeni (&quot;Sunken Lake&quot;), a small brackish-water lake fed by underground currents seeping through the mass of Mount Hymettus. Because of its comfortable water temperature, ranging from 22 to 29 °Celsius, the lake functions as a year-round spa.

==Historical population==
==Notable residents==

Greek businessperson Chrysanthos Panas was raised in Vouliagmeni.

Songwriter Bob Dylan stayed in Vouliagmeni in the summer of 1964 composing many of the ballads later recorded for Another Side of Bob Dylan.

World champion tennis player Stefanos Tsitsipas was raised in Vouliagmeni

<text>The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania () defines the legal foundation for all laws passed in the Republic of Lithuania. The first constitution of the contemporary republic was enacted on 1 August 1922. The current constitution was adopted in a referendum on 25 October 1992.

==History==

===Statutes of Lithuania===
The first attempt to codify the laws of Grand Duchy of Lithuania took the form of Statutes of Lithuania, with the First Statute in power in 1529. The document, written in Ruthenian language, fulfilled the role of the supreme law of the land, even including provisions that no other law could contradict it.

===Constitution of 3 May 1791===

In the 18th century the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a federal entity consisting of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, faced a period of decline due to increasingly dysfunctional internal politics. In a belated attempt to rectify the situation, a constitution was adopted on May 3, 1791 – one of the oldest codified national constitutions in the world.

The new constitution abolished the liberum veto and banned the szlachta&#x27;s confederations, features that had crippled decision making the state. The constitution also provided for a separation of powers among legislative, executive and judicial branches of government, established &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and extended political rights to the bourgeoisie. The peasantry saw their rights increased but it fell short of abolishing serfdom, which was reconfirmed. Religious tolerance was preserved, although the status of the Catholic faith was recognized.

Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations of 22 October 1791 accompanied the constitution, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania within a single state and their equal representation in state-governing bodies.

The 1791 document remained in force for less than 19 months; after a brief war with Russia, it was annulled by the Grodno Sejm on 23 November 1793. By 1795, the Commonwealth was partitioned between Russian Empire, Kingdom of Prussia and Habsburg Austria, with most of the lands of the Grand Duchy under the Russian rule.

===Interwar constitutions===

During the closing stages of World War I, Lithuania declared independence on 16 February 1918. Three separate temporary constitutions were enacted on 2 November 1918, 4 April 1919 and 10 June 1920.

On 2 November 1918, the State Council adopted a constitutional act. At the time, it was still constrained by the decision of 11 July 1918, declaring Lithuania a constitutional monarchy, with close ties to Germany. In a changing environment, the council chose to adopt the constitutional act without specifying the form of government or the head of state, leaving the decisions to the Constituent Assembly (Steigiamasis Seimas).

On 4 April 1919, the State Council adopted modified Fundamental Principles of Temporary Constitution. The modifications were mainly notable for the introduction of the office of the President, in place of the Presidium of the Council. Once assembled, the Constituent Assembly adopted another temporary constitutional act on 10 June 1920, confirming Lithuania as a parliamentary republic and providing the framework and limits to its own powers.

The first permanent constitution the Republic of Lithuania was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 1 August 1922. It was a democratic constitution and resembled contemporary Western European constitutions, enshrining the main rights and freedom of the people, political freedoms, political pluralism and a mechanism for democratic elections. The constitution envisioned a strong parliament (the Seimas) and a politically weakened president as the head of state.

A coup on 17 December 1926 started the process of transforming the Republic of Lithuania into an authoritarian state headed by Antanas Smetona as the President. The constitution of 1922 was disregarded as early as 12 April 1927, when the President dissolved the Seimas without announcing a new election. A constitutional reform was proposed, strengthening the authority of the President and weakening the parliament.

A new constitution was proclaimed by Smetona in May 1928 without any attempt to follow the procedure for changing the Constitution established in the 1922 document (which would have required the assent of the Seimas). Instead, the constitution was presented as a &quot;proposal&quot; to the nation, to be approved within 10 years, although this provision was not considered meaningful. The constitution maintained a parliament, but assigned all of its functions, such as enacting laws, ratifying treaties, as well as drafting and executing the budget, to the President when the parliament was not in session. The Seimas would not reconvene until 1936.

The constitution of 1928 was never submitted for approval to the nation. Instead, the government started working on a new constitution, approved by the newly assembled Seimas in 1938 (opposition was not allowed to stand for election). The constitution retained the overall authoritarian character of the 1928 document, and declared that the state was the foundation of existence of its citizens and not the other way round. The constitution did away with the separation of powers, stating that state power was &quot;undividable&quot; and led by the President, with the Seimas, Government and courts subordinate to him.

In 1940, Lithuania was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union. Ironically, the constitution of 1938 assisted the Soviets in legitimizing their actions by concentrating the power in the hands of the President, the post that was de facto taken over by Justas Paleckis. In 1940 and 1978, new constitutions of Lithuanian SSR were adopted, based on the Soviet constitutions of 1936 and 1977, respectively.

==Modern constitution==
===Onset===
On 11 March 1990, Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union, emphasizing restoration and the legal continuity of the interwar-period Republic of Lithuania. On the same day, the 1938 Constitution of Lithuania was restored for a brief period, but subsequently suspended and replaced with the Provisional Basic Law.

The Provisional Basic Law established a framework for the new state, guaranteeing democratic rights and establishing rules of democratic process. However, the government was structured similarly to its Soviet predecessor: legislative and executive functions were combined under the parliament (Supreme Council, ), and the judiciary branch was not independent. The government functions were performed by the presidium of the Supreme Council and the chairman of the presidium became the chairman of the parliament and the Head of State. It was a transitional system, as the Provisional Basic Law did not reflect the changing economic and social relations and the evolving demands of the society and the state. Also over one-third of the Law was amended in a period of two years.

Over the next two years, work on a new constitution was done, with independent drafts prepared in 1990 and 1991. At the end of 1991, the Supreme Council established a commission tasked to prepare a draft constitution. The resulting proposal was approved by the Supreme Council on 21 April 1992, and presented to the public. An alternative draft constitution was prepared by a coalition led by Sąjūdis. The main difference between the two proposals was the balance between the various branches of government. The proposal approved by the Supreme Council envisioned a parliamentary system, while the alternative proposal suggested a presidential model. The final document represented a compromise between a purely parliamentary system and a presidential one.

===Adoption===

The new constitution was approved by the Supreme Council in October 1992 and submitted to popular vote. The constitution was approved in a referendum on 25 October 1992. Seventy-five per cent of those voting (57% of all eligible voters) voted in favor of adopting the document, with a turnout of 75.3%.

===Contents===
The Constitution of 1992 reflects the combined influence of the institutions and experiences of Western democracies as well as the Lithuanian tradition. Introductory provisions of the document (Chapter I) contain the fundamental principles of the State, placing high value on democracy, but also asserting the collective and individual right of defence against attempts by force to encroach upon &quot;independence, territorial integrity, or constitutional order of the State&quot;. The provisions also disallow division of Lithuanian territory into any &quot;state derivatives&quot; — a reference to territorial autonomy as a solution to ethnic minority problems in the country. Article 150 of the constitution incorporates a constitutional act &quot;On the Non-Alignment of the Republic of Lithuania with Post-Soviet Eastern Alliances&quot;, effectively prohibiting the membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States and similar structures. The very same article includes &quot;The Constitutional Act of the Republic of Lithuania on membership of the Republic of Lithuania in the European Union&quot;, which recognises Lithuania as a member of the European Union.

Fundamental human rights and democratic values, including freedom of &quot;thought, faith, and conscience,&quot; are enshrined in the constitution, which also guarantees the status of legal person to religious denominations and allows religious teaching in public schools. In addition to personal, political, and religious rights, the constitution secures social rights. As already noted, these include free medical care, old-age pensions, unemployment compensation, and support for families and children.

==== Government ====

The power to govern is divided between the legislative and executive branches, with an independent judiciary acting as interpreter of the constitution and of the branches&#x27; jurisdictions, as well as arbiter of conflicts between them. The constitution clearly acknowledges the danger of concentration of power in a single person or institution. The legislature has regained its old name, Seimas, which was used in the interwar years. The executive consists of a president and a prime minister with a cabinet, known as the Government (executive only; Lithuanian: &quot;Vyriausybė&quot;). The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and subordinate courts (the Court of Appeals, district courts, and local courts). The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania, which decides on the constitutionality of acts of the Seimas, the President, and the Government, is an institution of the judiciary, completely independent from other courts. The Office of the Procurator General is an autonomous institution of the judiciary. Creation of special courts, such as administrative or family courts, is allowed, although establishing courts with &quot;special powers&quot; is forbidden in peacetime.

==== Parliament ====
The parliament of Lithuania is a unicameral legislature called the Seimas. The Seimas consists of 141 members, seventy elected from party lists on the basis of proportional representation and seventy-one from single-member districts. To be seated in the Seimas on the basis of proportional representation, a party must receive at least 5 per cent of the votes cast. The legislature is elected for four years. Candidates for the legislature must be at least twenty-five years old. Members of the Seimas may serve as prime ministers or Cabinet members, but they may not hold any other position in either central or local government or in private enterprises or organizations. The parliament must approve the prime minister and the cabinet, composed by the ministers — and also the prime minister, as well as their government programme. It also may force the government&#x27;s resignation by rejecting twice in sequence its programme or by voting, in a secret ballot, to express its lack of confidence in the government.

The powers of the legislature are checked by a number of devices: first, by certain constitutional limitations; second, by the president as defined under the constitution; and third, by the Constitutional Court. Articles 64, 131, and 132 of the constitution circumscribe the ability of the Seimas to control the Government, especially the budget. Article 64 specifies the times of parliamentary sessions. Although extension is possible, ordinarily the legislature cannot sit longer than seven months and three days, divided into two sessions. The budget submitted by the Government can be increased by the legislature only if the latter indicates the sources of financing for additional expenditures. If the budget is not approved before the start of the budget year, proposed expenditures cannot be higher than those of the previous year. Finally, the legislature is not entrusted with making decisions concerning the basic characteristics of Lithuanian statehood and democracy. These are left to the citizens by means of referendum. Similarly, the initiative for making laws is not limited to the legislature but also belongs to the citizens, who can force the legislature to consider a law by submitting a petition with 50,000 signatures.

==== President ====

The powers of the legislature are further checked by those of the president, who may veto legislation, both ordinary and constitutional, passed by the legislature. Laws are not promulgated without the signature of the President. A presidential veto can be overridden, but only by an absolute majority of the Seimas&#x27; membership. The President can also dissolve the Parliament if it refuses to approve the government&#x27;s budget within sixty days or if it directly votes no confidence in the government. However, the next elected Parliament may retaliate by calling for an earlier presidential election.

The president is directly elected by the people for a term of five years and a maximum of two consecutive terms. The president is not, strictly speaking, the sole chief of the executive branch or the chief administrator. The Lithuanians borrowed the French model of the presidency, then adapted it to their needs. Candidates must be at least forty years old. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must win more than half of the total votes cast, with 50 per cent of the electorate participating. If fewer than 50 percent of the electorate turns out, a candidate can win in the first round with a plurality if he or she wins at least one-third of the total vote. If the first round does not produce a president, a second round is held within two weeks between the two top candidates, in which a plurality is sufficient to win.

The president is the head of state. The president also selects the prime minister and names the Cabinet on his or her advice (the prime minister and their Cabinet are subject to approval by the Seimas), approves ministerial candidates, and appoints the commander-in-chief of the armed forces — with parliament&#x27;s consent. The President resolves basic foreign policy issues and can confer military and diplomatic ranks, appoint diplomats without legislative approval, and issue decrees subject to the legislature&#x27;s right to later overturn a decree by legislative action. Generally, the president has greater power in foreign policy than domestic policy.

Finally, the president has considerable powers to influence the judicial branch. The president has the right to nominate (and the Seimas to approve the nomination of) three justices to the Constitutional Court and all justices to the Supreme Court. The president also appoints, with legislative approval, judges of the Court of Appeals. However, the parliament&#x27;s consent is not required for the appointment or transfer of judges in local, district, and special courts.

==== Constitutional Court ====
The Constitutional Court checks both the legislative and the executive branches of government by ruling on whether their legislation and/or actions are constitutional. The court consists of nine justices appointed by the legislature, three each from the nominees of the president, the parliamentary chairman, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The president nominates the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court. Cases for consideration by the Constitutional Court, however, may be brought only by one-fifth of the membership of the Seimas, the ordinary courts, or the President of the Republic.

<text>The École Militaire (; &quot;military school&quot;) is a complex of buildings in Paris, France, which house various military training facilities. It was founded in 1751 by King Louis XV and is located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, southeast of the Champ de Mars.

The building, constructed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, is an active military academy and was classified as a national monument since 1990. This site can be visited during the European Heritage Days.

==History==
=== Origins of the Institution ===
L&#x27;École Militaire was founded in 1750, after the War of the Austrian Succession, by Louis XV on the basis of a proposal of Marshal Maurice de Saxe and with the support of Madame de Pompadour and financier Joseph Paris Duverney.

Previously, military academies were exclusive to children of a noble background and offered apprenticeships in the King&#x27;s Stables or the stables of other royal members. With the aim of creating an academic college for cadet officers from poor noble families, the exclusivity that royal military academies held vanished.

By the edict of January 1751, King Louis XV established the institution to provide education to five hundred young noblemen born without fortune. Article XI of the edict provides for &quot;by way of first perpetual endowment&quot; the tax on playing cards. The administration is entrusted to the Secretary of State for War. The Royal Military Academy included a number of military colleges in the province such as the School of Brienne where students were admitted on evidence of nobility. At the end of their schooling, admission to the Royal Military School in Paris was done through a national competition.

=== Architecture and Ange-Jacques Gabriel ===

Charged by King Louis XV to design a grander building than the Hôtel des Invalides (constructed by Louis XIV), Ange-Jacques Gabriel broke ground in 1752 on the farm of Grenelle. After years of construction, the school was opened in 1760. Gabriel presented an immense area with beautiful façades and water running through a network of wells and pipes. The entirety was indeed much larger and more striking than the Invalides.

The Comte de Saint-Germain reorganised the establishment in 1777 under the name of the &quot;École des Cadets-gentilshommes&quot; (&quot;School of Young Gentlemen&quot;), which accepted the young Napoleon Bonaparte in 1784. Bonaparte went on to graduate after only one year instead of the usual two.

The &quot;École&quot; now incorporates:
* The &quot;École de guerre&quot; (EdG) (School of Warfare)
* The &quot;Ecole de Guerre-Terre&quot; (EdG-T) (School of Land Warfare)
* The &quot;Institut des hautes études de défense nationale&quot; (Institute of Advanced Studies in National Defense)

In 2014, the top financial backers of the Independent Media Institute were Cloud Mountain Foundation, Craigslist Charitable Fund, Drug Policy Alliance, Madison Community Foundation, Nathan Cummings Foundation, New World Foundation, Panta Rhea Foundation, Park Foundation and Roseben Fund.

== History ==

=== Independent Media Institute ===
AlterNet was founded in the fall of 1987 by the Institute for Alternative Journalism (IAJ), which was incorporated in December 1983 with a mission to serve as a clearinghouse for important local stories generated by the members of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies (AAN). 

The founding editor of AlterNet was Alan Green, who with his deputy, Margaret Engle, created print and electronic mechanisms to syndicate both the works of AAN papers and freelance contributors, among them Michael Moore and Abbie Hoffman. Engle took over for Green in 1989 and ran the news service until 1993, in that time dramatically expanding AlterNet&#x27;s base of contributors and client newspapers. Upon her resignation, Engle was succeeded by Don Hazen, who had been hired by IAJ in 1991 to be its first executive director. AlterNet publishes a combination of policy critiques, investigative reports and analysis, grassroots success stories, and personal narratives. Christine Triano was associate director of the Institute for Alternative Journalism, in 1996.

&quot;Media Heroes&quot; are annual awards by the Institute for Alternative Journalism. Frederick Clarkson was named among the &quot;Media Heroes of 1992&quot; James Danky was named a Media Hero in 1993. In 1995, Media Heroes awards went to Public Media Center, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, Institute for Global Communications, Janine Jackson, Laura Flanders, CounterSpin, Gary Delgado, David Barsamian, Alternative Radio, Haiti Truth Team, Salim Muwakkil, John Schwartz, and Artists for a Hate Free America were presented in MediaCulture Review, January/February 1995 

In 1996, Leslie Savan was named one of &quot;The Top Ten Media Heroes&quot;. Patricia Scott, and Julie Drizin were named to the &quot;Top Ten Media Heroes of 1996&quot; Paul Klite, Executive Director of Rocky Mountain Media Watch, received a Media Hero Award from the Institute for Alternative Journalism in 1996. Amy Goodman, Bob Herbert, &quot;Detroit Sunday Journal&quot;, Gary Webb, Herbert Schiller, James Ridgeway, Karl Grossman, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Norman Solomon, and Urvashi Vaid received the 1997 Media Hero Award. In 1997, Media Heroes awards were presented at the second Media &amp; Democracy Congress. The Institute for Alternative Journalism named Barsamian one of its Top Ten Media Heroes.

The IAJ became the Independent Media Institute some time before December 1999. After the sale of AlterNet to the new company, AlterNet Media in April 2018, the Independent Media Institute (IMI) launched a series of new programs including the Make It Right Project.

===Acquisition===
On April 9, 2018, it was announced that AlterNet was acquired by owners of &quot;Raw Story&quot;, an online news organization, under the newly created company AlterNet Media. In an online statement, &quot;Raw Story&quot; founder John K. Byrne stated, &quot;AlterNet will continue to carry content from the Independent Media Institute, its prior owner. Thus, much of the content you expect will remain the same. You will see articles by former AlterNet writers appearing with the Independent Media Institute byline.&quot; AlterNet Media later acquired the New Civil Rights Movement.

==Staff==
=== Don Hazen ===
Don Hazen was hired by San Francisco&#x27;s Institute for Alternative Journalism in 1991 as its first executive director. The AlterNet editorial staff was headed by executive editor Hazen, a former publisher of &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, until December 2017 when he was placed on indefinite leave by the Independent Media Institute&#x27;s Board of Directors due to sexual harassment allegations. Following the allegations, Hazen resigned on 22 December 2017.

<text>A p–n junction is a combination of two types of semiconductor materials, p-type and n-type, in a single crystal. The &quot;n&quot; (negative) side contains freely-moving electrons, while the &quot;p&quot; (positive) side contains freely-moving electron holes. Connecting the two materials causes creation of a depletion region near the boundary, as the free electrons fill the available holes, which in turn allows electric current to pass through the junction only in one direction.

p–n junctions represent the simplest case of a semiconductor electronic device; a p-n junction by itself, when connected on both sides to a circuit, is a diode. More complex circuit components can be created by further combinations of p-type and n-type semiconductors; for example, the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a semiconductor in the form n–p–n or p–n–p. Combinations of such semiconductor devices on a single chip allow for the creation of integrated circuits.

Solar cells and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are essentially p-n junctions where the semiconductor materials are chosen, and the component&#x27;s geometry designed, to maximise the desired effect (light absorption or emission). A Schottky junction is a similar case to a p–n junction, where instead of an n-type semiconductor, a metal directly serves the role of the &quot;negative&quot; charge provider.

== History ==
The invention of the p–n junction is usually attributed to American physicist Russell Ohl of Bell Laboratories in 1939. Two years later (1941), Vadim Lashkaryov reported discovery of p–n junctions in Cu2O and silver sulphide photocells and selenium rectifiers. The modern theory of p-n junctions was elucidated by William Shockley in his classic work &quot;Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors&quot; (1950).

== Properties ==

A p-doped semiconductor (that is, one where impurities such as Boron are introduced into its crystal lattice) is relatively conductive. The same is true of an n-doped semiconductor, but the junction between them - the boundary where the p-doped and n-doped semiconductor materials meet - can become depleted of charge carriers such as electrons, depending on the relative voltages of the two semiconductor regions. 

By manipulating the flow of charge carriers across this depleted layer, p–n junctions can be used as diodes: circuit elements that allow a flow of electricity in one direction but not in the opposite direction. This property makes the p–n junction extremely useful in modern semiconductor electronics. 

&quot;Bias&quot; is the application of a voltage relative to a p–n junction region:
* &quot;Forward bias&quot; is in the direction in which current readily flows
* &quot;Reverse bias&quot; is in the direction of little or no current flow

Negative charge carriers (electrons) can easily flow through the junction from n to p but not from p to n, and the reverse is true for positive charge carriers (Electron hole). When the p–n junction is forward-biased, charge carriers flow freely due to the reduction in energy barriers seen by electrons and holes. When the p–n junction is reverse-biased, however, the junction barrier (and therefore resistance) becomes greater and charge flow is minimal.

=== Equilibrium (zero bias) ===
In a p–n junction, without an external applied voltage, an equilibrium condition is reached in which a potential difference forms across the junction. This potential difference is called &quot;built-in potential&quot; formula_1.

At the junction, some of the free electrons in the n-type wander into the p-type due to random thermal migration (&quot;diffusion&quot;). As they diffuse into the p-type they combine with electron holes, and cancel each other out. In a similar way, some of the positive holes in the p-type diffuse into the n-type and combine with free electrons and cancel each other out. The positively charged (&quot;donor&quot;) dopant atoms in the n-type are part of the crystal, and cannot move. Thus, in the n-type, a region near the junction has a fixed amount of positive charge. The negatively charged (&quot;acceptor&quot;) dopant atoms in the p-type are part of the crystal, and cannot move. Thus, in the p-type, a region near the junction becomes negatively charged. The result is a region near the junction that acts to repel the mobile charges away from the junction because of the electric field that these charged regions create. The region near the p–n interface loses electrical neutrality and most of its mobile carriers, forming the depletion layer (see figure A). The electric field created in the space charge then tends to counteract further diffusion, resulting in equilibrium.

The carrier concentration profile at equilibrium is shown in figure A with blue and red lines. Also shown are the two counterbalancing phenomena that establish equilibrium.

The space charge region is a zone with a net charge provided by the fixed ions (donors or acceptors) that have been left &quot;uncovered&quot; by majority carrier diffusion. When equilibrium is reached, the charge density is approximated by the displayed step function. In fact, since the y-axis of figure A is log-scale, the region is almost completely depleted of majority carriers (leaving a charge density equal to the net doping level), and the edge between the space charge region and the neutral region is quite sharp (see figure B, Q(x) graph). The space charge region has the same magnitude of charge on both sides of the p–n interfaces, thus it extends farther on the less doped side in this example (the n side in figures A and B).

=== Forward bias ===

In forward bias, the p-type is connected with a positive electrical terminal and the n-type is connected with a negative terminal. The panels show energy band diagram, electric field, and net charge density. The built-in potential of the semiconductor varies, depending on the concentration of doping atoms. In this example, both p and n junctions are doped at a 1e15 cm−3 (160 μC/cm3) doping level, leading to built-in potential of ~0.59 volts. Reducing depletion width can be inferred from the shrinking movement of carriers across the p–n junction, which as a consequence reduces electrical resistance. Electrons that cross the p–n junction into the p-type material (or holes that cross into the n-type material) diffuse into the nearby neutral region. The amount of minority diffusion in the near-neutral zones determines the amount of current that can flow through the diode.

Only majority carriers (electrons in n-type material or holes in p-type) can flow through a semiconductor for a macroscopic length. With this in mind, consider the flow of electrons across the junction. The forward bias causes a force on the electrons pushing them from the N side toward the P side. With forward bias, the depletion region is narrow enough that electrons can cross the junction and &quot;inject&quot; into the p-type material. However, they do not continue to flow through the p-type material indefinitely, because it is energetically favorable for them to recombine with holes. The average length an electron travels through the p-type material before recombining is called the &quot;diffusion length&quot;, and it is typically on the order of micrometers.

Although the electrons penetrate only a short distance into the p-type material, the electric current continues uninterrupted, because holes (the majority carriers) begin to flow in the opposite direction. The total current (the sum of the electron and hole currents) is constant in space, because any variation would cause charge buildup over time (this is Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law). The flow of holes from the p-type region into the n-type region is exactly analogous to the flow of electrons from N to P (electrons and holes swap roles and the signs of all currents and voltages are reversed).

Therefore, the macroscopic picture of the current flow through the diode involves electrons flowing through the n-type region toward the junction, holes flowing through the p-type region in the opposite direction toward the junction, and the two species of carriers constantly recombining in the vicinity of the junction. The electrons and holes travel in opposite directions, but they also have opposite charges, so the overall current is in the same direction on both sides of the diode, as required.

The Shockley diode equation models the forward-bias operational characteristics of a p–n junction outside the avalanche (reverse-biased conducting) region.

=== Reverse bias ===

Connecting the &quot;p-type&quot; region to the &quot;negative&quot; terminal of the voltage supply and the &quot;n-type&quot; region to the &quot;positive&quot; terminal corresponds to reverse bias. If a diode is reverse-biased, the voltage at the cathode is comparatively higher than at the anode. Therefore, very little current flows until the diode breaks down. The connections are illustrated in the adjacent diagram.

Because the p-type material is now connected to the negative terminal of the power supply, the &#x27;holes&#x27; in the p-type material are pulled away from the junction, leaving behind charged ions and causing the width of the depletion region to increase. Likewise, because the n-type region is connected to the positive terminal, the electrons are pulled away from the junction, with similar effect. This increases the voltage barrier causing a high resistance to the flow of charge carriers, thus allowing minimal electric current to cross the p–n junction. The increase in resistance of the p–n junction results in the junction behaving as an insulator.

The strength of the depletion zone electric field increases as the reverse-bias voltage increases. Once the electric field intensity increases beyond a critical level, the p–n junction depletion zone breaks down and current begins to flow, usually by either the Zener or the avalanche breakdown processes. Both of these breakdown processes are non-destructive and are reversible, as long as the amount of current flowing does not reach levels that cause the semiconductor material to overheat and cause thermal damage.

This effect is used to advantage in Zener diode regulator circuits. Zener diodes have a low breakdown voltage. A standard value for breakdown voltage is for instance 5.6 V. This means that the voltage at the cathode cannot be more than about 5.6 V higher than the voltage at the anode (though there is a slight rise with current), because the diode breaks down, and therefore conducts, if the voltage gets any higher. This effect limits the voltage over the diode.

Another application of reverse biasing is Varactor diodes, where the width of the depletion zone (controlled with the reverse bias voltage) changes the capacitance of the diode.

== Governing equations ==

=== Size of depletion region ===
For a p–n junction, let formula_2 be the concentration of negatively-charged acceptor atoms and formula_3 be the concentrations of positively-charged donor atoms. Let formula_4 and formula_5 be the equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes respectively. Thus, by Poisson&#x27;s equation:

formula_6

where formula_7 is the electric potential, formula_8 is the charge density, formula_9 is permittivity and
formula_10 is the magnitude of the electron charge.

For a general case, the dopants have a concentration profile that varies with depth x, but for a simple case of an abrupt junction, formula_11 can be assumed to be constant on the p side of the junction and zero on the n side, and formula_12 can be assumed to be constant on the n side of the junction and zero on the p side. Let formula_13 be the width of the depletion region on the p-side and formula_14 the width of the depletion region on the n-side. Then, since formula_15 within the depletion region, it must be that

formula_16

because the total charge on the p and the n side of the depletion region sums to zero. Therefore, letting formula_17 and formula_18 represent the entire depletion region and the potential difference across it,
formula_19

And thus, letting formula_20 be the total width of the depletion region, we get
formula_21

formula_18 can be written as formula_23, where we have broken up the voltage difference into the equilibrium plus external components. The equilibrium potential results from diffusion forces, and thus we can calculate formula_24 by implementing the Einstein relation and assuming the semiconductor is nondegenerate (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the product formula_25 is independent of the Fermi energy):
formula_26
where &quot;T&quot; is the temperature of the semiconductor and &quot;k&quot; is Boltzmann constant.

=== Current across depletion region ===
The &quot;Shockley ideal diode equation&quot; characterizes the current across a p–n junction as a function of external voltage and ambient conditions (temperature, choice of semiconductor, etc.). To see how it can be derived, we must examine the various reasons for current. The convention is that the forward (+) direction be pointed against the diode&#x27;s built-in potential gradient at equilibrium.

<text>Isle of Grain (Old English &quot;Greon&quot;, meaning gravel) is a village and the easternmost point of the Hoo Peninsula within the district of Medway in Kent, south-east England. Once an island and now forming part of the peninsula, the area is almost all marshland and is a major habitat for diverse wetland birds. The village constitutes a civil parish, which at the 2011 census had a population of 1,648, a net decrease of 83 people in 10 years.

== History ==


Extract from the &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; by John Gorton, 1833:
&quot;GRAINE, ISLE OF, co. Kent&quot;
&quot;A parish in the Hundred of Hoo, lathe of Aylesford, opposite to Sheppey at the mouth of the Thames; it is about three miles and a half long, and two and a half broad and is formed by Yantlet Creek running from the Medway to the Thames. The Creek was filled up, and had a road across it for 40 years until 1823, when the Lord Mayor ordered it to be again reopened, so as to give about eight feet navigation for barges at spring tide; thus saving a distance of fourteen miles into the Medway, and avoiding the danger of going round by the Nore.&quot;

The severing of the road resulted in an inconclusive High Court case in 1824, and by 1835 the causeway had been reinstated. The goods route from the Medway Towns to the upper Thames Estuary was later shortened by the Thames and Medway Canal, although this route, too, was abandoned.

In various warm years the incidence of &quot;marsh fever&quot; (malaria) was extremely high. Since the removal of livestock from marshy areas, the number of native mosquitoes has greatly declined, and Britain&#x27;s last recorded outbreak of malaria was in 1918.

Yantlet Creek at the south of the Yantlet Line was the downstream limit of the City of London&#x27;s ownership of the bed of the River Thames. It is marked by a London Stone beside the mouth of the creek. Its successor for navigation purposes, the Port of London Authority, also owns the river bed down to here but has navigation policing rights on a debatable area of estuary or sea as far as the seaside resort of Margate which has normal sea salinity.

Grain Tower, a fort about a quarter of a mile off-shore and accessible at low tide, was completed in 1855. Concrete emplacements and shelters were added during the World Wars when the tower, in addition to mounting guns, was used as a boom control point. The boom was a chain supporting antisubmarine nets across the two rivers, preventing entry by German U-boats. The tower was decommissioned in 1956.

The Isle of Grain was also the site of Grain Fort, built in the 1860s and used for coastal defence until the 1950s. The fort was almost completely demolished about 1960, leaving only the original earth rampart, complete with some tunnels running underground. 


Until 1982 the south of the Isle was home to a major oil refinery. Construction of this facility for BP took from 1948 to 1952, and it suffered flooding almost immediately when the North Sea flood of 1953 breached the sea wall.

In the 1990s the refinery site was chosen for a purpose-built facility to make concrete lining segments for the Channel Tunnel. There was not the space to make the sections at the Shakespeare Cliff construction site near Folkestone at the tunnel&#x27;s entrance, so the Isle of Grain was used because large quantities of granite aggregate could be delivered there by ship from Glensanda in Scotland, and the finished sections could then be transported by a pre-existing rail link to east Kent. Following completion of the Channel Tunnel, the site is now part-occupied by London Thamesport, the UK&#x27;s third largest container port. The remainder is allocated for industrial and warehousing use under the Thames Gateway project.

Next to the former BP site is Grain Power Station, built in the 1970s, which previously burnt oil. It was mothballed in 2003, but reopened in 2006 to provide up to three per cent of the National Grid supply. The oil-fired power station was demolished in 2015 and a new gas-fired station now stands on the site. Another major installation is a new Grain Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) import facility.

The Isle of Grain is the landing point for the BritNed undersea power cable between The Netherlands and the UK. It will also be the landing point for the NeuConnect interconnector linking the UK to Germany, planned for completion in 2028.

== Settlements ==

An 1801 map shows that the ancient village of Grain was at one time called &quot;St James in the Isle of Grain&quot;. Like others in the Hundred of Hoo, the village was named after the dedication of its parish church; for example Allhallows (All Saints), St Mary Hoo, Hoo St Werburgh.

Wallend is the other settlement, now uninhabited and contained within a fenced-off industrial site. The Medway Power Station now occupies the site.

== Port Victoria ==
Local historian Alan Bignell gives this description of the new port and accompanying railway:
In the late 1870s the South Eastern Railway decided to promote a line through the (Hoo) district, with a view to competing for the traffic from London to Sheerness, formerly an almost unchallenged stronghold of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. For some years past a steamer had been running from Sheerness to Strood, whence South Eastern trains gave a connection to London. ... the journey was of some length, along the rather tortuous course of the Medway. In 1879 the South Eastern obtained an act for a branch leaving their North Kent line at a point about (3.5 miles) from Gravesend ... to Stoke ... In the following year powers were obtained for an extension, (3.5 miles) long, to St James, in the Isle of Grain, where a deep-water pier was to be built on the Medway. A ferry was to connect the new pier with Sheerness ...

The railway was opened throughout on 11 September 1882. The pier was built for passenger traffic and Queen Victoria was a passenger. Bignell records that she &quot;... took a rather curious fancy to Grain as a chosen departure point for trips to Germany&quot; and there are claims that Port Victoria &quot;was built essentially as a railway station at the end of a line from Windsor&quot;.

The project was not a success and the ferry service was withdrawn in 1901, and the pier upon which the station was located fell into disuse by 1931, with the station moving to a new site just inland. It was closed completely in 1951, and the of line taken up. The site is now occupied by industry, though the foundations of the pier are still visible at low tide to this day and are clearly visible on aerial photographs of the area at coordinates .

From about 1912 an airship station, RNAS Kingsnorth was positioned at Grain by the Admiralty. From the beginning of World War I regular patrols were made along the Thames estuary from this station, as part of English Channel defences. In 1914 Port Victoria housed a Royal Navy aircraft repair depot adjacent to the station. Activities at these bases declined after 1918, until in 1924 defence cuts saw their closure. The site is now occupied by Kingsnorth Power Station.

But soon the course of the ship opens the entrance of the Medway, with its men-of-war moored in line, and the long wooden jetty of Port Victoria, with its few low buildings like the beginning of a hasty settlement upon a wild and unexplored shore. The famous Thames barges sit in brown clusters upon the water with an effect of birds floating upon a pond. —Joseph Conrad, 

== Airport proposal ==
A suggestion in 2003 to site a new London international airport to lie just west of Grain aroused a lot of local opposition, as well as from environmental groups such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.

In November 2011 architects Foster &amp; Partners published proposals to expand the transport system of South East England. These, called the Thames Hub, would include building a new four-runway airport on the Isle of Grain, partially on land reclaimed from the estuary. This plan was controversial. On 13 April 2012, Richard Deakin, the head of National Air Traffic Services, commented that &quot;the very worst spot you could put an airport is just about here ... We&#x27;re a little surprised that none of the architects thought it worthwhile to have a little chat.&quot;

In an interim report on 17 December 2013, the Airports Commission shortlisted three options. Grain was not among them. The Commission&#x27;s final recommendations were released in July 2015. These stated that a Grain airport &quot;had substantial disadvantages that collectively outweighed potential benefits&quot;, and the proposal was then abandoned.

== Sport ==
On 16 June 1857 the Isle was the site of a heavyweight championship prize-fight between William Perry (known as the Tipton Slasher) and Tom Sayers. The fight was won by Sayers who claimed the title of heavyweight champion of England.

<text>Lubusz Land (; ) is a historical region and cultural landscape in Poland and Germany on both sides of the Oder river.

Originally the settlement area of the Lechites, the swampy area was located east of Brandenburg and west of Greater Poland, south of Pomerania and north of Silesia and Lower Lusatia. Presently its eastern part lies within the Polish Lubusz Voivodeship, the western part with its historical capital Lebus (Lubusz) in the German state of Brandenburg.

== History==

=== Kingdom of Poland ===

When in 928 King Henry I of Germany crossed the Elbe river to conquer the lands of the Veleti, he did not subdue the Leubuzzi people settling beyond the Spree. Their territory was either already inherited by the first Polish ruler Mieszko I (~960-992) or conquered by him in the early period of his rule. After Mieszkos&#x27; death the whole country was inherited by his son Duke, and later King, Bolesław I the Brave. After the German Northern March got lost in a 983 Slavic rebellion, Duke Bolesław and King Otto III of Germany in 991 agreed at Quedlinburg to jointly conquer the remaining Lutician territory, Otto coming from the west and Bolesław starting from Lubusz in the east. However, they did not succeed. Instead Otto&#x27;s successor King Henry II of Germany in the rising conflict over the adjacent Lusatian march concluded an alliance with the Lutici and repeatedly attacked Bolesław.

Lubusz Land remained under Polish control even after King Mieszko II Lambert in 1031 finally had to withdraw from the adjacent, just conquered March of Lusatia and accept the overlordship of Emperor Conrad II. In 1125 Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland established the Bishopric of Lubusz to secure Lubusz Land. 1124-1125 records note that the new Bishop of Lubusz was nominated by Duke Bolesław under the Archbishopric of Gniezno. However, from the beginning Gniezno&#x27;s role as metropolia of the Lubusz diocese was challenged by the claims of the mighty Archbishops of Magdeburg, who also tried to make Lebus their suffragan. The Polish position was decisively enfeebled by the process of fragmentation after the death of Duke Bolesław III in 1138, when Lubusz Land became part of the Duchy of Silesia. The Duchy of Silesia was restored to the descendants of Władysław II the Exile in 1163, and Lubusz Land together with Lower Silesia was given to his eldest son Bolesław I the Tall.
In the 13th century Polish dukes in order to help develop Lubusz Land, granted some areas to different Catholic religious orders, such as the Cistercians, Canons Regular and Knights Templar. Among those orders possessions were Łagów, Chwarszczany, Lubiąż (today&#x27;s &quot;Müncheberg&quot;) and Dębno.

Lubusz remained under the rule of the Silesian Piasts, though Bolesław&#x27;s son Duke Henry I the Bearded in 1206 signed an agreement with Duke Władysław III Spindleshanks of Greater Poland to swap it for the Kalisz Region. This agreement however did not last as it provoked the revolt of Władysław&#x27;s nephew Władysław Odonic, while in addition the Lusatian margrave Conrad II of Landsberg took this occasion to invade Lubusz. Duke Henry I appealed to Emperor Otto IV and already started an armed expedition, until he was once again able to secure his possession of the region after Margrave Conrad had died in 1210. Nevertheless, the resistance against the Imperial expansion waned as the Silesian territories were again fragmented after the death of Duke Henry II the Pious at the Battle of Legnica in 1241. His younger son Mieszko then held the title of a &quot;Duke of Lubusz&quot;, but died only one year later, after which his territory fell to his elder brother Bolesław II the Bald. In 1248 Bolesław II, then Duke of Legnica, finally sold Lubusz to Magdeburg&#x27;s Archbishop Wilbrand von Käfernburg and the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg in 1249, wielding the secular reign.

=== March of Brandenburg and Kingdom of Bohemia ===

As to secular rule Lubusz Land was finally separated from Silesia, according to canon law however, the Lubusz diocese, comprising most of Lubusz Land, remained subordinate to the Gniezno metropolis. Meanwhile, the Brandenburg margraves forwarded the incorporation of Lubusz Land into their New March, created and expanded further to the northeast after the acquisition of the Santok castellany in 1296 on the forest areas between the Duchy of Pomerania and Greater Poland.

The Lebus bishops tried to maintain their affiliation with Poland and in 1276 therefore moved their residence east of the Oder river to Górzyca (Göritz upon Oder), an episcopal fief. When in 1319 the Brandenburg House of Ascania became extinct, the Lubusz Land became the subject of rivalry between the Piasts (duchies of Jawor and Żagań), Griffins (Duchy of Pomerania) and the Ascanians (Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg). In 1319, the region was captured by Wartislaw IV, Duke of Pomerania, in 1320 a large portion passed to Duke Henry I of Jawor, who tried to reclaim the Lubusz Land as region lost by his grandfather Bolesław II the Horned, later that year the western part was conquered by Rudolf I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg, and the eastern outskirts with Torzym were controlled by Duke Henry IV the Faithful of Żagań by 1322. In 1322–1323, there were heavy fights between Pomerania and Saxe-Wittenberg in the northern part of the region, around Kostrzyn nad Odrą.

After the Battle of Mühldorf, the House of Wittelsbach took an interest in the region in 1323, and King Louis IV the Bavarian decided to grant the Margraviate of Brandenburg with the Lubusz Land to his son Louis V. The emergence of a new powerful rival prompted the previously warring parties to make peace with each other and cooperate. Bavarian forces soon entered the region, but in October 1323 Pope John XXII called Louis IV to annul the grant of Brandenburg to Louis V, declaring it unlawful. The Pope supported the dukes of Pomerania and Głogów and local bishop Stephen II, and urged the region&#x27;s inhabitants to resist the Wittelsbachs. King Władysław I the Elbow-high of Poland also took the chance, allied with Bishop Stephen II and campaigned the Lubusz Land. In return the head of secular government in Lubusz, governor Erich of Wulkow, loyal to the new Brandenburg margrave Louis V, raided and captured the episcopal possessions in 1325, burning down the Górzyca cathedral. Bishop Stephen fled to Poland.

In 1354 Bishop Henry Bentsch reconciled with Margrave Louis II and the episcopal possessions were returned. The see of the bishopric returned to Lebus, where a new cathedral was built. In 1373 the diocese was again devastated by a Bohemian army, when Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg took the Brandenburg margraviate from the House of Wittelsbach. It became part of the Lands of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown. The see of the bishopric now moved to Fürstenwalde (Przybór) (St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Fürstenwalde). Polish monarchs still made peaceful attempts to regain the region. The northern part of the diocese of Lubusz, the Kostrzyn land, administratively became part of the New March, a peripheral region for Czech rulers who were willing to sell it. In 1402, an agreement was reached in Kraków between them and the Poles, under which Poland was purchase and reincorporate this region, however in the same year the Luxembourgs sold the region to the Teutonic Knights, Poland&#x27;s arch-enemy. In 1454, after the Thirteen Years’ War broke out, the Teutonic Knights sold the region to Brandenburg in order to raise funds for war against Poland. The bulk of the Lubusz Land remained part of the Bohemian (Czech) lands until 1415.

In 1424 the Lebus bishopric became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Magdeburg, finally leaving the Gniezno ecclesiastical province. In 1432, the Czech Hussites captured the city of Frankfurt (Oder). In 1518 Bishop Dietrich von Bülow bought the secular lordship of Beeskow-Storkow, in secular respect a Bohemian fief, in religious respect mostly no part of his diocese but of the Diocese of Meissen. The castle in Beeskow became the episcopal residence. The last Catholic bishop was Georg von Blumenthal, who died in 1550 after a heroic non-military counter-reformatory campaign. However, when in 1547 Bishop Georg tried to recruit and arm troops in order to join the Catholic Imperial forces in the Smalkaldic War, his vassal city of Beeskow refused to obey.

From 1555 the bishopric was secularised and became a Lutheran diocese and the area east of the Oder was later called Eastern Brandenburg. In 1575 King Maximilian II of Bohemia granted the Beeskow lordship of the Lebus diocese to Brandenburg as a Bohemian fief, which it remained until the First Silesian War in 1742. When in 1598 the Magdeburg administrator Joachim Frederick of Hohenzollern became Elector of Brandenburg, all official links with Poland had long been cut.

In the 16th century, many Polish exports, including grain, wood, ash, tar and hemp, were floated from western Poland via Frankfurt (Oder) in Lubusz Land to the port of Szczecin, with the high Brandenburgian customs duties on Polish goods lowered in the early 17th century.

=== Prussia and Germany ===

But new links to Poland developed, because since 1618 the prince-electors of Brandenburg ruled the Duchy of Prussia, then a Polish vassal state, in personal union. In 1657 Prussia gained sovereignty, so in 1701 the electors could upgrade their simultaneously held Prussian dukedom to the Kingdom of Prussia, dropping the title of elector of the Holy Roman Empire at its dissolution in 1806. In 1815 the kingdom joined the German Confederation, in 1866 the North German Confederation, which enlarged in 1871 to united Germany.

By the 17th century most of the population, consisting of autochthon Poles and German settlers, had mingled and assimilated to German language.

One of the main escape routes for insurgents of the unsuccessful Polish November Uprising from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through the region.

During World War I, a German strict regime prisoner-of-war camp for French, Russian, Belgian, British and Canadian officers was operated in Kostrzyn. Notable inmates included Leefe Robinson, Jocelyn Lee Hardy, Roland Garros and Jules Bastin, who all made unsuccessful escape attempts. It is considered the only German POW camp of World War I from which no one managed to escape.

====World War II====

The &quot;Einsatzgruppe VI&quot; was formed in Frankfurt (Oder) before it entered several Polish cities, including Poznań, Kalisz and Leszno, to commit various crimes against Poles during the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II. During the war, the Germans operated the Stalag III-C prisoner-of-war camp for Polish, French, Serbian, Soviet, Italian, British, American and Belgian POWs in the region, and numerous forced labour camps, including several subcamps of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, whose prisoners were Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, Norwegians, French, Belgians, Germans, Jews and Dutch. Particularly infamous camps were the Oderblick labor education camp in Świecko and the Sonnenburg concentration camp in Słońsk, in which Polish, Belgian, French, Bulgarian, Dutch, Yugoslav, Russian, Italian, Ukrainian, Luxembourgish, Danish, Norwegian, Czech, Slovak and other prisoners were held, and many died.

In early 1945, the death marches of prisoners of various nationalities from the dissolved camps in Świecko and Żabikowo to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp passed through the region. On 30–31 January, the SS and Gestapo perpetrated a massacre of over 800 prisoners of the Sonnenburg concentration camp.

Lubusz Land was the site of fierce fighting on the Eastern Front of World War II in 1945. In February and March the battle for Kostrzyn nad Odrą (then &quot;Küstrin&quot;) was fought, which resulted in 95% of the town being destroyed, making it the most destructed town of post-war Poland. Shortly after the liberation of the Stalag III-C POW camp in Kostrzyn, Soviet troops killed some American POWs mistaking them for German troops. In April the Battle of the Seelow Heights took place, ending in a Soviet-Polish victory. It was one of the last battles before the capitulation of Nazi Germany and the end of World War II in Europe.

=== In Poland and Germany ===

The portion of Lubusz Land east of the Oder River became again part of Poland by the 1945 Potsdam Conference, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the 1980s, whereas the western portion with the historical capital Lebus remained under Soviet occupation and became a part of communist East Germany in 1949.

Polish and Soviet authorities expelled most of the German population from the Polish annexed part of Lubusz Land in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Refugees who had fled before the Soviet forces were prevented from returning to their homes. The area was then resettled with Poles expelled from Soviet-annexed eastern Poland and migrants from central Poland. The largest cities and capitals of the Polish Lubusz Voivodeship today are Zielona Góra and Gorzów Wielkopolski, which however were not part of the historical Lubusz Land (cf. map above), but were parts of Lower Silesia and Greater Poland (the Santok castellany) respectively. Today, the largest town of Lubusz Land is Frankfurt (Oder), located in the German part of the region. On the Polish side the largest town is Kostrzyn nad Odrą. The region&#x27;s historic capital, Lebus, is one of the smallest towns.

In the Polish part of the Lubusz Land, in Słubice, the Wikipedia Monument, world&#x27;s first monument dedicated to the Wikipedia community, was unveiled in 2014.

<text>A Bayer filter mosaic is a color filter array (CFA) for arranging RGB color filters on a square grid of photosensors. Its particular arrangement of color filters is used in most single-chip digital image sensors used in digital cameras, and camcorders to create a color image. The filter pattern is half green, one quarter red and one quarter blue, hence is also called BGGR, RGBG, GRBG, or RGGB.

It is named after its inventor, Bryce Bayer of Eastman Kodak. Bayer is also known for his recursively defined matrix used in ordered dithering.

Alternatives to the Bayer filter include both various modifications of colors and arrangement and completely different technologies, such as color co-site sampling, the Foveon X3 sensor, the dichroic mirrors or a transparent diffractive-filter array.

==Explanation==

Bryce Bayer&#x27;s patent (U.S. Patent No. 3,971,065) in 1976 called the green photosensors &quot;luminance-sensitive elements&quot; and the red and blue ones &quot;chrominance-sensitive elements&quot;. He used twice as many green elements as red or blue to mimic the physiology of the human eye. The luminance perception of the human retina uses M and L cone cells combined, during daylight vision, which are most sensitive to green light. These elements are referred to as &quot;sensor elements&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;pixel sensors&quot;, or simply &quot;pixels&quot;; sample values sensed by them, after interpolation, become image pixels. At the time Bayer registered his patent, he also proposed to use a cyan-magenta-yellow combination, that is another set of opposite colors. This arrangement was impractical at the time because the necessary dyes did not exist, but is used in some new digital cameras. The big advantage of the new CMY dyes is that they have an improved light absorption characteristic; that is, their quantum efficiency is higher.

The raw output of Bayer-filter cameras is referred to as a &quot;Bayer pattern&quot; image. Since each pixel is filtered to record only one of three colors, the data from each pixel cannot fully specify each of the red, green, and blue values on its own. To obtain a full-color image, various demosaicing algorithms can be used to interpolate a set of complete red, green, and blue values for each pixel. These algorithms make use of the surrounding pixels of the corresponding colors to estimate the values for a particular pixel.

Different algorithms requiring various amounts of computing power result in varying-quality final images. This can be done in-camera, producing a JPEG or TIFF image, or outside the camera using the raw data directly from the sensor. Since the processing power of the camera processor is limited, many photographers prefer to do these operations manually on a personal computer. The cheaper the camera, the fewer opportunities to influence these functions. In professional cameras, image correction functions are completely absent, or they can be turned off. Recording in Raw-format provides the ability to manually select demosaicing algorithm and control the transformation parameters, which is used not only in consumer photography but also in solving various technical and photometric problems.

==Demosaicing==
Demosaicing can be performed in different ways. Simple methods interpolate the color value of the pixels of the same color in the neighborhood. For example, once the chip has been exposed to an image, each pixel can be read. A pixel with a green filter provides an exact measurement of the green component. The red and blue components for this pixel are obtained from the neighbors. For a green pixel, two red neighbors can be interpolated to yield the red value, also two blue pixels can be interpolated to yield the blue value.

This simple approach works well in areas with constant color or smooth gradients, but it can cause artifacts such as color bleeding in areas where there are abrupt changes in color or brightness especially noticeable along sharp edges in the image. Because of this, other demosaicing methods attempt to identify high-contrast edges and only interpolate along these edges, but not across them.

Other algorithms are based on the assumption that the color of an area in the image is relatively constant even under changing light conditions, so that the color channels are highly correlated with each other. Therefore, the green channel is interpolated at first then the red and afterwards the blue channel, so that the color ratio red-green respective blue-green are constant. There are other methods that make different assumptions about the image content and starting from this attempt to calculate the missing color values.

==Artifacts==

Images with small-scale detail close to the resolution limit of the digital sensor can be a problem to the demosaicing algorithm, producing a result which does not look like the model. The most frequent artifact is Moiré, which may appear as repeating patterns, color artifacts or pixels arranged in an unrealistic maze-like pattern.

===False color artifact===
A common and unfortunate artifact of Color Filter Array (CFA) interpolation or demosaicing is what is known and seen as false coloring. Typically this artifact manifests itself along edges, where abrupt or unnatural shifts in color occur as a result of misinterpolating across, rather than along, an edge. Various methods exist for preventing and removing this false coloring. Smooth hue transition interpolation is used during the demosaicing to prevent false colors from manifesting themselves in the final image. However, there are other algorithms that can remove false colors after demosaicing. These have the benefit of removing false coloring artifacts from the image while using a more robust demosaicing algorithm for interpolating the red and blue color planes.
===Zippering artifact===
The zippering artifact is another side effect of CFA demosaicing, which also occurs primarily along edges, is known as the zipper effect. Simply put, zippering is another name for edge blurring that occurs in an on/off pattern along an edge. This effect occurs when the demosaicing algorithm averages pixel values over an edge, especially in the red and blue planes, resulting in its characteristic blur. As mentioned before, the best methods for preventing this effect are the various algorithms which interpolate along, rather than across image edges. Pattern recognition interpolation, adaptive color plane interpolation, and directionally weighted interpolation all attempt to prevent zippering by interpolating along edges detected in the image. 
However, even with a theoretically perfect sensor that could capture and distinguish all colors at each photosite, Moiré and other artifacts could still appear. This is an unavoidable consequence of any system that samples an otherwise continuous signal at discrete intervals or locations. For this reason, most photographic digital sensors incorporate something called an optical low-pass filter (OLPF) or an anti-aliasing (AA) filter. This is typically a thin layer directly in front of the sensor, and works by effectively blurring any potentially problematic details that are finer than the resolution of the sensor.

==Modifications==
The Bayer filter is almost universal on consumer digital cameras. Alternatives include the CYGM filter (cyan, yellow, green, magenta) and RGBE filter (red, green, blue, emerald), which require similar demosaicing. The Foveon X3 sensor (which layers red, green, and blue sensors vertically rather than using a mosaic) and arrangements of three separate CCDs (one for each color) doesn&#x27;t need demosaicing.
===Panchromatic cells===

On June 14, 2007, Eastman Kodak announced an alternative to the Bayer filter: a colour-filter pattern that increases the sensitivity to light of the image sensor in a digital camera by using some panchromatic cells that are sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light and collect a larger amount of light striking the sensor. They present several patterns, but none with a repeating unit as small as the Bayer pattern&#x27;s 2×2 unit.
Another 2007 U.S. patent filing, by Edward T. Chang, claims a sensor where &quot;the color filter has a pattern comprising 2×2 blocks of pixels composed of one red, one blue, one green and one transparent pixel,&quot; in a configuration intended to include infrared sensitivity for higher overall sensitivity. The Kodak patent filing was earlier.

Such cells have previously been used in &quot;CMYW&quot; (cyan, magenta, yellow, and white) &quot;RGBW&quot; (red, green, blue, white) sensors, but Kodak has not compared the new filter pattern to them yet.
===Fujifilm &quot;EXR&quot; color filter array===
Fujifilm&#x27;s EXR color filter array are manufactured in both CCD (SuperCCD) and CMOS (BSI CMOS). As with the SuperCCD, the filter itself is rotated 45 degrees. Unlike conventional Bayer filter designs, there are always two adjacent photosites detecting the same color. The main reason for this type of array is to contribute to pixel &quot;binning&quot;, where two adjacent photosites can be merged, making the sensor itself more &quot;sensitive&quot; to light. Another reason is for the sensor to record two different exposures, which is then merged to produce an image with greater dynamic range. The underlying circuitry has two read-out channels that take their information from alternate rows of the sensor. The result is that it can act like two interleaved sensors, with different exposure times for each half of the photosites. Half of the photosites can be intentionally underexposed so that they fully capture the brighter areas of the scene. This retained highlight information can then be blended in with the output from the other half of the sensor that is recording a &#x27;full&#x27; exposure, again making use of the close spacing of similarly colored photosites.
===Fujifilm &quot;X-Trans&quot; filter===
The Fujifilm X-Trans CMOS sensor used in many Fujifilm X-series cameras is claimed to provide better resistance to color moiré than the Bayer filter, and as such they can be made without an anti-aliasing filter. This in turn allows cameras using the sensor to achieve a higher resolution with the same megapixel count. Also, the new design is claimed to reduce the incidence of false colors, by having red, blue and green pixels in each line. The arrangement of these pixels is also said to provide grain more like film.

One of main drawbacks for custom patterns is that they may lack full support in third party raw processing software like Adobe Photoshop Lightroom where adding improvements took multiple years.

=== Quad Bayer ===
Sony introduced Quad Bayer color filter array, which first featured in the iPhone 6&#x27;s front camera released in 2014. Quad Bayer is similar to Bayer filter, however adjacent 2x2 pixels are the same color, the 4x4 pattern features 4x blue, 4x red, and 8x green. For darker scenes, signal processing can combine data from each 2x2 group, essentially like a larger pixel. For brighter scenes, signal processing can convert the Quad Bayer into a conventional Bayer filter to achieve higher resolution. The pixels in Quad Bayer can be operated in long-time integration and short-time integration to achieve single shot HDR, reducing blending issues. Quad Bayer is also known as Tetracell by Samsung, 4-cell by OmniVision, and Quad CFA (QCFA) by Qualcomm.

On March 26, 2019, the Huawei P30 series were announced featuring RYYB Quad Bayer, with the 4x4 pattern featuring 4x blue, 4x red, and 8x yellow.

=== Nonacell ===

On February 12, 2020, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra was announced featuring Nonacell CFA. Nonacell CFA is similar to Bayer filter, however adjacent 3x3 pixels are the same color, the 6x6 pattern features 9x blue, 9x red, and 18x green.

<doc id="571763" wikidata="Q652348" url="?curid=571763" title="Grey-headed gull">
<text>The grey-headed gull (Chroicocephalus cirrocephalus), also known as the grey-hooded gull, is a small species of gull which breeds patchily in South America and Africa south of the Sahara. It is not truly migratory, but is dispersive, becoming more widespread in winter. This species has occurred as a rare vagrant to the United States, Italy, and Spain. As is the case with many gulls, it had traditionally been placed in the genus &quot;Larus&quot;. Recent evidence suggests the South American and African populations may represent two separate cryptic species.

==Description==
The grey-headed gull is slightly larger than the black-headed gull at 42 cm length. The summer adult has a pale grey head, a grey body, slightly darker in tone than in black-headed gull, and red bill and legs. The black tips to the primary wing feathers have conspicuous white &quot;mirrors&quot;. The underwing is dark grey with black wingtips. The grey hood is lost in winter, leaving just two dark smudges around and behind the eye. The eye is dark in immatures, but has a white iris in adults. The sexes are similar. It takes two years to reach maturity; first year birds have a black terminal tail band, and more dark areas in the wings. In flight, the wings are broader than those of black-headed gull. It is a noisy species, especially at colonies. The call is a raucous crow-like &quot;caw, caw&quot;.

It is locally abundant, breeding in large colonies in reedbeds and marshes; it lays two or three eggs in a nest, which can be on the ground or floating. Like most gulls, it is highly gregarious in winter, both when feeding and in evening roosts. Although it is predominantly coastal or estuarine, it is not a pelagic species, and is rarely seen at sea far from land. Flocks numbering hundreds or thousands can form when the feeding conditions are appropriate.

==Taxonomy==
Currently, two subspecies are accepted:

*&quot;C. c. cirrocephalus&quot; – South America
*&quot;C. c. poiocephalus&quot; – Africa

They are scarcely distinguishable, with the South American subspecies slightly larger and paler-backed than the African subspecies, and with a marginally larger white spot (&quot;mirror&quot;) on the two outer primaries. Recent genetic evidence however suggests however that they may represent two separate species, as the African subspecies &quot;C. c. poiocephalus&quot; may be more closely related to the (also African) Hartlaub&#x27;s gull &quot;C. hartlaubii&quot;, than it is to the nominate South American &quot;C. c. cirrocephalus&quot;; if verified, this would require the splitting of the African taxon as a separate species to avoid paraphyly. This has however not yet (as of 2024) been adopted by the IOC World Bird List.

<text>Wassaic station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, located in the town of Amenia, New York. It is the northern terminal of the Harlem Line.

The station is located on New York State Routes 22 and 343 just north of the hamlet of Wassaic.

==History==
The first Wassaic train station was about a half-mile south of its current location and was situated in the actual town section of Wassaic. The station operated by New York and Harlem Railroad, and later New York Central Railroad served the surrounding village area, as well as towns even as far as Connecticut. Following the line&#x27;s construction, a hotel was built in the area, and freight service served three nearby industries that came to the town. In 1968, the railroad merged with longtime rival Pennsylvania Railroad to form Penn Central Railroad, and thus the station and line became property of the newly merged railroad. On March 20, 1972 Penn Central abandoned service north of Dover, and in 1990, rails were removed from Millerton south to milepost 81.33 which became the northernmost point of the freight operation by Penn Central on the Harlem Line.

The physical end of the track is located just north of the current Wassaic yard, at mile post 83.68, there is no track or railroad past that point, but the roadbed, which is still visible, is slowly being reclaimed by nature. The Harlem Valley Rail Trail now operates a paved trail over the existing road bed. Some 45.8 miles (35.9%) of track have been removed in two stages following some bitter court battles.

Before the station reopened on July 9, 2000, Metro-North Railroad rehabilitated the tracks and grade crossings that existed north of Dover Plains and moved the physical location of the Wassaic train station to approximately one half mile north of the old station and constructed a new rail yard facility. The moving of the station to the new location resulted in the re-laying of tracks over the existing rail bed approximately three quarters of a mile where the tracks end.

==Station layout==
The station has one four-car-long high-level side platform to the east of the track. A small storage yard exists to the north of the station platform.

<text>Tenmile River station (formerly State School station) is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, located in Amenia, New York.

The station is located on Sinpatch Road (Dutchess CR 5), next to the crossing of the creek, a short distance east of NY 22/343. Tenmile River is named for the waterway of the same name adjacent to the station as well as north of the grade crossing with Sinpatch Road, and is in nearly the same spot as the State School station (named for a nearby institution for the developmentally disabled, now Taconic Developmental Center) which was closed with Penn Central&#x27;s abandonment of passenger service north of Dover Plains in 1972.

==History==
The station was re-opened with the Wassaic train station on July 9, 2000. Passenger service was initially abandoned north of Dover Plains by Penn Central in 1972, though the line remained in use for freight.

==Station layout==
The station has one two-car-long high-level side platform to the east of the track. Unusually, the MTA has placed identifying signage on concrete pilings opposite the platform to complement the signs on the platform itself.

<doc id="571772" wikidata="Q191952" url="?curid=571772" title="Zero Mostel">
<text>Samuel Joel &quot;Zero&quot; Mostel (February 28, 1915 – September 8, 1977) was an American actor, comedian, and singer. He is best known for his portrayal of comic characters including Tevye on stage in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, Pseudolus on stage and on screen in &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, and Max Bialystock in the original film version of Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Producers&quot; (1967). Mostel was a student of Don Richardson and he used an acting technique based on muscle memory. He was blacklisted during the 1950s; his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee was well publicized. Mostel later starred in the Hollywood Blacklist drama film &quot;The Front&quot; (1976) alongside Woody Allen, for which Mostel was nominated for the British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Mostel was an Obie Award and three-time Tony Award winner. He is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame, inducted posthumously in 1979.

== Early life ==
Mostel was born in Brooklyn, New York to Israel Mostel and Tzina Druchs (also spelled Cina, known as Celia), both Ashkenazi Jewish emigrants from Galicia. 

His father was born in , then in Austria-Hungary, later in Poland, and now in Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. He immigrated to the United States in 1898 with his first wife, Esther Wirklich Mostel, and young daughter, Celia. They would have three more children – Hyman, Sarah (Sadie), and Benjamin – before her death in 1908.

His mother, Tzina, grew up in Vienna, Austria, and immigrated in 1906. Israel had five more children with Tzina: Morris, Milton, Aaron, Samuel (later known as Zero), and William. 

As a child, he earned the nickname &quot;Zero&quot; from his classmates to match his poor grades. He kept the moniker when he went into show business, though his mother hated it.

Initially living in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, the family moved to Moodus, Connecticut, where they bought a farm. The family&#x27;s income in those days came from a winery and a slaughterhouse. The farm failed, and the family moved back to New York, where his father obtained work as a wine chemist. Zero was described by his family as outgoing and lively, and with a developed sense of humor. He showed an intelligence and perception which convinced his father he had the makings of a rabbi, but Zero preferred painting and drawing, a passion he retained for life. 

According to Roger Butterfield, Zero&#x27;s mother sent him to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to copy paintings while dressed in a velvet suit. Zero had a favorite painting, John White Alexander&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, which he copied every day, to the delight of the gallery crowds. One afternoon, while a crowd was watching over his velvet-clad shoulder, he solemnly copied the whole painting upside down, delighting his audience.

In addition to English, Zero Mostel spoke Yiddish, Italian, and German. He attended Public School 188, where he was an A student. He also received professional training as a painter through The Educational Alliance. He completed his high school education at Seward Park High School, where his yearbook noted: &quot;A future Rembrandt... or perhaps a comedian?&quot;. He attended the City College of New York, a public college that allowed many poor students to pursue higher education. He later claimed that he was on the swimming team and the Reserve Officers Training Corps, though the claim is dubious. As only beginner classes were available in art, Mostel took them repeatedly to be able to paint and receive professional feedback. During the time he worked odd jobs. He graduated in 1935 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He then continued studying towards a master&#x27;s degree at New York University before leaving after a year to find work. He then joined the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), which paid him a stipend to teach art.

In 1939, he married Clara Sverd, and the couple moved to an apartment in Brooklyn. The marriage did not last, however, since Clara could not accept the many hours Mostel spent in his studio with his fellow artists, and he did not seem to be able to provide for her at the level to which she had been accustomed. They separated in 1941 and divorced in 1944, Clara only agreeing to the divorce in return for a percentage of Mostel&#x27;s earnings for the rest of his life. The arrangement lasted until the mid-1950s.

== Career ==

=== Early comic routines ===

Part of Mostel&#x27;s duty with the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) was to give gallery talks at New York&#x27;s museums.

In 1941, the Café Society, a downtown Manhattan nightclub, hired Mostel as a professional comedian to play regularly there, where he adopted the stage name Zero.

=== Rise ===
Mostel&#x27;s rise professionally was rapid. In 1942, his salary at the Café Society went up from $40 a week to $450; he appeared on radio shows, opened in two Broadway shows (&quot;Keep Them Laughing&quot;, &quot;Top-Notchers&quot;), played at the Paramount Theatre, appeared in an MGM movie (&quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot;), and booked into &quot;La Martinique&quot; at $4,000 a week. He also made cameo appearances at the Yiddish theatre, which influenced his performance style. In 1943 &quot;Life&quot; magazine described him as &quot;just about the funniest American now living&quot;. In March 1943, Mostel was drafted by the US Army. Although he gave varying accounts of his Army service, records show he was honorably discharged in August 1943 because of an unspecified physical disability. He entertained servicemen giving USO performances until 1945.

Mostel married Kathryn (Kate) Cecilia Harkin, an actress and dancer, on July 2, 1944, after two years of courtship. The pair met at Radio City Music Hall where she was a Rockette. The marriage caused problems in his relationship with his Orthodox Jewish parents: his new wife was not Jewish. His mother never met Kate or her grandsons. The marriage had problems at times, again mostly due to Mostel&#x27;s spending most of his time in his art studio. Their relationship was described by friends of the family as complicated, with many fights but having mutual adoration. The couple stayed together until Mostel&#x27;s death; they had two children, film actor Josh Mostel in 1946 and Tobias in 1948. After Zero&#x27;s discharge from the Army, his career resumed. He appeared in a series of plays, musicals, operas, and movies. In 1946 he even made an attempt at serious operatic acting in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, but received lukewarm reviews. He sang the title role in a short film of Puccini&#x27;s comic opera &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot;. Critics saw him as a versatile performer.

Zero Mostel made notable appearances on New York City television in the late 1940s. He had his own show in 1948 called &quot;Off The Record&quot; on WABD with comedian partner Joey Faye. Simultaneously, Mostel had a live TV show on WPIX, &quot;Channel Zero&quot;. He also appeared in the May 11, 1949 &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; broadcast hosted by Ed Sullivan.

=== Blacklist years and HUAC testimony ===
Mostel had been a leftist since college and his nightclub routine included political jabs at right-wingers. His MGM contract was terminated, and his role in &quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot; was truncated, because studio executives were upset that he participated in protests against another MGM film, &quot;Tennessee Johnson&quot;, which protesters believed had downplayed the racism of former US President Andrew Johnson. According to biographer Arthur Sainer, &quot;MGM blacklisted Zero Mostel way before the days of the blacklist&quot;. During his Army service he was under investigation for alleged Communist Party membership. The Military Intelligence Division of the U.S. War Department said it was &quot;reliably reported&quot; that he was a Communist Party member. The Post Intelligence Officer at the Army&#x27;s Camp Croft, where Mostel served, believed that Mostel was &quot;definitely a Communist.&quot; As a result of that, his application to be an entertainment director with the US Army Special Services unit was denied. Mostel had lobbied hard to transfer to Special Services, at one point traveling to Washington to request a transfer.

It was not until 1950 that Mostel again acted in movies, for a role in the Oscar-winning film &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot;, at the request of its director, Elia Kazan. Kazan describes his attitude and feelings during that period, where
:Each director has a favorite in his cast... my favorite this time was Zero Mostel—but not to bully. I thought him an extraordinary artist and a delightful companion, one of the funniest and most original men I&#x27;d ever met... I constantly sought his company... He was one of the three people whom I rescued from the &quot;industry&#x27;s&quot; blacklist... For a long time, Zero had not been able to get work in films, but I got him in my film.&quot;

Mostel played supporting roles in five movies for Twentieth Century Fox in 1950, all in films released in 1951. Fox then abruptly cancelled his contract. Mostel learned this after he was lent out to Columbia for a film role but not permitted on the set. The studio may have received word that he was about to be named as a Communist in Congressional testimony.

On January 29, 1952, Martin Berkeley identified Mostel to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) as having been a member of the Communist Party. After the testimony he was effectively blacklisted. He was subpoenaed to appear before HUAC on August 14, 1955. Mostel declined to name names and jousted with the members of Congress, invoked the Fifth Amendment, while standing up for his right to the privacy of his personal political beliefs. His testimony won him admiration in the blacklisted community, and in addition to not naming names he also confronted the committee on ideological matters, something that was rarely done. Among other things, he referred to Twentieth Century Fox as &quot;18th Century Fox&quot; (due to its collaboration with the committee), and manipulated the committee members to make them appear foolish. Mostel later commented: &quot;What did they think I was going to do – sell acting secrets to the Russians?&quot;

The admiration he received for his testimony did nothing to take him off the blacklist and the family had to struggle throughout the 1950s with little income. Mostel used this time to work in his studio. Later he said that he cherished those years for the time it had afforded him to do what he loved most. Mostel&#x27;s appearance before the HUAC (as well as others) was incorporated into Eric Bentley&#x27;s 1972 play &quot;Are You Now or Have You Ever Been...?&quot; During this period he also appeared in many regional productions of shows like &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (as Captain Hook) and &quot;Kismet&quot; (as the Wazir), with his name seen prominently in the advertising.

=== &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot; and career revival ===
In 1957, Toby Cole, a New York theatrical agent who strongly opposed the blacklist, contacted Mostel and asked to represent him. Mostel agreed, and the partnership led to the revival of Mostel&#x27;s career and made him a household name. He accepted the role of Leopold Bloom in &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot;, a play based on the novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which he had greatly admired in his youth. It was an Off-Off-Broadway play produced in a small Houston Street theater, but the reviews he received were overwhelmingly favorable. Most notably, &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s Jack Kroll compared him to Laurence Olivier, writing, &quot;Something unbelievable happened. A fat comedian named Zero Mostel gave a performance that was even more astonishing than Olivier&#x27;s&quot;. Mostel received the Obie award for best Off Broadway performance of the 1958–59 season. After the success of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Mostel received many offers to appear in classic roles, especially abroad; he declined the offers because of artistic differences with the directors and the low salaries associated with the roles. By that time the effects of the blacklist were lessening, and in 1959 and 1961 he appeared in two episodes of TV&#x27;s &quot;The Play of the Week&quot;.

=== 1960s and height of career ===

On January 13, 1960, while exiting a taxi on his way back from rehearsals for the play &quot;The Good Soup&quot;, Mostel was hit by a number 18 (now the M86) 86th Street crosstown bus, and his leg was crushed. The doctors wanted to amputate the leg, which would have ended his stage career. Mostel refused, accepting the risk of gangrene, and remained hospitalized for four months. The injury took a huge toll; for the rest of his life, the massively-scarred leg gave him pain and required frequent rests and baths. He sought compensation for the injury by retaining the famous Harry Lipsig (the 5&#x27;3&quot; self-described &quot;King of Torts&quot;) as his attorney. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum. From this time forward, whenever he attended the Metropolitan Opera, Mostel carried a cane to go along with the cape that he also favored.

Later in the year Mostel took on the role of Estragon in a TV adaptation of &quot;Waiting for Godot.&quot; In 1961, he played Jean in &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; to very favorable reviews. &quot;The New Republic&#x27;s&quot; Robert Brustein said that he had &quot;a great dancer&#x27;s control of movement, a great actor&#x27;s control of voice, a great mime&#x27;s control of facial expressions.&quot; His transition onstage from man to rhinoceros became a thing of legend; he won his first Tony Award for Best Actor, even though he was not in the lead role. In 1962 Mostel began work on the role of Pseudolus in the Broadway musical &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,&quot; which was to be one of his best-remembered roles. The role of Pseudolus was originally offered to Phil Silvers, who declined it, saying he did not want to do this &quot;old shtick&quot;. Mostel did not originally want to do the role either, which he thought below his capabilities, but was convinced by his wife and agent. The reviews were excellent, and, after a few slow weeks after which the play was partially rewritten with a new opening song, &quot;Comedy Tonight&quot;, which became the play&#x27;s most popular piece, the show became a great commercial success, running 964 performances and conferring star status on Mostel (he also won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for this role). A film version was produced in 1966, also starring Mostel – and Silvers.

On September 22, 1964, Mostel opened as Tevye in the original Broadway production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof.&quot; Because of Mostel&#x27;s respect for the works of Sholem Aleichem he insisted that more of the author&#x27;s mood and style be incorporated into the musical, and he made major contributions to its shape. He also created the cantorial sounds made famous in the song &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;Zero Mostel&#x27;s Tevye is so penetrating and heartwarming that you all but forget that it is a performance.&quot; In later years, the actors who followed Mostel in the role of Tevye invariably followed his staging. The show received rave reviews and was a great commercial success, running 3,242 performances, a record at the time. Mostel received a Tony Award for it and was invited to a reception in the White House, officially ending his status as a political pariah.

Mostel in 1967 appeared as Potemkin in &quot;Great Catherine&quot;. He was due to co-star with Julie Newmar in &quot;Monsieur Lecoq&quot; filmed in France and the U.K., but the film was never completed. In the same year he took the role of Max Bialystock in &quot;The Producers.&quot; Mostel refused to accept the role of Max at first, but director Mel Brooks persuaded him to show the script to his wife, who then talked Mostel into doing it. His performance originally received mixed reviews, and the film overall was not a great success at the time of its release. The comedy, however, has since achieved classic status in the decades after its premiere. Reflecting on that rising popularity, Roger Ebert, longtime critic for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, wrote in 2000, &quot;This is one of the funniest movies ever made&quot;, adding that Mostel&#x27;s performance &quot;is a masterpiece of low comedy.&quot;

He lived in a large rented apartment in The Belnord on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and built a summer house on Monhegan Island in Maine.

== Last years ==

In his last decade, Mostel&#x27;s star dimmed as he appeared in movies that were received with indifference by both critics and the general audience. These titles include &quot;The Great Bank Robbery&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Scoundrel&quot;. In the 1970s, he often played supporting rather than lead roles.

His more notable films in these years include the movie version of &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; (appearing with his &quot;Producers&quot; costar Gene Wilder), &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; and &quot;The Front&quot; (where he played Hecky Brown, a blacklisted performer whose story bears a similarity to Mostel&#x27;s own, and for which he was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor). Screenwriter Walter Bernstein loosely based the character of Hecky Brown on television actor Philip Loeb, who was a friend of Mostel. On Broadway, he starred in revivals of &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot; (receiving a Tony nomination for Best Actor) and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. He also made memorable appearances in children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;The Electric Company&quot; (for which he performed the Spellbinder in the Letterman cartoons), and gave voice to the boisterous seagull Kehaar in the animated film &quot;Watership Down&quot;. He also appeared as a guest star during Season 2 of &quot;&quot;The Muppet Show&quot;&quot;, taped during mid-1977 and broadcast after his death.

=== Death ===
In the last four months of his life, Mostel took on a nutritionally unsound diet (later described by his friends as a starvation diet) that reduced his weight from to . During rehearsals for Arnold Wesker&#x27;s new play &quot;The Merchant&quot; (in which Mostel played a reimagined version of Shakespeare&#x27;s Shylock) in Philadelphia, he collapsed in his dressing room and was taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. He was diagnosed with a respiratory disorder; it was believed he was in no danger and would be released soon. However, on September 8, 1977, Mostel complained of dizziness and lost consciousness. The attending physicians were unable to revive him, and he was pronounced dead that evening. It is believed that he suffered an aortic aneurysm. Wesker wrote a book chronicling the out-of-town tribulations that beset the play and culminated in Zero&#x27;s death called &quot;The Birth of Shylock and the Death of Zero Mostel&quot;.

In accordance with his final requests, his family did not stage any funeral or other memorial service. Mostel was cremated following his death; the location of his ashes is not publicly known.

== Professional relationships ==
Mostel often collided with directors and other performers in the course of his professional career. He was described as irreverent, believing himself to be a comic genius (many critics agreed with him) and showed little patience for incompetence. He often improvised, which was received well by audiences but which often left other performers (who were not prepared for his ad-libbed lines) confused and speechless during live performances. He often dominated the stage whether or not his role called for it. Norman Jewison stated this as a reason for preferring Chaim Topol for the role of Tevye in the movie version of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. Mostel took exception to these criticisms:

Other producers, such as Jerome Robbins and Hal Prince, preferred to hire Mostel on short contracts, knowing that he would become less faithful to the script as time went on. His exuberant personality, though largely responsible for his success, had also intimidated others in his profession and prevented him from receiving some important roles. In his autobiography &quot;Kiss Me Like a Stranger&quot;, actor Gene Wilder describes being initially terrified of Mostel. However, just after being introduced, Mostel got up, walked over to Wilder, hugged him, and planted a big kiss on his lips. Wilder claims to be grateful to Mostel for teaching him such a valuable lesson, and for picking Wilder up every day so that they could ride to work together. He also tells the story of a dinner celebrating the release of &quot;The Producers&quot;. Mostel switched Wilder&#x27;s place card with Dick Shawn&#x27;s, allowing Wilder to sit at the main table. Mostel and Wilder later worked together in &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; and the Letterman cartoons for the children&#x27;s show &quot;The Electric Company&quot;. The two remained close friends until Mostel&#x27;s death.

Mostel was the subject of the 2006 retrospective play &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, written and performed by actor/playwright Jim Brochu. The play recounts events from Mostel&#x27;s life and career, including his HUAC testimony, his professional relationships, and his theatrical work.

<text>Dover Plains station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, located in Dover, New York.

==History==
Rail service in Dover Plains can be traced as far back as December 31, 1848 with the establishment of the New York and Harlem Railroad, which became part of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1864 and eventually taken over by the New York Central Railroad (NYC).

Besides passenger service, freight service also originated and stopped at this location, in both directions north and south. It even contained a nearby railroad hotel. Under the New York Central, for the first five decades of the 20th century the station hosted through trains such as the &quot;Berkshire Hills Express&quot; to North Adams, Massachusetts via other towns in the Berkshires section of Massachusetts.

As with most of the Harlem Line, the merger of New York Central with Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 transformed the station into a Penn Central Railroad station. Penn Central&#x27;s continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and abandon service north of Dover Plains, thus transforming it into a terminal station in 1972. Freight service north of Dover Plains was abandoned by Conrail on March 27, 1980. The ticket office was closed in September 1981. The line itself became part of Metro-North in 1983. The 1860-built NYC station house contained a bagel restaurant, until it was closed in the 2010s, and left vacant, and the former freight house also still exists. Dover Plains was a terminal station until 2000 when Metro-North expanded the line back to Wassaic.

==Station layout==
The station has one four-car-long high-level side platform to the west of the track.

<doc id="571780" wikidata="Q5725440" url="?curid=571780" title="Henry Marc Brunel">
<text>Henry Marc Brunel (27 June 1842 – 7 October 1903) was an English civil engineer and the son of engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel and grandson of civil engineer Marc Isambard Brunel best known for his design work on Tower Bridge built in partnership with Sir John Wolfe Barry.

== Early life and education ==
Henry Marc Brunel, known as Henry, was born in Westminster, London, on 27 June 1842, the second son of the celebrated engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Elizabeth Mary Horsley. 

After being educated at Harrow School, Brunel decided to follow in his father and grandfather&#x27;s footsteps by becoming a civil engineer and attended King&#x27;s College London from 1859, the year of his father&#x27;s death, until 1861. He then gained experience in civil engineering initially being apprenticed for three years to Sir William Armstrong from 1861. 

== Career ==
In 1863 Brunel joined Sir John Hawkshaw initially as his pupil then becoming his assistant until 1870. While in this role he assisted on the construction of Penarth Dock, Cardiff (where he gained his first experience as resident engineer), Albert Dock, Hull, and in an assessment of the Caledonian Railway. 

He helped take down his father&#x27;s Hungerford Bridge with Sir John Hawkshaw, the chains being now at Clifton Suspension Bridge. He also conducted initial surveys for a Channel Tunnel, a project in which Hawkshaw was particularly interested. 

Brunel is noted for a partnership from 1878 with Sir John Wolfe Barry, with whom he designed the Blackfriars Railway Bridge and (after Sir Horace Jones died) Tower Bridge over the River Thames in central London. The profit share in the partnership demonstrated Barry&#x27;s leadership of the new firm with Brunel being limited to 10% of the partnership&#x27;s net profit up to a gross income of £4,500 per annum.

It is for his role on Tower Bridge for which Brunel is best known. His first involvement dated back to 1878 when he prepared a case against Bazalgette&#x27;s proposal for a low bridge for the Parliamentary Committee. After the death of Horace Jones, and the appointment of Barry to be in charge, Brunel was tasked with the detailed design of the bridge and then supervised the construction being led by Edward Cruttwell, the resident engineer. 

Barry and Brunel&#x27;s other works included the docks at Barry in south Wales and the Creagan Bridge, a railway bridge over the narrows of Loch Creran in Scotland (jointly credited to Wolfe Barry, Brunel and Edward Cruttwell). Sir Alexander Gibb was a pupil of Brunel and Wolfe Barry in 1895.

He also designed the SS &quot;Chauncy Maples&quot;, which was built in Glasgow in 1899 and transported overland to Lake Nyasa in Africa, where it served for more than one hundred years as a mission and hospital clinic.
== Institutions ==
Brunel was elected a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 6 March 1877, and was a Member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and Institution of Naval Architects.

== Personal life ==
Brunel developed an interest in acting as a hobby, becoming a member of the Scientific and Amateur Dramatic Societies, and also contributed to his brother&#x27;s biography of their father whose reputation he protected and promoted, working with his brother Isambard.

In Autumn 1901 Brunel suffered a stroke, and he died at his home 21 Abingdon, Westminster on 7 October 1903. He is buried with his father, grandfather, and other family members at Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

Brunel neither married nor had children and was the last of the Brunel engineering dynasty.

<text>Moon Palace is a novel written by Paul Auster that was first published in 1989.

The novel is set in Manhattan and the U.S. Southwest, and centers on the life of the narrator Marco Stanley Fogg and the two previous generations of his family.

== Plot summary==

Marco Fogg is an orphan and his Uncle Victor his only caretaker. Fogg starts college, and nine months later moves from the dormitory into his own apartment, furnished with 1492 books given to him by Uncle Victor. Uncle Victor dies before Fogg finishes college and leaves him without friends and family. Marco inherits some money which he uses to pay for Uncle Victor&#x27;s funeral. He becomes an introvert, spends his time reading, and thinks, &quot;Why should I get a job? I have enough to do living through the days.&quot; After selling the books one by one in order to survive Fogg loses his apartment and seeks shelter in Central Park. He meets Kitty Wu and begins a romance with her after he has been rescued from Central Park by his friend Zimmer and Kitty Wu. Eventually he finds a job caring for an elderly man named Thomas Effing.

Fogg learns about the complicated history of his parents, and Effing’s previous identity as the painter Julian Barber. During this time Effing becomes a father figure to Fogg. When Effing dies, leaving money to Fogg, Marco and Kitty Wu set up a house together in Chinatown. After an abortion Fogg breaks up with Kitty Wu and travels across the U.S. to search for himself. He begins his journey with his father Solomon Barber, who dies shortly after an accident at Westlawn Cemetery, where Fogg&#x27;s mother is buried. Marco continues his journey alone, which ends on a lonely California beach: &quot;This is where I start, ... this is where my life begins.&quot;

===From Uncle Victor to Columbia University===

Marco Stanley Fogg, aka M.S., is the son of Emily Fogg. He does not know his father. His mother dies because of a car accident when he is eleven years old. He moves to his Uncle Victor, who raises him until Marco goes to a boarding school in Chicago. When he reaches college age, he goes to Columbia University in New York City. After spending his freshman year in a college dormitory, he rents an apartment in New York.

Uncle Victor dies, which makes Marco lose track. After paying the funeral costs, Marco realizes that very little of the money that Uncle Victor gave him is left. He decides to let himself decay, to get out of touch with the world. He makes no effort to earn money. His electricity is cut off, he loses weight; finally he is told that he must leave his apartment. The day before he is thrown out, Marco decides to ask Zimmer, an old college friend with whom he has lost contact, for help. Zimmer has moved to another apartment, so when Marco arrives at Zimmer&#x27;s old apartment, he is invited by some strangers to join their breakfast. At that breakfast he meets Kitty Wu for the first time. She seems to fall in love with him. The next day, Marco has to leave his flat, and finds himself on the streets of Manhattan.

===Central Park===

Central Park becomes Marco&#x27;s new home. Here he seeks shelter from the pressure of the Manhattan streets. He finds food in the garbage cans. Marco even manages to stay in touch with what is going on in the world by reading newspapers left by visitors. Although life in Central Park is not very comfortable, he feels at ease because he&#x27;s enjoying his solitude and he restores the balance between his inner and outer self. This part devoted to Central Park may be considered an echo to the main themes of Transcendentalism and the works of Thoreau and Whitman.

At first, the weather is very good, so where to stay is not a big problem. But after a few weeks the weather changes. In a strong rain shower, Marco becomes ill and retires to a cave in Central Park. After some days of delirium, he crawls out of the cave and has wild hallucinations while lying outside. There, he is finally found by Zimmer and Kitty Wu, who have been looking for him for the whole time. Due to the fever he mistakes Kitty for a Native American and calls her Pocahontas.

===At Zimmer&#x27;s===

Zimmer (the German word for room) is a good friend, hosts Marco in his apartment, bears all his expenses, and helps him to recover. But when Marco has to go for his army physical, he is still rated unfit because of his poor physiological and mental state. Marco feels very bad about living at Zimmer&#x27;s expense, so he finally persuades Zimmer to let him do a French translation for him to earn some money. Then he meets Kitty again, and decides to leave Zimmer. They lose touch, and when, after thirteen years, they happen to run into each other in a busy street, Marco learns that Zimmer has married and become a typical middle-class citizen.

===At Effing&#x27;s===

After he has finished his work on the translation, Marco searches for another job offer. He finds a job at Effing&#x27;s, where he is hired for reading books to Effing and driving the old, blind and disabled man through the city of New York in his wheelchair. Effing is a strange man who tries to teach Marco in his own way, to &quot;take nothing for granted&quot;. Marco has to describe to Effing all the things he can see while driving the old man around. This way, Marco learns to look at the things around him very precisely. Later, Effing tells Marco to do the main work he was hired for: write his obituary. Effing tells him the main facts of his life as the famous painter Julian Barber and his conversion to Thomas Effing. He went to Utah with Byrne, a topographer, and Scoresby, a guide, to paint the vast country. Byrne fell from a high place and the guide fled, leaving Barber alone in the middle of the desert. Barber finds a cave where a hermit used to live and begins to live there. He kills the Gresham brothers, three bandits, and takes the money to San Francisco, where he officially takes the name &quot;Thomas Effing&quot;. He becomes rich, but one day someone tells him he&#x27;s very similar to Julian Barber, a famous painter who disappeared. He sinks in depression and fear, and begins frequenting China Town and using drugs. But one day someone attacks him, so he rushes away and hits a street lamp, becoming paraplegic. He stops having such an unhealthy life, and decides to go to France. He comes back to the US in 1939 fleeing from the Nazis.

===Solomon Barber===
Solomon Barber is Marco&#x27;s father and Effing&#x27;s son. He is extremely fat (which contrasts to Marco&#x27;s period of starvation) and did not know his father nor that he has a son. He inherits most of the fortune of Effing. He meets Marco after the death of Effing to learn about his father and finds a son. Marco, in the family cyclic pattern, does not know that Barber is his father. Barber had a relationship with one of his students, Emily, and never knew she was pregnant. Marco learns the truth when he sees Barber crying in front of Emily&#x27;s grave.

==Characters==

===Marco Stanley Fogg / M.S.===

The name:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Marco&quot; refers to Marco Polo, the western explorer who reached China (Later M.S. &quot;discovers&quot; Kitty Wu and Uncle Victor gives him 1492 books, like the year of the discovery of &quot;The New World&quot; by Columbus).

&quot;Stanley&quot; refers to the reporter Henry Morton Stanley, who found Dr. David Livingstone in the heart of darkest Africa. This could be related to the fact that he finds or discovers his father and grandfather.

&quot;Fogg&quot; originally comes from Fogelmann (probably, deriving from German &quot;&quot;Vogel&quot; - &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;Mann&quot; - &quot;man&quot;&quot;), which was changed to Fog by the immigration department. The second &quot;g&quot; was added later. Marco says about his last name: &quot;A bird flying through the fog, a giant bird flying across the ocean, not stopping until it reached America&quot; (this resembles the American Dream).

&quot;Fogg&quot; refers to Phileas Fogg, the protagonist in the novel of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; is also referred to in the book as Marco happens to see the 1956 movie adaption twice.

&quot;M.S.&quot; Uncle Victor tells Marco &quot;M.S.&quot; stands for manuscript, a book that is not yet finished (everybody is writing his own life, his own story). &quot;MS&quot; also refers to a disease: the multiple sclerosis. Marco quite appreciates this strangeness in his name.

===Uncle Victor===

Uncle Victor - the brother of Marco&#x27;s mother - is a &quot;spindly, beak-nosed bachelor&quot; of forty-three who earns his living as a clarinetist. Although he lacks ambition, Uncle Victor must have been a good musician because for some time he is a member of the famous Cleveland Orchestra. Like all Foggs, he is characterized by a certain aimlessness in life. He does not settle down, but is constantly on the move. Because of a thoughtless joke, he has to leave the renowned Cleveland Orchestra. Then he plays in smaller combos: the Moonlight Moods and later the Moon Men. In order to earn a sufficient living, he also gives clarinet lessons to beginners. His last job is selling encyclopedias.

Uncle Victor is given to dreams, his mind restlessly shifting from one thing to another. He is interested in baseball and in all kinds of sport. His rich imagination and creativity allow him to invent playful activities for his nephew Marco. Uncle Victor carries out his guardianship for Marco in a responsible way, but he does not exercise adult authority over Marco. He forms a relationship based on sympathy, love and friendship. Marco loves his uncle&#x27;s easy-going lifestyle, his humor and his generosity. Uncle Victor is also quite open-minded, likes movies and is fairly well-read, with 1492 books - a number obviously meant to remind us of the year when Columbus discovered America.

===Thomas Effing / Julian Barber===

Thomas Effing, father of Solomon and grandfather of Marco, was born as Julian Barber. He was a famous painter who lived in a house on a cliff. He was married to Elizabeth Wheeler, a young woman who, after the marriage, was a repeat victim of marital rape. Julian Barber eventually wanted to travel to the West and as his wife got scared he would not come back, she spent one night with him. He undertook the expedition anyway and lived as a hermit in the desert for a little bit over a year. Since he never returned home to his pregnant wife, everybody thought that he was dead. He decided to be &#x27;dead&#x27; and changed his name to Thomas Effing.

The first name Thomas was chosen by Julian Barber because he admired the painter Thomas Moran. The surname Effing echoes the inappropriate word f-ing (*fucking*). He adopted it to indicate that his whole life was &quot;fucked up&quot;.

He started a new life as Thomas, and was then attacked which resulted in an accident that caused him to become paralyzed. He travels to Paris, where he stays until the beginning of the Second World War. Next he moves into a big New York apartment with his housemaid &#x27;Mrs Hume&#x27; and his assistant Pavel Shum, a Russian student he met in Paris. Effing later learns that he has a son, an obese history professor, but never contacts him. After Pavel died in a car accident Effing employs Marco, his grandson, as his new assistant. Marco must read all kinds of books to him, describe the Manhattan scenery to the blind man while he takes him for walks in his wheelchair, and eventually has to write Effing&#x27;s obituary.

===Kitty Wu===
Kitty is a girl with Chinese roots who falls in love with Marco and helps in searching for him during his Central Park period. This scene is a reference to the novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, where the hero, Phileas Fogg, rescues an Indian woman from death; it can also be considered a reference to Pocahontas.

Like Marco she is an orphan as her parents had died when she was a child.
After Effing&#x27;s death they move together, having a passionate relationship.
But Marco leaves Kitty when she decides to have an abortion, and does not contact her until his father dies. But Kitty refuses to live with him again.

==Symbols and motifs==

===The quest for identities===
Both Marco and Solomon are raised without having a father. This has a major impact on them:

* Marco completely loses orientation when Uncle Victor dies. He is devastated about not knowing his father. Throughout the novel, Marco tries to find his roots. Shortly after finding his father, he loses him again.
* Solomon writes a book that deals with the topic of a fatherless life at the age of seventeen, showing his own internal quest for identity. He does this by spending his nights composing it.
* Marco says that his uncle Victor &quot;loved to concoct elaborate, nonsensical theories about things,&quot; related to his name. (Auster 6). Marco says that according to Victor, &quot;Marco naturally enough was for Marco Polo, the first European to visit China.&quot; (Auster 7). Victor&#x27;s relationship with Kitty Wu is symbolic of Marco finally making it to China. This is due to Kitty Wu having come from Chinese descent. 

=== The moon ===

In this interview, published in &quot;The Red Notebook&quot;, Paul Auster looks at the meanings of the moon in Moon Palace:

A more prosaic explanation of the title is that the Moon Palace was a Chinese restaurant (now defunct) in the Morningside Heights neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which was a popular student hangout when Auster was studying at Columbia University.

== Similarities to author&#x27;s life ==
Some aspects of the main character&#x27;s life in &quot;Moon Palace&quot; mirror the life of the author. He was a descendant of an Austrian Jewish family, born on the Third of February 1947 in Newark, New Jersey, which is about 15 miles west of New York City. He also attended high school there. In his childhood, Auster&#x27;s father Samuel Auster was often absent. Samuel Auster was a businessman who left the house in the morning before his son was awake and returned home when he was already in bed. Auster always searched for someone to replace his father. Unlike his father, his mother gave Auster very much attention. In fact this may also put a different light on the title, as the moon is symbolic of the female or the mother.

*Paul Auster and Marco Fogg were both born in 1947.
*Marco&#x27;s, Solomon&#x27;s and Paul&#x27;s father were all absent during their sons&#x27; childhoods.
*When Paul&#x27;s uncle travelled to Europe he stored several boxes of books at the Austers&#x27; home. Paul Auster read one book after the other. The same goes for Marco, who read his Uncle Victor&#x27;s books.
*They both studied at Columbia University, New York.
*Both of them were involved in the student demonstrations at Columbia University.
*Both Paul and Marco lost a lot of weight after running out of money.
*Effing and Paul went to France (Paris).
*Like Effing finds twenty thousand dollars in the saddlebag of the three gangsters he killed, Paul&#x27;s son has stolen three thousand dollars out of the bag of a dead guy.

== Adaptations ==

In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;Moon Palace&quot;, narrated by Joe Barrett, as part of its &quot;Modern Vanguard&quot; line of audiobooks.

<text>Harlem Valley–Wingdale station (formerly State Hospital station) on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, located in the Wingdale section of Dover, New York. It is adjacent to the site of the former Harlem Valley State Hospital.

==History==

The station was formerly known as &quot;State Hospital&quot; and was a flag stop between the 1930s and 1960s. It was built to serve the Harlem Valley State Hospital, and was expanded from a simple wooden platform to a shelter with a wood-burning stove. The Wingdale station (originally known as &quot;Wing&#x27;s station,&quot; then &quot;South Dover station&quot;) was approximately one half mile north in the hamlet on Dutchess CR 21 (Pleasant Ridge Road) and opened on December 31, 1848. It was located near such hotels as the 1806-built Jackson Wing Inn, and the 1858-built Duell Hotel, the latter of which still stands today. In the post-World War II era, the station was reduced from a station house, to a shelter along the platform.

As with most of the Harlem Line, the merger of New York Central with Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 transformed the two stations into Penn Central Railroad stations. Penn Central&#x27;s continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and abandon service north of Dover Plains. Penn Central continued to provide coal service to the hospital until it was taken over by Conrail, which continued coal service well into the 1990s. The stations were consolidated in 1977 with the State Hospital station being renamed Harlem Valley-Wingdale and the Wingdale stop being discontinued, thus transforming the station into the penultimate station on the Harlem Line, until Metro-North acquired the line in 1983, and re-extended it to Wassaic in 2000.

==Station layout==
The station has one four-car-long high-level side platform to the east of the track. It originally contained two tracks with a separate spur leading to the coal-fueled power plant for the hospital.

<doc id="571791" wikidata="Q795533" url="?curid=571791" title="BBC Asian Network">
<text>BBC Asian Network is a radio station owned and operated by the BBC. The station&#x27;s target audience is people &quot;with an interest in British Asian lifestyles&quot;, especially those between the ages of 18 and 34. The station has production centres at Broadcasting House in London and The Mailbox in Birmingham.

The station broadcasts mainly in English, but has retained Sunday evening shows in South Asian languages.

Despite the name, BBC Asian Network covers only the Indian subcontinent, with the rest of the continent – such as Japan and China – not covered by the station.

The station&#x27;s output consists largely of music and talk programmes. On Fridays at 4:00 pm, the station broadcasts &quot;The Official Asian Music Chart&quot;, compiled by the Official Charts Company and based on sales and streams across a seven-day period.

According to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 542,000 with a listening share of 0.2% as of March 2024.

==History==

===Origins as a regional programme / station===
By 1949, the BBC had introduced their first weekly Bengali language programme, &quot;Anjuman&quot;, through the efforts of Nazir Ahmed and Nurul Momen. Momen also conducted a children&#x27;s programme titled &quot;Kakoli&quot;. The BBC was later joined by more Bengalis such as Fateh Lohani and Fazle Lohani. BBC television had also broadcast an Asian news programme, &quot;Nai Zindagi Naya Jeevan&quot;, since 1968 from its studios in Birmingham; this series followed a traditional news and current affairs format.

In 1976, BBC Radio Leicester, responding to the growth of the size of the South Asian population and rising racial tension in Leicester, introduced a daily community show called &quot;Six Fifteen&quot;, aimed primarily at that community in the city. By 1977, CRE research showed that the programme regularly reached 67% of the South Asian community in Leicester. BBC Radio Leicester dominated the provision of Asian programming on BBC local radio and by 1990 was producing one third of the output. In 1989, BBC WM, the BBC radio station for the Midlands, followed Radio Leicester&#x27;s lead and introduced a similar daily show as part of a new Midlands Asian Network.

On 30 October 1989, The Asian Network was launched on the medium wave transmitters of BBC WM and BBC Radio Leicester, with a combined output of 57 hours per week. This was extended to 86 hours a week in 1995 and on 4 November 1996 the station became a full-time service, on air for eighteen hours a day in Leicester and Birmingham, and was relaunched as the BBC Asian Network with programming also broadcast on the MW transmitters of stations with large Asian communities (with the exception of BBC GLR which was an FM-only station).

===Station goes national===
In November 1999, as part of the addition of a suite of BBC and commercial radio services to the Sky Digital satellite television platform, BBC Asian Network was made available to Sky viewers alongside BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC World Service, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Ulster.

On Monday 28 October 2002, it was relaunched for the DAB Digital Radio system, now broadcasting nationwide.

In January 2006, the BBC announced that they were investing an extra £1m in the BBC Asian Network, and increasing the number of full-time staff by 30% in a bid to make British South Asian interests &quot;a mainstream part of the corporation&#x27;s output&quot;.

===2006 branding and schedule changes===
In April 2006, the first wave of schedule changes were introduced with further changes coming into effect on 14 May and 21 May, with weekend changes occurring from 17 June. In August 2007, the Asian Network received a new logo as part of a general re-brand of all national BBC stations. In 2009, this was rebranded again to add prominence to the Asian aspect of the logo.

===Drama output until 2010===
One of the most significant programmes in the Asian Network line-up was an ongoing Asian soap opera &quot;Silver Street&quot;, which was first broadcast in 2004. Storylines focused on the lives of a British South Asian community in an unnamed English town, with themes that generally related to issues that affect the daily lives of British South Asians and their neighbours.

Following the reduction of episode lengths to five minutes per day and continued falling listenership, on 16 November 2009 the BBC announced they would be cancelling &quot;Silver Street&quot;. The last episode was broadcast in March 2010. The cancellation grew out of many criticisms of the Asian Network in the BBC Trust&#x27;s Annual Report.

&quot;Silver Street&quot; was replaced by monthly half-hour dramas and in August 2010, BBC Asian Network announced it would be launching a new drama season from 1 September 2010.

===2020s===
In March 2022, &quot;BBC Introducing on Asian Network&quot; with Jasmine Takhar was nominated for Best Radio Show at the Music Week Awards. It was the first Asian Network show with a Music Week Award nomination since the awards were launched. The show would be nominated again in 2023. The show also celebrated International Women’s Day broadcasting from Maida Vale Studios.

In February 2023, the network launched their first tour with Nikita Kanda&#x27;s breakfast show visiting Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow.

BBC Asian Network were part of the BBC Introducing Showcase at the Great Escape Festival on Friday 12 May at the Paganini Ballroom in Brighton.

Breakfast show host Nikita Kanda took part in 21st series of Strictly Come Dancing where she was the second person voted out of the show.

==Threat of closure and controversies==

===Threat of closure===
On 26 February 2010 &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Mark Thompson, Director General of the BBC, proposed closing the station in a bid to scale back BBC operations and allow commercial rivals more room. The proposal of closure – along with BBC Radio 6 Music – was later confirmed on 2 March.

Listeners writing on the official Asian Network message boards advocated keeping their station at the expense of 6 Music, and letter was written to the BBC Trust and had been signed by people, with the actual number of signatories was artificially boosted with some signing their name more than once (as both a single name and as part of different collectives). The BBC Trust rejected plans to close 6 Music and later in 2011 rejected plans to close the Asian Network in favour of reducing its budget by 50%.

=== Sliding audiences and increasing costs ===
In July 2009 it was revealed that the Asian Network had lost over 20% of its listeners in a single year and, per listener, was the most costly and expensive BBC radio station to operate.

In 2011, the BBC ruled there would be a 46% reduction in the Asian Network&#x27;s budget and a declared target of 600,000 listeners a week; with actual audience numbers only peaking at 507,000. In 2012, audience numbers fell even further; peaking at only 453,000. Even with the budget reductions, in 2013 the Asian Network had the largest budget of the BBC&#x27;s digital-only radio stations at £13m; despite having the lowest audience figures by far.

RAJAR&#x27;s figures in 2014 showed that the Asian Network had at last briefly met the target set four years earlier, finally peaking at 619,000 listeners in Q4. However, the Asian Network was noted as being the BBC&#x27;s only station – across both television and radio – whose Appreciation Index measurably fell in 2014.

By May 2015, the Asian Network had once again lost a substantial number of listeners, with the RAJAR reporting a peak of just 562,000 listeners – a loss of 57,000 from the previous quarter.

In 2016–17, the Asian Network had the second highest cost-per-user of all the BBC&#x27;s radio stations, at 3.4p per hour, the second highest budget of the BBC&#x27;s digital-only radio stations at £7.5m and by far the lowest audience figures of all the BBC&#x27;s stations.

In 2017/18, it was noted the station not only remained as having the highest cost-per-user of all the BBC radio output, but whose costs also increased – rising from 3.4p per hour the previous year to 3.7p per hour. The audience Appreciation Index figure did not increase, remaining at 80.3; and the average length of time spent on the channel dramatically fell from 06:11 to 05:19 – the biggest fall of all of the BBC&#x27;s radio stations.

In 2018/19, the Asian Network&#x27;s annual budget increased from £7m to £8m, but the station continued to perform poorly: population reach was down again to 1.1%, time spent on the channel per week fell again to 5:12 and an increase in cost per user per hour (up to 5p).

The station&#x27;s poor performance continued into 2019/20, where it was noted time spent on the channel fell dramatically again by 20% to just 4:07, while the cost per use per hour had increased up to 6p, remaining the BBC&#x27;s most expensive-per-listener station. Peak audience figures plunged down to 519,000 listeners, losing 13.8%.

In 2021/22, the stations audience reach fell to just 1% – the station continues to have by far the lowest audience figures and highest cost-per-user figures of all the BBC&#x27;s stations.

In 2022/23, Asian Network&#x27;s audience reach remained at just 1%.

===Rotherham sex abuse scandal controversy===
In 2018, the station&#x27;s Head of News Arif Ansari was charged under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 after a reporter was thought to have named a victim of the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal during a live news bulletin. In January 2019, he was cleared when a judge ruled that Ansari was not at fault and had been incorrectly told the name of the victim was a pseudonym. He was the first BBC editor to be tried under the legislation.

<text>Appalachian Trail station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, serving campers and hikers destined for the Appalachian Trail, in Pawling, New York. It is the only rail station directly located on the Appalachian Trail. Trains stop on weekends and holidays only.

==Description and history==

The station was built in three months by Metro-North Railroad in 1990 for the cost of $10,000. The station opened on April 1, 1990. Its creation was the suggestion of George Zoebelein, who was an avid hiker and a veteran of the NY/NJ Trail Conference as well as both the NY/NJ Appalachian Trail Conferences, and also served as a member of the Metro-North Railroad Commuter Council (MNRCC) of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee (PCAC) to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. It is one of three limited service stops operated by Metro-North primarily for hikers, the other two being and on the Hudson Line.

The trail itself crosses the track just south of the station. In the northbound direction, it leads immediately to a small grassy parking area along Route 22 with space for a few cars, then follows the highway to paved turnouts with more space a few hundred feet north along either side of the highway, just north of where it leaves the road and starts climbing toward Hammersly Ridge and the Pawling Nature Preserve. South of the station the trail crosses a swampy area via a wooden, wheelchair accessible walkway which leads to a bridge and then climbs a smaller ridge.

==Station layout==
The station has a low-level wooden side platform to the east of the track, long enough for one door of one car to receive and discharge passengers. The platform has no shelter, but has a bulletin board for posting the current train schedule, as well as information for hikers.

<doc id="571802" wikidata="Q1933094" url="?curid=571802" title="Ruyton-XI-Towns">
<text>Ruyton-XI-Towns ( &quot;ry-tən eleven towns&quot;), formally Ruyton of the Eleven Towns or simply Ruyton, is a village and civil parish next to the River Perry in Shropshire, England. It had a population of 1,379 at the 2011 Census.

The preparatory school Packwood Haugh is north of the village. Footpaths south of the village lead to the sandstone promontory known as The Cliffe. It is still an area of common land, which is the northern section of the Nesscliffe Hill Country Park.

==Toponym==
Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Ruitone&quot;, the village acquired its unusual compound name in the twelfth century when a castle was built, and it became the major manor of eleven local townships. The Roman numeral for eleven, whose earliest occurrence is stated to be 1379, is included in its name. Some of the eleven ancient townships, mostly situated to the north and west of Ruyton, still survive as hamlets today; although some, like Coton, are just a collection of farm buildings. The eleven were Ruyton, Coton, Shotatton, Shelvock, Eardiston and Wykey, which remain in the parish; and Felton, Haughton, Rednal, Sutton and Tedsmore, now in the parish of West Felton.

==History==
Lying in the Welsh Marches, Ruyton Castle was rebuilt by 1313 but was destroyed again by Owain Glyndŵr during his rising against England beginning in 1400. Its ruins stand in the parish churchyard.

In 1308, an attempt was made to refound the town as &quot;New Ruyton&quot;, when it was awarded a charter that briefly gave it the same powers as the County of Bristol. However, as raiding continued, the new town declined and lost most of its rights, its borough status (with that of Clun) being formally abolished in 1886.

The oldest parts of the parish church date from between 1120 and 1148.

==Notable residents==
*Corbet Kynaston, Jacobite Tory politician, died at Shelvock, one of his manors, in 1740. 
*John Robert Kenyon, lawyer and Vinerian Professor of English Law at Oxford University, was born in 1807 and died in 1880 at Pradoe in the parish.
*Arthur Conan Doyle, while a medical student, worked as an unpaid assistant in the village for a Dr Eliot for four months in 1878, living at &quot;Cliffe House&quot;. He later recalled Ruyton in his &quot;Memories and Recollections&quot; (1923) as &quot;not big enough to make one town, far less eleven&quot;. 
*Frederic Richardson Murray, later Archdeacon of Belize (1907–1918), was formerly a curate at the parish church. 
*William Blair-Bell, founder of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, lived at Eardiston House in the parish prior to his death in 1936.

==War memorial==

The parish&#x27;s WWI war memorial is an carved cave within the sandstone cliff of the Brownhill. Located beside the road leading out of the village towards Baschurch, it is unique to Shropshire. It was conceived by the London architect Stanley Vaughan after a visit to Ruyton, and created by local father-and-son stonemasons Warwick and Len Edwards. The benches within the arch and the cross are all carved out of the rock. The memorial was unveiled in October 1920. The names of fallen from both the First and Second World Wars are listed on plaques within the archway. A third plaque, to an Alfred Rogers, was added in 2007 after he had been omitted from an earlier plaque.

==Namesake==
Ruyton Girls&#x27; School (founded 1888) in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, was named after this village; its founder, Charlotte Anderson, was great-great-granddaughter of David Evans, who was Vicar of Ruyton from 1788 to 1821.

<doc id="571805" wikidata="Q2981117" url="?curid=571805" title="Hitotsume-kozō">
<text>Hitotsume-kozō (一つ目小僧) are a &quot;Yōkai&quot; (supernatural apparition) of Japan that take on the appearance of a bald-headed child with one eye in the center of its forehead similar to a cyclops.

==Summary==
They generally do not cause any injury, are said to suddenly appear and surprise people, and are a comparatively harmless type of yōkai. By that, it can be said that their behavior could also be understood in terms of the &quot;karakasa-obake&quot;. Perhaps because they don&#x27;t perform bad deeds, when they are depicted in pictures, they are often depicted cutely, or in a humorous design.

In &quot;yōkai karuta&quot;, &quot;hitotsume-kozō&quot; are depicted carrying &quot;tōfu&quot;, but according to the &quot;yōkai&quot; researcher Katsumi Tada, since &quot; leads to &quot;, hitotsume-kozō are supposed to dislike beans, but somehow before anyone knew it the &quot;hitotsume-kozō&quot; switched to having &quot;tōfu&quot; (made from soybeans) as its favorite food. Additionally, this said to be related to the &quot;tōfu-kozō&quot;.

They take on the appearance of a &quot;kozō&quot; (a monk in training), but there is also the theory that they come from the &quot;yōkai&quot; from Mount Hiei, the said to be what the 18th Tendaizasu, Ryōgen turned into. See also Hitotsume-nyūdō.

==In classics==
They can frequently be seen in kaidan, essays, and modern folkloristics material, but the story from &quot;&quot; by Tōsaku Ikō is especially well-known. In Yotsuya, Edo, there lived a man named Ojima Yakiemon (小嶋弥喜右衛門), and headed towards the estate of the samurai family Asanuno for business, and when he waited in the room, a kozō about ten years of age appeared, and rolled up and rolled down the hanging scroll in the tokonoma over and over. When Yakiemon warned him about playing a prank, the kozō said &quot;shut up&quot; while turning around, and there was only one eye on his face. Yakiemon raised a shriek and fell down, and was sent back to his home by the people of the estate who were surprised by his voice. Afterward, according to the people of the estate, this kind of strange occurrence happens about four or five times each year, but it doesn&#x27;t particularly do anything bad. Even though Yakiemon slept for about 20 days, he returned to being as robust as he was before.

It is said that hitotsume-kozō appear more frequently outside than inside. According to the &quot;&quot;, near the in Aizuwakamatsu, a girl met a child who was eight or nine years of age who asked &quot;onee-san, do you money?&quot; and upon answering &quot;I want,&quot; the child face had only one eye, and the girl was glared at by that one eye fainted right there. Also, in the &quot;Okayama no Kaidan&quot;, at Kamimomiimaidani, Kumenan, Kume District, Okayama Prefecture, there was a hill road called , and in the past, when one walks that path at night, a bright blue light together with a hitotsume-kozō would appear, and those who are unable to stand due to surprise/fear would be licked by one mouthful of a long tongue, and this would be where the name Hitokuchizaka came from.

In yōkai depictions from the Edo period such as the Hyakkai Zukan, the &quot;Bakemono Zukushi&quot;, and the &quot;Bakemono Emaki&quot;, it was depicted under the name . Also, in Oshu, they are called &quot;hitotsu managu.&quot;

Also in rakugo, people with one eye (including children) would appear, and in the program &quot;&quot;, it told of how a charlatan heard about a one-eyed person witnessed about 120 or 130 ri north of Edo on an empty field. He went out to capture one to show as an exhibit for the sake of profit. He found a one-eyed child, and when he attempted to take him away, there was a big uproar and he was surrounded by a great number of people who captured him. All of the people were one-eyed, and it ended with &quot;how strange he is, he has two eyes&quot;, and &quot;quickly, let&#x27;s put him on exhibit&quot; (furthermore, geographically, 120 ri north of Edo would be about 470 kilometers, which would be the Iwate or Akita Prefecture).

==In folk religion==
In the Kantō region, there is the legend that on the night of , the eighth day on the second month and the eighth day of the 12th month in the lunisolar calendar, they would come from mountain villages together with a mikaribaba, and perform the custom of putting a bamboo basket in front of their house in order to drive it away. Also, depending on the region, hiiragi are used to pierce baskets, but this is what &quot;to stab one eye&quot; means in those places. On Kotoyōka, in the past there were many regions that people would not do their work and stay confined in their homes, but sometimes, this ritual of seclusion in the house was interpreted as staying in the home since monsters would appear; there is also a theory that these monsters are the hitotsume-kozō and the mikaribaba.

Also in the legends of the Kantō region, hitotsume-kozō would go around houses carrying a notebook on Kotoyōka and would investigate houses that had bad door fastenings or bad manners, and determine their fortune, or report it to the yakubyōgami and bring about misfortune. On this occasion, on the eighth day of the 12th month, the hitotsume-kozō would record in a notebook the errors of each house and temporarily hand it to the dōsojin, and since they would be retrieving it on the eighth day of the second month, and as a practice to burn away the notebook, in Seya-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, they would make a temporary shrine to the dōsojin and on the 14th day of the first month, burn it in dondoyaki. In Izu region in Shizuoka Prefecture, on the 15th day of the first month, there is the custom of burning a statue of a dōsojin in a fire in the dōsojin festival. With this, the hitotsume-kozō who was supposed to retrieve the notebook from the dōsojin on the eighth day of the second month would no longer be there, thus evading misfortune.

===Atypical gods (kami)===
Kunio Yanagita, a great authority on folkloristics, based on the thought that &quot;yōkai are gods (kami) that have come to ruin&quot;, it has been explained that hitotsume-kozō are fallen mountain gods. There are several regions that have the legend that &quot;mountain gods are cross-eyed (strabismus)&quot;, and since &quot;has one eye&quot; was a common way to say &quot;cross-eyed&quot;, this is also originated from the divine spirits of the mountain. Also, there are hints that there existed people who lost a leg and an eye as a sacrifice in old rituals, and according to hunters and lumberjacks, in a legend related to nature gods deified in the mountains, one can catch a glimpse of atypical gods that took on an appearance with one eye and one foot. Other than this, since, among those who were employed in smelting iron in a tatara there were many people who lost one eye, there is the theory that it is related to one-eyed god, Ame no Mahitotsu no Kami that people employed at iron smelting have put their faith into.

==Cyclopia==

There is an inherited deformity called cyclopia. When the mother is deficient in Vitamin A or other nutrients, the cerebrum is unable to divide to the left and right, and accompanying this there is also only one eyeball. More than just abnormalities with the brain, nerves, or respiratory system, it is a condition that results in death in the womb before even birth. Vitamin A is, other than green vegetables, also contained in many animal foods, and in Japan, which did not have much of a culture in eating meat, it might not have been strange to be deficient in Vitamin A. With this background, since hitotsume-kozō have the appearance of a child and the clothing of a young priest, it is thought that babies born with one eye were called this, which is where it started.

In Zama, Kanagawa Prefecture, in 1932 (Showa 7), a skull with only one eye socket was dug up from the cemetery inside the city, and it was presumed to have been the result of someone who was attacked by wild dogs after collapsing, and a &quot;Hitotsume-kozō Jizō&quot; was constructed as a memorial for this, and afterwards people connected it with the legend of hitotsume-kozō and conveyed between people. There is also the viewpoint that the owner of the skull had cyclopia.

<text>Princess Nine, known in Japan as , is a 26-episode Japanese anime television series and a three volume manga written and created by Kensei Date.

==Synopsis==
The series is about the trials of nine girls at the Kisaragi School for Girls who form a baseball team for the purpose of playing on equal footing with boys&#x27; teams at the most prestigious high school tournament in Japan, the National High School Baseball Championship. Their aim to qualify for, and ultimately to win, the final rounds of the tournament which is held each year at the Koshien Stadium. They are led by ace pitcher, Ryo Hayakawa, a daughter of a former pitching star in Japan who was banned from Nippon Professional Baseball.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
The team (in batting order):

# , Team #4 and second base: A former school dropout, the red-haired thug had to be tricked by Coach Kido into joining the team. She was a star athlete in track and field, and established records for both the 100 m sprint dash and javelin throw. Consequently, she fits in as the leadoff batter on the team. Seira bats and throws right-handed. .
# , Team #3 and first base: Hikaru is the energetic first baseman and switch hitter who was a former softball star recruited to the team. She is originally from Osaka (Kansai) region, which explains her accent. She was the MVP of Junior High School Softball Competition in Kansai. Hikaru throws right-handed. .
# , Team #8 and center field: The only member of the team with actual baseball experience, Koharu played for a boys&#x27; team before being found out as a girl. She grew up on the sea as a daughter of a fisherman, and has developed an extremely powerful swing, dubbed &quot;Wave Motion Swing&quot; from her years of fishing. Her batting is so strong that she occasionally hits out of the park home runs. She is originally from Tosa, a small city on the Shikoku island. Koharu bats and throws right-handed. .
# , Team #5 and third base: Izumi is the daughter of the school&#x27;s chairperson, Keiko Himuro, and was a star tennis player. However, she cast aside her talent in tennis to become Ryo&#x27;s rival in baseball. Often caustic and difficult, her only goals pertain to her success. Along with Koharu, Izumi is one of the two strongest batters of the team (she is the team&#x27;s clean up hitter), forming the primary offensive weapons of Kisaragi Girls&#x27; Baseball Team. Izumi bats and throws right-handed. .
# , Team #7 and left field: Yuki is highly mysterious and quiet, possibly not even of this world. Never without her &quot;alien&quot; companion, Fifi, whom she keeps with her at all times, Yuki is nevertheless is a superb fielder who is always in the right place at the right time. Like Hikaru, she was also MVP of the Junior High School Softball Competition in Kansai. Yuki bats and throws right-handed. .
# , Team #6 and shortstop: Kanako is an excellent baseball player and is the daughter of the school&#x27;s principal who is against the baseball team in the first half. During this, Kanako has to disguise herself as , a pseudonym which is an anagram of her name, to be able to play for the team. She has a kind of geeky attitude, and she wants to be a doctor. But she also likes baseball, and wants to play baseball during her high school years. Kanako was also previously a softball star in junior high, and Hikaru recognizes her from their previous encounters in softball games. Kanako bats and throws right-handed. .
# , Team #9 and right field: Recruited to fill a hole in the lineup, Yoko has very little athletic ability. Yoko is mostly interested in concentrating on a modeling career, but was looking to use the up-and-coming baseball team as a way to stand out from others. She is originally from Okinawa, the southernmost prefecture in Japan, which explains her tanned skin. She left her hometown, claiming it was to get rid of dozens of boys who wanted to be her boyfriend, and set her heart to a career in modeling. Yoko bats and throws right-handed. .
# , Team #2 and catcher: Plucked from the judo team, the imposing but incredibly bashful Mao is the only person who can catch Ryo&#x27;s pitches. An excellent team member when she can overcome her personal shyness. Mao bats and throws right-handed. .
# , Team #1, pitcher and captain of the Kisaragi Girls&#x27; High Baseball Team: Inheriting her father&#x27;s pitching arm, Ryo has an innate pitching ability. She is a left-handed player just like her father. She originally planned not to go to high school because she wanted to help support her mother at the family&#x27;s oden shop, but she is recruited to the Kisaragi Girls&#x27; High School to be the foundation of the new baseball team. Before playing for Kisaragi, she often played as a relief pitcher for a local sandlot baseball team, the Wildcats. .

All of the team members are excellent athletes and in great physical shape, and this explains why the team becomes such a strong one despite their physical differences. In addition to the nine players, there are two more members:

# : Team manager and part-time cheerleader, Nene is a constant bundle of energy, but knows little of the sport of baseball (learning all she knows from sports manga). A perpetual ditz, Nene is constantly interested in any hobby or ability she can discover. She also sometimes acts as a replacement coach, if Coach Kido is absent or late due to hangovers. .
# : He is a moderately lecherous drunkard who becomes the coach of Kisaragi Girls&#x27; High Baseball team. He has connections to both Keiko Himuro and Hidehiko Hayakawa from when they were all younger. In fact, he was Hidehiko&#x27;s catcher when they were in high school. Despite his very unconvincing and laidback appearance, he is actually quite an observant person, a master strategist and has superior insights and judgements in baseball games. .

===Other notable characters===
* : A star baseball player at the Kisaragi Boys&#x27; High School and son of a wealthy family, he was being groomed as a potential boyfriend and possibly fiancé of Izumi. However, Hiroki has an attraction to the spunky Ryo: he calls her &quot;Ganmo-chan&quot; (&quot;Tofu girl&quot; in the English dub) as it is his favorite part of oden. 
* : Ryo&#x27;s mother, the late Hidehiko&#x27;s wife and owner/operator of an Oden shop. Her husband died several years ago and Shino and Ryo run the shop themselves now. Shino is highly supportive of Ryo&#x27;s dreams to play baseball. 
* : Keiko is the cold and seemingly aloof President of the school and mother to Izumi. Solid in her ambitions, she forgoes seemingly everything to accomplish her plans. Her stated motivation behind the creation of the girls&#x27; baseball team is to see the pitching ability Ryo inherited from her father on the mound at Koshien Stadium. 
* : Ryo&#x27;s late father and Shino&#x27;s late husband. A left-handed, rising star pitcher in baseball many years ago, but he was banned from playing baseball for life because of a scandal he was caught up in (but had nothing to do with). He won the National High School Baseball Championship at Koshien a long time ago, and during his short stint as a pro baseball player, he won the Japan Series with the Towa Jaguars three times in a row before he was banned from baseball. He is famous for inventing and throwing the legendary Lightning Ball, an extremely powerful pitch which has struck out a lot of professional baseball players. Ryo later rediscovered the Lightning Ball with the hints from coach Kido, and she uses it as her ultimate weapon in her baseball games. 
* : Ryo&#x27;s best friend since kindergarten, and a total genius in high school. He had a crush on Ryo, but could never express it. At the end of the series, he finds himself falling for Hikaru, and she with him, even receiving his first kiss from her.

<doc id="571809" wikidata="Q654776" url="?curid=571809" title="Sadhu">
<text>Sadhu (, IAST: &quot;&quot; (male), &quot;sādhvī&quot; or &quot;sādhvīne&quot; (female)), also spelled &quot;saddhu&quot;, is a religious ascetic, mendicant or any holy person in Hinduism and Jainism who has renounced the worldly life. They are sometimes alternatively referred to as &quot; yogi&quot;, &quot;sannyasi&quot; or &quot;vairagi&quot;.

Sādhu means one who practises a &#x27;sadhana&#x27; or keenly follows a path of spiritual discipline. Although the vast majority of sādhus are yogīs, not all yogīs are sādhus. A sādhu&#x27;s life is solely dedicated to achieving mokṣa (liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth), the fourth and final aśrama (stage of life), through meditation and contemplation of Brahman. Sādhus often wear simple clothing, such as saffron-coloured clothing in Hinduism and white or nothing in Jainism, symbolising their sannyāsa (renunciation of worldly possessions). A female mendicant in Hinduism and Jainism is often called a &quot;sadhvi&quot;, or in some texts as &quot;aryika&quot;.

In Sikhism, a person who has become &quot;Brahmgiani&quot; is considered a &quot;sadhu&quot;. However, asceticism, celibacy and begging are prohibited in Sikhism. A Sikh has to be married and do an honest job for a living.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;sadhu&quot; (Sanskrit: साधु) appears in &quot;Rigveda&quot; and &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; where it means &quot;straight, right, leading straight to goal&quot;, according to Monier Monier-Williams. In the Brahmanas layer of Vedic literature, the term connotes someone who is &quot;well disposed, kind, willing, effective or efficient, peaceful, secure, good, virtuous, honourable, righteous, noble&quot; depending on the context. In the Hindu Epics, the term implies someone who is a &quot;saint, sage, seer, holy man, virtuous, chaste, honest or right&quot;.

The Sanskrit terms &quot;sādhu&quot; (&quot;good man&quot;) and &quot;sādhvī&quot; (&quot;good woman&quot;) refer to renouncers who have chosen to live lives apart from or on the edges of society to focus on their own spiritual practices.

The words come from the root &quot;sādh&quot;, which means &quot;reach one&#x27;s goal&quot;, &quot;make straight&quot;, or &quot;gain power over&quot;. The same root is used in the word sādhanā, which means &quot;spiritual practice&quot;. It literally means one who practises a ″sadhana″ or a path of spiritual discipline.

==Demographics and lifestyle==
Unlike skilled workers and professionals, there is no certification for sadhus. So, it is very difficult to determine the exact number of sadhus. According to various assumptions, there are 4 to 5 million sadhus in India today. Sadhus are widely respected for their holiness. It is also thought that the austere practices of the sadhus help to burn off their karma and that of the community at large. Thus seen as benefiting society, sadhus are supported by donations from many people. However, reverence of sadhus is by no means universal in India. For example, Nath yogi sadhus have been viewed with a certain degree of suspicion particularly amongst the urban populations of India, but they have been revered and are popular in rural India.

There are naked (digambara, or &quot;sky-clad&quot;) sadhus who wear their hair in thick dreadlocks called &quot;jata&quot;. Sadhus engage in a wide variety of religious practices. Some practice asceticism and solitary meditation, while others prefer group praying, chanting or meditating. They typically live a simple lifestyle, and have very few or no possessions. Many sadhus have rules for alms collection, and do not visit the same place twice on different days to avoid bothering the residents. They generally walk or travel over distant places, homeless, visiting temples and pilgrimage centers as a part of their spiritual practice. Celibacy is common, but some sects experiment with consensual tantric sex as a part of their practice. Sex is viewed by them as a transcendence from a personal, intimate act to something impersonal and ascetic.

==Sadhu sects==

===Hinduism===
Shaiva sadhus are renunciants devoted to Shiva, and Vaishnava sadhus are renouncers devoted to Vishnu (or his avatars, such as Rama or Krishna). The Vaishnava sadhus are sometimes referred to as &quot;vairagis&quot;. Less numerous are Shakta sadhus, who are devoted to Shakti. Within these general divisions are numerous sects and sub-sects, reflecting different lineages and philosophical schools and traditions often referred to as &quot;sampradayas&quot;. Each sampradaya has several &quot;orders&quot; called parampara based on the lineage of the founder of the order. Each sampradaya and parampara may have several monastic and martial akharas.

Within the Shaiva sadhus are many subgroups. Most Shaiva sadhus wear a Tripundra mark on their forehead, dress in saffron, red or orange-coloured clothes, and live a monastic life. Some sadhus such as the Aghori share the practices of ancient Kapalikas, in which they beg with a skull, smear their body with ashes from the cremation ground, and experiment with substances or practices that are generally abhorred by society.

Among the Shaiva sadhus, the Dashanami Sampradaya belong to the Smarta Tradition. They are said to have been formed by the philosopher and renunciant Adi Shankara, believed to have lived in the 8th century CE, though the full history of the sect&#x27;s formation is not clear. Among them are the Naga subgroups, naked sadhu known for carrying weapons like tridents, swords, canes, and spears. Said to have once functioned as an armed order to protect Hindus from the Mughal rulers, they were involved in a number of military defence campaigns. Generally in the ambit of non-violence at present, some sections are known to practice wrestling and martial arts. Their retreats are still called &quot;chhaavni&quot; or armed camps (akhara), and mock duels are still sometimes held between them.

Female sadhus (&quot;sadhvi&quot;s) exist in many sects. In many cases, the women that take to the life of renunciation are widows, and these types of sadhvis often live secluded lives in ascetic compounds. Sadhvis are sometimes regarded by some as manifestations or forms of the Goddess, or Devi, and are honoured as such. There have been a number of charismatic sadhvis that have risen to fame as religious teachers in contemporary India, e.g. Anandamayi Ma, Sarada Devi, Mata Amritanandamayi, and Karunamayi.

===Jainism===
The Jain community is traditionally discussed in its texts with four terms: &quot;sadhu&quot; (monks), &quot;sadhvi or aryika&quot; (nuns), &quot;sravaka&quot; (laymen householders) and &quot;sravika&quot; (laywomen householders). As in Hinduism, the Jain householders support the monastic community. The &quot;sadhus&quot; and &quot;sadhvis&quot; are intertwined with the Jain lay society, perform &quot;murtipuja&quot; (Jina idol worship) and lead festive rituals, and they are organized in a strongly hierarchical monastic structure.

There are differences between the Digambara and Śvetāmbara sadhus and sadhvi traditions. The Digambara sadhus own no clothes as a part of their interpretation of Five vows, and they live their ascetic austere lives in nakedness. The Digambara sadhvis wear white clothes. The Śvetāmbara sadhus and sadhvis both wear white clothes. According to a 2009 publication by Harvey J. Sindima, Jain monastic community had 6,000 sadhvis of which less than 100 belong to the Digambara tradition and rest to Śvetāmbara.

==Becoming a sadhu==

The processes and rituals of becoming a sadhu vary with sect; in almost all sects, a sadhu is initiated by a guru, who bestows upon the initiate a new name, as well as a mantra (or sacred sound or phrase), which is generally known only to the sadhu and the guru and may be repeated by the initiate as part of meditative practice.

Becoming a sadhu is a path followed by millions. It is supposed to be the fourth phase in a Hindu&#x27;s life, after studies, being a father and a pilgrim, but for most it is not a practical option. For a person to become sadhu needs vairagya. Vairagya means desire to achieve something by leaving the world (cutting familial, societal and earthly attachments).

A person who wants to become sadhu must first seek a guru. There, he or she must perform &quot;guruseva&quot; which means service. The guru decides whether the person is eligible to take sannyasa by observing the sisya (the person who wants to become a sadhu or sanyasi). If the person is eligible, &quot;guru upadesa&quot; (which means teachings) is done. Only then, the person transforms into sanyasi or sadhu. There are different types of sanyasis in India who follow different sampradya. But, all sadhus have a common goal: attaining moksha (liberation).

==Festive gatherings==
Kumbh Mela, a mass-gathering of sadhus from all parts of India, takes place every three years at one of four points along sacred rivers in India, including the holy river Ganges. In 2007 it was held in Nasik, Maharashtra. Peter Owen-Jones filmed one episode of &quot;Extreme Pilgrim&quot; there during this event. It took place again in Haridwar in 2010. Sadhus of all sects join in this reunion. Millions of non-sadhu pilgrims also attend the festivals, and the Kumbh Mela is the largest gathering of human beings for a single religious purpose on the planet. The Kumbh Mela of 2013 started on 14 January of that year at Allahabad. At the festival, sadhus appear in large numbers, including those &quot;completely naked with ash-smeared bodies, [who] sprint into the chilly waters for a dip at the crack of dawn&quot;.

<doc id="571810" wikidata="Q4503285" url="?curid=571810" title="Mandawuy Yunupingu">
<text>Mandawuy Djarrtjuntjun Yunupingu , formerly Tom Djambayang Bakamana Yunupingu, and also known as Dr Yunupingu (17 September 1956 – 2 June 2013), was a teacher and musician, and frontman of the Aboriginal rock group Yothu Yindi from 1986. He was an Aboriginal Australian man of the Yolŋu people, with a skin name of Gudjuk.

Yunupingu was a singer-songwriter and guitarist with the band. Yothu Yindi released six albums between 1989 and 2000, and their top 20 ARIA Singles Chart appearances were &quot;Treaty&quot; (1991) and &quot;Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)&quot; (1992). The band was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2012.

In 1989 Yunupingu became assistant principal of the Yirrkala Community School and was principal for the following two years. He helped establish the Yolngu Action Group and introduced the both-ways education system, which recognised traditional Aboriginal teaching alongside Western methods. His wife Yalmay Yunupingu taught alongside him at the school.

Yunupingu was appointed Australian of the Year for 1992 by the National Australia Day Council. In 1993, he was one of six Indigenous Australians who jointly presented the Boyer Lectures &quot;Voices of the Land&quot; for the International Year for the World&#x27;s Indigenous People. In April 1998, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Queensland University of Technology.

==Early life, family, and education==
Yunupingu was born as Tom Djambayang Bakamana Yunupingu on 17 September 1956 in Yirrkala, Arnhem Land, an Aboriginal reserve in the northeastern part of the Northern Territory. He was a member of the Gumatj people, one of sixteen groups of the Yolngu people. His skin name was Gudjuk, but his name was changed to Mandawuy in 1990 when a family member with the same name died, in line with Yolngu custom. He described his names as &quot;Mandawuy&quot; means &#x27;from clay&#x27;; Djarrtjuntjun means &#x27;roots of the paperbark tree that still burn and throw off heat after a fire has died down&#x27;; Yunupingu depicts a solid rock that, having travelled from freshwater, stands in salty waters, its base deep in the earth. I am Gudjuk the fire kite&quot;.

His father was Munggurrawuy Yunupingu (–1978), a Gumatj clan leader and artist. His mother, Makurrngu – one of Munggurrawuy&#x27;s 12 wives – was a member of the Galpu clan. His oldest sister, Gulumbu Yunupingu (1945 – 9 May 2012), was also an artist and healer. His other sisters are Nyapanyapa and Barrupu, who are also artists. His older brother, Galarrwuy Yunupingu (1948 – 2023), a senior elder of Arnhem Land, was Australian of the Year in 1978, and was an Indigenous land rights campaigner.

Yunupingu attended Yirrkala Community School.

==Teaching==
In 1983, Yunupingu published &quot;Outstation schools at Yirrkala&quot; in &quot;Aboriginal Child at School&quot;, where he described the advantages to Indigenous people by &quot;[determining] their own way of living, provided, they manage budgeting through Isolated Children&#x27;s Allowance, staffing their schools, developing curriculum, and teacher training&quot;. In March 1987 he contributed to the book, &quot;Educational needs of the Homelands Centres of the L̲aynhapuy Region, North East Arnhem Land : report of the Balanga ̲na Project : a Schools Commission Project of national significance&quot;.

He was the first Aboriginal person from Arnhem Land to gain a university degree, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in education from Deakin University in 1988. In 1989 he became assistant principal of the Yirrkala Community School. He helped establish the Yolngu Action Group and introduced the Both Ways system at his school, which recognised traditional Aboriginal teaching alongside Western methods. In 1990 he took over as principal of Yirrkala Community School. Also that year he authored &quot;Language and power : the Yolngu rise to power at Yirrkala School&quot;, detailing his work with Yolngu Action Group. He remained principal until late 1991, leaving to expand his musical career.

In 1992 Yunupingu worked with rock musician Jimmy Barnes on a project called &quot;Sister Schools&quot;, the aim of which was to ensure that &quot;schools with few or no Aboriginal children will forge educational and social links with schools with large numbers of Aboriginal children, in an attempt to foster tolerance and understanding&quot;. Before the launch of the project, &quot;the Yunupingu kids&quot; (Mandawuy&#x27;s children) recorded a song written by Yunupingu called &quot;School&quot; with Barnes&#x27; children in their band The Tin Lids. As part of the project, endorsed by the government, schools with few or no Aboriginal children would forge educational and social links with schools with many Aboriginal children, by exchanging letters, photographs, and other media. Around 100 schools expressed interest in the project, which was launched in August 1992 by connecting the school in Yirrkala with Gib Gate Primary School near Mittagong in New South Wales. In 1994, a primary school in Deloraine, Tasmania, hosted a group of children from Ali Curung, NT, for six days as part of the scheme.

His wife, Yalmay Yunupingu, taught at the school for around 40 years before her retirement in 2023, and was also a dedicated teacher and mentor in bilingual education.

==Yothu Yindi==
By 1985, with Yunupingu on vocals and guitar, he formed a Yolngu band including Witiyana Marika on &quot;manikay&quot; (traditional vocals), &quot;bilma&quot; (ironwood clapsticks) and dance, Milkayngu Mununggurr on &quot;yidaki&quot; (didgeridoo), and Gurrumul Yunupingu – his nephew – on keyboards, guitar and percussion. The following year the Yolngu group combined with a &quot;balanda&quot; (non-Indigenous) group, Swamp Jockeys, which had Andrew Belletty on drums, Stuart Kellaway on bass guitar and Cal Williams on lead guitar. The new collective, Yothu Yindi, performed Aboriginal rock which fused traditional indigenous music and dance with Western popular music. &quot;yothu yindi&quot; means &quot;child and mother&quot; and refers to the kinship of north-east Arnhem Land.

In the group&#x27;s early years their performing was restricted to holidays as Yunupingu completed his tertiary studies and then started work as a teacher. By 1988 Yothu Yindi had toured Australia and North America supporting Midnight Oil. Late that year they recorded their debut studio album, &quot;Homeland Movement&quot;, which appeared in March the following year. Australian musicologist, Ed Nimmervoll, described it &quot;[o]ne side comprised Midnight Oil-like politicized rock. The other side of the album concentrated on traditionally based songs like &quot;Djäpana&quot; (Sunset Dreaming), written by former teacher Mandawuy Yunupingu&quot;. He was credited on the album as Mandawuy Bakamana Yunupingu and provided vocals, guitar and &quot;bilma&quot;.

The band achieved national recognition for their single, &quot;Treaty&quot;, the remixed version was released in June 1991, which reached No. 11 on the ARIA Singles Chart and stayed in the top 50 for 20 weeks. Mandawuy and Galarrwuy had wanted a song to highlight the lack of progress on a treaty between Aboriginal peoples and the federal government. The song contains words in Gumatj, Yunupingu&#x27;s variety of Yolngu &quot;matha&quot;. It was written by Australian musician, Paul Kelly, with Yothu Yindi members Yunupingu, Kellaway, Williams, Gurrumul, Mununggurr and Marika. The associated album, &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; appeared in October 1991, which peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart. A re-recorded version of &quot;Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)&quot; was issued as the second single from the album and reached No. 13.

Yunupingu&#x27;s work on &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; was described by Allmusic&#x27;s Jonathan Lewis, &quot;[his] voice is suited perfectly to [traditional songs], but it is the rock tracks that are the weak links in this disc. Yunupingu is not a particularly good pop singer, and the music is sometimes insipid&quot;. Nevertheless both &quot;Treaty&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Djäpana (Sunset Dreaming)&quot; in 1993 charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play singles charts, with &quot;Treaty&quot; peaking at No. 6, &quot;Tribal Voice&quot; peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top World Music Albums chart in 1992. In 1991 &quot;Treaty&quot;, co-written by Yunupingu, won the inaugural Song of the Year Award at the APRA Music Awards presented by Australasian Performing Right Association. In May 2001 it was listed in the APRA Top 30 Australian songs of all time.

Yothu Yindi completed four more studio albums, &quot;Freedom&quot; (November 1993), &quot;Birrkuta - Wild Honey&quot; (November 1996), &quot;One Blood&quot; (June 1999) and &quot;Garma&quot; (November 2000). They toured Australia, North America, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong. Yunupingu strove to achieve a better understanding of Aboriginal culture by &quot;balanda&quot; and was a prominent advocate of reconciliation between all Australians.

Yunupingu and the band established the Yothu Yindi Foundation in 1990 and since 1999 promoted the annual Garma Festival. From May 2007 the foundation has supported the &quot;Dilthan Yolngunha&quot; (Healing Place), which uses traditional healing practices and mainstream medicine.

==Recognition and awards==
* On 26 January 1993, Yunupingu was named Australian of the Year for 1992 by the National Australia Day Council.
* In 1993, Yunupingu&#x27;s friend, filmmaker Stephen Maxwell Johnson (&quot;Yolngu Boy&quot;, &quot;High Ground&quot;), made a feature-length documentary about him, called &quot;Tribal Voice&quot;.
* In April 1998 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Queensland University of Technology, &quot;in recognition of his significant contribution to the education of Aboriginal children, and to greater understanding between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians&quot;.
* On 1 January 2001, Yunupingu awarded the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society through music.
* Yunupingu was inducted into the NT Hall of Fame at the NT Indigenous Music Awards 2004. Yothu Yindi were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in December 2012, with Peter Garrett (frontman of Midnight Oil) and Paul Kelly introducing the group.
* In the 2014 Australia Day Honours, Yunupingu was posthumously invested as a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), for eminent service to the performing arts as a musician and songwriter, to the advancement of education and social justice for Indigenous people, and as an advocate for cultural exchange and understanding.

==Death and legacy==
Yunupingu died on 2 June 2013, aged 56 following a long battle with kidney disease. After his death, the Prime Minister of Australia at the time, Julia Gillard, said: &quot;We have today lost a great Australian voice in the efforts towards reconciliation.&quot;

In June 2014, the annual Dr Yunupingu Award for Human Rights was created as one of three awards at the newly-established National Indigenous Human Rights Awards in Sydney, New South Wales. His wife Yalmay delivered one of the keynote speeches at the inaugural awards ceremony on 24 June.

On 17 September 2020, Google celebrated Yunupingu&#x27;s 64th birthday with a Google Doodle.

==Personal life and family==
Yunupingu was married to a fellow teacher, Yalmay Marika Yunupingu of the Rirritjingu clan, also referred to as Yalmay Marika and Yalmay Yunupingu. He is survived by five daughters and five grandsons.

Yunupingu was friends with musician Jimmy Barnes, with the men working together on &quot;Sister Schools&quot;, a federal government program initiated by Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert
Tickner, which aimed to link Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal schoolchildren around the country. The children of both men sang together as The Tin Lids and The Yunupingu Kids, on a song called &quot;School&quot; in August 1992.

One of his grandsons, Rrawun Maymuru, is lead singer of East Journey. In May 2013, the National Indigenous Music Awards announced that Yothu Yindi were to be honoured at their awards ceremony in August, in which Maymuru was to be backed by original band members. Yunupingu declared &quot;My heart is full of joy. I am so happy to see that in my lifetime Indigenous music has come such a long way. And to have these talented artists come together to honour the groundbreaking work of Yothu Yindi makes me proud beyond words. Yow Manymak.&quot;

His nephew Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu also played in Yothu Yindi. Gurrumul later formed the Saltwater Band and also had a solo career. Other members of the extended Yunupingu family have also performed in Yothu Yindi: Galarrwuy (guitars and vocals); Mangatjay (dance); Yomunu; Gapanbulu (&quot;yidaki&quot;); Gavin Makuma (&quot;yidaki&quot;, &quot;bilma&quot;, vocals); Malngay Kevin (&quot;yidaki&quot;, &quot;bilma&quot;, dancer, vocals); and Narripapa Nicky (&quot;yidaki&quot;, dancer). His nephew, Gavin Makuma Yunupingu, was jailed in 2002 over the death of Betsy Yunupingu, his cousin. Another nephew, Nicky Yunupingu, died by suicide in July 2008.

===Health===
Yunupingu was diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure, which in turn contributed to advanced kidney failure, for which he received haemodialysis three times a week in Darwin. His condition was announced in 2007 following his attendance in January at a rehabilitation clinic after years of beer drinking – between one and four cartons (i.e. two to eight gallons, or 9 to 36 litres) daily, according to his psychiatrist. By December 2008 he was resigned to the fact that he may die without having seen the longed-for settlement between white and black Australia:

By October 2009 he was on a kidney transplant waiting list. He also undertook traditional healing practices. His sister Gulumbu was one of a group of senior Yolngu women who had helped set up &quot;Dilthan Yolngunha&quot; – a healing place – with the support of the Yothu Yindi Foundation. Yunupingu was one of its first patients.

<doc id="571815" wikidata="Q1458863" url="?curid=571815" title="Rokurokubi">
<text>Rokurokubi (ろくろ首, 轆轤首) is a type of Japanese &quot;yōkai&quot; (apparition). They look almost completely like humans with some differences. There is a type whose neck stretches and another whose head detaches and flies around freely (&quot;nukekubi&quot;). The &quot;Rokurokubi&quot; appear in classical &quot;kaidan&quot; (spirit tales) and in &quot;yōkai&quot; works.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;rokurokubi&quot; may have derived from the word &quot;rokuro&quot; which refers to a potter&#x27;s wheel, a water well&#x27;s pulley (since it elongates) or an umbrella handle (which also elongates).

== Head flight ==

The nukekubi are rokurokubi whose heads come off and float about. These were the last of the rokurokubi whereas the other kind came before. Nukekubi sometimes perform bad deeds such as attacking at night and drinking their victims&#x27; blood. It is theorized that the nukekubi has a weakness when it is sleeping and the head is floating around: if the body moves, then the head cannot be re-united to the body. Classical literature about rokurokubi describe tales of people witnessing and encountering floating heads at night time.

Sometimes, the action of the head separating from the body is seen as the soul wandering away from the body, i.e. somnambulism. For example, in the &quot;Sorori Monogatari&quot; (曾呂利物語, 1663 CE), in the chapter &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Wild Thoughts Wandering Around&quot; (女の妄念迷ひ歩く事, &quot;Onna no Mōnen Mayoiaruku Koto&quot;) the head separating from the body interpreted to be the woman&#x27;s soul wandering while asleep. In the same book, a man saw a nukekubi that changed into a chick and a woman&#x27;s head, so he took his sword and chased the head. The head fled into a home and people said that they heard a voice from inside say, &quot;I had a scary dream. I was chased by a man with a sword. I ran away all the way back home and then I woke up.&quot; (refer to picture).

A different story appears in Shokoku Hyaku Monogatari (諸国百物語, 1677 CE) which drew a lot of inspiration from the Sorori Monogatari. In &quot;About Rokurokubi in the Province of Echizen&quot; (ゑちぜんの国府中ろくろ首の事, &quot;Echizen no Kuni Fuchū Rokurokubi no Koto&quot;), there is a story of a man who chases a nukekubi (who was a woman&#x27;s soul detached from her body) all the way home. It is said that the woman had been shamed by a crime she has committed, so as a result, she left her husband, shaved her hair, and committed suicide.

&quot;Hokusō Sadan&quot; (北窻瑣談, 1910 CE) is an Edo period essay by Tachibana Nankei (橘春暉). Here too, it was interpreted to be an illness resulting in a detaching soul. The story goes: in the first year of Kansei, in Echigo Province (now Fukui Prefecture), there was a house maidservant whose head rolled off the pillow while she was asleep, detached from the body. Later in the story, it was explained that it was not really the head, but rather the soul making the appearance of a head.

In &quot;Kokon Hyaku Monogatari Hyōban&quot; (古今百物語評判, 1686 CE), a book of ghost stories that explains yōkai tales by Yamaoka Genrin, there is a chapter called &quot;How Priest Zetsugan saw Rokurokubi in Higo&quot; (絶岸和尚肥後にて轆轤首を見給ふ事, &quot;Zetsugan Oshō Higo nite Rokurokubi wo Mitamou Koto&quot;). In Higo Province (now Kumamoto Prefecture), the head of an innkeeper&#x27;s wife leaves her body and floats in the air. It returned to normal the next day, but there was a line around her neck. The author made references to examples from Chinese books and then commented &quot;as these kinds of things were often seen in South-East Asia, not just limited to the creation of the heaven and earth, it is difficult to fathom them with ordinary common sense such as the idea that octopuses do not have eyes and as these things are unheard of in the capital, everything strange is in faraway lands.&quot; In the same book, there is a story which tells of a woman in the village of Tawa, Nagao, Ōkawa District, Kagawa Prefecture (now Sanuki) who is a rokurokubi and has a ring-like bruise around her neck.

In the &quot;Churyō Manroku&quot; (中陵漫録) is a tale which describes a &quot;Rokurokubi Village&quot; in the recesses of Mount Yoshino where all the residents, even children, wore scarves to cover a line around their necks.

In the &quot;Kasshi Yawa&quot; (甲子夜話, c. 1821 CE) by Matsura Seizan is a story which tells of a woman in Hitachi Province who has a terminal illness. A peddler has told her husband that the liver of a white dog will cure her. The husband kills the pet dog and gives his wife the dog&#x27;s liver as a medicant. The woman is cured but her next-born daughter is a rokurokobi. When the rokurokubi&#x27;s head detached and flew in the air, the white dog appeared, bit the head and killed the rokurokobi.

Although rokurokubi and nukekubi are usually female, in &quot;Shousai Hikki&quot; (蕉斎筆記), an Edo period tale, there is a nukekubi that is male. A priest is sleeping in his temple when a head appeared and approached his chest. He grabs it and throws it away and it left. In the morning, the manservant asks to take leave and when asked why, the manservant asks, &quot;did a head come visit last night?&quot; The priest answered yes, the manservant then explained that &quot;I have the nukekubi illness and I fear it will interfere with my work too much from now on.&quot; The manservant went away to his home in Shimōsa Province where this &quot;illness&quot; was thought to be common.

In the essay &quot;Mimibukuro&quot; by Negishi Shizumori, a woman who was rumored to be a rokurokubi is married, but manages to live well since the rumor was nothing more than a rumor. She was not actually a rokurokubi, so she achieved a happy ending, which is unusual for tales about rokurokubi because bad fortune almost always results when the true identity of a rokurokubi is discovered.

In the Edo period encyclopedia, &quot;Wakan Sansai Zue&quot; Rokuokubi like creatures from Chinese lore are described. They are written as 飛頭蛮 meaning &quot;flying head barbarians&quot;. They use their ears like wings and they eat insects. The ones from China and Japan were believed to be foreigners. The foreigner nukekubi also appears in &quot;Rokurokubi&quot; by Lafcadio Hearn. In his story, the spirits masquerade as a family of woodcutters from the city who kill and eat travelers and mostly men.

== Neck extension ==
Starting in the Edo period, tales were written about people&#x27;s necks stretching when they were asleep. Examples of these tales are &quot;Buya Zokuda&quot; (武野俗談), &quot;Kanden Kōhitsu&quot; (閑田耕筆) and &quot;Yasō Kidan&quot; (夜窓鬼談).

It is thought that the idea of an extending neck originated from people misinterpreting visual depictions of nukekubi, the earlier kind of rokurokubi. There was the idea that nukekubi had a string attaching the head to the body and when this string was depicted in visual depictions, people misinterpreted this string as an elongated neck.

In the &quot;Kasshi Yawa&quot; (甲子夜話), there is a tale which tells of a female servant with a pale face who is suspected to be a rokurokubi. One night, her master checks on her while she is sleeping and sees something like steam gradually rise from her chest. The steam becomes thick and obscures her head and then suddenly it appears as though her neck has risen up and stretched. Perhaps due to being surprised from seeing her master, the girl stirs, turns over and her neck returned to normal. This servant had a pale face, but otherwise looked completely normal, but despite this, she was fired and in fact has had trouble staying in any job, always being fired shortly after being employed. For the soul to leave the body and create the shape of a neck, as seen in this story and the before mentioned Hokusō Sadan, is sometimes interpreted to be &quot;ectoplasm&quot; in parapsychology.

In the late Edo period &quot;yomihon&quot; (illustrated novel), &quot;Rekkoku Kaidan Kikigaki Zōshi&quot; (列国怪談聞書帖) by Jippensha Ikku the author suggests the elongated necks of rokurokubi originate in the spiritual principle, &quot;karma&quot;. In Ikku&#x27;s work, &quot;Kaishin&quot;, a monk from Enshū and a woman called Oyotsu elope together. However, when Oyotsu collapsed from an illness, they ran out of money, so he killed her. When Kaishin eventually returned to secular life, he slept with a girl he met at an inn. When they sleep together, the girl&#x27;s neck stretched and her face becomes that of Oyotsu, who then told him about her resentment. Kaishin felt regretful of his actions and proceeded to tell Oyotsu&#x27;s father everything. The girl&#x27;s father then told Kaishin that he has also killed a woman before. He stole her money and with it, he opened his inn. He had a daughter soon after who, due to karma, became a rokurokubi. Kaishin then reentered the priesthood. He built a grave for Oyotsu, said to be the Rokurokubi no Tsuka (Rokurokubi Mound), which told the story to future generations.

In some stories, rokurokubi are not a yōkai, but rather people who have an affliction that affects the body. For example, the Edo period author Ban Kōkei in his work &quot;Kanden Kōhitsu&quot; told a tale of a geisha at the Yoshiwara brothel whose neck would elongate in her sleep. It stated that her neck stretched due to her &quot;heart becoming loose&quot;.

== Oral tradition ==
Rokurokobi also appear in the oral tradition of Japanese myths. For example, there is a myth about an old highway between the villages of Iwa and Akechi in Gifu Prefecture where it is said that a snake shapeshifted into a rokurokubi. Another example is a myth from the oral tradition of the Koikubo area of Iida, Nagano Prefecture where it is said a rokurokubi appeared in someone&#x27;s home.

In the Bunka period, a kaidan story became popular, where there was a prostitute whose neck would smoothly stretch and would lick the oil of paper lanterns when she slept with guests, showing how rokurokubi were spoken of as things that women would transform into or an illness that they would be afflicted with. In this period, rokurokubi were also popular in freak shows. The &quot;Shohō Kenbunroku&quot; (諸方見聞録) records a freak show in 1810 (Bunka 7) in Edo, now Tokyo where a male rokurokubi with an elongated neck appeared.

Tales of rokurokubi appeared even in the early Meiji period. There was a tale of how a merchant and his wife from Shibaya town, Ibaraki, Osaka Prefecture who witnessed their daughter&#x27;s neck stretch every night. Despite their supplications in Shinto and Buddhism, their daughter did not get better and eventually the whole town learned of it. The couple couldn&#x27;t bear it anymore, so they left, leaving no clues as to where they went.

== Magic shows ==
The rokurokubi is also a kind of Japanese magic trick using curtains and life-sized dolls without heads. It&#x27;s reported that a doll without a head wearing a kimono in seiza is put in front of the curtain. There&#x27;s a rope behind the curtain and a female performer connected to it who shows only her face. As she stands and squats, the fake neck would stretch and contract, as if it were a rokurokubi.

Explanations and pictures about what&#x27;s behind this trick were written in magazines of the Meiji period (1800s), giving a date for how early these shows first appeared. This was a time period when mystery phenomena were vigorously exposed by the scientifically-minded, so for magic tricks to be revealed is fitting with the zeitgeist.

In the Taishō period, there were businesses arranging rokurokubi to appear in show tents in festivals and fairs at temples and shrines and they were quite popular.

== Similar tales from other nations ==
The type of rokurokubi whose necks separate from the rest of the body is said to have derived from stories of the Chinese yōkai, the &quot;hitōban&quot; (飛頭蛮) a yōkai whose head separates from the body and floats about. Like the rokurokobi, the hitoban has a line around its neck. Chinese stories also tell of a yōkai called a &quot;rakutō&quot; (落頭) whose head comes off and floats about while the torso remains at rest on the futon. There is a tale that in the Three Kingdoms period, an Eastern Wu general, Zhu Huan employed a female servant who was a rakutō. It&#x27;s said that she used its ears like wings. Another tale relates that in the Qin era, there was a clan from the south called &quot;rakutōmin&quot; (落頭民) who could fly around with only their heads.

There are legends of creatures including Palasik, Kuyang, and Leyak from Indonesia, Penanggalan in Malaysia, and Krasue in Thailand. The heads of these creatures would separate from the body and float about with the entrails attached.

The Chonchon is a mythical creature of South America which takes the form of a human head flying around in the air, sucking the life out of people.

The &quot;manananggal&quot; is a creature of Philippines mythology. This female monster is slightly different since its whole body from the waist up detaches and grows giant bat-like wings.

The yōkai researcher, Tada Katsumi states that these stories arrived in Japan in the Muromachi to Azuchi-Momoyama periods, when there was still trade with southern China and Southeast Asia. In the Edo period, when Japan adopted an isolationist policy an original Japanese yōkai, the &quot;rokurokubi&quot; evolved.

<doc id="571816" wikidata="Q265488" url="?curid=571816" title="Campylobacter jejuni">
<text>Campylobacter jejuni is a species of pathogenic bacteria that is commonly associated with poultry, and is also often found in animal feces. This species of microbe is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in Europe and in the US, with the vast majority of cases occurring as isolated events rather than mass outbreaks. Active surveillance through the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) indicates that about 20 cases are &quot;diagnosed&quot; each year for each 100,000 people in the US, while many more cases are undiagnosed or unreported; the CDC estimates a total of 1.5 million infections every year. The European Food Safety Authority reported 246,571 cases in 2018, and estimated approximately nine million cases of human campylobacteriosis per year in the European Union. In Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, data indicates that &quot;C. jejuni&quot; infections are endemic.

&quot;Campylobacter&quot; is a genus of bacteria that is among the most common causes of bacterial infections in humans worldwide. Campylobacter means &quot;curved rod&quot;, deriving from the Greek &quot;kampylos &quot;(curved) and &quot;baktron&quot; (rod). Of its many species, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is considered one of the most important from both a microbiological and public health perspective.

&quot;C. jejuni&quot; is commonly associated with poultry, and is also commonly found in animal feces. Campylobacter is a helical-shaped, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative, microaerophilic, nonfermenting motile bacterium with a single flagellum at one or both poles, which are also oxidase-positive and grow optimally at 37 to 42 °C. When exposed to atmospheric oxygen, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is able to change into a coccal form. This species of pathogenic bacteria is one of the most common causes of human gastroenteritis in the world. Food poisoning caused by &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species can be severely debilitating, but is rarely life-threatening. It has been linked with subsequent development of Guillain–Barré syndrome, which usually develops two to three weeks after the initial illness. Individuals with recent &quot;C. jejuni&quot; infections develop Guillain-Barré syndrome at a rate of 0.3 per 1000 infections, about 100 times more often than the general population. Another chronic condition that may be associated with campylobacter infection is reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is a complication strongly associated with a particular genetic make-up. That is, persons who have the human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) are most susceptible. Most often, the symptoms of reactive arthritis will occur up to several weeks after infection.

== History ==
&quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; was originally named &quot;Vibrio jejuni&quot; due to its likeness to &quot;Vibrio spp.&quot; until 1963. Seabald and Vernon proposed the genus &quot;Campylobacter&quot; due to its low levels of guanine and cytosine, non-fermentative metabolism, and microaerophilic growth requirements. The first well recorded incident of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infection occurred in 1938. &quot;Campylobacter&quot; found in milk caused diarrhea among 355 inmates in two state institutions in Illinois. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; was first discovered in the small intestines of humans in the 1970s, however, symptoms have been noted since the early 20th century. The CDC, USDA and FDA collectively identified &quot;C. jejuni&quot; as responsible for over 40% of bacterial gastroenteritis found in laboratories as of 1996.

== Metabolism ==
&quot;C. jejuni&quot; is unable to use sugars as a carbon source, primarily using amino acids for growth instead. The main reason &quot;C. jejuni&quot; lacks glycolytic capabilities is a lack of glucokinase and a lack of the 6-phosphofructokinase enzyme to employ the EMP pathway. The four main amino acids &quot;C. jejuni&quot; takes in are serine, aspartate, asparagine, and glutamate, which are listed in order of preference. If all of these are depleted, some strains can use proline as well. Either the host or metabolic activity of other gut microbes can supply these amino acids.

The metabolic pathways &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is capable of include the TCA cycle, a non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid synthesis. Serine is the most important amino acid used for growth, brought into the cell by SdaC transport proteins and further broken down into pyruvate by the SdaA dehydratase. Though this pyruvate cannot directly be converted into phosphoenolpyruvic acid (as &quot;C. jejuni&quot; lacks this synthetase), the pyruvate can enter the TCA cycle to form oxaloacetic acid intermediates that can be converted to phosphoenolpyruvic acid for gluconeogenesis. This production of carbohydrates is important for the virulence factors of &quot;C. jejuni&quot;. The pyruvate created from serine can also be converted to acetyl CoA and be applied to fatty acid synthesis or continue into the TCA cycle to create precursors for other biosynthetic pathways. Aspartate and glutamate are both brought into the cell via Peb1A transport proteins. Glutamate can be transaminated into aspartate, and aspartate can be deaminated to make fumerate that feeds into the TCA cycle as well. Asparagine is also able to be deaminated into aspartate (which follows the process into the TCA cycle mentioned above). While the amino acids listed above are able to be metabolized, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is capable of taking in many of the other amino acids which helps to lower the anabolic cost of de novo synthesis.

If other sources of carbon are exhausted, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; can also use acetate and lactate as carbon sources. Acetate is a normal secreted byproduct of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; metabolism stemming from the recycling of CoA, and the absence of other carbon sources can cause &quot;C. jejuni&quot; to &quot;switch&quot; this reaction to take in acetate for the conversion to acetyl-CoA (catalyzed by phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase enzymes). Lactate is a normal byproduct of many fermentative bacteria in the gut, and &quot;C. jejuni&quot; can take in and oxidize this lactate to supply pyruvate through the activity of dehydrogenase iron-sulfur enzyme complexes.

The energetic needs of these anabolic pathways are met in multiple ways. The cytochrome c and quinol terminal oxidases allow for &quot;C. jejuni&quot; to use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor for the reduced carriers produced through the TCA cycle (hence why &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is considered an obligate microaerophile). The conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate mentioned above has substrate-level phosphorylation take place, giving another form of energy production without the use of microaerophilic respiration.

&quot;C. jejuni&quot; can use many different electron donors for its metabolic processes, using NADH and FADH most commonly – though &quot;C. jejuni&quot; uses NADH poorly compared to FADH due to a replacement of genes encoding subunits for NADH dehydrogenases for genes contributing to processes relating to FADH electron donation. Aside from these donors, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; can turn to products from the host gut microbiota including hydrogen, lactate, succinate, and formate to contribute electrons; formate, for example, is generated through intestinal mixed-acid fermentation. Unlike almost all other &quot;Campylobacter&quot; or &quot;Helicobacter&quot; species, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; can also accept electrons from sulfite and metabisulfite through its cytochrome c oxidoreductase system.

While oxygen is mainly used as a terminal electron acceptor, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; can use nitrate, nitrite, sulfur oxides (such as dimethyl sulfoxide or trimethylamine N-oxide), or fumarate as terminal electron acceptors as well to survive as a microaerophilic bacterium. Due to oxygen-limited conditions in the common areas of colonization, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; possesses two separate terminal oxidases with different affinities for oxygen, where the low affinity oxidase can directly retrieve electrons from menaquinones. The adaptations allowing for multiple electron acceptors help to combat the problem with reactive oxygen species arising from the sole use of oxygen as well; &quot;C. jejuni&quot; cannot grow under strictly aerobic conditions. Enzymes &quot;C. jejuni&quot; carries to impede the effects of reactive oxygen species include: superoxide dismutase SodB, alkyl hydroxide reductase AhpC, catalase KatA, and thiol peroxidases Tpx and Bcp.

== Disease ==

Campylobacteriosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus &quot;Campylobacter&quot;. In most patients presenting with campylobacteriosis, symptoms develop within two to five days of exposure to the organism and illness typically lasts seven days following onset. Infection with &quot;C. jejuni&quot; typically results in enteritis, or inflammation of the small intestine, which is characterized by abdominal pain, voluminous diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and malaise. Individuals infected with this bacteria can experience a prodromal phase of symptoms for the first 1 to 3 days, in which the more severe portion of the disease occurs. The prodromal phase presents with symptoms including rigors, high fever, body aches, and dizziness. Other than the prodromal phase, the acute diarrheal phase of enteritis usually lasts around 7 days, however abdominal pain can persist for weeks afterward. The disease is usually self-limiting; however, it does respond to antibiotics. Severe (accompanying fevers, blood in stools) or prolonged cases may require erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or norfloxacin. Fluid replacement via oral rehydration salts may be needed and intravenous fluid may be required for serious cases. Possible complications of campylobacteriosis include Guillain–Barré syndrome and reactive arthritis.

== Transmission ==
&quot;C. jejuni&quot; is a zoonotic disease meaning it is more commonly spread from animals to people than in between humans. People most often contract it by touching something that has been in contact with raw or undercooked chicken in addition to eating or touching poultry that is raw or undercooked. Additionally, it can also be obtained from being in contact with animals or eating undercooked seafood. The fecal oral route is the most common way it spreads as the bacterium is excreted in animal feces. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; seldomly causes disease in animals and infections are more common in lower income countries. Deadly infections are not often seen in young adults but rather among the young and elderly. Due to poor sanitation practices in some areas, the bacteria can also be found in ice and water. It is difficult to know the science behind its transmission due to its sporadic nature. The use of antibiotics and other treatments help in slowing and preventing the transmission of &quot;C. jejuni.&quot; &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is a fastidious microaerophiles meaning it does need some oxygen to grow, spread, and transmit. However, it is highly adaptable and has adapted to grow in higher concentrations of oxygen.

== Pathogenesis ==
&quot;C. jejuni&quot; employs unique strategies to breach the intestinal epithelial layer of its host cells. It uses proteases, particularly HtrA, to cleverly disrupt cell junctions and temporarily traverse the cells. The membrane-bound protein Fibronectin is a critical binding site for &quot;C. jejuni&quot; on the basolateral side of the polarized epithelial cell, facilitating this process. Once inside the cell, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; leverages dynein to access the perinuclear space within the Clathrin-Coated Vesicle, avoiding lysosomal digestion for up to 72 hours.

To initiate infection, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; must penetrate the gut enterocytes. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; releases several different toxins, mainly enterotoxin and cytotoxins, which vary from strain to strain and correlate with the severity of the enteritis (inflammation of the small intestine). During infection, levels of all immunoglobulin classes rise. Of these, IgA is the most important because it can cross the gut wall. IgA immobilises organisms, causing them to aggregate and activate complement, and also gives short-term immunity against the infecting strain of organism. The bacteria colonize the small and large intestines, causing inflammatory diarrhea with fever. Stools contain leukocytes and blood. The role of toxins in pathogenesis is unclear. &quot;C jejuni&quot; antigens that cross-react with one or more neural structures may be responsible for triggering the Guillain–Barré syndrome.

Hypoacylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from &quot;C. jejuni&quot; induces moderate TLR4-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages and such LPS bioactivity may eventually result in the failure of local and systemic bacterial clearance in patients. At the same time, moderation of anti-bacterial responses may be advantageous for infected patients in clinical practice, since such an attenuated LPS may not be able to induce severe sepsis in susceptible individuals.

One of the most important virulence factors of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; are flagella. The flagellar protein FlaA has been proven to be one of the abundant proteins in the cell. Flagella are required for motility, biofilm formation, host cell interactions and host colonization. The flagella in &quot;C. jejuni&quot; can also aid in the secretion intracellular proteins. The production of flagella is energetically costly so the production must be regulated from metabolic standpoint. CsrA is a post-transcriptional regulator that regulates the expression of FlaA by binding to &quot;flaA&quot; mRNA and is able to repress its translation. &quot;CsrA&quot; mutant strains have been studied and the mutant strains exhibit dysregulation of 120–150 proteins that are included in motility, host cell adherence, host cell invasion, chemotaxis, oxidative stress resistance, respiration and amino acid and acetate metabolism. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of flagellar synthesis in &quot;C. jejuni&quot; enables proper biosynthesis of flagella and it is important for pathogenesis of this bacteria.

&quot;C. jejuni&quot; employs a highly sophisticated navigation system called chemotaxis. This system is crucial when the bacterium requires guidance through chemical signals. The chemotaxis system uses specific chemoattractants that direct the bacterium toward areas with a higher concentration of the attractants. The exact nature of chemoattractants is dependent on the surrounding environmental conditions. Additionally, when the bacterium needs to move away, it uses negative chemotaxis to move in the opposite direction. 

Other important virulence factors of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; include the &quot;pgl&quot; locus, which confers the ability to produce &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation of at least 22 bacterial proteins, at least some of which appear to be important for competence, host adherence and invasion. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; secretes Campylobacter invasive antigens (Cia), which facilitate invasion. The bacteria also produce cytolethal distending toxins that participate in cell cycle control and induction of host cell apoptosis. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; also exploits different adaptation strategies in which the host factors seem to play a role for pathogenesis of this bacteria.

=== DNA repair===
In the intestines, bile functions as a defensive barrier against colonization by &quot;C. jejuni&quot;. When &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is grown in a medium containing the bile acid deoxycholic acid, a component of bile, the DNA of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; is damaged by a process involving oxidative stress. To survive, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; cells repair this DNA damage by a system employing proteins AddA and AddB that are needed for repair of DNA double-strand breaks.

&quot;C. jejuni&quot; uses homologous recombination to repair its DNA, facilitated by the AddA and AddB proteins. These proteins replace RecBCD, which is used in other bacteria like &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. AddA and AddB are crucial for nuclease, helicase, and Chi recognition, which allow for successful homologous recombination. 

When AddA and AddB are introduced into a wild &quot;C. jejuni&quot; variant, an added deletion mutant gene &quot;addAB&quot; gene is formed, which repairs DNA damaged by oxidative stress. This inclusion protects &quot;C. jejuni&quot; from deoxycholate found in bile, allowing for survival. However, the added gene is absent during growth in deoxycholate from 10 to 16 hours and may be up-regulated in response to environmental conditions. Additionally, AddAB proteins enhance &quot;C. jejuni&quot; colonization of chicken intestines.

===Immune response ===
&quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; infection and eventual destruction of host cell cause the release of chemokines that cause inflammation and activate immune response cells. Inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL1, CCL3/CCL4, CCL2, and CXCL10 are upregulated, further triggering the immune response. The immune response activation is primarily driven by the use of ADP-heptoses to activate ALPK1, by a &quot;C. jejuni&quot; infection

Neutrophil granulocytes use phagocytosis to combat &quot;C. jejuni&quot; infection, releasing antimicrobial proteins and proinflammatory substances. However, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; can influence the differentiation process of specific types of neutrophil granulocytes, triggering hypersegmentation and increased reactivity, which leads to delayed apoptosis and higher production of reactive oxygen species. In experimental processes, T cells from an immune response only start to grow in number at the inflammation site from the seventh day after infection.

After 11 days of having a &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; infection, the B lymphocytes in the body increase the production of antibodies that specifically fight against &quot;C. jejuni&quot; flagellin. The persistence of these antibodies in the body can last up to one-year post-infection. In this case, the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is associated with autoimmune IgG1 antibodies.

Campylobacter infections often precede GBS, indicating that molecular mimicry between the bacteria and host nervous tissues may be the underlying cause. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; , the most common causative agent of human campylobacteriosis, can survive in the gut for several days but does not establish a long-term infection due to its low replication rate, which is incompatible with a persistent bacterial presence. The bacteria-induced apoptosis of infected gut cells results in the rapid clearance of the pathogen, which likely contributes to the self-limiting nature of the disease.

== Sources ==
&quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; is commonly associated with poultry, and it naturally colonises the digestive tract of many bird species. All types of poultry and wild birds can become colonized with campylobacter. One study found that 30% of European starlings in farm settings in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, were carriers of &quot;C. jejuni&quot;. It is also common in cattle, and although it is normally a harmless commensal of the gastrointestinal tract in these animals, it can cause campylobacteriosis in calves. It has also been isolated from wombat and kangaroo feces, being a cause of bushwalkers&#x27; diarrhea. Contaminated drinking water and unpasteurized milk provide an efficient means for distribution. Contaminated food is a major source of isolated infections, with incorrectly prepared meat and poultry as the primary source of the bacteria. Moreover, surveys show that 20 to 100% of retail chickens are contaminated. This is not overly surprising, since many healthy chickens carry these bacteria in their intestinal tracts and often in high concentrations, up to 108 cfu/g. The bacteria contaminate the carcasses due to poor hygiene during the slaughter process. Several studies have shown increased concentrations of campylobacter on the carcasses after the evisceration. Studies have investigated the chicken microbiome to understand how, why and when campylobacter appears within the chicken gut. The impact of industrial system production systems on the chicken gut microbiome and campylobacter prevalence has also been investigated.

Raw milk is also a source of infections. The bacteria are often carried by healthy cattle and by flies on farms. Unchlorinated water may also be a source of infections. However, properly cooking chicken, pasteurizing milk, and chlorinating drinking water kill the bacteria. While salmonella is transmitted vertically in eggs, campylobacter is not. Therefore, consumption of eggs does result in human infection from campylobacter.

==Complications ==
Local complications of campylobacter infections occur as a result of direct spread from the gastrointestinal tract and can include cholecystitis, pancreatitis, peritonitis, and massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Extraintestinal manifestations of campylobacter infection are quite rare and may include meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and neonatal sepsis. Bacteremia is detected in &lt;1% of patients with campylobacter enteritis and is most likely to occur in patients who are immunocompromised or among the very young or very old. Transient bacteremia in immunocompetent hosts with &quot;C. jejuni&quot; enteritis may be more common but not detected because the killing action rapidly clears most normal human serotypes, and blood cultures are not routinely performed for patients with acute gastrointestinal illness.

Serious systemic illness caused by campylobacter infection rarely occurs, but can lead to sepsis and death. The case-fatality rate for campylobacter infection is 0.05 per 1000 infections. For instance, one major possible complication that &quot;C. jejuni&quot; can cause is Guillain–Barré syndrome, which induces neuromuscular paralysis in a sizeable percentage of those who suffer from it. Over time, the paralysis is typically reversible to some extent; nonetheless, about 20% of patients with GBS are left disabled, and around 5% die. Another chronic condition that may be associated with campylobacter infection is reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is a complication strongly associated with a particular genetic make-up. That is, persons who have the human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) are most susceptible. Most often, the symptoms of reactive arthritis will occur up to several weeks after infection.

== Epidemiology ==
=== Frequency ===
==== United States ====
An estimated 2 million cases of campylobacter enteritis occur annually, accounting for 5–7% of cases of gastroenteritis. Campylobacter has a large animal reservoir, with up to 100% of poultry, including chickens, turkeys, and waterfowl, having asymptomatic intestinal infections. The major reservoirs of &quot;C. fetus&quot; are cattle and sheep. More than 90% of campylobacter infections occur during the summer months due to undercooked meats from outdoor cooking. Nonetheless, the incidence of campylobacter infections has been declining. Changes in the incidence of culture-confirmed &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infections have been monitored by the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) since 1996. In 2010, campylobacter incidence showed a 27% decrease compared with 1996–1998. In 2010, the incidence was 13.6 cases per 100,000 population, and this did not change significantly compared with 2006–2008.

==== Europe ====
In 2020, there were around 120,000 cases of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; infection, which showed a decline of about 25.4% compared to the previous year. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced this decrease, and its statistical significance is yet to be determined. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; infections tend to peak in July, which could be linked to the rise in temperature worldwide. This pattern is associated with an increased reflection rate of the bacteria, which needs further investigation to establish any potential correlations.

==== Globally ====
&quot;Campylbacter jejuni&quot; infections are extremely common worldwide, although exact figures are not available. New Zealand reported the highest national rate, which peaked in May 2006 at 400 per 100,000 population. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; infection is a significant global health issue, with infection rates ranging from 0.3 to 2.9%. It is a widespread infection that affects individuals of all ages but is more prevalent in developing countries. In these areas, diarrhea is the most common clinical presentation, and it has a severe impact on children.

==== Sex ====
Campylobacter is more frequently isolated in males than females, and homosexual men appear to have a higher risk of infection by atypical campylobacter-related species such as &quot;Helicobacter cinaedi&quot; and &quot;Helicobacter fennelliae&quot;.

==== Age ====
Campylobacter infections can occur in all age groups. Studies show a peak incidence in children younger than 1 year and in people aged 15–29 years. The age-specific attack rate is highest in young children. In the United States, the highest incidence of &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infection in 2010 was in children younger than 5 years and was 24.4 cases per 100,000 population. Community based studies done in developing countries show about 60,000 out of every 100,000 children under five years old are affected by campylobacter infections. However, the rate of fecal cultures positive for campylobacter species is greatest in adults and older children.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnostic tests are available to identify campylobacter infections, including those caused by &quot;C. jejuni.&quot; The stool culture is considered the gold standard for diagnosing &quot;C. jejuni,&quot; and selective culture techniques are used to distinguish it from other variants. Stool cultures are grown at 42 degrees Celsius in an atmosphere of 85% N2, 10% CO2, and 5% O2, as &quot;C. jejuni&quot; requires these conditions due to being thermophilic and microaerophilic. A final diagnosis from a stool sample requires a gram stain or phase contrast microscopy.

Aside from stool cultures, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; can be detected using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These methods are more sensitive than stool cultures, but PCR tends to be the most sensitive especially in children and developing countries.

== Treatment ==
&quot;Campylobacter&quot; infections tend to be mild, requiring only hydration and electrolyte repletion while diarrhea lasts. Maintenance of electrolyte balance, not antibiotic treatment, is the cornerstone of treatment for campylobacter enteritis. Depending on the degree of dehydration, alternate measures may be taken including parenteral methods of hydration. Indeed, most patients with this infection have a self-limited illness and do not require antibiotics at all; however, they may be the best form of treatment in more severe cases of infection.

=== Antibiotic treatment ===
Antibiotic treatment for &quot;Campylobacter&quot; infections is usually not required nor recommended. Antibiotics are limited for treating high-risk patients including immunocompromised and older individuals. Severe cases exhibiting symptoms such as bloody stools, fever, severe abdominal pain, pregnancy, infection with HIV, and prolonged illness (symptoms that last &gt; 1 week) may also require treatment by antibiotics which can help to shorten the duration of the symptoms. It is advisable to treat these infections with macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin or azithromycin. Erythromycin is inexpensive and limits toxic exposure to patients, however resistance rates are reportedly increasing; its use is continued however, as resistance rates remain below 5%. Azithromycin usage is increasing due to various drug characteristics, including its once-a-day dosage, tolerability by patients, decreased relation to Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), and less negative symptoms; this is comparative to erythromycin. Fluoroquinolones are another source of treatment, however resistance rates of bacteria to this type of antibiotic is greatly increasing.

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
Fluoroquinolones were first approved as a treatment for campylobacter infections in 1986, and were later U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 1996, so as to control infections in poultry flocks. The CDC began monitoring campylobacter in 1997 in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). Data from NARMS indicated ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, had microbial resistance rates of 17% in 1997–1999, which further increased to 27% in 2015–2017. On September 12, 2005, the FDA suspended the use of all fluoroquinolones in poultry production, and the prevalence of campylobacter strains that are fluoroquinolone resistant in poultry flocks, poultry products, production facilities, and human infections became vital to monitor; this was in an effort to determine if the fluoroquinolone ban led to a reduction in the antibiotic-resistant strains. A presence of drug-resistance to ciprofloxacin has been observed in isolate studies, as well as significant drug-resistance among campylobacter to the antibiotics nalidixic acid and tetracyclines. There is a low rate of resistance to erythromycin, the preferred source of antibiotic treatment for campylobacter infections, however resistant strains have been detected in many countries among sources of the origin of food from farm animals.

== Prevention ==
Some simple food-handling practices can help prevent campylobacter infections.
* Cook all poultry products thoroughly. Make sure that the meat is cooked throughout (no longer pink) and any juices run clear. All poultry should be cooked to reach a minimum internal temperature of .
* Wash hands with soap before preparing food.
* Wash hands with soap after handling raw foods of animal origin and before touching anything else.
* Prevent cross-contamination in the kitchen by using separate cutting boards for foods of animal origin and other foods and by thoroughly cleaning all cutting boards, countertops, and utensils with soap and hot water after preparing raw food of animal origin.
* Do not drink unpasteurized milk or untreated surface water.
* Make sure that people with diarrhea, especially children, wash their hands carefully and frequently with soap to reduce the risk of spreading the infection.
* Wash hands with soap after contact with pet feces.

== Laboratory characteristics ==

Under light microscopy, &quot;C. jejuni&quot; has a characteristic &quot;sea-gull&quot; shape as a consequence of its helical form. Campylobacter is grown on specially selective &quot;CAMP&quot; agar plates at 42 °C, the normal avian body temperature, rather than at 37 °C, the temperature at which most other pathogenic bacteria are grown. Since the colonies are oxidase positive, they usually only grow in scanty amounts on the plates. Microaerophilic conditions are required for luxurious growth. A selective blood agar medium (Skirrow&#x27;s medium) can be used. Greater selectivity can be gained with an infusion of a cocktail of antibiotics: vancomycin, polymixin-B, trimethoprim, and actidione (Preston&#x27;s agar), and growth under microaerophilic conditions at 42 °C.

== Genome ==
The genome of &quot;C. jejuni&quot; strain NCTC11168 was published in 2000, revealing 1,641,481 base pairs (30.6% G+C) predicted to encode 1,654 proteins and 54 stable RNA species. The genome is unusual in that virtually no insertion sequences or phage-associated sequences and very few repeat sequences are found. One of the most striking findings in the genome was the presence of hypervariable sequences. These short homopolymeric runs of nucleotides were commonly found in genes encoding the biosynthesis or modification of surface structures, or in closely linked genes of unknown function. The apparently high rate of variation of these homopolymeric tracts may be important in the survival strategy of &quot;C. jejuni&quot;. The genome was re-annotated in 2007 updating 18.2% of product functions. Analysis also predicted the first pathogenicity island in &quot;C. jejuni&quot; among select strains, harbouring the bacteria&#x27;s Type VI secretion system and putative cognate effectors.

Initial transposon mutagenesis screens revealed 195 essential genes, although this number is likely to go up with additional analysis.

==Natural genetic transformation==
&quot;C. jejuni&quot; is naturally competent for genetic transformation. Natural genetic transformation is a sexual process involving DNA transfer from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium, and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination. &quot;C. jejuni&quot; freely takes up foreign DNA harboring genetic information responsible for antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance genes are more frequently transferred in biofilms than between planktonic cells (single cells that float in liquid media).

<text>The is a creature that appears in &quot;The Gratitude of the Samebito&quot;, a short story by Lafcadio Hearn. It is described as a shark-like humanoid with inky black skin, emerald green eyes, a face like a demon&#x27;s and a beard like a dragon&#x27;s.

==Mythology==
In the story, a man named Tōtarō meets the Samebito one day on a bridge. Although frightening, the creature turns out to be a gentle being who, as punishment for a petty fault, has been expelled from the sea by his former employer Ryūjin. Tōtarō takes pity on the creature and allows it to live in a deep pond in his garden. Meanwhile, Tōtarō has been seeking a bride and eventually falls in love with a beautiful woman he sees at a female pilgrimage at Mii-dera. He becomes deathly sick with grief, however, on learning that her family requires a betrothal gift of ten thousand jewels for her hand in marriage. When the Samebito learns that his master is on his deathbed, he begins to cry tears of blood which become precious rubies when they hit the ground. Through the Samebito&#x27;s tears, Tōtarō eventually wins the hand of the woman with whom he is infatuated. When he has finished weeping, the Samebito is also pardoned by the dragons, and the story ends happily.

Hearn notes that the name for this being is usually read as &quot;Kōjin&quot;. The &quot;kōjin&quot; are creatures thought to live in the South China Sea, which resemble &quot;ningyo&quot;, are always weaving at their looms and whose tears become jewels.

Hearn&#x27;s story appears to have been based on another story called &quot;Kōjin&quot; by Kyokutei Bakin.

<text>In Japanese folklore and Folklore, is the mythical king and god of the &quot;tengu&quot;, legendary creatures thought to inhabit the mountains and forests of Japan. Sōjōbō is a specific type of &quot;tengu&quot; called &quot;daitengu&quot; and has the appearance of a yamabushi, a Japanese mountain hermit. &quot;Daitengu&quot; have a primarily human form with some bird-like features such as wings and claws. The other distinctive physical characteristics of Sōjōbō include his long, white hair and unnaturally long nose.

Sōjōbō is said to live on Mount Kurama. He rules over the other &quot;tengu&quot; that inhabit Mount Kurama in addition to all the other &quot;tengu&quot; in Japan. He is extremely powerful, and one legend says he has the strength of 1,000 normal &quot;tengu&quot;.

Sōjōbō is perhaps best known for the legend of his teaching the warrior Minamoto no Yoshitsune (then known by his childhood name Ushiwaka-maru or Shanao) the arts of swordsmanship, tactics, and magic.

== Etymology ==

Most &quot;tengu&quot; are referred to impersonally. Sōjōbō is an exception and is one of the &quot;tengu&quot; that are given personal names and recognised as individual personalities. The name &quot;Sōjōbō&quot; originated in a text called &quot;Tengu Meigikō&quot;, which dates back to the middle of the Edo period in Japan.

The name &quot;Sōjōbō&quot; originates from &quot;Sōjōgatani&quot;, the valley at Mount Kurama near Kibune Shrine associated with the Shugenja. It is in this valley that Ushiwaka-maru trained with Sōjōbō in legend. &quot;Sōjōgatani&quot; means Bishop&#x27;s valley or Bishop&#x27;s vale. The name of this valley is derived from the ascetic Sōjō Ichiyen.

In Japanese, the name &quot;Sōjōbō&quot; is composed of three kanji: . The first two characters of Sōjōbō&#x27;s name, mean . The final kanji, , also means &quot;Buddhist priest&quot; but is also commonly used to mean &quot;yamabushi&quot;.

The are ascetics from the Shugendō tradition. incorporates elements of many religious traditions, including Buddhism. Both &quot;tengu&quot; and &quot;yamabushi&quot; had a reputation for dwelling in the mountains. Yves Bonnefoy suggests that this contributed to the folk belief that &quot;yamabushi&quot; and &quot;tengu&quot; were identical or at least closely connected.

=== Other names ===
Sōjōbō is also referred to by other names and titles that function as names. Sōjōbō is sometimes called the Kurama tengu. This name references Sōjōbō&#x27;s mountain home, Mount Kurama. Ronald Knutsen refers to Sōjōbō by the title of Tengu-san. Sōjōbō is also named by references to his title as the king of the &quot;tengu&quot;. For example, James de Benneville refers to Sōjōbō using the term goblin-king. Similarly, Catherina Blomberg says that the titles &quot;Dai Tengu (Great Tengu) or Tengu Sama (Lord Tengu)&quot; are used to name Sōjōbō. Sometimes, Sōjōbō is named using both a title and a reference to Mount Kurama. The Noh play &quot;Kurama-Tengu&quot;, for example, features a character named Great Tengu of Mount Kurama.

==Mythology==
Sōjōbō is known for his relationship with the Japanese warrior Minamoto no Yoshitsune in legend. After Yoshitsune&#x27;s father was killed in a battle with the Taira clan, the young Yoshitsune was sent to a temple on Mount Kurama. On Mount Kurama, Yoshitsune met Sōjōbō and was trained by him in martial arts. Yoshitsune became a highly skilled warrior as a result of Sōjōbō&#x27;s training. For example, in the war epic &quot;Heiji monogatari (The Tale of Heiji)&quot; it is said that the training young Yoshitsune received &quot;was the reason why he could run and jump beyond the limits of human power&quot;

=== Portrayal ===

In the tenth and eleventh centuries, de Visser says that &quot;tengu&quot; were thought to be &quot;a mountain demon&quot; that caused trouble in the human world. In stories from this period, &quot;tengu&quot; were portrayed as enemies of Buddhism. Later, &quot;tengu&quot; were no longer seen as enemies of Buddhism specifically, but were portrayed as wanting to &quot;throw the whole word into disorder&quot;. According to de Visser, the reason Sōjōbō trains Yoshitsune in martial arts is to start a war.

In the &quot;Gikeiki&quot;, a text concerning the life of Yoshitsune, &quot;Sōjōgatani&quot; or Bishop&#x27;s valley is described as being the location of a once popular temple that is now deserted except for &quot;tengu&quot;. According to the text, when evening approaches &quot;there is a loud crying of spirits&quot; and whoever visits the valley is seized by the &quot;tengu&quot; and tortured. A similar phenomenon is called &quot;kamikakushi&quot;. &quot;Kamikakushi&quot; involves the kidnapping of human beings by a supernatural entity, such as a &quot;tengu&quot;. It involves the disappearance of a child, usually a boy, followed by their return at a new and strange location and in a seemingly altered state. Cases of &quot;kamikakushi&quot; can be caused by any &quot;yōkai&quot;, but &quot;tengu&quot; are often said to be involved. Michael Foster says that the legend of the young Yoshitsune&#x27;s interaction with the tengu &quot;fits the pattern&quot; of a &quot;kamikakushi&quot; kidnapping
In the fourteenth century, de Visser says, there is a change from all &quot;tengu&quot; being portrayed as bad to distinctions made &quot;between good and bad tengu&quot;. Foster says that in variations of the legend of Sōjōbō and the young Yoshitsune, the &quot;tengu&quot; are portrayed as benevolent and helpful as they attempt to help the young Yoshitsune defeat the clan who killed his father.

Foster quotes dialogue from a work called &quot;Miraiki (Chronicle of the Future)&quot; to demonstrate the idea of the &quot;tengu&quot; being portrayed in a more benevolent way. After the subordinate &quot;tengu&quot; see the young Yoshitsune practising near the temple on Mount Kurama, they explain that their prideful ways prevented them from becoming Buddhas and instead caused them to become &quot;tengu&quot;. Then they say:
The portrayal of the &quot;tengu&quot;, and Sōjōbō specifically, as sympathetic to the young Yoshitsune and his desire to avenge his father, is also shown in the Noh play &quot;Kurama-tengu&quot;. In the play, the Great Tengu represents the figure of Sōjōbō. The Great Tengu says he his impressed with the Ushiwakamaru character, the young Yoshitsune, for his respectfulness and admirable intentions. Not only does he help Ushiwakamaru by training him to become a great warrior and defeat his enemies, he also promises to protect him and support him in future battles.

== Classification ==
Sōjōbō is a &quot;tengu&quot;, which are a type of nonhuman creature in Japanese folklore and mythology with supernatural characteristics and abilities. &quot;Tengu&quot; are also considered well-known example of &quot;yōkai&quot;. &quot;Yōkai&quot; is a term that can describe a range of different supernatural beings. According to Foster, a &quot;yōkai&quot; can be characterised in a number of ways, such as &quot;… a weird or mysterious creature, a monster or fantastic being, a spirit or a sprit&quot;

There are two main sub-categories or types of &quot;tengu&quot;. First, there are &quot;tengu&quot; with the primary form of a bird and second there are &quot;tengu&quot; that have the primary form of a human. &quot;Tengu&quot; of the first sub-category are generally called &quot;kotengu&quot; but can also be called &quot;karasu tengu&quot; or &quot;shōtengu&quot;. The second sub-category of tengu is called &quot;daitengu&quot; or &quot;long-nosed tengu&quot;. As he is described as having a primarily human form, Sōjōbō belongs to the sub-category &quot;daitengu&quot;.

=== &quot;Daitengu&quot; ===
The &quot;daitengu&quot; or long nosed &quot;tengu&quot; represent a later stage in the development of the concept of &quot;tengu&quot; in Japan. According to de Visser, &quot;tengu&quot; were first in the form of a bird, then had a human form with the head of a bird, and finally the bird beak became a long nose. Similarly, Basil Hall Chamberlain says that the beak of the &quot;tengu&quot; &quot;becomes a large and enormously long human nose, and the whole creature is conceived as human&quot;. There is no mention of the &quot;tengu&quot; having long noses in Japanese tales until after the second half of the fourteenth century. While the &quot;kotengu&quot; or bird type of tengu came first, the &quot;daitengu&quot; with the long human nose is more common in modern Japanese culture. Sōjōbō is one of the &quot;eight great dai-tengu&quot; and, of these, one of the three that are most well-known.

== Characteristics ==
=== Physical appearance ===
As a &quot;daitengu&quot;, Sōjōbō has a primarily human form. Frederick Hadland Davis describes Sōjōbō as having both “bird-like claws, and feathered wings” and &quot;a long red nose and enormous glaring eyes&quot;. Similarly, de Visser says Sōjōbō has &quot;sparkling eyes and a big nose&quot;. Sōjōbō is also described as having a long white beard. &quot;Daitengu&quot; are described as being larger in overall size than &quot;kotengu&quot;. For example, in one legend Sōjōbō appears to be a giant from the perspective of a human.

One characteristic that both types of &quot;tengu&quot; share is their style of dress. &quot;Tengu&quot; are depicted wearing religious clothing and accessories, especially the clothing and accessories of the &quot;yamabushi&quot;. As such, Sōjōbō is often described or depicted with these items and wearing these clothes. The dress of the &quot;yamabushi&quot; includes formal robes, square-toed shoes, a sword, a scroll, a fan, and a distinctive headdress. The distinctive headdress worn by &quot;yamabushi&quot; is called a &quot;tokin&quot;. A common style of &quot;tokin&quot;, worn from the start of the Edo period, is a small hat that resembles a black box. Sōjōbō carries a fan made from seven feathers as a sign of his position at the top of &quot;tengu&quot; society. Bonnefoy says that the feather fan carried by &quot;tengu&quot; may signify the original bird-like features of the &quot;tengu&quot; Similarly, Davis says that in the development of the concept of &quot;tengu&quot; from bird-like to more human-like, “nothing bird-like” was left except for &quot;the fan of feathers with which it fans itself&quot;.

=== Supernatural abilities ===
Another characteristic that Sōjōbō shares with &quot;yamabushi&quot; is a reputation for having supernatural abilities. &quot;Yamabushi&quot; often performed various practises in the mountains to try and attain supernatural abilities. According to folk belief, &quot;yamabushi&quot; had the abilities of flight and invisibility &quot;Tengu&quot; were thought to be able to spiritually possess human beings, similar to foxes. Other abilities attributed to &quot;tengu&quot; include invisibility, shapeshifting, flight, and the ability to tell the future. Sōjōbō is portrayed as having a reputation for being more powerful than other &quot;tengu&quot; or being a &quot;match for a thousand&quot;

== Roles ==
=== Mount Kurama chieftain ===
The &quot;daitengu&quot; subcategory of &quot;tengu&quot; is superior to the &quot;kotengu&quot; in rank. Foster says that the different types of &quot;tengu&quot; were often depicted as being in a hierarchical relationship to one another, with the &quot;daitengu&quot; &quot;flanked by a posse&quot; of the &quot;kotengu&quot; who are &quot;portrayed as lieutenants&quot; to the &quot;daitengu&quot;. The higher rank of the daitengu is also shown by the hierarchical structure on the &quot;tengu&quot; mountains.

In general, &quot;tengu&quot; of both types are thought to inhabit mountainous areas in Japan. Some individual &quot;daitengu&quot; are linked with specific mountains in Japan and are considered to be the chieftains of the other &quot;tengu&quot; on that mountain. The mountain that Sōjōbō is said to inhabit is Mount Kurama. According to Knutsen, Mount Kurama is &quot;associated in the popular mind with the tengu&quot;. Mount Kurama is located north of the city of Kyōto in Japan. On Mount Kurama there is a famous shrine and temple called &quot;Kuramadera&quot;, which dates back to 770 AD. The mountain has connections to the history of both reiki and aikido. Mount Kurama is known as a &quot;new-age power spot&quot; in modern times.

Sōjōbō is considered to be the chieftain of Mount Kurama. Blomberg describes Sōjōbō as having &quot;retainers&quot; who &quot;have the form of a karasu tengu&quot;. An example of the hierarchy of the two sub-categories of &quot;tengu&quot; is exhibited in the Noh play &quot;Kurama-Tengu&quot;. In the play, there are &quot;tengu&quot; characters who are described as menial and are given orders by Sōjōbō or the Great Tengu character.

=== King of the &quot;tengu&quot; ===

In addition to role of chieftain of Mount Kurama, Sōjōbō is considered to be the chieftain or king of all the other &quot;tengu&quot; mountains in Japan. Sōjōbō&#x27;s role as king of the &quot;tengu&quot; is demonstrated in the Noh play &quot;Kurama-Tengu&quot;. In the play, the Great Tengu lists his large number of &quot;tengu&quot; servants, which are not just &quot;tengu&quot; from Mount Kurama but &quot;tengu&quot; from other areas as well. This demonstrates his authority over both the &quot;tengu&quot; on Mount Kurama and all the other &quot;tengu&quot; in Japan. This authority is also shown in a story called &quot;The Palace of the Tengu&quot;. In the story, the figure of Sōjōbō is called Great Tengu. He orders one of his &quot;tengu&quot; servants to send a message to summon the &quot;tengu&quot; chieftains of other mountains on his behalf. These &quot;tengu&quot; chieftains include &quot;Tarōbō of Mount Atago, Jirōbō of Mount Hira, Saburōbō of Mount Kōya, Shirōbo of Mount Nachi, and Buzenbō of Mount Kannokura&quot;.

Sōjōbō is specifically associated with a place on Mount Kurama called &quot;Sōjōgatani&quot; or Bishop&#x27;s valley. According to de Benneville, this area was thought to be &quot;the haunt of tengu, even … the seat of the court of their goblin-king&quot;. Similarly, de Visser says that some &quot;tengu&quot; live in “brilliant palaces” and Sōjōbō or the &quot;Great Tengu&quot; was &quot;the Lord of such a palace&quot;. Sōjōbō&#x27;s &quot;tengu&quot; palace features in the story &quot;The Palace of the Tengu&quot;. A character in this story, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, reaches the &quot;tengu&quot; palace by starting at the bottom of the slope of the temple on Mount Kurama, climbing a path up the mountainside until he reaches coloured walls that lead him to the gates of the palace. He finds the palace to be very large, elaborate, and decorated with different jewels. According to the story, the palace contains &quot;hundreds of tengu&quot;.

== Appearances ==


=== In performing arts ===

The Noh play &quot;Kurama-Tengu&quot; features an interpretation of the legend about Sōjōbō and Yoshitsune. is a genre of traditional Japanese theatre. Shinko Kagaya and Hiroko Miura say Noh is comparable to opera because of its focus on dance and music.

In &quot;Kurama-Tengu&quot;, Sōjōbō is initially disguised as a mountain priest and befriends the young Yoshitsune (called Ushiwakamaru at this age) at a celebration of the cherry blossoms on Mount Kurama. Then the following exchange between the two characters occurs:
After his true identity is revealed, the Great Tengu says he will “hand down the secret of the art of war” to Ushiwakamaru. The Great Tengu instructs the menial &quot;tengu&quot; to practice with Ushiwakamaru. Ushiwakamaru then becomes extremely skilled, as demonstrated by the words of the reciters who say that &quot;even the monsters in the heavens and the demons in the underworld will be unable to beat his elegance with braveness&quot;. The play ends with the Great Tengu predicting that Ushiwakamaru will defeat his enemies and avenge his father. He then promises to protect Ushiwakamaru before disappearing into the trees of Mount Kurama.

The legend of Yoshitsune learning martial arts from the &quot;tengu&quot; is also featured in another genre of Japanese drama called &quot;kōwakamai&quot;. The main element of &quot;kōwakamai&quot; is performance, but the texts associated with the performances are also significant to the genre. The &quot;kōwakamai&quot; work featuring the legend is called &quot;Miraiki (Chronicle of the Future)&quot;. This work has a similar plot to the literary work &quot;Tengu no dairi (The Palace of the Tengu)&quot;.

=== In literary arts ===

An example from the literary arts of the legend of Sōjōbō and Yoshitsune is the &quot;otogi-zōshi&quot; story called &quot;Tengu no dairi (The Palace of the Tengu)&quot;. &quot;Otogi-zōshi&quot; is a genre of Japanese fiction that was prominent in the fourteenth century and up to seventeenth century. Sōjōbō also independently features in an &quot;otogi-zōshi&quot; story called &quot;The Tale of the Handcart Priest&quot;.

In &quot;Tengu no dairi (The Palace of the Tengu)&quot;, a young Yoshitsune seeks out and visits the palace of the &quot;tengu&quot;. He meets the Great Tengu and his wife, who tell him that his father &quot;has been reborn as Dainichi Buddha in the Pure Land of Amida&quot;. The story then covers the supernatural journey of the Great Tengu and the young Yoshitsune through the &quot;six planes of karmic transmigration&quot; to visit Yoshitsune&#x27;s father in the Pure Land.

Sōjōbō is not the protagonist of the story &quot;The Tale of the Handcart Priest&quot; but is mentioned when a group of &quot;tengu&quot; notice his absence from their gathering. They were gathering to conspire against the character the Handcart Priest and were in need of Sōjōbō&#x27;s help. A messenger is sent to Sōjōbō to ask for his help, and he tells the messenger that he doesn&#x27;t want to take part because he has been nearly fatally wounded by the Handcart Priest and &quot;may not survive&quot;. The other &quot;tengu&quot; say that they will never succeed without the aid of Sōjōbō and that the Handcart Priest must be remarkable if he was able to wound &quot;the likes of our Sōjōbō&quot;.

=== In visual arts ===
The legendary relationship between Sōjōbō as instructor and the young Yoshitsune as student serves as the basis of many Japanese woodblock prints. Many of these works were created by artists known for their work in the ukiyo-e genre. Some of these artists include Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, Utagawa Hiroshige, Kawanabe Kyōsai, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, Utagawa Kunisada, and Keisai Eisen.

== Related figures ==

Related figures to Sōjōbō include the other two famous &quot;tengu&quot;, Zegaibō of China and Tarōbō of Mount Atago. Like Sōjōbō, these tengu are &quot;daitengu&quot;, chieftains of a &quot;tengu&quot; mountain, and appear in different forms of Japanese art. Kimbrough says that in one version of the &quot;Heike monogatari&quot;, the &quot;tengu&quot; Tarōbō is described as the greatest &quot;tengu&quot; in Japan. In the text &quot;Gempei Seisuiki&quot;, Tarōbō is described as the &quot;first&quot; of the great &quot;tengu&quot;.

Sōjōbō is also depicted with a similar appearance to other types of supernatural entities. After looking at a drawing of Yoshitsune with a long-nosed &quot;tengu&quot;, Osman Edwards says that the &quot;tengu&quot; &quot;has many characteristics in common with the Scandinavian &quot;trold&quot;&quot;. In Scandinavian folklore, the troll is a legendary monster that, like the &quot;tengu&quot;, dwells in mountains and forests. Secondly, Sōjōbō and &quot;daitengu&quot; in general are depicted in a similar way to a kami or Shinto deity called Sarutahiko. Ashkenazi says descriptions of Sarutahiko present him as being very tall, having an extremely long nose, and with &quot;mirror-like eyes&quot; that &quot;shone cherry-red from inner flames&quot;.

== Modern legacy ==
One modern legacy of Sōjōbō is his representation in Japanese festivals. According to F. Brinkley, entities from the &quot;region of allegory&quot; are honoured at these festivals alongside deities. At some festivals, decorated shrines devoted to a particular deity or subject are mounted on a wooden cart called a &quot;dashi&quot; and are carried down the streets in a procession as part of the festival&#x27;s celebrations. At the festival of Sanno in Tokyo, there is a &quot;dashi&quot; dedicated to Ushiwaka and Sōjōbō. Brinkley says that it was common for the people attending to festival to know the history surrounding each &quot;dashi&quot; and its subject.

The influence of Sōjōbō is also present in popular culture. &quot;Tengu&quot; have become a common subject in different forms Japanese media including film, video games, manga, and anime. One early example is the novel series &quot;Kurama Tengu&quot; authored by Jiro Osaragi, a series of stories about a covert warrior who assumes the titular title as his vigilante persona.

<text>The Aikido Yoshokai Association of North America - AYANA (合氣道耀尚會) is an aikido organization founded in 1991 by former Yoshinkan-affiliated master Takashi Kushida. Its hombu dojo is the Genyokan (玄耀館) Dojo in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

==Style==
Yoshokai Aikido is a &quot;hard&quot; style of aikido by common parlance, and very similar to Yoshinkan.
Full tenkan movements are present, but partial pivots and more conservative blending motions are perhaps more usual. Atemi is common. Yoshokai ukemi is also distinct (similar to Yoshinkan ukemi), with more slapping of the spare hand/foot, and a more forward-feeling &#x27;high fall&#x27; (called &#x27;jumping breakfall&#x27; or &#x27;hiyaku ukemi&#x27;) than the other sideways motions employed in different aikido styles. A special emphasis is placed on aikido as a form of conflict resolution and a cooperative study of making harmony between two people. Like Yoshinkan Aikido, Daito-ryu aiki-jujutsu names for basic techniques are retained (e.g. &quot;ikkajō&quot; rather than &quot;ikkyō&quot;)

Yoshokai Aikido is organized in a rather centralized fashion relative to other styles, with technique lists and explanations distributed annually. This goes hand in hand with its emphasis on meticulous attention to detail.

Yoshokai Aikido closely links techniques, basic movements, and weapons techniques. Weapons techniques (buki-waza) are prominent in the curriculum, mostly with bokken, jō, and tantō.

<text>is a spirit or yōkai in Japanese folklore that is often depicted in Japanese literature, films, or animation.

She may also go by such names as &quot;yuki-musume&quot; (雪娘, &quot;snow daughter&quot;), &quot;yukihime&quot; (雪姫, &quot;snow princess&quot;), &quot;yuki-onago&quot; (雪女子, &quot;snow girl&quot;), &quot;yukijorō&quot; (雪女郎, &quot;snow woman&quot;), &quot;yuki anesa&quot; (雪姉さ, &quot;snow sis&quot;), &quot;yuki-onba&quot; (雪乳母, &quot;snow granny&quot; or &quot;snow nanny&quot;), &quot;yukinba&quot; (雪婆, &quot;snow hag&quot;) in Ehime, &quot;yukifuri-baba&quot; (雪降り婆, &quot;snowfall witch&quot; or &quot;snowfall hag&quot;) in Nagano. They are also called several names that are related to icicles, such as &quot;tsurara-onna&quot;, &quot;kanekori-musume&quot;, and &quot;shigama-nyōbō&quot;.

== Origins ==

Yuki-onna originates from folklores of olden times; in the Muromachi period &quot;Sōgi Shokoku Monogatari&quot; by the renga poet Sōgi, there is a statement on how he saw a yuki-onna when he was staying in Echigo Province (now Niigata Prefecture), indicating that the legends already existed in the Muromachi period.

== Stories ==

In legends from the Ojiya region of Niigata Prefecture, a beautiful woman came to visit a man and became his wife from the woman&#x27;s own desire. This woman was reluctant to go into the bath and when she was made to go in anyway, she disappeared, leaving only thin, fragmented, floating icicles (see also tsurara-onna).

In the Aomori and Yamagata Prefectures, there is a similar story about one called the &quot;Shigama-onna.&quot; In the Kaminoyama region of Yamagata, a yuki-onna would come visit an old couple on a snowy night to warm herself by the irori. When late at night the Yuki-onna would again go out on a journey, the old man would attempt to take her hand to stop her, when he noticed that she was chillingly cold. Then, before his eyes, the girl turned into a whirl of snow that exited the house through the chimney. Also, it has some points of similarity with the &quot;kokakuchō&quot;; and on the night of a blizzard, as the Yuki-onna would be standing there hugging a child (&quot;yukinko&quot;), it would ask people passing by to hug the child as well. When one hugs the child, the child would become heavier and heavier until one would become covered with snow and freeze to death. It has also been told that if one refuses, one would be shoved down into a snowy valley.

In Hirosaki in Aomori, it is said that there was a warrior (bushi) who was asked by a yuki-onna to hug a child similarly, but the warrior held a short sword (&quot;tantō&quot;) by the mouth and hugged the child while making the blade go close to the child&#x27;s head, which allowed the warrior to avoid the aforementioned phenomenon. When the warrior handed the child back to the Yuki-onna, the ghoul gave many treasures as thanks for hugging the child. It is also said that those who are able to withstand the ever-increasing weight of the yukinko and last all the way through would acquire great physical strength.

In the Ina region of Nagano Prefecture, Yuki-onna is called &quot;yukionba&quot;, and it is believed that they would appear on a snowy night in the form of a &quot;yama-uba&quot;. Similarly, in Yoshida, Ehime Prefecture, on a night when snow is accumulating on the ground, a &quot;yukinba&quot; is said to appear, and people would make sure not to let their children outside. Also, in the Tōno region of Iwate Prefecture, and on Little New Year (&quot;koshōgatsu&quot;) or the 15th day of the first month, a yuki-onna would take many children along to a field to play, so children were warned against going outside. It can be thus seen that yuki-onna are often considered the same as the &quot;yama-uba&quot;, sharing the similarity that they are fecund and take many children along with them.

In the Ito region of Wakayama Prefecture, it is said that there would be a one-legged child jump-walking on a night when snow accumulates, and the next morning there would be round footprints remaining, and this would be called the &quot;yukinbō&quot; (snow child), but the one-legged snow kid is thought to be the servant of a mountain god.

In the village of Oshika, Tōhaku District, Tottori Prefecture (now Misasa), it has been said that a yuki-onna would come during light snow and say &quot;Koori gose yu gose&quot; (&quot;Give me ice, give me hot water&quot;)—&quot;gose&quot; is a dialect word for &quot;give me&quot;—while waving around a white wand, and she would bulge when splashed with water and disappear when splashed with hot water.

In the area around the Kumano River in Yoshino District, Nara Prefecture, the &quot;Oshiroi baa-san&quot; or &quot;oshiroi babaa&quot; is also thought to be a type of Yuki-onna, and they are said to drag along mirrors, making clinking sounds while doing so. These characteristics, that of waving around a white wand (&quot;gohei&quot;) and possessing a mirror, are thought to be the characteristics of a &quot;miko&quot; who serves a mountain god that rules over birth and harvest.

In Aomori, it is said that a yuki-onna would come down to the village on the third day of Shōgatsu and return to the mountains on the first day of Rabbit, and it is thought that on years when the day of Rabbit is late in arriving, how well the harvest does will be different from before.

In the Iwate and the Miyagi Prefectures, a yuki-onna is thought to steal people&#x27;s vitality; and in Niigata Prefecture, they are said to take the livers out of children and freeze people to death. In Nishimonai, Akita Prefecture, looking at a yuki-onna&#x27;s face and exchanging words with her would result in being eaten. In Ibaraki Prefecture and in Iwaki Province, Fukushima Prefecture, it is said that if one does not answer when called by a yuki-onna, one would be shoved down into the bottom of a valley. In the Fukui Prefecture, they are called &quot;koshi-musume&quot; (越娘, &quot;passing girl&quot;) and it is said that those who turn their backs to a koshi-musume when being called by one would get pushed into a valley.

In Ibigawa, Ibi District, Gifu Prefecture, an invisible monster called the &quot;yukinobō&quot; is said to change its appearance and appear as a yuki-onna. It is said that this monster would appear at mountain huts and ask for water, but if one grants the request, one would be killed, so one should give hot tea instead. It is said that in order to make the yukinbō go away, one should chant &quot;Saki kuromoji ni ato bōshi, shimetsuke haitara, ikanaru mono mo, kanō mai&quot; (meaning &quot;A &quot;kurujo&quot; in front and a &quot;bōshi&quot; behind, by wearing these tight, nothing is possible&quot;).

The Hirosaki, Aomori legend about a yuki-onna returning to the human world on New Year&#x27;s Day (Shōgatsu) and the legend in Tōno, Iwate Prefecture about yuki-onna taking away many children to play on &quot;Little New Year&quot; (koshōgatsu)- looking at the days on which they visit, both legends offer insight on how the yuki-onna has some characteristics of a toshigami. The story of how when one person treated a yuki-onna with kindness on a blizzard night, the yuki-onna turned into gold the next morning; illustrating how even in old tales such as the Ōtoshi no Kyaku, the yuki-onna has some relation to the characteristics of a toshigami.

Yuki-onna often appear while taking along children. This is in common with another yōkai that takes along children, the ubume. In the Mogami District, Yamagata Prefecture, ubume are said to be yuki-onna.

They often appear in stories about inter-species marriage, and stories similar to Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s &quot;Yuki-onna&quot; where a mountain hunter gets together with a woman who stays the night as a guest and eventually births a child. One day the man carelessly talks about the taboo of getting together with a yuki-onna, resulting in the woman revealing herself to be a yuki-onna, but not killing the man due to having a child between them and warning, &quot;If anything happens to the child, you won&#x27;t get away with it&quot; before going away. These stories can be found in Niigata Prefecture, Toyama Prefecture, and the Nagano Prefecture, which came about as a result of many stories about mountain people where those who break the mountain taboos would be killed by mountain spirits. There is also the hypothesis that the yuki-onna legend was born from a mixture of paranormal stories of mountain people and the paranormal yuki-onna stories.

Old tales about yuki-onna are mostly stories of sorrow, and it is said that these tales started from when people who have lived gloomy lives, such as childless old couples or single men in mountain villages, would hear the sound of a blizzard knocking on their shutter door and fantasize that the thing that they longed for has come. It is said that after that, they would live in happiness with what they longed for in a fantasy as fleeting as snow. There is also a feeling of fear, and like as in the &quot;Tōno Monogatari&quot;, the sound of a blizzard knocking on an outer shōji is called the &quot;shōji sasuri&quot; (rubbing a shōji), and there is a custom of making children who stayed up late go to sleep quickly when a yuki-onna rubs a shōji. From real sayings such as the shōji sasuri, it is said that things that one longs for sit back-to-back with fear. Also, winter is the season when gods would come to visit, and if one does not pay respects, terrible things will happen, so even if it is said to be things that one longs for, one cannot put too much trust in that. In any case, it can be said to be related to the coming and going of seasons. Nobuyoshi Furuhashi, scholar of Japanese literature, stated that the novel Kaze no Matasaburō is also probably somehow related.

There are various legends about the yuki-onna&#x27;s true identity, such as a snow spirit or the spirit of a woman who fell over in the snow. In a setsuwa of the Oguni region of Yamagata Prefecture, a yuki-jorō (yuki-onna) was originally a princess of the Moon world, and in order to leave a boring lifestyle came down to Earth together with snow but was unable to go back to the Moon and so appears on snowy moonlit nights.

Yamaoka Genrin, an intellectual from the Edo period, said that yuki-onna is born from snow. It was supposed that if there were a lot of something, a living thing would come forth from it, giving birth to fish if the water is deep enough and birds if the forest is thick enough. Since both snow and women are &quot;yin&quot;, so in places like Echigo it is said that yuki-onna might be born from within deep snow.

Among Japan&#x27;s traditional culture, Yuki-onna can be seen in kōwaka such as the Fushimi Tokiwa (伏見常磐), which can also be checked in modern times. In Chikamatsu Monzaemon&#x27;s Yuki-onna Gomai Hagoita, the story is about how a woman who was deceived and murdered became a yuki-onna and took revenge as a vengeful ghost. The bewitching and frightening aspects of a yuki-onna are often used in such depictions. Old tales and legends like these have been confirmed in Aomori, Yamagata, Iwate, Fukushima, Niigata, Nagano, Wakayama, Ehime, among other places.

== Appearance ==

Yuki-onna appears on snowy nights as a tall, beautiful woman with long black hair and blue lips. Her inhumanly pale or even transparent skin makes her blend into the snowy landscape (as famously described in Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s &quot;&quot;). She often wears a white kimono, but other legends describe her as nude, with only her face and hair standing out against the snow. Despite her inhuman beauty, her eyes can strike terror into mortals. She floats across the snow, leaving no footprints (in fact, some tales say she has no feet, a feature of many Japanese ghosts), and she can transform into a cloud of mist or snow if threatened.

== Variations ==
There are several variations of Yuki-onna throughout Japan, through which one can fill a whole book only about this yokai. Some notable of them are described below:
*Water Beggars: This variation hails from Tottori Prefecture, where it is said that Yuki-onna travels on wind and appears on the days with a light snowfall. She walks swinging a white Gohei wand and shouts whoever she meets saying, &quot;Please give me water-hot or cold.&quot; If anyone gives cold water, she swells in size but if anyone gives hot water she melts and disappears.
*The Moon Princess: This variations hails from Yamagata Prefecture where it is said that Yuki-onna is the princess of lunar world, living on the moon. Her life was filled with luxury, but it was extremely boring for her. She was fascinated to see the planet Earth below. So, she snuck out one night and fell down to Earth, travelling on snow. However, coming to Earth was easier for her than going back, and she got stuck on Earth. She used to appear on full moon snowy night, pining for her old home.
*The Snow Vampire: This version of Yuki-onna hails from four Japanese provinces; Aomori, Gunma, Niigata, and Miyagi. Here it is said that Yuki-onna is a dreadful snow vampire, haunting the snowy forests, looking to feed. She lives by sucking the vital energy of human body, which is mentioned as &quot;seiki&quot;. She is said to extract the &quot;seiki&quot; first by freezing victims to death and then sucking the &quot;seiki&quot; through the dead victim&#x27;s mouth. Especially in Niigata prefecture, it is said that Yuki-onna likes the &quot;seiki&quot; of children, so the mothers are warned over there not to let their children play on snowy nights near a forest.
*The Talking Snow Women: This version hails from Ibaraki, Fukushima, Akita &amp; Fukui prefectures. Here, the Yuki-onna engages her victims in conversation in order to attack. When she meets someone on a dark and snowy night, she calls out to them. If the person answers her greeting, she attacks. But in Fukushima and Ibaraki, it is said that Yuki-onna attacks those who ignore her, whom she grabs and throws into a nearby ravine.

== Behavior ==
Some legends say the Yuki-onna, being associated with winter and snowstorms, is the spirit of someone who perished in the snow. She is at the same time beautiful and serene, yet ruthless in killing unsuspecting mortals. Until the 18th century, she was almost uniformly portrayed as evil. Today, however, stories often color her as mere human, emphasizing her ghost-like nature and ephemeral beauty.

In many stories, Yuki-onna appears to travelers trapped in snowstorms and uses her icy breath to leave them as frost-coated corpses. Other legends say she leads them astray so they simply die of exposure. Other times, she manifests holding a child. When a well-intentioned soul takes the &quot;child&quot; from her, they are frozen in place. Parents searching for lost children are particularly susceptible to this tactic. Other legends make Yuki-onna much more aggressive. In these stories, she often invades homes, blowing in the door with a gust of wind to kill residents in their sleep (some legends require her to be invited inside first).

What Yuki-onna is after varies from tale to tale. Sometimes she is simply satisfied to see a victim die. Other times, she is more vampiric, draining her victims&#x27; blood or &quot;life force.&quot; She occasionally takes on a succubus-like manner, preying on weak-willed men to drain or freeze them through sex or a kiss.

Like the snow and winter weather she represents, Yuki-onna has a softer side. She sometimes lets would-be victims go for various reasons. In one popular Yuki-onna legend, for example, she sets a young boy free because of his beauty and age. She makes him promise never to speak of her, but later in life, he tells the story to his wife who reveals herself to be Yuki-Onna. She reviles him for breaking his promise but spares him again, this time out of concern for their children (but if he dares mistreat their children, she will return with no mercy. Luckily for him, he is a loving father). In some versions, she chose not to kill him because he told her, which she did not treat as a broken promise (technically, Yuki-Onna herself is not a human and thus did not count). In a similar legend, Yuki-onna melts away once her husband discovers her true nature. However, she departs to the afterlife afterward the same way. In the same version of the story, the Yuki-Onna is seen with a stutter saying &quot;It was I-I-I! Yuki it was!&quot;. In some versions, Yuki-onna doesn&#x27;t leave and that she actually stays with her husband and their children, since it doesn&#x27;t count as telling anyone else.

=== Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s version ===
A long time ago, there lived two woodcutters, Minokichi and Mosaku. Minokichi was young and Mosaku was very old.

One winter day, they could not come back home because of a snowstorm. They found a hut in the mountain and decided to sleep there. On this particular evening, Minokichi woke up and found a beautiful lady with white clothes. She breathed on old Mosaku and he was frozen to death.

She then approached Minokichi to breathe on him, but stared at him for a while and said, &quot;I thought I was going to kill you, the same as that old man, but I will not because you are young and beautiful. You must not tell anyone about this incident. If you tell anyone about me, I will kill you.&quot;

Several years later, Minokichi met a beautiful young lady, named O-yuki (Yuki = &quot;snow&quot;) and married her. She was a good wife. Minokichi and O-yuki had several children and lived happily for many years. Mysteriously, she did not age.

One night, after the children were asleep, Minokichi said to O-yuki: &quot;Whenever I see you, I am reminded of a mysterious incident that happened to me. When I was young, I met a beautiful young lady like you. I do not know if it was a dream or if she was a Yuki-onna...&quot;

After finishing his story, O-yuki suddenly stood up and said &quot;That woman you met was me! I told you that I would kill you if you ever told anyone about that incident. However, I can&#x27;t kill you because of our children. Take care of our children...&quot; Then she melted and disappeared. No one saw her again.

<text>Lin Zexu (30 August 1785 – 22 November 1850), courtesy name Yuanfu, was a Chinese political philosopher and politician. He was a head of state (Viceroy), Governor General, scholar-official, and under the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing dynasty best known for his role in the First Opium War of 1839–42. He was from Fuzhou, Fujian Province. Lin&#x27;s forceful opposition to the opium trade was a primary catalyst for the First Opium War. He is praised for his constant position on the &quot;moral high ground&quot; in his fight, but he is also blamed for a rigid approach which failed to account for the domestic and international complexities of the problem. The Emperor endorsed the hardline policies and anti-drugs movement advocated by Lin, but placed all responsibility for the resulting disastrous Opium War onto Lin. However, Lin&#x27;s efforts against the opium trade was appreciated by drug prohibition activists and revered as a culture hero in Chinese culture, symbolizes drug abuse resistance in China. 

==Early life and career==

Lin was born in Houguan (侯官; modern Fuzhou, Fujian Province) towards the end of the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign. His father, Lin Binri (), served as an official under the Qing government. He was the second son in the family. As a child, he was already &quot;unusually brilliant&quot;. In 1811, he obtained the position of advanced &quot;Jinshi&quot; () in the imperial examination, and in the same year he gained admission to the Hanlin Academy. Lin&#x27;s scholarly excellence earned him widespread recognition, elevating his career prospects. He rose rapidly through various grades of provincial service. He opposed the opening of China but felt the need of a better knowledge of foreigners, which drove him to collect material for a geography of the world. His interest in Western knowledge reflected his pragmatic views, acknowledging foreign influence while resisting Western domination. He later gave this material to Wei Yuan, who published the &quot;Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms&quot; in 1843. He became Governor-General of Hunan and Hubei in 1837, where he launched a suppression campaign against the trading of opium. Lin’s role as Governor-General was pivotal in leading China’s anti-opium efforts, reflecting his strong moral stance against the drug trade.

==Campaign to suppress opium==
Soon after his arrival in Guangdong in the middle of 1839, Lin wrote a memorial to the &quot;Ruler of England&quot; in the form of an open letter published in Canton, urging England to end the opium trade. He argued that China was providing Britain with valuable commodities such as tea, porcelain, spices and silk, with Britain sending only &quot;poison&quot; in return. He accused the foreigner traders of coveting profit and lacking morality. His memorial expressed a desire that the ruler would act &quot;in accordance with decent feeling&quot; and support his efforts. Since he believed that opium was banned in the United Kingdom, he thought it was wrong for Queen Victoria to support it in China. He wrote:

The letter elicited no response (sources suggest that it was lost in transit), but it was later reprinted in the London Times as a direct appeal to the British public.

An edict from the Daoguang Emperor followed on 18March, emphasising the serious penalties for opium smuggling that would now apply.

In March 1839, Lin started to take measures that would eliminate the opium trade. He was a formidable bureaucrat known for his competence and high moral standards, with an imperial commission from the Daoguang Emperor to halt the illegal importation of opium by the British. He made changes within a matter of months. He arrested more than 1,700 Chinese opium dealers and confiscated over 70,000 opium pipes. He initially attempted to get foreign companies to forfeit their opium stores in exchange for tea, but this ultimately failed. Lin resorted to using force in the western merchants&#x27; enclave. A month and a half later, the merchants gave up nearly 1.2 million kg (2.6 million pounds) of opium. Beginning 3 June 1839, 500 workers laboured for 23 days to destroy it, mixing the opium with lime and salt and throwing it into the sea outside of Humen Town. Lin composed an elegy apologising to the gods of the sea for polluting their realm.

Lin and the Daoguang Emperor, comments historian Jonathan Spence, &quot;seemed to have believed that the citizens of Canton and the foreign traders there had simple, childlike natures that would respond to firm guidance and statements of moral principles set out in simple, clear terms.&quot; Neither Lin nor the emperor appreciated the depth or changed nature of the problem. They did not see the change in international trade structures, the commitment of the British government to protecting the interests of private traders, and the peril to British traders who would surrender their opium.

Open hostilities between China and Britain started in 1839 in what later would be called the &quot;First Opium War&quot;. The immediate effect was that both sides, by the words of Charles Elliot and Lin, banned all trade. Before this, Lin had pressured the Portuguese government of Macau, so the British found themselves without refuge, except for the bare and rocky harbours of Hong Kong. Soon, however, the Chinese forces faced a British naval fleet, which included the East India Company&#x27;s steam warship &quot;Nemesis&quot; and improved weapons, and were soon routed.

==Exile in Xinjiang==
Lin made significant preparations for war against the possible British invasion. The British sailed north to attack Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The governors of these two provinces failed to heed a warning from Lin, however, and were unprepared when the British easily landed and occupied Dinghai.

This unpreparedness was partly due to the Qing dynasty&#x27;s ongoing issues with corruption and inefficiency within the local governments. These problems hindered their ability to respond effectively to Lin&#x27;s warnings.

Lin became a scapegoat for these losses due to court politics. As punishment, he was exiled to the remote Ili region in Xinjiang. His position was then given to Qishan in September 1840.

While in Xinjiang, Lin was the first Chinese scholar to record several aspects of Muslim culture there. In 1850, he noted in a poem that the Muslims in Ili did not worship idols but bowed and prayed to tombs decorated with poles that had the tails of cows and horses attached to them. This was the widespread shamanic practice of erecting a &quot;tugh&quot;, but this was its first recorded appearance in Chinese writings. He also recorded several Kazakh oral tales, such as one concerning a green goat spirit of the lake whose appearance is a harbinger of hail or rain.

Lin’s documentation of these practices contributed to a broader understanding of ethnic minorities in China, showcasing the diversity of cultural practices within the empire at the time

The Qing government ultimately rehabilitated Lin. In 1845, he was appointed Governor-General of Shaan-Gan (Shaanxi-Gansu). In 1847, he became governor-General of Yun-Gui (Yunnan-Guizhou). While these posts were considered less prestigious, Lin continued to advocate for reform in opium policy and addressed issues of local governance and corruption. His efforts remained influential, albeit limited, in shaping Qing policy. These posts were less prestigious than his previous position in Canton, thus his career never fully recovered from the failures there.

==Death and legacy==

Lin died in 1850 while on the way to Guangxi Province, where the Qing government was sending him to help put down the Taiping Rebellion. Though he was originally blamed for causing the First Opium War, Lin&#x27;s reputation was rehabilitated in the last years of the Qing dynasty, as efforts were made once more to eradicate opium production and trade. He became a symbol of the fight against opium and other drug trades, with his image displayed in parades, and his writings quoted approvingly by anti-opium and anti-drugs reformers.

Despite the antagonism between the Chinese and the British at the time, the English sinologist Herbert Giles praised and admired Lin: &quot;He was a fine scholar, a just and merciful official and a true patriot.&quot;

Lin&#x27;s former home, situated in Fuzhou&#x27;s historic Sanfang-Qixiang (&quot;Three Lanes and Seven Alleys&quot;) district, is open to the public. Inside, his work as a government official, including the opium trade and other work where he improved agricultural methods, championed water conservation (including his work to save Fuzhou&#x27;s West Lake from becoming a rice field) and his campaign against corruption are well documented.

In China, Lin is popularly viewed as a national hero and culture hero against drug abuse. June 3—the day when Lin confiscated the chests of opium—is unofficially celebrated as Opium Suppression Movement Day in Taiwan, whereas June 26 is recognized as the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in honour of Lin&#x27;s work.
Monuments to Lin have been constructed in Chinese communities around the world. A statue of Lin stands in Chatham Square in Chinatown, New York City, United States. The base of the statue is inscribed with &quot;Pioneer in the war against drugs&quot; in English and Chinese. A wax statue of Lin also appeared in Madame Tussauds wax museum in London.

More recently, Lin has appeared as a character in &quot;River of Smoke&quot;, the second novel in the Ibis trilogy by Amitav Ghosh, which takes the Opium Wars as its setting to shed new light on a much-repressed history while offering a contemporary critique of globalisation. The novel takes place in 1838–1839, during which time Lin arrived in Canton and tensions escalated between the foreigners and the Chinese officials.

He was also depicted in film, such as in the 1997 movie &quot;The Opium War&quot;.

His grandson Commodore Lin Taizeng was an officer in the Beiyang Fleet and commanded one of China&#x27;s two modern battleships purchased from Germany in the 1880s, &quot;Zhenyuan&quot;, during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895). He committed suicide with an opium overdose after the ship ran aground and had to be abandoned. 

Lin descendants are living in Fuzhou, Fujian and surroundings, Jieyang (Puning), Meizhou, Guangdong and surroundings, various places in China and United States.

Lin is remembered for a couplet he wrote while serving as an imperial envoy in Guangdong:
In particular, the first half of the couplet was chosen as the motto for Chinese Wikipedia.

<doc id="571834" wikidata="Q7551234" url="?curid=571834" title="Social mania">
<text>Social manias are mass movements which periodically sweep through societies. They are characterized by an outpouring of enthusiasm, mass involvement and millenarian goals. They are contagious social epidemics, and as such they should be differentiated from mania in individuals.

Social manias come in different sizes and strengths. Some fail to &#x27;catch fire&#x27;, while others persist for centuries (although sometimes in severely attenuated form). Common to all is a vision of salvation, a new way of life, which if realized would radically change everyday life, ushering in a new world of freedom and justice.

==Examples==
The Taiping Rebellion is an excellent illustration, as it was both widespread and destructive and has no modern adherents to whom its use as an example would be a distraction. The Ghost dance which was briefly embraced by Native Americans of the Great Plains in 1890 is another excellent example which may be viewed in some historical perspective, as may The Crusades. Almost any form of religion could be argued to be a long-standing social mania, many of which have persisted through thousands of years.

<text>Absolute Radio is a British digital radio station owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Absolute Radio Network. It broadcasts nationally across the UK via digital audio broadcasting.

The station focuses on alternative and indie music.

== History ==
=== 1993–1997: Virgin Radio launch and early years ===

The Broadcasting Act 1990 allowed for the launch of independent national radio (INR) stations in the United Kingdom. The Radio Authority was mandated to award three INR licences, one of which (INR1) had to be for a &quot;non-pop&quot; station (which was awarded to Classic FM), and one of which had to be for a predominantly speech-based service (this would be advertised later as INR3 and awarded to Talk Radio). The remaining licence was to be open to &quot;all-comers&quot;. The licences were to be awarded to the highest cash bidder, providing that the applicant met criteria set down in the Broadcasting Act.

The second national licence, INR2, would take over the 1197 kHz and 1215 kHz medium wave (AM) frequencies, which were to be relinquished by BBC Radio 3. The licence was advertised in October 1991 and five organisations bid: the Independent National Broadcasting Company of Sheffield, which bid £4,010,000 per year; a TV-am/Virgin consortium (£1,883,000); Chiltern Radio Network&#x27;s 20/20 Radio (£1,311,000); Radio Clyde&#x27;s Score Radio (£701,000); and a consortium of CLT, Harvey Goldsmith and RTÉ (£211,000). The TV-am/Virgin consortium was awarded the licence in April 1992, after the Radio Authority said that it was not satisfied that Independent National Broadcasting would be able to sustain the service. Later that year, TV-am lost its ITV franchise and its stake in the radio station was sold in March 1993 to Apax Partners, JP Morgan Investment Corporation and Sir David Frost.

The station launched as Virgin 1215 at 12:15 pm on 30 April 1993. The original line-up of DJs included Richard Skinner, Russ Williams, Jono Coleman, Mitch Johnson, Graham Dene, Nick Abbot, Wendy Lloyd, Tommy Vance, Emperor Rosko and Dave Fanning. Chris Evans was also hired to present a Saturday morning show, following his success at BBC GLR in the weekend mid-morning slot. The show, &quot;The Big Red Mug Show&quot;, was sponsored by Nescafé. The first song played was INXS&#x27; cover version of the Steppenwolf song &quot;Born to be Wild&quot;. Richard Branson was the first voice to be heard, live from the Virgin Megastore in Manchester, with Richard Skinner the first voice back in the London studios. Skinner was also programme director, a role he shared with John Revell. John Pearson was launch sales director, a role he had previously held at LBC. Andy Mollett was launch finance director. David Campbell, previously managing director of one of Virgin&#x27;s post-production television companies, was the chief executive at launch.

From before its launch on AM, Virgin Radio was campaigning for a national FM network. Initially, it lobbied for Radio 4&#x27;s FM network to be made available and then, when the Radio Authority launched a consultation on the use of the 105–108 MHz band, it lobbied for it to be set aside as a national network. The Radio Authority decided, however, that 105–108 MHz would be licensed to new local and regional stations and Virgin Radio applied for and won one of the new FM licences advertised in London as a result.

Virgin Radio launched on 105.8 MHz FM in London on 10 April 1995 beginning with a message from broadcaster David Frost at 6 am followed by the &quot;Russ &#x27;n&#x27; Jono breakfast show&quot;. Part of the licence requirements for the London service meant that a daily London opt-out was broadcast on FM, presented initially by Rowland Rivron.

Within a year, Virgin Group was considering the next steps for the radio station, including the option of a flotation or buying back the shares of JP Morgan, Apax and Sir David Frost. In May 1997, it was announced that Capital Radio had agreed to acquire Virgin Radio in an £87 million deal. Capital&#x27;s plans included moving Virgin Radio from 1 Golden Square to Capital&#x27;s Leicester Square building and splitting programming between the AM and FM services. The Radio Authority approved the acquisition, but Nigel Griffiths, the Consumer Affairs Minister, referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). The MMC report into the takeover would not be issued until January 1998, and would recommend that the deal could only go ahead if Capital Gold was sold or Virgin&#x27;s London FM licence was excluded from the deal. However, the delay in approval of the Capital acquisition would ultimately lead to the deal not going through.

In January 1997, Chris Evans left his role as presenter of the &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot; as a result of a disagreement between him and the programme controller Matthew Bannister (Evans had asked for Fridays off to allow more time for him to work on his Channel 4 television show, TFI Friday). Evans was keen to return to radio and it had been reported that his agent, Michael Foster, had approached Matthew Bannister to ask if Evans would be allowed to be return to Radio 1, and he had gone as far as commencing negotiations to buy Talk Radio.

Richard Branson wanted Evans to work for Virgin Radio, so much so that he joined him on a Concorde flight to New York to try to persuade him to join as the drive time presenter. In the end, Virgin Radio hired Evans to present the breakfast show, replacing the incumbent &quot;Russ &#x27;n&#x27; Jono show&quot; (presented by Russ Williams and Jonathan Coleman). His show started on 13 October 1997, the same day that Zoë Ball started as Evans&#x27; replacement on Radio 1. The initial contract would only be for ten weeks, until the MMC announced its decision on the Capital Radio takeover. Evans approached David Campbell to discuss buying the radio station and, with Michael Foster&#x27;s help, they put together a deal to buy it with venture capital supplied by Apax Partners and Paribas, with Virgin Group retaining a 20% stake in the business. The deal was announced on 8 December 1997, and would see the formation of the Ginger Media Group, an umbrella company overseeing Virgin Radio and producing programmes such as TFI Friday.

=== 1998–2000: The Ginger Media Group ===
Evans&#x27; ownership of Virgin Radio started well, with a breakfast show audience increase of 660,000 to 2.2m in his first three months. In August 1998, Evans took a spur of the moment decision one weekend to launch a Saturday afternoon show called &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Football&quot;, which continues to be broadcast on Absolute Radio. From 5 October 1998, Virgin Radio started simulcasts of the breakfast show on Sky One each morning for an hour between 7.30 and 8.30 am When a track was played on the radio, viewers would see a video at the same time.

The start of the new football season in August 1999 saw Terry Venables join Russ Williams in a show that would precede &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Football&quot;. At the end of 1999, at a time when TV programme Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? had yet to give away its top prize, Virgin Radio set a broadcasting first when Clare Barwick won £1 million at the culmination of &quot;Someone&#x27;s Going to Be a Millionaire&quot;.

The management team at the Ginger Media Group were considering expansion opportunities, including a plan to acquire the &quot;Daily Star&quot; newspaper from United News &amp; Media, and hire Piers Morgan to edit it. Their plans were stalled, however, when the shareholders got cold feet. Evans wrote in his autobiography that &quot;the management wanted to stick to our original brief of expansion, whereas our investors only cared about extracting the added value.&quot;

=== 2000–2008: SMG ownership ===
The management team therefore set itself on a strategy to sell the business three years ahead of schedule. It hired Goldman Sachs to run the sale process, and considered a public flotation, before selling to the Scottish Media Group for £225 million in March 2000. The Scottish Media Group, which owned Scottish Television and the Herald newspaper, fought off other bidders including Clear Channel, NRJ and Guardian Media Group. Evans personally made £75 million out of the sale.

Evans was subsequently fired by his new employer in 2001 for failing to report into work for five consecutive days while reportedly partying with his then wife Billie Piper.

Chief executive John Pearson, who had been with the station since before launch, resigned in April 2005, and was replaced by Fru Hazlitt, who had previously been managing director of Yahoo! UK and Ireland.

On 13 June 2006, SMG plc signed a deal with YooMedia to make Virgin Radio available on Freeview. Long before the station&#x27;s AM transmitters were closed in January 2023, it had always placed a great emphasis on other methods of transmission than medium wave, as the 1215 kHz frequency suffered from considerable interference, particularly after dark – BBC Radio 1, which used 1215 kHz for its first eleven years on air, moved to higher-quality medium wave frequencies (now used by talkSport) in 1978 primarily for this reason.

=== 2008–2013: Acquisition by Times of India and rebranding as Absolute Radio ===

On 12 April 2007, it was announced that SMG plc was to sell Virgin Radio, to enable the company to focus on its television station, STV. On 30 May 2008 SMG sold Virgin Radio to TIML Golden Square Limited, a subsidiary of The Times Group for £53.2 million, with £15 million set aside for rebranding. TIML was given 90 days&#x27; grace in which to rebrand the station. As part of the deal, Absolute Radio International, operator of two FM licences in Oxford, would manage the station.

On 1 September 2008 it was announced that Virgin Radio would be rebranded as Absolute Radio on 28 September. At the same time, changes to the line-up were made known with JK and Joel, Robin Burke, Tony Hadley and John Osborne leaving the station and Allan Lake, Joanna Russell (of Trent FM&#x27;s Jo &amp; Twiggy) and Tim Shaw joining, though Osborne would return shortly after. The last song to be played on Virgin Radio was &quot;American Pie&quot; by Don McLean and the first to be played on Absolute Radio was &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; by The Beatles. Listening figures for the final quarter of 2008 showed that almost 20% of former Virgin Radio listeners had been lost since the rebranding to Absolute Radio.

The Virgin Radio brand relaunched via DAB and online on 30 March 2016, following a new partnership with Wireless Group and approval of its digital terrestrial commercial radio licence by Ofcom in March 2015.

=== 2013–present: Acquisition by Bauer Media ===
On 29 July 2013, Bauer Media Group announced it intended to purchase Absolute from The Times Group for an amount believed to be between £20m and £25m, pending regulatory approval. The deal was cleared by the Office of Fair Trading on 23 December.

Subsequently, by September 2014, all other London-based Bauer stations moved from Mappin House to a refurbished One Golden Square, creating a new national radio hub.

Bauer Radio announced in July 2015 that Absolute Radio would be taking up the 105.2 FM frequency in the West Midlands, previously held by Planet Rock. Absolute launched on 105.2 FM on 7 September 2015. The station ended transmission on that frequency on 16 December 2018, following Bauer&#x27;s decision to broadcast Greatest Hits Radio on FM across the West Midlands.

In March 2021, Ofcom approved Bauer&#x27;s application for permission to alter the FM licence held by the London FM relay of Absolute Radio, enabling the frequency to be used to provide a London variant of Greatest Hits Radio. Absolute Radio continued to be available by way of its national AM and digital transmissions. The change took place on 17 May.

At midnight on 20 January 2023, the station stopped broadcasting on AM. Ofcom issued Bauer Radio a £25,000 fine and revoked the medium wave licence on 13 February 2023.

On 12 December 2023, Absolute Radio was removed from Freesat TV platform, followed by Sky and Virgin Media TV platforms on 13 December, along with every other radio station owned by Bauer Media on either of the three TV platforms, including Absolute Radio 80s, Absolute Radio 90s, Absolute Radio Classic Rock, Hits Radio, Greatest Hits Radio, Kiss, Magic, Jazz FM and Planet Rock.

In 2022, Bauer said it would vacate One Golden Square and move to The Lantern, 75 Hampstead Road in Euston. The last broadcasts from the Golden Square studios took place in April 2024.

== Programming ==

=== Audience and playlist ===
Virgin Radio launched aiming at a target group of 24- to 44-year-olds and with a focus on album music, arguing that &quot;singles chart shows on Radio 1 and local commercial radio were outdated because albums outsold singles by three to one.&quot; It would provide a blend of recent album tracks and chart music from the past 25 years and aim to fill the &quot;hole in the middle&quot; between BBC Radio 1 and local commercial radio, which were specifically aimed at young audiences, and &quot;gold&quot; stations offering classic hits.

A year after launch, David Campbell was quoted as saying that &quot;the music policy was wrong, even though Virgin had lots of research to suggest it was doing what listeners said they wanted. We did something we should never do: pursue critical acclaim, playing obscure tracks, gaining the praise of the music press.&quot; The station&#x27;s approach had been to mix in more familiar music.

Fru Hazlitt, when interviewed for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in September 2006, described the type of music the station championed: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty much mainstream rock festival-type music. Razorlight, Keane. These bands are becoming some of the biggest in the world.&quot;

When announcing the rebrand as Absolute Radio on the One Golden Square blog, Clive Dickens, chief operating officer, noted that the station would be &quot;sticking with real music – not manufactured rubbish – and we&#x27;re building on the amount of live music we do – we&#x27;re just going to discover more of all of it.&quot;

The music policy continues to focus on guitar-based rock, mostly British. In a blog post in February 2009, Head of Music James Curran noted that the 30 most-played artists in the first four months of Absolute Radio had been: Manic Street Preachers, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, Snow Patrol, Kings of Leon, The Killers, Oasis, Travis, U2, Placebo, Suede, Kaiser Chiefs, Kasabian, Queen, Keane, Stereophonics, Caesars, Elbow, Bruce Springsteen, R.E.M., Nickelback, The Offspring, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, Biffy Clyro, The Beatles, David Bowie, Nirvana, The Police and Blur.

=== Premium service ===
On 14 July 2022, Absolute Radio launched Absolute Radio Premium where users can listen to the various stations without advert breaks and with the ability to skip a song. The service also offers five exclusive stations: Absolute Radio Acoustic, Absolute Radio Classic Country, Andy Bush&#x27;s Indie Disco 24/7, Through the Decades and Haven&#x27;t Heard It for Ages.

=== Sport ===
From the 2010–11 to the 2015–16 seasons, Absolute Radio broadcast live commentary of 32 Premier League games on Saturday afternoons. Ian Wright joined the station to host a post-match phone-in programme, as well as a regular music show on Absolute Radio 90s and a football podcast.

From 2013 to 2014, Absolute Radio held UK radio rights to American football&#x27;s National Football League.

=== Comedy ===
In 2021, Absolute Radio commissioned its first scripted comedy series, &quot;Rockanory&quot;. Based on a number of &quot;Rock Star Babylon&quot; stories by former &quot;Now Show&quot; comedian Jon Holmes, the series featured the voices of Shaun Keaveny, Jon Culshaw and Jake Yapp. Short episodes were broadcast Monday to Thursday at 11pm for six weeks from 6 September 2021.

== Broadcast ==
=== Studios ===
The station broadcast from studios in One Golden Square until April 2024. It currently broadcasts from Bauer&#x27;s building The Lantern, near Euston railway station in London.

=== AM transmission ===
The 1215 kHz frequency (247 metres) was used, in selected areas only, by the BBC Light Programme until 1967. It was then used nationally as the original home of BBC Radio 1 until 22 November 1978, then from 23 November 1978 until 28 February 1992 by BBC Radio 3.

In 1992-1993, Virgin replaced the valve-based transmitters at the ex-BBC transmitter sites it acquired with solid-state transmitters.

Virgin Radio 1215 AM then broadcast from 30 April 1993 to 28 September 2008, and Absolute Radio 1215 AM broadcast from 29 September 2008 to 19 January 2023. 

In a number of areas, particularly where the signals from the main 1215 transmitters overlapped with each other, the station used filler transmitters on different frequencies.

=== End of AM broadcasting ===
On Wednesday 4 January 2023, Bauer Media Group announced that all the station&#x27;s remaining AM transmitters would be turned off and that it would be no longer broadcasting on AM from Friday 20 January, turning Absolute Radio into a digital-only station.

For the last few weeks, taking advantage of the separate satellite feed to the AM transmitter sites, the commercial breaks split-linked, being replaced on AM by the presenter of the show that was on reading the pending closedown script, then Leona Graham reading the same script as the station voice, then part of a radio-themed song being played before programming cut back in. On Leona&#x27;s own show, to avoid duplicating her announcement, she introduced the radio-themed songs, even fulfilling requests.

The station closed on AM at midnight on Friday 20 January 2023, with &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; by David Bowie being the last ever song being broadcast on its AM frequencies. Ten minutes before going off air, the station played a tribute to their former AM frequencies, introduced by Jay Lawrence (the presenter of the last normal show that had just been on), and starting with clips from BBC Light Programme (up to 1967), BBC Radio 1 (1967-1978) and BBC Radio 3 (1978-1992), through its life as Virgin 1215 (1993-2008) and ending with the relaunch as Absolute Radio (late 2008) and the aforementioned song. The last words the announcers said were, &quot;...and to 1215 AM: Thanks. You were brilliant.&quot; During this split link, the digital version of Absolute Radio ran an Elton John-related segment.

From midnight on Friday 20 January 2023, a closedown loop (read by Leona Graham as the station voice) carried information advising listeners stating that Absolute Radio &quot;is no longer available on AM&quot; and redirecting listeners to DAB, and the Absolute Radio mobile and smart speaker applications.

On Monday 23 January 2023, the transmitters for its AM service began to be switched off. Transmission of the closedown loop that carried information about Absolute Radio&#x27;s other platforms stopped at 2:15pm on Thursday 26 January 2023 from the station&#x27;s last AM transmitter to be switched off, in Lisnagarvey, Northern Ireland (with the very last words being &quot;thanks for listening to Absolute Radio-&quot;) but the loop remained playing on the satellite feed to the AM transmitters for many months afterwards, until that was finally removed.

=== Satellite distribution ===
In the summer of 1993, Virgin Radio began broadcasting in stereo on the Astra 1A satellite on an audio sub-carrier of the Sky News channel. This service ceased on 1 July 2001 in anticipation of Sky&#x27;s cessation of its analogue satellite service. Virgin Radio was one of the first 20 radio stations which joined the Sky Digital service on 20 November 1999. Carried on Astra 2A, it launched on the channel 917 of the Sky EPG, and then could be found on Astra 2G as Absolute Radio on channel 0107 of SKY UK EPG. Then at the end of 2023 Absolute Radio and its sister channels were removed from Sky after their owner wanted to focus on a more digital market.

Absolute Radio also broadcasts through the Eutelsat 9B satellite unencrypted signal at 12.092 MHz, H polarization, azimuth 9°E.

=== FM transmission ===
The station was available on 105.8 FM from the Crystal Palace transmitting station in London. This transmission began in 1995. In February 2021 Bauer applied to Ofcom for permission to amend the FM broadcast licence to allow the frequency to be used for a London relay of Greatest Hits Radio; Absolute Radio will remain available in London through its retained digital outlets.

On 23 March 2021, following a consultation, Ofcom announced that Greatest Hits Radio would be taking over the 105.8 FM frequency on 17 May 2021

The station was previously available in the West Midlands on 105.2 FM from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter between 7 September 2015 and 16 December 2018.

== Website and internet broadcasting ==
Virgin Radio launched its first website on 7 March 1996. Designed by AKQA, it hosted a live RealAudio stream, making it the first European radio station to stream 24-hours a day on the internet. The station went on to redesign the website a further six times as Virgin Radio. Streaming audio formats and presentation developed over time: QuickTime streaming was added in July 1999, an interactive media player launched in October 1999, an Ogg-Vorbis stream was launched in June 2003, and HE-AAC and Ogg-FLAC streams were launched in December 2009. In Autumn 2012 it launched the Opus Streaming Trial as part of the Listen Labs, including streams for all seven stations in 24, 64 and 96 kbit/s. This trial was cancelled without further notice in autumn 2014, along with the live webcams and the public playlist API.

In 2001, Virgin Radio joined the Measurecast and Arbitron internet broadcasting measurement services. Both measurement services have since closed. In 2009, Absolute Radio started publishing its internet listening and download statistics.

Virgin Radio was also among the first to explore the opportunities for delivering its services to mobile phones. It took part in a joint venture with Ericsson in 1999 to investigate the use of third-generation (3G) mobile phone technologies for radio, launched a WAP site in 2000 and took part in a trial in 2001 with Crown Castle and Manx Telecom to explore the use of 3G phones to add interactivity to digital radio broadcasts. In 2009, Absolute Radio launched an application for the Apple iPhone and tagging for the Apple iPod Nano. In 2010 applications were released for the Amazon Kindle, the Nokia Ovi Store, the BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7 and Absolute Radio was selected as a launch partner for the Apple iAd mobile advertising network.

In January 2014, Absolute Radio Network has restricted the access to the internet radio on their own website to UK listeners only, and removed their apps for iPhone and Android in non-UK app stores.

== Sister stations ==

A number of subsidiary stations to Virgin Radio and Absolute Radio have been launched as online and digital radio services over recent years, many being established during the period when SMG plc was in charge of the station. The stations were collectively known as the Virgin Radio Network (now the Absolute Radio Network). All Absolute branded channels broadcast online and via smartphone apps, with several also transmitted over DAB and digital television platforms. The line-up of stations within the network has changed over time, and those currently on air are:

=== Absolute Radio Classic Rock ===

A radio station on DAB, Virgin Media, Sky and the internet playing classic rock from the 1960s to the 1990s.

The service was rebranded as Absolute Radio Classic Rock in 2008.

=== Absolute Radio 60s ===

Launched on 22 November 2011, Absolute 60s is the sixth radio station launched under the Absolute branding. The station is broadcast on DAB, some digital television networks, and online.

=== Absolute Radio 70s ===

Launched on 29 November 2011, Absolute 70s is the seventh radio station launched under the Absolute branding. The station is broadcast on DAB and online.

=== Absolute Radio Premium ===
Bauer launched a subscription streaming service for Absolute Radio and KISS, which included five new advert-free radio services under the Absolute Radio brand, alongside the original ten Absolute Radio channels. Launching at the end of June 2022, the channels included 24/7 versions of &quot;Andy Bush&#x27;s Indie Disco&quot; programme and &quot;Haven&#x27;t Heard It For Ages&quot; programme feature, and channels called Through The Decades, Absolute Radio Classic Country and Absolute Radio Acoustic. On 14 November 2022, three more stations were added to the service called Absolute Radio 50s, Absolute Radio Movies and Absolute Radio Terrace Anthems

=== Absolute Radio You ===
This is a pop up service based around a competition, which gives the listener the chance to pitch a new service to Absolute with the winning entry appearing each February. The winning idea of the 2024 competition came from Scottish sisters Rachael and Emma Hare, and is called Absolute Radio Sisters. The service, whose strapline is ‘Where Sibling Rivalry Matters’, plays a mixture of music from the 1990s and 2000s, and will be on air from 12 to 22 February 2024. This pop-up follows Absolute Radio Natalie in 2022 ‘Where sing-alongs matter’ and Absolute Radio Kevin, which played debut singles and tracks from debut albums in 2023

=== Absolute Radio Calm ===
This pop up station was launched on 13 May 2024 during Mental Health Awareness Week and will be available for two weeks. It features calming sounds rather than music. It is available on the Absolute Radio app and on smart speakers.

== Former spin-off stations ==
=== Absolute Radio Extra ===
Established in 2010, Absolute Radio Extra enabled Absolute to carry its Premier League football coverage on DAB. During match coverage, the analogue frequencies of Absolute were split, with the London 105.8 FM service carrying scores-and-music show &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Football&quot;, and the national 1215 AM service carrying match commentary. On DAB, the main Absolute service carried &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Football&quot;, with Extra carrying match commentary. Extra was also used for coverage of music festivals and events (such as V Festival) in addition to the coverage available on the main station.

Absolute Radio Extra has subsequently ceased operation: the core Absolute service on DAB continues to relay the shared programming output of the national AM/London FM service.

=== Absolute Radio 40s ===
Absolute Radio 40s was a pop-up station in May 2020, which celebrated the 75th anniversary of VE Day. The station used the 1215 MW frequency to play songs from The Andrews Sisters, Vera Lynn, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland, Glenn Miller, Bing Crosby, Doris Day and Gracie Fields for 24 hours with Dave Berry, Leona Graham and Claire Sturgess presenting shows, which included archive and reminisces from VE Day veterans. Absolute Radio 40s was also found online and on DAB.

=== Absolute Xtreme ===

A radio station on DAB, Virgin Media, Sky and the Internet, playing new music. Absolute Xtreme was launched (as Virgin Radio Xtreme) on 5 September 2005, by Lali Parikh (Station Manager) with Steve Harris being the main on-air talent. On 4 December 2009, Absolute Xtreme was replaced on DAB and digital TV by Absolute Radio 80s.

== Other pre-Absolute spin-off stations ==

=== dabbl ===

dabbl was a user-controlled music radio station broadcast on the Internet and selected local DAB multiplexes 24 hours a day, and on DAB in London from 7 pm to 6 am daily. Its content was chosen by members of Absolute&#x27;s VIP Service, who selected songs which were then voted for, and songs with the most votes were played. dabbl has now ceased, its DAB slots outside London taken by Absolute Radio 90s.

=== Liquid ===
Liquid was a station playing indie, alternative and Britpop. It ran on DAB in London between 2000 and 2004, with its slot taken by Virgin Radio Classic Rock (now Absolute Classic Rock).

<text>The Ring of Kerry () is a circular tourist route in County Kerry, south-western Ireland. Clockwise from Killarney it follows the N71 to Kenmare, then the N70 around the Iveragh Peninsula to Killorglin – passing through Sneem, Waterville, Cahersiveen, and Glenbeigh – before returning to Killarney via the N72.

==Attractions==
Popular points include Muckross House (near Killarney), Staigue stone fort and Derrynane House, home of Daniel O&#x27;Connell. Just south of Killarney, Ross Castle, Lough Leane, and Ladies View (a panoramic viewpoint), all located within Killarney National Park, are major attractions located along the Ring. A more complete list of major attractions along the Ring of Kerry includes: Gap of Dunloe, Bog Village, Dunloe Ogham Stones, Kerry Woollen Mills, Rossbeigh Beach, Cahersiveen Heritage Centre, Derrynane House, Skellig Experience, Staigue Fort, Kenmare Lace, Moll&#x27;s Gap, Ballymalis Castle, Ladies View, Torc Waterfall, Muckross House, The Blue Pool, Ross Castle, Ogham Stones, St Mary’s Cathedral, Muckross Abbey, Franciscan Friary, Kellegy Church, O’Connell Memorial Church, Sneem Church and Cemetery, Skellig Michael (off the coast), Beehive Cells and the Stone Pillars marking an important grave.

==Routes==
There is also an established walking path named The Kerry Way, which takes its own route, and a signposted Ring of Kerry cycling path which uses older quieter roads where possible. The Kerry Way roughly follows the scenic driving route of the Ring of Kerry.

There are numerous variations to the route taking in St. Finian&#x27;s Bay and Valentia Island which the official driving ring misses (the official cycling route takes in Valentia Island). As well as beaches, it also offers the Gap of Dunloe, Bog Village, Derrynane House, the Skellig Experience Valentia Island, Moll&#x27;s Gap, Torc Waterfall, Muckross House, and Ross Castle.

&quot;The Ring&quot; is a popular day trip and numerous bus companies offer circuits during the summer months. As the narrow roads make it difficult for tour coaches to pass one another, all tour buses run in an anti-clockwise direction, travelling via Killorglin first. Some recommend that car owners travel in the opposite direction, going first to Kenmare to avoid delays caused by tour buses. Others advise travelling counter-clockwise to avoid having to pass the buses. In 2008 satellite navigation systems were blamed for directing bus drivers in a clockwise direction around the route.

<doc id="571857" wikidata="Q982650" url="?curid=571857" title="Jacques Kallis">
<text>Jacques Henry Kallis OIS (born 16 October 1975) is a South African cricket coach and former professional cricketer. Widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers of all time and as one of the greatest all-rounders ever to play the game, he was a right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium swing bowler. , Kallis is the only cricketer in the history of the game to score more than 10,000 runs and take over 250 wickets in both ODI and Test match cricket. He has also taken 131 ODI catches. He scored 13,289 runs in his Test match career, took 292 wickets, and 200 catches. Kallis scored 45 Test match centuries and is the third highest test match run scorer in history. Kallis won 23 Man-of-the-Match awards, the most by any player in Test history.

He was declared the &quot;Player of the Tournament&quot; in South Africa&#x27;s victorious 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy (now referred to as ICC Champions Trophy) campaign, which to date is South Africa&#x27;s only ICC tournament win in their history. Kallis finished as the 2nd highest run-scorer in the tournament and was its leading wicket taker with Man-of-the-Match awards in both the semi-final and the final.
In the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy Final, Kallis picked up a spell of 5 wickets for 30 runs.

Kallis played 166 Test matches and had a batting average of over 55 runs. From October to December 2007, he scored five centuries in four Test matches. With his century in the second innings of the third Test against India in January 2011, his 40th in all, he moved past Ricky Ponting to become the second-highest scorer of Test centuries, behind only Sachin Tendulkar&#x27;s 51.

Kallis was named Leading Cricketer in the World in 2008 Wisden for his performances in 2007 in addition to being the &quot;ICC Test Player of the Year&quot; and ICC Player of the Year in 2005. He has been described by Kevin Pietersen, Ricky Ponting and Daryll Cullinan as the greatest cricketer to play the game, and along with Wally Hammond and Sir Garry Sobers is one of the few Test all-rounders whose Test batting average is over 50 and exceeds his Test bowling average by 20 or more.

Kallis became the fourth player and first South African to score 13,000 Test runs on the opening day of the first Test against New Zealand on 2 January 2013. He was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2013. He retired from Test and first-class cricket after playing in the second test against India at Durban in December 2013; Kallis scored his 45th Test hundred in this match, making him one of the few batsmen to score a century in his final Test. He retired from all forms of international cricket on 30 July 2014.

In December 2019, it was announced that Jacques Kallis would rejoin the South African national cricket team, The Proteas, as the team&#x27;s batting consultant for the duration of the summer. In August 2020, he was inducted to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

== Playing career ==
=== Early career and 1996 Cricket World Cup ===
Kallis attended and played cricket for Wynberg Boys&#x27; High School. In 2009 Wynberg honoured Kallis by naming their main cricket oval after him. In July 1993 he was picked for South Africa U-17&#x27;s against Scotland&#x27;s U-19 team.

He made his first-class debut in 1993/94 as an 18-year-old, playing for Western Province B. Still 18, Kallis played league cricket in England for Old Edwardians in Solihull in 1994, where coaching staff saw the potential for him to become a first-class all-rounder; the following summer he played for Netherfield in Kendal, scoring 791 runs at an average of 98.87 from 14 matches.

His first Test appearance was on 14–18 December 1995 against England in Durban, but he struggled with the bat in his first few matches. Kallis made his World Cup debut in 1996 in Pakistan but did not have much opportunity to excel. His breakthrough came in 1997, with 61 against Pakistan, and then two matches later, he salvaged a draw for South Africa with a fighting century against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

=== 1998–2002 ===
Between 1998 and 2002, Jacques Kallis was one of the world&#x27;s leading all-rounders, as seen in the ICC&#x27;s cricket ratings. In 1998, he led South Africa to the ICC Champions Trophy title with two &quot;Man of the Match&quot; and the &quot;Player of the Series&quot; performances. The youngster was solid, without being spectacular, in the 1999 ICC Cricket World Cup, before a &quot;Player of the Series&quot; performance led South Africa to a stunning Test series victory against India in India in 2000. By late 2001 he was the world&#x27;s number one ranked Test all-rounder, having held the same ranking in ODIs for the best part of 3 years. During this time, &quot;Kallis blossomed into arguably the world&#x27;s leading batsman, with a defensive technique second to none, and the adhesive qualities of a Cape Point limpet. Generally a placid and undemonstrative man, he nailed down the crucial No. 3 positions in the South African batting order after several players had been tried and discarded, and his stock rose exponentially from that moment.&quot; 

=== 2003–2014 ===
Kallis is one of only four players in Test history (after Sir Donald Bradman and before Mohammad Yousuf and Gautam Gambhir) to make a century in five consecutive matches, which he achieved in the 2003/04 season. For his performances in 2004, 2005, and 2008, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC. He was also named in the World ODI XI by the ICC for the year 2004 and 12th man for XI in 2005. He was also selected for the ODI XI in 2007 as well. In 2005, he set the record for the fastest half-century in Test cricket history, scoring 50 against Zimbabwe off only 24 balls. In 2007, Kallis scored five centuries in four Tests, making him just the fourth man after Bradman, Ken Barrington and Matthew Hayden to score four centuries in four Tests on two different occasions. Kallis has a remarkable batting average in the mid-50s, and was consistently rated as one of the best batsmen in the world. Although a very capable bowler with 292 Test wickets, he impressed mostly with the bat between 2005 and 2007. As a result, he evolved into more of a batting all-rounder, a role in which he continued because of the emergence of Dale Steyn, Morné Morkel, and Vernon Philander. Kallis is the only man to score over 10,000 runs and to take over 200 wickets in Test cricket. Sir Garfield Sobers managed over 8,000 runs and 200 wickets by comparison, at very similar averages, although Sobers achieved this feat in just 93 tests compared to Kallis’ 166.

In 2005, Kallis was selected for the World XI team to play an Asian XI in a benefit match for those affected by the tsunami of 2004, along with countryman Shaun Pollock. In the same year, he was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for the ICC player of the year. The award was shared with Andrew Flintoff of England, his only serious competitor as the world&#x27;s leading all-rounder, after the votes of the academy were tied. Kallis also won the &quot;ICC Test Player of the Year&quot; award that year.

In 2006, Kallis was awarded the captaincy of South Africa for the third and final Test match against Australia when Graeme Smith withdrew with an injury.

In the 2007 World Cup, Kallis was South Africa&#x27;s leading run-scorer with 485 runs at 80.83. He was, however, criticized in the press for scoring slowly, which cost South Africa momentum at key stages in the tournament. In August 2007, he was omitted from the 15-man South Africa squad for 2007 ICC World Twenty20, and consequently resigned as vice-captain. He was restored to the team for the Test series against Pakistan, where he scored three centuries in four innings and was awarded &quot;Man of the Match&quot; twice and &quot;Player of the Series&quot;.

Following his successful tour of Pakistan, Kallis scored two aggressive centuries in matches against New Zealand at Johannesburg&#x27;s Wanderer&#x27;s Stadium and Centurion Park in Pretoria, taking his total century count to five in four matches. Following this purple patch of form, Kallis endured three tours without success in the form of hundreds, although the Proteas secured historic series victories in England and Australia, and won a two-match series against Bangladesh at home.

Kallis returned to form after an indifferent 2008 and averaged over 50 in his next six series. During this time, the Proteas won one series (against West Indies), drew four (two against India, one against England, and one against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates), and lost one series to a resilient Australia. Kallis scored 173 in Nagpur in 2010. In the Centurion Test against India later in the year, he scored his maiden double-century in Test match cricket. His 201 not out came in a landslide victory for South Africa, as two of the team&#x27;s future batting stars contributed significant hundreds of their own (AB de Villiers and future captain Hashim Amla). For the second time in his career, Kallis scored twin centuries in a match, during the third Test of the series at his home ground, Newlands in Cape Town.

In January 2012, Kallis scored his highest score in Tests – 224 against Sri Lanka at Newlands. The last eight series that Kallis played in for South Africa were all victories for the Proteas, except for one series draw against Pakistan in the UAE. Kallis became one of the few players in world cricket to have won two series each in England and Australia. The Proteas also won two series against New Zealand and one against each of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, England, and Australia.

Throughout this period of his career, Kallis was still valued for his bowling. He contributed valuable economical overs and had a knack for taking important wickets.

In September 2014, Kallis signed a one-year contract with the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League. In his first appearance for the Thunder he scored an important innings of 97* and picked up a wicket.

=== 2008–2013: The senior all-rounder ===
In 2008 more responsibility was placed on Kallis as an all-rounder due to the retirement of Shaun Pollock. Despite the pressure, an all-rounder began to emerge in Wayne Parnell who did some good lower-order batting.
Kallis endured an uncharacteristically poor 2008 with the bat, averaging well under thirty for much of it. Against the ninth-ranked Bangladesh, he averaged just 25.75 in four Test outings. He also played for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League, where he averaged 16.85 runs per innings with the bat and 55.5 runs per wicket with the ball at an economy rate of 9.65 in the 7 matches he played before he was dropped.

==== Home and away series against Australia (2008–09) ====

South Africa toured Australia for a three-match Test series and five-match ODI series starting in December 2008. The tourists had a successful 9–2 Test win–loss ratio in 2008; however, Australia had just come off a 2–0 away series defeat against India and had a 5–3 ratio for the calendar year. Before the series, Kallis had a batting average of 38.32 in 18 Tests against the number one ranked team, substantially lower than his overall average of 55.06. Despite an average of 124.50 in 12 Tests against lowly ranked Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, former Australia fast-bowler Rodney Hogg labeled the all-rounder &quot;a flat-track bully, who dishes it out to the minnows like Bangladesh and Zimbabwe but goes missing against the Australians.&quot; In the first Test starting on 17 December, Kallis scored 63 in South Africa&#x27;s first innings, before he was dismissed by Mitchell Johnson, in the midst of a bowling spell consisting of 5/2 in 20 balls. After failing to make a breakthrough in Australia&#x27;s first innings, Kallis took 3/24 in their second, while completing four catches in the match. He then scored 57, while being involved in a 124-run partnership with AB de Villiers, as South Africa chased down 414, the second-highest fourth-innings run-chase in Test history.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa in Australia Test Series - 1st Test - 2008/09&quot;&gt;&quot;South Africa in Australia Test Series – 1st Test – 2008/09&quot;, ESPNcricinfo, accessed 11 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the second Test in Melbourne starting on Boxing Day, Kallis struggled to be potent in Australia&#x27;s first innings, taking 1/55. While making a start in his team&#x27;s first dig, he managed only 26, before taking 2/57 when the home-side batted again. Chasing just 183, Kallis was not required to bat, as South Africa completed their first Test series victory in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa in Australia Test Series - 2nd Test - 2008/09&quot;&gt;&quot;South Africa in Australia Test Series – 2nd Test – 2008/09&quot;, ESPNcricinfo, accessed 11 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia&#x27;s 103 run Third Test victory in Sydney, Kallis struggled, taking 1/54 and 0/13 with the ball, while scoring 37 and four with the bat.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa in Australia Test Series - 3rd Test - 2008/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The win was South Africa&#x27;s 11th in a year in which they drew with India in India, defeated England in England, Australia in Australia, and also recorded series wins over West Indies and Bangladesh. Kallis was featured in all of those matches and remains an integral part of the champion side&#x27;s set-up.

For his performances in 2010, 2011 and 2012, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC.

On 10 April 2013 he was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 2013.

=== Injuries, continued achievement and records ===
Kallis participated in the tour of the West Indies, in which he scored his 35th test cricket century. Kallis injured his neck during the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 playing for the Royal Challengers Bangalore and missed the Twenty20 and ODI series against Zimbabwe. He returned for the ODI series against Pakistan, scoring 66 before having to retire hurt with a cramp. He did, however, manage to lay the foundations for an eight-wicket victory.

For his performances in 2010 and 2012, he was named in the ESPNcricinfo IPL XI..

In the same ODI Jacques Kallis scored his 129th ODI six, a record for a South African in the format. However, he picked up an injury and was a doubtful starter for the second ODI. In December 2010, on the 3rd day of the first test against India, Kallis scored his maiden double century, scoring 201* (not out). Kallis was selected by South Africa for the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.

In the 2011–12 season, Kallis scored his second double century in Test cricket, reaching 224 in South Africa&#x27;s first innings of the third Test of the home series against Sri Lanka. The Test was Kallis&#x27;s 150th; he became the sixth player in history and the first South African to reach this milestone. After the series, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said that he considered Kallis to be the &quot;most-effective player&quot; in Test cricket. Brett Lee named Kallis as the best player in the world in an interview after their victory for Kolkata Knight Riders for his performance in IPL 2012 final against Chennai Super Kings.

He played a crucial role in the qualification of the Royal Challengers Bangalore for the Champions League T20 during IPL-3 and later on played a crucial role in the triumph of Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL-5, scoring a total of 407 runs and taking 15 wickets.

In August 2023, at the age of 47, Kallis played in the California Knights’ opening match in the US Masters T10. He scored an unbeaten 64 off 31 balls.

== Coaching career ==
Kallis was appointed head coach of Kolkata Knight Riders in October 2015 when head coach Trevor Bayliss resigned to take over as head coach of England cricket team in June 2015. Kallis was also batting consultant of KKR for 2015 Indian Premier League season.

In December 2019, Kallis was appointed as batting consultant for South Africa national cricket team. As of late 2020 he is a batting consultant for the England national cricket team.

== Playing style and comparisons ==
Kallis has earned high praise for his orthodox batting technique. In an article for the &quot;Telegraph&quot; in July 2012, former England batsman and captain Michael Vaughan wrote that Kallis, &quot;as a batsman, is the best player in the world.&quot;. He described Kallis&#x27;s batting in more detail:
Whether on the front or back foot, he plays well on the on- and off-side. He’s not Brian Lara or Ricky Ponting in terms of aggression or flair but he is rock solid and, added to that, has every shot in the book.
Also, his cover drive and flick off the hip are right up there in terms of execution and attractiveness. ... He can score quickly at times but it is his way of being able to read situations that sets him apart. ... He knows when to grind it out or move up through the gears. Some people think he could move through the gears quicker when batting, and that is probably a fair argument on occasions, but the majority of the time he knows what he can do at the crease and believes South Africa has a better chance of winning if he stays there.

Given his impressive all-around record, Kallis has also been compared with Sir Garfield Sobers. In November 2012, noted journalist Gideon Haigh wrote in &quot;The Australian&quot; that statistically, they were almost inseparable; Sobers scored 8032 at an average of 58 and took 235 wickets at an average of 34, while Kallis at the time of writing averaged 57 with the bat and 33 with the ball. Haigh also analysed how Kallis and Sobers were also polar opposites in certain ways:
Sobers [was] all prowling grace and feline elasticity, with his 360-degree batswing and three-in-one bowling; [whereas] Kallis [is] all looming bulk and latent power, constructed like a work of neo-brutalist architecture. ... Yet what they are just as many opposites of are their respective eras. Sobers was the most explosive cricketer of a more staid age, the more mercurial because of the orthodoxy and rigidity around him; Kallis is the most stoic and remorseless cricketer of an era more ostentatious and histrionic. ... Sobers was a cavalier among roundheads; Kallis has steadily become a roundhead among cavaliers.

== Personal life ==
Kallis shared a close relationship with his father, Henry, whom Kallis cited as his primary influence. His sister Janine Kallis, five years his junior, was a cheerleader in Indian Premier League 2009 and is also a physiotherapist based in East London. When it was discovered that his father had terminal cancer, Kallis took time out of cricket to be with his father:

We heard something was wrong with my dad during the [2003] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we&#x27;ve always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It gave me a chance to say thank you and goodbye. After a while, I realized how lucky I was to do that. It&#x27;s far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It&#x27;s just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.

In January 2019, Kallis married Charlene Engels. The couple has a son, born on 11 March 2020.

== Jacques Kallis Scholarship Foundation ==
The Jacques Kallis Scholarship Foundation was established in Kallis&#x27;s benefit year to combine the academic and life skills programs of existing school structures with funding and mentoring support from Jacques Kallis. The Foundation with its partners hopes to provide talented youngsters the opportunity to reach their full sporting and academic potential.

Currently, the Foundation sponsors 2 boys from Wynberg Boys&#x27;, 2 boys from Pretoria Boys High School, 2 from Maritzburg College, and 2 from Selborne College. Jacques Kallis participates in annual fundraising events for his Foundation, to which he invites fellow South African celebrities and cricketers like Mark Boucher and André Nel.

<text>Michael O&#x27;Hanrahan (; 16 January 1877 – 4 May 1916) was an Irish rebel who was executed for his active role in the 1916 Easter Rising.

==Background==
He was born as Michael Hanrahan in New Ross, County Wexford, Ireland, the son of Richard Hanrahan, a cork cutter, and Mary Williams. His father appears to have been involved in the 1867 Fenian rising. The family moved to Carlow, where Michael was educated at Carlow Christian Brothers&#x27; School and Carlow College Academy. On leaving school he worked various jobs including a period alongside his father in the cork-cutting business. In 1898 he joined the Gaelic League and in 1899 founded the League&#x27;s first Carlow branch and became its secretary. Also in 1899 he helped found a Workingmen&#x27;s club in Carlow. By 1903 he was in Dublin, where he was working as a proof-reader for the Gaelic League printer An Cló Cumann. He published journalism under the by-lines &#x27;Art&#x27; and &#x27;Irish Reader&#x27; in several nationalist newspapers, including &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; and the &quot;Irish Volunteer&quot;. He was the author of two novels &quot;A Swordsman of the Brigade&quot; (1914) and &quot;When the Norman Came&quot; (published posthumously in 1918).

==Political involvement==
In 1903 he became involved in Maud Gonne and Arthur Griffith&#x27;s campaign against the visit of King Edward VII to Ireland. The encounter with Griffith led O&#x27;Hanrahan to join the newly formed Sinn Féin. He also became a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. In November 1913 he joined the Irish Volunteers. O&#x27;Hanrahan was later employed as an administrator on the Volunteers headquarters staff. He was made quartermaster general of the 2nd Battalion. He and the commandant of the 2nd Battalion Thomas MacDonagh became close friends.

==1916 Easter Rising==
He was second in command of Dublin&#x27;s 2nd battalion under Commandant Thomas MacDonagh. He fought at Jacob&#x27;s Biscuit Factory, though the battalion saw little action other than intense sniping throughout Easter week, as the British Army largely kept clear of the impregnable factory dominating the road from Portobello Barracks on one side and Dublin Castle on the other. When in May the situation became desperate O&#x27;Hanrahan told his commanding officer MacDonagh they &quot;were inviting destruction of the factory by incendiary shells, and also of the surrounding thickly populated area&quot;. MacDonagh ordered a break-out amidst the chaos and confusion. O&#x27;Hanrahan led &quot;with some difficulty&quot; the garrison out of the factory through New Bride Street gate.

O&#x27;Hanrahan was executed by firing squad on 4 May 1916 at Kilmainham Gaol. His brother, Henry O&#x27;Hanrahan, was sentenced to penal servitude for life for his role in the Easter Rising.
===Commemoration===
Wexford railway station is named in commemoration of O&#x27;Hanrahan, as is the road bridge over the River Barrow at New Ross. Two Gaelic games sports clubs are named after him: Geraldine O&#x27;Hanrahans GAA (New Ross) and O&#x27;Hanrahans GFC (Carlow town).

<text>William R. Forstchen (born October 11, 1950) is an American historian and author. A Professor of History and Faculty Fellow at Montreat College, in Montreat, North Carolina, he received his doctorate from Purdue University.

He has published numerous popular novels and non-fiction works about military and alternative history, thrillers, and speculative events. His three alternate novels of the Civil War were co-written with politician Newt Gingrich; two also had the participation of writer Albert S. Hanser. He and the other two men have also written three novels about General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.

==Early life and education==
Forstchen was born and grew up in Millburn, New Jersey. He attended Hightstown High School. He completed his doctorate at Purdue University, studying under the historian Gunther E. Rothenberg. He specialized in Military History, the American Civil War, and the History of Technology. His doctoral dissertation was &quot;The 28th USCTs: Indiana&#x27;s African-Americans Go to War, 1863–1865&quot;.

Fortschen has been a resident of Hightstown, New Jersey.

== Writing ==
In addition to academic writing, Forstchen has written articles, published in such venues as &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, and novels for both adults and young adults. He has published nearly fifty books. His young adult novel, &quot;We Look Like Men of War&quot;, is about an African-American regiment that fought in the Civil War at the Battle of the Crater. It is based on material he originally developed for his dissertation.

Since the late 20th century, Forstchen has shifted toward writing historical fiction and alternate history. In non-fiction he has concentrated on history and technological issues.

=== John Matherson series ===
Dr. Forstchen&#x27;s novel, &quot;One Second After&quot; (2009, Tor/Forge/St. Martin&#x27;s books) reached the &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller list; it was on the list for twelve weeks. The sequel, &quot;One Year After&quot;, was released in 2015. The concluding work of the trilogy, &quot;The Final Day&quot;, was released on January 4, 2017. All three of the books in what is now called &quot;The John Matherson Series&quot; achieved NYT best seller status.

Forstchen based his research for &quot;One Second After&quot; on the 2004 bipartisan Congressional study of the potential threat to the continental United States from an EMP attack: &quot;Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack&quot;. Drawing on this and other government and private studies, Forstchen explores in his novel what might happen in a &quot;typical&quot; American town in the wake of an attack with electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) weapons. Forstchen has been invited to make presentations regarding the threat of EMP before members of Congress, and at STRATCOM, Sandia Labs, and NASA.

=== Other works ===
Forstchen&#x27;s novel &quot;Pillar to the Sky&quot; (2014) explores the concept of a Space Elevator. The tower would rise from the equator to geostationary orbit and beyond in order to revolutionize space transportation in the 21st century. Forstchen&#x27;s thesis is that the building of such a permanent transportation system to high Earth orbit would reignite America&#x27;s economic and technological prominence in the 21st century. He promoted the idea that such a tower could be used to &quot;hot wire” limitless non-polluting energy from solar panels deployed in space and free peoples on Earth from dependence on greenhouse gas-emitting energy production.

Forstchen has self-published two novellas. &quot;Day of Wrath&quot; (2014) is about an ISIS-inspired attack on United States public schools. &quot;Twin Flame&quot; (2017), co-authored with author Nora D&#x27;Ecclesis, is a &quot;biographical novella&quot;. He explores the history of his relationship with his former wife Robin.

<doc id="571875" wikidata="Q3321084" url="?curid=571875" title="Michael Mallin">
<text>Michael Thomas Christopher Mallin (; 1 December 1874 – 8 May 1916) was an Irish republican, Socialist and devout Catholic who took an active role in the Easter Rising of 1916. He was a silk weaver, the co-founder with Francis Sheehy-Skeffington of the Socialist Party of Ireland, and was second-in-command of the Irish Citizen Army under James Connolly in the Easter Rising, in which he commanded the garrison at St. Stephen&#x27;s Green in Dublin.

==Background==
Mallin was born in Dublin, the eldest of nine children of John Mallin, a carpenter, and his wife Sarah (&quot;née&quot; Dowling). The family lived in a tenement in the Liberties neighbourhood. He received his early education at the National School at Denmark Street. When he was 15 he visited his uncle James Dowling, who was a member of the British Army as a pay sergeant, and was persuaded to enlist in the army as a drummer. Mallin&#x27;s mother witnessed the public execution of the Manchester Martyrs. According to his brother Thomas, their father was a &quot;strong nationalist and he and Michael had many a political argument&quot;.

==British Army career==
Mallin enrolled as a soldier with the British Army&#x27;s 21st Royal Scots Fusiliers on 21 October 1889. During the early years of his service he was stationed in Great Britain and Ireland. His regiment was sent to India in 1896, where he served out the remainder of his almost fourteen-year career, taking part in the Tirah Campaign. It was during his time in India that he became radicalised. In 1897, when asked to donate to the memorial fund for Queen Victoria&#x27;s jubilee year he refused because &#x27;he could not subscribe as the English monarch had taken an oath to uphold the Protestant faith&#x27;. Mallin&#x27;s brother, Thomas, later suggested that incidents such as this kept him from being promoted any higher than a drummer. He was awarded the India Medal of 1895 with the Punjab Frontier and Tirah clasps 1897–98.

==Post army life==
On Mallin&#x27;s return to Ireland, he became a silk weaver&#x27;s apprentice under his uncle James, who was also a former soldier in the British Army.

He became active in politics, and was the secretary of the Socialist Party of Ireland. He progressed to become a leading official in the silk weavers&#x27; union. During the 1913 Lockout, he led a strike of silk workers at the Hanbury Lane factory. The strike lasted for thirteen weeks, with Mallin an effective negotiator on behalf of the strikers. He was appointed second-in-command and chief training officer of the Irish Citizen Army (ICA), which was formed to protect workers from the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP) and from employer-funded gangs of strike-breakers. Under the tutelage of Mallin and James Connolly, the ICA became an effective military force. He was also appointed chief of staff of the ICA in October 1914.

==Easter Rising==

When Connolly was inducted into the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) in January 1916, Mallin began preparing ICA members for the imminent armed revolution. In the week before the operation he communicated orders to the ICA members throughout the city. On Easter Monday, Mallin departed from Liberty Hall at 11:30 am to take up a position at St Stephen&#x27;s Green with a small force of ICA men and women. Upon arriving at the park they ordered civilians out of it, dug trenches, erected kitchen and first aid stations, and built barricades in the surrounding streets. Constance Markievicz arrived and was originally thought to have been appointed Mallin&#x27;s second-in-command, but later evidence pointed to this role belonging to Captain Christopher Poole, with Markievicz being third-in-command.

Mallin planned to occupy the Shelbourne Hotel, located on the north-east side of the park, but insufficient manpower prevented him from doing so. This would prove disastrous for the revolutionaries as the British Army during the subsequent fighting was able to occupy the upper floors of the hotel on Monday night. Early Tuesday morning the British Army forces in the Shelbourne began firing down on the encamped rebels. Under intense fire, Mallin ordered his troops to retreat to the Royal College of Surgeons on the west side of the park. The garrison remained in the barricaded building for the remainder of the week. By Thursday it was cut off from the rebel headquarters at the General Post Office (GPO), and running out of food and ammunition.

As the evacuation of Stephen&#x27;s Green was ongoing Mallin had a close call. Margaret Skinnider records in her autobiography that &quot;I had ridden ahead to report to Commandant Mallin, and while he stood listening to me, a bullet whizzed through his hat. He took it off, looked at it without comment, and put it on again&quot;.

On Sunday 30 April 1916, just one week after the commencement of the Easter Rising and the declaration of the Irish Republic, Commandant Michael Mallin, Chief of Staff of the Irish Citizen Army was ordered to surrender his garrison at the College of Surgeons, St. Stephen&#x27;s Green. The order to surrender was signed by James Connolly and P.H Pearse, delivered to Mallin by Nurse Elizabeth O&#x27;Farrell. 
After an intense week of fighting, exhausted and hungry Mallin wrote a note to his wife Agnes. The note was written on the inside of a used envelope that has been torn open at the sides. It read – &quot;My darling wife all is lost. My love to all my children, no matter what my fate I am satisfied I have done my duty to my beloved Ireland, and you, and to my darling children. I charge you as their sole guardian now to bring them up in the national faith of your father, and of my faith, of our unborn child [may] God and his blessed Mother help you and it. I said all was lost, I meant all but honour and courage. God and his blessed Mother again guard and keep you my own darling wife&quot;.

Mallin obeyed the order and surrendered his position to Captain H.E. De Courcy-Wheeler, Staff Captain to General Lowe, acting Commander of British troops in Ireland. Mallin and the men and women under his command were arrested and taken prisoner. They were escorted first to Ship Street Barracks at Dublin Castle then on to Richmond Barracks, at Inchicore where Mallin was separated for court-martial. Mallin was court-martialled on 5 May, found guilty of the charge of treason and he was executed by firing squad in the stonebreaker&#x27;s yard at Kilmainham Gaol at sunrise on 8 May 1916.

The summary trial by field general court-martial, an all-military court, was held in-camera. There was no jury in the court, and no independent observers or members of the public were permitted to attend. The trial was hardly impartial, and there was certainly a significant conflict of interest in the selection of the president of the court. The trial lasted less than 15 minutes. The court president was Brigadier Ernest Maconchy and the other members of the court-martial were, Lieutenant Colonel A.M. Bent, and Major F.W Woodward. The prosecuting officer was Ernest Longworth, a commissioned officer in the Training Corps at Trinity College, and a member of the Irish Bar. Mallin had no legal representation during the proceedings. The principal witness for the prosecution was Captain De Courcy-Wheeler. His eye-witness account of the surrender is presented in his evidence to the court-martial, and his first-hand account of the surrender and court-martial was presented in his memoir. He stated to the court-martial that &quot;the prisoner [Mallin] came forward…. saluted and said he wished to surrender ….and stated he was the Commandant of the garrison&quot;. Mallin didn&#x27;t challenge Captain De Courcy-Wheeler&#x27;s statements. According to Wheeler, when Mallin was asked if he wished to question him, Mallin replied...No.

Furthermore, according to Capt. De Courcy-Wheeler, when Mallin was given leave to speak he used the opportunity to thank Capt. Wheeler for his courtesy during the surrender... &quot;[Mallin] I wish it placed on record how grateful my comrades and myself are for the kindness and consideration which Captain Wheeler has shown to us during this time&quot;. The court president acknowledged the request and agreed that Mallin&#x27;s expression of gratitude would be recorded in the court record. However, despite the promise made by the court president, Brigadier Maconchy, none of this was recorded in the court-martial record. Mallin knew he was a condemned man, and that nothing he could say to the court martial would alter that fact. It is a fallacy to suggest that Commandant Mallin denied his command and responsibility for his garrison. The words in this court-martial record are the uncorroborated hand-written words of one man, the president of the court-martial and his words by his own admission &quot;they are, in many cases, my own words&quot;. Captain De Courcy-Wheeler&#x27;s first-hand account of the court-martial identifies and confirms these significant and important omissions from the court-martial record.

The motives behind what would seem to be deliberate omissions from the trial record, and the statements ascribed to Mallin, would indicate that there were some old scores to settle with Mallin; not least from Mallin&#x27;s former career in the British Army; and this was an opportunity to settle that score. This court-martial record in itself was a double edged sword designed to discredit Mallin and at the same time indict Countess Markievicz by providing evidence that would confirm her execution.

General Maxwell, newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of British Army in Ireland, had already expressed his own motives for wanting to execute Markievicz. He considered her &quot;bloody guilty and dangerous …a woman who forfeited the privileges of her sex …we can&#x27;t allow our soldiers to be shot down by such like….Lord French agreed with Maxwell…personally I agree with you she ought to be shot&quot;. Maxwell needed a weight of evidence against Markievicz if he was to convince Prime Minister Asquith to accept his decision to confirm her death sentence. The court-martial of Mallin presented Maxwell with the opportunity to place Markievicz in a commanding role and thereby strengthen his hand to execute her as a &quot;ringleader of the rebellion&quot; those guilty of cold blooded murder...a phrase frequently repeated by the Prime Minister Asquith and General Maxwell. However, Asquith insisted that no woman should be executed. Consequently, the sentence of death on Countess Markievicz was commuted to penal servitude for life by a reluctant Maxwell.

==Execution and commemoration==

Mallin was executed by firing squad on 8 May 1916. The presiding officer at his court martial was Colonel EWSK Maconchy. The night before his execution he was visited in his cell by his mother, three of his siblings, his pregnant wife and their four children. In his last letter to his wife, who was pregnant with their fifth child, Mallin stated that &quot;I find no fault with the soldiers or the police&quot; and asked her &quot;to pray for all the souls who fell in this fight, Irish and English.&quot; He commented &quot;so must Irishmen pay for trying to make Ireland a free nation.&quot; He wrote to his children &#x27;Una my little one be a Nun, Joseph my little man be a Priest if you can, James &amp; John to you the care of your mother make yourselves good strong men for her sake and remember Ireland&#x27; Both Una and Joseph followed his wishes. His funeral mass took place at the Dominican Church in Tallaght on 13 May 1916. People from the procession clashed with police outside the church with two policemen injured.

Dún Laoghaire Mallin DART station is named after Mallin.

==Family==
Mallin married Agnes Hickey (born in 1870), whom he had met during his early home service in the Army, in 1903. They had three sons and two daughters, the youngest born 4 months after Mallin&#x27;s execution.

His youngest son, Fr. Joseph Mallin SJ, born on 13 September 1913, was a Jesuit priest and teacher in Hong Kong. Despite having no memory of the visit to his father when he was 3 years old, he fulfilled one of Michael Mallin&#x27;s last requests as written in his pre-execution letter to his family by joining the priesthood. He was the last surviving child of those executed in the Rising until his death in Hong Kong on 1 April 2018 at the age of 104.

<text>Joseph Ward Moore (August 10, 1903 – January 29, 1978) was an American science fiction writer. According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;he contributed only infrequently to the field, [but] each of his books became something of a classic.&quot;

==Writer== 
Moore began publishing with the novel &quot;Breathe the Air Again&quot; (1942), about the onset of the Great Depression. The story is told from multiple viewpoints, and Ward Moore himself appears briefly as a character in the novel.

His most famous work is the alternate history novel &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot; (1953). This novel, narrated by Hodge Backmaker, tells of a world in which the South won the American Civil War, leaving the North in ruins.

Moore&#x27;s other novels include &quot;Cloud by Day&quot;, in which a brush fire threatens a town in Topanga Canyon; 
&quot;Greener Than You Think&quot;, a novel about unstoppable Bermuda grass; 
&quot;Joyleg&quot; (co-authored with Avram Davidson), which assumes the survival of the State of Franklin; and
&quot;Caduceus Wild&quot; (co-authored with Robert Bradford), about a medarchy, a nation governed by physicians.

Moore is also known for the two short stories (since collected) &quot;Lot&quot; (1953) and &quot;Lot&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1954), which are postapocalyptic tales with parallels to the Bible. His short story &quot;Adjustment&quot;, in which an ordinary man adjusts to a never-never land in which his wishes are fulfilled and makes the environment adjust to him as well, has been reprinted several times.
Another postapocalyptic story is Moore&#x27;s 1951 story &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;, which uses the myth of the Flying Dutchman - a legendary ship supposed to be doomed to forever wander the oceans and never reach port - as a metaphor for an automated bomber which continues to fly over an Earth where humanity long since totally destroyed itself and all life in a nuclear war.

==Biography==

Moore was born in Madison, New Jersey, a western suburb of New York City. His parents were Jewish and had married in 1902, the previous year. His grandfather Joseph Solomon Moore (1821–1892) had been a successful German-born commission merchant and the statistician of the New York custom house, the author of several books on the tariff question and a friend of Carl Schurz. Five months after Ward Moore&#x27;s birth, he moved with his parents to Montreal, where his mother&#x27;s family lived. In 1913, they returned to New York.

Moore&#x27;s parents divorced and remarried around this time, and his father died in 1916. His mother&#x27;s second husband and Moore&#x27;s stepfather was the noted German jazz band leader . Moore attended De Witt Clinton High School in New York, where—according to one widely repeated story—he was expelled for antiwar activity during World War I; elsewhere, he claimed that he dropped out of school in order to write. He later attended Columbia College.

Moore claimed to have spent several years tramping around the United States as a hobo during the early 1920s. In the mid-1920s, he managed a bookshop in Chicago, where he befriended one of the store&#x27;s patrons, the young poet Kenneth Rexroth. Moore appears in Rexroth&#x27;s memoir &quot;An Autobiographical Novel&quot; as the mad bohemian poet/bookseller/science fiction writer &quot;Bard Major&quot;. Rexroth claimed that &quot;Major&quot; had been on the Central Committee of the Communist Party in Milwaukee and was expelled for Trotskyist deviationism, but the factual basis for this tale, if any, is obscure.

In 1929, Moore relocated to California, where he was to live for the rest of his life. Starting in 1937, he participated in the Federal Writers Project of the WPA, where his friend Rexroth was an administrator in the San Francisco office. His picaresque first novel &quot;Breathe the Air Again&quot; was about the labor struggle in California during the 1920s. It had autobiographical elements and was widely and favorably reviewed. It was intended to be the first of a trilogy, but the remaining volumes were never published.

In the 1940 census, Moore is listed as living on Clifford Street in Los Angeles with his first wife, Violka. His occupation is listed as writer-novelist in the magazine publishing industry.

During the 1940s, Moore wrote book reviews, articles and short stories for a number of magazines and newspapers, including &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Jewish Horizons&quot;, and &quot;The Nation&quot;. On May 3, 1943, in Los Angeles Moore was married to his second wife, Lorna Lenzi. He had seven children. Starting in 1950, he was book review editor of &quot;Frontier&quot;, a West Coast political monthly similar in outlook to &quot;The Nation&quot;.

In the early 1950s, he began writing regularly for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. He was a friend of the magazine&#x27;s California-based editors, Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas, and soon became a popular favorite with the magazine&#x27;s readers. Though he was never terribly prolific, his science fiction stories penned during the 1950s were entertaining and well crafted and were well received.

In the 1960s, his literary output diminished, and his last two novels were completed with the help of collaborators. His 1953 speculative &quot;If the South had won the Civil War&quot; novel &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot; was brought back into print at the time of the Civil War centennial and found an appreciative new audience among Civil War buffs.

He published little during the 1960s, but published several stories in the mid-1970s.

After separating in June 1963, Moore and Lorna Lenzi were divorced on May 18, 1967. Moore&#x27;s third wife was the science fiction writer Raylyn Moore (née Crabbe; 1928–2005). The couple moved to Pacific Grove, California, where he died in 1978.

<text>Keith John Kingston Roberts (20 September 1935 – 5 October 2000) was an English science fiction author. He began publishing with two stories in the September 1964 issue of &quot;Science Fantasy&quot; magazine, &quot;Anita&quot; (the first of a series of stories featuring a teenage modern witch and her eccentric granny) and &quot;Escapism&quot;.

Several of his early stories were written using the pseudonyms Alistair Bevan and David Stringer. His second novel &quot;Pavane&quot;, first published in 1968, which is a collection of linked stories, may be his most famous work: an alternate history novel in which the Catholic Church takes control of England following the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I.

Roberts wrote numerous novels and short stories and worked as an illustrator. His artistic contributions include covers and interior artwork for &quot;New Worlds&quot; and &quot;Science Fantasy&quot;, later renamed &quot;Impulse&quot;. He also edited the last few issues of &quot;Impulse&quot; although the nominal editor was Harry Harrison.

Roberts&#x27; first novel, &quot;The Furies&quot;, makes an appearance in the American TV series &quot;Bones&quot; in the third season&#x27;s third episode &quot;Death in the Saddle&quot; (9 October 2007).

Roberts described himself as a political conservative and 
an anti-communist.

In later life, Roberts lived in Salisbury. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1990, and died of its complications in October 2000. Obituaries recalled him as a talented but personally &quot;difficult&quot; author, with a history of disputes with publishers, editors and colleagues.

<doc id="571886" wikidata="Q675128" url="?curid=571886" title="Ferranti Mark 1">
<text>The Ferranti Mark 1, also known as the Manchester Electronic Computer in its sales literature, and thus sometimes called the Manchester Ferranti, was produced by British electrical engineering firm Ferranti Ltd. It was the world&#x27;s first commercially available electronic general-purpose stored program digital computer.

Although preceded as a commercial digital computer by the BINAC and the Z4, the Z4 was electromechanical and lacked software programmability, while BINAC never operated successfully after delivery.

The Ferranti Mark 1 was &quot;the tidied up and commercialised version of the Manchester Mark I&quot;. The first machine was delivered to the Victoria University of Manchester in February 1951 (publicly demonstrated in July) ahead of the UNIVAC I which was delivered to the United States Census Bureau in late December 1952, having been sold on 31 March 1951.

==History and specifications==

Based on the Manchester Mark 1, which was designed at the University of Manchester by Freddie Williams and Tom Kilburn, the machine was built by Ferranti of the United Kingdom. The main improvements over it were in the size of the primary and secondary storage, a faster multiplier, and additional instructions.

The Mark 1 used a 20-bit word stored as a single line of dots of electric charges settled on the surface of a Williams tube display, each cathodic tube storing 64 lines of dots. Instructions were stored in a single word, while numbers were stored in two words. The main memory consisted of eight tubes, each storing one such page of 64 words. Other tubes stored the single 80-bit accumulator (A), the 40-bit &quot;multiplicand/quotient register&quot; (MQ) and eight &quot;B-lines&quot;, or index registers, which was one of the unique features of the Mark 1 design. The accumulator could also be addressed as two 40-bit words. An extra 20-bit word per tube stored an offset value into the secondary storage. Secondary storage was provided in the form of a 512-page magnetic drum, storing two pages per track, with about 30 milliseconds revolution time. The drum provided eight times the storage of the original designed at Manchester.

The instructions, like the Manchester machine, used a single-address format in which operands were modified and left in the accumulator. There were about fifty instructions in total. The basic cycle time was 1.2 milliseconds, and a multiplication could be completed in the new parallel unit in about 2.16 milliseconds (about 5 times faster than the original). The multiplier used almost a quarter of the machine&#x27;s 4,050 vacuum tubes. Several instructions were included to copy a word of memory from one of the Williams tubes to a paper tape machine, or read them back in. Several new instructions were added to the original Manchester design, including a random number instruction and several new instructions using the B-lines.

The original Mark 1 had to be programmed by entering alphanumeric characters representing a five-bit value that could be represented on the paper tape input. The engineers decided to use the simplest mapping between the paper holes and the binary digits they represented, but the mapping between the holes and the physical keyboard was never meant to be a binary mapping. As a result, the characters representing the values from 0–31 (five-bit numbers) looked entirely random, specifically codice_1.

The first machine was delivered to the University of Manchester. Ferranti had high hopes for further sales, and were encouraged by an order placed by the Atomic Energy Research Establishment for delivery in autumn 1952. However, a change of government while the second machine was being built led to all government contracts over £100,000 being cancelled, leaving Ferranti with a partially completed Mark 1. The company ultimately sold it to the University of Toronto, who had been building their own machine, but saw the chance to buy the complete Mark 1 for even less. They purchased it for around $30,000, a &quot;fire sale&quot; price, and Beatrice Worsley gave it the nickname FERUT. FERUT was extensively used in business, engineering, and academia, among other duties, carrying out calculations as part of the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway.

Alan Turing wrote a programming manual.

==Mark 1 Star==

After the first two machines, a revised version of the design became available, known as the Ferranti Mark 1 Star or the Ferranti Mark 1*. The revisions mainly cleaned up the instruction set for better usability. Instead of the original mapping from holes to binary digits that resulted in the random-looking mapping, the new machines mapped digits to holes to produce a much simpler mapping, codice_2. Additionally, several commands that used the index registers had side effects that led to quirky programming, but these were modified to have no side effects. The original machines&#x27; codice_3 instructions landed at a location &quot;one before&quot; the actual address, for reasons similar to the odd index behaviour, but these proved useful only in theory and quite annoying in practice, and were similarly modified. Input/output was also modified, with five-bit numbers being output least significant digit to the &quot;right&quot;, as is typical for most numeric writing. These, among other changes, greatly improved the ease of programming the newer machines.

The Mark 1/1* weighed .

At least seven of the Mark 1* machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam. Another was installed at Avro, the aircraft manufacturers, at their Chadderton factory in Manchester. This was used for work on the Vulcan among other projects.

Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods, the parents of Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, both worked on the Ferranti Mark 1 and Mark 1*.

==Computer music==

Included in the Ferranti Mark 1&#x27;s instruction set was a &quot;hoot&quot; command, which enabled the machine to give auditory feedback to its operators. The sound generated could be altered in pitch, a feature which was exploited when the Mark 1 made the earliest known recording of computer-generated music, playing a medley which included &quot;God Save the King&quot;, &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;, and &quot;In the Mood&quot;. The recording was made by the BBC towards the end of 1951, with the programming being done by Christopher Strachey, a mathematics teacher at Harrow and a friend of Alan Turing. It was not, however, the first computer to have played music; CSIRAC, Australia&#x27;s first digital computer, achieved that with a rendition of &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot;.

==Computer games==

In November 1951, Dr. Dietrich Prinz wrote one of the earliest computer games, a chess-playing program for the Manchester Ferranti Mark 1 computer. The limitation of the Mark 1 computer did not allow for a whole game of chess to be programmed. Prinz could only program mate-in-two chess problems. The program examined every possible move for White and Black (thousands of possible moves) until a solution was found, which took 15–20 minutes for easy problems but several hours in general. The program&#x27;s restrictions were: no castling, no double pawn move, no en passant capture, no pawn promotion, nevertheless it distincted between checkmate and stalemate.

<text>Nathaniel Schachner (January 16, 1895 – October 2, 1955), who published under the names Nat Schachner and Nathan Schachner, was an American writer, historian, and attorney, as well as an early advocate of the development of rockets for space travel. A prominent author of historical works on figures from America&#x27;s Revolutionary Era, Schachner also was a regular contributor to the genre leading up to and during the early years of what came to be referred to as the Golden Age of Science Fiction (c. 1938–1946).

Best known for his biographies of American historical figures such as Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, and as the creator of the Grandfather paradox, Schachner began his writing career contributing short stories to leading &quot;pulp magazines&quot; that specialized in science fiction, horror, mystery, and adventure genres. During the heart of the Great Depression, he contributed more than fifty stories to magazines such as &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, &quot;Terror Tales&quot;, &quot;Horror Stories&quot;, &quot;Dime Mystery Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;. He then turned to writing historical non-fiction and fiction, gaining recognition for his prodigious research. 

Schachner, a practicing attorney, was a founder and officer of the American Interplanetary Society, which pioneered liquid fuel rocketry in the United States in the early 1930s. Later known as the American Rocket Society, the organization eventually became part of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, a professional society in the field of aerospace engineering that today has nearly 30,000 members world-wide.

<text>John Edward Daly (25 February 1891 – 4 May 1916; ) was commandant of Dublin&#x27;s 1st battalion of the Irish Volunteers during the Easter Rising of 1916. He was the youngest man to hold that rank and the youngest executed in the aftermath.

==Background==
Ned Daly was born at 26 Frederick Street (now O&#x27;Curry street), Limerick, on 25 February 1891, the only son of ten children born to Edward and Catherine Daly (née O&#x27;Mara). He was the younger brother of Kathleen Clarke, wife of Tom Clarke, and an active member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). His father, Edward, was a Fenian (IRB member) who died aged 41 five months before his son&#x27;s birth. His uncle was John Daly, a prominent republican who had taken part in the Fenian Rising and Fenian Dynamite Campaign.

He was educated by the Presentation Sisters at Sexton Street, the Congregation of Christian Brothers at Roxboro Road and at Leamy’s commercial college. He spent a short time as an apprentice baker in Glasgow before returning to Limerick to work in Spaight&#x27;s timber yard. In 1913 he moved to Dublin, where he lived with the Clarkes and worked in a chemist&#x27;s shop.

==Political involvement==
Although Daly&#x27;s membership of the IRB is certain, it is not known when he joined the organisation. In November 1913 Daly joined the newly founded Irish Volunteers. He soon reached the rank of captain. He was assiduous in his study of military manuals and the professionalism of his company gained the admiration of senior officers in actions such as the Howth gun-running of 1914. In March 1915, he was promoted to the rank of commandant of the 1st Battalion. Like many other of the rising&#x27;s leaders Daly was a member of the Keating branch of the Gaelic League.

==The Easter Rising==
Daly commanded the First battalion, stationed in the Four Courts and areas to the west and north of the centre of Dublin, saw harsh fighting during the rising. He was forced to surrender his battalion on 29 April by Patrick Pearse. Daly was court martialled under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 and executed by firing squad on 4 May 1916, at the age of 25.
==Legacy==
Bray railway station in County Wicklow was renamed Bray Daly railway station in his honour in 1966.

<text>Chexbres ( ) is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Vaud, located in the district of Lavaux-Oron. Chexbres is a wine-growing village and enjoys a good selection of local vintages. It also enjoys notable views of Lake Geneva, and therefore is nicknamed &quot;Balcon du Léman&quot; in French.

==History==

The municipality of Chexbres was already inhabited in Roman times, and a single wall remains and coins have been found. The first written mention of the place appeared in 1139 under the name &quot;Chexbres&quot;. In the ensuing period many other names: Chibriacum (1100), Chabris (1134), Chabre (1142), Cabarissa (1145), Cerbre (1147), Chebra (1165), Chabrii (1179), Chabre (1221), Chaibri (1248), Chaibry (1368), Chebry (1453), Cheibri (1454) and even to 1562, both Chaybres and Cheybres appeared. The origin of the name is not clearly understood. It could be derived from the Roman personal names Cabrius, from the Gallic words Caebre (meaning city on a hill) or from Cabus (hemp).

The area around Chexbres was owned from the 6th century by the abbey of Saint Maurice and in 978 came under the Kingdom of Burgundy. In 1079 King Henry IV gave the village and lands to the bishop of Lausanne.

With the conquest of Vaud by Bern in 1536, Chexbres came under the administration of the Bailiwick of Lausanne. After the collapse of the ancien régime, the village belonged from 1798 to 1803 during the Helvetic Republic to the Canton of Léman, and later the Canton of Vaud. In 1798 the village was assigned to the district of Lavaux and until 1810 was part of the greater community of Saint-Saphorin within this district. It was only after 1810 that it became a politically independent municipality. Thanks to its scenic location, the village developed during the 19th century into a resort.

<text>Tencent QQ (), also known as QQ, is an instant messaging software service and web portal developed by the Mainland Chinese technology company Tencent. QQ offers services that provide online social games, music, shopping, microblogging, movies, and group and voice chat software. As of March 2023, there were 597 million monthly active QQ accounts.

==History==
Tencent QQ was first released in China in February 1999 under the name of OICQ (&quot;Open ICQ&quot;, a reference to the early IM service ICQ).

After the threat of a trademark infringement lawsuit by the AOL-owned ICQ, the product&#x27;s name was changed to QQ (with &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;QQ&quot; used to imply &quot;cute&quot;). The software inherited existing functions from ICQ, and additional features such as software skins, people&#x27;s images, and emoticons. QQ was first released as a &quot;network paging&quot; real-time communications service. Other features were later added, such as chatrooms, games, personal avatars (similar to &quot;Meego&quot; in MSN), online storage, and Internet dating services.

The official client runs on Microsoft Windows and a beta public version was launched for Mac OS X version 10.4.9 or newer. Formerly, two web versions, WebQQ (full version) and WebQQ Mini (Lite version), which made use of Ajax, were available. Development, support, and availability of WebQQ Mini, however, has since been discontinued. On 31 July 2008, Tencent released an official client for Linux, but this has not been made compatible with the Windows version and it is not capable of voice calls..

In response to competition with other instant messengers, such as Windows Live Messenger, Tencent released Tencent Messenger, which is aimed at businesses.

===Membership===
In 2002, Tencent stopped its free membership registration, requiring all new members to pay a fee. In 2003, however, this decision was reversed due to pressure from other instant messaging services such as Windows Live Messenger (WLM) and Sina UC.
Tencent currently offers a premium membership scheme, where premium members enjoy features such as QQ mobile, ringtone downloads, and SMS sending/receiving. In addition, Tencent offers &quot;Diamond&quot; level memberships. Currently, there are seven diamond schemes available:
* Red for the QQ Show service which features some superficial abilities such as having a colored account name.
* Yellow to obtain extra storage and decorations in Qzone—a blog service.
* Blue to obtain special abilities in the game-plays of QQ games.
* Purple for obtaining special abilities in games including QQ Speed, QQ Nana, and QQ Tang
* Pink for having different boosts in the pet-raising game called QQ Pet.
* Green for using QQ music—a service for users to stream music online. 
* VIP for having extra features in the chat client such as removing advertisements
* Black for gaining benefits related to DNF (Dungeon &amp; Fighter), a multiplayer PC beat &#x27;em up video game.

==QQ Coin==
The QQ Coin is a virtual currency used by QQ users to &quot;purchase&quot; QQ related items for their avatar and blog. QQ Coins are obtained either by purchase (one coin for one RMB) or by using the mobile phone service. Due to the popularity of QQ among young people in China, QQ Coins are accepted by online vendors in exchange for &quot;real&quot; merchandise such as small gifts. This has raised concerns of replacing (and thus &quot;inflating&quot;) real currency in these transactions.

The People&#x27;s Bank of China, China&#x27;s central bank, tried to crack down on QQ Coins due to people using QQ Coins in exchange for real world goods. However, this only caused the value of QQ coins to rise as more and more third-party vendors started to accept them. Tencent claims the QQ Coin is a mere regular commodity, and is, therefore, not a currency.

== Q Zone ==

Qzone is a social networking website based in China which was created by Tencent in 2005. Q Zone is a personal blog for QQ users. It can be set as a public page or a private friend-only page. Users can upload diaries and share photos.

==QQ International==

=== Windows ===

In 2009, QQ began to expand its services internationally with its QQ International client for Windows distributed through a dedicated English-language portal.

QQ International offers non-Mandarin speakers the opportunity to use most of the features of its Chinese counterpart to get in touch with other QQ users via chat, VoIP, and video calls, and it provides a non-Mandarin interface to access Qzone, Tencent&#x27;s social network. The client supports English, French, Spanish, German, Korean, Japanese and Traditional Chinese.

One of the main features of QQ International is the optional and automatic machine translation in all chats.

=== Android ===

An Android version of QQ International was released in September of 2013. The client&#x27;s interface is in English, French, Spanish, German, Korean, Japanese and Traditional Chinese. In addition to text messaging, users can send each other images, videos, and audio media messages. Moreover, users can share multimedia content with all contacts through the client&#x27;s Qzone interface.

The live translation feature is available for all incoming messages and supports up to 18 languages.

=== iOS ===

QQ International for iPhone and iOS devices was released at the end of 2013, fully equivalent to its Android counterpart.

=== Partnerships ===

In India, Tencent has partnered with ibibo to bring services such as chat, mail and game to the developing Indian internet sphere.

In Vietnam, Tencent has struck a deal with VinaGame to bring the QQ Casual Gaming portal as well as the QQ Messenger as an addition to the already thriving Vietnamese gaming communities.

In the United States, Tencent has partnered with AOL to bring QQ Games as a contender in the US social gaming market. Launched in 2007, QQ Games came bundled with the AIM installer, and competed with AOL&#x27;s own games.com to provide a gaming experience for the AIM user base.

==Web QQ==
Tencent launched its web-based QQ formally on 15 September 2009, the latest version of which being 3.0. Rather than solely a web-based IM, WebQQ 3.0 functions more like its own operating system, with a desktop in which web applications can be added.

===Social network website===
In 2009, Tencent launched Xiaoyou (校友, &#x27;schoolmate&#x27;), its first social network website. In mid-2010, Tencent changed direction and replaced Xiaoyou with Pengyou (朋友, &#x27;friends&#x27;), trying to establish a more widespread network, to which extant QQ users could be easily redirected, hence giving Pengyou a major advantage over its competitors. Tencent&#x27;s social network Qzone is linked to in the International and native versions of QQ.

==Open source and cross-platform clients==
Using reverse engineering, open source communities have come to understand the QQ protocol better and have attempted to implement client core libraries compatible with more user-friendly clients, free of advertisements. Most of these clients are cross-platform, so they are usable on operating systems which the official client does not support. However, these implementations had only a subset of functions of the official client and therefore were limited in features. Furthermore, QQ&#x27;s parent company, Tencent, has over successive versions modified the QQ protocol to the extent that it can no longer be supported by most, and perhaps any, of the third-party implementations that were successful in the past (some of which are listed below). As of 2009, none of the developers of third-party clients have publicized any plans to restore QQ support.

* Pidgin, also known as: GAIM an open source cross-platform multiprotocol client, with third-party plugin.
* Adium, an open source macOS client, with third-party plugin built on top of libqq-pidgin
* Kopete, an open source multiprotocol client by KDE
** Note: Kopete, old versions of Pidgin, and any other client whose QQ support was based on libpurple no longer supports QQ as of May 2011
* Miranda NG, an open source multiprotocol client, designed for Microsoft Windows, with MirandaQQ2 plugin.
* Eva
*Trillian, is a Multiprotocol Instant Messaging Software made as Freeware Developed by Cerulean Studios which ran off Plugins to connect to things such as: AIM, ICQ, Yahoo Messenger, MSN Messenger and XMPP/Jabber.

==Merchandise==
Tencent has taken advantage of the popularity of the QQ brand and has set up many Q-Gen stores selling QQ branded merchandise such as bags, watches, clothing as well as toy penguins.

==Related characteristics==
* The accounts of QQ are purely a combination of numbers. The account numbers provided for the registered users are selected randomly by the system user registration. In 1995, the registered QQ accounts had only 5 digits, while currently, the digital numbers used for QQ accounts has reached 12. The first QQ number is held by Ma Huateng and his account number is 10001.
* Membership to a QQ account usually lasts one month. When this membership is overdue and not renewed, the membership of the account will be suspended.
* In relation to calculating &quot;QQ Age&quot;, being logged in for 2 full hours would be considered as one full day. Thus, being logged in to QQ for around 700 hours would make the age increase by 1 year. In the 2012 version of QQ, users can see the age on the personal information page.
* In 2004, Tencent launched QQ hierarchy which shows the level of a registered member. At the very beginning, this hierarchy was solely based on the hours a member spent in QQ. Hence, the longer the member stayed, the higher level they can attain. These results, however, were criticized as people tend to waste electrical energy due to longer hours of stay on the site. Therefore, Tencent changed the basis from an hour unit to a daily unit due to the involvement of several departments.

==Controversies and criticisms==

===Coral QQ===

Coral QQ, a modification of Tencent QQ, is another add-on for the software, providing free access to some of the services and blocking Tencent&#x27;s advertisements. In 2006, Tencent filed a copyright lawsuit against Chen Shoufu (aka Soft), the author of Coral QQ, after his distribution of a modified Tencent QQ was ruled illegal. Chen then published his modification as a separate add-on. On 16 August 2007, Chen was detained again for allegedly making profits off of his ad-blocking add-on. The case resulted in a three-year prison sentence for Shoufu.

===Dispute with Qihoo 360===

In 2010, Chinese anti-virus company, Qihoo 360, analyzed the QQ protocol and accused QQ of automatically scanning users&#x27; computers and uploading their personal information to QQ&#x27;s servers without the users&#x27; consent. In response, Tencent called 360 a malware and denied users of installing 360 access to some of the QQ&#x27;s services. The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information reprimanded both companies for &quot;improper competition&quot; and ordered them to come to an agreement.

===Government surveillance===
Some observers have criticized QQ&#x27;s compliance in the Chinese government&#x27;s Internet surveillance and censorship. A 2013 report by Reporters Without Borders specifically mentioned QQ as allowing authorities to monitor online conversations for keywords or phrases and track participants by their user number.

===Adware controversy===
The Chinese version of QQ makes use of embedded advertisements. Older versions of the client have been branded as malicious adware by some antivirus and anti-spyware vendors.

Both the Chinese and International versions of QQ had been tested in 2013. Currently it is identified as malware by DrWeb, Zillya, NANO-Antivirus, and VBA32 give positive results, most of which identify it as a trojan.

==Security==

On March 6, 2015, QQ scored 2 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#x27;s secure messaging scorecard. It received points for having communications encrypted in transit and for having a recent independent security audit. It lost points because communications are not end-to-end encrypted, users can not verify contacts&#x27; identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen (i.e. the service does not provide forward secrecy), the code is not open to independent review (i.e. the code is not open-source), and the security design is not properly documented.
