<text>Lake Mead National Recreation Area is a U.S. national recreation area in Southeastern Nevada and Northwestern Arizona. Operated by the National Park Service, Lake Mead NRA follows the Colorado River corridor from the westernmost boundary of Grand Canyon National Park to just north of the cities of Laughlin, Nevada and Bullhead City, Arizona. It includes all of the eponymous Lake Mead as well as the smaller Lake Mohave – reservoirs on the river created by Hoover Dam and Davis Dam, respectively – and the surrounding desert terrain and wilderness.

Formation of Lake Mead began in 1935, less than a year before Hoover Dam was completed. The area surrounding Lake Mead was protected as a bird refuge in 1933 and later established as the Boulder Dam Recreation Area in 1936 and the name was changed to Lake Mead National Recreation Area in 1947. In 1964, the area was expanded to include Lake Mohave and its surrounding area and became the first National Recreation Area to be designated as such by the U.S. Congress.

== Amenities ==
Lake Mead NRA features water recreation, including boating, swimming, and fishing, on both lakes as well as the stretches of river between the lakes. It also features hiking trails and views of the surrounding desert landscape. Three of the four desert ecosystems found in the United States — the Mojave Desert, the Great Basin Desert, and the Sonoran Desert — meet in Lake Mead NRA. Tours of Hoover Dam – administered by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation – are also a major attraction within the recreation area.

About of the recreation area are managed separately under the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, established in 2000. Water covers about of the recreation area.

== Recreation ==
Lake Mead NRA offers diverse recreational activities, drawing visitors from across the country. The area spans over 1.5 million acres of desert landscapes, two reservoirs (Lake Mead and Lake Mohave), and unique geological features.

The recreation area provides premier destinations for boating, fishing, kayaking, and swimming, supported by over 750 miles of shoreline. Boating facilities, including marinas, boat ramps, and houseboat rentals, enhance the visitor experience. Fishing opportunities abound, with species like striped bass, catfish, and crappie commonly caught in the lakes.

With over of trails, Lake Mead NRA caters to hikers of all skill levels. Trails range from scenic lakeside walks to challenging treks, such as the Historic Railroad Trail and Goldstrike Canyon Trail, home to the natural Gold Strike Hot Springs. Campgrounds and backcountry camping sites provide options for overnight stays.

The desert terrain, extreme temperatures, and water-related hazards contribute to its reputation as one of the most dangerous national parks in the United States. From 2007 to 2024, 317 fatalities were reported in the area, with water-related incidents like drowning being the leading cause.

=== Conservation and Visitor Safety ===
The National Park Service (NPS) is dedicated to maintaining safety and preserving the natural and cultural heritage of Lake Mead NRA. Safety programs emphasize the use of life jackets, hydration, and heat preparedness. Visitor centers and interpretive programs provide resources and educational materials to enhance the visitor experience while promoting responsible recreation.

=== Historical Features ===
The ghost town of St. Thomas, Nevada, located within Lake Mead NRA, offers a unique glimpse into the region&#x27;s history. Once submerged under Lake Mead, the town has reemerged as water levels have receded, revealing a 2-mile loop trail with interpretive signage. It is accessed near the Northshore Entrance Station, just south of Overton.

<text>The Florissant Formation is a sedimentary geologic formation outcropping around Florissant, Teller County, Colorado. The formation is noted for the abundant and exceptionally preserved insect and plant fossils that are found in the mudstones and shales. Based on argon radiometric dating, the formation is Eocene (approximately 34 million years old ) in age and has been interpreted as a lake environment. The fossils have been preserved because of the interaction of the volcanic ash from the nearby Thirtynine Mile volcanic field with diatoms in the lake, causing a diatom bloom. As the diatoms fell to the bottom of the lake, any plants or animals that had recently died were preserved by the diatom falls. Fine layers of clays and muds interspersed with layers of ash form &quot;paper shales&quot; holding beautifully-preserved fossils. The Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument is a national monument established to preserve and study the geology and history of the area.

==History==

The name &quot;Florissant&quot; comes from the French word for flowering. In the late 19th century tourist and excavators came to this location to observe the wildlife and collect samples for collections and study. The Petrified Forest, which is one of the main attractions at the monument today, lost much of its mass due to collectors removing large amounts of petrified wood from the site.

During the 1860s and 1870s the area was mapped by geologists for the first time. Geologists of the Hayden Survey visited the area in the early 1870s, and fossil plants from the beds were described by Leo Lesquereux, fossil insects by Samuel Hubbard Scudder, and vertebrate fossils by Edward Drinker Cope. The formation was first formally named as the Florissant Lake Beds by Charles Whitman Cross in 1894.

In 1969, the Florissant Fossil Bed National Monument was established after a long legal battle between local land owners and the federal government. Today, the park receives approximately 60,000 visitors a year, and is the site of ongoing paleontological investigations. The formation itself was renamed the Florissant Formation in 2001 to conform with the requirements of the North American Commission on Stratigraphic Nomenclature.

==Geology==

In the late Eocene to early Oligocene, approximately 34 million years ago, the area was a lake environment with redwood trees. The basement is the Proterozoic aged Pikes Peak Granite. There is an unconformity from the Pikes Peak Granite to the next unit, the Wall Mountain tuff. The massive unconformity is due to erosion that occurred during the uplift of the modern Rocky Mountains, the Laramide Orogeny. The Wall Mountain Tuff was deposited as a result of a large eruption from a distant caldera. The Florissant Formation itself is composed of alternating units of shale, mudstone, conglomerate, and volcanic deposits. There are six described units within the Florissant Formation. In order from bottom to top: the lower shale unit, lower mudstone unit, middle shale unit, caprock conglomerate unit, upper shale unit, and the upper pumice unit. Each of the shale units represents lacustrine environments, composed of very thin shales that are abundant in fossils, which alternate with tuffs from eruptions. The lower mudstone has been interpreted as a stream environment with the top of the unit being a lahar deposit. The mudstones were deposited on a valley floor, but not in a lake. The separation of the shale units by non-lake deposits could mean that there were two generations of lake deposits. Lahars that went through the valley could have dammed up the valley, allowing for the creation of a lake. The middle and upper shale units were then deposited in this second generation of the lake. The caprock conglomerate was deposited as a large lahar went through the valley and accumulated down on the lake floor.

The Laramide Orogeny, which created the modern Rocky Mountains, had been uplifting the area to the west since the end of the Cretaceous, although the exact timing of the orogeny is debated In the late Eocene to the Early Oligocene, volcanic episodes began to occur to the southwest of the Florissant area. These episodes of eruption would deposit ash and other volcanic debris on the Florissant location, and the volcanic material would be one of the most important factors in the fossilization of the plants and animals that are so abundant in the formation. The fossil bearing paper shales are intercalated with larger deposits of volcanic material.

Most of the rocks that were deposited after the Oligocene and before the Pleistocene have been eroded away. Most of the remaining units are composed of clasts of weathered Pikes Peak Granite, volcanics, and mud that were transported by streams that flowed through the area. Some mammoth bones have been found within these units and have been dated to around 50,000 years old.

===Thirtynine Mile Volcanic Field===

Around 25–30 kilometers to the southwest, a series of stratovolcanoes, similar to modern day volcanoes like Mt. St Helens, developed and erupted periodically. Called the Guffey volcanic center, within the larger Thirtynine Mile volcanic field, the volcano had eruptions that included domes, lava flows, and pyroclastic events. Ash from these events settled throughout the area and lahars flowed down the valleys. The ash that settled created the tuff, and the lahars formed the mudstones and the conglomerates of the Florissant formation.

The Florissant was deposited in a paleovalley after one of the lahars dammed it up. The resulting lake became as large as 36 km2. There were two cycles of lake environments. The first one created the lower shale unit, while the second lake created the middle and upper shale units.
Eventually, the volcanoes became dormant and started to erode away. Over time, the volcanoes became so eroded that there are no more obvious signs of them on the surface. Instead, the Eocene erosional surface is the only remnant of the area&#x27;s volcanoes.

==Fossils==
The volcanic material that caused so much destruction led to the preservation of the fossils within the Florissant Formation&#x27;s shales and mudstones. As the ash was deposited on the landscape, it was carried by water through streams and lahars to the lake. The lahars then covered the base of the redwoods that were living at the time, and the trunks of the trees became harder and fossilized. Through permineralization, the precipitates that were in the ground water flowed through the tree trunks, replacing the original matter with siliceous minerals, replacing the organic matter with silica. This process of mineralization led to the preservation of the stumps of the trees.

Within the lake itself, the volcanic deposits were periodically deposited into the lake either through direct deposition or though weathering. The volcanic material was rich in silica. Living in the lake at the time were diatoms, whose shells were also composed of silica. The influx of more silica caused the diatoms to bloom in the lake. As the population of the diatoms massively increased, the stress from the volcanic episodes at the same time caused large die-offs of the local biota. As the plants and animals died off, their leaves and bodies fell into the lake and eventually large amounts of organic matter accumulated at the bottom of the lake. This process was repeated often, possibly yearly, as the runoff from rain collected in the lake, causing cyclical diatom blooms and die-offs. The diatom blooms and die-offs created layers of ash-clay deposits, called couplets, resulting in many thin layers. Each microlayer of ash and clay was compacted by overlaying sediments to create &quot;paper shales&quot; (usually between 0.1 and 1.0 mm thick). Within these paper shales the best preserved fossils can be found in the formation. Based on this information, it has been estimated that the lake could have lasted 2,500 to 5,000 years, if the diatom couplets represent annual cycles.

===Paleoflora===
There is a large diversity of plants in the beds of the Florissant Formation, ranging from large redwoods to microscopic pollen. The petrified forest is one of the main tourist attractions at the monument with an estimated 30 preserved stumps. They are among the largest petrified stumps in the world. The majority of the stumps have been identified as belonging to &quot;Sequoia affinis&quot;, a close relative of the modern coast redwood (&quot;S. sempervirens&quot;). These trees could have been as tall as until they were killed by lahars suffocating the oxygen supply to their roots. Dendrochronological examination of the tree rings has resulted in estimated ages of 500–700 years old when the trees were killed and buried. Some of the stumps belong to angiosperms.
The Florissant Formation is also known for its fossilized leaves and the impressions they made. There are also specimens of fruits, seeds, cones, and flowers, which are all preserved in the paper shales of the formation. Most of the leaves come from trees and shrubs. Angiosperms are the dominant paleoflora, but there are also conifers present.

Some of the cones, foliage, and pollen have been identified as coming from the sequoias. There are distinct differences in the fossilized &quot;Sequoia affinis&quot; material to the modern redwoods of California. The foliage in the fossils is thinner and the female cones are smaller than the modern examples.
There have been more than 130 species of pollen that have been identified in the shale beds at Florissant. These species represent samples from many different habitats that were located near and around the lake, as well as farther up the valley.

Benthic diatoms are the dominant type of siliceous algae found in the beds. These are easy to fossilize due to their silica shells. During periods of volcanism, the influxes of silica from volcanic ash lead to blooms of algae, which lead to algal mats and the exceptional preservation of the fossils. Florissant is significant in that it is one of the earliest known examples of freshwater diatoms.

===Fauna===
The majority of the animal fossils found at Florissant are invertebrates, but many specimens of vertebrates have been found. With such a large number of species identified in this location, it becomes apparent that the environment was ideal for a large range of animals to survive in the area. The great preservation of these animals gives insight into the environment that they survived in, as well as some aspects of their behavior.

====Invertebrates====
The invertebrate fossils of the Florissant are arthropods, such as spiders, millipedes, insects, and ostracods; and mollusks such as clams and snails. Of these, the most significant seem to be the spiders and insects, of which over 1,500 species have been identified in the fossil beds.

Arachnids are well represented in the Florissant, mostly a large variety of spiders. There have also been possible examples of harvestmen and daddy long-legs. There may be some evidence for gall mites, but no fully identified body fossils of them have been discovered yet. One unusual aspect of the spiders found in the formation is that they are not found with their legs curled in, but instead they are fully extended. This could indicate that they died in warmer temperature or acidic waters.
The insects that are found in the ash-clay beds are diverse and numerous. Mayflies, dragonflies, damselflies, grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, cockroaches, termites, earwigs, web-spinners, cicadas, snake flies, lacewings, beetles, flies, mosquitoes, butterflies, moths, wasps, bees, ants, and other insects have all been found in the Florissant. Of these, the beetles are the most diverse and dominate in number of specimens found as fossils. About 38% of the specimens found in the fossil beds are varieties of beetle. These fossils are aquatic and terrestrial insects, giving insight into the ecology and biology of the area.

Ostracods are believed to have fed on algae on the bottom of the lake. Most of the fossil examples of ostracod come from the preserved carapaces, or feeding appendages. Only one species of ostracods has been described so far. Several freshwater mollusks have been identified, including freshwater and terrestrial. The most abundant mollusk that has been identified at Florissant is gastropods (snails).

====Vertebrates====
The vertebrate fossils in the Florissant are predominantly small fragments of incomplete bones. There have been a few described species of vertebrates, mostly fish, but also birds and mammals.
The fish discovered at the site include bowfins, suckers, catfishes, and pirate perches. Most of these were bottom dwellers, except the perches, and many were tolerant of poor water conditions. Most of the fish have been found in the same shale layers versus other shale layers. This could indicate that there were more tolerable times for fish populations over the history of the lake than other times.

Three examples of birds have been found in the beds, including a cuckoo. Most of the skeleton was lost, but there were still enough diagnostic features to identify the bird. There are also examples of rollers and shorebirds. Other birds were described in early literature from the 19th century, but the exact identification of these samples cannot be done due to lack of information.

Mammals are almost non-existent in the shales, with only one specimen of a small opossum being discovered so far. In the lower mudstone units, there are samples of broken bones of a horse, a brontothere, and an oreodont. The horse would have been small, about as large as a medium-sized dog, with three toes on each foot. All this information is based on a complete lower jaw. The largest mammal that has been discovered so far is a brontothere, an elephant-sized animal with a pair of thick horns on the top of its head. All of this information is based on fragmented vertebrae and small pieces of tooth enamel. The oreodont, is an extinct family that resembles modern sheep and pigs. The only oreodont specimen is a jaw fragment. Other mammals have been described in the formation based on teeth specimens. In all, around a dozen mammalian taxa have been discovered and described in the Florissant.

Surprisingly, no reptiles or amphibians have been recorded from Florissant, where they would have been expected. No explanation for the lack has been proposed, given the nearly 40,000 specimens from this location held by museums. The toxicity of the water due to volcanic activity could be to blame, but there are documented cases of aquatic animals in the lake.

==Paleoclimate==
Fossil plants, and in particular their leaves, have been the most useful sources of information of paleoclimate during the time of deposition of the Florissant Formation. Plants have a smaller tolerance on average to climatic changes, whereas many animals can be mobile and respond to rapid seasonal or daily changes.

Comparing fossil plants and leaves to modern analogs enables inferences about the climate to be made based on physiological and morphological similarities. One of the best ways to do this is by studying the characteristics of the leaves that have been found. By looking at the physiognomy, or analysis of gross appearance based on climatic factors, the mean average temperature (or MAT) has been estimated to be around 13 °C, much warmer than the modern MAT at Florissant of 4 °C. There have also been estimates that the MAT was between 16 and 18 °C, based on comparisons to the closest living relatives of the plants. There are also indications that the seasonal changes in the area were not as great as what is seen in modern times. Estimates of MAT, based on pollen, have put the temperature as high as 17.5 °C, but pollen is arguably less diagnostic than leaves. .

Based on the small size and the features of the teeth, the precipitation during the late Eocene to early Oligocene has been estimated to be around 50-80 centimeters per year, with a distinct dry season. This is much wetter than the average 38 cm that falls in the area during modern times. Most of the precipitation would have come in the late spring to early summer, with the rare snowfall in the winter.

Tree-ring analysis indicates that the environment that the redwoods grew in during the time of sediment deposition would have been even more favorable than the current climate that the redwoods in California grow in. The average ring width, one year of growth, is larger than the width of redwoods in central California.
Towards the end of the Eocene, the global temperature began to decrease. However, this episode of global cooling is not indicated in the fossil record at Florissant.

===Paleohabitats===
The fossilized algae and aquatic angiosperms indicate that the lake was freshwater and shallow. Near the streams and shore, moisture was plentiful, allowing lush vegetation to grow. However, further up the hillsides was more dry-adapted vegetation. At the base of the valley, trees (such as sequoias) dominated the landscape. The understory of this forest would have been composed of smaller trees and shrubs. There would have been a gradual transition between the different habitats from the base of the valley up the hillsides, with some overlap between the two.

Insects from the area indicate different habitats as well. There are exclusively aquatic insects, such as dragonflies, that would have lived their entire lives on or near the lake. Meanwhile, the bees and butterflies would have preferred more open spaces in the surrounding hillsides and meadows.

===Paleoaltitude===
Early estimates of the elevation of the Florissant beds was determined to be between 300 and 900 meters, much lower than the modern elevation of 2,500-2,600 meters. However, more recent estimates that are based on paleoflora have put the elevation in the Eocene much higher. Ranges from 1,900 to 4,100 meters have been proposed. This would indicate that global climate change, rather than tectonic uplift, would be the main cause of changing environments in the area.
The actual elevation of the Florissant area during the Eocene is still being determined. While most of the analysis using paleoflora has the area at a higher elevation than modern times, there is evidence that the elevation was as low as the earlier estimates.

<text>In chemistry, antimonite refers to a salt of antimony(III), such as NaSb(OH)4 and NaSbO2 (meta-antimonite), which can be prepared by reacting alkali with antimony trioxide, Sb2O3. These are formally salts of antimonous acid, Sb(OH)3, whose existence in solution is dubious. Attempts to isolate it generally form Sb2O3·&quot;x&quot;H2O, antimony(III) oxide hydrate, which slowly transforms into Sb2O3.

In geology, the mineral stibnite, Sb2S3, is sometimes called antimonite.

Antimonites can be compared to antimonates, which contain antimony in the +5 oxidation state.

<doc id="565010" wikidata="Q407861" url="?curid=565010" title="Chalcanthite">
<text>Chalcanthite (, ) is a richly colored blue-green water-soluble sulfate mineral . It is commonly found in the late-stage oxidation zones of copper deposits. Due to its ready solubility, chalcanthite is more common in arid regions.

Chalcanthite is a pentahydrate and the most common member of a group of similar hydrated sulfates, the chalcanthite group. These other sulfates are identical in chemical composition to chalcanthite, with the exception of replacement of the copper ion by either manganese as jokokuite, iron as melanterite, or magnesium as pentahydrite.

Other names include &quot;blue stone&quot;, &quot;blue vitriol&quot;, and &quot;copper vitriol&quot;.

== Uses of chalcanthite ==

As chalcanthite is a copper mineral, it can be used as an ore of copper. However, its ready solubility in water means that it tends to crystallize, dissolve, and recrystallize as crusts over any mine surface in more humid regions. Therefore, chalcanthite is only found in the most arid regions in sufficiently large quantities for use as an ore.

Secondarily, chalcanthite, due to its rich color and beautiful crystals, is a sought after collector&#x27;s mineral. However, as with its viability as an ore, the solubility of the mineral causes significant problems. First, the mineral readily absorbs and releases its water content, which, over time, leads to a disintegration of the crystal structure, destroying even the finest specimens. It is critical to store specimens properly to limit exposure to humidity. Second, higher quality crystals can be easily grown synthetically, and, as such, there is a concern that disreputable mineral dealers would present a sample as natural when it is not.

== Associated minerals ==
Given that chalcanthite is found in oxidized copper deposits, it is frequently found in association with other copper minerals. Frequently associated minerals include:
* Calcite and its polymorph, aragonite, both 
* Brochantite, 
* Chalcopyrite, 
* Malachite, 
* Melanterite, 

== Notes for identification ==

Chalcanthite&#x27;s blue color is one of its most notable features, but it is insufficient in identification. Other useful tests include associated minerals, crystal habit, solubility and subsequent coloring of the water blue. Chalcanthite can also dye materials blue when dissolved in water, and has a peculiarly sweet and metallic taste, although consuming it can induce dangerous copper poisoning.

<text>Particle displacement or displacement amplitude is a measurement of distance of the movement of a sound particle from its equilibrium position in a medium as it transmits a sound wave. 
The SI unit of particle displacement is the metre (m). In most cases this is a longitudinal wave of pressure (such as sound), but it can also be a transverse wave, such as the vibration of a taut string. In the case of a sound wave travelling through air, the particle displacement is evident in the oscillations of air molecules with, and against, the direction in which the sound wave is travelling.

A particle of the medium undergoes displacement according to the particle velocity of the sound wave traveling through the medium, while the sound wave itself moves at the speed of sound, equal to in air at .

==Mathematical definition ==
Particle displacement, denoted δ, is given by
:formula_1
where v is the particle velocity.

==Progressive sine waves==
The particle displacement of a &quot;progressive sine wave&quot; is given by
:formula_2
where
*formula_3 is the amplitude of the particle displacement;
*formula_4 is the phase shift of the particle displacement;
*formula_5 is the angular wavevector;
*formula_6 is the angular frequency.

It follows that the particle velocity and the sound pressure along the direction of propagation of the sound wave &quot;x&quot; are given by
:formula_7
:formula_8
where
*formula_9 is the amplitude of the particle velocity;
*formula_10 is the phase shift of the particle velocity;
*formula_11 is the amplitude of the acoustic pressure;
*formula_12 is the phase shift of the acoustic pressure.

Taking the Laplace transforms of &quot;v&quot; and &quot;p&quot; with respect to time yields
:formula_13
:formula_14

Since formula_15, the amplitude of the specific acoustic impedance is given by
:formula_16

Consequently, the amplitude of the particle displacement is related to those of the particle velocity and the sound pressure by
:formula_17
:formula_18

<doc id="565034" wikidata="Q885621" url="?curid=565034" title="Liquidation">
<text>Liquidation is the process in accounting by which a company is brought to an end. The assets and property of the business are redistributed. When a firm has been liquidated, it is sometimes referred to as wound-up or dissolved, although dissolution technically refers to the last stage of liquidation. The process of liquidation also arises when customs, an authority or agency in a country responsible for collecting and safeguarding customs duties, determines the final computation or ascertainment of the duties or drawback accruing on an entry.

Liquidation may either be compulsory (sometimes referred to as a &quot;creditors&#x27; liquidation&quot; or &quot;receivership&quot; following bankruptcy, which may result in the court creating a &quot;liquidation trust&quot;; or sometimes a court can mandate the appointment of a liquidator e.g. &quot;wind-up order&quot; in Australia) or voluntary (sometimes referred to as a &quot;shareholders&#x27; liquidation&quot; or &quot;members&#x27; liquidation&quot;, although some voluntary liquidations are controlled by the creditors).

The term &quot;liquidation&quot; is also sometimes used informally to describe a company seeking to divest of some of its assets. For instance, a retail chain may wish to close some of its stores. For efficiency&#x27;s sake, it will often sell these at a discount to a company specializing in real estate liquidation instead of becoming involved in an area it may lack sufficient expertise in to operate with maximum profitability. A company may also operate in a &quot;receivership-like&quot; state but calmly sell its assets, for example to prevent its portfolio being written off in the event of an actual compulsory liquidation.

==Compulsory liquidation==
The parties which are entitled by law to petition for the compulsory liquidation of a company vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally, a petition may be lodged with the court for the compulsory liquidation of a company by:

* The company itself
* Any creditor which establishes a &quot;prima facie&quot; case
* Contributories: Those shareholders be required to contribute to the company&#x27;s assets on liquidation
* A government minister, usually the one responsible for competition and business
* An official receiver

===Grounds===
The grounds upon which an entity can apply to the court for an order of compulsory liquidation also vary between jurisdictions, but usually include:

* The company has so resolved
* The company was incorporated as a corporation, and has not been issued with a trading certificate (or equivalent) within 12 months of registration
* It is an &quot;old public company&quot; (i.e. one that has not re-registered as a public company or become a private company under more recent companies legislation requiring this)
* It has not commenced business within the statutorily prescribed time (normally one year) of its incorporation, or has not carried on business for a statutorily prescribed amount of time
* The number of members has fallen below the minimum prescribed by statute
* The company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due
* It is just and equitable to wind up the company, as for an example specified by an insolvency act

In practice, the vast majority of compulsory winding-up applications are made under one of the last two grounds.

An order will not generally be made if the purpose of the application is to enforce payment of a debt which is &quot;bona fide&quot; disputed.

A &quot;just and equitable&quot; winding-up enables the grounds to subject the strict legal rights of the shareholders to equitable considerations. It can take account of personal relationships of mutual trust and confidence in small parties, particularly, for example, where there is a breach of an understanding that all of the members may participate in the business, or of an implied obligation to participate in management. An order might be made where the majority shareholders deprive the minority of their right to appoint and remove their own director.

===The order===
Once liquidation commences (which depends upon applicable law, but will generally be when the petition was originally presented, and not when the court makes the order), dispositions of the company&#x27;s generally void, and litigation involving the company is generally restrained.

Upon hearing the application, the court may either dismiss the petition or make the order for winding-up. The court may dismiss the application if the petitioner unreasonably refrains from an alternative course of action.

The court may appoint an official receiver, and one or more liquidators, and has general powers to enable rights and liabilities of claimants and contributories to be settled. Separate meetings of creditors and contributories may decide to nominate a person for the appointment of a liquidator and possibly of a supervisory liquidation committee.

===Administrative receiver===

The person appointed by the holder of a floating charge debenture over a company&#x27;s assets to collect in and realise the assets of that company and to repay the indebtedness to the debenture holder. Administrative receivers can no longer be appointed by floating charge holders with the exception of floating charges created prior to 15 September 2003.

==Voluntary liquidation==
Voluntary liquidation occurs when the members of a company resolve to voluntarily wind up its affairs and dissolve. Voluntary liquidation begins when the company passes the resolution, and the company will generally cease to carry on business at that time (if it has not done so already). 

A creditors’ voluntary liquidation (CVL) is a process designed to allow an insolvent company to close voluntarily. The decision to liquidate is made by a board resolution, but instigated by the director(s). 75 percent of the company&#x27;s shareholders must agree to liquidate for liquidation proceedings to advance. If a limited company’s liabilities outweigh its assets, or the company cannot pay its bills when they fall due, the company becomes insolvent.

If the company is solvent, and the members have made a statutory declaration of solvency, the liquidation will proceed as a members&#x27; voluntary liquidation (MVL). In that case, the general meeting will appoint the liquidator(s). If not, the liquidation will proceed as a creditors&#x27; voluntary liquidation, and a meeting of creditors will be called, to which the directors must report on the company&#x27;s affairs. Where a voluntary liquidation proceeds as a creditors&#x27; voluntary liquidation, a liquidation committee may be appointed.

Where a voluntary winding-up of a company has begun, a compulsory liquidation order is still possible, but the petitioning contributory would need to satisfy the court that a voluntary liquidation would prejudice the contributors.

==Misconduct==
The liquidator will normally have a duty to ascertain whether any misconduct has been conducted by those in control of the company which has caused prejudice to the general body of creditors. In some legal systems, in appropriate cases, the liquidator may be able to bring an action against errant directors or shadow directors for either wrongful trading or fraudulent trading.

The liquidator may also have to determine whether any payments made by the company or transactions entered into may be voidable as a transaction at an undervalue or an unfair preference.

==Priority of claims==

The main purpose of a liquidation where the company is insolvent is to collect its assets, determine the outstanding claims against the company, and satisfy those claims in the manner and order prescribed by law.

The liquidator must determine the company&#x27;s title to property in its possession. Property which is in the possession of the company, but which was supplied under a valid retention of title clause will generally have to be returned to the supplier. Property which is held by the company on trust for third parties will not form part of the company&#x27;s assets available to pay creditors.

Before the claims are met, secured creditors are entitled to enforce their claims against the assets of the company to the extent that they are subject to a valid security interest. In most legal systems, only fixed security takes precedence over all claims; security by way of floating charge may be postponed to the preferential creditors.

Claimants with non-monetary claims against the company may be able to enforce their rights against the company. For example, a party who had a valid contract for the purchase of land against the company may be able to obtain an order for specific performance, and compel the liquidator to transfer title to the land to them, upon tender of the purchase price.

After the removal of all assets which are subject to retention of title arrangements, fixed security, or are otherwise subject to proprietary claims of others, the liquidator will pay the claims against the company&#x27;s assets. Generally, the priority of claims on the company&#x27;s assets will be determined in the following order:
# Liquidators costs
# Creditors with fixed charge over assets
# Costs incurred by an administrator
# Amounts owing to employees for wages/superannuation
# Payments owing in respect of worker&#x27;s injuries
# Amounts owing to employees for leave
# Retrenchment payments owing to employees
# Creditors with floating charge over assets
# Creditors without security over assets
# Shareholders (Liquidating distribution)

Unclaimed assets will usually vest in the state as &quot;bona vacantia&quot;.

==Dissolution==

Having wound-up the company&#x27;s affairs, the liquidator must call a final meeting of the members (if it is a members&#x27; voluntary winding-up), creditors (if it is a compulsory winding-up) or both (if it is a creditors&#x27; voluntary winding-up). The liquidator is then usually required to send final accounts to the Registrar and to notify the court. The company is then dissolved.

However, in common jurisdictions, the court has a discretion for a period of time after dissolution to declare the dissolution void to enable the completion of any unfinished business.

==Striking off the register==
In some jurisdictions, the company may elect to simply be struck off the companies register as a cheaper alternative to a formal winding-up and dissolution. In such cases an application is made to the registrar of companies, who may strike off the company if there is reasonable cause to believe that the company is not carrying on business or has been wound-up and, after enquiry, no case is shown why the company should not be struck off.

However, in such cases the company may be restored to the register if it is just and equitable so to do (for example, if the rights of any creditors or members have been prejudiced).

In the event the company does not file an annual return or annual accounts, and the company&#x27;s file remains inactive, in due course, the registrar will strike the company off the register.

==Provisional liquidation==

Under the corporate insolvency laws of a number of common law jurisdictions, where a company has been engaged in misconduct or where the assets of the company are thought to be in jeopardy, it is sometimes possible to put a company into provisional liquidation, whereby a liquidator is appointed on an interim basis to safeguard the position of the company pending the hearing of the full winding-up petition. The duty of the provisional liquidator is to safeguard the assets of the company and maintain the status quo pending the hearing of the petition; the provisional liquidator does not assess claims against the company or try to distribute the company&#x27;s assets to creditors.

==Phoenix companies==
In the UK, many companies in debt decide it is more beneficial to start again by creating a new company, often referred to as a &quot;phoenix company&quot;. In business terms this will mean liquidating a company as the only option and then resuming under a different name with the same customers, clients and suppliers. In some circumstances it may appear ideal for the directors; however, if they trade under a name which is the same or substantially the same as the company in liquidation without approval from the Court, they will be committing an offence under §216 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (and equivalent legislation in UK regions). Persons participating in the management of the &#x27;phoenix&#x27; company may also be held personally liable for the debts of the company under §217 of the Insolvency Act unless the Court approval has been granted.

<text>Iceland is divided into six constituencies for the purpose of selecting representatives to parliament.

==History==
The current division was established by a 1999 constitution amendment and was an attempt to balance the weight of different districts of the country whereby voters in the rural districts have greater representation per head than voters in Reykjavík city and its suburbs. The new division comprises three countryside constituencies (NW, NE and S) and three city constituencies (RN, RS and SW). The imbalance of votes between city and country still exists and a provision in the election law states that if the number of votes per seat in parliament in one constituency goes below half of what it is in any other constituency, one seat shall be transferred between them. This has occurred three times, in the elections in 2007, 2013 and 2024. On each occasion, a seat was transferred from the Northwest constituency to the Southwest constituency.

==Composition==
The constituencies are the following:

Data for the table below is current as of the 2017 election:

<text>Macro-Arawakan is a proposed language family of South America and the Caribbean centered on the Arawakan languages. Sometimes, the proposal is called Arawakan, and the central family is called &quot;Maipurean&quot;.

==Proposals==
Kaufman (1990) includes the following:
**Arawakan (Maipurean)
**Arawan
**Guajiboan
**Candoshi
Payne (1991) and Derbyshire (1992) have:
**Arawakan (Maipurean)
**Arawan
**Guajiboan
**Puquina
**Harakmbet
Jolkesky (2016) argues for the following:
**Arawakan (Maipurean)
**Candoshi
**Puquina
**Munichi
According to Jolkesky (op. cit., 611-616), the proto-Macro-Arawakan language would have been spoken in the Middle Ucayali River Basin during the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE, and its speakers would have produced Tutishcainyo pottery in the region.

Martins (2005: 342–370) groups the Arawakan and Nadahup languages together as part of a proposed Makúan-Arawakan (Nadahup-Arawakan) family, but this proposal has been rejected by Aikhenvald (2006: 237).

Carvalho (2021) notes that the Arawakan and Arawan families have had significant long-term mutual interaction, but does not consider the two language families to be related. According to Carvalho (2021), the Juruá-Purus linguistic corridor had facilitated the migration of Arawakan speakers to the southern fringes of the Amazon basin.

<text>Michael King (15 December 1945 – 30 March 2004) was a New Zealand historian, author, and biographer. He wrote or edited over 30 books on New Zealand topics, including the best-selling &quot;Penguin History of New Zealand&quot;, which was the most popular New Zealand book of 2004.

==Life==
King was born in Wellington, one of four children to Eleanor and Lewis King, and grew up at Paremata. His Glasgow-born father was an advertising executive who had left New Zealand to serve as a naval officer in World War II and had risen to the rank of lieutenant-commander. King&#x27;s family moved to Auckland for a while, where he attended Sacred Heart College, then returned to Wellington, where he attended St Patrick&#x27;s College, Silverstream in Upper Hutt. He studied history at Victoria University of Wellington, working part-time for the &quot;Evening Post&quot;, and graduated with a BA in 1967. He married Ros Henry in 1967. They moved to Hamilton, where King worked full-time as a journalist at the &quot;Waikato Times&quot; newspaper from 1968 to 1971, covering Māori issues, and also earned an MA in history at the University of Waikato in 1968. He spent three years from 1972 as a journalism tutor at Wellington Polytechnic, before becoming a self-employed writer. He returned to the University of Waikato in 1977 to complete a doctoral thesis on Te Puea Herangi, and was awarded a DPhil in 1978. In 1997 he received an honorary DLitt at Victoria. He was visiting professor of New Zealand Studies at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and taught or held fellowships at six other universities.

Although not Māori himself, King was well known for his knowledge of Māori culture and history. &quot;New Zealand Listener,&quot; one of New Zealand&#x27;s most popular weekly magazines, dubbed King &quot;the people&#x27;s historian&quot; for his efforts to write about and for the local populace. As a biographer, King published works on Te Puea Herangi, Whina Cooper, Frank Sargeson (1995) and Janet Frame (2000). As a historian, King&#x27;s works include &quot;Being Pākehā&quot; (1985), &quot;Moriori&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Penguin History of New Zealand&quot; (July 2003), the latter of which was, by February 2004, into its seventh edition. In all, King wrote, co-wrote and edited more than 30 books on a diverse range of New Zealand topics. He contributed to all five volumes of the &quot;Dictionary of New Zealand Biography&quot;.

King was always sensitive to the fact that he was a Pākehā writing about the Māori world and always sought to establish close personal relationships with those he wrote about and their &quot;whānau, hapū&quot; and &quot;iwi&quot; authorities. He believed that all Pākehā had the same right to be called indigenous as Māori and disagreed with claims that only Māori have a spiritual association with mountains, lakes and rivers. He noted a recent tendency in literature to romanticise Māori life and indicated that certain aspects of Māori society in the pre-European era were harsher and less humane than the results of British colonisation.

King&#x27;s two children with his first wife Ros are the filmmaker Jonathan King and novelist Rachael King. The marriage ended amicably in 1974, while they were sharing a communal house with two other families. King was a diabetic and had post-polio syndrome. He received six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for throat cancer discovered in October 2003, which was in remission by 2004.

Following King&#x27;s death, an essay of his on John Money was published in an exhibition catalogue for the Eastern Southland Gallery in Gore; King had wanted to write a full biography on Money, but had been unable to get a sufficient grant to do so.

==Death==
King and his second wife, Maria Jungowska, were killed when their car crashed into a tree and caught fire near Maramarua, on State Highway 2 in north Waikato. The cause of the crash was a mystery at the time, but a coroner&#x27;s inquest determined it was most likely caused by driver inattention.

==Honours and awards==
In 1980, King won the Feltex television writers&#x27; award, and was awarded a Winston Churchill Fellowship. In the 1988 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to literature. Also in 1988, he received a Fulbright Visiting Writers&#x27; Fellowship.

He won several prizes at the New Zealand Book Awards: the award for non-fiction in 1978; the Wattie Book of the Year Award in 1984 and 1990; and in 2004 his book, &quot;The Penguin History of New Zealand&quot;, was overwhelmingly voted the readers&#x27; choice award winner. He received New Zealand Literary Fund awards in 1987 and 1989, and was the Burns Fellow at the University of Otago in 1998–1999.

King was winner of the 2003 Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement in non-fiction, and the same year &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; named him New Zealander of the Year.

== Legacy ==
New Zealand’s largest writing fellowship is the Creative New Zealand Michael King Writers’ Fellowship, it &quot;supports established writers to work on a major project over two or more years&quot;. Past fellows are: Owen Marshall, Vincent O’Sullivan, CK Stead, Rachel Barrowman, Neville Peat, Fiona Kidman, Philip Simpson and in 2023 Danny Keenan.

The Michael King Writers Centre was established shortly after his death. Based at the historic Signalman&#x27;s House in Devonport, Auckland, the centre offers writing residencies for early career and experienced writers.

<doc id="565076" wikidata="Q2860390" url="?curid=565076" title="Architecture of Montreal">
<text>The architecture of [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada is characterized by the juxtaposition of the old and the new and a wide variety of architectural styles, the legacy of two successive colonizations by the French, the British, and the close presence of modern architecture to the south. Much like Quebec City, the city of Montreal had fortifications, but they were destroyed between 1804 and 1817.

For over a century and a half, Montreal was the industrial and financial centre of Canada. The variety of buildings included factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries, which today provide a legacy of historic and architectural interest, especially in the Downtown area and in Old Montreal. Many historical buildings in Old Montreal retain their original form, notably the impressive 19th century headquarters of all major Canadian banks on Saint Jacques Street (formerly known as Saint James Street).

From the Art Deco period, Montreal offers a handful of notable examples: Ernest Cormier&#x27;s Université de Montréal main building located on the northern side of Mount Royal and the Aldred Building at Place d&#x27;Armes, an historic square in Old Montreal.

In fact, Place d&#x27;Armes, shown in panorama below, is surrounded by buildings representing several major periods in Montreal architecture: the Gothic Revival Notre-Dame Basilica; New York Life Building, Montreal&#x27;s first high-rise; the Pantheon-like Bank of Montreal head office, Canada&#x27;s first bank; the aforementioned Aldred Building. (1931) and the International style 500 Place D&#x27;Armes.

==Church architecture==

Founded as a Roman Catholic French colony and nicknamed &quot;la ville aux cent clochers&quot; (the city of a hundred belltowers), Montreal is renowned for its churches. The city has four Roman Catholic basilicas: Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, Notre-Dame Basilica, St. Patrick&#x27;s Basilica, and Saint Joseph&#x27;s Oratory. The Oratory is the largest church in Canada, with the largest dome of its kind in the world after that of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. Other well-known churches include Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, which is sometimes called the Sailors&#x27; Church.

Following the British victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, many protestant immigrants came to the city from England, Scotland and Ireland. This led to various Protestant churches being built to accommodate the growing community. The two most notable of these are the Saint James United Church and the Anglican Christ Church Cathedral, which was suspended above an excavated pit during the construction of the Promenades Cathédrale mall, part of Montreal&#x27;s Underground City. 
==Skyscrapers==
Skyscraper construction in Montreal has swung between periods of intense activity and prolonged lulls. A two-year period from 1962 to 1964 saw the completion of four of Montreal&#x27;s ten tallest buildings: Tour de la Bourse, I. M. Pei&#x27;s landmark cruciform Place Ville-Marie, the CIBC Building and CIL House. Its tallest buildings, the 51-storey 1000 de La Gauchetière and the 47-storey 1250 René-Lévesque, were both completed in 1992.

Montreal places height-limits on skyscrapers so that they do not exceed 200m in height nor the summit of Mount Royal. Only the St. Joseph&#x27;s Oratory reaches an elevation higher than 232.5 metres above mean sea level (Mount Royal elevation). Above-ground height is further limited in most areas and only a few downtown land plots are allowed to exceed 120 metres in height. The limit is currently attained by 1000 de La Gauchetière and 1250 René-Lévesque, the latter of which is shorter, but built on higher ground.

The Tour de Montréal, incorporated into the north base of Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium is the tallest inclined tower in the world, at .

==Expo 67==

Pavilions designed for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition, popularly known as Expo 67, featured a wide range of architectural designs. Though most pavilions were temporary structures, several remaining structures have become Montreal landmarks, including the geodesic dome US Pavilion, now the Montreal Biosphère, as well as Moshe Safdie&#x27;s striking Habitat 67 apartment complex. The French pavilion and Québec Pavilion of Expo 67 underwent significant renovations in 1992 to become the Montreal Casino.

==Montreal Metro==

In terms of modern architecture, the Montreal Metro is filled with a profusion of public art by some of the biggest names in Quebec culture. In addition, the design and ornamentation of each station in the Metro system is unique, much like the Stockholm Metro and the Moscow Metro.

==Other notable structures==

Other significant works of modern architecture in Montreal include the Brutalist Place Bonaventure, the world&#x27;s second largest commercial building when it was completed in 1967, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s Westmount Square and Roger Taillibert&#x27;s controversial Olympic Stadium, which incorporates the world&#x27;s tallest inclined tower, at 175 metres.

Montreal architects Pierre Boulva and Jacques David completed a number of modernist landmarks in the 1960s, including the Palais de justice de Montréal, 500 Place D&#x27;Armes, Théâtre Maisonneuve, the Dow Planetarium and the Place-des-Arts, Atwater and Lucien-L&#x27;Allier metro stations.

In 2006, the city was recognized by the international design community as a UNESCO City of Design, one of the three world design capitals.

==Heritage conservation==
The Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal advises the municipal government on matters related to heritage building preservation. A pair of non-governmental groups have worked to preserve Montreal historic buildings since the 1970s: Save Montreal, co-founded by Michael Fish in 1974, and Heritage Montreal, founded by Phyllis Lambert two years later. In 1979, Lambert founded the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA), an architecture museum and research centre located in downtown Montreal. In October 2009, Lambert, Heritage Montreal and others formed a think tank called the Institut de politiques alternatives de Montréal to advise the city on a range of matters including urban planning, development and heritage.

<text>The &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarine was a United States Navy submarine design, used primarily during World War II. They were the USN&#x27;s first fully successful fleet submarine, and began the war close to the fighting. Six of the class were in Hawaiian waters or the Central Pacific on 7 December 1941, with at Pearl Harbor during the attack. They went on to see hard service; seven of the twelve boats in the class were sunk before the survivors were withdrawn from front-line service in early 1945; this was the highest percentage lost of any US submarine class. &quot;Tautog&quot; was credited with sinking 26 ships, the largest number of ships sunk by a US submarine in World War II. The &quot;Tambor&quot;s attained the top speed of and range of (allowing patrols in Japanese home waters) of the preceding , and improvements included six bow torpedo tubes, a more reliable full diesel-electric propulsion plant, and improved combat efficiency with key personnel and equipment relocated to the conning tower. In some references, the &quot;Tambor&quot;s are called the &quot;T Class&quot;, and SS-206 through SS-211 are sometimes called the &quot;&quot;Gar&quot; class&quot;.

==Design history==

===Preliminary designs===
Early U.S. submarine designs of World War I assigned to escort shipping revealed that they had minimal ability to deter an aggressive threat. Despite the fact that German U-boats proved beyond a doubt that no navy could be a world sea power without submarines, the role played by U.S. submarines in the defense of the Pacific would have to be rethought by Navy planners.

Following the Armistice, and after testing the capabilities of German design via captured U-boats, the U.S. Navy began to see the potential for extended offensive submarine operations. Submarine operations with the fleet required boats with a high speed of 21 knots so that they could maneuver with the Standard-type battleships. A high endurance was also desired to enable sustained patrols in Japanese home waters, hopefully providing warning of enemy operations as well as sinking warships close to home. These qualities would later prove vital in commerce raiding during World War II, though this was largely absent from prewar planning due to the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. The huge advancement in American technology required to fill that role with &quot;a new all-purpose fleet submarine&quot; also became apparent.

The first attempt to produce a fleet submarine was the , later renamed the T class, launched 1918-19. These produced a high speed with four engines clutched together in tandem pairs. This design resulted in excessive vibration and engine damage, and the class was decommissioned in the 1920s and scrapped in 1930. The second attempt was the &quot;Barracuda&quot; class; the first three V-boats, launched 1924–25. These combined large direct drive main diesels with small diesel-electric diesels to achieve 21 knots. Their engines, built by the Bureau of Steam Engineering (BuEng) based on German MAN designs, were unreliable and the boats had poor seakeeping qualities. They were decommissioned in 1937 and saw only limited service, mostly training and experimental, in World War II.

A different direction, that of a large, long-range &quot;cruiser&quot; submarine with moderate speed, was taken with , , and , the second trio of V-boats launched 1927–30. These were influenced by German &quot;U-cruisers&quot; such as the Type U-139 of World War I. Up to overall and surfaced displacement, these were the largest non-nuclear submarines ever built by the United States. They were armed with a pair of 6-inch deck guns to allow engaging armed merchant cruisers or Q-ships on the surface. However, their huge size was a disadvantage in most tactical situations. They could not dive quickly and were slow in maneuvering. They found a role inserting raiders and supplying guerrillas in World War II, famously in the Makin Island raid but also in the Philippines.

After the unsuccessful attempts outlined above, Navy designers finally worked towards a practical fleet submarine. The first successful approaches to this were the Porpoise or &quot;P&quot;-class and / or new &quot;S&quot;-class submarines, launched 1935–1939. These were smaller, more maneuverable boats than the cruiser-type V-boats. However, the &quot;P&quot; class was lacking in speed and their early diesel-electric propulsion was vulnerable to arcing. Although the new &quot;S&quot; class had a faster &quot;composite&quot; power plant combining direct drive and diesel-electric components, they were somewhat lacking in reliability and firepower. Some of the new &quot;S&quot; class were equipped with the Hooven-Owens-Rentschler double-acting diesels, which had poor reliability.

===&quot;Tambor&quot;-class proposal===

In the fall of 1937 a proposal for an improved fleet submarine was put forward by the team of officers put together by then-Commander Charles A. Lockwood (later Admiral and Commander Submarine Force Pacific), Lt. Cmdr. Andrew McKee, planning officer at Portsmouth Navy Yard, and Lt. Armand M. Morgan, head of the Navy&#x27;s submarine design section. It was to be large (1,500 tons), and carry the latest diesel engines, ten torpedo tubes, a gun, and an updated Torpedo Data Computer. Habitability would be increased by the addition of fresh water distillation units and air conditioning.

However, the design concepts faced opposition from Admiral Thomas Hart, Chairman of the General Board. Hart stubbornly defended the building of small, coastal defense boats (without &quot;luxuries&quot; like air conditioning, whose primary function was not comfort but the elimination of prevalent electrical shorts). Through determination and skilled political maneuvering, the design of Lockwood&#x27;s team prevailed (though Hart would consent to only a gun). As with other classes, the small gun was to prevent submarines from attempting to engage heavily armed escorts on the surface. This design was finally adopted by the Navy&#x27;s General Board and the Submarine Officers&#x27; Conference for the 1939 program.

===Design specifications===

The &quot;Tambor&quot;s had several key improvements over the &quot;Sargo&quot; class. For the first time in a US submarine, six bow torpedo tubes were equipped. This had been delayed for several years due to an overestimate of the tonnage required for the two extra tubes. The four stern tubes of the &quot;Sargo&quot;s were retained. Larger torpedo rooms eliminated the deck stowage of torpedoes on previous classes, which was abandoned during World War II in any case. Combat efficiency was improved by relocating the sonar operators and the Torpedo Data Computer into an enlarged conning tower to enable direct communication with the captain, and a new periscope with a small head to avoid detection was equipped. The &quot;negative tank&quot; or &quot;down express&quot; tank found on some World War I-era S-boats was revived; this could be quickly flooded when diving to provide negative buoyancy and get the submarine under water more quickly. The hull had improved streamlining for a higher cruising speed.

Although the &quot;Tambor&quot;s were initially equipped with a 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber deck gun, Lockwood and the Submarine Officers&#x27; Conference prevailed upon Admiral Hart to allow a supporting deck strengthened to accommodate a 5-inch (127 mm)/51 caliber gun if experience warranted this. In 1942–43, four &quot;Tambor&quot;s: SS-198, SS-199, SS-200 (which was the first one to be so modified, with USS &quot;Bonita&quot;&#x27;s gun), SS-203, and two &quot;Gar&quot;s: SS-206, SS-209, were rearmed with the 5-inch/51 guns. All pieces were taken from the &quot;Barracuda&quot; class or spares for that class, as they were the only class with a submarine &quot;wet mount&quot; for that gun. As with many other submarines that started the war with the 3&quot;/50, the remaining &quot;Tambor&quot;s received 4-inch (102 mm)/50 caliber guns removed from old S-boats that were being withdrawn from combat service.

The full diesel-electric propulsion plant found in a few &quot;Sargo&quot;s was continued, and probably improvements over the &quot;Porpoise&quot; class eliminated the arcing that had plagued those boats. The &quot;new S-class&quot; had boats with either General Motors-Winton engines or Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (HOR) engines. The HOR engines proved very unreliable, and were replaced by early 1943. The non-GM engine selected was the Fairbanks-Morse 38 8-1/8 engine. Still used as backup power on nuclear submarines, this was one of the best submarine engines ever. The &quot;Tambor&quot;s were lucky; twelve of the subsequent boats were initially equipped with HORs, apparently to speed up production.

The &quot;Tambor&quot;s had a significant weakness: all four engines were in one compartment, making the boat very vulnerable to damage. This was corrected in the &quot;Gato&quot; class, whose test depth was also increased from to , based on testing of depth charges against &quot;Tambor&quot;.

====Mine armament====
The Tambor class could substitute mines in place of torpedoes. For the Mk 10 and Mk 12 type mines used in World War II, each torpedo could be replaced by as many as two mines, giving the submarine a true maximum capacity of 48 mines. However, doctrine was to retain at least four torpedoes on mine laying missions, which would limit the capacity to 40 mines, and this is often stated as the maximum in various publications. In practice during the war, submarines went out with at least 8 torpedoes, and the largest minefields laid were 32 mines. Post-war, the Mk 49 mine replaced the Mk 12, while the larger Mk 27 mine was also carried which only allowed one mine replacing one torpedo.

==Service==

Six &quot;Tambor&quot;s were in Hawaiian waters or the Central Pacific on 7 December 1941, with at Pearl Harbor during the attack. The remainder of the class was in the continental United States, recently commissioned or on trials. The bulk of the available submarines in the Pacific (not including any &quot;Tambor&quot;s) had been forward deployed to the Philippines in October 1941. The &quot;Tambor&quot;s went on to see hard service; seven of the twelve boats in the class were sunk before the survivors were withdrawn from front-line service for training and experimental duties in early 1945; this was the highest percentage lost of any US submarine class. &quot;Tautog&quot; was credited with sinking 26 ships, the largest number of ships sunk by a US submarine in World War II. Postwar, was a target in the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946, but was only lightly damaged. She was later expended as a target in 1948.

==Boats in class==
The last six of the &quot;Tambor&quot; class are often listed as &quot;&quot;Gar&quot;-class&quot; submarines. They were ordered in fiscal year 1940 (FY40); the previous six were ordered in FY39, and some design differences were anticipated. On 17 December 1938, the secretary of the navy decided that the FY40 class would duplicate the FY39 class. However, design collapse depth was increased from to , with test depth remaining at .

<text>Dingo is a Finnish rock band formed around 1982, which became one of the most popular Finnish bands in history.

The band&#x27;s style fused Finnish melancholy with catchy rock melodies. The band was led by the frontman Pertti Neumann (also known as Pertti Nieminen). For a few years at its peak, Dingo was one of the most popular Finnish rock bands and caused a phenomenon called &quot;Dingomania&quot; all over Finland. The band&#x27;s popularity was most prominent among teenage girls, although the band had listeners in all age groups.

Dingo&#x27;s number one hit was &quot;Autiotalo&quot; from 1984, also released in English as &quot;The House without a Name&quot;. A separate youth culture was formed in Finland, known as the Dingoes. Their success, however, was short-lived, and Dingo broke up in October 1986. The band regrouped in 1998 and continues to perform occasionally. The band has sold over 500,000 records in Finland.

Dingo has also released the songs &quot;Tell Me Now&quot; (1986), &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; (1986) and &quot;House Without A Name&quot; (1986) in English.

== Biography ==
=== 1980s ===
==== Beginnings ====
In early 1982 Pertti &quot;Neumann&quot; Nieminen started forming a new band for himself after his previous band MAC had broken up. Juha &quot;Quuppa&quot; Seitonen became the drummer for the new band and Jonttu Virta from the band Kieltolaki became the guitarist. At first, Neumann himself played the bass guitar instead of singing the vocals. The band was first named Sous-Pierre, which was soon shortened to Soho. However, a band in the United Kingdom was already using the name Soho, so the name of Neumann&#x27;s new band was changed to Dingo.

There are several different versions for the origin of the name Dingo. Neumann has later recollected that he thought of the name while reading a foreign magazine at a kiosk. According to Jonttu Virta, the name Dingo came from one of the band&#x27;s first songs, &quot;Nimeni on Dingo&quot;, which predated the band&#x27;s name.

Through different phases the band reached its permanent line-up and sent a demo to a number of labels including Finnlevy, CBS, EMI and Poko Rekords. Poko Rekords rejected the demo and there has been a rumour that the demo &quot;accidentally&quot; ended up in the wrong drawer. Hans Rautio, CBS&#x27;s chief of marketing at the time, has later recollected that the reason why CBS rejected Dingo&#x27;s demo was its bad quality and the vocalist&#x27;s unique style which he thought still needed improvement. On the other hand, it took only one song to convince Finnlevy, &quot;Hölmöläisten laiva&quot;. The demo also contained the band&#x27;s later hit &quot;Sinä ja minä&quot;. In June 1983 Timo Lindström from Finnlevy became interested in Dingo after the band had performed at Finnlevy&#x27;s talent seeking event and the band got a record deal.

Dingo recorded their first album &quot;Nimeni on Dingo&quot; before they started playing live gigs. The album sold well right from the beginning, though the band was initially in the shadow of another popular band from Pori, Yö, whose debut album &quot;Varietee&quot; had sold over 60,000 copies and instantly become number 1 on various charts. However, &quot;Nimeni on Dingo&quot; also went on to become a number one album and eventually outsold Yö&#x27;s debut album. Hits on Dingo&#x27;s debut album included &quot;Sinä ja minä&quot;, &quot;Levoton Tuhkimo&quot;, &quot;Lakatut varpaankynnet&quot; and &quot;Pistoolisankari&quot;.

==== Success years ====
In January 1984 Dingo&#x27;s song &quot;Sinä ja minä&quot; appeared on the &quot;Levyraati&quot; game show which it also ended up winning. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Nimeni on Dingo&quot; was published in April 1984 and remained among the most sold albums in Finland for the whole year. Pave Maijanen was selected as the band&#x27;s producer. An alternative to him would have been Jimi Sumén but Neumann ended up choosing Maijanen over him. Maijanen&#x27;s role in Dingo&#x27;s career has been said to have been so significant that he has even been called &quot;the sixth Dingo&quot;.

In the 1980s Dingo became also known for Neumann&#x27;s make-up and colourful outfits. Dingo&#x27;s style of dressing was mainly influenced by the earlier band Hanoi Rocks. The make-up and colourful outfits the band wore also caused opposition to the band among some circles. The band had to endure shout-outs and name calling.

Dingo&#x27;s success brought them a lot of fans. Dingo gained a reputation for being idolized by many teenagers. The blonde frontman Neumann was especially idolized, causing controversy in the rock circles.

After Eve left the band and replaced by Pepe at the end of 1984, the new single &quot;Autiotalo&quot; was released. The single climbed to the number one position on every chart and the band reached even greater fame. Dingo was no longer considered to be a band for teenage girls only, and they found fame among older people, including the teenagers&#x27; parents.

1985 was Dingo&#x27;s most successful year. In February 1985 the band was doing a photoshoot for their next album &quot;Kerjäläisten valtakunta&quot; in Agadir, Morocco. In the next month the album rose to the top spot in Finnish album ranking lists.

By the time the album &quot;Kerjäläisten valtakunta&quot; was published, the number of pre-orders reached the amount of a Finnish gold record (over 50 000 copies). The album remained as a number one for three to four months and in the end sold around 190 000 copies. Every song on the album became a hit, especially the single &quot;Kirjoitan&quot;. It can be said that Dingo became an all time number one in all aspects: fame, hysteria, sales, media value and the impact on Finnish rock music at the time. They influenced several different Finnish bands and musicians such as Pyhät Nuket (the hit &quot;Enkelit sulkivat silmänsä&quot;), SIG and Pave Maijanen. &quot;Kerjäläisten valtakunta&quot; still remains the fourth-most sold Finnish album of all time.

The band&#x27;s huge popularity also influenced the band&#x27;s income. Dingo&#x27;s average gig compensation was 30 thousand Finnish markka per gig, which was three times as high as that of other Finnish rock bands. On Midsummer in 1985 Dingo earned 130 thousand markka for one single gig, which was an unprecedented amount of money for a domestic artist in Finland at the time.

===== &quot;Dingo fever&quot; =====
The year 1984 was the year of the &quot;Dingo fever&quot;. It was no longer a question of rock music alone, but a sociologically interesting phenomenon as well. Dingo was not only a rock band but also a corporation. The band members were seen on TV programs and on magazine covers.

The band members got their first touch of the &quot;Dingo fever&quot; in March 1984 when the band started touring in Evijärvi. 3,700 people who had bought a ticket arrived at the scene, many of whom started shouting and screaming upon seeing the band. This hysteria came as a complete surprise to the band. In the summer the band was signing autographs at the Pukeva store in Helsinki. The situation rapidly became chaotic when hysterical fans started accidentally knocking down shelves. In the end the director of the Pukeva store had to tell Dingo to leave the store before the hysterical fans would destroy it entirely.

According to Peter von Bagh and Ilpo Hakasalo the &quot;Dingo fever&quot; of 1984 to 1985 was a unique phenomenon in the history of Finnish popular culture. According to von Bagh and Hakasalo, the last time such phenomenal idol worship had happened was at the time of Elvis Presley in the 1950s and The Beatles in the 1960s.

The Dingo fandom was most prominent among teenage girls. Fans wanted to come as close to their idols as possible, and the pressure caused by massive groups of people caused tens of girls to faint. The hysteria surrounding to Dingo started influencing the daily lives of the band members. They could no longer even walk around on the street without a hysterical group of fans surrounding them.
&quot;Dingo&#x27;s records are being sold like Päätalo&#x27;s books and girls are falling down like grandmas at Yli-Vainio&#x27;s meetings.&quot; &quot;(Journalist Arvo Tuominen at the A-studio TV show in 1985.)&quot;

The hysterical fans also tried to enter the band&#x27;s backstage rooms or their tour bus by force, and ran after the bus. The most enthusiastic fans set up camp around the band members&#x27; apartments in hopes of getting an autograph. There were organised trips to Pori including descriptions of the band members&#x27; homes. For example, one time when the band&#x27;s drummer Quuppa was mowing his lawn, he noticed a busload of people on the street following his actions.

The band started getting frustrated with the byproducts of their huge popularity, and they set limits on the number of interviews. Because of safety reasons, photographers for newspapers and magazines were no longer allowed on stage or at the backstage rooms. Dingo also set up limits on autograph sessions, and no longer stayed to give autographs to fans after their concerts. The press took this heightened security as a sign of arrogance and started writing about Dingo in a more critical tone.

At one time, the band members were brought to their concert venues in boxes, but after a few times, the fans started noticing this. The band members were in danger of suffocating inside their boxes when the fans surrounding them were blocking their air holes. There was also opposition to Dingo. At one time, a detonator for a dynamite charge was found at the footspace of the band&#x27;s tour bus, connected to the wires of the bus&#x27;s front lights.

In 1985, the singer-songwriter Juha Vainio published a song called &quot;Mies joka tapasi Dingon&quot; (Finnish for: &quot;The man who met Dingo&quot;). The idea of the song is based on real events. Vainio had met Neumann on a TV show and advised him on his rhymes. After the show was published, young girls started asking Vainio on the street if he was indeed the man who had met Dingo. They also asked for his autograph. The song is not specifically about the time Vainio himself met Dingo, but instead about an unnamed man who meets Dingo at an automated gas station and ends up thus being involuntarily famous. The song was Vainio&#x27;s humorous statement about the &quot;Dingo fever&quot; and the resulting loss of privacy.

Neumann&#x27;s philosophical preferences, the conscious avoiding of publicity and several trips to Ireland started to alienate Dingo&#x27;s younger audience. Yet Neumann&#x27;s solo single &quot;Mennään hiljaa markkinoille&quot; and the expectations of a new Dingo single kept the band in headlines. Finally in November 1985 &quot;Kunnian kentät&quot; was released, once again hitting a number one position in the chart. A new Dingo album was expected to be released at Christmas 1985, but Dingo chose have a huge and expensive tour around the country.

The year 1986 was the year of international dance music. Finland also had its own popular dance music group in the form of Bogart Co. Also, the album &quot;Kahdeksas ihme&quot; by Eppu Normaali reminded that there is excellent Finnish rock music other than Dingo. After a period of silence Dingo released their new album &quot;Pyhä klaani&quot;, which did not turn out to be as successful as their earlier albums. &quot;Koulukapina&quot;, &quot;Kreivin sormus&quot; and &quot;Suru tahtoo sua&quot; from the album were radio hits. &quot;Pyhä klaani&quot; also became a number 1, but the album only sold 80,000 copies, due to changes in Neumann&#x27;s musical style and especially his lyrics.

Around this time, Dingo had aspirations to release singles in English. The English version of &quot;Autiotalo&quot; (The house without a name) and the B-side, the English version of &quot;Kirjoitan&quot; (Tell me now) were not successful outside Finland. The next single released in Finnish was &quot;Juhannustanssit&quot; (&quot;the Midsummer Dance&quot;), released around the Midsummer time in 1986. This single was a wild rock song that pleased rock critics more than the general audience.

==== Break-up ====
When the fans gathered in Nivala, Tuiskula in the autumn of 1986, they were shocked by the news of their favourite band falling apart. In Nivala, Pete on the keyboards was replaced by Tumppi, who only had time to perform in the band for a few weeks.

From the remains of the Dingo members, a band called S.E.X was formed. The journey of S.E.X remained rather short, releasing only a few singles: &quot;Uuden aamun kitarat&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, and arguably &quot;Vierivä kivi&quot; sung by Pepe. They also released and &quot;S.E.X&quot; in a rather posthumous spirit.

=== 1990s ===
After the break-up, the members of Dingo were active in music each on their own between 1986 and 1993. Neumann and Pepe Laaksonen formed a band called S.E.X. in 1987 but the band broke up after publishing only a couple of singles and one album. Jonttu Virta played in the band QQ Blue, Pepe Laaksonen published a solo album called &quot;Veli Kuu&quot; and Quuppa was present in many different bands. Between 1986 and 1992 Neumann published three solo albums and served as chief of production at EMI in Finland in the early 1990s.

In March 1990 Dingo performed at a surprise gig at a gala event in Pori, hosted by Neumann. Pete Nuotio did not appear at the gig, Pave Maijanen played the keyboards instead of him. Dingo did not appear again after this one gig.

In autumn 1992 Dingo was offered 100 thousand markka for one concert but the band refused. According to Neumann, the reason was affected by his own solo album &quot;Tähti ja meripoika&quot; and his autobiography by the same name.

There were rumours of Dingo getting back together in 1990 and 1991, but only after publishing the compilation album &quot;Tuhkimotarina&quot;. In 1993, the band reunited to record a new song, &quot;Perjantai&quot;, for the compilation album &quot;Sinä ja minä&quot;. Finally, in the spring of 1994 a whole new studio album, &quot;Via Finlandia&quot;, was released on 30 April 1994, exactly ten years after the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Nimeni on Dingo&quot;. The most popular songs on the album were &quot;Elämäni sankari&quot; and &quot;Nähdään taas&quot;. Dingo also went on tour with Pave Maijanen on the keyboards. The band soon split up again, despite &quot;Via Finlandia&quot; having sold 13 thousand copies.

In 1996 a TV documentary called &quot;Nuoret sankarit: Dingon tarina&quot; was shown on YLE TV1 as the fourth part of the documentary series &quot;Kunnian kentät: Suomalaisen rockin 1980-luku&quot; documentary series. The documentary was written and directed by Axa Sorjanen. The documentary included interviews of all five classic members of the band as well as Lasse Norres, Pave Maijanen and the band&#x27;s original bass player Eve. The interviews have later been published unedited at the YLE Elävä arkisto service.

Dingo appeared with their classic line-up on the show &quot;Yllätys, yllätys&quot; at MTV3 performing an acoustic version of their song &quot;Hämähäkkimies&quot;. After this surprise performance the band did not continue performing.

=== 2000s ===

The keyboard player Pete Nuotio and the drummer Quuppa Seittonen left the band in January 2002 because of the band&#x27;s failure to come up with new music. The other members were also frustrated with the band&#x27;s inability to keep up with the times. After Nuotio and Seittonen had left, the band went on hiatus again. However, Neumann said the band would continue despite changes in its line-up.

On 31 December 2002 Dingo performed at the Saku Suurhall in Tallinn, Estonia with a special line-up. The line-up included Neumann and Jarkko Eve, as well as Jari &quot;Heinä&quot; Nieminen at the guitar, Pekka Kuorikoski at the keyboards and Vesa Aaltonen at the drums. The same line-up performed again at the Holiday Club Katinkulta in Vuokatti in February 2003 with the name Neumann Band Plays Dingo. Dingo&#x27;s former members did not want to appear at the line-up. Despite this, the concert was advertised as an event by the original Dingo band, even including a photograph of the original line-up, which angered the original members:
A concert in Tallinn is being advertised with the name and picture of Dingo, with Neumann appearing without the rest of the band members.

The New Year&#x27;s Eve show on the website of the Saku Suurhall is being advertised as &quot;The special guest of the evening is the legendary Finnish band Dingo, which has agreed to come together once again for this evening&quot;.

The former members of the band were puzzled by this.

&quot;This is outrageous. They are making business and earning money with principles that affect us former Dingo members. Surely this can&#x27;t be legal, at least it&#x27;s not honest&quot;, the keyboard player Pete Nuotio told &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot;.

Neumann defended himself by saying he owned the Dingo trademark and he could recreate the band if he wanted to. He also said that he could not have refused the offer, or else Saku Suurhall would have signed Aerosmith to appear on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2002. Neumann said he had asked Virta and Laaksonen to come to the concert, but they had refused. Neumann has later said he thinks of Dingo as a good and strong brand which is worth using.

Dingo has continued to release new material in the 2000s, including the single &quot;Musta leski&quot; in June 2005 and a whole album in the end of 2005. The band has continued to tour in a variety of line-ups, playing a combination of both the band&#x27;s old and new music.

<doc id="565111" wikidata="Q5019413" url="?curid=565111" title="Caledonian Airways">
<text>Caledonian Airways was a wholly private, independent charter airline in the United Kingdom formed in April 1961. It began with a single 104-seat Douglas DC-7C leased from the Belgian flag carrier Sabena. Caledonian grew rapidly over the coming years to become the leading transatlantic &quot;affinity group&quot; charter operator by the end of the decade. During that period, passenger numbers grew from just 8,000 in 1961 to 800,000 in 1970. The latter represented 22.7% of all British non-scheduled passengers. It also became Britain&#x27;s most consistently profitable and financially most secure independent airline of its era, never failing to make a profit in all its ten years of existence. By the end of 1970, Caledonian operated an all-jet fleet consisting of eleven aircraft and provided employment for over 1,000 workers. At that time, its principal activities included group charters between North America, Europe and the Far East using Boeing 707s, and general charter and inclusive tour (IT) activities in Europe utilising One-Elevens.

In 1970 Caledonian bought British United Airways (BUA), the largest contemporary independent airline and leading private sector scheduled carrier in the United Kingdom, and rebranded as British Caledonian.

==History==

===Inception===
Caledonian Airways was the brainchild of Adam Thomson, a former British European Airways (BEA) Viscount pilot and ex-Britavia captain, and John de la Haye, a former BEA flight steward and Cunard Eagle&#x27;s erstwhile New York office manager.

Thomson, de la Haye and three associates started Caledonian Airways from scratch with an initial investment of £54,000 raised from institutional investors on both sides of the Atlantic, many of which had a &quot;Scottish connection&quot;.

Initially, Thomson, de la Haye (the airline’s first Chairman) and their associates wanted to incorporate the new airline under the name Scottish Airways. When they found out that BEA had already reserved this name, the company was incorporated as Caledonian Airways (Prestwick) at Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Scotland, in April 1961 to conduct worldwide IT and group charter operations, with de la Haye and Thomson being appointed managing and deputy managing director respectively.

De la Haye was responsible for the famous Lion livery and tartan outfits for cabin crew. Later, he helped to pioneer business class, the helicopter link between LGW and LHR and the limousine service - some of these innovations were subsequently copied by other airlines. As the initial driver of branding, the famous Caledonian customer service and route expansion, de la Haye is generally recognized as the brainchild behind the airline’s early years and subsequent success, as described in a lengthy obituary in The Times. During the 70’s and early 80’s, having semi-retired due to ill-health, de la Haye retained the position of consultant to Sir Adam Thomson and fought hard to stop fleet diversification, which ultimately contributed to BCAL’s downfall and sale to BA due to huge costs incurred by operating multiple types of aircraft. A close friend of Herb Kelleher (Southwest Airlines) he recognized very early on that diverse fleets incur huge costs and was a strong proponent of keeping it simple.

Caledonian operated its inaugural flight on 29 November 1961 from Gatwick, the newly formed airline&#x27;s main operating base, to Barbados. The first revenue service, an immigrant charter under contract to London Transport Executive, operated the following day in the opposite direction.

The first fare-paying passengers to New York departed Glasgow Prestwick on 21 December 1961. They had paid £40 for the return trip.

Other destinations served during the first year of operations included Lourenço Marques.

The initial aircraft type operated was the Douglas DC-7C, the first of which was leased from Sabena in November 1961. This aircraft was lost in a fatal accident in Cameroon in March 1962. It was replaced the following month with another aircraft of the same type leased from the same source.

Caledonian&#x27;s first two DC-7Cs operated European and long-distance charter flights, carrying mainly tour groups, inclusive tour holidaymakers and members of the British Armed Forces. The Ministry of Defence approved Caledonian as a carrier for trooping flights in early 1962. IT flights to European holiday resorts began during summer 1962.

Two Caledonian Airways Douglas DC-7Cs appeared at the Biggin Hill Air Fair in May 1963; one to carry travel trade invitees on a special flight around the English south coast; the other to be viewed by the public while on static display at the airfield.

The DC-7C continued to be the main type flown during the early years. The last example was sold in September 1966.

The airline was emphasising its Scottish roots for marketing purposes by adding the tagline &quot;The Scottish International Airline&quot; immediately behind the Caledonian name on both sides of the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage, and by its female flight attendants wearing tartan uniforms. The company also sought to attract customers by providing an inflight service that was superior to what most other contemporary charter airlines offered, including complimentary meals, drinks and free overnight bags.

Max Wilson, the chairman of the &quot;Overseas Visitors&#x27; Club&quot;, one of the airline&#x27;s main group charterers, became Caledonian&#x27;s first majority shareholder.

In late 1963, the Donaldson Line, a Scottish shipping company, took a 25% minority stake in Caledonian by subscribing to new shares worth £32,000. This provided the resources to expand the airline&#x27;s freighting activities and to add a pair of DC-6Bs to its fleet in time for the following year&#x27;s European summer charter season. At the 1963 Biggin Hill Air Fair, Caledonian participated with two of its DC-7Cs. One of the newly acquired DC-6Bs could be viewed by the public while on static display at the 1964 Biggin Hill Air Fair.

===Attaining market leadership in transatlantic affinity group charters===
On 20 May 1963, the US Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), with Chairman and Managing Director John de la Haye as lead negotiator, granted Caledonian a foreign [air] carrier permit for a three-year period under Section 402 of the US Federal Aviation Act. It became effective on 17 June 1963 when it was signed by President John F. Kennedy, making Caledonian the first overseas charter carrier to obtain this permit. The so-called &quot;Caledonian Case&quot; established a precedent and constituted the legal basis for all airlines that had always wanted to operate charters to and from the US and Canada, but had been unable to overcome the objections of the established airlines, such as Pan Am and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), prior to the enactment of this law. Caledonian&#x27;s US breakthrough led to it being granted Canadian affinity group charter permission as well. The UK Air Transport Licensing Board (ATLB) licensed Caledonian to begin North Atlantic IT charters in September 1964.

Caledonian&#x27;s transatlantic growth strategy focused on taking advantage of strong ethnic ties of overseas Scottish communities in North America to the land of their ancestors and an obscure International Air Transport Association (IATA) resolution dating from 1953. Under this resolution, airlines were permitted to offer cut-price charter tariffs if these were negotiated with an individual representing a distinct group that shared a common affinity among its members prior to the application for charter transportation. The way independent charter operators like Caledonian, who were not IATA members, interpreted that resolution was that it applied to closed groups only whose primary purpose of travel was their common interest or kinship, rather than securing cheap air fares for its members. IATA imposed further restrictions on airlines seeking to exploit this loophole by insisting that any agent booking these flights had their commission capped at 5%, that the affinity group&#x27;s membership could not exceed 20,000 and that those seeking to avail themselves of these offers must have been members for at least six months prior to the commencement of travel. These restrictions were designed to protect IATA members&#x27; transatlantic scheduled traffic by preventing non-members from undercutting them.

To comply with IATA&#x27;s arbitrary transatlantic charter rules, Caledonian and other independent charter operators insisted that anyone who wanted a cheap transatlantic charter flight needed to be a &quot;bona fide&quot; member of an affinity group, and that the prospective traveller needed to be a member of such an organisation for a minimum period of six months. As a result, clubs and associations with names like &quot;Friends of Clan Albion&quot;, &quot;Anglo-Scottish-American Group&quot;, &quot;Anglo-American Families Association&quot;, &quot;Rose and Maple Amity Club&quot;, &quot;Paisley Buddies&quot;, &quot;British American Club&quot;, &quot;Canadian US Pacific Association&quot; etc. sprang up on both sides of the Atlantic.

As the charterer was responsible for paying for the aircraft&#x27;s entire capacity regardless of whether all seats were filled, there was a great temptation to let people, who were not eligible to travel under the affinity group rules, take the seats of other, eligible travellers who had cancelled their bookings. As a result, there were numerous occasions on which the airlines got into trouble with the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic. This made the system increasingly unworkable.

In 1967, Caledonian gained Presidential approval to carry passengers from 19 European countries to the US and to operate IT charters from the US to the UK, following authorisation by the CAB. Confirmation by the White House of the CAB&#x27;s decision to let Caledonian fly US-originating charter passengers to Britain made it at the time the only airline permitted to cater to the IT market on both sides of the Atlantic.

In 1968, the CAB agreed to expand Caledonian&#x27;s US IT charter authority to enable it to operate circle-tour charters between 19 European points and the US, with flights commencing the following year.

By 1969, more charter passengers were crossing the Atlantic with Caledonian than those flying on the transatlantic scheduled services of Aer Lingus, El Al, Sabena or Swissair.

By 1970, Caledonian was carrying the majority of the approximately 1.4 million passengers flying as members of affinity groups across the Atlantic each year.

Caledonian sought to differentiate itself from the other UK independent airlines and US supplemental carriers with which it competed in the transatlantic closed group charter market by providing a personalised, high quality full-scheduled-service style inflight service that exceeded most contemporary scheduled transatlantic operators&#x27; economy class service standards by a wide margin. On a typical transatlantic 707 charter, there were individually printed menus. The inflight service began with tartan-clad cabin staff serving each passenger free cocktails from the drinks trolley at each seat row as soon as the seat belt signs were turned off. This was followed by the main meal, starting with a separately served &quot;hors d&#x27;œuvre&quot; before serving a main course of fillet of beef, Tournedos, lamb or a chicken dish, accompanied by a selection of complimentary wines. Thereafter, a dessert course was served, followed by a choice from a cheese tray and a basket of fresh fruit. The inflight service concluded with tea or coffee being served with complimentary brandies and liqueurs, as well as free cigarettes for those who smoked.

===Further growth and new business opportunities===
Caledonian carried 110,700 passengers and made a net profit of £90,600 in its 1963–64 financial year.

Caledonian&#x27;s rapid growth as a profitable charter carrier did not satisfy the ambitions of its founders. Thomson and de la Haye&#x27;s long-term goal was to run a fully fledged scheduled operation. They considered Caledonian&#x27;s transformation into a scheduled airline the only way to build an airline with a long-term, stable future, rather than continuing to compete with &quot;boom and bust&quot; operators that were charging ruinous rates in an insecure charter market.

Caledonian first applied to the ATLB for a licence to launch transatlantic scheduled services from London to New York via Glasgow Prestwick in 1964. These flights were to operate twice-weekly using DC-7Cs. The fare level was to be similar to Loftleiðir&#x27;s.

During summer 1964, Caledonian added two leased Douglas DC-6Bs to its fleet to complement the DC-7Cs. The additional aircraft enabled Caledonian to operate an expanded European IT charter programme from London Gatwick, Manchester and Glasgow Prestwick.

On 21 September 1964, the ATLB announced its decision to reject Caledonian&#x27;s application for a licence to operate transatlantic scheduled services. It did however award the airline two licences to operate inclusive tours across the North Atlantic.

In December 1964, Caledonian acquired its first turboprop airliners, a pair of ex-BOAC Bristol 175 Britannia 300 series. These were mainly intended for use on transatlantic IT charters beginning in summer 1965. Over the coming years, additional examples were sourced from BOAC and Canadian Pacific Airlines, enabling the company to continue expanding its worldwide charter business. Britannias gradually replaced DC-7Cs. Caledonian operated a total of nine Britannias, the last of which was disposed of in May 1971.

Caledonian carried 148,000 passengers and earned a net profit of just over £200,000 in its 1965–66 financial year.

The ATLB granted Caledonian five licences to operate scheduled services from Scotland to the Med in 1966. These were the airline&#x27;s first scheduled service licences.

By the end of September 1966, Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), one of the two predecessors of Investors in Industry, acquired a 14% stake in Caledonian&#x27;s holding company. This improved access to capital to finance further growth, including new business ventures and fleet renewal.

Caledonian planned to introduce twice-weekly services from Prestwick to Barcelona and Ibiza for the 1967 summer season, making use of the licences the ATLB had awarded it the year before. However, these plans were shelved due to the Spanish authorities&#x27; refusal to grant reciprocal traffic rights.

During 1967, both Lyle Shipping and Great Universal Stores (GUS) became new shareholders of Caledonian Airways. These investments ended a period of uncertainty for the airline following the Donaldson Line&#x27;s voluntary liquidation. Lyle Shipping&#x27;s purchase of shares worth £125,000 increased Caledonian&#x27;s issued capital and reserves to £1 million. GUS were the owners of the Global travel organisation, a leading contemporary UK tour operator that contracted a growing share of its flying business to Caledonian. It acquired Donaldson&#x27;s 20% stake.

Caledonian re-applied to the ATLB for a licence to launch transatlantic scheduled services from Gatwick, Heathrow or Stansted via Prestwick to New York JFK, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Toronto, and from Birmingham via Prestwick to New York, in 1967. These services were to be gradually introduced between 1969/70 and 1970/71 utilising the new 707s. BUA, British Eagle and Transglobe Airways simultaneously applied for similar licences. Caledonian objected to the other independent airlines&#x27; applications. BOAC opposed all the independents&#x27; applications. The Board of Trade (BOT) directed the ATLB to prejudge the four contenders&#x27; applications in order to concentrate only on those that stood a reasonable chance of success under existing bilateral arrangements before the route licensing hearings could begin. As a result, BUA withdrew its own applications but objected to Caledonian&#x27;s and British Eagle&#x27;s. Transglobe withdrew its applications as well. Caledonian and British Eagle objected to each other&#x27;s applications. The ATLB heard Caledonian&#x27;s applications, British Eagle&#x27;s counter applications and BOAC&#x27;s objections in early 1968. Following the conclusion of the transatlantic scheduled licensing hearings in mid-1968, the ATLB rejected Caledonian&#x27;s and British Eagle&#x27;s applications. It felt that the independents generally lacked the financial strength to acquire the then latest widebodied and supersonic transport (SST) aircraft for their proposed services, and that these airlines had insufficient economies of scale to enable them to compete with BOAC and the American carriers on a level playing field. It also felt that it would take the independents too long to make these services profitable. In Caledonian&#x27;s case, the ATLB found that despite having a dedicated North American sales force and its own ground handling operation at John F. Kennedy Airport, the airline&#x27;s lack of any kind of scheduled service experience and its almost total reliance on Sabena&#x27;s and Aviation Traders&#x27; engineering support counted against granting it a scheduled service licence for one of the most competitive air markets in the world. Secondary factors for the ATLB&#x27;s rejection of Caledonian&#x27;s applications included the delay in the introduction of Concorde and the non-availability within the envisaged timeframe of widebodied aircraft that were smaller and carried a lower price tag than the Boeing 747, which would have made them better suited to the type of operation proposed.

Caledonian&#x27;s net profit grew to nearly £550,000 on turnover of £16.7 million in its 1969–70 financial year.

In spring 1970, Caledonian won a renewable, one-year contract from Qantas to carry migrants from Europe to Australia. The initial contract was worth £4.3 million. It was a sub-charter providing for the carriage of up to 40,000 passengers on approximately 220 flights.

===Becoming an all-jet operator===

From 1968, the Britannias were gradually replaced with state-of-the-art Boeing 707 jet equipment on long-haul routes. BAC One-Eleven 500s replaced the remaining Britannias on the company&#x27;s short-/medium-haul European IT operations from 1969.

When Caledonian&#x27;s senior management began evaluating competing state-of-the-art jet aircraft types as potential replacements for the Britannia in its long-haul role in the mid-1960s, the Boeing 707 320C series was favoured because of its superior range and payload compared with its contemporary rivals. Caledonian planned to place an order directly with Boeing for two convertible 707-320Cs that could either be operated in an all-passenger or all-cargo configuration and featured a large freight door on the left-hand side of the forward fuselage to enable carriage of main deck cargo when configured as a freighter. The initial order needed to be placed before the end of 1965 to secure the first aircraft&#x27;s delivery in May 1967, just in time for that year&#x27;s summer season. To avoid paying the 14% tax the UK Government had imposed on imported, new foreign aircraft to protect competing British models, Caledonian needed to persuade the BOT that there was no equivalent home-grown alternative. It also cited the BOT&#x27;s earlier decision to approve BOAC&#x27;s application for an import duty waiver on two new Boeing 707-336Cs as a precedent. However, the BOT was unwilling to grant Caledonian the requested tax exemption and was instead assisting Vickers in selling it the Super VC10, the stretched version of the original &quot;standard&quot; VC10 and Britain&#x27;s answer to the all-American 707 and DC-8. Despite the BOT&#x27;s and Vickers&#x27;s best efforts, Caledonian&#x27;s senior management remained unconvinced that the Super VC10 was a worthy competitor of the 707. The results of its evaluation had shown that the Super VC10 was not competitive with the 707, in terms of amortisation, resale value and availability of finance due to its small production run. Apart from its insufficient range to fly non-stop from the UK to the US West Coast with a viable payload, significantly smaller cargo capacity and lack of passenger/freighter convertibility, the Super VC10 was also heavier than the 707. This increased fuel consumption. In its ongoing negotiations with the BOT, Caledonian cited these findings as evidence that there was no suitable British alternative to the 707 for the envisaged role. The BOT however continued to insist that irrespective of Caledonian&#x27;s specific requirements, the 707 and Super VC10 were equivalent and, based on this assessment, refused the airline&#x27;s application for an import duty waiver. Meanwhile, the civil engine production hold-up caused by the Vietnam War resulted in the first aircraft arriving in July rather than May 1967. This did not allow its utilisation for that year&#x27;s full summer charter season precluding a profitable operation. These circumstances compelled Caledonian to lease out its first 707 to the Flying Tiger Line until May 1968. To facilitate the 707&#x27;s smooth introduction into service the following summer, Caledonian required access at its Gatwick base to its second aircraft (ordered in 1966) for as much as winter 1967–68 as possible to complete aircrew and ground support training in time for the following summer season. This was not possible as long as the standoff between the airline and the BOT continued. To avoid having an expensive, new jet aircraft sit idly on the ground in the absence of a timely resolution, the airline&#x27;s senior management put in place a contingency plan to transfer the 707 training programme to Shannon Airport as the BOT had no jurisdiction over the Republic of Ireland. In the event, the contingency plan was not activated as a compromise was reached in early December 1967 that resulted in the BOT granting Caledonian&#x27;s request for an import duty exemption. This permitted the airline to import the aircraft into the UK free of duty, as long as non-stop sectors outside the Super VC10&#x27;s economically viable range accounted for a significant share of its operations. It enabled Caledonian to take delivery of its second 707, a 399C series aircraft bearing the registration G-AVTW (&quot;Tango Whisky&quot;), at Gatwick on 30 December 1967. The first aircraft – Boeing 707-399C G-AVKA (&quot;Kilo Alpha&quot;) – joined the second at Gatwick on 1 June 1968, following the end of the Flying Tigers lease. Both began operating a series of charters, carrying 15,000 passengers from Los Angeles and Oakland to the UK.

Caledonian&#x27;s short-haul re-equipment effort to replace the remaining obsolete piston and turboprop airliners in its fleet, initially focused on Boeing&#x27;s 737. It intended to place an order for three series 200 aircraft before the end of 1967. The aircraft were to be delivered by spring 1969 to accomplish the transition to an all-jet fleet ahead of the 1969 summer charter season. As the 737 was an all-American aircraft like the previously ordered 707, Caledonian needed to approach the BOT once more to request an import tax exemption. Predictably, the BOT opposed this. It threatened to withdraw the tax concession it had granted the airline to import brand-new 707s free of duty if 737s were selected instead of One-Eleven 500s. Caledonian did not favour the One-Eleven 500 because it could not match the 737-200&#x27;s range, which was reckoned sufficient to fly British holidaymakers non-stop from the UK to the Canary Islands and to destinations in the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as lower costs per seat mile as a result of the latter&#x27;s wider fuselage accommodating a greater number of passengers seated six (rather than five) across. In the cut-throat short-/medium-haul charter airline business these were important cost and marketing advantages that could make all the difference between profit and loss. In addition to the risk of losing the BOT&#x27;s tax concession to import new 707s duty-free into the UK outweighing the 737-200s range and cost advantage over the One-Eleven 500, sterling&#x27;s devaluation together with increases in Boeing&#x27;s basic sales price had made ordering One-Elevens more attractive financially. Based on an order for four aircraft valued at £7.5 million, buying an equivalent number of 737s was £1–1.5 million more expensive. Another factor swinging Caledonian&#x27;s short-haul re-equipment decision in favour of the British aircraft was the manufacturer&#x27;s ability to offer the Scottish airline a high-density, 109-seat version featuring an increased range of (compared with for the baseline 97-seat, single-class One-Eleven 500 ordered by BEA). This brought most of the Mediterranean and North Africa within range. These considerations resulted in Caledonian placing an order for three One-Eleven 500s for delivery in 1969. It also took out an option on a fourth aircraft, which was to be delivered in 1970 if confirmed.

Caledonian Airways&#x27; acquisition of a 40% stake in tour operator Blue Sky Holidays&#x27; parent company Blue Cars for £1.3 million in January 1970 had secured sufficient additional short- and medium-haul charter work to enable the airline to convert the option it held on a fourth One-Eleven 500 into a firm order in time for that year&#x27;s summer season.

By the time Caledonian acquired BUA from British and Commonwealth (B&amp;C) in late November 1970, it operated a fleet of eleven state-of-the-art jet aircraft comprising seven Boeing 707-320Cs and four BAC One-Eleven 500s and had more than 1,000 employees.

===A new &quot;Second Force&quot;===

In the late 1960s, a parliamentary committee of inquiry headed by Professor Sir Ronald Edwards, at the time the chairman of the Electricity Council and a professor at the London School of Economics, inquired into the UK&#x27;s air transport industry and its prospects in the coming decade. At the conclusion of its inquiry, on 2 May 1969, the Edwards committee published a 394-page report entitled &quot;British Air Transport in the Seventies&quot;.

====Concept====
One of the Edwards report&#x27;s recommendations was the creation of a financially and managerially sound, so-called &quot;Second Force&quot; private sector airline to operate a viable network of short- and long-haul scheduled and non-scheduled services. This &quot;Second Force&quot; airline was to be licensed to compete with state-owned BEA and BOAC on selected short-/long-haul routes, in accordance with the relevant bilateral air transport agreements. Wherever bilateral agreements permitted a second British carrier, the &quot;Second Force&quot; was to assume this role. The &quot;Second Force&quot; was to be assisted in attaining critical mass by way of a limited route transfer from the corporations, both of which accounted for more than 90% of all UK scheduled air transport capacity in the late 1960s. In return, the &quot;National Air Holdings Board&quot; that was to assume control of the corporations was to be given a minority stake in the &quot;Second Force&quot; and at least one seat on its board. To enable the &quot;Second Force&quot; to become viable by 1980, its minimum size was to be at least 4 billion long-haul scheduled service seat miles (6.4 billion seat kilometres) per annum by 1975, and its fleet was to consist of at least 14 state-of-the-art long-haul aircraft, including three SSTs, three widebodied trijets and eight conventional narrow-bodied jets.

The Edwards committee considered BUA and Caledonian the two main constituents of the envisaged &quot;Second Force&quot; among Britain&#x27;s numerous contemporary independent airlines.

====Creation====
Following publication of the Edwards report, both BUA and Caledonian pitched for the role of the &quot;Second Force&quot; airline.

BUA&#x27;s bid to become the new &quot;Second Force&quot; centred on a six-year expansion plan that envisaged the progressive transfer of all of BOAC&#x27;s African routes to itself to complement existing African services from the airline&#x27;s Gatwick base, and unlimited frequencies between Gatwick and New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Airport. This route transfer was to be accomplished by 1975 while widebodied services to New York were to begin in 1974. The plan also hinted at a subsequent transfer of the corporation&#x27;s Caribbean and South American routes to strengthen BUA&#x27;s role as the new British North-South long-haul airline while leaving BOAC to concentrate on becoming the UK&#x27;s East-West long-haul carrier. BUA reckoned that this would give it the critical mass and rational route network to meet the Edwards committee&#x27;s minimum requirement of 4 billion annual scheduled long-haul seat miles (6.4 billion seat kilometres) to become an economically viable &quot;Second Force&quot;.

Caledonian opposed BUA&#x27;s advocacy of large-scale route transfers from the corporations. Rather than creating spheres of influence between the corporations and the independents, it advocated organic development through new licensing opportunities that would permit competition with the corporations on an equal footing, especially on North Atlantic routes, and security of tenure upon which to build a sound economic future.

Meanwhile, as a result of its disappointing financial performance, BUA became a growing burden on the Cayzers&#x27;, BUA&#x27;s controlling shareholders. This situation was made worse by the unexpected loss of one of its most important IT customers to the newly formed BEA Airtours. These events led to an approach to both corporations, with the intention of selling BUA to one of them. BEA, which was approached first, refused because it considered the price Sir Nicholas was asking for BUA – £9 million – too high. A subsequent approach to BOAC proved to be more successful. Sir Keith Granville, BOAC&#x27;s then managing director, agreed to purchase BUA from B&amp;C for £7.9 million. Roy Mason, at the time the President of the Board of Trade, gave the Government&#x27;s preliminary approval to BOAC&#x27;s proposed takeover of BUA, on the understanding that there were no realistic prospects of a merger with another independent airline as recommended in the Edwards report. When the details of this supposedly confidential agreement were leaked to the press, Caledonian, which had expressed its interest in acquiring BUA itself and had begun negotiations with BUA&#x27;s senior management on 5 March 1970 to make an offer to take over the ailing airline to create the &quot;Second Force&quot; as envisaged in the Edwards report, immediately applied to the ATLB for the revocation of all of BUA&#x27;s scheduled route licences, requesting them to be transferred to itself. It also leaked its own version of this story to &quot;The Observer&quot;. Following this revelation, Roy Mason made a statement to the House of Commons affirming that B&amp;C had misled him about the prospects of forming a &quot;Second Force&quot; airline through a merger with another independent, and that he was therefore going to withhold his final approval of the BOAC-BUA merger. This opened the way for Caledonian to make a successful counter bid for BUA, seeing off competition from that airline&#x27;s former managing directors Freddie Laker and Alan Bristow and from Channel Airways chairman Jack Jones. In its fight to win control of BUA, Caledonian had launched a parallel campaign to gain the support of BUA&#x27;s unions for its proposed merger. As part of this campaign, it had coined the slogans &quot;Better off at Caledonian&quot; and &quot;Better under Adam&quot;. Caledonian had also considered a merger with Britannia Airways as a fallback option in case the preferred option of merging with BUA had failed to materialise.

In November 1970, Caledonian merged with BUA. Initially operating under the interim name Caledonian//BUA, the merged entity adopted the British Caledonian name as of September 1971. During the 1970s and &#x27;80s, British Caledonian became the UK&#x27;s largest independent, international scheduled airline, with an extensive global route network serving over 40 destinations in around 25 countries on five continents.

==Caledonian Airways (1988-1999)==

British Airtours, the erstwhile wholly owned charter subsidiary of British Airways, adopted the popular Caledonian Airways brand in April 1988 when the newly privatised British Airways had completed the takeover of its former Gatwick-based rival British Caledonian. It also adopted a modified British Caledonian livery adapted from the contemporary, Landor Associates designed British Airways livery. The newly renamed Caledonian Airways moved its Gatwick operation from the airport&#x27;s South Terminal into the then brand-new North Terminal, thereby concentrating most of the British Airways group&#x27;s Gatwick services in the new terminal.

Caledonian Airways began replacing its Boeing 737 narrowbodies with additional ex-British Airways L-1011 Tristar widebodies and a number of brand-new Boeing 757s sourced from the large 757 orders placed by its parent company. The former British Airtours 737s were re-configured in British Airways&#x27;s contemporary short-haul two-class cabin arrangement and began replacing the BAC One-Eleven 500s British Airways had inherited from British Caledonian on the UK flag carrier&#x27;s short-haul Gatwick routes.

In 1995, British Airways decided to exit the short- to medium-haul package holiday market and sell Caledonian Airways to UK-based tour operator Inspirations, then part of the US-owned Carlson group, along with its core fleet of five Tristars. Following Caledonian&#x27;s sale to Inspirations, the 757s were returned to British Airways.

Inspirations became part of the Thomas Cook Group in 1999, when Caledonian Airways was merged with the Flying Colours airline to form JMC Air Services, which in turn became the UK arm of the now-defunct Thomas Cook Airlines.

Following Inspirations&#x27; takeover by Thomas Cook, the former Caledonian Airways Tristars were withdrawn from service as these had suffered increasing, widely publicised reliability problems resulting in the travelling public&#x27;s generally poor perception of Caledonian Airways &quot;Mark Two&quot;.

==Fleet==

In March 1970, Caledonian&#x27;s fleet comprised 13 aircraft.
1,000 people were employed.

==Accidents and incidents==
During its ten-year existence Caledonian suffered two accidents, one of which was fatal.

The fatal accident occurred on 4 March 1962. A Douglas DC-7C named &quot;Star of Robbie Burns&quot; (registration: G-ARUD) operating the Douala—Lisbon sector of Caledonian Airways flight 153 (a Lourenço Marques – Luxembourg charter on behalf of Trans Africa Air Coach of London) crashed shortly after a night takeoff from Douala Airport&#x27;s runway 12, killing all 111 occupants (ten crew and 101 passengers). At the time of the accident, the weather was very hot and humid. After a long takeoff run on the airport&#x27;s long runway, the aircraft gained insufficient height to clear the trees close to the runway end. The aircraft&#x27;s port wing struck trees above aerodrome elevation, some from the runway end and from the extended centreline. This resulted in the aircraft crashing into a tidal swamp and exploding on impact. Although this was the only fatal accident in Caledonian&#x27;s history, it was the deadliest air disaster in British aviation history at the time. The commission of inquiry probing the accident determined that the evidence at the crash site seemed to suggest that a jammed elevator spring tab mechanism prevented the aircraft from attaining sufficient height to clear the obstacles in the runway end&#x27;s vicinity. This would have resulted in abnormal elevator control forces during takeoff. It was also consistent with tests showing this to prolong takeoff runs that had an attendant risk of losing height during flap retraction when the aircraft became airborne. The commission of inquiry also described a number of adverse features that might have aggravated the circumstances in which the accident occurred. It had furthermore not been able to exclude the possibility of an instrument failure as a probable accident cause as the instruments were either not recovered or too damaged for a valid expert examination.

The non-fatal accident occurred on 28 September 1964. A Douglas DC-7C (registration: G-ASID) operating Caledonian&#x27;s flight 355 from London Gatwick via Istanbul Yeşilköy to Singapore crash-landed short of the threshold of Yeşilköy&#x27;s runway 24 when the aircraft&#x27;s left main gear struck the ground in line with the runway. This had caused the aircraft to bounce and touch down again 14m further on, which in turn resulted in the nose gear collapsing and engines no. 1 and 2 breaking off, followed by the separation of the entire port wing. The fuselage, which skidded down the runway, caught fire. Although the aircraft was completely destroyed, all 97 occupants (eight crew and 89 passengers) miraculously survived. The crash-landing followed an abandoned approach to Yeşilköy&#x27;s runway 24 in heavy rain. The approach was abandoned because the pilot-in-command could not see the runway lights. During the second approach VHF communications were lost for a short time due to the tower transmitter&#x27;s failure. When transmission resumed, the plane&#x27;s flightdeck crew reported lightning and heavy turbulence during its descent, and sighting the runway while descending to . This was followed by a slight correction to the right when the pilot-in-command ordered the deployment of full flaps and a reduction in power. It resulted in the plane sinking too quickly just short of the runway. Ordering an immediate increase in power did not prevent the plane from touching the ground short of the runway threshold. The subsequent accident investigation concluded that the probable cause was threefold:
# the late selection of full flaps and power reduction during the second approach,
# the crew&#x27;s inability to control the height precisely due to heavy rain and poor visibility, and
#the delay in ordering a power increase. The latter resulted in the aircraft undershooting the runway.

<text>David Carlyle Rocastle (2 May 1967 – 31 March 2001) was an English professional footballer who played as a midfielder in the roles of a playmaker and a winger.

He spent the majority of his career at Arsenal where he was nicknamed &quot;Rocky&quot;. Rocastle then went on to feature in the Premier League for Leeds United, Manchester City and Chelsea, before playing in the Football League for Norwich City and Hull City and finishing his career in Malaysia with Sabah FA. Rocastle also played for the England national team, in all earning 14 international caps for the &quot;Three Lions&quot;.

Arsène Wenger, who became Arsenal manager four years after Rocastle left the club, has described him as &quot;a modern player, because the revolution of the game has gone on to more technique, and more skill&quot; and as having an &quot;exceptional dimension as a footballer&quot;. Rocastle is seen as a universally popular, iconic and legendary figure by many fans of the Gunners, who often still chant his name at matches. The David Rocastle indoor centre at Arsenal&#x27;s academy is named after him and his name is displayed at the Emirates Stadium.

Rocastle was born in Lewisham on 2 May 1967 to Caribbean immigrants Leslie and Linda Rocastle, who moved to London during the 1950s. His father died aged 29 in 1972 from pneumonia when Rocastle was five years old, and his mother Linda subsequently remarried and had two more children. Rocastle attended the Turnham Primary School and the Roger Manwood secondary school in his teenage years.

===Arsenal===
After being rejected by Millwall, Rocastle joined Arsenal&#x27;s Academy under Terry Neill in May 1982 and was given a professional contract in December 1984 by Neill&#x27;s successor Don Howe. In his early career he faced problems with his eyesight, and contact lenses had to be used. According to his teammate Martin Keown &quot;They couldn&#x27;t work out why Rocastle was running around dribbling with his head down. So they took him to the halfway line and said: &#x27;Can you see the goal?&#x27; and he couldn&#x27;t. His eyesight was terrible. They sorted him out with contact lenses and his career took off.&quot;

He made his debut against Newcastle United 28 September 1985 and made 16 league appearances in the 1985–86 season, scoring once, against Aston Villa 8 March 1986, as Arsenal finished seventh in the league. Rocastles first goal came three weeks earlier in the FA-cup game against Luton Town 15 February which ended in a 2–2 draw. He remained a regular player in the first team following the departure of Don Howe and the appointment of George Graham as manager in May 1986.

In January 1987, Arsenal were away to Manchester United at Old Trafford. During the match Rocastle was sent off for retaliating to a tackle by United midfielder Norman Whiteside, a move which caused a huge scuffle between several of the opposing players. This scenario has been illustrated by many as the start of the fierce rivalry which now exists between the two clubs, especially as the two clubs being actively involved in competition for major honours almost every season since.

Rocastle, still only 19, went on to score the winning goal in the 1986–87 League Cup semi-final replay against Tottenham Hotspur which was won by a margin of 2 goals to 1 at White Hart Lane. The month before his 20th birthday he won a 1986–87 League Cup winners medal as Arsenal beat Liverpool 2–1 in the cup final at Wembley. Due to his feats during this season, Rocastle was bestowed with the honour of being named in the 1986–87 PFA Team of the Year and as well won the 1987 Barclays Young Eagle award. In the following season, he was again an influential member of the Arsenal side which reached the 1987–88 League Cup final against Luton Town the following year. In the game Arsenal surrendered a 2–1 lead with only seven minutes of the final left to play, and ended up losing 3–2 to a last minute Luton goal. He was also ever present for the Gunners in the 1987–88 season, helping Arsenal win the Football League Centenary Trophy in a 2–1 win over Manchester United.

Rocastle&#x27;s first league championship with Arsenal came in 1988–89, when he played in every game that season. Rocastle&#x27;s memorable solo strike against Middlesbrough 19 November 1988 and a lob from 30 yards against Aston Villa 31 December 1988 stood out during the title winning season. The success was sealed when they beat Liverpool 2–0 in the final game of the season at Anfield, snatching the title from the hosts on goals scored. Once again Rocastle won the Barclays Young Eagle award, with the honour bestowed upon him at the end of the 1989 season. Arsenal were however unable to compete in the 1989–90 European Cup because the ban on English clubs in European competition after the 1985 Heysel tragedy still had one year to run, but Rocastle would have the chance of playing in Europe&#x27;s premier club competition twice over the next few seasons. Arsenal went on to finish fourth in the 1989–90 league season, missing out on a return to Europe as only the runners-up were entitled to a UEFA Cup place. Rocastle was struggling with a knee injury and had a decline in form, so he had an exploratory surgery on his knee to come back before the end of the season.

In 1990–91, Rocastle was limited to just 16 league appearances but he still played more than enough games to win another league title medal with Arsenal, who lost only one game that season. He started the games in the first two months of that winning season. Rocastle played against Manchester United 20 October 1990 at Old Trafford, and was involved and fined after the brawl. When he returned after two months absence at Boxing Day against Derby County, he broke his toe in the first minute of the game, and a new operation of his knee was also required.

The following season, he played 39 league games for the Gunners, and a renaissance for Rocastle playing in a modified role in central midfield. The new signing Ian Wright and Rocastle were childhood friends who went on to represent the Gunners together in the 1991–92 campaign. His last appearance in an Arsenal shirt was against Southampton 2 May 1992 in a 5–1 win. He scored four league goals in his last season. The most memorable, on 19 October 1991, was a lob from 25 yards over Peter Schmeichel at Old Trafford in a 1–1 draw. His last goal for Arsenal, again against Manchester United at Highbury 1 February 1992 in a 1–1 draw, came from a cross from Wright. Rocastle was also tasting European football for the first time as Arsenal reached the second round of the European Cup.

In seven seasons for Arsenal, Rocastle played 277 first team games and scored 34 goals, collecting two league title medals and a winner&#x27;s medal in the League Cup, and playing the 1989 FA Charity Shield and 1991 FA Charity Shield at Wembley.

On 23 July 1992, Rocastle&#x27;s spell at Arsenal came to an end when he was sold to reigning league champions Leeds United, in a deal that several Arsenal fans, teammates and football writers saw as doltish, cold and woeful. This view stemmed from the way in which the midfielder was dealt with by manager George Graham, given his fine performances and return to fitness during 1991–92, his general popularity and the player&#x27;s stated opposition to the deal.

===Leeds United===

Rocastle&#x27;s arrival at Leeds United made him, up to that point, the club&#x27;s&#x27; most expensive signing at up to £2 million. Manager Howard Wilkinson saw Rocastle as an eventual replacement for the veteran midfielder Gordon Strachan. However, Strachan would go on to spend nearly three more years at Elland Road and remained a regular first team player for two more seasons, by which time Rocastle had left the West Yorkshire club. He went on to play a total of 34 games for Leeds, only half of them in the starting line-up.

He made his debut for the club in a European Cup tie away to Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart 16 September 1992 in a 3–0 defeat. Rocastle did not start in the new Premier League until 21 November against his former club Arsenal in a 3–0 win at Elland Road. He scored his first goal for Leeds in a 1–0 win against Manchester City 13 March 1993. Many Leeds fans would have liked to see the manager Wilkinson place more faith in Rocastle, because he was a popular figure, with glimpses of his outstanding technical ability shining through in spite of repeated injury problems. Rocastle scored his second and last goal in the following season for Leeds in a 4–1 victory over Chelsea 6 November 1993. His last game for Leeds came in the Premier League as a substitute for Strachan against Arsenal 18 December 1993.

===Manchester City===
Late in December 1993, he moved to Maine Road as replacement for David White, who in turn had joined Leeds earlier that month. Rocastle moved to City in a straight swap valued at £2 million and he made his debut against Southampton in a 1–1 draw 28 December 1993.

He was an instant hit with the fans and his class shone through immediately in a side that included a number of budget signings. Even though he was only 26, he had suffered numerous injuries in recent seasons and they were beginning to take their toll. But Rocastle still had what it took to thrill the City fans and, against Ipswich Town 5 February 1994, he produced one moment of Brazilian skill that set up a goal for Carl Griffiths and all but lifted the roof off Maine Road. It was a dummy, feign and drag back that saw him spin away from three defenders before his low cross was turned in by Griffiths at the near post to make it 1–1.

In Manchester City Rocastle scored two goals as City finished 16th in the Premier League – their lowest finish since winning promotion to the top flight in 1989. Rocastle scored the winning goal against Swindon Town 26 February 1994, and his second 5 March against Queens Park Rangers in a 1–1 draw at Loftus Road.

Though his career hadn&#x27;t flourished since leaving his beloved Gunners, Rocastle&#x27;s time with the Blues proved that, on his day, he was still one of the best English midfielders of his generation. He only played 23 games for City and it&#x27;s amazing he made the impact he did given that he was only with the club for eight months, but he had and there was a great deal of disappointment when he was allowed to join Chelsea a few weeks before the 1994/95 season.

===Chelsea===
By the time Rocastle arrived at Chelsea from Man City in August 1994 for £1.25 million, his knee problem was common knowledge in the game. However, Chelsea manager Glenn Hoddle took the view that sixty minutes of Rocastle was worth ninety minutes of many other players. Hence he started regularly, but was substituted in two-thirds of the thirty-nine games he played that first season. His debut came 20 August 1994 at Stamford Bridge against Norwich City in a 2–0 win. Rocastle would go on to play 40 times for Chelsea and scored two goals in his time there. One of these came in a League Cup win over AFC Bournemouth, with the other being netted in a 1995 European Cup Winners Cup first-round game against FK Viktoria Žižkov. His performance in midfield on a memorable night 14 March 1995, when a 1–0 deficit against Club Brugge KV was overturned to send Chelsea through to the final-four, was probably his finest hour for them, even though he was inevitably substituted with thirty minutes to go. His experience proved invaluable throughout a European Cup-Winners Cup run which ended at the Semi-Final stage, going out to eventual winners Real Zaragoza by a single goal on aggregate.

Injury problems returned to haunt Rocastle in 1995–96, and he played just one game all season at Blackburn Rovers 28 October 1995. This would be the last game that Rocastle played for Chelsea, although he remained with the club until his contract at Chelsea expired in the summer of 1998.

Rocastle was loaned out to Norwich City in Division One, and made his Norwich debut against Grimsby Town on 18 January 1997. Rocastle impressed the Norwich fans with his intelligent passing and commitment and Mike Walker extended his loan spell for a second month. However Norwich were unable to meet his wage demands and Rocastle returned to Chelsea after 11 games in yellow and green. Rocastle also had trials with clubs including Aberdeen and Southampton shortly afterwards.

In October 1997, Rocastle was loaned out to Hull City in Division Three, and scored on his debut for the Tigers against Scarborough. Rocastle&#x27;s final appearance for Hull City, a 2–1 defeat at home to Chester on Boxing Day 1997, also proved to be his last in English football.

===Sabah FA===
Rocastle eventually left Chelsea in 1998 to join up with Malaysian team Sabah on a free transfer. He quickly became a highly influential and popular player at the club and still had the knack of occasionally producing outstanding goals. Perhaps the best from his Malaysia stint was a long-range effort in a 4–1 home win against Perak, at the Likas Stadium in Kota Kinabalu, as Rocastle volleyed the ball in from 50 metres. Rocastle then saw Sabah upon a memorable run to the 1998 Malaysian FA Cup final where he earned a runners up medal. He eventually brought his playing days to an end in December 1999 due to injury.

==International career==
After making two appearances for the England &#x27;B&#x27; side, Rocastle was capped 14 times at under-21 level for England during the second half of the 1980s, scoring twice. Whilst playing for the Young Lions, he earned a runners-up medal in the 1988 Toulon Tournament and got to the UEFA European Under-21 Championship semi-finals of the same year.

Aged 21, he was capped at senior level for the first time against Denmark on 14 September 1988. Rocastle never found himself on the losing side as England won seven of the internationals that he appeared in and drew the other seven. A knee operation in 1990 put him out of World Cup contention after he had been an England regular. Rocastle was excluded although he had played in five of England&#x27;s six World Cup qualifying matches. He was one of 26 players chosen by the manager, Bobby Robson, to go to training camp before the tournament, but he was one of four dropped from the official 22-man squad. Graham Taylor recalled Rocastle three times afterwards but he wasn&#x27;t selected for the 1992 Euros. His final appearance for England came just after his 25th birthday, on 17 May 1992 against Brazil. Rocastle won 14 full caps for England but did not score.

==Illness and death==
In February 2001, Rocastle announced that he was suffering from non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, an aggressive form of cancer which attacks the immune system, and had been diagnosed the previous October. He underwent a course of chemotherapy and was hopeful of a recovery. He died on 31 March 2001, aged 33, and was surrounded by his wife and children. Many years later, it was revealed that Rocastle&#x27;s cancer had been declared terminal from the time of his diagnosis in October 2000.

Six weeks after Rocastle&#x27;s death, his nine-year-old son Ryan was Arsenal&#x27;s mascot for their FA Cup final match against Liverpool, a match in which they took the lead but ultimately lost 2–1.

Five years and a day after his death, 1 April 2006 was designated &quot;David Rocastle Day&quot;, as part of the celebrations of Arsenal&#x27;s final season at Highbury. Upon the day a league game was played which saw a brace from Thierry Henry in an eventual 5–0 win for Arsenal over Aston Villa. Fans paid tribute to Rocastle before the start of the match with a minute&#x27;s applause.

In August 2006, Arsenal opened the David Rocastle indoor centre at the club&#x27;s academy, located at Hale End in Walthamstow, London. Rocastle is also one of 32 Arsenal legends honoured by having their images illustrated on the side of the new Emirates Stadium. On 30 March 2013, Arsenal played a game which marked the 12-year anniversary of Rocastle&#x27;s death. The fans sang his name throughout the first ten minutes, and his famous quote of &quot;Remember who you are, what you are, and who you represent!&quot; was shown on the screen. Just after this, Arsenal scored the first goal in a 4–1 victory in the match against Reading. Hull City paid tribute to Rocastle by erecting a sign in his honour at the KC Stadium for their league match against Arsenal in May 2015. On 2 April 2016, Arsenal&#x27;s fans paid another similar tribute to him at the Emirates during Arsenal&#x27;s match against Watford, which marked the 15th anniversary of Rocastle&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==
Rocastle had three children with his wife Janet – son Ryan and daughters Melissa and Monique.

He is the cousin of another professional footballer, Craig Rocastle, and his brother Stephen played for Norwich City and was on the books of Derry City as well.

==The David Rocastle Trust==
The David Rocastle Trust was a charity based in London, UK founded in memory of Rocastle. The charity, which was chosen by Arsenal as their club charity for the 2005–06 season, supported Rocastle&#x27;s family as well as community projects and other registered charities.
The charity shut down in 2010.

<doc id="565114" wikidata="Q2939901" url="?curid=565114" title="Carole James">
<text>Carole Alison James (born December 22, 1957) is a Canadian politician and former public administrator, who represented Victoria-Beacon Hill in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 2005 to 2020. A member of the British Columbia New Democratic Party (NDP), she was the party&#x27;s leader and Leader of the Opposition in British Columbia from 2005 to 2011. Following her resignation as leader, she stayed in politics and served as the 14th deputy premier of British Columbia and minister of finance under John Horgan, from 2017 to 2020.

==Background==
James was born in Dukinfield, Cheshire, England, and raised in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, and in Victoria, British Columbia. After graduating from high school, James and her first husband worked in institutions for the developmentally disabled in Alberta and British Columbia. As a mother of young children, Alison and Evan, she became involved in a parents&#x27; group in Victoria, which led to her first foray into politics. In 2004, James married her long-time partner, Albert Gerow, a First Nations artist and former Burns Lake municipal councillor and Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer. Gerow was the chief of the Ts&#x27;il Kaz Koh First Nation in Burns Lake. James has been a foster parent for over twenty years.

On July 13, 2006, James announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with localized uterine endometrial cancer. She underwent surgery and radiation treatment and her prognosis is considered to be excellent. In March 2020, James announced that she was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and did not run in the 2020 British Columbia general election.

==Early career==
James served on the Greater Victoria School Board from 1990 to 2001, including seven terms as chair, and gained a province-wide profile in her unprecedented five terms as president of the BC School Trustees Association. She also served at the national level as vice-president of the Canadian School Boards Association. From 1999 to 2001, James held the position of director of child care policy for the British Columbia government. In addition, she served on several local and provincial panels and committees.

In 2001, James ran unsuccessfully for the NDP in the riding of Victoria-Beacon Hill only losing by 35 votes to BC Liberal candidate Jeff Bray. She subsequently moved to Prince George, British Columbia, to serve as the director of child and family services for Carrier Sekani Family Services, and later as co-ordinator of the Northern Aboriginal Authority for Families.

==Political career==

=== BC NDP leadership ===
James was elected leader of the provincial NDP on November 23, 2003. At the time of her election the party was suffering low morale in the wake of the 2001 provincial election, which had reduced the NDP to only two seats in the Legislative Assembly. During her campaign to win the party leadership, James pledged to modernize the NDP&#x27;s ideology and internal structures and build a broader base of support for the party, a move which alienated some traditional supporters.

During the 2005 provincial election, James campaigned heavily on her name and image. On election night James and the NDP surprised many supporters and critics alike with a very strong electoral showing; the party winning 41.52 per cent of the popular vote (a 19.96 per cent increase from the 2001 election result) and 33 out of 79 seats in the Legislative Assembly. James won her seat in the riding of Victoria-Beacon Hill with 57.01 per cent of the vote, defeating the incumbent BC Liberal MLA Jeff Bray by an almost 2-1 margin. She was re-elected in 2009, 2013, and 2017.

===Leadership controversy and resignation===
On December 1, 2010, Jenny Kwan, a prominent party member, released a statement to the media criticizing James&#x27;s leadership of the New Democratic Party, and calling for an immediate leadership convention. In response to Kwan&#x27;s statement, James called an emergency caucus session to address opposition to her continued leadership. While the session was meant to take place on December 5, it was later postponed so that private discussions could take place with a group of thirteen caucus members opposed to James&#x27; continued leadership.

On short notice on December 6, James announced she would resign the party&#x27;s leadership. She continued in the position, however, until Dawn Black was chosen to act as Interim Leader.

James served as opposition Critic for Children and Family Development under her successor, Adrian Dix. She was promoted to the Finance portfolio under John Horgan, and was also named deputy leader of the BC NDP and hence Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

=== In government ===
When the BC NDP won a minority government in 2017, James became deputy premier and Finance minister. She resigned from both positions in 2020, shortly after leaving the provincial legislature.

<doc id="565115" wikidata="Q1893872" url="?curid=565115" title="Marco Polo (game)">
<text>Marco Polo () is a form of tag played in a swimming pool.

==Rules==
One player is chosen as &quot;it&quot;. That player, with closed eyes, tries to find and tag any one of the other players, relying on hearing to find someone to tag. The player who is &quot;it&quot; shouts &quot;Marco&quot; and the other players must all respond by shouting &quot;Polo&quot;, which the &quot;it&quot; player uses to try to find them. If a player is tagged, then that player becomes &quot;it&quot;. If &quot;it&quot; suspects that a player has left the pool, they can shout, &quot;fish out of water!&quot; and the player who is out of the pool becomes the new &quot;it&quot;.

The game can also be played on land. It is similar to Blind Man&#x27;s Buff, where one person is blindfolded while others choose hiding places around the room. While playing, one cannot hold another player in place to be tagged or that person is it.

==History==
The game shares its name with the 13th-century Italian trader and explorer Marco Polo.

There does not appear to be any real connection between the game and the explorer of the same name, Although according to one whimsical explanation, &quot;legend has it that the famed explorer didn&#x27;t have a clue as to where he was going&quot;, this being reflected in the &quot;it&quot; player&#x27;s behavior. Although water polo is another popular pool game, the name of &quot;Marco Polo&quot; is unrelated.

The game shares similar traits with blind man&#x27;s buff, an essentially identical game played on dry land that dates back to at least the 16th century. Marco Polo was known as a water game in America by the 1960s. Between 1965 and 1970, some respondents to a Dictionary of American Regional English survey, when asked to name a game played in the water, responded with &quot;Marco Polo&quot;. By the mid-1970s, the game had spread and become very popular in swimming pools frequented by expatriates living in Hong Kong. It did not reach swimming pools in the United Kingdom until later, likely from British children returning from Hong Kong for their studies.

In modern times, Marco Polo is played worldwide. Various regions have their own versions of the game, with names such as Mermaid on the Rocks and Alligator. The term &quot;Marco Polo game&quot; is sometimes used to describe an online game where a similar call-and-response system of gameplay is adopted.

==Analysis==
Marco Polo is an &quot;easily modifiable game&quot;, and is based on the notion of call-and-response. Marco Polo is a location-based game because players are confined to a set space and because players must locate each other using auditory clues. Encyclopedia of Play in Today&#x27;s Society argues &quot;there is bipolarity in the reversal of roles...there are repeated actions, a routine to be repeated, rules to be observed, and verbal signs to be used&quot;. Playing this game can allow children to experiment with different social roles, for example learning what it means to be an outcast in the role of &quot;it&quot; (isolated, confined to a space, and unable to see others). According to the Nevada Regional Medical Center, &quot;Marco Polo is not only fun, it can be a good workout. It also puts less stress on your bones and joints because the water makes your body float.&quot;

==In popular culture==
There is an episode of &quot;Modern Family&quot;, season 6 episode 4, named &quot;Marco Polo.&quot; The game is referred to various times, but never explained nor fully played.

Marco Polo is the season 5, episode 8 of The Sopranos - the family play the game at the end of a house party which leads to the estranged Tony and Carmela spending the night together.

<doc id="565137" wikidata="Q895385" url="?curid=565137" title="Bow River">
<text>The Bow River is a river in Alberta, Canada. It begins within the Canadian Rocky Mountains and winds through the Alberta foothills onto the prairies, where it meets the Oldman River, the two then forming the South Saskatchewan River. These waters ultimately flow through the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. The Bow River runs through the city of Calgary, taking in the Elbow River at the historic site of Fort Calgary near downtown. The Bow River pathway, developed along the river&#x27;s banks, is considered a part of Calgary&#x27;s self-image.

First Nations made varied use of the river for sustenance before settlers of European origin arrived, such as using its valleys in the buffalo hunt. The name &quot;Bow &quot;refers to the reeds that grew along its banks and were used by the First Nations to make bows; the Blackfoot language name for the river is , meaning &quot;river where bow reeds grow&quot;.

The river is an important source of water for irrigation and drinking water. Between the years 1910 and 1960, the Bow River and its tributaries were engineered to provide hydroelectric power, primarily for Calgary&#x27;s use. This significantly altered the river&#x27;s flow and certain ecosystems.

The river&#x27;s source is from the Bow Glacier, which is part of the Wapta Icefield. The outflow from this source flows into Bow Lake in the Canadian Rockies. It flows south to the village of Lake Louise then turns east and flows through the town of Banff and through Canmore. The Ghost Lake reservoir is formed upstream from the town of Cochrane. The Bow flows eastward to the city of Calgary; it continues on to form the South Saskatchewan River when the Bow joins with the Oldman River near Grassy Lake in southern Alberta. It reaches the Hudson Bay through the Saskatchewan River, Lake Winnipeg, and Nelson River.

Communities along the Bow include Lake Louise, Banff, Canmore, Cochrane, Calgary, and Arrowwood. The Bow Falls are on the river&#x27;s course, near Banff.

The Bow River has a total length of and a drainage area of .

==History==

===First Nations===
First Nations populations have lived in the Bow region for thousands of years. Among them were the Nakoda, Tsuu Tʼina, and the Blackfoot Confederacy, consisting of the Kainai, Piikanai, and Siksika peoples. The Kutenai had migrated westward, possibly in the early eighteenth century, but still occasionally ventured into the Bow region to hunt bison.

First Nations used the river&#x27;s valleys for the buffalo hunt, in which herds of buffalo were driven over cliffs or into valleys where they could be killed more easily with bows and arrows. Of all the First Nations groups that lived in the Bow River area, only the Nakoda fished the river regularly. While other groups likely caught fish during harder times, they primarily hunted buffalo during the summer season when fishing would have been most plentiful. The river&#x27;s water naturally attracted game, which the First Nations men also hunted, while women gathered the roots, nuts and berries and processed them for food. The river&#x27;s game, its local sources for firewood, and its valleys&#x27; shelter made the river a common camp location for First Nations during the prairie winters. The danger of crossing the river meant it was a natural boundary for First Nations. The two main fords of the lower Bow River, Blackfoot Crossing and a ford near the Bow&#x27;s confluence with the Elbow River (where today&#x27;s central Calgary developed), became important gathering points for First Nations to exchange goods and celebrate festivities. Blackfoot Crossing was used by the Siksika as a winter campsite and is today a part of their reserve.

The fur trader James Gaddy and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company explorer David Thompson are traditionally considered to be the first people of European origin to see the Bow River. They camped along the Bow with a group of Piikani during the 1787–88 winter. 

Fur traders began to move to the Bow River region following Thompson&#x27;s expedition, but the river was not used extensively in the fur trade. First Nations already weakened by declining buffalo numbers and disease were further devastated by the introduction of the whisky trade. Fort Whoop-Up was established in 1869, and whisky traders were active along the Bow River during the 1870s. To stop these operations, the recently formed North-West Mounted Police (later the RCMP) established Fort Calgary in 1875 at the confluence of the Elbow River and the Bow.

In order to proceed with railway construction through present-day Alberta and an orderly settlement of the Bow region, the government sought to extinguish title of First Nations to specific lands, and negotiated to do so through treaties. With bison numbers declining and white settlers becoming increasingly common in the region, the Nakoda, Tsuu Tʼina, Kainai, Piikanai, and Siksika met with representatives of the Canadian government at Blackfoot Crossing on the Bow River and signed Treaty 7 on 22 September 1877, ceding lands in exchange for defined reserves. From the perspective of the Canadian government, these groups had surrendered all their land privileges outside their reserves. The reserves of the Nakoda, Tsuu Tʼina, and Siksika were established along the Bow River.

===Hydroelectric development, 1910–1960===
Calgary was growing rapidly after 1900. The city businessmen pressed for dam construction in order to generate cheaper power from hydroelectric sources. William Maxwell Aitken, later with R. B. Bennett, formed Calgary Power Company in 1910. That year, on property purchased from the Nakoda, Calgary Power began constructing Alberta&#x27;s first major hydroelectric plant, Horseshoe Dam.

Calgary Power had problems before this dam was completed in 1911. The Bow River originates from a northern mountain, and its flow varies considerably depending upon the amount and location of winter snowfalls. A comprehensive study of the Bow&#x27;s flow measurements had not been conducted. In its operations, Calgary Power relied upon estimates of the river&#x27;s minimum flow during winter conditions. Thus, despite the amount of energy the company had contracted, it could not reliably fulfill these obligations during winters. With capital already invested in Horseshoe, Calgary Power opened another hydroelectric plant and reservoir two years later at Kananaskis Falls just upstream from Horseshoe Falls. A storage reservoir was also created within Banff National Park in 1912 at Lake Minnewanka. Despite this additional reservoir and both plants, Calgary Power still struggled to fulfill its power contracts during winter months. In the 1920s, the company began planning new projects to control the Bow River.

The Bow River&#x27;s hydroelectric development both conforms to and contrasts with elements of conservationist ideology in the United States during this era. This ideology espoused that rational and planned resource development guided by technicians should benefit the greatest number of people possible. In this light, rivers could be seen as a series of interdependent parts, and engineering all of them could give technicians control over the system as a whole for the benefit of society.

In this process, Calgary Power ultimately fulfilled conservationist ideology as it increasingly brought the Bow River&#x27;s interdependent sectors, and thus it as a whole, under control, while failing to embody conservationist ideals of rationally developing the Bow initially. Also in line with conservationism, bureaucrats allowing the construction of the Minnewanka reservoir espoused that the nation&#x27;s development as a whole superseded the need to protect a small part of Banff National Park&#x27;s nature.

Calgary Power&#x27;s ad hoc hydroelectric development of the Bow continued. Ghost Dam was built in 1929; a major development on the Bow&#x27;s tributary, Spray River, was completed in 1951; and, at the behest of the provincial government, Bearspaw Dam was built in 1954 just west of Calgary to control flooding (the dam included a generating station) and 1955 saw the development of two reservoirs on the Kananaskis River in what is now Peter Lougheed Provincial Park World War II&#x27;s industrial demand increased pressure on the river: another hydroelectric development was built within Banff National Park, this time on the Cascade River, a tributary of the Bow.

Between 1910 and 1960, the Bow River was radically changed as it was systematically engineered to control its water flow and provide hydroelectric power. The seasonal summer flooding in Calgary was an issue of the past. Water was held by reservoirs during spring and summer, permitting steady power generation during fall and winter. Comparing 1924–33 to 1954–63, the Bow River&#x27;s January flow had approximately doubled 30 years later. Parts of the river, such as that preceding Ghost Dam, had practically turned into lakes. These developments had ecological effects, too. For example, reservoirs allowed certain fish species, such as the brown trout, to outcompete others, while other species virtually disappeared.

===Environmentalism===
By the 1950s, the Bow River&#x27;s south bank in Calgary was a generally derelict commercial zone. The Calgary Local Council of Women was the most vocal advocate for turning this area into a park system as a part of a broader campaign for improved public and social services. Calgary City Council agreed to the idea in 1955, but by 1959 little progress had been made to fund the project. To accommodate increasing traffic flow through the growing city, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the city began negotiating a CPR reroute that would follow the south bank of the Bow River, turning it into a parkway and the CPR&#x27;s rail mainline. Among the plan&#x27;s critics was the Local Council of Women, reminding the city of its 1955 promise for a river park. After negotiations between the CPR and Calgary ended in failure in 1964, urban elites, such as golf clubs, increasingly endorsed the Local Council of Women&#x27;s idea for a riverfront park system.

Park advocates defined the Bow River within Calgary as the city&#x27;s nature: it was something to be protected for and enjoyed by the public. However, as progress was made in the parks&#x27; creation, this &quot;environmental&quot; view of the Bow&#x27;s nature proved selective. For example, trees were not to be cut down, but landscaping to accommodate cyclists was endorsed. In short, the river was valued above all when it suited human goals. Calgary eventually developed an extensive plan for the Bow River&#x27;s park system, and it is considered an important element of Calgary&#x27;s self-image today.

The grassroots advocacy done by the Local Council of Women denotes emerging environmental sensibilities that are representative of larger trends occurring in North America during this period. Samuel Hays associated such movements with the emergence of an advanced consumer society. Unlike the pre-World War II elitist ideology of conservationist production, this emergent approach in North America was of grassroots consumers democratically engaging in environmental issues, and there was often tension between the public and managers of the environment.

After an Alberta Environment official discovered a toxic &quot;blob&quot; in the Bow in October 1989, human needs again were given priority. Originating from an abandoned wood-preserving plant on the Bow River&#x27;s bank, the &quot;blob&quot; in the river had released a carcinogenic plume that stretched more than downstream. Its discovery caused alarm in the media and amongst those living along the Bow River (two years earlier, 70 percent of Calgarians reported using the Bow recreationally).

As a result, Alberta&#x27;s premier, Ralph Klein, established the Bow River Water Quality Council as a provincial advisory body. The council was to promote awareness of the river&#x27;s water quality and try to improve it through fact-finding and aiding inter-institutional coordination. It was composed of representatives from diverse interests such as First Nations, agriculture, and municipalities. Recreational groups represented on the council, such as Ducks Unlimited and Bow Waters Canoe Club, expressed concern for the river&#x27;s environment. Their attitudes were not strictly human-centric, but, like those favoring a park system in Calgary, they defined the Bow River&#x27;s environment as something worth preserving for human use.

Greater changes in attitude toward the river were manifest in the Bow River Water Quality Council&#x27;s reports over time. By 1994, the reports emphasized the importance of the Bow&#x27;s ecological balance as a whole for maintaining its water quality and quantity. In the mid-1990s, the upper Bow River began being treated explicitly biocentrically. This was part of the larger pursuit of treating Banff National Park&#x27;s ecosystems as something intrinsically valuable: maintaining these ecosystems was now prioritized over human enjoyment of the parks.

===2013 floods===
In June 2013, southern Alberta had such heavy rainfall that catastrophic flooding occurred throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood and Oldman rivers and tributaries. A dozen municipalities declared local states of emergency on June 20 as water levels rose, and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders.

===Banff===

====Designation as a national park====
In 1887 the Canadian parliament, under the urging of the Canadian Pacific Railway vice-president, William Van Horne, and the federal land agent, William Pearce, created Rocky Mountains Park, later renamed &quot;Banff National Park&quot;. Originally , it was Canada&#x27;s first national park and included part of the Bow River. Eventually the park grew to include the Bow Glacier, an outflow of the Wapta Icefield and the source of the Bow River.

The designation of the national park marked a turning point in the public&#x27;s perception of the Bow River. The river began to be appreciated for its aesthetic value in addition to its industrial and agricultural uses. Officials of the Canadian Pacific Railway, the company who led the development of Banff, realized this element. When work began on a new luxury hotel in Banff in 1886–87, Van Horne personally redesigned and reoriented the plans so that the guests of the hotel would be able to see the vista of the Bow River. Many early postcards from Banff, as well as some current ones, prominently featured the Bow River.

====Sustainability as a national park====

From the 1920s forward, the National Parks of Canada began to focus on the economic benefits of accessible, mass marketable tourism. Changes included new highways and the creation of storage reservoirs for the water needed to sustain the burgeoning community. The Bow River was now seen both for its aesthetic qualities and for new utilitarian aspects.

By the 1950s Banff&#x27;s raw sewage began to be discharged into the Bow River. Because of the self-purification powers of the cold, braided water, however, the Bow was incredibly effective as a natural sewage-treatment facility. Tourists and residents were often unaware of the transformation of the Bow River into a sewage system.

As Banff continued to grow, the river continued to digest the increased volume of sewage. This practice, however, began to touch an ideological nerve among the tourists and residents of Banff. Pouring raw sewage into one of the main attractions of the park polluted both the river and, more importantly, the image of Banff. There was also fear that continued reliance on the Bow as a natural sewer would either cap the development of Banff or eventually have great risk to public health. By the 1960s, the town built a modern sewage facility and stopped releasing untreated waters into the Bow. The river&#x27;s aesthetic qualities had increasing priority in terms of effects of development within the borders of a National Park.

==Irrigation and development==
The Bow river contains seven dams and weirs on its main stream and ten other dams on its tributaries. In response to the 2013 Alberta floods a new reservoir storage is being proposed on the river. Three options are being considered including a new dam near Morley, an expanded Ghost Dam or a new dam near Glenbow.
The Bow River supplies the water for three irrigation districts in southern Alberta: the Eastern, Western, and Bow River irrigation districts.

===Eastern Irrigation District===
The Eastern Irrigation District (EID), headquartered in Brooks, Alberta, was originally part of land that the federal government granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway in lieu of a portion of the payment for the construction of the railway. In 1929 the CPR split the property into two parts and divested itself of both sections. In 1935 a delegation of irrigation farmers took control of the eastern section and established the EID.

The EID, diverting its water at the Bassano and Newell dams, is the largest private land owner in Alberta. Recently the EID began promoting the recreational possibilities that have developed alongside the district&#x27;s irrigation development. The EID currently owns and operates the Rolling Hills Reservoir Campground. In 1951, the Province of Alberta also established Kinbrook Island Provincial Park on the eastern bank of the Newell reservoir, which has been stocked with native species of fish.

===Western Irrigation District===
The Western Irrigation District (WID), headquartered in Strathmore, Alberta, was the second half of the land divested by the CPR. The WID was established in 1944.

The water of the WID, diverted at the Calgary Weir, is instrumental to southern Alberta agriculture and, unlike the other two districts, supports the urban needs city of Calgary. It is able to supply both agricultural and urban needs since the WID has higher levels of rainfall than the other two districts, and it receives much of Calgary&#x27;s storm water.

===Bow River Irrigation District===
The Bow River Irrigation District (BRID), headquartered in Vauxhall, Alberta, was created in 1968, making it the most recent district to be supplied by the Bow. The BRID diverts the Bow at the Carseland weir and also uses the McGregor, Travers, and Little Bow dams. Each has a reservoir that is also used for recreational purposes.

In March 2012, the citizens of the BRID voted in favour of expanding the area of the district by . An expansion of passed in 2004 as well. This means that, for the second time in eight years, the BRID will increase its demand on the Bow River by roughly 10 percent.

===Irrigation today===
Of the 45 crops that are grown in the Bow River basin, only 10 could be produced without irrigation.

Because of the dependence of the region on Bow River irrigation water, in the early 21st century all three irrigation districts began to make major changes in order to continue to serve their large mandated areas. In 2006, as a part of the &quot;Water for Life Initiative&quot;, the Alberta government placed a moratorium on any new licenses for water use from the Bow, Oldman, and South Saskatchewan River basins. The government also requested that the three irrigation districts increase their efficiency by 30 percent. The irrigation districts are improving their irrigation system by changing most canals to pipelines in order to decrease contamination, spillage, and loss of water to evaporation. A drawback of this change is that trees must be cleared in order to prevent roots from damaging the pipeline, changing the habitat.

in 1987 the EID in association with the Alberta Fish and Wildlife Division and Ducks Unlimited Canada established a partnership to create additional wildlife habitat within the Eastern Irrigation District&#x27;s boundaries. This demonstrated the EID&#x27;s goal of encouraging wildlife in order to contribute to the growth of its tourist sector. Hunting and fishing are now promoted on the EID&#x27;s website.

==Recreation==
The Bow River provides habitat for wildlife and many opportunities for recreation such as fishing and boating. Both fly fishermen and spinner fishermen share the river in all four seasons of the year. Serious anglers from all over the world visit the Bow River for its thriving population of brown trout and rainbow trout. The Bow River holds a resident population of rainbow and brown trout that has one of the best growth rates to be found on any river system in the world today. A trout that is 4 to 5 years old will be around long, and the Bow River holds many fish that are this size or larger. Mainly the river is fished south of the city of Calgary, past where the water treatment sites dump into the river. The volume of nutrients and number of fish are higher there.

Outdoor adventurers use primarily three types of boats to enjoy the river, the inflatable boat, the Jon boat and the canoe. There are several spots on the river to launch watercraft, including Graves Landing, Highway 22X Bridge, Policeman&#x27;s Flats and McKinnon Flats.

The Bow River pathway, is developed on both banks of the river throughout the city of Calgary and is used for cycling, hiking, jogging, as well as rollerblading and skateboarding. Along the Bow River pathway, many people partake in canoeing, kayaking, rafting, paddle boarding, and other activities on the water. Dog owners and families often use the river banks and beaches for outdoor recreation.

===Recreation and industrial development===
The recreation and tourism sector of the Bow developed closely alongside the river&#x27;s water irrigation projects. Projects such as the McGregor, Chestermere, and Ghost dams were originally built for either agricultural or electrical purposes but are also important for the recreational facilities they offer. Since their construction, the dams along the Bow River have played a central role in the development of the adjacent communities.

Two key examples that demonstrate the connection of recreation and tourism with irrigation are the Chestermere and Basano dams. Following the construction of the Chestermere Dam in 1907, housing developments began to occur around the neighbouring lake and in 1992, because of these developments, Chestermere was declared a town. Similarity, after a three-year refurbishing project ending in 1987, the town of Bassano, about northeast of the dam, began advertising the Bassano dam as a tourist attraction for the town. At this point the Bassano dam now also started offering group tours, fishing and picnic areas, and a scenic viewpoint.

Communities have also recently begun to appear around Ghost Dam as well.

===Calgary&#x27;s weir project (Harvie Passage)===
In 1904 the Bow River Weir was constructed close to Calgary&#x27;s downtown core in order to divert water into the Western Irrigation District. Since its construction a side effect of the weir had been that it created a circulating wave, with a lethal and powerful undertow, immediately downstream of it. Because rafting, canoeing, and kayaking down the Bow River are such popular summer activities, there had been many fatalities. Furthermore, because fish were not able to pass through the structure, they too became trapped in the circulating wave and a dense, unnatural concentration of pelicans congregated immediately following the weir.

In order to combat the circulating wave and undertow, in August 2007 the Province of Alberta through the Alberta Lottery fund, in conjunction with the Calgary Foundation and the City of Calgary, began construction of the Bow River Weir paddle around, named the Harvie Passage. The passage allowed for the wave to be dispersed over a set of several smaller rapids while still supplying water to its irrigation district. Altogether, the paddle around cost $18 million and was completed in the spring of 2012.

In June 2013, just a year after the project was completed, Calgary was hit with an epic 100 year flood, and all of the Harvie Passage work was destroyed. After that flood, the passage was closed to the public and a safety boom ahead of the rapids was re-installed. It was estimated that rebuilding the Harvie Passage to the original intent of the project (completed in 2012) would cost $23.4 million.

By 2021, construction on the Harvie Passage was complete. The passage was redesigned to withstand a flood similar to the one that damaged the previous structures.

==Ecology==
An invasive species known as Didymosphenia geminata, a type of algae commonly called &quot;rock snot&quot;, is threatening the stocked exotic invasive brown trout stocks.

<doc id="565141" wikidata="Q585266" url="?curid=565141" title="Jón Páll Sigmarsson">
<text>Jón Páll Sigmarsson (28 April 1960 – 16 January 1993) was an Icelandic strongman, powerlifter and bodybuilder who was the first man to win the World&#x27;s Strongest Man four times and the first and only man to win the World Muscle Power Classic five times.

Jón Páll is widely regarded as one of the greatest strength athletes all time, and is credited with developing Iceland&#x27;s strength identity. He also set over 25 strength related world records, was named Icelandic Sportsperson of the Year in 1981, and was posthumously inducted into the World&#x27;s Strongest Man Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
Jón Páll was born in Hafnarfjörður on 28 April 1960, weighing and measuring . He was the first child of Dóra Jónsdóttir and Sigmar Jónsson. He was raised by his mother and foster father Sveinn Guðmundsson. The family moved to Stykkishólmur when he was two. He remained there until the age of nine, when the family relocated to Reykjavík.

Growing up, he spent his summers on Skáleyjar and was active as a farmhand. He worked from dawn until dusk, carrying pails of water and assisting his foster father on seal hunts. He took up Glima, a traditional Icelandic form of wrestling at the age of five and later played a vast array of sports such as football, handball, gymnastics, karate, swimming and middle-distance running.

==Career==
Jón Páll was introduced to weight lifting in 1976, and began training at the &#x27;Jakaból&#x27; gym in 1978. The same year he won the Icelandic junior bodybuilding title in the +90 kg. class. His was also showing great numbers in powerlifting, including Icelandic national records in the bench press (with , , and ) and the squat (with , , and ), but his best performances were usually in the deadlift event, in which he set the European record many times (with , , , and ). The Icelandic phrase &quot; &#x27;Þetta er ekkert mál fyrir Jón Páll!&#x27; &quot; was often yelled by him during deadlifting. While continuously winning bodybuilding competitions, he did his first strongman competition in 1982.

===1983-1985===
Jón Páll was invited to the World&#x27;s Strongest Man for the first time in 1983, in which he emerged runner-up to Geoff Capes by one and a half points. He showcased him immense strength by performing a silver dollar deadlift. He also emerged third at the Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man. The following year, at age 24, he defeated Capes by 6 points and won 1984 World&#x27;s Strongest Man in Mora, Sweden, becoming the youngest person to ever win the World&#x27;s Strongest Man; a record which he holds to-date. Soon after the final armwrestling event, Jón Páll famously shouted &quot;The King has lost his crown!&quot; He won three events (truck pull, caber toss and rock press) and came second in four events in the process.

In 1985 Jón Páll lost the title to Capes, again by only one and a half points. During the deadlift event, a spectator in the audience yelled &#x27;Eskimo&#x27; to Jón Páll, and he famously yelled back: &quot;I am not an Eskimo, I&#x27;m a Viking!&quot; and successfully lifted the cart. In 1985 Jón Páll won Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man and also won both the inaugural World Muscle Power Classic and inaugural Iceland&#x27;s Strongest Man. During one of the events in Iceland&#x27;s Strongest Man, he famously danced while carrying the Húsafell Stone.

===1986-1987===
In 1986 World&#x27;s Strongest Man in Nice, France, Jón Páll won his second title, beating Capes by 4 points. He won four events (carry &amp; drag, McGlashen stones, deadlift and the loading race) and came second in three events in the process. Also in 1986, Jón Páll won World Muscle Power Classic, Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man and Commonwealth Highland Games. In the same year, he wrestled English author and Guinness World Record holder Brian Sterling-Vete in an exhibition match for the TV news and print media held at Finnur Karlsson&#x27;s gymnasium in Reykjavík, Iceland.

In 1987, began Jón Páll&#x27;s rivalry with Bill Kazmaier who returned to strength sports following his ban from World&#x27;s Strongest Man after 1982. Kazmaier boasted some of the heaviest powerlifting lifts of that time and had made his reputation in the 1980s as &quot;the strongest man who ever lived&quot; by breaking numerous strongman world records. In 1987, World&#x27;s Strongest Man was not held for the first and only time in its history. However, 3x times champion Kazmaier, 2x times champion Capes and then 2x times champion Jón Páll met at 1987 Pure Strength, a vintage competition held in the grounds of Huntly Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland to determine who is the strongest man on Earth. Jón Páll who turned in at his all-time heaviest bodyweight dominated the competition, winning 8 out of 10 events while breaking multiple world records in the process. A legendary quote, &quot;There is no reason to be alive, if you can&#x27;t do deadlift!&quot; was shouted by Jón Páll at the top of the rectangular-handled cartwheel deadlift during the competition. He won the event with a world record lift of . He also managed to break the log lift world record with .

===1988-1990===
In 1988 Capes retired, and at the 1988 World&#x27;s Strongest Man Jón Páll and Kazmaier clashed again. Kazmaier won the deadlift, log lift and sack race but Jón Páll won the Weight over bar with a five-point lead and McGlashen Stones in the end to secure the overall victory, equaling Kazmaier&#x27;s record for three World&#x27;s Strongest Man titles. After his victory Jón Páll said: &quot;I may be the fastest strongman in the world, but I think Bill is the strongest on his feet&quot;. The same year, Jón Páll won the Icelandic Bodybuilding championship in +90 kg class.

In 1989 Jón Páll won the World Muscle Power Classic but placed third both at the 1989 World&#x27;s Strongest Man and Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man.

In 1990, Jón Páll came to the 1990 World&#x27;s Strongest Man injured, but after a valiant fight, won the title for a record breaking fourth time. The American O.D. Wilson who was leading the competition with a comfortable five and a half points leading up to the last event (a 200 m race with a 100 kg weight on the back) lacked the endurance to complete the course quickly enough, giving up six points to Jón Páll, earning him the win at the final event. He also won World Muscle Power Classic and Iceland&#x27;s Strongest Man.

===1991-1992===
In 1991 Jón Páll won his fifth World Muscle Power Classic, but badly injured his left arm during Nordic Strongest Man in Denmark. He underwent an operation at a hospital in Scotland but the bones of his forearm grew together, which prevented the full use of his arm thereafter. In 1992 won his fifth Iceland&#x27;s Strongest Man title as well as Finland&#x27;s Strongest Man. Both in 1991 and 1992 he missed the World&#x27;s Strongest Man due to recurring injuries.

====Rivalry with Kazmaier====
Jón Páll was often challenged by Kazmaier in static feats of strength because he believed events were biased in Jón Páll&#x27;s favour. Despite battling with injuries, Jón Páll&#x27;s mobility reduced but it progressively translated into improved brute strength. In 1981 when Kazmaier traveled to Nigeria for a Highland games style strength exhibition with Douglas Edmunds, he attempted to break his own deadlift world record by pulling with straps. He was successful, however it was not considered an official record since it was a slightly elevated deadlift. During his preparation for 1987 Pure Strength, Jón Páll replicated the same setup and pulled in his gym &#x27;Gym 80&#x27; in front of many Icelandic spectators.

==Personal life and death==
Although he was known for his energetic, charismatic and boastful personality when competing, Jón Páll was known for his vibrant personality, humor and soft-spoken nature in his personal life. He was also an avid reader and enjoyed reading to his son Sigmar Freyr (born 1983).

On 16 January 1993, Jón Páll died of an aortic rupture while deadlifting in his gym &#x27;Gym 80&#x27; in Reykjavík. It was the result of a congenital heart defect that also affected three other members of his family which may have also been exacerbated by his use of anabolic steroids. Jón Páll had sought medical treatment in the United States in 1992 due to persisting heart problems. In Sölvi Tryggvason&#x27;s 2013 biography of Jón Páll, he stated he suspected Jón Páll knew he was close to death.

Jón Páll is buried at the Lágafell church cemetery.

==Legacy==
Jón Páll was described in his life documentary &quot;Larger than Life&quot; by Geoff Capes as &quot;a new kind of guy on the block&quot; and by David P. Webster equally in describing him as a man who boasted pure static strength as well as versatile athletic strength in all its forms, a combination that lead to his supreme performances. World&#x27;s Strongest Man Director Colin Bryce called Jón Páll the greatest strongman of all time for not only his titles but also showmanship, stating &quot;&quot;Strongman is entertainment. None of us would be here without Jón Páll&quot;.&quot;

Jón Páll&#x27;s lifelong friend and training partner Hjalti Árnason created the Jón Páll Sigmarsson Classic international strongman contest in 2010 in honor of Jón Páll. The event was held annually for three consecutive years during the Icelandic fitness &amp; health expo in Reykjavík. The inaugural winner was America&#x27;s Brian Shaw and the final winner was Iceland&#x27;s own Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson. Hafþór also has a tattoo of Jón Páll lifting a natural stone in one of his calves.

In New Hampshire, United States, there is a popular lifting stone weighing named after Jón Páll which is used in some New England Highland Games. One of his legendary quotes &quot; &#x27;Þetta er ekkert mál fyrir Jón Páll!&#x27; &quot; is inscribed in the stone.

<doc id="565142" wikidata="Q647927" url="?curid=565142" title="Jæren">
<text>Jæren is a traditional district in Rogaland county, Norway. The other districts in Rogaland are Dalane, Ryfylke, and Haugalandet. Jæren is one of the 15 districts that comprise Western Norway.

At about , Jæren is the largest flat lowland area in Norway, stretching from the municipality of Randaberg in the north to Hå in the south. It includes the whole Stavanger Peninsula and the mainland area at its base. The coast is flat compared to the rest of the mountainous Norwegian coast, and it has sandy beaches along most of the coastline. The largest urban area in Jæren is the adjoining cities of Stavanger/Sandnes (pop. 210,874 in 2015).

==Economy==
The petroleum industry around Stavanger is an important part of the economy of Jæren, with the headquarters of the country&#x27;s largest oil company Equinor being located in Jæren, as well regional offices of international companies like ExxonMobil, Eni, Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP, Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, and several others. Jæren is also one of the most important agricultural areas of Norway, with a long crop period and varied and well-developed livestock production. Industry here is also strongly connected to the farming industry, with one of the largest producers of agricultural machines in the world, Kverneland Group, located in Time and Klepp.

==Name==
The Old Norse form of the name was . The name is identical with the word which means &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;brim&quot;. Several farms in Norway (around 30) have the same name. The name refers to the 60 km long coastline stretching from Brusand in the south to Tungenes in the north.

==Location==
Jæren is the largest flat lowland area in Norway. It comprises the coastline from the Stavanger Peninsula near the mouth of the great Boknafjorden all the way, south nearly to Egersund. Unlike most of the Norwegian coastline, there are very few offshore islands and few fjords cutting into the shoreline. Jærens rev (Jæren&#x27;s reef) is a partly stony sandbar which extends almost 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) to the west in front of the Revtangen headland in Klepp municipality, the westernmost point of Jæren.

===Municipalities===
The geographical region of Jæren has eight municipalities:

===Alternate descriptions===
The geographical region of Jæren constitutes the above-mentioned municipalities, but the description of Jæren varies. Legally speaking, the Jæren District Court constitutes only the municipalities of Sandnes, Gjesdal, Forsand, Klepp, Time, and Hå. Some areas not traditionally in the area included in the district, and other areas are part of the Stavanger District Court.

Religiously speaking, the Jæren deanery constitutes the churches in the municipalities of Hå, Klepp, Time, and Gjesdal. Geographically speaking, the municipality of Gjesdal lies in the transition between Jæren and Dalane districts, but it is traditionally considered to be part of Jæren.

Confusion over the extent of the district is added by the fact that in everyday language, the name &quot;Jæren&quot; for most people does not include the towns of Stavanger and Sandnes but only the more rural area to the south.

<text>Siphoviridae was a family of double-stranded DNA viruses in the order &quot;Caudovirales&quot;. The family &quot;Siphoviridae&quot; and order &quot;Caudovirales&quot; have now been abolished, with the term siphovirus now used to refer to the morphology of viruses in this former family. Bacteria and archaea serve as natural hosts. The family had 1,166 species, assigned to 366 genera and 22 subfamilies. The characteristic structural features are a non-enveloped head and non-contractile tail.

==Structure==

Viruses in the former family &quot;Siphoviridae&quot; are non-enveloped, with icosahedral and head-tail geometries (morphotype B1) or a prolate capsid (morphotype B2), and T=7 symmetry. Their diameters are around 60 nm. Members of this family are also characterized by their filamentous, cross-banded, non-contractile tails, usually with short terminal and subterminal fibers. Genomes are double stranded and linear, around 50 kb in length, containing about 70 genes. The guanine/cytosine content is usually around 52%.

==Life cycle==
Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by adsorption into the host cell. Replication follows the replicative transposition model. DNA-templated transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by -1 ribosomal frameshifting, and +1 ribosomal frameshifting. The virus exits the host cell by lysis, and holin, endolysin, or spanin proteins. Bacteria and archaea serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are passive diffusion.

<doc id="565145" wikidata="Q7686640" url="?curid=565145" title="Tarragon Theatre">
<text>The Tarragon Theatre is a theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and one of the main centers for contemporary playwriting in the country. Located near Casa Loma, the theatre was founded by Bill and Jane Glassco in 1970. Bill Glassco was the artistic director from 1971 to 1982. In 1982, Urjo Kareda took over as artistic director and remained in that role until his death in December 2001. Richard Rose was appointed artistic director in July 2002. Mike Payette assumed the role of artistic director in September 2021 upon Rose&#x27;s retirement, with Lisa Li joining as Executive Director in June 2024.

In 1987, Tarragon purchased and renovated the building that has been its home since 1971. There are two performance spaces: the Mainspace (205 seats), and The Extra Space (113 seats).

Tarragon is well known for its development, creation and encouragement of new work. Over 170 works have premiered at Tarragon. Playwrights who have premiered their work here include Morwyn Brebner, David French, Michael Healey, Joan MacLeod, Morris Panych, James Reaney, Jason Sherman, Brendan Gall, Hannah Moscovitch, Ellie Moon and Judith Thompson.

==Background==
The theatre is housed in a building originally designed for light industrial use, including as a cribbage board factory. It cost $9,000 to renovate.

The company&#x27;s first production was David Freeman&#x27;s &quot;Creeps&quot;.

Tarragon has championed the work of Canadian playwrights David French, Michel Tremblay, Judith Thompson, Jason Sherman, George F. Walker, Morris Panych, Carole Frechette, Michael Healey, Daniel MacIvor, Hannah Moscovitch, Wajdi Mouawad and others, as well as productions of plays by canonical playwrights such as Anton Chekhov and August Strindberg.

Urjo Kareda founded the theatre&#x27;s Playwrights Unit in 1982.

The Spring Arts Fair showcased works in progress, including an early version of Ted Dykstra and Richard Greenblatt&#x27;s &quot;2 Pianos, 4 Hands&quot;, which later toured around the world.

The theatre holds two performances venues, containing approximately 200 and 100 seats respectively. One of the rehearsal halls can be used as a performance area, seating 60.

The 2020–21 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and productions were moved online, including audio recordings of plays available through a CBC podcast.

It remains one of the foremost organizations for producing new plays in Canada. The company has received numerous awards including Governor General&#x27;s Awards, Dora Mavor Moore Awards and the Premier&#x27;s Award for Excellence in the Arts. The company&#x27;s archives are held at the University of Guelph.

<text>Downsview is a neighbourhood in the north end of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located in the district of North York. The area takes its name from the Downs View farm established around 1842 near the present-day intersection of Keele Street and Wilson Avenue. It now extends beyond the intersection of Sheppard Avenue and Dufferin Street (the latter which is bypassed by Allen Road in the vicinity of the intersection), though it is popularly seen as including the areas to the north right up to the Toronto city limit at Steeles Avenue. The area includes several large post-World War II subdivisions. Within the area is Downsview Airport, the former site of Canadian Forces Base Downsview, which has since been largely converted following the end of the Cold War into an urban park known as Downsview Park. The airport is still used as a manufacturing and testing facility for Bombardier Aerospace. As of the 2021 census, the Downsview-Roding-CFB neighbourhood was split into the two neighbourhoods of Downsview (east of Roding Street west of Allan Road and between Sheppard Avenue and Highway 401) and Oakdale–Beverley Heights (west of Roding Street east of the CP Rail line just west of Highway 400 also between Sheppard Avenue and Highway 401).

==Description==

From the east side of Dufferin Street to areas to the east, the area is primarily residential, while to the west, the district is industrial. In the western section is the large Downsview Park district which has served as a military base but is now being redeveloped into parkland and mixed uses. West of Downsview Park, are several residential subdivisions. Most of the houses in Downsview were built immediately post-war and into the 1960s, though some houses and condos have been recently built near Sheppard West station. North of Downsview Park is a large industrial-commercial area.

Immediately beside Dufferin Street, William R. Allen Road brings large traffic volumes from the Ontario Highway 401 exit to the south. The main arterial streets are Sheppard Avenue and Wilson Avenue running east–west and Keele Street and Jane Street running north–south. The major streets have retail businesses along the frontage and the businesses along Wilson Avenue south of Downsview Park have organized the Wilson Village BIA. There is a large &quot;big box&quot; retail area south of Wilson between Dufferin Street and Allen Road.

==History==
The area is named for the farm settled by Justice of the Peace John Perkins Bull called &quot;Downs View&quot; in 1842 near Keele Street and Rustic Road, then in York County, Upper Canada. For over a century, the area was an agricultural community with a post office, schoolhouse, and general store. The centre of the community was the Downsview Methodist Church (now Downsview United Church) on Keele Street, which was erected in 1870 and designated a Toronto Heritage Property in 2008. Other historical landmarks from this period include The George Jackson House, which was also designated heritage property. In 1850, the area became part of York Township, and in 1927, became part of North York Township, which eventually became the City of North York. In 1998, the area became part of the city of Toronto.

In April 1929, William De Havilland bought of farmland to build a manufacturing facility for De Havilland Canada. The facility was expanded during the 1930s and particularly during the Second World War, and became Canada&#x27;s largest supplier of military, civilian and government-owned aircraft, as well as the site of several aviation firsts and record-breaking flights. In the early Cold War period, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) built up the area as a major air station and logistics support base. In 1954, the RCAF built a large supply depot that served as the central stores for the RCAF. The building currently houses the Downsview Park Merchant&#x27;s Market.

In the 1950s, the Ontario provincial government developed the Downsview Complex, which currently houses a number of provincial offices, as well as a detachment from the Ontario Provincial Police. In 1969, a large residential complex of five 19-storey high apartment buildings, known as Jane-Exbury Towers, was completed in 1969. Designed by architect Uno Prii, they are noted for their mid-century expressionist features.

The military base and the de Havilland company, including the runway and all buildings, was closed and sold to Bombardier Aerospace in 1994. Bombardier has been manufacturing and testing commercial aircraft on the site since then. Some 1000 de Havilland DH 98 Mosquito aircraft were built by the company at Downsview during the Second World War.

On August 10, 2008, just before 4 a.m., massive explosions occurred at the Sunrise Propane Industrial Gases propane facility, at 54 Murray Rd., located immediately north-east of the intersection of Keele Street and Wilson Avenue. An employee of the facility and a firefighter were killed as a result of the explosions. Mayor David Miller had publicly expressed his condolences to the families of the victims shortly thereafter.

Redevelopment of the Downsview Complex began in 2011. The redevelopment of the complex saw the completion of the Humber River Hospital, which was opened in 2015. The acute care hospital is situated on Wilson Avenue and Keele Street.

CSCM and CSV students attend schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

The neighbourhood is also home to Centennial College&#x27;s Downsview Aerospace campus. The college is a post-secondary institution, with several campuses throughout Toronto.

==Recreation==

Several municipal parks are situated in Downsview, including Chalkfarm Park, Downsview Dells Park, Oakdale Village Park, and Roding Park. Roding Park is an park near Wilson Avenue and Keele Street. Recreational facilities in the park include a baseball diamond, two tennis courts, four bocce courts and a children&#x27;s playground. Downsview Dells Park is a large park which features wilderness and wetland settings with picnic areas and fire pits. Car parking and washrooms are available within the park. Within the park is Downsview Dells House, a municipal drug and alcohol treatment facility. A number of these parks are situated near the valley of the Black Creek, as it flows south and west from Sheppard Avenue midway between Keele and Jane Streets. The valley forms a part of the larger Toronto ravine system.

Municipal parks in Downsview are maintained by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. In addition to parks, the division also operates several community centres in the neighbourhood, including Ancaster Community Centre, Chalkfarm Community Centre, and Roding Community Centre. The Toronto Public Library operates two branches in the neighbourhood, Black Creek branch, and Downsview branch.

The Government of Canada also maintains an urban park in the neighbourhood, known as Downsview Park. The park was formerly used by the Canadian Armed Forces, as CFB Toronto. The park houses several recreational facilities, including practice facilities for the Toronto FC. Downsview Park has also hosted several large public events, including a Papal Mass, attended by 800,000 people on 28 July 2002. The mass was led by Pope John Paul II for World Youth Day. On 30 July 2003, the park also hosted a massive concert known as Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto. The concert was held in support of the City of Toronto after the 2003 SARS outbreak there.

==Transportation==

Several major roadways serve as the boundary for Downsview, with Sheppard Avenue to the north, Allen Road to the east, Highway 401 to the south, and Highway 400 to the west. The latter two roadways are major controlled access highways that form a part of the province&#x27;s 400-series highways network. Portions of Allen Road adjacent to Downsview also operate as a controlled access highway, although it is maintained by the City of Toronto, and not the provincial government. Other major thoroughfares in the neighbourhood include Keele Street, a major north–south roadway that runs through Downsview.

Public transportation in Downsview is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TTC operates several bus routes through the neighbourhood, as well as the Toronto subway. Line 1 of the subway system has two stops in the neighbourhood, Wilson station and Downsview Park station. Another stop on Line 1, Sheppard West station, is situated adjacent of the neighbourhood, on the eastern side of Allen Road. Regional train service by GO Transit stops at the Downsview Park Station.

<doc id="565168" wikidata="Q3497349" url="?curid=565168" title="Mont Tremblant Resort">
<text>Mont Tremblant Ski Resort (commonly referred to as Tremblant) is a year-round resort in the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec, Canada, located about northwest of Montreal. It is best known as a ski destination, but also features Lake Tremblant suitable for swimming and two golf courses in the summer months. The name of the mountain, Mont Tremblant, was derived from the Algonquin indigenous people, who called it the &quot;trembling mountain.&quot; The summit is at an elevation of , which makes it one of the tallest peaks in the Laurentians. One km north of the principal down hill area is the Edge, an area of glade skiing and north of that is the true summit, Pic Johanssen (), which has a trail over the top and is Black Diamond for skiers and boarders. The resort is owned by Alterra Mountain Company.

The mountain and resort are part of the Mont-Tremblant National Park and are both located near the village of Mont-Tremblant.

Mont Tremblant Ski Resort has consistently been ranked the #1 ski resort in Eastern North America with a ski area of over 654 acres.

==History==
Joseph Bondurant Ryan, an explorer from a wealthy American family from Philadelphia, came to the region prospecting gold in 1938. Accompanied by Harry Wheeler (founder of the Gray Rocks Inn in Mont Tremblant) and Lowell Thomas, an American journalist, they climbed to the summit of Mont Tremblant with skis wrapped in seal skins for traction. After an exhausting trek to the summit, it is said that Joseph Ryan vowed to transform the landscape into a world-class alpine village. Only one year later, his dream was realized. On February 12, 1939, Joseph Ryan opened the Mont Tremblant Lodge, which remains part of the pedestrian village today.

In its early years, Lowell Thomas, the American radio broadcaster, was an avid skier who helped popularize the resort by broadcasting shows from the site, thereby establishing the resort as a prime destination for skiers. The resort named a triple ski lift, which is located on the north mountainside, and trails after him as well as other early devotees.

Following the sudden death of Joseph Bondurant Ryan in 1950, the Mont Tremblant ski resort was operated by his wife Mary Rutherfoord Johnson Ryan until 1965, when it was sold to local Quebec entrepreneurs led by André Charron. They ran the resort until 1979, when they sold it to La Société des Caisses d&#x27;Entraide Économique. They ran the resort for four years until it went into bankruptcy. The resort was then bought in 1983 by Louis-Pierre Lapointe, who in turn sold it in 1991 to Intrawest.

Intrawest immediately expanded the pedestrian resort village with architecture reminiscent of traditional Quebec and built new ski lifts, including a gondola. Other changes included building the Grand Manitou summit lodge. In 2009, a casino located at the base of the Soleil trails was opened. The casino is serviced by an 8-passenger gondola that runs from the main resort to the casino.

Joseph Bondurant Ryan is buried next to the St. Bernard Chapel that he built in 1940-41 at the base of the alpine village, along with his wife Mary and son Peter Ryan, who died in Paris in 1962 at the age of 22 as a result of an auto racing accident. Peter Ryan was an accomplished champion skier who had been named to the Canadian Olympic ski team, but he had switched to auto racing after a 1959 skiing accident. He quickly showed tremendous talent in auto racing, and he was the first Canadian in Formula One racing and the winner of the first Canadian Grand Prix held at Mosport in 1961.

On March 16, 2009, actress Natasha Richardson sustained a head injury when she fell while taking a beginner skiing lesson at the resort. She died two days later in New York City.

Since Alterra took ownership of the resort in 2018, the resort has seen some major investments. During the summer of 2018, the Manitou Chalet located at the top of the mountain received significant improvements. For the winter of 2018-2019, a new high-speed quad ski lift was installed to replace the old Lowell Thomas Lift. The total number of trails is now 102, with several new glade areas. Alterra has already announced another $14 million investment for the 2019-2020 season. New developments will also be taking place on the Soleil Side, including a new hotel.

For the 2023/24 winter season, the resort is integrating Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) for ski gate access.

== Lifts ==
==Resort facilities==

The resort is located within Mont-Tremblant National Park, a Quebec provincial park in the Laurentian Mountains. The top of the mountain has a chalet and cafeteria, Le Grand Manitou, open winter and summer.

===Pedestrian village===
An open-air gondola called the Cabriolet connects the upper and lower parts of the pedestrian village. From the top of this lift, the main gondola is available to take skiers to the summit of the mountain. There is also a ski trail running through the village for skiers to access the lower level of the village and transportation.

The Mont Tremblant Resort also has extensive shopping for ski and snowboard enthusiasts. The municipal village of Mont-Tremblant is distant.

====Lodging====
Mont Tremblant has a wide variety of hotel and condo accommodations, many of which are situated in the pedestrian village at the foot of the mountain. There are additional condo and chalet accommodations located adjacent to the pedestrian village which are managed by the resort&#x27;s rental agency or other private rental agencies. These accommodations feature shuttle bus service which provides guests some of the same convenience afforded to people staying in the pedestrian village.

Most condo accommodations at the resort area are privately owned. The resort or rental agencies act as a rental broker for these properties by handling maintenance, reservations and other guest-related tasks on behalf of owners. There are also many privately owned chalets of all levels (from budget to luxury) in the immediate area.

===Sporting areas and facilities===
Mont Tremblant has year-round activities which take advantage of the surrounding environment (mountains, forest, lakes and rivers); most are set up on daily schedules and usually take the form of tours in small groups and are accessible to families; most are run by independent operators or specialized guides.

Summer activities include, all-terrain vehicle tours, croisieres, boating, canoeing trips, cycling, dune buggy tours, fishing tours, golf, tennis, helicopter tours, hiking, horse back riding, lake cruises, mountain biking, paintball games, rafting, rock climbing school, spas, via ferrata, waterskiing and wakeboarding, white-water rafting, and zip-lines.

Winter activities include cross-country skiing, dogsledding, downhill skiing and ski schools, helicopter tours, ice-climbing, ice fishing, ice skating, paintball, sleigh rides, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, tubing, spas and via ferrata.

====Skiing and snowboarding====

The main resort has more than of ski and snowboarding trails in four distinct areas: North Side (Versant Nord), South Side (Versant Sud), Sunny Side (Versant Soleil) and The Edge (Versant Edge). Since the 2018-2019 winter season, the resort has 102 ski trails. Of those trails, 22 are labelled easy, 34 intermediate, 42 difficult and 15 expert. There are three snow parks and twenty official glades.

The resort features 14 lifts, consisting of 3 gondolas (including the open-air gondola in the pedestrian village, the Cabriolet, the Télécabine Casino Express — connecting the South base to the Versant Soleil and Mont-Tremblant&#x27;s casino —, and the Tremblant Express, a top-to-bottom gondola), 6 detachable quadruple chairlifts, 2 fixed chairlifts, and 3 magic carpets. An open-air gondola, or cabriolet lift, is used to transport skiers above the village from the parking lot to the bottom of the mountain. The lifts have a total capacity of 27,830 skiers per hour.

==Surrounding area==

The surrounding hills and valleys are filled with trails for cross-country skiing and hiking. The ski trails connect with other ski trails in neighboring towns, making it possible for nature lovers to undertake ski excursions lasting several days going (or coming from) as far south as Blainville, Quebec on the outskirts of Montreal. The network of cross-country ski trails consists of over 100 km of terrain, much of which follows the Devil&#x27;s river and its adjacent coniferous forest.

The surrounding valleys of the Mont-Tremblant National Park have small lakes, dense boreal forests and thousands of vacation cottages. There are also world-class golf courses, hiking trails and small rivers suitable for canoeing and swimming.

There are some trails for mountain bikes and a special &quot;route verte&quot; rail trail paved for road bicycle use. The cycling/multifunctional path was built on an abandoned right-of-way of the Montreal-Mont Laurier railway; so cyclists do not have to share a path with motorized vehicles.

<text>Hustle is a British crime drama television series starring Adrian Lester, Robert Glenister and Robert Vaughn. Created by Tony Jordan, it was produced by Kudos Film and Television, and broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom. The show premiered on 24 February 2004, and ran for eight series, with its final episode aired on 17 February 2012. The show&#x27;s premise is on a group of con artists who specialise in &quot;long cons&quot; – extended forms of deceptive frauds that require greater commitment, but offer higher rewards than simple confidence tricks. The show&#x27;s most notable qualities are plots that involve behind-the-scenes action that the viewers are unaware of until near the end of an episode, along with fantasy scenes and occasional breaches of the fourth wall by the main actors.

The show achieved consistently high viewing figures throughout its eight-year run and was received favourably by critics.

==Premise==

Each episode&#x27;s plot focuses on a team of grifters who conduct the art of the &quot;long con&quot;, often targeting a &quot;mark&quot; whose activities are immoral and/or illegal, or whose character retains a fundamental negative personality with others they dislike, or who they make suffer, while adhering to the credo that &quot;you can&#x27;t cheat an honest man&quot;. Although con artists, the team display a moral, honourable code within their team, which include sometimes helping others who have been victims of their mark, often with anonymous financial compensation to them, and never stealing anything that doesn&#x27;t belong to them, instead borrowing them for the con and then returning them afterwards. For each mark, the team focuses on background research to uncover any issues they may face, as well as a weakness in the mark that they can exploit, such as a passion for something, or an issue they are facing. Once they have a plan, the team set up a scenario, employ a &quot;convincer&quot; to rope in their mark, and then hit them with the sting in which they take them for a sizeable amount of cash, within the tens of thousands, before conducting a &quot;blow-off&quot; to ensure the mark will not come after them, either because they won&#x27;t if they have to admit to conducting something illegal, or because the team has convinced them it will be impossible to do so.

==Characters==

* Michael &quot;Mickey Bricks&quot; Stone (Adrian Lester – Series 1–3, 5–8) – the lead &#x27;inside man&#x27;, Mickey is an ambitious and intelligent conman, known for being a world-renowned long-con expert with a careful eye for detail and ensuring that every part of his plan is covered, including a back-up plan for when things go wrong. While smart, his success has given him a considerable ego that he is unbeatable, while he has a severe dislike of being told what to do. He firmly hates the system that benefits wealthy people who are immoral, corrupt and greedy, which stems from the emotional trauma of watching his father dying prior to the retirement he had worked hard for all his life. During the show&#x27;s first two series, the writers made notable implications that Lester&#x27;s character had previously had romantic relations with Stacie, and during the fifth and sixth series, created romantic tensions between him and Emma Kennedy. He was initially married to another woman, but divorced her during the first series. Lester departed from the show after the third series, with his character written out as a result, before returning to take part in the fifth series, staying with the show until the end of its final series.
* Albert Stroller (Robert Vaughn – Series 1–8) – the &#x27;roper&#x27;, Stroller is a semi-retired, legendary &#x27;old-school&#x27; grifter, who has a fondness for gambling and cheating at cards, frequents many private clubs, has professional friendships with hotel concierges, and specialises in identifying potential marks and ensnaring them. Vaughn&#x27;s character is mainly portrayed as a mentor and grandfather figure, responsible for training Mickey to be who he is. Despite his experience, he has served time for his crimes, doing so again after the fourth series until the midpoint of the fifth series. Although his backstory puts it that he began his life as a grifter by conning his former employers at a shoe factory and spreading his proceeds among his former co-workers before leaving the States, the third series revealed that he served in the US Army during World War II, while the seventh series revealed that he had a daughter from a previous relationship.
* Ash &quot;Three Socks&quot; Morgan (Robert Glenister – Series 1–8) – the &#x27;fixer&#x27;, Morgan is a resourceful, all-round grifter, capable of finding and setting up locations and securing people, items and websites that are needed to help with convincing a mark that the con is anything but, and gifted at impersonating various people ranging from anything such as elderly pensioners and utility workers to sophisticated upper-class businessmen and politicians. Part of his character includes his love of conducting &#x27;the flop&#x27;, thanks mainly to an old skull fracture he obtained in a bar brawl, passing it off as a fresh injury. During the first series, the writers had him doing the short con with a female partner who suffered brain damage as a direct result; although this was written to have an impact on his character, the plot device was rarely used again in later series. Glenister is the only actor in the show to have appeared in every episode of the show, with the writers later giving his character a lead part in the eighth series on a story that Lester wrote and directed.
* Stacie Monroe (Jaime Murray – Series 1–4, Guest in Series 8) – a charmer, Monroe specialises in using her sex appeal to manipulate potential marks, assisting Morgan in acquiring what is needed, and conducting short cons to help raise funds for the long con they are performing. While extremely intelligent and accomplished, she prefers not to be involved in a romantic connection with another man since her ex-husband left her and took all their life savings with him; this plot device was explored further during the second series. Throughout her appearance between the first and fourth series, the writers created romantic tensions between her and Blue. After she and Warren decided not to return for the fifth series due to scheduling conflicts, her character was written out of the show as a direct result, though the writers later wrote her back in as part of the show&#x27;s finale after Murray agreed to reprise her role.
* Danny Blue (Marc Warren – Series 1–4, Guest in Series 8) – a seasoned short-con artist, Blue is somewhat brash but enthusiastic and imaginative, often wishing to prove he has the talent to pull off long cons and dreaming of being the best grifter in London. As part of his backstory by the writers, Blue&#x27;s family were mostly crooks who were somewhat dishonourable; none of his family are shown, except for his grandmother, whom he deeply loves. During the first three series, he was relegated to the role of second &#x27;inside man&#x27; and being taught what he needed to know about the long con, maintaining a firm rivalry with Mickey with a petty competitive nature between the two, though with each of them respecting the other. After Lester departed from the show, the writers upgraded Warren&#x27;s character to the leader of the team, with the whole series focused on the development of Blue in his new role. Like Murray, Warren decided not to return to the show for the fifth series due to conflicts in his schedule, and thus his character was written out of the show, though he later agreed to reprise his role as his character, alongside Murray, for the show&#x27;s finale.
* Billy Bond (Ashley Walters – Series 4) – a young rookie, whom the writers devised to take on the role of Warren&#x27;s character for the fourth series – astute, with a talent for short cons, though his backstory reveals him to have prior involvement with drug-dealing and street gangs. Despite his past, he is a likeable character among his peers, with a deep respect for Blue and a passion to learn what he needs to about the long con. While Walters decided not to return for the fifth series, the writers wrote off his character without any explanations of what became of him afterwards, though speculation by fans is that he joined with Blue and Monroe in the States; while Walters&#x27; character did not appear for the show&#x27;s finale, it is unclear whether the production staff asked him to reprise this role again.
* Sean Kennedy (Matt Di Angelo – Series 5–8) – a talented young man and one half of a duo along with his sister Emma, Sean originally aspired to be an actor, but later chooses to be an understudy of Mickey and learning to be the &#x27;inside man&#x27;, with additional mentoring by Morgan. He was created as a replacement for Blue, after Warren chose not to return for the fifth series, and his backstory shows him to be eager yet overprotective of his sister while having a firm hatred of his father for abandoning his family when he was young; the emotional impact further increased when he and his sister were put into foster care after their mother died.
* Emma Kennedy (Kelly Adams – Series 5–8) – a talented woman and the brains behind the duo made up of her and her brother Sean, Emma endured to be the stronger of the Kennedy children after they were put into foster care. Like Di Angelo, Adams&#x27; character was created by the writers as a replacement for Murray, after she chose not to return for the fifth series, with her character having the same role as Monroe. In her backstory, alongside having no love for her father, she originally held a previous relationship during her childhood and maintains a firm dislike for men who are sexist, being skilful at drinking games.
* Eddie (Rob Jarvis – Series 1–8) – the owner and proprietor of a local London bar frequented by the team for socialising and planning cons, Eddie is somewhat gullible and at times deluded over his skills and is rather shy when talking to women he likes, yet he maintains respect for Mickey and the others and adopts an attitude of ignorance of what they are doing, sometimes helping out if needed. Despite the team playing tricks and short cons on him, usually to get out of paying drinks or winning money from him, the team hold a deep affection for him and occasionally help him out when he&#x27;s in trouble.

==Production==
===Conception===
&quot;Hustle&quot; was largely born from the same production team that created and popularised the early series of &quot;Spooks&quot;, a similarly styled drama series first broadcast in 2002. Bharat Nalluri, that series&#x27; Executive Director, conceived the idea in early 2002 while filming for the first &quot;Spooks&quot; series was ongoing. Nalluri pitched the concept to Jane Featherstone, managing director of Kudos Film &amp; Television which was the production company behind &quot;Spooks&quot;, in the back of a taxi while returning from a day&#x27;s filming. Intrigued by the idea, Featherstone recruited Tony Jordan, the lead scriptwriter of the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, to develop it into a workable proposal.

Jordan quickly produced some initial script drafts, which Featherstone took to the BBC; Gareth Neame, Head of Drama Commissioning, rapidly approved a six-part series. Featherstone assembled a production team that had considerable overlap with the &quot;Spooks&quot; crew, including Simon Crawford Collins as producer and Matthew Graham as co-writer. In creating the first episodes, Jordan drew inspiration from the long tradition of confidence tricks and heists in Hollywood and television, including &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;The Sting&quot; and &quot;The Grifters&quot; (and in a similar vein, the films and TV series of &quot;&quot;). Featherstone remarked that &quot;&quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; was on around the time Bharat and I first spoke, and I think it helped to inspire us, but really we took our inspiration from a whole catalogue of movies and books... we wanted to make something that had the energy, verve, style and pure entertainment value of those sorts of films&quot; At the same time, the writers attempted to draw on the success of recent blockbusters such as &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; and &quot;&quot;; speaking in an interview in December 2003, Crawford explained that &quot;[such shows] worked because of the interaction within the group – the plotlines were almost irrelevant&quot;.

===Casting===
With &quot;Hustle&quot; greenlit for filming, the production team began searching for actors to play both the main characters and the marks for each episode. The process was initially quite difficult; Crawford described his &quot;immediate thought [as] &#x27;this is so good, how the hell are we going to get a cast to live up to these characters?&#x27;... Tony had created incredibly strong characters, each with their own particular style and panache, but they also had to form a believable, if unusual, &#x27;family&#x27; unit&quot;. Robert Vaughn, the Academy Award-nominated star of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, was soon suggested as a natural choice to play Albert Stroller, the elderly &#x27;roper&#x27; responsible for ensnaring potential marks. After meeting Vaughn over lunch, Crawford &quot;[recognised] straight away that he could bring a whole new dimension to the part of Albert&quot;. Vaughn was immediately offered the role, and asked to begin filming the following day.

Jordan&#x27;s script called for a group of five con artists or &quot;grifters&quot;, with a wide range of ages, appearances and experience. The production team cast Adrian Lester, at the time playing Henry V at the National Theatre, as Michael Stone, the leader of the group; Marc Warren as Danny Blue, Stone&#x27;s younger protégé; and Robert Glenister as Ash Morgan, the &quot;fixer&quot;; in August 2003. Although having numerous credits in film and on the stage, Lester was an unknown face in television, having had less than two hours&#x27; broadcast screen time prior to the first &quot;Hustle&quot; series. Lester explained that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t imagine playing the same character for years, but &quot;Hustle&quot; was completely different. In the very first rehearsal we were doing a dance routine and then the next thing I know I&#x27;m whacking out several different accents and I just thought, &#x27;I&#x27;m in heaven, this is great!&#x27;&quot;

Jaime Murray completed the lead actors, playing Stacie Monroe who, as the grifters&#x27; only female member, is self-styled as &quot;the lure&quot;. Murray, described by one of the &quot;Hustle&quot; production team as &quot;that rare specimen – a stunningly beautiful actress who can actually act&quot;, and who auditioned in platform shoes to match her 5 ft 7in height with Stacie&#x27;s description as having &quot;legs that go on for miles&quot;, was reportedly &quot;terrified&quot; to be working with the more famous actors Vaughn and Lester, saying &quot;when we were filming the first couple of episodes I was absolutely petrified and was convinced that it would be really obvious on screen. So when I watched some of it on tape I was totally amazed that you couldn&#x27;t see how frightened I really was. I kept thinking, &#x27;Oh my God! I&#x27;m working with Adrian Lester and Robert Vaughn. Any time now someone is going to tap me on the shoulder and ask me to get my coat!&#x27;&quot;

In addition to the lead actors, the production team recruited a number of actors, both major and minor, to play the marks in each episode; including David Haig, Tamzin Outhwaite, and David Calder.

===Filming===
With the cast and crew in place, filming for the first &quot;Hustle&quot; series took place in London between August and November 2003. The lead actors were given professional instruction in sleight-of-hand and pick-pocketing; &quot;all the tricks of the trade from card-shuffling to stealing watches&quot;, according to Lester. The cast found the experience informative; Murray explained, &quot;I realised that most cons are all about diversion – while you&#x27;re trying to con somebody you&#x27;re doing something to distract them in the opposite direction so they don&#x27;t notice and that&#x27;s exactly how pickpockets work&quot;.

Several members of the cast described &quot;Hustle&#x27;s&quot; filming schedule as incredibly hectic. Vaughn said that &quot;[the role] was offered to me, and I was told to get on a plane an hour after I got the phone call and start shooting the following day.&quot; Speaking in 2009 after filming four series of the show, Lester explained that &quot;when we start shooting &quot;Hustle&quot; we film two episodes concurrently, with the scenes out of sequence. Knowing where you are in the intricate plots at any one moment is... challenging&quot;. Murray, by contrast, claimed that the hardest scene to film was from the fourth episode, when Danny loses spectacularly to Stacie in strip poker and ends up entirely naked. &quot;It was the toughest scene for me of the entire six months we spent filming the series... Stacie is supposed to be calm, cool and collected... she looks down, checks him out and casually and suavely makes a comment. &quot;I&quot; kept looking down, dissolving into fits of laughter and was almost unable to deliver my line. So all you&#x27;ll see is me laughing&quot;.

Although the programme typically contains few non-trivial stunts or dramatic special effects, the first episode includes an example of Ash Morgan&#x27;s favourite con, known as &quot;The Flop&quot;: having previously received a fractured skull in a bar brawl, Morgan deliberately steps in front of moving cars and exaggerates the accident. Although not actually hurt, X-ray scans show his fractured skull, and the driver&#x27;s insurance company pays out a compensation claim. Glenister balked at doing the entire stunt himself, saying &quot;I got a stunt man who did all the smashing against the windscreen stunts but I did everything else... We all like doing the stunts involving driving fast because it&#x27;s boy&#x27;s-own stuff but when it comes to the dangerous stunts I&#x27;m quite happy to leave it to someone else!&quot;

===Release===
The first episode of the series of &quot;Hustle&quot; was broadcast on BBC One on 24February 2004, driven by a strong advertising campaign organised by Abbott Mead Vickers, surrounding its slogan, &quot;The Con is On&quot;, the same name as that of the initial episode&#x27;s title. The programme was an immediate success, attracting over 6.7 million viewers, and attracting favourable reviews (see below). Before the first series had finished airing, the BBC had sold rebroadcast licences to TV channels in twelve countries, including Italy, Norway, Germany, Israel, Russia and the Netherlands. Anita Davison, Commercial Director for BBC Worldwide, claimed that &quot;the series [had] all the hallmarks of a huge international hit&quot;. The series was later licensed to broadcasters in India and South America.

==Series overview==

In response to the extremely positive reaction, the BBC recommissioned the show for a second series on 17 March 2004, after just three episodes had aired. The second series retained much of the initial production team including Jordan as lead scriptwriter, and introduced Karen Wilson as producer.

===Series two===
Filming for the second &quot;Hustle&quot; series took place in mid-2004, again in and around central London. Lester described the second shoot as &quot;much easier&quot; than the chaotic first series. &quot;On the first series we didn&#x27;t know each other... we were trying to work out what roles we were going to play and the scripts were still being written as we were shooting it; it was all a case of finding out what exactly &quot;Hustle&quot; was going to be.. second time around it was much easier, much quicker... when we were reading the script you could really hear the other actors doing their lines because you knew kind of how they were going to do them...&quot; With the success of the first series, &quot;Hustle&#x27;s&quot; team of writers were able to be more inventive in creating new plots for the second six-episode run, including issues some of the characters had to deal with, and stories which could keep the audience guessing until the end.

The programme retained all of the lead actors from the first series; guest actors appearing in the second run included Lee Ingleby, Fay Ripley, and Robert Llewellyn. The second series was broadcast on BBC One from 29 March 2005, to a first-night audience of 6.7 million.

===Series three===
In the wake of the equally successful second series, the BBC took &quot;Hustle&quot; to the American market, securing a licensing deal with AMC. In addition to exclusive broadcast rights to the first and second series in the United States, AMC also took the position of co-production partner on the third series, already in pre-production, with the option to take the same position on a fourth series. The BBC described the move as &quot;Securing the right platform... essential for a series to succeed in the competitive US market...&quot;. The first two series premiered in the US in January 2006 on AMC The BBC also secured new licensing deals with broadcasters in Australia and New Zealand.

Capitalising on &quot;Hustle&quot;&#x27;s international success, the BBC created a spin off series, &quot;The Real Hustle&quot;, which premiered on 10 February 2006. The documentary follows three genuine hustlers – a magician and professional gambler, a glamorous actress, and a professional sleight-of-hand artist and crooked gambling consultant – as they pull short-cons on unsuspecting businesses and members of the public. The BBC described the series as an attempt &quot;to reveal how the scams work so that the viewer can avoid being ripped off by the same con&quot;.

All five of the lead actors again reprised their roles in the third series, which featured guest stars including Richard Chamberlain, Linford Christie, Sara Cox and Paul Nicholls. The series premiered on 10 March 2006, running until 14 April. The second episode, featuring Danny and Mickey running naked through Trafalgar Square, attracted a viewing audience of 6 million. Lester described the scene as one of his most embarrassing moments on-set, saying &quot;you forget just how many phone cameras there are... we thought [the Square] was fairly deserted, but as soon as someone shouted &#x27;Action&#x27; there was a tour bus behind us and the whole top deck suddenly started filming&quot;.

===Series four===
With the backing of AMC, a fourth series of &quot;Hustle&quot; was virtually guaranteed, and by late 2006 it was clear that the cable network was taking a commanding role in the show&#x27;s development. Despite the increased funding AMC provided, which allowed the writers to set episodes in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, the series was quickly mired in casting concerns. The BBC confirmed Adrian Lester&#x27;s departure in September 2006, elevating Marc Warren&#x27;s character to the lead role and casting Ashley Walters as a new member of the group. The BBC was quick to dispel any suggestion that Lester&#x27;s resignation was connected to the shift in production focus, stating &quot;it is a shame that, due to his current filming commitments, Adrian cannot join us this time round...&quot;, while Lester explained his action as &quot;need[ing] to do something else, be associated with something else&quot;. However, Lester also admitted that he felt that the series &quot;just got a little bit too &#x27;light&#x27;&quot;.

===Series five===
Despite concerns over ratings, the BBC commissioned for a fifth series in early 2008, airing on 28 October 2008, with the return of Adrian Lester, the departure of cast members Marc Warren and Jaime Murray, and the arrival of Matt Di Angelo and Kelly Adams as their replacements. With the return of Lester&#x27;s character, Mickey Bricks, Ashley Walters&#x27;s Billy Bond was removed. Patricia Hodge was written to return in the 5th series, however production issues resulted in her departing the show, subsequently delaying the release of the series.

===Series six===
Series Six started 4 January 2010. All of the fifth series cast returned with production that moved to Birmingham, despite the show retaining its London setting. The series once again consisted of 6 episodes.

===Series seven===
The seventh series of &quot;Hustle&quot; began airing on 7 January 2011. All main cast members from series 6 reprised their roles.

===Series eight===
The eighth series started airing on 13 January 2012 on BBC1 at 9 pm after being pushed back from 6 January. Creator Tony Jordan said that it would be the last series for at least a while; later, the BBC announced that there would not be a series 9. Guest stars featuring this series include Sheila Hancock, Martin Kemp and Paterson Joseph and former Liverpool footballer Ian Rush. Peter Polycarpou and John Barrowman also revealed on Twitter that they had guest roles in series eight. This was the third series to be filmed in Birmingham, the fifth in HD and the fourth series featuring all of the current cast. Adrian Lester directed an episode, in which Mickey is kidnapped.

==Broadcast history==
Following much media speculation, including reports of the programme being cancelled and a motion picture spin-off, the BBC announced on 12 June 2008 that &quot;Hustle&quot; had been recommissioned for a fifth series with series 1–3 star, Adrian Lester returning to the show alongside Robert Glenister and Robert Vaughn. Due to scheduling conflicts, Marc Warren and Jaime Murray did not feature in series five, with Matt Di Angelo and Kelly Adams joining the cast. It was also reported that Patricia Hodge who guest starred as Veronica Powell in the 4th series, would return in the 5th, however due to issues with on-set production, the episode her character was featured in was scrapped and never aired. This subsequently delayed the release of the 5th series, which instead aired in October 2008.

===Film===
In June 2006, 20th Century Fox acquired the film rights to &quot;Hustle&quot;; and creator, Tony Jordan, wrote several drafts. In February 2009, executive producer, Simon Crawford Collins stated that the movie was to be produced by a major United States studio. But the film was never made.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The first series of &quot;Hustle&quot;, broadcast from 24 February to 30 March 2004, attracted generally favourable reviews and audience figures. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;defiantly high-concept, tightly plotted, knowing stuff... a laugh; slick, glossy, and smart certainly, but a laugh all the same&quot;, and &quot;The Times&quot; remarked that it had &quot;the snap and style of a series that has been cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and brought back to life, like &quot;The Clangers&quot;... The wonderfully absurd result is a drama series that takes itself far less seriously than almost anything since &quot;The Persuaders&quot;&quot;. A later review from the same paper summarised the series as &quot;an engaging, well-acted, snappily directed drama... sleekly edited, flatteringly lit, and stylishly executed... Will you remember a single moment of it five minutes after you&#x27;ve watched an episode? Probably not. But who cares?&quot; The first three episodes attracted an average audience of 6.2 million, peaking at over 30% of the total audience.

===Awards and nominations===
The title sequence, created by Berger &amp; Wyse, was nominated for a Royal Television Society Award (2005), a BAFTA (2006) and an Emmy (2007).

<doc id="565172" wikidata="Q313128" url="?curid=565172" title="Prince Paul of Yugoslavia">
<text>Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, also known as Paul Karađorđević (, English transliteration: &quot;Paul Karageorgevich&quot;; 27 April 1893 – 14 September 1976), was prince regent of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during the minority of King Peter II. Paul was a first cousin of Peter&#x27;s father, Alexander I.

== Early life ==
Prince Paul of Yugoslavia was the only son of Prince Arsen of Serbia, younger brother of King Peter I, and of Princess and Countess Aurora Pavlovna Demidova, a granddaughter on one side of the Swedish speaking Finnish philanthropist Aurora Karamzin and her Russian husband Prince and Count Pavel Nikolaievich Demidov and on the other of the Russian Prince Peter Troubetzkoy and his wife, Elisabeth Esperovna, by birth a Princess Belosselsky-Belozersky. The House of Karađorđević was in exile with Serbia being ruled by their archenemies, the House of Obrenović. Paul grew up in Geneva and was raised as a lonely and abandoned child in the household of his uncle, Peter Karađorđević. The long and bloody vendetta between the Houses of Obrenović and Karađorđević that started in 1817 ended in 1903 when a military coup d&#x27;état saw the last Obrenović king, Alexander overthrown and hacked to death in his bedchamber. Petar Karađorđević returned to Serbia to become King Peter I. Paul followed his uncle and arrived in Serbia for the first time in 1903. In 1912, he made the decision to attend the University of Oxford, which was most unusual as the Serbian elite preferred to be educated in either Paris or St. Petersburg.

Paul was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a member of the exclusive Bullingdon Club – a dining club notorious for its wealthy members, grand banquets and boisterous rituals. Cultivated like his closest friends Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Sir Henry Channon, his outlook on life was said to be British. Paul often said that he &quot;felt like an Englishman&quot;. Channon called Paul &quot;the person I have loved most&quot;. For a time, Paul and Channon lived together in a house in London together with another of Channon&#x27;s lovers Lord Gage. A cultured and easy-going bon vivant who inspired much affection from his friends, Paul when not associating with the British aristocracy collected paintings by Monet, Titian and van Gogh.

Despite the fact that it was Austria-Hungary that declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914, Paul only joined the Royal Serbian Army in November 1914, serving for six months before returning to Britain in May 1915. Paul returned to service with the Royal Serbian Army, which was now in exile in Greece in January-April 1917 before again returning to Britain. His military record during both of his tours of duty was described as &quot;undistinguished&quot; as Paul found he was not cut out to be a soldier. Paul argued that he could be at most service to Serbia by being in London, where he served as a lobbyist for Serbia.

Paul lived in London from 1919 to 1924 and only infrequently visited Belgrade. During his time in London, he was the proverbial &quot;life of the party&quot; who enjoyed socialising with the British elite at parties in London or in various country houses. On October 22, 1923, he married Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark, a sister of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. The Duke of York (the future King George VI), was the best man at his wedding in Belgrade. In January 1924, he returned to Yugoslavia. Paul&#x27;s cousin, King Alexander, seemed to have had in mind installing him in some sort of vice-regal position in Zagreb to govern the Croats; Alexander enjoyed Paul&#x27;s company, finding him to be a witty conversationalist with a &quot;breadth of vision&quot; and a &quot;cool intellect&quot;. However, the king decided that Paul was too sympathetic towards Croat complaints about the unitary state created by the 1921 Vidovdan Constitution, and decided not to give him the vice-regal position, much to Paul&#x27;s frustration.

Through careful never to openly criticise the constitution, Paul sympathised with the Croat demand to turn Yugoslavia into a federation, and felt that many Serb politicians were being unrealistic in expecting that Croat discontent would just dissolve of its own accord if given enough time. Paul found his palace at Dedinje to be gloomy, causing him to relocate to a villa in Slovenia, where he felt more at home, and where he took up his time with his ever expanding art collection and raising his family. Besides collecting art, Paul&#x27;s interests were reading, fishing and hunting. Whenever there was a major art show in London, Paris, Munich, Florence, Rome and Vienna, Paul almost invariably was present both to admire the art and purchase paintings for his collection.

== Appointment as Regent of Yugoslavia ==
On 9 October 1934 Vlado Chernozemski assassinated Paul&#x27;s first-cousin, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, in Marseille, France, and Prince Paul became the regent, as Alexander had stipulated in his will that on his death a regency council chaired by Paul should govern until Alexander&#x27;s son Peter II came of age. Late on the afternoon of 9 October, Paul received a telephone call with the news that king had been assassinated, and that he was to go to the royal palace at once. Alexander had survived two previous assassination attempts, and had hinted that if he should die, that Paul was to serve as regent. Upon arriving at the royal palace, Paul was met by the prime minister, Nikola Uzunović, and the commander of the Royal Guard, General Petar Živković. The three men opened up the safe that contained the royal will whose terms stated that Paul was to serve as the regent until the new king Peter II came of age in September 1941.

Prince Paul, far more than Alexander, was Yugoslav rather than Serb in outlook, and unlike Alexander, he was inclined much more toward democracy. In its broadest outline, his domestic policy worked to eliminate the heritage of the Alexandrine dictatorship&#x27;s centralism, censorship, and military control, and to pacify the country by solving the Serb-Croat problem. Paul wanted to achieve a Serb-Croat reconciliation, but also felt for a considerable period of time that he had the duty to hand over the kingdom to Peter more or less unchanged when he reached his maturity, and thus was unwilling to entertain constitutional changes. Trifković wrote that: &quot;By both instinct and personal development, Pavle was averse both to autocratic rule and militarism.&quot;

As Prince Regent, Paul possessed very broad powers, but he was much less inclined to exercise these powers, leading Yugoslavia in the years 1934–41 to be labelled &quot;a dictatorship without a dictator&quot;. Paul had been thrust into a position of power that he did not want by Alexander&#x27;s assassination (which was why Alexander had chosen him in his will to serve as a regent, knowing he would never try to seize the throne from his son), and throughout his regency he gave the impression that ruling Yugoslavia was a burden to him.

A French diplomat described Paul as a man whose &quot;incontestable qualities of character, balance, and taste... Oxonian dilettantism and charm, which he exercised on his visitors, were useless in the present circumstances and in a country where arguments of might are the only ones which count&quot;. British historian D. C. Watt noted that Paul&#x27;s &quot;nerves tended to betray him under stress and that he was by nature inclined to yield to pressure rather than withstand it&quot;. Married to a Greek princess and intensely Anglophile and Hellenophile, Paul distrusted Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.

The heavy losses taken by Serbia in World War I made Paul very averse to engaging in another war and led him to favoring neutralist policies despite Yugoslavia&#x27;s alliance with France. During the First World War, Serbia had proportionally taken the heaviest losses; one out of five Serbs who were alive in 1914 were dead by 1918. The French police investigation of King Alexander&#x27;s assassination had established firm evidence that the assassins had been armed by the governments of Italy and Hungary, which was shared with Yugoslavia. Furthermore, the forged Czechoslovak passports that had allowed the assassins to travel to France had come from Hungary, and the assassins had telephoned Ante Pavelić, who was living in Rome at the time. However, the French premier Pierre Laval-who was seeking an alliance with Italy-made it very clear to Paul that France would not support Yugoslavia if it chose to make an issue of Italian involvement in the assassination of the king, saying that the most Yugoslavia could do was to blame Hungary. The way that the French were prepared to disregard Yugoslav concerns about the regicide for the sake of better relations with Italy soured Paul on the French alliance.

== Stojadinović years ==
On 24 June 1935, Paul appointed Milan Stojadinović as prime minister, with a mandate to deal with the Great Depression and find a solution to the &quot;Croat question&quot;. Stojadinović believed that the solution to the Great Depression were closer economic ties with Germany, which had more people than what it could feed and lacked many of the raw materials necessary for a modern industrial economy. As Germany needed both food and raw materials such as iron, bauxite, copper and manganese, Yugoslav exports of both agricultural products and of minerals to the &quot;Reich&quot; bloomed from 1935 onward, leading to an economic revival and to placing Yugoslavia in the German economic sphere of influence.

Yugoslavia had signed a treaty of alliance with France in 1927, while the Rhineland was still occupied by France, and during Franco-Yugoslav staff talks, it was promised that France would take the offensive into western Germany if Germany should start another war. As long as the Rhineland remained a demilitarized zone, there was always the possibility of the French launching an offensive into western Germany, which reassured Yugoslavia. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that the demilitarized status of the Rhineland the Treaty of Versailles had imposed was &quot;the single most important guarantee of peace in Europe&quot; for as long as the Rhineland was demilitarized, it was impossible for Germany to attack any of France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe without exposing itself to the risk of a devastating French offensive into western Germany.

The remilitarization of the Rhineland on 7 March 1936 meant that Germany started building the West Wall along its border with France, which ended any hope of a French offensive into western Germany. On 15–20 June 1936, the chiefs of staff of the Little Entente (Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia) met in Bucharest to discuss their plans now that the Rhineland was re-militarized. The gloomy conclusion of the Bucharest meeting was that France was not a factor in Eastern Europe, and henceforward there were only two great powers in Eastern Europe, namely the Soviet Union and Germany, and the victory of either in another war would mean the end of their independence.

Despite his pro-British and pro-French feelings, Paul believed in the aftermath of the remilitarization of the Rhineland that Yugoslavia needed to tilt its foreign policy towards Germany. Likewise, the Hoare–Laval Pact of 1935 and British attempts to improve Anglo-Italian relations such as the &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement&quot; of 1937 and the Easter Accords of 1938 caused Paul to believe the British were willing to sacrifice Yugoslavia for the sake of better relations with Italy. Stojadinović, who openly admired Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, made a major diplomatic push with the tacit support of the Prince Regent for better relations with the fascist states in the winter of 1936–37.

Without informing France, Czechoslovakia or Romania, Stojadinović signed an agreement with Italy on 25 March 1937 that badly weakened the Little Entente. Just before Stojadinović had signed the treaty, Paul let the British minister in Belgrade, Ronald Campbell, know of what was being planned. Paul seems to have believed that if Yugoslavia was seen as falling within the Italian sphere of influence, that might prompt a British response to pull Yugoslavia in the other direction. The agreements with Italy very much alarmed the French who sent out General Maurice Gamelin to visit Belgrade in September 1937, followed by the Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos in December 1937, who in both cases sought reassurances that Yugoslavia was not abandoning its alliance with France. Stojadinović&#x27;s foreign policies were unpopular, at least with the Serbs. When President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia visited Belgrade, he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds cheering him, which was seen as a sign that public opinion was still attached to the traditional alliances. Stojadinović, supported by Paul, believed that an Anglo-German rapprochement was the best way to save the peace, accepting that an international order established by the Treaty of Versailles was doomed, and that the best way of saving the peace would be to make concessions to the &quot;Reich&quot; without letting Germany dominate Europe too much. At a Little Entente summit at King Carol II&#x27;s summer residence at Sinaia in August 1937, Paul and Stojadinović pressed Beneš to end Czechoslovakia&#x27;s alliance with the Soviet Union, complaining it upset the Germans too much. At the same time, Yugoslav diplomats tried to effect a German-Czechoslovak rapprochement, telling the Germans that Beneš had only signed the alliance with the Soviet Union out of fear, and suggested that if the Germans stopped making threats against Czechoslovakia, then perhaps Beneš could be persuaded to abrogate the alliance. Through Paul had supported Stojadinović up to this point, in about late 1937 he started to express concern about the prime minister who spoke of having Yugoslavia join the Axis powers as he felt that Stojadinović was alienating Yugoslavia&#x27;s traditional allies too much.

During the Sudetenland crisis, Stojadinović leaned in a pro-Axis position while Campbell reported that much of the Yugoslav officer corps sympathized with Yugoslavia&#x27;s ally Czechoslovakia, and implied that a coup d&#x27;état was possible if Stojadinović declared neutrality. Terence Shone, the first secretary at the British legation in Belgrade reported that Serbian public opinion was very pro-Czechoslovak and expected Yugoslavia to go to war if its ally were attacked. Paul was described as being relieved by the Munich Agreement, which ended the possibility of a war that would have placed his country in a dilemma.
In January 1939, Stojadinović had told the Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano of his wish to turn his Yugoslav Radical Union into the only legal party, saying he wanted to establish a fascist dictatorship that carries out a pro-Italian foreign policy &quot;to find a balanced situation and security within the framework of the Axis&quot;. Stojadinović and Ciano discussed the possibility of dividing up Albania, a plan immediately vetoed by Paul who complained that in his opinion Yugoslavia already had too many Albanians (whose loyalty to Yugoslavia was questionable) and adding more would be unhelpful. At the same time, the Croat deputies in the &quot;skupshtina&quot; (parliament) called on foreign powers to intervene to give the Croats &quot;liberty of choice and destiny&quot;, accusing Stojadinović of being a tyrant.

== Danzig crisis: countdown to war ==
On 4 February 1939, Paul dismissed Stojadinović as prime minister and at that point the Yugoslav tilt towards the Axis was stopped. After dismissing Stojadinović, Paul rejected an Italian appeal to support the Italian annexation of Albania. On 15 March 1939, Germany occupied the Czech half of the rump state of Czecho-Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia had been renamed in October 1938), turning it into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The fact that the &quot;Reich&quot; extinguished the independence of Czecho-Slovakia despite the way in which Emil Hácha and the rest of the leaders had endeavoured to carry out a slavishly pro-German foreign policy, came as a considerable shock to Paul.

Later, when the Italians annexed Albania on Easter weekend 1939, Paul declined to make a protest, which severely strained relations with Yugoslavia&#x27;s Balkan Pact ally Turkey, which protested most vehemently against the annexation of a Muslim-majority nation with which the Turks had historically close ties. The Italian annexation of Albania led to Italy controlling both sides of the Strait of Otranto, and thus allowed the Italians to cut Yugoslavia off from access to the rest of the world. On 12 May 1939, Britain and Turkey issued a joint declaration promising &quot;to ensure the establishment of security in the Balkans&quot;. As Paul was about to make a state visit to Italy, he found the statement from the Turkish ambassador in Belgrade suggesting that Yugoslavia work with Turkey in the spirit of the Anglo-Turkish declaration to resist any further Italian advances in the Balkans very poorly timed and made it clear that he wanted nothing to do with the Turkish proposal.
Paul backed a plan floated by Turkish Foreign Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu for Bulgaria to join the Balkan Pact and, in a letter, urged King Carol II of Romania to cede part of the Dobruja region as the price of Bulgaria joining the Balkan Pact. In his letter, Paul stressed the importance of stopping Italy from invading more Balkan nations, which required getting the Bulgarians out of the Italian sphere of influence (King Boris III of Bulgaria was married to the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy). He wrote that he wanted the Bulgarians &quot;off my back&quot; to allow the Yugoslavs and Greeks to focus on countering the Italians, who were now building up their forces in their new colony of Albania. Unlike the Hungarians, whom Paul felt would never abandon their claims against Yugoslavia, the Bulgarians were felt to be more tractable.

After Germany and Italy, Hungary was the nation that Paul worried about the most as he noted that Danube river valley ran down from the Hungarian plain straight to Belgrade. At the same time, Yugoslavia began staff talks with Greece with the aim of resisting an Italian invasion of either nation. A major problem for Yugoslavia was the lack of modern weapons together with the money to pay for them. Watt wrote that &quot;Paul&#x27;s tactics were aimed at winning credits and securing arms deliveries wherever he could, in Berlin, Paris or London&quot;. After talking to Raymond Brugère, the French minister in Belgrade, the latter promised the prince regent that he would fly to Paris personally to lobby for Yugoslavia.

On 29 June 1939, it was that announced that the Bank Seligmann of Paris was going to make a loan of 600 million francs to Yugoslavia that was to be spent on weapons for the Yugoslav military. The Germans had broken the Yugoslav diplomatic codes and were well aware of Paul&#x27;s attempts to play off the Axis powers against the Allied powers to secure the best deal for Yugoslavia; Paul&#x27;s salvation in 1939 rested with the fact that Germany was about to invade Poland and needed raw materials from Yugoslavia like bauxite and copper to keep the German armaments industry going. After Hitler had the decision to launch &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; (Case White), the invasion of Poland, the &quot;Reich&quot; wanted two things from Yugoslavia, namely an agreement to supply Germany with all the necessary raw materials and that Yugoslavia not only refuse to join the British-inspired &quot;peace front&quot; but also formally aligned its diplomacy with the Axis powers.

In 1939, Prince Paul, as acting head of state, accepted an official invitation from Adolf Hitler and spent nine days in Berlin. During his visit to Berlin, a massive effort was made to persuade Paul to not join the &quot;peace front&quot; that was meant to &quot;contain&quot; Germany. Paul was greeted by Hitler at the train station in Berlin, was made the guest of honor at a reception and dinner at the Reich Chancellery, visited the Potsdam military base, saw a gala performance of Wagner at the Berlin opera, and reviewed two major military parades meant to impress upon him the power of the &quot;Reich&quot;. For the first part of his trip, Paul stayed at Bellevue Palace, an old imperial palace and then for the last three days, at Göring&#x27;s estate at Carinhall. Despite all the pomp, Paul during his visit to Germany repeatedly refused the demands made by his hosts to sign an economic agreement that would have turned Yugoslavia into a German economic colony or some overt pro-Axis gesture like pulling Yugoslavia out of the League of Nations and signing the Anti-Comintern Pact. The German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop called Paul a &quot;log&quot; (a German slang term meaning somebody who is very stupid) while Hitler was very angry that despite all the lavish hospitality the only concession Paul made was to slightly readjust the exchange rate between the &quot;Reichsmark&quot; and the Dinar. In return for readjusting the exchange rate, Paul forced the Germans to finally deliver some of the aircraft that Yugoslavia had paid for in advance in 1938, but the Germans kept finding excuses not to deliver.

While he was in Germany, Paul dispatched General Petar Pešić on a secret mission to Paris and London to find out what were the Anglo-French plans in the event of a war. Pešić told Lord Gort of the British General Staff and French General Maurice Gamelin that Yugoslavia would declare neutrality if Germany invaded Poland but would be willing to enter the war for the Allies the moment that the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea came under Allied operational control. Pešić argued that from the Allied viewpoint that Yugoslav neutrality could be advantageous in the sense that Yugoslavia at present could not stop the German Wehrmacht from occupying the country if Hitler so desired, which would allow the Germans to exploit all of the crucial raw materials of Yugoslavia, but if Yugoslavia remained neutral and entered the war when the Allies could support it, then raw materials would be permanently denied to the Germans.

Pešić found that the French, who preferred that fighting take place anywhere but France, were far more interested in having Yugoslavia enter the conflict if the Danzig Crisis led to a war than were the British. From Gamelin, he learned the French were already planning on having the Army of the Levant commanded by Maxime Weygand land at Thessaloniki to march up the Balkans to link up with the Yugoslavs and the Romanians to aid the Poles. In May 1939, Yugoslavia changed its diplomatic codes, which stopped both the Italians and Germans from reading the Yugoslav codes. The same month, when Romanian Foreign Minister Grigore Gafencu visited Belgrade, Paul spoke to him of his wish for both Yugoslavia and Romania to have closer ties with Britain.

Despite repeated pressure from both the German and Italian ministers in Belgrade, Paul refused their demand for Yugoslavia to leave the League of Nations as a symbolic move to show that Yugoslavia was now associated with the Axis states. As Germany and Japan had both left the League of Nations in 1933 while Italy had left the League in 1937, the Axis powers always attached immense symbolic importance to having other nations leaving the League as showing diplomatic alignment with them.
In June 1939, Paul warned the American ambassador to Yugoslavia that the &quot;Forschungsamt&quot; (research office – German cryptanalytic intelligence agency) was reading all of the diplomatic cables going into and out of Belgrade, including the American ones, and the ambassador should be careful what information he cabled back to Washington, DC. On 15 July 1939, Paul left Belgrade to visit London with a stop over in Paris to see Pešić.
From Pešić, Paul learned that he had the impression that on one hand, the French were keen to start a second front in the Balkans in the event of war while on the other hand that the French Navy would play only a defensive role, guarding convoys from Algeria to France. In London, Paul advocated that Britain launch a &quot;preemptive war&quot; against Italy, saying that if Italy were knocked out, then Yugoslavia would definitely move closer to Britain. Paul ordered that the National Bank of Yugoslavia&#x27;s gold reserves be transferred to London as a sign of his faith in Britain.

He told his British hosts that Yugoslavia was not ready to join the &quot;peace front&quot; yet but was moving in that direction. Paul also told Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax that Paul would use his influence with the more hesitant Balkan Pact nations, Romania and Greece, to try to bring them into the &quot;peace front&quot;. During the same visit, he was installed as a Stranger Knight Companion of the Garter, the most important British order of chivalry, by King George VI, which greatly offended Hitler, who complained that Paul&#x27;s heart was with the British. During his talks with Lord Halifax in London, Paul received elusive replies to his demands for a British &quot;preemptive war&quot; against Italy as Paul contended that as long as the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; existed, there was always the possibility of Yugoslavia being cut off from Britain and France. Both Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax regarded Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini as the more moderate and reasonable of the fascist leaders and that, despite signing the Pact of Steel in May, he might still be &quot;peeled off&quot; from his alliance with Germany. Paul&#x27;s fears of the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; were confirmed in June 1940 when Italy entered the war and caused the British to start supplying Egypt via the long way around Africa on the Cape of Good Hope route as the danger of Italian air and naval attacks made crossing the central Mediterranean too dangerous, the only exception being supply convoys for Malta.

Fearful of being cut off, Paul advocated to Halifax that if Britain ended up declaring war on Germany as a result of the latter invading Poland, then Britain should immediately launch air and naval attacks to destroy the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; and the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; regardless if Italy was neutral or not. It was Paul&#x27;s belief that even if Mussolini declared neutrality at first, he would inevitably that he would come into the war on Germany&#x27;s side at some point. Paul very much wanted an Anglo-French landing at the Greek city of Thessaloniki in the event of war, as he believed that to be the only way that Yugoslavia could resist a German invasion. Paul also expressed his hope that the British would include the Soviet Union the proposed &quot;peace front&quot; as the best way of deterring Germany from invading Poland. While Paul was visiting London, Yugoslav Finance Minister Vojin Đuričić was in Paris and signed there on 14 July an agreement with Prime Minister Édouard Daladier for France to sell Yugoslavia anti-aircraft guns, trucks, howitzers, anti-tank guns, machine guns, tanks and tank transporters.

As the Danzig Crisis pushed Europe to the brink of war, Vladko Maček of the Croatian Peasant Party became convinced of the necessity of &quot;throwing a bridge across the abyss which separated Serb from Croat&quot;. Paul supported Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković&#x27;s efforts to reach an understanding with Maček, despite his wish to hand over Yugoslavia unchanged to King Peter when he reached his majority, since Paul felt that an end to the Serb-Croat dispute was the best way to allow Yugoslavia to survive the coming storm. On 20 August 1939, the Cvetković-Maček Agreement set up the Banovina of Croatia to be ruled by a &quot;ban&quot; (governor) responsible to the king and a &quot;sabor&quot; (parliament) in Zagreb. The central government retained control of the monarchy, foreign affairs, national defence, foreign trade, commerce, transport, public security, religion, mining, weights and measures, insurance and education policy, but Croatia was to have its own legislature in Zagreb with a separate budget. The &quot;sporazum&quot; (agreement) granted broad autonomy to Croatia, and partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina as the government agreed to Maček&#x27;s demand for all of the Croats in Yugoslavia to live under the authority of the Croatian &quot;banovina&quot;. The &quot;sporazum&quot; was popular with moderate Croat opinion, but it was extremely unpopular with the Bosnian Muslims, who objected to the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Likewise, Serbs was outraged by that the &quot;sporazum&quot; had &quot;abandoned&quot; the &quot;prečani&quot; Serbs in Bosnia and the &quot;Krajina&quot; region to Croat rule. The charge that Paul and Cvetković had &quot;sold out&quot; to the Croats with the &quot;sporazum&quot; made them unpopular with the Serbs, and if it did not cause the Yugoslav coup d&#x27;état of 26 March 1941, it certainly was an essential prerequisite for the coup. Finally, the Slovenes demanded for a similar degree of autonomy to be granted to them.

On 26 August 1939, as the Danzig Crisis moved towards its climax, Paul, in a letter to Lord Halifax, once again urged that Britain launch a &quot;preemptive war&quot; against Italy if Germany invaded Poland. Paul warned if Germany conquered Poland, Italy would sooner or later enter the war, and if that happened, the Italian forces in Albania with support from Bulgaria would be used to threaten the other Balkan states. Paul concluded in that case &quot;a rot throughout the Balkans&quot; would follow as the other Balkan states together with Turkey would turn towards Germany to protect them from Italy. Sir Ronald Campbell, the British minister in Belgrade, in a cable to Lord Halifax wrote that Paul was &quot;in the last stages of despair&quot;. Halifax wrote on the margin on Paul&#x27;s letter that he was suffering from manic-depression again. Brugère, who very much liked Paul, proved more sympathetic and, in a dispatch to Paris, urged for France to land a force at Thessaloniki if Germany invaded Poland. The French proved supportive of the idea of landing at Thessaloniki, but Allied strategy was determined by an Inter-Allied War Council, and the British were stoutly opposed to the French plans for a &quot;second front&quot; in the Balkans. The news of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact was an especially bitter blow for Paul, as it ensured that the two strongest powers in Eastern Europe would be working together, and it ended the regent&#x27;s hopes of an Anglo-French alliance, which might finally rid Yugoslavia of the constant Italian efforts to undermine national unity.

== Second World War ==
When the Second World War broke out in September 1939 by the German invasion of Poland, Yugoslavia declared its neutrality. During the Phoney War, Paul arranged for Yugoslavia to step up deliveries of copper to Germany in exchanges for promises that Germany would finally deliver arms that Yugoslavia had paid for in advance but for which Germany kept finding excuses not to deliver. Germany also wanted Yugoslavia to refuse to join the British-inspired &quot;peace front&quot; and even for it to align its diplomacy formally with the Axis powers. In his sympathies, Paul preferred for France and Britain to win the war, but he was markedly afraid of the Wehrmacht. Paul repeatedly pressed for a revival of the Salonika Front strategy of First World War by arguing that if French and British forces landed at Thessaloniki, which would place them in a position to aid Yugoslavia, he might lean more towards the Allies. During the Phoney War, a popular if erroneous rumour in Croatia that Paul was planning to enter the war on the Allied side and send Croat regiments to man the Maginot Line in France increased support for Croat separatism.

Such was Paul&#x27;s desperation for a counterbalance to Germany that he even turned towards the Soviet Union. Vasily Strandtman, the Russian chargé d&#x27;affaires at the legation in Belgrade in 1914, finally closed the legation in October 1939 under strong pressure from the Yugoslav government. In May 1940, an economic agreement was signed with the Soviet Union, and in June 1940, Yugoslavia finally established diplomatic relations with Moscow, being one of the last European states to recognize the Soviet Union. In December 1940 and again in March 1941, Paul attempted to have Yugoslavia buy modern military equipment from the Soviet Union.

On 4 March 1941, Paul met with Adolf Hitler at the Berghof high up in the Bavarian Alps. Hitler told Paul that he already decided to invade Greece and in exchange for the Wehrmacht being granted transit rights through Yugoslavia was willing to assign Thessaloniki to Yugoslavia after the expected conquest of Greece. Paul refused the offer and said that as his wife was Greek, he could not permit Yugoslavia to be used as a base for aggression against Greece. Paul also admitted that his sympathies were with Britain and stated to sign the Tripartite Pact would lead to his overthrow. General Franz Halder, the chief of the Germany Army Staff who attended the meeting, wrote in his diary: &quot;No positive results. No intention to join the Tripartite Pact&quot;. On 6 March 1941, Paul called a meeting of the Yugoslav Crown Council at which Pešić stated his opinion as a soldier that the Royal Yugoslav Army could not stop a German invasion, and the best that could be hoped for was to hold out for six weeks in the mountains of Bosnia. The next day, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Marković approached Victor von Heeren, the German minister in Belgrade, and said that Yugoslavia was willing to sign the Tripartite Pact if no transit rights allowing the Wehrmacht to invade Greece from Yugoslavia were granted and said that Paul could not in good conscience allow Yugoslavia to be used as a base for war against his wife&#x27;s homeland.

On 25 March 1941, the Yugoslav government signed the Axis Tripartite Pact with significant reservations, as three notes were appended. The first note obliged the Axis powers to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Yugoslavia. In the second note, the Axis powers promised not to ask Yugoslavia for any military assistance, and in the third note, they promised not to ask permission to move military forces across Yugoslav territory during the war. Nonetheless, the signing of the pact did not sit well with several elements of the Royal Yugoslav Army. On 27 March 1941, two days after Yugoslavia had signed the Tripartite Pact, Yugoslav military figures with British support forcibly removed Paul from power and declared King Peter II of age. German and Italian forces invaded the country ten days later.

== Exile ==

For the remainder of the war, Prince Paul was kept, with his family, under house arrest by the British in Kenya. Paul and his family arrived at Oserian, the former home of Lord Erroll on the shores of Lake Naivasha on 28 April 1941. Oserian was in a state of disrepair as the earl had been murdered earlier in 1941 and Princess Olga called it &quot;a complete nightmare&quot;. Paul and his family were under house arrest, being forbidden to leave the grounds of the Oserian. British newspapers depicted Paul as a Nazi sympathizer, despite his Anglophile tendencies.

His sister-in-law, the Duchess of Kent, and her husband, the Duke of Kent, appealed to Winston Churchill in the hope of allowing Paul and his wife, Princess Olga, to take refuge in Britain. However, Churchill rejected the request in no uncertain manner since he viewed Paul as a traitor and war criminal. After the Duke of Kent&#x27;s death in 1942, Churchill relented to King George&#x27;s insistence and allowed Olga to fly to London to comfort her sister but without her husband, who had been extremely close to the late Duke. One of Paul&#x27;s old friends, the South African Prime Minister, Jan Smuts, lobbied Churchill to release Paul, who was finally freed in 1944 and was allowed to settle in Johannesburg. Smuts granted Paul and his family asylum. Smuts lost the 1948 South African general election to D. F. Malan of the National Party, which was less sympathetic towards Paul being in South Africa.

Paul lived in South Africa until 1949, when he moved to Paris. Paul always spent his summers at his villa in Tuscany, the Villa Demidoff, where his neighbor was his old friend, the wealthy American art historian and art dealer, Bernard Berenson. Berenson had long maintained his home at his Tuscan villa, &quot;I Tatti&quot;. As Berenson was one of the richest and most influential figures in the art world, Paul was able to continue adding to his art collection. The British art historian John Pope-Hennessy, who once had lunch with Berenson and Paul, wrote: &quot;I found Princess Olga’s guttural manner rather disconcerting, but Prince Paul I liked from the beginning&quot;.

The postwar Communist authorities in Yugoslavia had Prince Paul proclaimed an enemy of the state, barred him from ever returning to Yugoslavia and confiscated all of his property in Yugoslavia.

Prince Paul was the father of Princess Elizabeth, Prince Alexander, and Prince Nikola, and was the grandfather of the American author Christina Oxenberg and American actress Catherine Oxenberg.

==Burial==

Prince Paul died in Paris on 14 September 1976, aged 83 and was buried at the Bois-de-Vaux Cemetery in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Prince Paul was rehabilitated by the Serbian courts in 2011 and on 6 October 2012 was reburied at the family crypt of Oplenac, near Topola in central Serbia, together with his wife Olga and son Nikola.

==Further research==
Princess Elizabeth, his only daughter, obtained information from the British Special Operations Executive files in the Foreign Office in London and published them in Belgrade in the 1990 edition of the Serbian-language biography of her father. The original book, &quot;Paul of Yugoslavia: Britain&#x27;s Maligned Friend&quot;, was written by Neil Balfour, the first being published by Eaglet Publishing in London in 1980.

In 1967, the diaries of the Conservative MP Henry &quot;Chips&quot; Channon were published but were heavily censored, as homosexuality was still illegal in Britain, and many of the people named in the diaries were still alive, which exposed the publishers to the risk of libel suits. In February 2021, the first part of the uncensored version of Channon&#x27;s diaries was published, which caused a stir as Channon wrote of having homosexual relations with numerous well-known men (among them the playwright Terence Rattigan), and it was strongly implied that Paul had been Channon&#x27;s lover.

The Serbian historian Srdja Trifković wrote that Paul was a tragic figure: &quot;Prince Pavle of Yugoslavia is a figure both unique and uniquely tragic in modern Serbian history. His was the story of a perennial outsider; a sophisticated art-lover thrust into the murky world of Balkan politics; an incorrigible Anglophile forced into unsavory deals with England&#x27;s enemies; a gentleman in a world of perfidious rogues. Always at pains to square the demands of personal integrity with those of the &#x27;art of the possible&#x27;, he was ultimately unloved in Belgrade, mistrusted in Berlin and scorned in London.&quot;

== Art collections ==
Prince Paul, together with King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, collected, donated and dedicated a large number of art works to Serbia and the Serbian people, including foreign masterpieces. There are especially significant Italian, French and Dutch/Flemish pieces. Most of the works are in the National Museum of Serbia, including work by artists such as Rubens, Renoir, Monet, Titian, Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin.

<text>Magnús Ver Magnússon (born 23 April 1963) is an Icelandic former powerlifter and strongman competitor. He is a four-time World&#x27;s Strongest Man, having won in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996 and is widely regarded as one of the greatest strongmen of all time.

==Career==
===Powerlifting===
Magnús began powerlifting in 1984. In 1985, he won a medal in the junior European and World Championships. He won the Senior European title in the 125 kg (276 lb) class in 1988 and 1990. His best lifts in competition include a 400 kg (882 lb) squat, 275 kg (606 lb) bench press, 370.5 kg (817 lb) deadlift, and a total of 1015.5 kg (2239 lb) all with single ply equipment.

===Strongman===
Magnús competed in his first strongman contest in 1985, finishing third in the Iceland&#x27;s Strongest Man competition won by Jón Páll Sigmarsson. He decided to focus solely on strongman competition after he won the 1991 World&#x27;s Strongest Man contest. His strongman victories include the 1989 Pure Strength team contest in Scotland with Hjalti Árnason, the 1991 and 1993 International Power Challenge, the 1992 Scandinavian Strongest Man (Finland), the 1992 Nordic Strongest Man (Denmark), the 1994 Europe&#x27;s Strongest Man, the 1995 World Muscle Power Championship, and the 1995 and 1997 Viking Challenge.

In addition to his four World&#x27;s Strongest Man titles, Magnús was also runner-up in 1992 and 1993. He has also won the Iceland&#x27;s strongest man competition seven times and the West coast Viking (Vestfjarðavíkingurinn) of Iceland nine times. He carried Jón Páll&#x27;s formula of being athletic for the dynamic tests of strength and having tremendous static strength to outlift some of the best Powerlifters. He was able to easily out-deadlift the favoured O.D. Wilson by 40 kg in 1991 and out-squatted the world record holder in the squat, Gerrit Badenhorst, in 1995. After Magnus squatted 437.5 kg in a smith machine setup, Badenhorst commented that he had previously underestimated Magnus&#x27; pure strength and that Magnus&#x27; squat was the greatest squat he had ever seen from someone of his bodyweight.

He competed in a one-off event at the Giants Live Strongman Championship 2019 held in Wembley against fellow strongman legend Bill Kazmaier in the Hercules Hold, with the weight being reduced by 20 kg on each side from what the professional athletes were working with. Despite having not competed in a strongman event since 2005, Magnusson stunned the capacity crowd with a time of 101.2 seconds (1m 41.2s), whilst Kazmaier could only manage just over 18 seconds.

===Other===
In 2008, Magnús made an appearance on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. He also appeared in a Coors Light commercial as the &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Man&quot; which aired in the U.S.

Magnús frequently judges international powerlifting and strongman competitions. He owns a powerlifting and strongman gym in Kópavogur called Jakaból (Nest of Giants).

Magnús is the founder of the Magnús Ver Magnússon Strongman Classic, a strongman competition held in Iceland that qualifies the winner for the World&#x27;s Strongest Man. Magnús has 2 daughters and a grandson.

More recently he has launched the Magnús Ver Magnússon Adaptive Strength World Championships where adaptive athletes registered for the World Strength Games are automatically registered to compete. Magnús is also a brand ambassador of HEMPE pain gels which he says help him to recover faster after training.

<doc id="565176" wikidata="Q33005760" url="?curid=565176" title="Narration">
<text>Narration is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a story to an audience. Narration is conveyed by a narrator: a specific person, or unspecified literary voice, developed by the creator of the story to deliver information to the audience, particularly about the plot: the series of events. Narration is a required element of all written stories (novels, short stories, poems, memoirs, etc.), presenting the story in its entirety. It is optional in most other storytelling formats, such as films, plays, television shows and video games, in which the story can be conveyed through other means, like dialogue between characters or visual action.

The narrative mode, which is sometimes also used as synonym for narrative technique, encompasses the set of choices through which the creator of the story develops their narrator and narration:
* &quot;Narrative point of view, perspective,&quot; or &quot;voice&quot;: the choice of grammatical person used by the narrator to establish whether or not the narrator and the audience are participants in the story; also, this includes the scope of the information or knowledge that the narrator presents
* &quot;Narrative tense&quot;: the choice of either the past or present grammatical tense to establish either the prior completion or current immediacy of the plot
* &quot;Narrative technique&quot;: any of the various other methods chosen to help narrate a story, such as establishing the story&#x27;s setting (location in time and space), developing characters, exploring themes (main ideas or topics), structuring the plot, intentionally expressing certain details but not others, following or subverting genre norms, employing certain linguistic styles and using various other storytelling devices.

Thus, narration includes both &quot;who&quot; tells the story and &quot;how&quot; the story is told (for example, by using stream of consciousness or unreliable narration). The narrator may be anonymous and unspecified, or a character appearing and participating within their own story (whether fictitious or factual), or the author themself as a character. The narrator may merely relate the story to the audience without being involved in the plot and may have varied awareness of characters&#x27; thoughts and distant events. Some stories have multiple narrators to illustrate the storylines of various characters at various times, creating a story with a complex perspective.

== Point of view ==
An ongoing debate has persisted regarding the nature of narrative point of view. A variety of different theoretical approaches have sought to define point of view in terms of person, perspective, voice, consciousness and focus. Narrative perspective is the position and character of the storyteller, in relation to the narrative itself. There is, for instance, a common distinction between first-person and third-person narrative, which Gérard Genette refers to as intradiegetic and extradiegetic narrative, respectively. 

===Literary theory===
The Russian semiotician Boris Uspenskij identifies five planes on which point of view is expressed in a narrative: spatial, temporal, psychological, phraseological and ideological. The American literary critic Susan Sniader Lanser also develops these categories.

The psychological point of view focuses on the characters&#x27; behaviors. Lanser concludes that this is &quot;an extremely complex aspect of point of view, for it encompasses the broad question of the narrator&#x27;s distance or affinity to each character and event…represented in the text&quot;. 

The ideological point of view is not only &quot;the most basic aspect of point of view&quot; but also the &quot;least accessible to formalization, for its analysis relies to a degree, on intuitive understanding&quot;. This aspect of the point of view focuses on the norms, values, beliefs and Weltanschauung (worldview) of the narrator or a character. The ideological point of view may be stated outright—what Lanser calls &quot;explicit ideology&quot;—or it may be embedded at &quot;deep-structural&quot; levels of the text and not easily identified.

=== First-person ===

A first-person point of view reveals the story through an openly self-referential and participating narrator. First person creates a close relationship between the narrator and reader, by referring to the viewpoint character with first person pronouns like &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; (as well as &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;, whenever the narrator is part of a larger group). 

=== Second-person ===

The second-person point of view is a point of view similar to first-person in its possibilities of unreliability. The narrator recounts their own experience but adds distance (often ironic) through the use of the second-person pronoun &quot;you&quot;. This is not a direct address to any given reader even if it purports to be, such as in the metafictional &quot;If on a winter&#x27;s night a traveler&quot; by Italo Calvino. Other notable examples of second-person include the novel &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; by Jay McInerney, the short fiction of Lorrie Moore and Junot Díaz, the short story &quot;The Egg&quot; by Andy Weir and &quot;Second Thoughts&quot; by Michel Butor. Sections of N. K. Jemisin&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Season&quot; and its sequels are also narrated in the second person.
Mohsin Hamid&#x27;s &quot;The Reluctant Fundamentalist&quot; and Gamebooks, including the American &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; and British &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series (the two largest examples of the genre), are not true second-person narratives, because there is an implicit narrator (in the case of the novel) or writer (in the case of the series) addressing an audience. This device of the addressed reader is a near-ubiquitous feature of the game-related medium, regardless of the wide differences in target reading ages and role-playing game system complexity. Similarly, text-based interactive fiction, such as &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; and &quot;Zork&quot;, conventionally has descriptions that address the user, telling the character what they are seeing and doing. This practice is also encountered occasionally in text-based segments of graphical games, such as those from Spiderweb Software, which make ample use of pop-up text boxes with character and location descriptions. Most of Charles Stross&#x27;s novel &quot;Halting State&quot; is written in second person as an allusion to this style.

=== Third-person ===

In the third-person narrative mode, the narration refers to all characters with third person pronouns like &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; and never first- or second-person pronouns. 

==== Omniscient or limited ====
&quot;Omniscient&quot; point of view is presented by a narrator with an overarching perspective, seeing and knowing everything that happens within the world of the story, including what each of the characters is thinking and feeling. The inclusion of an omniscient narrator is typical in nineteenth-century fiction, including works by Charles Dickens, Leo Tolstoy and George Eliot.

Some works of fiction, especially novels, employ multiple points of view, with different points of view presented in discrete sections or chapters, including &quot;The English Patient&quot; by Michael Ondaatje, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Children&quot; by Claire Messud and the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series by George R. R. Martin. &quot;The Home and the World&quot;, written in 1916 by Rabindranath Tagore, is another example of a book with three different point-of-view characters. In &quot;The Heroes of Olympus&quot; series, written by Rick Riordan, the point of view alternates between characters at intervals. The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series focuses on the protagonist for much of the seven novels, but sometimes deviates to other characters, particularly in the opening chapters of later novels in the series, which switch from the view of the eponymous Harry to other characters (for example, the Muggle Prime Minister in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;).

Examples of &quot;Limited&quot; or close third-person point of view, confined to one character&#x27;s perspective, include J.M. Coetzee&#x27;s &quot;Disgrace&quot;.

==== Subjective or objective ====
&quot;Subjective&quot; point of view is when the narrator conveys the thoughts, feelings and opinions of one or more characters. &quot;Objective&quot; point of view employs a narrator who tells a story without describing any character&#x27;s thoughts, opinions, or feelings; instead, it gives an objective, unbiased point of view.

=== Alternating- or multiple-person ===

While the tendency for novels (or other narrative works) is to adopt a single point of view throughout the entire novel, some authors have utilized other points of view that, for example, alternate between different first-person narrators or alternate between a first- and a third-person narrative mode. The ten books of the &quot;&quot; adventure series, by D. J. MacHale, switch back and forth between a first-person perspective (handwritten journal entries) of the main character along his journey as well as a disembodied third-person perspective focused on his friends back home.

In Indigenous American communities, narratives and storytelling are often told by a number of elders in the community. In this way, the stories are never static because they are shaped by the relationship between narrator and audience. Thus, each individual story may have countless variations. Narrators often incorporate minor changes in the story in order to tailor the story to different audiences.

The use of multiple narratives in a story is not simply a stylistic choice, but rather an interpretive one that offers insight into the development of a larger social identity and the impact that has on the overarching narrative, as explained by Lee Haring. 

Haring provides an example from the Arabic folktales of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; to illustrate how framing was used to loosely connect each story to the next, where each story was enclosed within the larger narrative. Additionally, Haring draws comparisons between &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot; and the oral storytelling observed in parts of rural Ireland, islands of the Southwest Indian Ocean and African cultures such as Madagascar.&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll do,&quot; said the smith. &quot;I&#x27;ll fix your sword for you tomorrow, if you tell me a story while I&#x27;m doing it.&quot; The speaker was an Irish storyteller in 1935, framing one story in another (O&#x27;Sullivan 75, 264). The moment recalls the Thousand and One Nights, where the story of &quot;The Envier and the Envied&quot; is enclosed in the larger story told by the Second Kalandar (Burton 1: 113-39), and many stories are enclosed in others.&quot;

== Tense==
In narrative past tense, the events of the plot occur before the narrator&#x27;s present. This is by far the most common tense in which stories are expressed. This could be in the narrator&#x27;s distant past or their immediate past, which for practical purposes is the same as their present. Past tense can be used regardless of whether the setting is in the reader&#x27;s past, present, or future.

In narratives using present tense, the events of the plot are depicted as occurring in the narrator&#x27;s current moment of time. A recent example of novels narrated in the present tense are those of the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; trilogy by Suzanne Collins. Present tense can also be used to narrate events in the reader&#x27;s past. This is known as &quot;historical present&quot;. This tense is more common in spontaneous conversational narratives than in written literature, though it is sometimes used in literature to give a sense of immediacy of the actions. Screenplay action is also written in the present tense.

The future tense is the most rare, portraying the events of the plot as occurring some time after the narrator&#x27;s present. Often, these upcoming events are described such that the narrator has foreknowledge (or supposed foreknowledge) of their future, so many future-tense stories have a prophetic tone.

==Technique==

=== Stream-of-consciousness ===

Stream of consciousness gives the (typically first-person) narrator&#x27;s perspective by attempting to replicate the thought processes—as opposed to simply the actions and spoken words—of the narrative character. Often, interior monologues and inner desires or motivations, as well as pieces of incomplete thoughts, are expressed to the audience but not necessarily to other characters. Examples include the multiple narrators&#x27; feelings in William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot;, and the character Offred&#x27;s often fragmented thoughts in Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Irish writer James Joyce exemplifies this style in his novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

=== Unreliable narrator ===

Unreliable narration involves the use of an untrustworthy narrator. This mode may be employed to give the audience a deliberate sense of disbelief in the story or a level of suspicion or mystery as to what information is meant to be true and what is meant to be false. Unreliable narrators are usually first-person narrators; a third-person narrator may also be unreliable. An example is J.D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, in which the novel&#x27;s narrator Holden Caulfield is biased, emotional and juvenile, divulging or withholding certain information deliberately and at times probably quite unreliable.

<text>Francisco de Assis França (March 13, 1966 – February 2, 1997), better known as Chico Science, was a Brazilian singer and composer and one of the founders of the manguebeat cultural movement. He died in a car accident in 1997 in Recife, Pernambuco, at the age of 30.

==Biography==
Francisco de Assis França was born in the Rio Doce neighbourhood of Olinda, Pernambuco, in Brazil&#x27;s Northeast Region. As a little boy he would sell crabs that he caught himself in the city&#x27;s mangrove swamps.

He became the lead singer and major creative driving force of the groundbreaking Mangue Bit band called Chico Science &amp; Nação Zumbi (CSNZ). Influenced by such musicians as James Brown, Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow, their music cleverly fused rock, funk, and hip hop with maracatu and other traditional rhythms of Brazil&#x27;s Northeast. World music critics found his music &quot;original and distinctive of his region.&quot; Chico had a powerful stage presence that was compared by some to that of Jimi Hendrix.

Around 1991, Chico Science, along with singer Fred 04 of the band Mundo Livre S/A, founded the Mangue Bit cultural movement in response to dire economic and cultural stagnation in Recife and Olinda. CSNZ made their US debut at New York&#x27;s Central Park Summerstage in 1995, opening for Gilberto Gil, with whom he collaborated during the encore. While in NY, they also performed additional shows at CBGB&#x27;s, SOB&#x27;s and at Bryant Park as part of the JVC Jazz Festival, on a bill with the Ohio Players.

Chico Science &amp; Nação Zumbi toured several times in Europe and brought massive attention to the new generation of Brazilian artists in the 1990s. With only two full albums released during his lifetime, &#x27;Da Lama Ao Caos&#x27; (&#x27;From Mud To Chaos) and &#x27;Afrociberdelia&#x27;, his influence and vision became the foundation to a whole new generation of musicians in Brazil. At the time of his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he was &quot;widely hailed as the future of Brazilian music.&quot; The Governor of the Brazilian state of Pernambuco declared three days of mourning.

In 1996, Chico Science contributed &quot;Maracatu Atômico&quot; along with Nação Zumbi to the AIDS-Benefit Album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization. Nação Zumbi have continued to record and tour internationally after Chico&#x27;s death.

== Death ==
Chico Science died in a car accident on February 2, 1997. He lost control of his Fiat Uno and hit a side light post after another car cut him off. He was rescued alive but he did not survive his injuries. He was buried on February 3 in Cemitério de Santo Amaro located in Recife. 10 years after his death, his family was compensated by Fiat due to a failure in the seatbelt that could have saved his life.

==Legacy==
In 2008, Rolling Stone Brasil ranked Chico Science as the 16th greatest Brazilian artist in their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time in Brazilian music

<text>Operation Mobilisation (OM) is a Christian missionary organisation founded by George Verwer to mobilise young people to live and share the Gospel of Jesus. OM started in Mexico and had spread to Europe and India by 1963.

OM currently has 6,800 people working in 118 countries around the world, seeking to &quot;see vibrant communities of Jesus followers among the least reached&quot;. OM&#x27;s core values are knowing and glorifying God, living in submission to God&#x27;s Word, being people of grace &amp; integrity, serving sacrificially, loving &amp; valuing people, evangelising the world, reflecting the diversity of the body of Christ, global intercession, and esteeming the church. They accomplish these core values through church planting, evangelism, relief and development, justice, and mentoring and discipleship.

== History ==
George Verwer, OM&#x27;s founder and leader until 2003, received a Gospel of John from a local woman while still in high school in the 1950s. In 1955, Verwer became a Christian at a Billy Graham meeting at Madison Square Garden, and made a commitment to global missions and spreading Christianity on a large scale.

Operation Mobilisation started in 1957 when Walter Borchard, Dale Rhoton and George Verwer traveled to Mexico to distribute Christian literature and Gospels. The Gospels were very important to the men and the beginning of OM&#x27;s long history. The trip in 1957 was the first of three summer trips to Mexico. By 1960, the men turned their attention to Europe, focusing on mobilising the national churches to global missions. Verwer&#x27;s vision for the global mission was that leadership would come from the local Christian community, wherever possible, rather than from foreigners (Randall 2008).

In Summer 1962 OM&#x27;s first short-term missions teams moved into Europe, coming from the UK, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, the US and elsewhere. In the summer of 1963 more than 2,000 people blanketed Europe to encourage Christians and to carry God&#x27;s Word throughout the continent and find creative ways of getting it behind the Iron Curtain. OM teams were also starting in India and the Middle East in 1963 (Randall 2008).

OM and Verwer&#x27;s vision for spreading the Gospel expanded to the seas with the purchase of the ship MV Logos in October 1970. Thereafter OM expanded its ships ministry with the MV &quot;Doulos&quot;, MV &quot;Logos II&quot; and MV &quot;Logos Hope&quot;. In 2023 a fifth ship, MV &quot;Doulos Hope&quot;, was put into service together with MV &quot;Logos Hope&quot;, the previous three having been retired.

Back in Europe, summer conferences were continuing but the number of participants was dwindling. In late 1987, a renewed vision for reaching Europe was born, which led to the “Love Europe” outreaches that started in July 1989, just prior to the fall of the Iron Curtain. OM planned for 5,000 young people from 50 nations to participate; in fact, about 7,000 from 76 nations came. With this first “Love Europe” conference, the vision of OM – birthed in Europe – had been renewed (Randall 2008). OM&#x27;s operations in Europe today includes ministry in more than 30 countries.

On 7 March 2013, OM appointed a new international director, only the third in its nearly 56-year history. Lawrence Tong, from Singapore, took over the OM leadership from Peter Maiden, from the UK, who had served and led in the role since 2003. Lawrence, who has served as director of OM&#x27;s ship Logos II, assumed responsibility on 1 September 2013.

==OM Ships==
Currently, OM Ships operates two ships serving destinations around the world, the MV &quot;Logos Hope&quot; and the MV &quot;Doulos Hope&quot;. These ships are operated in conjunction with GBA Ships, who offers a list of ports of call for both vessels.

Their first ship, &quot;MV Logos&quot;, was purchased in 1970. Over a 17-year period, more than 6.5 million people visited &quot;MV Logos&quot; during 408 ports of call in 108 countries.

OM&#x27;s second ship, the MV &quot;Doulos&quot;, previously held the record for the oldest ocean-going ship still in service. She was retired at the end of 2009.

&quot;MV Logos&quot; ran aground on rocks off Tierra del Fuego, Chile, in atrocious weather conditions in 1988. Although the ship could not be saved, not a single crew member was lost or injured. The skeletal hulk of the ship is still visible and has become something of a tourist attraction over the years.

Later in 1988, the former &quot;MV Antonio Lazaro&quot; became the MV &quot;Logos II&quot;, which was retired in July 2008 after welcoming 11 million visitors.

MV &quot;Logos Hope&quot; was launched into service in 2009. Twice the size of the &quot;MV Doulos&quot;, it provides much greater capacity to serve communities.

MV &quot;Doulos Hope&quot; was purchased in 2022 and launched into service in 2023, and is expected to serve in the Southeast Asia area.

The OM ships have visited port cities throughout the world, supplying literature, encouraging cross-cultural understanding, training young people for more effective life and service, providing relief, and sharing a message of hope in God wherever there is an opportunity. Since 1970, OM&#x27;s ships have visited 480 different ports in 151 countries and territories around the globe.

In total, over 45 million visitors have come aboard to purchase from the selection of 5,000 titles available in the ships&#x27; floating bookstores. Titles cover a wide range of subjects, such as science, sports, hobbies, cookery, the arts, philosophy, medicine and children&#x27;s books, as well as faith and life. The books have been carefully chosen to be of interest to every member of the family, and with the educational, social and moral needs of the local community in mind. Books are on offer at a fraction of their retail value, and, while in certain ports, books are also donated.

As of June 2023, the ships&#x27; timeline is as follows:

<text>Exhibition Place is a publicly owned mixed-use district in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located by the shoreline of Lake Ontario, just west of downtown. The site includes exhibit, trade, and banquet centres, theatre and music buildings, monuments, parkland, sports facilities, and a number of civic, provincial, and national historic sites. The district&#x27;s facilities are used year-round for exhibitions, trade shows, public and private functions, and sporting events.

From mid-August through Labour Day each year, the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), from which the name Exhibition Place is derived, is held on the grounds. During the CNE, Exhibition Place encompasses , expanding to include nearby parks and parking lots. The CNE uses the buildings for exhibits on agriculture, food, arts and crafts, government and trade displays. For entertainment, the CNE provides a midway of rides and games, music concerts at the Bandshell, featured shows at the Coliseum, and the Canadian International Air Show held over Lake Ontario just south of Exhibition Place. The fair is one of the largest and most successful of its kind in North America and an important part of the culture of Toronto. In the fall, the Coliseum hosts the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair.

The buildings on the site date from the 1700s to recent years. Five buildings on the site (the Fire Hall/Police Station, Government Building, Horticulture Building, Music Building and Press Building), were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1988. The grounds have seen a mix of protection for heritage buildings along with new development. The site was originally set aside for military purposes and gradually given over to exhibition purposes. One military building remains.

==The site==

Exhibition Place is a rectangular site located length-wise along the north shoreline of Lake Ontario to the west of downtown Toronto. The site is mostly flat ground sloping down gently to the shoreline. It was originally forested land, and was cleared for military use. Sections east and south of the Stanley Barracks building were filled in the early part of the 20th century. Today, the district is mostly paved, with an area of parkland remaining in its western section. There is a large open paved area in the southern central section, which is used for parking and the temporary amusements of the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE). The site has a variety of historic buildings, open spaces and monuments. The eastern entrance to Exhibition Place is marked by the large ceremonial Princes&#x27; Gates, named for Edward, Prince of Wales, and his brother, Prince George, who visited in 1927. The roads are all named after Canadian provinces and territories except for Princes&#x27; Boulevard, which is the main street east to west. Several of the roads are used for the annual Grand Prix of Toronto car race. South of the grounds is Ontario Place, a theme park built in 1971 on landfill in Lake Ontario, and operated by the government of Ontario.

The site also has a long history of sports facilities on the site, starting with an equestrian track and grandstand. The grandstand eventually was converted for use by music concerts, major league baseball and football teams. The newest sports facility to be built is the soccer-specific stadium, BMO Field. There is also an arena, the Coliseum, home to professional ice hockey. The site was used for several sports venues of the 2015 Pan American Games.

The site is administered by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place, appointed by the City of Toronto. As of 2014, the organization had 133 full-time employees, up to 700 during major events, contributed annually to the City of Toronto, and attracted 5.3 million visitors annually to the site. The grounds are in area.

== History of the grounds ==
The small fort Fort Rouillé was built by French fur traders in 1750–1751 as a trading post on the site of today&#x27;s grounds. The area was an important portage route for Native Americans, and the French wanted to capture their trade before they reached British posts to the south. It was burned by its garrison in 1759 after other French posts fell to the British on Lake Ontario.

When the Town of York, the predecessor of Toronto, was inaugurated in the 1790s, the land to the east and west of the garrison (later Fort York) was reserved for military purposes. This includes all of today&#x27;s Exhibition Place. Years later, the British military decided to replace Fort York with New Fort York (later the Stanley Barracks), to be located to the west of the existing fort. To finance this, the military sold the eastern half of the reserve. In 1840–1841, they constructed a series of six limestone buildings and several smaller ones. The fort was surrounded by a wood fence as elaborate defensive works were never built. The fort was turned over to the Canadian military in 1870, which named it Stanley Barracks in 1893.

The Provincial Agricultural Association and the Board of Agriculture for Canada West inaugurated the Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West in 1846, to be held annually in different localities. For the 1858 fair, to be held in Toronto, a permanent &quot;Palace of Industry&quot; exhibition building, based on London&#x27;s Crystal Palace, was built at King and Shaw Streets in what is now Liberty Village. The site held four more fairs until the 1870s when the City of Toronto government decided the exhibition had outgrown the site. The City signed a lease with the Government of Canada for a section of the western end of the reserve in April 1878. The Palace of Industry was moved to a site on the reserve near today&#x27;s Horticulture Building, reconstructed and expanded. The City sold the King and Shaw site to the Massey Manufacturing Company.

The 1878 Provincial Agricultural Fair was held on the grounds. When Ottawa was chosen to host the 1879 fair, Toronto decided to hold its own fair. First called the Toronto Industrial Exhibition, it was held in the Crystal Palace and temporary buildings. At first, the eastern part of the site was still reserved for military purposes, the exhibition held on the western part of the reserve, where many of the oldest exhibit buildings are located. As time went by, more and more of the reserve was taken over for exhibition purposes, including a horse track and grandstand, and exhibit buildings.

===Development of permanent buildings===

In 1902, after the Government of Canada announced it would sponsor the exhibition at the site in 1903, the Toronto City Council decided to rebuild the exhibition site. In 1903, the Government of Canada reached an agreement to transfer the remaining military reserve to the City of Toronto. Under the agreement, military uses were permitted to continue until such time that replacement facilities were built. Included in this was Old Fort York, which the City committed to preserve. The building campaign saw the building of fifteen permanent buildings designed by architect G. W. Gouinlock from 1903 until 1912, including the surviving Press Building, Horticulture Building, Government Building, Music Building and Fire Hall / Police Station. The new buildings were elaborately designed and set in an attractively landscaped site. The 1903 exhibition was the first known as the Canadian National Exhibition. The five remaining buildings were declared a historic site in 1988.

Several of the older buildings were lost to fire during this time, including the first Grandstand and the Crystal Palace (known as the Transportation Building) in 1906. In 1910, the Dufferin Gates was replaced with a more elaborate arch and out-buildings on each side. 

During World War I, the Government Building was used as a barracks for soldiers, and a tent camp was set up on the site of the current Ontario Government Building (now Liberty Grand). The Dufferin Gates was manned by soldiers. The Stanley Barracks was also used as a prisoners-of-war and &quot;enemy aliens&quot; internment camp. The internment camp served as an intake centre; those interned at the Barracks stayed there temporarily before being moved to other camps.

When the CNE became the world&#x27;s largest annual fair in 1920, a 50-year plan was launched following the urban design and architectural precedents of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Chapman and Oxley prepared the 1920 plan, which emphasized Beaux-Arts architecture and City Beautiful urban design. The Empire Court was to be a monumental central space with a triumphal arch and gates and monumental exhibition buildings with courtyards.

During the 1920s, the exhibition grounds were expanded to the west and to the east, as well as to the south, where reclaimed land was used to build Lake Shore Boulevard (originally &quot;Boulevard Drive&quot;), connecting downtown with Toronto&#x27;s growing western suburbs. The Coliseum, to host the new Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, was opened in 1921, followed by the Government of Ontario Building in 1926, the Princes&#x27; Gates in 1927, and the Electrical and Engineering Building in 1928. By the 1930s, the Beaux-Arts style faded in popularity. The start of the trend for a new style of architecture arguably became evident in the construction of the Automotive Building in 1929, the first building that moved away from the Beaux-Art architecture envisioned by the 1920 plan, mixing clean modern lines with classical ornamentation. In 1931, the Horse Palace was built, replacing temporary stables used for the Winter Fair. The Horse Palace used Art Deco ornamentation. In 1936, the Art Deco Bandshell was constructed for open-air music concerts.

During the Second World War, the exhibition grounds became Toronto&#x27;s main military training grounds. The CNE, and virtually all other non-military uses of the lands ceased. The CNE was not held between 1942 and 1946, when the land and its facilities were turned over to the Department of National Defence as a training ground. The Graphic Arts Building housed Red Cross facilities, the Coliseum became the RCAF Manning Depot, the Horse Palace was used for barracks and the Automotive Building became the shore facility HMCS &quot;York&quot; for the Royal Canadian Navy. After World War II, the buildings were used as a demobilization centre. The CNE would resume again in 1947, as the Canadian military returned the grounds back to its civilian administrators.

=== Post World War II ===
After the military vacated Stanley Barracks, the CNE made plans for the Barracks&#x27; demolition. However, until 1951, the buildings were used for emergency housing. The first phase of demolition in 1951 demolished all of the wooden buildings, leaving only the original stone buildings. In 1953, despite public opposition, three of the remaining four stone buildings were demolished for parking, leaving only the Officers&#x27; Quarters. In 1955, the Quarters found its first CNE use, for Sports Hall of Fame exhibits before being turned into a year-round Maritime Museum in 1959.

A new phase of building construction followed, replacing buildings destroyed by fire, demolished for the Gardiner Expressway, or needed expansions. The new buildings, mostly in the central block of the site, exhibited a new Modernist style of architecture. In 1946, the third Grandstand burned down. In its place was built the fourth Grandstand, a massive concrete construction and monumental cantilevered steel roof was a sharp contrast to the other buildings around it. The Modernist trend continued with the construction of other buildings and monuments typifying the modernist style including the Food Building (1954), the Shell Oil Tower (1955), Queen Elizabeth Building (1957) and the Princess Margaret Fountain (1958).

In the later 1950s, the new six-lane Gardiner Expressway was pushed through the north side of the grounds, cut below grade in the western section of the grounds, and an elevated section in the eastern section. This necessitated the demolition of the Dufferin Gate, the Women&#x27;s Rest building and the Machinery Hall. The new parabolic arch Dufferin Gate was built in 1959. 

On January 3, 1961, the Manufacturer&#x27;s Building and the Women&#x27;s Building (the one built prior to the Queen Elizabeth Building) were destroyed by fire. The buildings were replaced by the Better Living Centre, which came with a distinctive Mondrian-inspired ornament on its roof. In 1961, the Hall of Fame building opened north of the Grandstand to house Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame and the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1963, the Coliseum was re-clad with a modernist south facade. To replace its exhibit in the Ontario Government Building, the Government of Ontario built Ontario Place on artificial islands to the south of Exhibition Place (accessible via two foot bridges).

Coinciding with the opening of the ultra-modern Ontario Place to the south, a new master plan for the Exhibition site was developed in 1971. The 1971 Master Plan was radical, calling for the demolition of many pre-World War II buildings, new Modernist buildings, and a massive central public space with a reflecting pool and fountains on the site of Exhibition Stadium, which was to be relocated. The plan proposed the demolition of the Fire Station, Art Gallery, General Exhibits Building, Railways Building, Government Building, Ontario Government Building, Automotive Building, Transportation Building, Band Shell, Grandstand, Shell Tower and the 1959 Dufferin Gate. A monorail was proposed to move people around the site and to and from the parking lots. It had first been proposed to connect Union Station and the Exhibition Grounds. Dufferin Street was to be connected to Lake Shore Boulevard, a new four-lane road along the north of the site and a new 1800-place parking lot taking the place of buildings to the west of Dufferin.

The plan resulted in some demolition, such as the Electrical and Engineering Building in 1972 (allegedly in poor structural condition) and the General Exhibits Building and Art Gallery, which were in the path of the new road. In 1974, the International Building, (formerly the Transportation Building), to the west of the bandshell, burnt down. It was hosting an exhibit on Spain during the CNE when it caught fire and was destroyed. The building was demolished and not replaced, the site left vacant and has since used mostly as a parking lot. The 1971 plan was abandoned after Exhibition Stadium was redeveloped and enlarged to host Major League Baseball in 1977. The site officially became Exhibition Place, partly in recognition that very little of the site was retained as parklands.

In 1978, to celebrate the centenary of the fair, a copy of the original 1913 music bandstand was built on the site of the original in the park north of the Horticulture Building. North of the park a new structure designed to resemble the 1870s-era exhibition buildings was added. The buildings host mostly children&#x27;s activities during the CNE. The park was renamed Centennial Square and is also used for corporate picnics.

In 1986, the streets were turned into a high-speed open-wheel car racing circuit for the first time. The race, known today as the Honda Indy Toronto, has taken place annually since, and is part of the IndyCar Series. The streets of Exhibition Place are closed off to regular traffic and a closed circuit is made through the grounds and along Lake Shore Boulevard. The race meant the end of the landmark Bulova/Shell Oil observation tower.

In 1987, the Music Building, which had closed due to structural problems, was gutted by fire. The 1907 exterior was restored and a new interior was built.

===New emphasis on year-round use===
In the 1990s, budget pressures on the City of Toronto led to a new emphasis on the self-sufficiency of Exhibition Place. It saw the tear-down of the permanent midway buildings and the Flyer roller coaster. The City planned to charge rent to the midway&#x27;s operator, Conklin Shows, which chose to tear down the buildings instead and set up temporary rides each year for the CNE.

The new National Trade Centre (now the Enercare Centre) trade show building, planned since the 1971 plan, was built on the vacant Electrical Building site to host more and larger trade shows year-round. It incorporated the Coliseum and Annex buildings to create one large exhibit space. In 2003, the Coliseum (now the Coca-Cola Coliseum) was rebuilt and expanded to provide a home for professional ice hockey. It is currently the home of the Toronto Marlies team from October to April each year.

The trend to utilize the grounds year-round to cover the grounds&#x27; expense, continued with the rental of the Arts &amp; Crafts Building to the Medieval Times theatre company, the Ontario Government Building was rented to become event space known as &quot;Liberty Grand&quot;, and the Horticulture Building became a night club known as &quot;Muzik.&quot; The Automotive Building was turned over to private management and is used exclusively for private events and conferences &amp; has become known as the &quot;Beanfield Centre&quot; since 2017 by virtue of a naming rights agreement.

In 1999, Exhibition Stadium, mostly vacant after the opening of the downtown SkyDome stadium, was demolished. The site was vacant until 2007, when the new BMO Field soccer stadium, a public-private partnership, was built on the site to bring Major League Soccer to Toronto. The new soccer stadium also meant the end of the Hall of Fame building. The Hockey Hall of Fame had vacated earlier for downtown Toronto. A portion of the Hall of Fame façade was retained as one of the entrances to the new stadium. As a demonstration project, a WindShare wind turbine was built to the west of the Fort Rouillé site. The wind turbine has since been renamed ExPlace Wind Turbine.

During the 2000s, the Exhibition Place grounds has seen several proposals for new uses. In July 2005, the City of Toronto asked for aquarium proposals from private enterprises. The only two respondents, Ripley Entertainment and Oceanus Holdings, suggested that they would be interested provided the location was closer downtown or had better transit access and parking. When the City of Toronto was considering the construction of a permanent casino, the CNE was the site of several proposals. The aquarium was built next to the CN tower and the City chose not to build a permanent casino.

Two new buildings have been added at Exhibition Place. In the north-west corner, the Toronto Raptors basketball team built the Biosteel Centre (now the OVO Athletic Centre), a practice facility which is shared part-time with the community. In the south-east, along Lake Shore Boulevard, the Hotel X Toronto was constructed on the site of New Fort York. The foundations of several of the New Fort York buildings were revealed as part of the development. The hotel was built to complement the facilities of the Enercare and Allstream Centres. The soccer stadium was recently expanded, and adapted to allow it to host the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts.

===2015 Pan Am and Parapan Games===
In July 2015, Exhibition Place was the site of sporting venues for the 2015 Pan American Games. The collection of sites was referred to as &quot;CIBC Pan Am Park&quot; and each building was given a venue name. The Enercare Centre and Coliseum buildings were used for indoor sports, temporary facilities for beach volleyball were built south of BMO Field and a watercourse laid out on Lake Ontario. As a result of the games, the 2015 Toronto Honda Indy was scheduled in June to allow for time for the site to prepare for the Pan Am Games. As well the site was wound down in time for setup for the 2015 Canadian National Exhibition (scheduled to open August 21).

==Buildings==
While the CNE only lasts for a few weeks at the end of the summer, many major permanent buildings and other structures have been built over the years. Most are used for other purposes throughout the year.

The west end of the grounds is the original site of exhibitions and the oldest buildings are located here. There are five purpose-built fair buildings designed by architect G. W. Gouinlock: the Horticulture Building, built in 1907; the Government Building, built in 1912; the Music Building, built in 1907; the Administration Building, built in 1905; and the Fire Hall/Police Station, built in 1912. Just south of Dufferin Gate is Centennial Square, a green space with a bandstand. The Ontario Government Building was added later in 1926. The Bandshell, modeled after the famed Art Deco Hollywood Bowl was built in 1936, replacing a 1906 bandstand. North of the Bandshell is Bandshell Park, a large open green space for gatherings. Near the Bandshell is the 1790s Scadding Cabin, the only building dating to the 1879 inaugural exhibition. There are two large fountains; the Princess Margaret Fountain and the Shrine Monument Fountain south of the Bandshell. To the west of Bandshell park, the former International Building site is now a parking lot, and there is a parking lot in the north-west corner of the site.

The central block contains more recent 1950-1960s buildings, which are all replacements for earlier buildings, and are larger than the buildings to the west: the Better Living Centre (exhibition space), the Queen Elizabeth Building complex (theatre, exhibition and administration sections) and the Food Building. The BMO Field soccer stadium, built in 2007, is situated on the site of the 1947 Grandstand and the 1961 Halls of Fame building. South of BMO Field is a large open parking lot and midway area. The CNE plans to make the area a public square, and move the parking underground. South of the central section are two pedestrian bridges over Lake Shore Boulevard to the Ontario Place complex.

The east block was the most active area of military usage and retains the only military building left on the site, the Stanley Barracks Officers&#x27; Quarters, dating to the 1840s. The area is a mix of buildings, including the older Coliseum, Horse Palace and newer buildings. The section is dominated by the exhibition complex of the Enercare Centre, Coliseum and the Industry Building. The Horse Palace (which adjoins the Coliseum and is used for equine shows and quartering), the Automotive Building (which was once used for car shows and is now a conference centre) and the General Services Building are all older exhibition buildings dating from the 1920s. The new &quot;Hotel X&quot; project includes a display of foundations of New Fort York which once occupied part of the site.

===Sports venues===
Exhibition Place was also home to Exhibition Stadium, which was built out of the fourth Grandstand by adding two extra wings of seats. The original grandstand had been constructed in the late 1800s and was re-modelled, replaced, or destroyed over the years. It served as home to the CFL&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts between 1958 and 1988 and the Toronto Blue Jays (AL) between 1977 and 1989. The two teams left for SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) in 1989. After it lost many stadium concert tours to Rogers Centre, and many other outdoor concerts to the nearby Budweiser Stage (then known as Molson Amphitheatre) at Ontario Place, its usefulness was at an end. The stadium was demolished in 1999 to serve as parking and allow a more sprawling midway. However, on October 26, 2005, the City of Toronto approved the construction of a 20,000 seat soccer stadium (BMO Field) on Exhibition Place land.

==== Exhibition Stadium (former stadium) ====
The CNE has been host to four grandstands since its inception. The third grandstand, designed by G. W. Gouinlock, was built in 1907 and had a capacity of 16,000. It burned down in 1946, subsequently leading to the construction of the fourth (known as CNE Grandstand), built in 1948. Designed by architects Marani and Morris, this building was the first of what would prove to be several Modernist buildings built on the CNE grounds, its distinctive and bold cantilevered truss roof dominating the grounds for over 50 years. It initially housed 22,000 people, but was expanded over the years to a maximum of 54,000 in order to accommodate the additional seating required for major professional sports teams who made CNE Grandstand their home. It became the home base for the Toronto Argonauts football team, and later, to the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team. Architect Bill Sanford designed the alterations for baseball in 1976.

A stock car race held on the grounds marked a historical race; on July 18, 1958, Richard Petty made his NASCAR Grand National Series debut at Exhibition Stadium.

In addition to sports, CNE Grandstand was the stage for many entertainers over the years. Famous comedians who were featured there included Bob Hope, Victor Borge, and Bill Cosby. Similarly, many well-known musical acts made an appearance at the venue, ranging from Duke Ellington, Guy Lombardo, Benny Goodman, The Beach Boys (appearing there 11 times between 1974 and 1990), The Monkees, Sonny &amp; Cher, to Melissa Etheridge, The Who, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Billy Idol, Nine Inch Nails and Tina Turner. After the grandstand was demolished, open-air concerts during the CNE have been held at the Bandshell.

The Blue Jays and Argos left the open-air Exhibition Stadium for the retractable roofed Skydome (now, the Rogers Centre) in 1989. By that time it was recognized that the building was beginning to visibly decay, and was little used in its final decade of existence. Though it was the earliest of the modernist-style buildings on the grounds, it was the only one not to become a historically listed building. It was finally demolished in 1999.

==== BMO Field (current stadium) ====
In 2007, the open-air BMO Field soccer-specific stadium was constructed on the site of the former Exhibition Stadium and the Canada Sports Hall of Fame buildings. The Hall of Fame building had been vacated by the Hockey Hall of Fame and was demolished to make way for the stadium. The stadium was built to host Toronto FC, the Major League Soccer (MLS) team as well as the Canadian national soccer team. Capacity is approximately 31,000 people. It opened on April 28, 2007, the start of the 2007 MLS season. Under the FIFA-sanctioned name &quot;National Soccer Stadium&quot;, it was the center-piece venue for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. It was expanded for the 2015 season and had a new roof installed for the 2016 season. In conjunction with the stadium construction, Princes&#x27; Boulevard was re-routed to the south of the stadium.

==== Coliseum ====

The Coliseum (1922, now part of the Enercare Centre complex) is an indoor arena. It is an example of Beaux-Arts design by City architect George F. W. Price and renovated by Brisbin Brook Beynon, Architects. Its main entrance was originally to the north, and the building was remodelled with a Modernist façade main entrance to the south in 1963. The original façade was restored when the Enercare Centre was built. It is home to the minor league Toronto Marlies professional ice hockey team during the winter months. Every November, it is used for the &quot;Royal Horse Show&quot; component of the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair annually in November.

==== OVO Athletic Centre ====
In another partnership with Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, the new OVO Athletic Centre (originally known as the Biosteel Centre) was completed in 2016 at the west end of Exhibition Place on parking lot lands. The facility is a practice facility for the Toronto Raptors National Basketball Association team. It has two basketball courts. The facility displaced some parkland, including a baseball diamond on the site used for a CNE tournament.

===Exhibit buildings===
==== Better Living Centre ====

One of the Modernist buildings on the site, the original purpose of the Better Living Centre was to introduce new ranges of consumer goods to the baby boomer generation, making it a &quot;space of encounter between consumer and product&quot;. For many people attending the CNE, the building hosted their first encounters with such technologies as colour television, transistor radios or home computers. It also became the place where people would expect to see the latest models of various consumer goods, ranging from vacuum cleaners to kitchen appliances.

The building&#x27;s stark modernist architecture, made up of large white forms, a vast flat roof and harsh angles, suited its futurist themes. The building was designed by architects Marani, Morris and Allan and was opened by Toronto mayor Nathan Phillips on August 17, 1962. It was built on the former site of the Manufacturers&#x27; building, which burned down in 1961. The new building replaced the exhibit space of the Manufacturers&#x27; Building and the General Exhibit Building.

The CNE no longer uses the Better Living Centre for its original purpose of introducing consumers to the latest and greatest products during the CNE. Instead, it has been divided in two. One-half hosts the CNE Casino for the month of August, while the other half is the &quot;Farm, Food and Fun&quot; pavilion during the CNE.

The building is used at other times of the year for special events. It hosts an indoor amusement park during March Break and a Hallowe&#x27;en exhibit &quot;Screamers&quot; during the month of October.

====Enercare Centre====
The Enercare Centre (1997), along Princes&#x27; Boulevard, has seven exhibit halls with of space. The new building, first known as the National Trade Centre, took over the location of the old TTC streetcar loop and CNE entrance and the open space vacant since the Electrical and Engineering Building was demolished. It is interconnected with the Coliseum and the Industry Building to the north to provide one large, configurable exhibition space. Home to the Toronto International Boat Show, the National Home Show, the One of A Kind Show, and the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair. Designed by architectural teams Zeidler Partnership Architects and Dunlop-Farrow Architects. During the exhibition, the building houses international product displays and animal shows.

====Food Building====
The CNE Food Building (1954) was built to replace the original Pure Food Building (c. 1922 and demolished 1953). It was designed by Richard A. Fisher. Water cascades down the windows of the east and west entrances to the building. At the main entrance and west entrance, bronze fish sculptures were created by Toronto artist Jean Horne in the reflecting pool. The building is used during the CNE for booths run by various restaurants and food companies. The Food Building is used for storage during the rest of the year.

The Modernist building was the first embodiment of this architectural movement on the CNE grounds. Compared to the Pure Food Building, the contemporary building featured higher ceilings and wider aisles, to enable better circulation and comfort for CNE guests. The Food Building&#x27;s Modernist features include its windowless walls, white pre-cast panels with a broomed finish on the face, and troweled borders. The Food Building was designed to showcase the products of Canada&#x27;s food industry, from Laura Secord chocolates to Maple Leaf meats, and Red Rose tea, all of whom had permanent booths in the building.

When the Food Building opened, an stainless-steel pylon graced the south entrance of the building. The inspiration for the pylon came from Trylon, a signature structure at the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair in New York City. The needle was an integral part of the new Food Building&#x27;s design. However, over time, rust and decay eroded the tall pylon and it was dismantled in 1975.

====Queen Elizabeth Building ====

The Queen Elizabeth Building complex (1956) was originally named the Women&#x27;s Building but was rededicated to the new Queen of Canada. The building is composed of three sections: the two-storey administration building, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre, and a one-storey exhibition hall. The structure is clad in brick and the roof is of a unique folded-plate cast-concrete design. It was designed by architect Peter Dickinson and architectural firm Page + Steele Inc. It was renamed in honour of a royal visit.

The offices were once occupied by the CNE Association and Board. The theatre, which has 1300 seats, has been used for radio, variety, and fashion shows and hosts stage productions and concerts. The exhibition hall, which is a large uninterrupted exhibit space is used year-round and is home to arts, crafts, and hobby vendor displays during the CNE.

====The Scadding Cabin====

This one-room cabin is located adjacent to the Fort Rouillé Monument and the CNE Bandshell. It is not only the oldest building on the grounds, but the oldest building in Toronto. It was built by the Queen&#x27;s York Rangers in 1794 on behalf of John Scadding, who served as clerk (essentially, an executive assistant) to the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe. The original cabin was disassembled from its original site and rebuilt by the York Pioneers, along with an adjacent cabin made out of new logs, on the current site, just in time for the original Toronto Industrial Exhibition in 1879.

Scadding was given a plot of land from what is now just north of Gerrard Street East, south to the waterfront. The cabin was built close to the Don River&#x27;s east side, on what is now part of the Don Valley Parkway, just south of Queen Street East. Scadding sold the property in 1818 to William Smith. In 1879, his son William Smith offered the cabin to the York Pioneers, a local historical society. Around this time, someone mistook the information concerning the original owner for the cabin, leading to it being erroneously called &quot;The Governor Simcoe cabin&quot;. John Scadding&#x27;s youngest son, Henry Scadding wrote an early history of York/Toronto and set the record straight on who the original owner of the cabin was. When he died in 1901, the York Pioneers renamed it &quot;The Scadding Cabin&quot;, in honour of this son of the original owner, who had also been a past president of their society.

It is a squat, two-storey log cabin with low ceilings, designed to retain the heat from the fire in winter close to its occupants. It is said that John Graves Simcoe, who was over tall, had to stoop in order to enter the building. The building as it now stands is little changed from its original construction. Apparently an additional extension that would have appeared to the south of the building was not moved. The second cabin constructed next to it by the York Pioneers was built using wood that was too green, and it was demolished a few years after construction. Over the years some of the timbers have been replaced, and the cabin was remounted on a stone foundation in the late part of the 20th century. Inside the cabin are furnishings appropriate to a house in Upper Canada in the 1830s, and some known to have belonged to Simcoe.

===Music and entertainment venues===

==== Bandshell ====
Inspired by the Hollywood Bowl, the Art Deco-styled Bandshell on the CNE grounds was built in 1936 according to designs prepared by the Toronto architectural firm of Craig and Madill. It is situated on the west side of the grounds, and over the years has been host to many famous acts, including Guy Lombardo, Louis Armstrong, The Guess Who, and Joni Mitchell. More recently the likes of Susan Aglukark, Moxy Früvous, and Bob Newhart have played the open air venue. The adjacent park is known as Bandshell Park. In the north-east corner is the Exhibition Place Carillon. To the south-east of the bandshell is the &quot;Garden of the Greek Gods&quot; collection of sculptures.

====Queen Elizabeth Theatre====

The Queen Elizabeth Theatre, opened in 1956, is a 1,250-seat auditorium, and is a part of the Queen Elizabeth building complex. It is leased to the operator of the Mod Club in Toronto and it is used for concerts and shows throughout the year.

===Gates and monuments===
==== Dufferin Gates ====

The Dufferin Gates is the westernmost ceremonial entranceway to the CNE grounds. Named after Lord Dufferin, the original set of gates to the CNE grounds was named in his honour, situated at the bottom of Dufferin Street, also named after the same person. The original gateway was erected in 1895 and was superseded by a more permanent, ornate Beaux-Arts style triumphal arch built in 1910, and officially re-opened by Lord Dufferin in 1914.

With the construction of Toronto&#x27;s Gardiner Expressway in 1956, the 1910 gates were demolished in order to make way for the roadway. In their place, a modernist-style parabolic arch was erected south of the previous gates in 1956, designed by architect Philip R. Brook. The current arch is built around a steel frame and concrete, with brick at the base. It is high and spans in width. It is similar in design to the much larger Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, but predates it. The star decoration that hangs from the top of the arch was added during Canada&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 1967. The Gate is a listed heritage structure. A plaque from the Ontario Heritage Foundation commemorating the history of the CNE can be found just inside the gate.

==== Princes&#x27; Gates ====
The monumental Princes&#x27; Gates were officially opened by Princes Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), and Prince George (later the Duke of Kent), on August 31, 1927, during that year&#x27;s CNE. The gates were built in the Beaux-Arts style to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Canadian Confederation and were originally to be called &quot;The Diamond Jubilee of Confederation Gates&quot;. The name was changed when it was found that the princes were touring Canada the year of its dedication. The first to pass through the gate was a parade of 15,000 veterans in the annual Warriors&#x27; Day Parade.

=====Fort Rouillé Monument=====
A large obelisk, built in 1887, marks the spot where the original French-built Fort Rouillé was erected in 1750 and 1751. Its construction was ordered by the Marquis de la Jonquière, then governor of New France, in order to further establish a French presence in the area, and to intercept the trade of Indians travelling towards an English fur-trading post in present-day Oswego. It was a small palisaded fort with a bastion at each of its four corners, and containing five main buildings: a corps de garde, storeroom, barracks, blacksmithy, and a building for the officers. A drawing purported to date from 1749 shows the fort adjacent to Lake Ontario, whereas today it is situated on top of a small hill a hundred metres or so from the lake&#x27;s current shoreline.

The fort was abandoned and burned by the French garrison in July 1759, who were retreating from invading English forces. Vestiges of the fort remained for many years afterwards, and it was the site of a firefight in the War of 1812. The site was graded over and sodded in preparation for the establishment of the Toronto Industrial Exhibition in 1879.

The grounds were excavated in 1979 and 1980 by the Toronto Historical Board, and again in 1982 by the Youth Committee of the Toronto Sesquicentennial Board. The outline of the original fort has been marked out in concrete around the obelisk. Two commemorative plaques — one in English, and one in French — are attached to the base of the obelisk, placed there by the Ontario Heritage Foundation. To the north, a third plaque commemorates the excavation done on the site, and to the west, a fourth plaque commemorates a visit to the site by Bertrand Delanoë, mayor of Paris, on September 6, 2003.

=====Shrine Peace Memorial=====
This monument, depicting a winged angel holding aloft a crown of olive branches and standing upon a globe held aloft by female sphinxes, was presented to the people of Canada on June 12, 1930, by the Ancient Arabic Order Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (better known as the Shriners) as a symbol of peace and friendship between the United States and Canada. It is also meant as &quot;an ongoing reminder that Freemasonry actively promotes the ideals peace, harmony, and prosperity for all humankind&quot;. It is situated immediately south of the Bandshell, and is the focal point of the surrounding rose garden.

===Other buildings and structures===
* The Automotive Building (1929), was designed by local architect Douglas Kertland in the Art Deco style. It is a two-storey building, in size. The internal plan is a large open space with a mezzanine on the second floor surrounding the main floor. It was originally constructed for the display of automobiles during the CNE. Management of the building was turned over to private management in 2009 and renovated to house the Allstream, now the Beanfield Centre meetings facility. The open floor was converted to a ballroom, claimed to be largest in Toronto, which can be sub-divided in two. The original glass roof over the open floor was replaced with a new ceiling. The second floor mezzanine saw the addition of 20 meeting rooms.
* The Fire Hall &amp; Police Station (1912) is a Tudor Revival building, designed by G. W. Gouinlock. It is used by Toronto Police Service, Toronto Fire Services and Toronto EMS during the CNE.
* The CNE General Services Building was built in 1901 as the Strachan Avenue Power Station and turned over to Ontario Hydro in 1910. It has been enlarged several times. Since 1959 it is a CNE Building and is now used to house the CNE Archives and various trades as well as a power substation.

* The Government Building was also known as the Arts, Crafts and Hobbies Building. It is a Beaux-Arts structure that was built in 1911. Designed by G. W. Gouinlock, it is similar in style to the Horticulture Building. Since 1993, the building has been used by Medieval Times as the Toronto location of its chain of dinner theatres.
* The Horse Palace (1931) was built to provide stables for the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair. The Art Deco building, designed by City architect James John Woolnough, was considered the best equestrian facility in Canada when it was built. Its façade has been described as one of the finest Art Deco buildings in the City of Toronto and possibly in the province and/or nation. The Art Deco elements of the Horse Palace include a hard-edged angular composition, cubist forms and strong horizontal and vertical planes. The low-relief sculptured friezes of horses located on the exterior of the building are also indicative of the Art Deco style of design. It is also the permanent home of the Toronto Police Service Mounted Unit, a branch of City of Toronto Animal Services and a riding academy.
* The Horticulture Building, designed by G. W. Gouinlock, was built in 1907 to replace the Crystal Palace. It is similar in style (Beaux-Arts) to the Government Building, but without the towers at the sides. The building was used as a temporary morgue the day after a fire destroyed the SS Noronic in 1949. It houses the Toronto Event Centre.
* The Music Building (1907) was constructed as the Railways Building, designed for the Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific Railways by CNE architect G. W. Gouinlock. In 1968, the building was used for music competitions and soon became known as the Music Building. It was nearly destroyed by a fire in 1987 however the exterior was restored to its original condition. It is built in a Beaux-Arts style. It houses the Toronto Fashion Incubator.

* The Ontario Government Building (1926) houses the Liberty Grand banquet hall and events building. The Beaux-Art structure was designed by Chapman and Oxley. It formerly housed exhibits about Ontario.
* The Press Building, originally named the Administrative Building at its inception in 1905, until 1957 it was home to the CNE Association. In 1957 it was renamed the Press Building and it became the headquarters for the various media that would attend and report upon the annual fair. Additional telephone and press wire equipment was installed to handle the demand placed on it by the media. More recently the building has returned to its original function as home to the administrators of the CNE. This building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by architect G.W. Gouinlock, who went on to design several buildings on the grounds. A plaque dedicated to his work stands in front of the Press Building. It was once part of a formal plaza that originally boasted the Gooderham Fountain, also designed by Gouinlock, since replaced by the Princess Margaret Fountain in 1958. The Press Building, along with the nearby Fire Hall, Police Station, Railways (Music) Building, Horticulture, and Government buildings, are collectively designated Early Exhibition Buildings National Historic Site. Tours of the building are available.
* The Officers&#x27; Quarters was a part of New Fort York and is the only remaining military building on the site. It is located along Lake Shore Boulevard to the west of the Automotive Building. Closed, it is planned to reopen with a pub and beer garden. It housed the Marine Museum from 1957 until 1998.

* Hotel X Toronto is a thirty-story hotel, located along Lake Shore Boulevard just west of the Automotive Building. The area was used as a parking lot for use during the CNE. It is divided into two buildings: the main hotel tower and a sports club building. Hotel X Toronto is a Silver &quot;Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design&quot; (LEED) certified project.

====Structures====
*CNE Flagpole, erected in 1977, to replace the original flagpole installed in 1930. Atop the CNE Flagpole is a copper ball with a time capsule with materials from the 1930 and 1977 installations. The copper ball was manufactured by James Gow and Company of Toronto and is the same one that sat atop the 1930 flagpole.
*McGillivray Fountain 1968, stands in Centennial Park, in the north-western end of the grounds, a modern-art concrete sculpture creation dedicated to a former president of the Exhibition. Designed by sculptor Gerald Gladstone.
* Princess Margaret Fountain (1958) designed by Design Craft, was opened by Princess Margaret on July 31, 1958.
*Sky Ride, a cable car ride introduced at the 2012 CNE in the spirit of the Alpine Way.
*ExPlace Wind Turbine, a 91-metre windmill belonging to WindShare co-operative, erected on December 18, 2002, is the first wind turbine installed in a major North American urban city centre. The turbine production capacity helps displace up to 380 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, which is the equivalent of taking 1,300 cars off the road or planting 30,000 trees each year.

===Demolished buildings and attractions===

* Business Equipment Building, built in 1900.
* Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, built 1961 as the joint home of Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame and the Hockey Hall of Fame. The latter moved in 1993, and the Sports Hall was partially demolished in 2006, with remaining sections to be incorporated into BMO Field, a new soccer stadium. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Allward and Gouinlock, the successor firm to the firm of G. W. Gouinlock, which designed several of the older buildings.
* The Crystal Palace (later known as Transportation Building) was a large exhibit building on the site of the current Horticulture Building, dating to the 1850s. It was moved to the Exhibition Grounds and used for various displays. It was destroyed by fire in 1906.
*The Electrical and Engineering Building was built in 1928. The building was demolished in 1972 and the site is now occupied by the Enercare Centre.
* The General Exhibits Building, built in 1906, was demolished in 1962. The site is now occupied by the Children&#x27;s Midway.
* The Graphic Arts Building was located on the site of the current Queen Elizabeth office building.
* The Machinery Hall, located on the north side of the grounds, was one of the buildings demolished around 1960 for the Gardiner Expressway. 
* The Manufacturers&#x27; Building was a building used to house exhibits of household appliances, fixtures, and furnishings. Built in 1902, it burned down on January 3, 1961, and was replaced by the Better Living Centre.

; Attractions
* Alpine Way - An aerial lift that allowed visitors to view the Ex from west of the Food Building to west of the Automotive Building. The system consisted of four rows of cars (blue, green and red) carrying four passengers. The system was taken down in 1996 and placed into storage in 1998. This was the last of the permanent attractions built by Conklin Shows, and Jim Conklin described the dismantling of the attraction as a &quot;heartbreak&quot;. Sam Sniderman shared equal sadness in the removal of the attraction, so much that he bought the ride sign and donated it to the CNE archives.
* original Dufferin Gate - replaced by the current gate in 1959; previous gates built in 1895 and again in 1910.
* Gooderham Fountain - built in 1910 and replaced by the Princess Margaret Fountain in 1958.
* Mighty Flyer- a wooden roller coaster, built in 1953 by Conklin Shows. It was a permanent fixture that lasted until 1992.
* Shell Oil Tower (later known as the Bulova Tower) = Built in 1955, it was demolished in 1985. The Shell Oil Tower was designed by 24-year-old George A. Robb, who had won a competition by Shell to design the tower. It was a see-through structure of glass and steel with an observation platform at above the ground. The tower was demolished to make way for the Indy race, which paid the cost of demolition. It had been closed the previous two years due to safety concerns.

==Race course==
Since 1986, Exhibition Place has hosted American open-wheel car racing, currently sanctioned by IndyCar and run as the Ontario Honda Dealers Indy Toronto. The race is held annually in July. In addition to the IndyCar race, several support races are held, including Indy NXT and the NASCAR Canada Series, as well as vendor exhibits, concerts, and other off-track activities. The track layout uses local roads that wind through and around Exhibition Place and is commonly referred to as the &quot;Streets of Toronto&quot; circuit. The race festival takes place on a weekend, with the roads closed from Thursday until Monday.

The start/finish line is located on Princes&#x27; Boulevard, slightly west of Newfoundland Drive. From the Start/Finish line, drivers head east towards the Princes&#x27; Gates, turning right (south) onto Canada Boulevard before reaching the gate. From Canada Boulevard, the track goes right onto Lake Shore Boulevard (west) which comprises the longest straightaway on the circuit (this straightaway is sometimes incorrectly referred to as Shoreline Drive during race telecasts; Shoreline Drive is the start-finish straight at the Grand Prix of Long Beach). Drivers re-enter the Exhibition grounds at Ontario Drive, heading north towards Prince&#x27;s Boulevard where they turn left (west). The circuit continues on to Manitoba Drive and heads north-east then east until reaching Nova Scotia Avenue. At Nova Scotia Avenue, drivers turn right (south) then navigate a left-right-left series of turns until rejoining Prince&#x27;s Boulevard and heading east towards the start/finish line.

Exhibition Place is one of seven Canadian circuits to have held an Indy/Champ Car race, the others being Mosport, Concord Pacific Place in Vancouver, Edmonton City Centre Airport, Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Circuit Mont-Tremblant, and Sanair Super Speedway.

==Transportation==
===Public transit===

Exhibition Place is served by city and regional public transit systems by commuter rail, streetcar and bus routes provided by GO Transit and the TTC year-round. There are two access points: north of the Horse Palace (Exhibition Loop and Exhibition GO Station), and north of the Dufferin Gate at the Dufferin Gate Loop.

The TTC serves Exhibition Place with three streetcar routes and one bus route. The Harbourfront and Bathurst Street streetcar lines serve the Exhibition Loop terminus, connecting Exhibition Place with Toronto subway system&#x27;s and Union stations. Exhibition Place is also served by the King streetcar, sharing the Dufferin Gate Loop with the Dufferin bus (routes 29 and 929). The Dufferin bus route loops through Exhibition Place most of the year and terminates at the Dufferin Gate Loop terminus during the CNE. The Dufferin routes 29 and 929 connect with the subway&#x27;s Dufferin station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth.

The Exhibition GO Station is on the Lakeshore route of the commuter rail GO Transit system, providing a connection to Union Station and points east and west. The route stops year-round at the station. The station is being upgraded to also include the terminus of the light metro Ontario Line, which will connect Exhibition Place with downtown and the Toronto subway system. It is expected to open in 2031.

The first streetcar terminus began operations in 1916 and was located at the current loop location along Manitoba Drive, north of the Coliseum. In 1923, the loop was relocated to the south of the Coliseum. To accommodate the construction of the National Trade Centre, it was relocated back to its original location in 1996. The GO station is the second rail station to serve the fair. Its original location was just north of the Dufferin Gate, and only operated during the CNE.

===Roads and gates===

Princes&#x27; Boulevard starts at the Princes&#x27; Gate and extends west to the south of BMO Field and continues west to the Princess Margaret Fountain. Canada Boulevard runs north–south to the west of the Princes&#x27; Gate. In 1973, the rest of the roads on the grounds were named for most of the provinces and territories of Canada.

* Alberta Circle - short street connecting British Columbia Drive with Yukon Place and a short stub at Dufferin Street next to Medieval Times
* British Columbia Road - road begins at the foot of Dufferin Street and ends at Western entrance/exit merging with westbound Lake Shore Boulevard West
* Manitoba Drive - long east–west street along the north end of the Exhibition grounds from Strachan Avenue to Princes&#x27; Boulevard. Easterly section was once called Exhibition Road. 
* Newfoundland Road - short north–south road on the west side of Automotive Building connecting Princes&#x27; Boulevard to Lake Shore Boulevard West
* New Brunswick Way - connects Nunavut Road to Remembrance Drive at Ontario Place
* Nova Scotia Avenue - short road from Manitoba Drive to Princes&#x27; Boulevard
* Nunavut Road - newest street (formerly part of New Brunswick Way) begins and ends at Nova Scotia Avenue
* Ontario Drive - short street connecting Princes Boulevard with Prince Edward Island Crescent
* Prince Edward Island Crescent - semi circular street behind Better Living Centre and connects with Ontario Drive and Princes Boulevard
* Quebec Street - short stub behind Queen Elizabeth Building connecting to Manitoba Drive; eastern end to Nova Scotia Avenue cut off by BMO Field
* Saskatchewan Road - connects British Columbia Rd to the intersection of Prince Edward Island Crescent and Princes&#x27; Boulevard
* Yukon Place - short road behind Liberty Grand and Medieval Times

Northwest Territories is not used as a street name at Exhibition Place.

Other gates in the park outside of Princes&#x27; and Dufferin Gates lack formal structure and are merely entrances with traffic lights:

* British Columbia Gate - formerly Confederation Gate
* Ontario Gate
* Newfoundland Gate
* Manitoba Gate

Former roads:

Exhibition Road was a short east–west road that ran from Strachan Avenue north of the Coliseum buildings to connect the exhibition site to Strachan, which at the time ran no further south. Fort Rouillé Street, of which a stub still exists north of the rail tracks, once extended into the Exhibition grounds to the lake shore. The street was cut off by the construction of the rail cut to move the rail lines below grade. The stub still existing within the grounds was later named Alberta Circle.

<text>Teide, or Mount Teide, (, , &#x27;Peak of Teide&#x27;) is a volcano on Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Spain. Its summit (at ) is the highest point in Spain and the highest point above sea level in the islands of the Atlantic. If measured from the ocean floor, its height of makes Teide the third-highest volcano in the world, UNESCO and NASA rank it as Earth&#x27;s third-tallest volcanic structure. Teide&#x27;s elevation above sea level makes Tenerife the tenth highest island in the world.
Teide started forming 170,000 years ago due to volcanic activity following a catastrophic landslide. Teide&#x27;s base is situated in Las Cañadas crater (the remains of an older, eroded, extinct volcano) at a height of around above sea level. Teide is an active volcano: its most recent eruption occurred in late 1909 from the El Chinyero vent on the northwestern Santiago rift. The United Nations Committee for Disaster Mitigation designated Teide a Decade Volcano because of its history of destructive eruptions and its proximity to several large towns, of which the closest are Garachico, Icod de los Vinos and Puerto de la Cruz. Teide, Pico Viejo and Montaña Blanca form the Central Volcanic Complex of Tenerife.

The volcano and its surroundings make up Teide National Park, which has an area of and was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. Teide is the most visited natural wonder of Spain, the most visited national park in Spain and Europe and, by 2015, the eighth most visited in the world, with some 3 million visitors yearly. In 2016, it was visited by 4,079,823 visitors and tourists, reaching a historical record. Teide Observatory, a major international astronomical observatory, is located on the slopes of the mountain.

== Name and legends ==
Before the 1496 Spanish colonization of Tenerife, the native Guanches referred to a powerful figure living in the volcano, which carries light, power and the sun. &quot;El Pico del Teide&quot; is the modern Spanish name.

Teide was a sacred mountain for the aboriginal Guanches, so it was considered a mythological mountain, as Mount Olympus was to the ancient Greeks. When going on to Teide during an eruption, it was customary for the Guanches to light bonfires to scare Guayota. Guayota is often represented as a black dog, accompanied by his host of demons (Tibicenas).

The Guanches also believed that Teide held up the sky. Many hiding places found in the mountains contain the remains of stone tools and pottery. These have been interpreted as being ritual deposits to counter the influence of evil spirits, like those made by the Berbers of Kabylie. The Guanches believed the mountain to be the place that housed the forces of evil and the most evil figure, Guayota.

Guayota shares features similar to other powerful deities inhabiting volcanoes, such as the goddess Pele of Hawaiian mythology, who lives in the volcano Kīlauea and is regarded by the native Hawaiians as responsible for the eruptions of the volcano. The same was true for the ancient Greeks and Romans, who believed that Vulcano and Mount Etna were chimneys of the foundry of the fire god Hephaestus (Vulcan in Latin).

In 1492, when Christopher Columbus arrived at the island of Tenerife, his crew claimed to see flames coming from the highest mountain of the island (Teide).

==Geography==
===Location===
Teide is located on Tenerife, the largest island of the Canary Islands, situated in the Atlantic Ocean, northwest of the coast of Western Sahara. The volcano is located in a central position on the Tenerife island. Administratively, the Canary Islands are a Spanish autonomous community. Teide itself is located within the commune of La Orotava in the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

===Topography===

Before reliable measurements were available, Teide was considered by Europeans to be the highest mountain on Earth for a long time. With a height of , it is the highest point in Spain and the Atlantic Ocean. If it is measured from the ocean floor, it surpasses , making it the third highest volcanic structure in the world after Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, both on the island of Hawaii.
The formation of the mountain is marked by its long and complex volcanic history. It rests on the Las Cañadas caldera, an asymmetric depression in diameter in the form of a horseshoe which opens to the north. The floor of the caldera varies from in altitude, although its sides in the south rise to , the level of Mount Guajara. To the north, the slopes of Teide continue directly to the ocean, with a break in the slope at around . The volcano of Teide itself can be described as a volcanic cone in diameter at its base, with quite steep slopes, approximately 20 to 40° for a total volume of . The summit is marked by a small volcanic cone, about high, named , which has a summit crater in diameter and deep. A secondary cone, named Pico Viejo emerges on the western slopes of the main peak; its crater is much larger, with a diameter of and a depth of . It rises to , but with a low prominence, not more than higher than the slopes of the main volcano. On the outside of these two main peaks, the relief Teide also has some smaller formations, of which the most notable are , , and , situated next to the base of Teide.

The slopes of Teide are covered in radial ravines. However, the majority of the ravines have been covered by recent lava flows, the , in particular the northern part. The main ravines, with prominence around , are located on the south slope: from east to west, the , and .

===Climate===
Despite their proximity to the Sahara, the Canary Islands have a relatively temperate climate. The sunshine duration is very high due to Teide&#x27;s subtropical latitude and proximity to the Azores high, as well as a very high UV index caused by the height of the peak (greater than 11 in the middle of the summer). This sunshine of around 3,450 h per year is partially compensated by the Canary current, a relatively cold ocean current which makes the climate more temperate. The situation at the level of Teide and its caldera is very unlike the climate at its base. In effect, the climate of Tenerife is marked by an inversion layer around at an altitude of , isolating the high-altitude zones from ocean influences present at the lower altitudes. This leads to a more continental climate on Teide, with strong changes in temperature over the course of the day (typically on the order of 15 °C) and in the course of the year (with a range of -15 °C in winter to 30 °C in the summer).

Humidity is also very affected by this inversion layer. The presence of the Azores high in the northwest of the Canaries in summer induces relatively constant winds (trade winds) blowing from the northeast to the southwest. These winds carry moisture across the Atlantic and deliver rain to the north of Tenerife, forming in particular a dense layer of clouds between of altitude. But the inversion layer also stops these clouds from rising, and the climate is thus very dry below the level of Teide. The precipitation in the caldera is thus less than 500 mm per year, the majority falling in the winter, and in total, around one third in the form of snow. Variation can be quite high from one year to the next. Meanwhile the peak of Teide is covered by wave clouds, forming the &quot;hat of Teide&quot; () which was probably confused with signs of an eruption by sailors.

==Geology==

===The Canary Islands===
Teide is a stratovolcano created by the same forces which formed the Canary Islands. The islands are aligned relatively east to west, but continue to the northeast in a series of undersea mountains which are part of the same volcanic region as the Canary Islands. Dating indicates that the age of these islands changes from east to west, with the older islands and undersea mountains (seamounts) to the east and more recent ones to the west. This makes Fuerteventura and Lanzarote the oldest islands, from 20.2 Mya, and El Hierro the youngest, from 1.1 Mya. Counting the undersea mountains, Lars (a seamount) is the oldest, from 68 Mya. The Madeira islands, located not far to the north of the Canary islands and also volcanic, have many islands and undersea mountains aligned in the same general direction and with similar dates. This pattern is consistent with archipelagoes which have formed over a hotspot such as the Hawaiian Islands. However, there are many differences with Hawaii. First, the Hawaiian Islands are sinking rapidly (in geological time) into the ocean, forming atolls, yet the rate of subsidence is insignificant in the Canary Islands. If the Canary islands were sinking at the same rate as the Hawaiian islands, Teide would be actually below sea-level. But one of the most fundamental differences, and which lends doubt to the theory of a hotspot, is the fact that the volcanic activity is not constrained to the most recent island, but continues through all the islands in the chain. This has aroused an intense debate in the scientific community, which continues to a certain extent today. One hypothesis which allows reconciliation of these observations is the presence in the Earth&#x27;s mantle of a convection cell which enters one part of the magma more towards the east, thus activating the old islands. According to this hypothesis, the magma would be also responsible for scattered volcanic activity to the northwest of the African continent to the south of Spain.

===Formation of Tenerife===
The formation of Tenerife began a little less than 12 Mya. It started with the formation of a shield volcano centered not far from Teide itself, with volcanic activity which endured to around 8.9 Mya. The volcanic activity then stopped, and the volcano underwent some collapses in the process of erosion. One new shield volcano formed between 6 and 5 Mya, more to the west, in Teno then another in Anaga, to the east, between 4.9 and 3.9 Mya. Together, these three shield volcanoes represent 90% of the volume of Tenerife. The lavas are basalts, basic rocks (i.e. having a low content of silica) and therefore very fluid, this explains the characteristic form of shield volcanoes.

Around 3.5 Mya, after a pause of 5.5 million years, volcanic activity resumed to the level of the first shield volcano. This is the start of the rejuvenation phase, forming the volcano Las Cañadas. It was also in this period that the volcanic activity began in the rifts of the island, formed by radial fractures due to the thrust of magma in the central volcano. The eruptions of Las Cañadas were initially basic and fluid lavas, but they differentiated over time (trachybasalts and phonolites), which gave place to more explosive eruptions. Around 200,000 years ago, the peak of the volcano was swept away in a giant land slide to the north, forming the caldera of Las Cañadas. These massive landslides were quite frequent and were in part cased by the fractures of the rifts. Besides the caldera, the landslides were also responsible for the valley of (around 600,000 years ago) and Güímar (around 850,000 years ago).

=== Formation of Teide ===
The stratovolcanoes Teide and Pico Viejo (Old Peak, although it is in fact younger than Teide) are the most recent centres of activity on the volcanic island of Tenerife, which is the largest () and highest () island in the Canaries. It has a complex volcanic history. The formation of the island and the development of the current Teide volcano took place in the five stages shown in the diagram on the right.

==== Stage one ====
Like the other Canary Islands, and volcanic ocean islands in general, Tenerife was built by accretion of large shield volcanoes, three of which developed in a relatively short period. This early shield stage volcanism formed the bulk of the emerged part of Tenerife. The shield volcanoes date back to the Miocene and early Pliocene and are preserved in three isolated and deeply eroded massifs: Anaga (to the northeast), Teno (to the northwest) and Roque del Conde (to the south). Each shield was apparently constructed in less than three million years, and the entire island in about eight million years.

==== Stages two and three ====
The initial juvenile stage was followed by a period of 2–3 million years of eruptive quiescence and erosion. This cessation of activity is typical of the Canaries; La Gomera, for example, is currently at this stage. After this period of quiescence, the volcanic activity became concentrated within two large edifices: the central volcano of Las Cañadas, and the Anaga massif. The Las Cañadas volcano developed over the Miocene shield volcanoes and may have reached in diameter and in height.

==== Stage four ====
Around 160–220 thousand years ago the summit of the Las Cañadas I volcano collapsed, creating the Las Cañadas (Ucanca) caldera. Later, a new stratovolcano, Las Cañadas II, formed in the vicinity of Guajara and then catastrophically collapsed. Another volcano, Las Cañadas III, formed in the Diego Hernandez sector of the caldera. All of the Las Cañadas volcanoes attained a maximum altitude similar to that of Teide (which is sometimes referred to as the Las Cañadas IV volcano).

Two theories on the formation of the caldera exist. The first states that the depression is the result of a vertical collapse of the volcano triggered by the emptying of shallow magma chambers at around sea level under the Las Cañadas volcano after large-volume explosive eruptions. The second theory is that the caldera was formed by a series of lateral gravitational collapses similar to those described in Hawaii. Evidence for the latter theory has been found in both onshore observations and marine geology studies.

==== Stage five ====
From around 160,000 years ago until the present day, the stratovolcanoes of Teide and Pico Viejo formed within the Las Cañadas caldera.

== Historical eruptions ==
Teide last erupted in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent, on the Santiago Ridge. Historical volcanic activity on the island is associated with vents on the Santiago or northwest rift (Boca Cangrejo in 1492, Montañas Negras in 1706, Narices del Teide or Chahorra in 1798, and El Chinyero in 1909) and the Cordillera Dorsal or northeast rift (Fasnia in 1704, Siete Fuentes and Arafo in 1705). The 1706 Montañas Negras eruption destroyed the town and principal port of Garachico, as well as several smaller villages.

Historical activity associated with the Teide and Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes occurred in 1798 from the Narices del Teide on the western flank of Pico Viejo. Eruptive material from Pico Viejo, Montaña Teide and Montaña Blanca partially fills the Las Cañadas caldera. The last explosive eruption involving the central volcanic centre was from Montaña Blanca around 2000 years ago. The last eruption within the Las Cañadas caldera occurred in 1798 from the Narices del Teide or Chahorra (Teide&#x27;s Nostrils) on the western flank of Pico Viejo. The eruption was predominantly strombolian in style and most of the lava was ʻaʻā. This lava is visible beside the Vilaflor–Chio road.

Christopher Columbus reported seeing &quot;a great fire in the Orotava Valley&quot; as he sailed past Tenerife on his first voyage to the New World in 1492. This was interpreted as indicating that he had witnessed an eruption there. Radiometric dating of possible lavas indicates that in 1492 no eruption occurred in the Orotava Valley, but one did occur from the Boca Cangrejo vent.

The last summit eruption from Teide occurred about the year 850 AD, and this eruption produced the &quot;Lavas Negras&quot; or &quot;Black Lavas&quot; that cover much of the flanks of the volcano.

About 150,000 years ago, a much larger explosive eruption occurred, probably of Volcanic Explosivity Index 5. It created the Las Cañadas caldera, a large caldera at about above sea level, around from east to west and from north to south. At Guajara, on the south side of the structure, the internal walls rise as almost sheer cliffs from . The summit of Teide itself, and its sister stratovolcano Pico Viejo (), are both situated in the northern half of the caldera and are derived from eruptions later than this prehistoric explosion.

==Future eruptions==
Future eruptions may include pyroclastic flows and surges similar to those that occurred at Mount Pelée, Merapi, Vesuvius, Etna, the Soufrière Hills, Mount Unzen and elsewhere. During 2003, there was an increase in seismic activity at the volcano and a rift opened on the north-east flank. No eruptive activity occurred but a quantity of material, possibly liquid, was emplaced into the edifice and is estimated to have a volume of ~1011 m3. Such activity can indicate that magma is rising into the edifice, but is not always a precursor to an eruption.

Teide additionally is considered structurally unstable and its northern flank has a distinctive bulge. The summit of the volcano has a number of small active fumaroles emitting sulfur dioxide and other gases, including low levels of hydrogen sulfide.

A scientific assessment in 2006, published in the journal Eos, observed that &quot;in the past 30,000 years, eruptions have occurred at a rate of only four to six per millennium, with a predominance (70%) of very low hazard, basaltic eruptions&quot;. The authors further commented that &quot;the recent eruptive record, combined with the available petrological and radiometric data, provides a rather optimistic outlook on major volcanic hazards related to Teide and its rift zones, posing only very localized threats to the one million inhabitants of Tenerife and the 4.5 million annual visitors to Teide National Park.&quot; However, another study in 2009 concluded that Teide will probably erupt violently in the future, and that its structure is similar to that of Vesuvius and Etna. Thus the magnitude of the risk posed by Teide to the public remains a source of debate.

== Major climbs ==
In a publication of 1626, Sir Edmund Scory, who probably stayed on the island in the first decades of the 17th century, gives a description of Teide, in which he notes the suitable paths to the top and the effects its considerable height causes for travellers, indicating that the volcano had been accessed via different routes before the 17th century. In 1715 the English traveler J. Edens and his party made the ascent and reported their observations in the journal of the Royal Society in London.

After the Enlightenment, most of the expeditions that went to East Africa and the Pacific had Teide as one of the most rewarding targets. The expedition of Lord George Macartney, George Staunton and John Barrow in 1792 almost ended in tragedy, as a major snowstorm and rain swept over them and they failed to reach the peak of Teide, just barely getting past Montaña Blanca.

The German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt stopped in Tenerife during his voyage to South America in June 1799 and climbed Teide with his travelling companion Aimé Bonpland and some local guides. This excursion confirmed the volcanic origin of basalt.

During an expedition to Kilimanjaro, the German adventurer Hans Heinrich Joseph Meyer visited Teide in 1894 to observe ice conditions on the volcano. He described the two mountains as &quot;two kings, one rising in the ocean and the other in the desert and steppes&quot;.

More recently in November 2017, Gema Hassen-Bey became the first Paralympic athlete in the world in a wheelchair to reach 3,000 meters altitude with only the momentum of her arms. Initially, Gema wanted to reach the top of Teide, although, due to weather conditions, she could not meet this objective.

== Flora and fauna ==
The lava flows on the flanks of Teide weather to a very thin but nutrient- and mineral-rich soil that supports a wide variety of plant species. Vascular flora consists of 168 plant species, 33 of which are endemic to Tenerife.

Forests of Canary Island Pine (&quot;Pinus canariensis&quot;) with Canary Island juniper (&quot;Juniperus cedrus&quot;) occur from , covering the middle slopes of the volcano and reaching an alpine tree line lower than that of continental mountains at similar latitudes. Within the Las Cañadas caldera and at higher altitudes, plant species endemic to the Teide National Park include: the Teide white broom (&quot;Cytisus supranubius&quot;), which has white flowers; &quot;Descurainia bourgaeana&quot;, a shrubby crucifer with yellow flowers; the Canary Island wallflower (&quot;Erysimum scoparium&quot;), which has violet flowers; and the Teide bugloss (&quot;Echium wildpretii&quot;), whose red flowers form a pyramid up to in height. The Teide daisy (&quot;Argyranthemum teneriffae&quot;) can be found at altitudes close to above sea level, and the Teide violet (&quot;Viola cheiranthifolia&quot;) can be found right up to the summit, making it the highest flowering plant in Spain.

These plants are adapted to the tough environmental conditions on the volcano, such as high altitude, intense sunlight, extreme temperature variations, and lack of moisture. Adaptations include hemispherical forms, a downy or waxy cover, a reduction of the exposed leaf area, and high flower production. Flowering takes place in the late spring or early summer, in May and June.

Teide National Park contains a large number of invertebrate species, over 40% of which are endemic species, and 70 of which are found only in the National Park. The invertebrate fauna includes spiders, beetles, dipterans, hemipterans, and hymenopterae.

In contrast, Teide National Park has only a limited variety of vertebrate fauna. Ten species of bird nest there, including the blue chaffinch (&quot;Fringilla teydea&quot;), Berthelot&#x27;s pipit (&quot;Anthus berthelotii berthelotii&quot;), the Atlantic canary (&quot;Serinus canaria&quot;) and a subspecies of kestrel (&quot;Falco tinnunculus canariensis&quot;).

Three endemic reptile species are found in the park: the Canary Island lizard (&quot;Gallotia galloti galloti&quot;), the Canary Island wall gecko (&quot;Tarentola delalandii&quot;), and the Canary Island skink (&quot;Chalcides viridanus viridanus&quot;).

The only mammals native to the park are bats, the most common of which is Leisler&#x27;s bat (&quot;Nyctalus leisleri&quot;). Other mammals, such as the mouflon, the rabbit, the house mouse, the black rat, the feral cat, and the North African hedgehog, have all been introduced to the park.

== Shadow ==

Teide casts the world&#x27;s largest shadow projected on the sea. The shadow is cast for more than from the mountain&#x27;s summit, reaching as far as the island of La Gomera at dawn, and the island of Gran Canaria at sunset. The shadow has a perfectly triangular shape, even though Teide&#x27;s silhouette does not; this is an effect of aerial perspective. Visitors and tourists climb to the top of the volcano at sunset to witness this phenomenon.

== Scientific use ==
Teide National Park is a useful volcanic reference point for studies related to Mars because of the similarities in their environmental conditions and geological formations. In 2010 a research team tested the Raman instrument at Las Cañadas del Teide in anticipation of its use in the 2016–2018 ESA-NASA ExoMars expedition. In June 2011 a team of researchers from the UK visited the park to test a method for looking for life on Mars and to search for suitable places to test new robotic vehicles in 2012.

== Access ==

The volcano and its surroundings, including the whole of the Las Cañadas caldera, are protected in the Teide National Park. Access is by a public road running from northeast to southwest across the caldera. TITSA runs a return service to Teide once a day from both Puerto de la Cruz and Playa de las Americas. The park has a Parador (hotel) and a small chapel. A cable car goes from the roadside at most of the way to the summit, reaching , carrying up to 38 passengers (34 in a high wind) and taking eight minutes to reach the summit. Access to the summit itself is restricted; a free permit is required to climb the last . Numbers are normally restricted to 200 per day. Several footpaths take hikers to the upper cable car terminal, and then onto the summit.

Because of the altitude, the air is significantly thinner than at sea level. This can cause people (especially with heart or lung conditions) to become light-headed or dizzy, to develop altitude sickness, and in extreme cases to lose consciousness. The only treatment is to return to lower altitudes and acclimatise.

== Astronomical observatory ==
An astronomical observatory is located on the slopes of the mountain, taking advantage of the good weather, and the altitude, which puts it above most clouds, and promotes stable Astronomical seeing. The Teide Observatory is operated by the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias. It includes solar, radio and microwave telescopes, in addition to traditional optical night-time telescopes.

== Symbol ==
Teide is the main symbol of Tenerife and the most emblematic natural monument of the Canary Islands. An image of Teide, gushing flames, appears at the centre of Tenerife&#x27;s coat of arms. Above the volcano appears St. Michael, the patron saint of Tenerife. The flag colors of the island are dark blue, traditionally identified with the sea that surrounds the island, and white for the whiteness of the snow-covered peaks of Teide during winter. The logo of the Cabildo de Tenerife (governing body of the island) includes a symbol of Teide in eruption.

Teide has been depicted frequently throughout history, from the earliest engravings made by European conquerors to typical Canarian craft objects, on the back of the 1000-peseta banknote, in oil paintings and on postcards.

In the Canary Islands, especially on Tenerife, Teide has cultural symbolism deeply rooted in traditions and history. It is popularly referred to as &quot;Padre Teide&quot; (Father Teide).

== Lunar mountain ==
Mons Pico, one of the Montes Teneriffe range of lunar mountains in the inner ring of the Mare Imbrium, was named by Johann Hieronymus Schröter after the &quot;Pico von Teneriffe&quot;, an 18th-century German name for Teide.

There is also a brown dwarf star located in the open star cluster of the Pleiades called Teide 1.

<text>The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy consists of two vessels. The lead ship of her class, , was named on 4 July 2014 in honour of Elizabeth I and was commissioned on 7 December 2017. Her sister ship, , was launched on 21 December 2017, and was commissioned on 10 December 2019. They form the central components of the UK Carrier Strike Group.

The contract for the vessels was announced in July 2007, ending several years of delay over cost issues and British naval shipbuilding restructuring. The contracts were signed one year later on 3 July 2008, with the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, a partnership formed with Babcock International, Thales Group, A&amp;P Group, the UK Ministry of Defence and BAE Systems. In 2014 the UK Government announced that the second carrier would be brought into service, ending years of uncertainty surrounding its future. This was confirmed by the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015, with at least one carrier being available at any time.

The vessels have a full load displacement of an estimated , are long and are the largest warships ever constructed for the Royal Navy. The Carrier Air Wing (CVW) will vary depending on the type and location of deployment, but will consist of 12-24 F-35Bs under in peacetime and 36 in a conflict scenario (with up to 48 in extreme cases) and Merlin helicopters to conduct Anti-Submarine Warfare, Airborne Early Warning and utility roles. The projected cost of the programme is £6.2 billion.

The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review announced the intention to purchase the Lockheed Martin F-35C &quot;carrier variant&quot; and to build &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; in a Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration. However, in 2012, after projected costs of the CATOBAR system rose to around twice the original estimate, the government announced that it would revert to the original design deploying F-35Bs from Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) configured carriers.

==Background==
In May 1997, the newly elected Labour government led by Tony Blair launched the Strategic Defence Review, which re-evaluated every weapon system, then active or in procurement, with the exception of the Eurofighter Typhoon and the ballistic missile submarines. The report, published in July 1998, stated that aircraft carriers offer:
* The ability to operate offensive aircraft overseas, when foreign bases may not be available early in a conflict
* All required space and infrastructure, as even where foreign bases are available infrastructure is often lacking
* A coercive and deterrent effect when deployed to a trouble spot

The report concluded: &quot;the emphasis is now on increased offensive airpower, and an ability to operate the largest possible range of aircraft in the widest possible range of roles. When the current carrier force reaches the end of its planned life, we plan to replace it with two larger vessels. Work will now begin to refine our requirements but present thinking suggests that they might be of the order of 30,000–40,000 tonnes and capable of deploying up to 50 aircraft, including helicopters.&quot;

===Design studies===
Initial Ministry of Defence (MoD) design studies for what was then the &quot;Invincible&quot; class replacement were conducted in the mid-1990s. Options considered at this early stage included the possibilities of lengthening the hulls and extending the life of the existing &quot;Invincible&quot; class ships, converting commercial ships to carriers, and the construction of purpose-built new aircraft carriers.

On 25 January 1999, six companies were invited to tender for the assessment phase of the project – Boeing, British Aerospace (BAe), Lockheed Martin, Marconi Electronic Systems, Raytheon and Thomson-CSF. On 23 November 1999, the MoD awarded detailed assessment studies to two consortia, one led by BAe (renamed BAE Systems on 30 November 1999) and one led by Thomson-CSF (renamed Thales Group in 2000). The brief required up to six designs from each consortium with air-groups of thirty to forty Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA). The contracts were split into phases; the first £5.9 million phase was for design assessment which would form part of the aircraft selection, while the second £23.5 million phase involved &quot;risk reduction on the preferred carrier design option&quot;.

In 2005 BMT announced it had tested 4 different CVF hull form models and assessed them for propulsion efficiency, maneuverability, seakeeping and noise signatures. It also investigated skeg length, rudder size, transom stern flaps and bulbous bow designs. The basic Delta concept went through many further iterations and development before the design was considered sufficiently mature by late 2006 for detailed cost estimates to be drawn up prior to ordering long-lead items.

===Capability requirements and ship size===

The vessels, described as &quot;supercarriers&quot; by the media, legislators and sometimes by the Royal Navy, have a full load displacement of an estimated each, over three times the displacement of its predecessor, the . They are the largest warships ever built in the United Kingdom. The last large carriers proposed for the Royal Navy, the CVA-01 programme, were cancelled by the Labour government in the 1966 Defence White Paper. In November 2004 First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Alan West explained that the sortie rate and interoperability with the United States Navy were factors in deciding on the size of the carriers and the composition of the carriers&#x27; air-wings:

===Aircraft and carrier format selection===
On 17 January 2001, the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United States Department of Defense (DoD) for full participation in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme, confirming the JSF as the FJCA. This gave the UK input into aircraft design and the choice between the Lockheed Martin X-35 and Boeing X-32. On 26 October 2001, the DoD announced that Lockheed Martin had won the JSF contract.

On 30 September 2002, the MoD announced that the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force would operate the STOVL F-35B variant and that the carriers would take the form of large, conventional carriers, initially adapted for STOVL operations. The carriers, expected to remain in service for fifty years, were designed for but not with catapults and arrestor wires. The carriers were thus planned to be &quot;future proof&quot;, allowing them to operate a generation of CATOBAR aircraft beyond the F-35. The contract specified that any conversion would use US C-13 steam catapults and Mark 7 Arresting gear as used by the American carriers. Four months later on 30 January 2003, the Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, announced that the Thales Group design had won the competition but that BAE Systems would operate as prime contractor.

The Secretary of State for Defence announced the intention to proceed with the procurement of the carriers in July 2007. The contracts were officially signed one year later on 3 July 2008, after the creation of BVT Surface Fleet through the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Group&#x27;s VT Shipbuilding which was a requirement of the UK Government.

===Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010===

On 19 October 2010, the government announced the results of its Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). The review stated that only one carrier was certain to be commissioned; the fate of the other was left undecided. The second ship of the class could be placed in &quot;extended readiness&quot; to provide a continuous single carrier strike capability when the other was in refit or provide the option to regenerate more quickly to a two carrier strike ability. Alternatively, the second ship could be sold in &quot;cooperation with a close ally to provide continuous carrier-strike capability&quot;.

It was also announced that the operational carrier would have catapult and arrestor gear (CATOBAR) installed to accommodate the carrier variant of the F-35 rather than the short-take off and vertical-landing version. It was decided to use the next-generation Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) catapult and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) instead of the more conventional systems which the design had originally been specified to be compatible with.

The decision to convert &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to CATOBAR was reviewed after the projected costs rose to around double the original estimate. On 10 May 2012, the Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, announced in Parliament that the government had decided to revert to its predecessor&#x27;s plans to purchase the F-35B rather than the F-35C, and to complete both aircraft carriers with ski-jumps in the STOVL configuration. MoD sources indicated that the cost of installing EMALS and AAG on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; would have risen to £2 billion, of which about £450 million of which was the cost of the equipment and the remainder the cost of installation. The total cost of the work that had been done on the conversion to a CATOBAR configuration, and of reverting the design to the original STOVL configuration, was estimated by Philip Hammond to be &quot;something in the order of £100 million&quot;. In later testimony before a parliamentary committee, Bernard Gray, Chief of Defence Materiel, revealed that even though the carriers had been sold as adaptable and easy to convert for CATOBAR, no serious effort had been made in this direction since 2002.

===Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015===

On 23 November 2015, the government published its 2015 SDSR which confirmed its plans to bring into service both &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers, with one to be available at all times. The review also confirmed that one of the carriers would have enhanced amphibious capabilities. The government also reaffirmed its commitment to ordering 138 F-35 Lightning IIs, although the specific variant(s) was not mentioned. The review stated that 24 of these aircraft would be available to the aircraft carriers by 2023.

=== Future Maritime Aviation Force ===
On 24 May 2023 during the &#x27;Combined Naval Event 2023&#x27; conference in Farnborough &#x27;Project Ark Royal&#x27; was announced. This project would &quot;explore the widespread fielding of uncrewed aviation across the surface fleet, with a specific focus on future carrier aviation&quot; The purpose of the project was to enable the operation of high-performance unmanned strike and support systems and potentially fixed-wing aircraft through the phased introduction of aircraft launch and recovery equipment for those types of aircraft. This phased implementation was described by Colonel Phil Kelly, Head of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Carrier Strike and Maritime Aviation as &quot;moving from STOVL (short take off vertical landing) to STOL (short takeoff and landing), then to STOBAR (Short takeoff but arrested recovery) and then to CATOBAR (catapult assisted takeoff but arrested recovery)&quot;. These changes would necessitate the eventual installation of catapults, arrestor gear and an angled flight deck as previously envisioned in the 2010 Strategic Defense and Security Review with the carriers having been built for but not with this capability.

== General characteristics ==
The ships&#x27; company is 679, rising to 1,600 when the air crew is added. In April 2015 a parliamentary reply stated that the average crew size would be 672. The ships have an empty load displacement of 65,000 tonnes on delivery, with an estimated full load displacement of 80,600 tonnes as the ships are upgraded through their lifetime. They have an overall length of , a width of , a height of , a draught of , and a range of . Nuclear propulsion was rejected due to its high cost and manpower required in favour of Integrated Electric Propulsion consisting of two Rolls-Royce Marine Trent MT30 gas turbine generator units and four Wärtsilä diesel generator sets (two and two ). The Trents and diesels are the largest ever supplied to the Royal Navy, and together they feed the low-voltage electrical systems as well as four GE Power Conversion&#x27;s 20 MW electric propulsion motors that drive the twin fixed-pitch propellers.

Instead of a single island superstructure containing both the ships&#x27; navigation bridges and flying control (FLYCO) centres, the ships have these operations divided between two structures, with the forward island for navigation and the aft island for controlling flying operations. The primary reason for having twin islands was to space out the funnels, as the ships were designed with redundancy with &quot;duplicated main and secondary machinery in two complexes with independent uptakes and downtakes in each of the two islands&quot;, while the alternative of consolidating all the exhaust trunkings would have reduced hangar space as well as increasing the vulnerability to flooding. Additional benefits include easier construction, reduced wind turbulence, and freed up deck space. Using two structures provides separate mountings for the air surveillance radar (forward), which does not interfere with the medium-range radar (aft); furthermore, visibility is improved for both navigation and landing operations.

Under the flight deck are a further nine decks. The hangar deck measures with a height of , large enough to accommodate up to twenty fixed and rotary wing aircraft. To transfer aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck, the ships have two large lifts, each of which is capable of lifting two F-35Bs or one CH-47 Chinook from the hangar to the flight deck in sixty seconds. The ships&#x27; only announced self-defence weapons are currently the Phalanx CIWS for airborne threats and Browning .50 caliber heavy machine guns. The planned 30 mm cannon to counter seaborne threats are currently fitted for but not with . 

===Systems===
The ship&#x27;s radars are the BAE Systems/Thales S1850M for long-range wide-area search, the BAE Systems Artisan 3D Type 997 maritime medium-range active electronically scanned array radar, and a navigation radar. BAE claims the S1850M has a fully automatic detection and track initiation that can track up to 1,000 air targets at a range of around . Artisan can &quot;track a target the size of a snooker ball over away&quot;, with a maximum range of 200 km. They will also be fitted with the Ultra Electronics Series 2500 Electro Optical System (EOS) and Glide Path Camera (GPC).

Munitions and ammunition handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This is the first naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along trackways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces the size of the crew by automation.

===Crew facilities===
Crew facilities include a cinema, five physical fitness areas (gyms), a chapel (with embarked naval chaplain), and four galleys manned by sixty-seven catering staff. There are four large dining areas, the largest with the capacity to serve 960 meals in one hour. There are eleven medical staff for the eight-bed medical facility, which includes an operating theatre and a dental surgery. There are 1,600 bunks in 470 cabins, including accommodation for a company of 250 Royal Marines with wide access routes up to the flight deck.

==Carrier air group==
Only one carrier will have a Carrier Air Wing embarked at any one time. In peacetime, 12 - 24 F-35Bs will be embarked. This will rise to 36 F-35Bs during combat operations, with the ability to operate 48 in extreme circumstances. The ships have a sortie generation rate of up to 110 per day. Fourteen Merlin HM2 will be available with typically nine in anti-submarine configuration and four or five with Crowsnest for airborne early warning; alternatively a &quot;littoral manoeuvre&quot; package could include a mix of Royal Navy Commando Helicopter Force Merlin HC4, Wildcat AH1, RAF Chinook transports, and Army Air Corps Apache attack helicopters. six landing spots are planned, but the deck could be marked out for the operation of ten medium helicopters at once, allowing the lift of a company of 250 troops. The hangars are designed for operating Chinooks without blade folding and the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor; the two aircraft lifts can each accommodate a Chinook with unfolded blades.

The use of UAVs and UCAVs is currently being explored by the Royal Navy. In November 2023, the General Atomics Mojave UAV successfully launched and recovered from HMS Prince of Wales, the first time a fixed wing RPAS had done so. 

===Fixed-wing aircraft===
Although the size of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class would enable it to accommodate most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as F-35B Lightning, tiltrotors such as the Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.

====F-35 Lightning II====
With the retirement of the Harrier GR7 and GR9 in 2010, there remained no carrier-capable fixed-wing aircraft available to the Royal Navy or Royal Air Force. Their replacement is the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

After the 2010 SDSR Review the government intended to purchase the F-35C carrier variant and modify one carrier to use the CATOBAR system to launch and recover these aircraft. This was because the cheaper F-35C variant has a greater range and can carry a larger and more diverse payload than the F-35B. On 10 May 2012 the Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced in Parliament that the government had decided to revert to its predecessor&#x27;s plans to purchase the F-35B rather than the F-35C, and to abandon the completion of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; in a CATOBAR configuration. The reason given was that &quot;conversion to &#x27;cats and traps&#x27; will cost about double what was originally estimated – and would not be delivered until 2023 at the earliest&quot;. Although the F-35B is fully capable of performing vertical landing, in a similar fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning&#x27;s vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic &#x27;thermal paint&#x27; is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500 °C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.

On 19 July 2012, Hammond indicated in a speech in the United States that the UK would order an initial 48 F-35B aircraft to be operated jointly by the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm. In November 2015, the government announced its commitment to an order of 138 F-35 aircraft, with 24 available for carrier duties by 2023. The 2021 defence white paper sharply reduced the envisaged total number of aircraft to be purchased to &quot;beyond 48&quot;. Subsequently, the First Sea Lord indicated that the new envisaged number was to be 60 aircraft initially and &quot;then maybe more&quot;, up to a maximum of around 80 to hopefully equip four &quot;deployable squadrons&quot;. In April 2022, the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Richard Knighton, told the House of Commons Defence Select Committee that the MoD was in discussions to purchase a second tranche of 26 F-35B fighters. Subsequent reports suggested that this second tranche order would only be completed in 2033.

Plans for frontline F-35B squadrons had been modified and now envisaged a total of three squadrons (rather than four) each deploying 12 to 16 aircraft. In surge conditions 24 F-35s might be deployed on a carrier but a routine deployment would likely involve 12 aircraft.

In December 2016, the British Government announced that it reached an agreement with the United States to allow the deployment of USMC F-35s from &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; upon the ship&#x27;s entry into service, with a reciprocal arrangement seeing RAF and FAA aircraft operating from ships of the US Navy.

Currently, UK F-35B&#x27;s are set to be integrated with a number of UK weapon systems. MBDA&#x27;s Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) and long range Meteor missiles will be used for air-to-air engagements. Up-to two ASRAAMs can be carried on the outermost external weapon stations, whilst up-to four Meteors can be carried internally when in a stealth configuration, with mock-ups showing an additional four meteors can be mounted externally in a &#x27;Beast Mode&#x27; configuration. For air-to-surface missions, an F-35B can carry up-to six Raytheon UK Paveway IV 500lb guided bombs with two bombs mounted internally, or eight 140+ km ranged SPEAR 3 cruise missiles (it is not yet known if SPEAR can/will be externally mounted on the F-35B). It has not be confirmed if the F-35B will be integrated with the upcoming French-British-Italian Future Cruise / Anti-Ship Weapon(s).

===Helicopters===

====Wildcat====
The AgustaWestland AW159 is a medium-sized, twin-engine, multi-role helicopter and a development of the Westland Lynx. Known as the &#x27;Wildcat&#x27;, it is in service with both the British Army as the Wildcat MK1 and the Royal Navy as the Wildcat HMA2 (or HMA Mk2). The Royal Navy&#x27;s first Wildcat HMA2 entered service on 23 March 2015. The HM2 maritime variant is optimised for surface warfare and can be armed with up-to 20x Martlet multi-role missiles or up-to 4x Sea Venom anti-ship missiles or machine guns; alternatively, Sting Ray lightweight torpedoes and depth charges may be carried for anti-submarine duties. These weapons are supported by an array of sensors such as the Seaspray 7400E AESA radar, MX-15Di electro-optical/FLIR camera and various radar and missile warning systems. The aircraft has a maximum range of and an endurance of four and a half hours.

The nature of the Wildcat&#x27;s role is more likely to see it deployed onboard a carrier&#x27;s escort vessels rather than a carrier itself.

====Merlin====

The AgustaWestland AW101 is a family of medium-sized, three-engined, multi-role helicopters. Two versions are in service with the UK Armed Forces, where it is known as the &#x27;Merlin&#x27;. The Merlin Mk4 or &#x27;Commando Merlin&#x27; is designed to carry up to twenty-four troops seated or sixteen stretcher patients and focuses on conducting utility missions such as troop insertions, whilst the Merlin Mk2 or HM2 anti-submarine warfare variant is fitted with a dipping sonar and sonar-buoy dispensers, and a complete electronic warfare suite; additionally it can be mounted with the Crowsnest airborne surveillance and control kit.

Both versions use a common airframe. Their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option is , or six hours. However, range can be extended further when the five underfloor fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks fitted in the cabin. Armament depends on the mission but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. Currently, Royal Navy&#x27;s Merlin Mk2 fleet is only integrated with Sting Ray lightweight torpedoes and depth charges, and both the Mk2 and Mk4 can be equipped with machine guns. It was initially anticipated that at least 14 Merlin HM2s would be assigned to the carrier. However, in practice with just 30 Merlin HM2s in service, it may be impossible to deploy 14 aircraft on a single operational carrier on a full-time basis. During the 2021 carrier strike group deployment to the Pacific, for instance, considerably fewer than 14 Merlins were embarked with the task group, while during the 2023 &quot;Operation FIREDRAKE&quot; deployment, only five Merlins (along with three Wildcats and eight F-35Bs) were embarked on the carrier.

===Airborne early warning and control===
The 1982 Falklands War made clear the importance of airborne early warning and control and led to the development of the Sea King AEW2, which was succeeded by the Sea King ASaC7. This was scheduled to be retired in the second half of 2018 and planning for its replacement was identified at an early stage as an integral part of the next-generation aircraft carrier. The programme became known as the &quot;Future Organic Airborne Early Warning&quot; (FOAEW), and contracts were placed with BAE / Northrop Grumman and Thales in April 2001. In April 2002, BAE and Northrop Grumman received a follow-on study contract for Phase II of the project, by then renamed Maritime Airborne Surveillance and Control (MASC). The MASC assessment phase began in September 2005 and by May 2006 three study contracts were awarded for MASC platform and mission systems options: one to Lockheed Martin UK for a Merlin helicopter fitted with AEW mission systems, another to AgustaWestland to maintain the present Sea King ASaC7 and finally to Thales UK to upgrade the Sea King&#x27;s mission systems.

The 2010 SDSR delayed the project which became a competition between Thales and Lockheed to supply Crowsnest, a bolt-on sensor package that can be carried by any Merlin HM2. The Thales pod is based on the Sea King&#x27;s Searchwater 2000; Lockheed had intended to use a derivative of the F-35&#x27;s APG-81 radar but is now believed to be using an Elta system. Both systems were scheduled to begin flight trials in the summer of 2014 ahead of Main Gate in 2016. Ten pods were planned with IOC in 2019, but that was later changed to late-2021, and then (subsequently) to the second quarter of 2023. A small force of Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters had been kept in service with 849 Naval Air Squadron after the final withdrawal of the remainder of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Kings, but these aircraft were withdrawn from service in September 2018. As part of the process of the system reaching initial operating capability, Crowsnest was deployed on the first Merlin helicopters in March 2021. However, the system experienced operating challenges. Initial operating capability of the system was achieved in July 2023 and full operating capability is expected in 2024/25. It has been reported that initially five Merlins will be equipped with Crowsnest, three of these being normally assigned to the &quot;high readiness&quot; aircraft carrier. During its 2023 &quot;Operation FIREDRAKE&quot; deployment, two of five Merlins embarked on &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; were in the AEW configuration.

===Other aircraft===
In March 2021, it emerged that the Royal Navy was considering fitting its &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers with electromagnetic catapults and arrestor cables to launch and recover non-STOVL aircraft. An MOD-issued Request for Information (RFI) specified a need for a system capable of launching a maximum weight of and recovering a maximum weight of for installation within threefive years. Whilst these weight limits mean it is unable to launch and recover large conventional aircraft, like the F-35C, the system will be able to launch and recover unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). During the same month, it emerged that the Royal Navy was undertaking conceptual work on a carrier-borne UAV under Project Vixen. The Royal Navy plans to operate these UAVs in strike, electronic warfare, air-to-air refueling and airborne early warning roles, replacing some helicopter-based platforms, including Merlin Crowsnest. In May 2023, the UK announced a contract to trial a General Atomics Mojave short-take off and landing UAV aboard &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. These trials took place in November 2023 off the coast of the United States and saw the aircraft successfully launched and recovered. In September 2023, an Autonomous Systems W drone was also trialed for carrier onboard delivery.

==Construction==

During a speech on 21 July 2004, Geoff Hoon announced a one-year delay to allow contractual and cost issues to be resolved. The building of the carriers was confirmed in December 2005. The building was undertaken by four companies across seven shipyards, with final block integration and assembly at Rosyth:
* BAE Systems Surface Ships – Govan (Lower Blocks 3 and 4), Scotstoun (aft island) and Portsmouth (Lower Blocks 2, 5 and forward island)
* Babcock Marine – Rosyth (Sponsons, Mast and Centre Blocks 5 and 6) and Appledore (Lower Block 1)
* A&amp;P Group – Hebburn (Centre Block 3)
* Cammell Laird – Birkenhead (Centre Blocks 2 and 4)

In December 2007, eight diesel engines and electricity generators, four for each ship, were ordered from Wärtsilä. On 4 March 2008, contracts for the supply of 80,000 tonnes of steel were awarded to Corus Group, with an estimated value of £65 million. Other contracts included £3 million for fibre optic cable, over £1 million for reverse osmosis equipment to provide over 500 tonnes of fresh water daily, and £4 million for aviation fuel systems. On 3 April 2008, a contract for the manufacture of aircraft lifts (worth £13m) was awarded to MacTaggart Scott of Loanhead, Scotland.

In mid May 2008, the Treasury announced that it would be making available further funds on top of the regular defence budget, reportedly allowing the construction of the carriers to begin. This was followed, on 20 May 2008, by the government giving the &quot;green light&quot; for construction of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class, stating that it was ready to sign the contracts for full production once the creation of the planned shipbuilding joint venture between BAE Systems and the VT Group had taken place. This joint venture, BVT Surface Fleet, became operational on 1 July 2008. VT Group later sold its share to BAE Systems which renamed the unit BAE Systems Surface Ships. It undertook approximately forty per cent of the project workload.

On 1 September 2008, the MoD announced a £51 million package of important equipment contracts; £34 million for the highly mechanised weapons handling system for the two ships, £8 million for supply of uptake and down-take systems for both ships, £5 million for air traffic control software, £3 million for supply of pumps and associated systems engineering, and £1 million for emergency diesel generators. On 6 October 2008, it was announced that contracts had been placed for &quot;the carriers&#x27; Rolls-Royce gas turbines, generators, motors, power distribution equipment, platform management systems, propellers, shafts, steering gear, rudders and stabilisers&quot;.

The construction of the two carriers involves more than 10,000 people from 90 companies, 7,000 of them in the six shipyards building the sections of the ships.

===Ships===
====&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;====
The first steel cut for the project, in July 2009, signalled the start of construction of Lower Block 3 at BAE Systems Clyde, where production of Lower Block 4 started in January 2010. Meanwhile, construction of the bow Lower Block 1 was carried out at Appledore, North Devon, and was completed in March 2010.

On 25 January 2010, it was announced that the Cammell Laird shipyard has secured a £44 million contract to build the flight decks of the carriers. That same day, construction began in Portsmouth of the 6,000-tonne Lower Block 2 for &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. On 16 August 2011, the 8,000-tonne Lower Block 03 of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; left BAE Systems Surface Ships&#x27; Govan shipyard in Glasgow on a large ocean-going barge. Travelling around the northern coast of Scotland, the block arrived at Rosyth on the evening of 20 August 2011. Her forward island was built at BAE Portsmouth and attached on 14 March 2013; the aft island was attached in June 2013 and the ski jump in November 2013.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was christened on 4 July 2014, and floated-out on 17 July 2014. On 26 June 2017, the new carrier left Rosyth for the first time to commence sea trials. Flight trials with helicopters began in July 2017 and F-35B flight trials were expected towards the end of 2018. Initial operational capability was declared on 4 January 2021.

====&quot;Prince of Wales&quot;====
The 2010 SDSR declared that the UK needed only one aircraft carrier; however, penalty clauses in the contract meant that cancelling the second vessel would be more expensive than actually building it. The SDSR, therefore, directed that the second aircraft carrier, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, should be built but upon completion be either mothballed or sold. The SDSR also directed that the ship be converted to a CATOBAR configuration; however, the costs associated with the conversion escalated to £2bn, leading the government to reverse its decision and build the ship to the original STOVL configuration. On 26 May 2011, Defence Secretary Liam Fox cut the first steel for &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The Royal Navy&#x27;s 2012/13 yearbook stated &quot;both carriers are likely to be commissioned and may even be capable of operating together&quot;. In 2014, the prime minister, David Cameron, announced that &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; would be brought into service.

As of 20 April 2016, construction of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was announced to be 80% complete. The ship was handed over to the Royal Navy on 10 December 2019 and had been set for a full operational capability from 2023.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; assumed responsibility for the continuing carrier trials of the F-35B in 2019 when &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; entered dry-dock for her scheduled maintenance period.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; made her first visit to her affiliated city, Liverpool, from 28 February to 3 March 2020. During her stay in the city, the ship welcomed thousands of civilians aboard.

In August 2022, the external shaft coupling on the starboard propeller shaft, of HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, failed, not long after setting sail from Portsmouth Naval Base. The vessel was towed back to base. It was then taken to Babcock shipyard, in Rosyth, Scotland, to undergo repairs, which took nine months to complete.

==Costs==
When the Secretary of State for Defence announced the contract for the vessels, the cost was initially estimated at £3.9 billion. At the time of approval the first carrier was expected to enter service in July 2015 and the budget was £4.1bn for two ships. The financial crisis led to a decision in December 2008 to slow production, delaying the first ship until May 2016 and the second by two years. This decision alone added £1.6bn to the cost. By March 2010 the budget was estimated at £5.9bn. If the carriers had been abandoned in the 2010 SDSR then the MoD could have cancelled £1.5bn of planned spending on &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and £1.3bn of planned spending on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, but the loss of VAT exemption meant that cancelling one or two carriers would have overall saved £989m and £2,098m respectively. These long term savings were less important than the short term costs, there would have been nearly an extra £1bn of expenditure on cancellation costs. In November 2013 the contract was renegotiated with a budget of £6.2bn and BAE agreeing to pay 50% of any cost overruns rather than 10% as previously.

In 2018 the Committee of Public Accounts determined that build cost of the two carriers was £6.212 billion, and operational costs up to March 2021 were estimated at £0.6 billion. Costs for the aircraft were estimated up to March 2021 to be £5.8 billion on initial F-35s and £0.3 billion on the Crowsnest radar system for Merlin helicopters (based on an exchange rate of $1.55 to the pound in October 2017, but the rate has since fallen considerably). Important additional equipment such as communication equipment and related software for the F-35 was not yet funded. The whole life cost of the first 48 F-35s was roughly estimated as £13 billion, or over £270 million per F-35.

<text>George Verwer (July 3, 1938 – April 14, 2023) was an American evangelist and founder of Operation Mobilisation (OM), an evangelical Christian missions organization. Verwer wrote several books on various Christian themes. He was a passionate advocate of radical discipleship as the only legitimate option for people who believe in Jesus. Over a million books he authored have been distributed worldwide.

==Early life==
George Verwer was born on July 3, 1938 to George Verwer, Sr. and Eleanor Caddell Verwer. His parents were Dutch immigrants and he was raised in Wyckoff, New Jersey, where his father worked as an electrician. Verwer&#x27;s family attended a Reformed Church of America congregation, although his father rarely attended church and Verwer attended church to socialize. As a child, Verwer had a reputation for mischief, most notably setting creating a fire in Bergen County forest and getting caught by the police breaking into a neighbor&#x27;s home.

As a result of these incidents, Dorothea Clapp gave him the Gospel of John and prayed that he would convert to Christianity. Verwer later said that Clapp put him on her &quot;Holy Ghost hit list&quot;. Verwer attributed to her some of the reasons that he made a commitment to Christ, and for what resulted in his life. In 1953, as a 14-year-old student from Wyckoff, New Jersey, attending Ramsey High School, Verwer went to a Jack Wyrtzen meeting in which Billy Graham spoke in Madison Square Garden, in New York City. There he was converted to become a Christian, at the age of 16. Within a year, about 200 of his classmates became Christians.

Verwer had a growing conviction to evangelize on foreign soil. He started with the distribution of the Gospel of John in Mexico in 1957 along with two friends, Walter Borchard and Dale Rhoton. They called this operation &quot;Send the Light&quot;. This continued with others during the summer holidays. Afterward, Verwer used the name &quot;Send the Light&quot; for a book distribution operation to India based in the United Kingdom. This developed into Send the Light, which was once the largest Christian book distributor in the United Kingdom, but entered into administration December 2009 and moved into liquidation December 2010.

==Education==
After high school, he attended Maryville College and then transferred to Moody Bible Institute, where he met his wife, Drena, a fellow student. They have three children.

Verwer was awarded an honorary degree, Doctor of Divinity, during commencement at Biola University on May 22, 2009.

==Operation Mobilisation==
After graduation, they went to Spain. Once while taking Bibles into the USSR, George was arrested and accused of being a spy. He was deported, and back in Spain, after a time of prayer in 1961 the work of OM was born. George often referred to this calling himself &quot;God&#x27;s Bungler&quot;, in reference to Brother Andrew, &quot;God&#x27;s Smuggler&quot;.

In August 2003, George handed over the international leadership of the work of OM to Peter Maiden, who was the Associate International Director for 15 years. George and his wife were involved in Special Projects Ministries full-time, traveling and taking meetings around the world.

==Death==
Verwer died on April 14, 2023, at the age of 84.

<doc id="565250" wikidata="Q836968" url="?curid=565250" title="Paternoster lift">
<text>A paternoster (, , or ) or paternoster lift is a passenger elevator which consists of a chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two people) that move slowly in a up and down inside a building without stopping. Passengers can step on or off at any floor they like. The same technique is also used for filing cabinets to store large amounts of (paper) documents or for small spare parts. The much smaller belt manlift, which consists of an endless belt with steps and rungs but no compartments, is also sometimes called a paternoster.

The name &quot;paternoster&quot; (&quot;Our Father&quot;, the first two words of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Latin) was originally applied to the device because the elevator is in the form of a loop and is thus similar to rosary beads used as an aid in reciting prayers.

The construction of new paternosters was stopped in the mid-1970s out of concern for safety, but public sentiment has kept many of the remaining examples open. By far, most remaining paternosters are in Europe, with 230 examples in Germany and 68 in the Czech Republic. Only three have been identified outside Europe; one each in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Peru.

== History ==
British architect Peter Ellis obtained a patent in July 1866 for &quot;an improved lift, hoist, or mechanical elevator&quot; with two shafts and subsequently installed the first elevators that could be described as paternoster lifts in Oriel Chambers in Liverpool in 1868. This patent lapsed in July 1873. Another was used in 1876 to transport parcels at the General Post Office in London. In 1878, British engineer Frederick Hart obtained a patent on the paternoster. In 1884, the engineering firm of J &amp; E Hall of Dartford, Kent, installed its first &quot;Cyclic Elevator&quot;, using Hart&#x27;s patent, in a London office block, and the firm is generally considered the company first involved in regular construction of the lifts.

The newly built Dovenhof in Hamburg was inaugurated in 1886. The prototype of the Hamburg office buildings equipped with the latest technology also had a paternoster. This first system outside of Great Britain already had the technology that would later become common, but was still driven by steam power like the British systems.

The highest paternoster lift in the world was located in Stuttgart in the 16-floor Tagblatt tower, which was completed in 1927. This was replaced with conventional elevators in 1959.

Paternosters were popular throughout the first half of the 20th century because they could carry more passengers than ordinary elevators. They were more common in continental Europe, especially in public buildings, than in the United Kingdom. They are relatively slow elevators, typically travelling at about to facilitate passengers embarking and disembarking.

== Safety ==
Paternoster elevators are intended only for transporting people. Accidents have occurred when they have been misused for transporting large items such as ladders or library trolleys. Their overall rate of accidents is estimated as 30 times higher than conventional elevators. A representative of the Union of Technical Inspection Associations stated that Germany saw an average of one death per year due to paternosters prior to 2002, at which point many of them were made inaccessible to the general public.

Because the accident risk is much greater than for conventional elevators, the construction of new paternosters is no longer allowed in many countries. In 2012, an 81-year-old man was killed when he fell into the shaft of a paternoster in the Dutch city of The Hague. Elderly people, disabled people and children are most vulnerable.

In September 1975, the paternoster in Newcastle University&#x27;s Claremont Tower was temporarily taken out of service after a passenger was killed when a car left its guide rail at the top of its journey and forced the two cars ascending behind it into the winding room above. In October 1988 a second, non-fatal accident occurred in the same lift. A conventional lift replaced it in 1989–1990.

In West Germany, new paternoster installations were banned in 1974, and in 1994 there was an attempt to shut down all existing installations. However, there was a wave of popular resistance to the ban, and to a similar attempt in 2015, and as a result many are still in operation. , Germany had 231 paternosters.

<doc id="565255" wikidata="Q609498" url="?curid=565255" title="Vendor-managed inventory">
<text>Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is an inventory management practice in which a supplier of goods, usually the manufacturer, is responsible for optimizing the inventory held by a distributor.

Under VMI, the retailer shares their inventory data with a vendor (sometimes called supplier) such that the vendor is the decision-maker who determines the order size, whereas in traditional inventory management, the retailer (sometimes called distributor or buyer) makes his or her own decisions regarding the order size. Thus, the vendor is responsible for the retailer&#x27;s ordering cost, while the retailer usually acquires ownership of the stock and has to pay for their own holding cost. One supply chain management glossary identifies VMI as although a 2008 article notes that there is no standard definition of VMI and the term&#x27;s usage varies &quot;significantly&quot; among companies supporting VMI processes.

A third-party logistics provider may also be involved to help ensure that the buyer has the required level of inventory by adjusting the demand and supply gaps.

==Overview==
One of the keys to making VMI work is shared risk. In some cases, if the inventory does not sell, the vendor (supplier) will repurchase the product from the buyer (retailer). In other cases, the product may be in the possession of the retailer but is not owned by the retailer until the sale takes place, meaning that the retailer simply houses (and assists with the sale of) the product in exchange for a predetermined commission or profit (sometimes referred to as consignment stock). A special form of this commission business is scan-based trading, where VMI is usually applied but its use is not mandatory.

This is one of the successful business models used by Walmart, Procter &amp; Gamble and many other big box retailers. Oil companies often use technology to manage the gasoline inventories at the service stations that they supply (see Petrolsoft Corporation). Home Depot uses the technique with larger suppliers of manufactured goods. VMI helps foster a closer understanding between the supplier and manufacturer by using electronic data interchange formats, EDI software and statistical methodologies to forecast and maintain correct inventory in the supply chain.

Vendors benefit from more control of displays and more customer contact for their employees; retailers benefit from reduced risk, better store staff knowledge (which builds brand loyalty for both the vendor and the retailer), and reduced display maintenance outlays.

Usage of VMI can prevent stocking undesired inventories and hence can lead to an overall cost reduction. Moreover, the magnitude of the bullwhip effect is also reduced by employing the VMI approach in a buyer-supplier cooperation.

Consumers benefit from knowledgeable store staff who are in frequent and familiar contact with manufacturer (vendor) representatives when parts or service are required. Store staff have good knowledge of most product lines offered by the entire range of vendors. They can help the consumer choose from competing products for items most suited to them and offer service support being offered by the store.

At the goods manufacturing level, VMI helps prevent overflowing warehouses or shortages, as well as costly labor, purchasing and accounting. With VMI, businesses maintain a proper inventory, and optimized inventory leads to easy access and fast processing with reduced labor costs.

Variant models include &quot;consigned VMI&quot;, where the supplier or manufacturer retains ownership, and &quot;dynamic VMI&quot;, where the buffer inventory remains located with the supplier, which can be beneficial if the supplier and retailer are located close enough together, and allows for buffer stock to be shared among distributors.

As a symbiotic business relationship, VMI makes it less likely that a business will unintentionally run out of stock of a good and reduces inventory in the supply chain. Furthermore, vendor (supplier) representatives in a store benefit the vendor by ensuring the product is properly displayed and store staff are familiar with the features of the product line, all these while helping to clean and organize their product lines for the store. However, high-tech sector research undertaken in 2003 concluded that under VMI, &quot;sizeable inventory burdens [are transferred] from the customer to the supplier&quot; and that &quot;significant additional operating expenses for the supplier&quot; therefore arise.

== Components ==
1. Inventory location

In VMI practice, inventory location depends on the arrangement between the vendor and the customer. The first option is for the inventory to be located both at the customer&#x27;s and the supplier&#x27;s premises. For the supplier, this serves as a safeguard against short delivery cycles or unsynchronized production cycles. On the other hand, this arrangement can also lead to higher inventory holding costs because of the need for storage of the material, its tracking and handling, and the threat of inventory obsolescence.

Another option can be for the vendor to deliver to the customer&#x27;s central warehouse or alternatively, to a third party&#x27;s warehouse. The latter can be a solution for buyers that have outsourced part or all of their logistics operations. Managing the inventory at the central warehouse enables better optimization of deliveries, lower costs and ultimately enables the buyer to maximize economies of scale. However, it is not always an option, so third-party warehouses are often the solution to many different problems such as the supplier&#x27;s warehouse being too far away from the buyer&#x27;s or the buyer&#x27;s inexperience in storing particular types of goods that are harder to store.

The inventory can also be located directly at the buyer&#x27;s premises such as the buyer&#x27;s on-site warehouse, production line or the shop floor itself. However, replenishing inventory levels at these specific locations can be more costly, less organized and overall more difficult to manage for the supplier.

2. Inventory Ownership

Inventory ownership refers to the ownership of the inventory and when the invoice is being issued to the retailer. In vendor managed inventory, there is a number of solutions in terms of payment and transfer of ownership.

In the first alternative, the vendor is the owner of inventory at the premises of the customer. Invoice is issued when the items are issued from the stock. In the second alternative, the retailer assumes ownership of the inventory, but receives an invoice upon delivery. However, the vendor is not paid until the customer issues the items from stock and within a delay according to agreed terms of payment. This enables risk-sharing between both parties, as the retailer carries risk of obsolescence while the vendor would have been accountable for capital costs and fluctuation in prices of the inventory.

In the third alternative, also referred to as a standard process in traditional order delivery, the retailer owns the inventory upon delivery, while the vendor invoices the retailer once the shipment has been made. In this setting, retailer is responsible for inventory investment and holding costs, but has an option of protecting themselves against price fluctuations.

3. Level of Demand Visibility

These elements refer to the type of demand information shared by customers to assist the suppliers in controlling their inventory. Many types of demand information are shared in the VMI Program. The demand information that are visible to the supplier are: sales data, stock withdrawal, production schedule, inventory level, goods in transit, back order, incoming order and return. It is argued that sharing data and inventory can improve the supplier’s production planning, make it more stable and increase its visibility. It also provides a better understanding of the seasonal changes, and helps to figure out critical times. The supplier can therefore take advantage of this information and adapt its production to the customers’ requests, and respond faster. With the increasing visibility of information, the supplier has a longer timeframe for replenishment arrangement.
The supplier also gets real time visibility, which allows him to have a hand on the inventory for the buyer demand forecast, which allows for projecting inventory based on future demand to target his inventory (minimize or maximize it). This stability and coordination allows to reduce the bullwhip effect, as the manufacturer has a clearer visibility on the supply chain and an overview of the incoming demand. On the retailer’s side, all the costs associated with inventory management, (holding costs, shortage costs, spoilage costs, etc.) are greatly reduced. E.g., the retailer will rarely face stock shortage and holding costs are kept at a minimum since just enough inventory is held.

Data is usually updated every week and is transmitted through an EDI, which allows forecasting actual market trends. The data is based on real quantities of produced and sold items. This agreement to share information is aimed at maintaining a steady flow of necessary goods.

==Classes of mathematical model==

1. Bi-Level VMI Mathematical Models

The first class of VMI, bi-level VMI mathematical model, includes two levels (or echelons) in a supply chain: vendor and retailer. There are three types of VMI mathematical models developed from this class, which are single-vendor single-retailer VMI model, single-vendor multi-retailer VMI model, and multi-vendor multi-retailer VMI model. This class has been significantly developing. For example, single-vendor single-retailer VMI model was extended for multi-product case, the consignment stock (CS), and discount.

2. Multi-Level VMI Mathematical Models

The second class is a multi-level VMI mathematical model such as a single manufacturer-single vendor multi-retailer (SM-SV-MR) VMI model. Those studies [which] fail to model replenishment frequencies cannot be classified here.

Replenishment frequencies play an important role in integrated inventory models to reduce the total supply chain cost, but it has been noted that many studies fail to model it in mathematical problems.

<doc id="565258" wikidata="Q2299355" url="?curid=565258" title="Forty acres and a mule">
<text>Forty acres and a mule refers to a key part of Special Field Orders, No. 15 (series 1865), a wartime order proclaimed by Union general William Tecumseh Sherman on January 16, 1865, during the American Civil War, to allot land to some freed families, in plots of land no larger than . Sherman later ordered the army to lend mules for the agrarian reform effort. The field orders followed a series of conversations between Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Radical Republican abolitionists Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens following disruptions to the institution of slavery provoked by the American Civil War. They provided for the confiscation of of land along the Atlantic coast of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida and the dividing of it into parcels of not more than , on which were to be settled approximately 18,000 formerly enslaved families and other black people then living in the area.

Many freed people believed, after being told by various political figures, that they had a right to own the land they had been forced to work as slaves and were eager to control their own property. Freed people widely expected to legally claim 40 acres of land. However, Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s successor as president, Andrew Johnson, tried to reverse the intent of Sherman&#x27;s wartime Order No. 15 and similar provisions included in the second Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau bills.

Some land redistribution occurred under military jurisdiction during the war and for a brief period thereafter. However, federal and state policy during the Reconstruction era emphasized wage labor, not land ownership, for black people. Almost all land allocated during the war was restored to its pre-war white owners. Several black communities did maintain control of their land, and some families obtained new land by homesteading. Black land ownership increased markedly in Mississippi during the 19th century, particularly. The state had much undeveloped bottomland (low-lying alluvial land near a river) behind riverfront areas that had been cultivated before the war. Most black people acquired land through private transactions, with ownership peaking at or ~23,000 square miles in 1910, before an extended financial recession caused problems that resulted in the loss of property for many. 

==Background==

African Americans faced severe discrimination and were maintained as a distinct &quot;racial&quot; group by laws requiring racial segregation and prohibiting miscegenation. Prior to the Civil War, most free African Americans lived in the North, where slavery had been abolished. Free African Americans were often perceived as a job-stealing threat to society because they were usually willing to work for lower wages than white people. Moreover, they were seen as a dangerous influence on those who remained enslaved. Because of this, freed slaves were unwelcome in most areas of the United States.

In the South, vagrancy laws had allowed the states to force free African Americans into labor and sometimes to sell them into slavery. Nevertheless, free African Americans across the country performed a variety of occupations, including a small number who owned and operated successful farms. Others settled in Upper Canada (now Southern Ontario), an endpoint of the Underground Railroad, and in Nova Scotia.

In contrast to the northern United States where free African Americans were able to acquire substantial real estate, the institution of slavery in the southern United States deprived multiple generations of African Americans of the opportunity to own land. Legally, slaves could not own anything. But in practice, they did acquire capital. As legal slavery came to an end, white people did not agree on how freed slaves ought to be treated. Some maintained that the lands the freed slaves had farmed without compensation should be confiscated from their former owners and given to them. Others, fearing the &quot;race&quot;-mixing that allowing them to remain in the U.S. would inevitably bring about, wanted them sent &quot;somewhere else&quot;. Plans for a colony of freed slaves began in 1801 when James Monroe asked President Thomas Jefferson to help create a penal colony for rebellious blacks. 

The American Colonization Society (ACS) was formed in 1816 to address the issue of free African Americans through settlement (not resettlement) abroad. Although there was discussion of settling them in some undeveloped land in the new western territories or helping them emigrate to Canada or Mexico, the ACS decided to send them to Africa. They chose the closest available land, thereby minimizing transportation costs. However, colonization was slow and expensive and of little interest to most African Americans who had no ties with or interest in Africa. Some former slaves expressed that they were no more African than white Americans were British. Between 1822 and the American Civil War, the American Colonization Society had migrated approximately 15,000 free African Americans to Liberia. However, this number represented only a small fraction of the 7.5 million enslaved people who were about to be free. With mass emancipation looming, there was no consensus about what to do with the soon-to-be-free black slaves. This issue had long been known to white authorities as &quot;The Negro Problem&quot;.

Issuing a land grant to an entire class of people was not unusual in the 18th and 19th centuries. There was so much land that it was often given freely to anyone willing to farm it. For example, Thomas Jefferson included in his draft of a revolutionary constitution for Virginia in 1776 a proposed grant of 50 acres to any free man who did not already own that amount. Subsequently, the Preemption Act of 1841, followed by several Homestead Acts that were passed between 1862 and 1916, variously granted between 160 and 640 acres (a quarter section to a full section) of land. However, free African Americans were not generally eligible for homesteading because they were not citizens. This changed with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 which granted citizenship to &quot;all persons born or naturalized in the United States&quot;. This was further solidified by the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 which granted all citizens, regardless of &quot;race, color, or previous condition of servitude&quot;, the right to vote.

==War==
To empower the Union Army to legally seize property in its war with the South, Congress passed the Confiscation Act of 1861. This law allowed the military to seize rebel property, including land and slaves. In fact, it reflected the rapidly growing reality of black refugee camps that sprang up around the Union Army. These glaring manifestations of the &quot;Negro Problem&quot; provoked hostility from much of the Union rank-and-file—and necessitated administration by officers.

===Grand Contraband Camp===
After secession, the Union maintained its control over Fort Monroe in Hampton on the coast of Southern Virginia. Escaped slaves rushed to the area, hoping for protection from the Confederate Army. (Even more quickly, the town&#x27;s white residents fled to Richmond.) General Benjamin Butler set a precedent for Union forces on May 24, 1861, when he refused to surrender escaped slaves to Confederates claiming ownership. Butler declared the slaves contraband of war and allowed them to remain with the Union Army. By July 1861, there were 300 &quot;contraband&quot; slaves working for rations at Fort Monroe. By the end of July there were 900, and General Butler appointed Edward L. Pierce as Commissioner of Negro Affairs.

Confederate raiders under General John B. Magruder burnt the nearby town of Hampton, Virginia on August 7, 1861, but the &quot;contraband&quot; blacks occupied its ruins. They established a shantytown known as the Grand Contraband Camp. Many worked for the Army at a rate of $10.00/month, but these wages were not sufficient for them to make major improvements in housing. Conditions in the Camp grew worse, and Northern humanitarian groups sought to intervene on behalf of its 64,000 residents. Captain C. B. Wilder was appointed to organize a response. The perceived humanitarian crisis may have hastened Lincoln&#x27;s plans for colonizing Île-à-Vache.

A plan developed in September 1862 would have relocated refugees en masse to Massachusetts and other northern states. This plan—initiated by John A. Dix and supported by Captain Wilder and Secretary of War Stanton—drew negative reactions from Republicans who wanted to avoid connecting northward black migration with the newly announced Emancipation Proclamation. Fear of competition by black workers, as well as generalized racial prejudice, made the prospect of black refugees unpalatable for Massachusetts politicians.

With support from orders from General Rufus Saxton, General Butler and Captain Wilder pursued local resettlement operations, providing many of the blacks in Hampton with two acres of land and tools with which to work. Others were assigned jobs as servants in the North. Various smaller camps and colonies were formed, including the Freedmen&#x27;s Colony of Roanoke Island. Hampton was well known as one of the War&#x27;s first and biggest refugee camps, and served as a sort of model for other settlements.

===Sea Islands===

The Union Army occupied the Sea Islands after the November 1861 Battle of Port Royal, leaving the area&#x27;s many cotton plantations to the black farmers who worked on them. The early liberation of the Sea Island blacks, and the relatively unusual absence of the former white masters, raised the issue of how the South might be organized after the fall of slavery. Lincoln, commented State Department official Adam Gurowski, &quot;is frightened with the success in South Carolina, as in his opinion this success will complicate the question of slavery.&quot; In the early days of federal occupation, troops were badly mistreating the island&#x27;s residents, and had raided plantation supplies of food and clothing. One Union officer was caught preparing to secretly transport a group of blacks to Cuba, in order to sell them as slaves. Abuses by Union troops continued even after a stable regime had been established.

Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase had in December deployed Colonel William H. Reynolds to collect and sell whatever cotton could be confiscated from the Sea Island plantations. Soon after, Chase deployed Edward Pierce (after his brief period at Grand Contraband Camp) to assess the situation in Port Royal. Pierce found a plantation under strict Army control, paying wages too low to enable economic independence; he also criticized the Army&#x27;s policy of shipping cotton North to be ginned. Pierce reported that the black workers were experts in cotton farming but required white managers &quot;to enforce a paternal discipline&quot;. He recommended the establishment of a supervised black farming collective to prepare the workers for the responsibilities of citizenship—and to serve as a model for post-slavery labor relations in the South.

The Treasury Department sought to raise money and in many cases was already leasing occupied territories to Northern capitalists for private management. For Port Royal Colonel Thomas had already prepared an arrangement of this type; but Pierce insisted that Port Royal offered the chance to &quot;settle a great social question&quot;: namely, whether &quot;when properly organized, and with proper motives set before them, [blacks] will as freemen be as industrious as any race of men are likely to be in this climate.&quot; Chase sent Pierce to see President Lincoln. As Pierce later described the encounter:

Pierce accepted this reluctant mandate, but feared that &quot;some unhappy compromise&quot; might compromise his plan to engineer black citizenship.

====Port Royal Experiment====

The collective was established and became known as the Port Royal Experiment: a possible model for black economic activity after slavery. The Experiment attracted support from Northerners like economist Edward Atkinson, who hoped to prove his theory that free labor would be more productive than slave labor. More traditional abolitionists like Maria Weston Chapman also praised Pierce&#x27;s plan. Civic groups like the American Missionary Association provided enthusiastic assistance. These sympathetic Northerners quickly recruited a boatload (53 chosen from a pool of applicants several times larger) of Ivy League and divinity school graduates who set off for Port Royal on March 3, 1862.

The residents of Port Royal generally resented the military and civilian occupiers, who exhibited racist superiority in varying degrees of overtness. Joy turned to sorrow when, on May 12 Union soldiers arrived to draft all able-bodied black men previously liberated on April 13, 1862, by General David Hunter who proclaimed slavery abolished in Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. Hunter kept his regiment even after Lincoln reversed this tri-state emancipation proclamation; but disbanded almost all of it when unable to draw payroll from the War Department. Black farmers preferred to grow vegetables and catch fish, whereas the missionaries (and other whites on the islands) encouraged monoculture of cotton as a cash crop. In the thinking of the latter, civilization would be advanced by incorporating blacks into the consumer economy dominated by Northern manufacturing.

Meanwhile, various conflicts arose among the missionaries, the Army, and the merchants whom Chase and Reynolds had invited to Port Royal in order to confiscate all that could be sold. On balance, however, the white sponsors of the Experiment had perceived positive results; businessman John Murray Forbes in May 1862 called it &quot;a decided success&quot;, announcing that Blacks would indeed work in exchange for wages.

Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton appointed General Rufus Saxton as military governor of Port Royal in April 1862, and by December Saxton was agitating for permanent black control over the land. He won support from Stanton, Chase, Sumner, and President Lincoln, but met continuing resistance from a tax commission that wanted to sell the land. Saxton also received approval to train a black militia, which formally became the 1st South Carolina Volunteers on January 1, 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation legalized its existence.

====Landownership in the Sea Islands====
As elsewhere, black workers felt strongly that they had a claim to the lands they worked.

The Confiscation Act of 1862 allowed the Treasury Department to sell many captured lands on the grounds of delinquent taxes. All told, the government now claimed 76,775 acres of Sea Island land. Auditors arrived in Port Royal and began to assess the estates now occupied by blacks and missionaries. The stakes were high: the Sea Island cotton harvest represented a lucrative commodity for Northern investors to control.

Most of the whites involved in the project felt that black ownership of the land should be its final result. Saxton—along with journalists including &quot;Free South&quot; editor James G. Thompson, and missionaries including Methodist minister Mansfield French—lobbied hard for distribution of the land to black owners. In January 1863, Saxton unilaterally halted the Treasury Department&#x27;s tax sale on the grounds of military necessity.

The tax commissioners conducted the auction regardless, selling ten thousand acres of land. Eleven plantations went to a consortium (&quot;The Boston Concern&quot;) headed by Edward Philbrick, who sold the land in 1865 to black farmers. One black farming collective outbid the outside investors, paying an average of $7.00 per acre for the 470 plantation on which they already lived and worked. Overall, the majority of the land was sold to Northern investors and remained under their control.

In September 1863, Lincoln announced a plan to auction 60,000 acres of South Carolina land in lots of 320 acres—setting aside 16,000 acres of the land for &quot;heads of families of the African race&quot;, who could obtain 20-acre lots sold at $1.25/acre (). Tax Commissioner William Brisbane envisioned racial integration on the islands, with large plantation owners employing landless blacks. But Saxton and French considered the 16,000-acre reserve to be inadequate, and instructed black families to stake claims and build houses on all 60,000 acres of the land. French traveled to Washington in December 1863 to lobby for legal confirmation of the plan. At French&#x27;s urging, Chase and Lincoln authorized Sea Island families (and solitary wives of soldiers in the Union Army) to claim 40-acre plots. Other individuals over the age of 21 would be allowed to claim 20 acres. These plots would be purchased at $1.25 per acre, with 40% paid upfront and 60% paid later. With a requirement of six months&#x27; prior residency, the order functionally restricted settlement to blacks, missionaries, and others who were already involved in the Experiment.

Claims to land under the new plan began to arrive immediately, but Commissioner Brisbane ignored them, hoping for another reversal of the decision in Washington. Chase did indeed reverse his position in February, restoring the plan for a tax sale. The sale took place in late February, with land selling for an average price of more than $11/acre (). The sale provoked outcry from freedpeople who had already claimed land according to Chase&#x27;s December order.

====&quot;Negroes of Savannah&quot;====

Major General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s &quot;March to the Sea&quot; brought a massive regiment of the Union Army to the Georgia coast in December 1864. Accompanying the Army were an estimated ten thousand black refugees, former slaves. This group was already suffering from starvation and disease. Many former slaves had become disillusioned by the Union Army, having suffered pillaging, rape, and other abuses. They arrived in Savannah &quot;after long marches and severe privations, &quot;weary, famished, sick, and almost naked&quot;. On December 19, Sherman dispatched many of these slaves to Hilton Head, an island already serving as refugee camp. Saxton reported on December 22 &quot;Every cabin and house on these islands is filled to overflowing—I have some 15,000.&quot; 700 more arrived on Christmas.

On January 11, 1865, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton arrived in Savannah with Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs and other officials. This group met with Generals Sherman and Saxton to discuss the refugee crisis. They decided, in turn, to consult leaders from the local Black community and ask them: &quot;What do you want for your own people?&quot; A meeting was duly arranged.

At 8:00 PM on January 12, 1865, Sherman met with a group of twenty people, many of whom had been slaves for most of their lives. The blacks of Savannah had seized the opportunity of emancipation to strengthen their community&#x27;s institutions, and they had strong political feelings. They selected one spokesperson: Garrison Frazier, the 67-year-old former pastor of Third African Baptist. In the late 1850s, he had for $1,000 bought freedom for himself and his wife. Frazier had consulted with the refugees as well as the other representatives. He told Sherman: &quot;The way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor.&quot; Frazier suggested that young men would serve the government in fighting the Rebels, and that therefore &quot;the women and children and old men&quot; would have to work this land. Almost all of those present agreed to request land grants for autonomous black communities, on the grounds that racial hatred would prevent economic advancement for blacks in mixed areas.

====Sherman&#x27;s Special Field Orders, No. 15====
Sherman&#x27;s Special Field Orders, No. 15, issued on January 16, 1865, instructed officers to settle these refugees on the Sea Islands and inland: 400,000 total acres divided into 40-acre plots. Though mules (beasts of burden used for plowing) were not mentioned, some of its beneficiaries did receive them from the army. Such plots were colloquially known as &quot;Blackacres&quot;.

Sherman&#x27;s orders specifically allocated &quot;the islands from Charleston, south, the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the St. Johns River, Florida.&quot; The order specifically prohibits whites from settling in this area. Saxton, who, with Stanton, helped to craft the document, was promoted to major general and charged with oversight of the new settlement. On February 3, Saxton addressed a large freedpeople&#x27;s meeting at Second African Baptist, announcing the order and outlining preparations for new settlement. By June 1865, about 40,000 freedpeople were settled on in the Sea Islands.

The Special Field Orders were issued by Sherman, not the federal government with regards to all former slaves, and he issued similar ones &quot;throughout the campaign to assure the harmony of action in the area of operations.&quot; It was claimed by some that these settlements were never intended to last. However, this was never the understanding of the settlers—nor of General Saxton, who said he asked Sherman to cancel the order unless it was meant to be permanent.

In practice, the areas of land settled were quite variable. James Chaplin Beecher observed that the &quot;so called 40 acre tract[s] vary in size from eight acres to (450) four hundred and fifty.&quot; Some areas were settled by groups: Skidaway Island was colonized by a group of over 1000 people, including Reverend Ulysses L. Houston.

====Significance====
The Sea Islands project reflected a policy of &quot;40 acres and a mule&quot; as the basis for post-slavery economics. Especially in 1865, the precedent it set was highly visible to newly free blacks seeking land of their own.

Freedpeople from across the region flocked to the area in search of land. The result was refugee camps afflicted by disease and short on supplies.

Especially after Sherman&#x27;s Orders, the coastal settlements generated enthusiasm for a new society that would supplant the slave system. Reported one journalist in April 1865: &quot;It was the Plymouth colony repeating itself. They agreed if any others came to join them, they should have equal privileges. So blooms the Mayflower on the South Atlantic Coast.&quot;

===Wage labor system===
Beginning in occupied Louisiana under General Nathaniel P. Banks, the military developed a wage-labor system for cultivating large areas of land. This system—which took effect with Lincoln and Stanton&#x27;s blessing soon after the Emancipation Proclamation legitimized contracts with the freedpeople—offered ironclad one-year contracts to freedpeople. The contract promised $10/month as well as provisions and medical care. The system was soon also adopted by General Lorenzo Thomas in Mississippi.

Sometimes land came under the control of Treasury officials. Jurisdictional disputes erupted between the Treasury Department and the military. Criticism of Treasury Department profiteering by General John Eaton and journalists who witnessed the new form of plantation labor influenced public opinion in the North and pressured Congress to support direct control of land by freedmen. The Treasury Department, particularly as Secretary Chase prepared to seek the Republican nomination in 1864, accused the military of treating the freedpeople inhumanely. Lincoln decided in favor of military rather than Treasury jurisdiction, and the wage labor system became more deeply established. Abolitionist critics of the policy called it no better than serfdom.

===Davis Bend===
One of the largest black landownership projects took place at Davis Bend, Mississippi, the 11,000-acre site of plantations owned by Joseph Davis and his famous younger brother Jefferson, president of the Confederacy. Influenced by some aspects of Robert Owen&#x27;s socialism, Joseph Davis had established the experimental 4000-acre Hurricane Plantation in 1827 at Davis Bend. Davis allowed several hundred slaves to eat nutritious food, live in well-built cottages, receive medical care, and resolve their disputes in a weekly &quot;Hall of Justice&quot; court. His motto was: &quot;The less people are governed, the more submissive they will be to control.&quot; Davis relied heavily on the managerial skills of Ben Montgomery, a well-educated slave who conducted much of the plantation&#x27;s business.

The Battle of Shiloh began a period of turmoil (1862–1863), at Davis Bend, although its black residents continued farming. The plantation was occupied by two companies of black Union troops in December 1863. Under the command of Colonel Samuel Thomas, these soldiers began to fortify the area. General Ulysses S. Grant had expressed a desire to make of the Davis plantations &quot;a negro paradise.&quot; Thomas began to lease the land to black tenants for the 1864 crop season. Black refugees who had gathered in Vicksburg moved &quot;en masse&quot; to Davis Bend under the auspices of the Freedman&#x27;s Department (an agency created by the military prior to Congressional authorization of the &quot;Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau&quot;, discussed below).

Davis Bend was caught in the middle of the turf war between the military and the Treasury Department. In February 1864, the Treasury re-confiscated 2000 acres of Davis Bend, restoring them to white owners who had sworn loyalty oaths. It also leased 1,200 acres to Northern investors. Although Thomas resisted instructions to prevent the free blacks from farming, General Eaton ordered him to comply. Eaton also ordered Thomas to confiscate farming equipment held by blacks, on the grounds that—because Mississippi law banned slaves from owning property—they must have stolen such possessions. The Treasury Department sought to charge the plantation workers a fee for using the cotton gin. The residents of Davis Bend objected strenuously to these measures. In a petition signed by 56 farmers (including Montgomery) and published in the New Orleans &quot;Tribune&quot;:

At the commencement of our present year, this plantation was, in compliance with an order of our Post Commander, deprived of horses, mules, oxen and farming utensils of every description, very much of which had been captured and brought into Union lines by the undersigned; in consequence of which deprivations, we were, of course, reduced to the necessity of buying everything necessary for farming, and having thus far succeeded in performing by far the most expensive and laborious part of our work, we are prepared to accomplish the ginning, pressing, weighing, marking, consigning, etc., in a business-like order if allowed to do so.

==Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau==
From 1863 to 1865, Congress debated what policies it might adopt to address the social issues that would confront the South after the war. The Freedmen&#x27;s Aid Society pushed for a &quot;Bureau of Emancipation&quot; to assist in the economic transition away from slavery. It used Port Royal as evidence that blacks could live and work on their own. Land reform was often discussed, though some objected that too much capital would be required to ensure the success of black farmers. On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives approved the 13th Amendment, which outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude except in the case of punishment.

Congress continued to debate the economic and social status of the free population, with land reform identified as critical to realizing black freedom. A bill drafted in conference committee to provide limited land tenure for one year while authorizing military supervision of freedmen was rejected in the Senate by abolitionists who thought it did not do justice to the freedmen. A six-person committee quickly wrote &quot;an entirely new bill&quot; which substantially increased its promise to the freedmen.

This stronger version of the bill passed both houses on March 3, 1865. With this bill, Congress established the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands under the War Department. The Bureau had authority to provide supplies for refugees—and an unfunded mandate to redistribute land, in parcels of up to 40 acres:

Sec. 4. &quot;And be it further enacted,&quot; That the commissioner, under the direction of the President, shall have authority to set apart, for the use of loyal refugees and freedmen, such tracts of land within the insurrectionary states as shall have been abandoned, or to which the United States shall have acquired title by confiscation or sale, or otherwise, and to every male citizen, whether refugee or freedman, as aforesaid, there shall be assigned not more than forty acres of such land, and the person to whom it was so assigned shall be protected in the use and enjoyment of the land for the term of three years at an annual rent not exceeding six per centum upon the value of such land, as it was appraised by the state authorities in the year eighteen hundred and sixty, for the purpose of taxation, and in case no such appraisal can be found, then the rental shall be based upon the estimated value of the land in said year, to be ascertained in such manner as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe. At the end of said term, or at any time during said term, the occupants of any parcels so assigned may purchase the land and receive such title thereto as the United States can convey, upon paying therefor the value of the land, as ascertained and fixed for the purpose of determining the annual rent aforesaid.

The bill thus established a system in which Southern blacks could lease abandoned and confiscated land, with yearly rent at 6% (or less) of the land&#x27;s value (assessed for tax purposes in 1860). After three years, they would have the option to buy this land at full price. The Bureau in charge, which became known as the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, was placed under the continuing supervision of the military because Congress anticipated the need to defend black settlements from White Southerners. The bill mandated institutionalized black landownership of the same land that had formerly relied on their unpaid labor.

After Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Andrew Johnson became president. On May 29, 1865, Johnson issued an amnesty proclamation to ordinary Southern citizens who swore loyalty oaths, promising not only political immunity but also return of confiscated property. (Johnson&#x27;s proclamation excluded Confederate politicians, military officers, and landowners with property worth more than $20,000.) General O. O. Howard, chief of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, requested an interpretation from Attorney General James Speed regarding how this proclamation would affect the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau mandate. Speed replied on June 22, 1865, that the Bureau Commissioner:

... has &quot;authority&quot;, under the direction of the President, to set apart for the use of loyal refugees and freedmen the lands in question; and he is &quot;required&quot; to assign to every male of that class of persons, not more than forty acres of such lands.

===Circular #13===

Howard acted quickly based on the authorization from Speed, ordering an inventory of lands available for redistribution and resisting white Southerners&#x27; attempts to reclaim property. At its peak in 1865, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau controlled 800,000–900,000 acres of plantation lands previously belonging to slave owners. This area represented 0.2% of land in the South; ultimately the Johnson proclamation required the Bureau to re-allocate most of it to its former owners.

On July 28, 1865, Howard issued &quot;Circular no. 13&quot;, a directive within the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau to issue land to refugees and freedmen. Circular no. 13 explicitly instructed Bureau agents to prioritize the Congressional mandate for land distribution over Johnson&#x27;s amnesty declaration. Its final section clarified: &quot;The pardon of the President will not be understood to extend to the surrender of abandoned or confiscated property which by law has been &#x27;set apart for Refugees and Freedmen&#x27;&quot;. With Circular #13, land redistribution was an official policy for the entire South, and understood as such by army officers.

After issuing Circular 13, however, Howard, seemingly unaware of how significant and controversial his instructions might prove, left Washington for a vacation in Maine. President Johnson and others began to counteract the Circular almost immediately. After Johnson ordered the Bureau to restore the estate of a complaining Tennessee plantation owner, General Joseph S. Fullerton suggested to at least one subordinate that Circular #13 &quot;will not be observed for the present&quot;.

When Howard returned to Washington, Johnson ordered him to write a new Circular that would respect his policy of land restoration. Johnson rejected Howard&#x27;s draft and wrote his own version, which he issued on September 12 as Circular #15—including Howard&#x27;s name. Circular #15 established strict criteria for designating a property as &quot;officially confiscated&quot; and had the effect in many places of ending land redistribution completely.

Especially during the six-week period between Circular #13 and Circular #15, &#x27;40 acres and a mule&#x27; (along with other supplies necessary for farming) represented a common promise of Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau agents. Clinton B. Fisk, Assistant Commissioner of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau for Kentucky and Tennessee, had announced at a black political assembly: &quot;They must not only have freedom but homes of their own, thirty or forty acres, with mules, cottages, and schoolhouses etc.&quot;

A Bureau administrator in Virginia proposed leasing to each family a 40-acre plot of land, a pair of mules, harnesses, a cart, tools, seeds, and food supplies. The family would pay for these supplies after growing crops and selling them.

===Black Codes===

Bureau agents encountered legal problems in allocating land to freedpeople as a result of the &quot;Black Codes&quot; passed by Southern legislatures in late 1865 and 1866. Some of the new laws prevented black people from owning or leasing land. The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau generally treated the black Codes as invalid, based on federal legislation. However, the Bureau was not always able to enforce its interpretation after the Union Army had substantially demobilized.

==Colonization and homesteading==
During and after the war, politicians, generals and others envisioned a variety of colonization plans that would have provided real estate to black families. Although the American Colonization Society had been colonizing more people in Liberia and receiving more donations (almost one million dollars in the 1850s), it did not have the means to respond to mass emancipation.

A 2020 study contrasted the successful distribution of free land to former slaves in the Cherokee Nation with the failure to give free land to former slaves in the Confederacy. The study found that even though levels of inequality in 1860 were similar in the Cherokee Nation and the Confederacy, former black slaves prospered in the Cherokee Nation over the next decades. The Cherokee Nation had lower levels of racial inequality, higher incomes for black people, higher literacy rates among black people, and greater school attendance rates among black people.

===Foreign colonization plans===
Lincoln had long supported colonization as a plausible solution to the problem of slavery, and pursued colonization plans throughout his presidency. In 1862, Congress approved $600,000 to fund Lincoln&#x27;s plan for colonizing blacks &quot;in a climate congenial to them&quot;, and granted Lincoln broad executive powers to orchestrate colonization. Lincoln immediately created an Emigration Office within the Department of the Interior and instructed the State Department to acquire suitable land. The first major plan considered would have sent employed free blacks as coal miners in Chiriquí Province, Panama (then part of Gran Colombia). Volunteers were promised 40 acres of land and a job in the mines; Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy, whom Lincoln had appointed to oversee the plan, had also purchased mules, yokes, tools, wagons, seeds, and other supplies to support a potential colony. Pomeroy accepted 500 of the 13,700 people who applied for the job. However, the plan was canceled by the end of the year, thanks to a discovery that Chiriquí&#x27;s coal was of poor quality.

Like Liberia, an independent black nation, Haiti was also considered a good place to colonize freedpeople from the U.S. As the Chiriquí plan was hitting its stride in 1862, Lincoln was developing another plan to colonize the small island of Île à Vache near Haiti. Lincoln struck a deal with businessman Bernard Kock, who had obtained rights to lease the island for cultivation and wood-cutting. A total of 453 Blacks, mostly young men from the Tidewater region around occupied Hampton, Virginia, volunteered to colonize the island. On April 14, 1863, they left Fort Monroe in the &quot;Ocean Ranger&quot;. Kock confiscated all of the money possessed by the colonists and did not pay their wages. Initial reports suggested dire conditions, though these were later disputed. A number of colonists died in the first year. 292 survivors from the original group remained on the island and 73 had moved to Aux Cayes; most were restored to the U.S. by a mission of the Navy in February 1864. Congress rescinded Lincoln&#x27;s colonization authority in July 1863.

Lincoln continued to pursue colonization plans, particularly in the British West Indies, but none came to fruition. The American Colonization Society settled a few hundred people in Liberia during the war, and several thousand more in the five years following.

===Domestic colonization plans===
Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest had proposed in 1865 before the end of the war to hire black soldiers and freedmen in constructing a railroad for the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company, paying them with $1 (~$ in )/day and land along the railway line. This proposal later gained the endorsements of Sherman, Howard, Johnson, and Arkansas Governor Isaac Murphy. Howard transported several hundred freedmen from Alabama to Arkansas for work on the line. He appointed Edward Ord to supervise the project and protect the freedmen from Forrest.

===Southern Homesteading Act===

As it became clear that the pool of land available for blacks was rapidly shrinking, the Union discussed various proposals for how blacks might resettle and eventually own their own land. In Virginia, the mass of landless blacks represented a growing crisis—soon to be exacerbated by the return of 10,000 black soldiers from Texas. Concerned about a possible insurrection, Colonel Orlando Brown (head of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau in Virginia) proposed relocating Virginia&#x27;s blacks to Texas or Florida. Brown proposed that the federal government reserve 500,000 acres in Florida for colonization by the soldiers and 50,000 other free blacks from Virginia. Howard took Brown&#x27;s proposal to Congress.

In December 1865, Congress began to debate the &quot;Second Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau bill&quot;, which would have opened three million acres of unoccupied public land in Florida, Mississippi, and Arkansas for homesteading. (An amendment to allow black homesteading on public lands in the North was defeated.) Congress passed the bill in February 1866 but could not override Johnson&#x27;s veto. (Congress passed a more limited &quot;Second Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau Bill&quot; in July 1866, and did override Johnson&#x27;s veto.)

Howard continued to push for Congress to appropriate land for allocation to freedmen. With support from Thaddeus Stevens and William Fessenden, Congress began to debate a new bill for black settlement of public lands in the South. The result was the Southern Homestead Act, which opened 46,398,544.87 acres of land in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas to homesteading; initially 80-acre parcels (half-quarter section) until June 1868, and thereafter 160-acre parcels (quarter section). Johnson signed this bill and it went into effect on June 21, 1866. Until January 1, 1867, the bill specified, only free blacks and loyal whites would be allowed access to these lands.

Howard, concerned about competition with Confederates that would begin in 1867, ordered Bureau agents to inform free blacks about the Homesteading Act. Local commissioners did not disseminate the information widely, and many freedpeople were unwilling to venture into unknown territory, with insufficient supplies, based only on the promise of land after five years.

Those who did attempt homesteading encountered unreliable bureaucracy that often did not comply with federal law. They also faced extremely harsh conditions, usually on low quality land that had been rejected by white settlers in years past. Nevertheless, free blacks entered about 6,500 claims to homesteads; about 1000 of these eventually resulted in property certificates.

==Outcomes==
Southern landowners regained control over almost all of the land they had claimed before the war. The national dialogue about land ownership as a key to success for freed people gave way (in the sphere of white politics and media) to the implementation of a plantation wage system. Under pressure from Johnson and other pro-capital politicians in the North, and from almost all of white society in the South, the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau was transformed from a protector of land rights to an enforcer of wage labor.

Free blacks in the South widely believed that all land would be redistributed to those who had worked on it. They also felt strongly that they had a right to own this land. Many expected this event to occur by Christmas 1865 or New Year&#x27;s 1866. Although the freedpeople formed this belief in response to the policies of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and Circular #13, their hopes were soon downplayed as superstition akin to belief in Santa Claus.

Hope for &quot;40 acres and a mule&quot; specifically was prevalent beginning in early 1865. The expectation of &quot;40 acres&quot; came from the explicit terms of Sherman&#x27;s Field Order and the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau bill. The &quot;mule&quot; may have been added simply as an obvious necessity for achieving prosperity through agriculture. (&quot;Forty acres&quot; was a slogan, which though it did appear often in formal declarations, represented a wide variety of different arrangements for land ownership and farming.)

A counter-rumor spread among Southern whites that when the land was &quot;not&quot; redistributed on Christmas, angry blacks would launch a violent insurrection. Alabama and Mississippi passed laws forming White paramilitary groups, which violently disarmed free black people.

According to historian Donald R. Shaffer: The fact was, however, that not all African Americans were enthusiastic about land redistribution. The black elite in the South, which disproportionately consisted of those who had been free before the war and the lightskinned, tended to emphasize suffrage and equal rights over economic issues. Consisting of property owners, or men who realistically aspired to buy property one day, these black men tended to oppose land confiscation and redistribution. They made common cause with white Republicans on this issue, few of whom supported confiscating land from ex-Confederates—even among the Radical Republicans. The fact that members of the elite predominated among black officeholders during Reconstruction also meant they rarely pushed this issue in Congress or state legislatures (not that it had much chance of passing even if they had, due to white majorities in these bodies). Hence, most African Americans during Reconstruction did not achieve the dramatic economic progress comparable to that demonstrated by their race in politics. 

===Wage labor===

Southern farm owners complained that because they were waiting for land, the newly free blacks would not readily sign long-term labor contracts. South Carolina Governor James Lawrence Orr asked Johnson in 1866 to continue pushing his land policy, writing that &quot;complete restoration will restore complete harmony&quot;.

Black hopes for land came to be seen as a major barrier to economic productivity, and forces from both South and North worked hard to dispel them. Southern governments passed &quot;Black Codes&quot; to prevent blacks from owning or leasing land, and to restrict their freedom of movement. Agents of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau now told blacks that redistribution was impossible and that they would need to perform wage labor to survive. If they could not persuade people to sign contracts, they would insist forcefully. Thomas Conway, the Bureau Commissioner in Louisiana, ordered: &quot;Hire them out! Cut wood! Do anything to avoid a state of idleness.&quot; Even Rufus Saxton, who campaigned actively for black property in the Sea Islands, issued a Circular instructing his agents to dispel the rumor of redistribution at New Year&#x27;s 1866. (The unfunded Bureau drew its own finances from profits generated by freedpeople under contract.) Although some Whites continued to press for colonization, most now believed that black labor could be recuperated through the wage system.

According to many historians, economic negotiations between blacks and whites in the South thus unfolded within the parameters dictated by the Johnson administration. Southern plantation owners pushed blacks toward servitude, while the Republican Congress pushed for free wage labor and civil rights. Eventually, under this framework, sharecropping emerged as the dominant mode of production. Some historians, such as Robert McKenzie, have challenged the prevalence of this &quot;standard scenario&quot; and argued that land ownership fluctuated significantly during the 1870s. Black land ownership did increase across the South.

===Tidewater Virginia===
Many blacks who had settled on property surrounding Hampton were forced to leave by various means. These included Johnson&#x27;s aggressive restoration policy, Black Codes passed by the Virginia legislature, and with vigilante enforcement by returning Confederates. Union troops also forcefully evicted settlers, sometimes provoking violent standoffs; many blacks came to trust the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau no more than they did the Rebels. In 1866 Tidewater&#x27;s refugee camps were still full, and many of their residents were sick and dying. Relations with Northern and Southern whites had become violently hostile. The whites (military occupiers and local residents) agreed on a plan to deport the freedpeople back to their counties of origin.

After the turbulence of restoration, land ownership steadily increased. Hampton already had at least some black landowners, such as the family of American Revolutionary War veteran Caesar Tarrant. In 1860, about eight free Negroes owned land in Hampton. By 1870, approximately 121 free Blacks owned land in the area. Those who owned land before the war expanded their holdings.

Some of the blacks in Hampton formed a community land trust called Lincoln&#x27;s Land Association and purchased several hundred acres of surrounding land. Land for the Hampton Institute (later Hampton University), was acquired from 1867 to 1872 with assistance from George Whipple of the American Missionary Association. Whipple also helped to sell 44 individual lots to black owners.

Many freedpeople could not afford to purchase land immediately after the war but earned money in jobs outside farming such as fishing and oystering. Black land ownership thus increased even faster (though not for everyone) during the 1870s. In Charles City County, three-quarters of black farm workers owned their own farms, with an average size of 36 acres. In York County, 50% owned their farms, which averaged 20 acres. (Statedwide, the number of landowners was high, but the average size of land was only 4 acres.) These relatively small farms, on relatively poor land, did not generate enormous profits. However, they did constitute a base of economic power, and blacks from this region held political office at a high rate.

Survivors of the camps also achieved a high level of land ownership and business success in the town of Hampton itself.

===Sea Islands===

The May 29 amnesty proclamation did not apply to many Sea Islands landowners; however, most of these had secured special pardons directly from Johnson. General Rufus Saxton was overwhelmed with ownership claims for properties in the &quot;Sherman Reserve&quot;. Saxton wrote to Howard on September 5, 1865, asking him to protect black landownership on the Sea Islands:

Circular no. 15, issued days later, led the land&#x27;s former owners to increase their efforts. Saxton continued to resist, passing their written requests to Howard with the comment:

Johnson dispatched Howard to the Islands, with instructions to broker a &quot;mutually satisfactory&quot; settlement. Howard understood that this implied a complete restoration of pre-war ownership. He informed the islanders of Johnson&#x27;s intention. But (with support from Stanton, who felt comfortable with a literal interpretation of the phrase &quot;mutually satisfactory&quot;) appointed a sympathetic captain, Alexander P. Ketchum, to form a commission overseeing the transition. Ketchum and Saxton proceeded to resist resettlement claims by Confederate whites.

The settlers formed a solidarity network to resist reclamation of their lands and proved willing to defend their homes with vigorous displays of force. The Sea Island homesteaders also wrote directly to Howard and Johnson, insisting that the government keep its promise and maintain their homesteads.

However, the prevailing political wind continued to favor the Southern landowners. Saxton and Ketchum lost their positions; Daniel Sickles and Robert K. Scott assumed power. In the winter of 1866–1867, Sickles turned the Union Army on the settlers, evicting all those that could not produce the correct deed. Black settlers retained control over 1,565 titles amounting to 63,000 acres. Scott recounted in his report to Congress: &quot;The officers of these detachments in many instances took from the freedmen their certificates, declared them worthless, and destroyed them in their presence. Upon refusing to accept the contracts offered, the people in several instances were thrust out into the highways, where, being without shelter, many perished from small-pox, which prevailed to an alarming extent among them.&quot;

Soldiers continued to evict settlers and enforce work agreements, leading in 1867 to a large-scale armed standoff between the Army and a group of farmers who would not renew their contract with a plantation owner. General Davis Tillson in Georgia ordered a modification to the title of black landowners &quot;as to give a man holding one, not forty acres, but as much land as he could work &quot;well&quot;, say from ten to fifteen acres—and that the balance of the land should be turned over to Messrs. Scuyler and Winchester, who should be allowed to hire the remaining freed people who wish to work for them [...]&quot;. 90% of the land on Skidaway Island was confiscated.

The (second) Second Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau bill, passed in July 1866 over Johnson&#x27;s veto, stipulated the freedpeople whose lands had been restored to Confederate owners could pay $1.25 (~$ in ) per acre for up to 20 acres of land in St. Luke and St. Helena parishes of Beaufort County, South Carolina. This district was overseen by Major Martin R. Delaney, an abolitionist and advocate of black land ownership. About 1,900 families with land titles resettled in Beaufort County, buying 19,040 acres of land at relatively low rates.

Many people remained on the islands and maintained the Gullah culture of their ancestors. Several hundred thousand Gullah people live on the Sea Islands today. Their claim to the land has been threatened in recent decades by developers seeking to build vacation resorts.

===Davis Bend===

Thomas denied their request and accused Montgomery of having promoted the petition to further his own profits. Montgomery appealed to Joseph Davis, who had returned to Mississippi in October 1865 and was staying in Vicksburg.

Samuel Thomas was eventually removed from his post. Joseph Davis regained control of his plantation in 1867 and promptly sold it to Benjamin Montgomery for $300,000 (~$ in ). This price, $75 per acre, was comparatively low. The transaction itself was illegal because the Mississippi Black Codes outlawed sale of property to blacks; Davis and Montgomery therefore conducted the deal in secret.

Montgomery invited free blacks to settle the land and work there. In 1887, led by Benjamin&#x27;s son Isaiah Montgomery, the group founded a new settlement at Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Mound Bayou remains an autonomous and virtually all-Black community.

===Politics===

Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner continued to support land reform for freedpeople, but were opposed by a large bloc of politicians who did not want to violate property rights or redistribute capital.

Many radical Northerners withdrew their support for land reform in the years following the war. One reason for the shift in political opinion was fear by the Republicans that land ownership might lead Blacks to align with Democrats for economic reasons. In general, politicians turned their focus to the legal status of freedpeople. In the analysis of W. E. B. Du Bois, black suffrage became more politically palatable precisely as an inexpensive alternative to well-funded agrarian reform.

==Orders==
The orders were issued following Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. They were intended to address the immediate problem of dealing with the tens of thousands of black refugees who had joined Sherman&#x27;s march in search of protection and sustenance, and &quot;to assure the harmony of action in the area of operations.&quot; Critics allege that his intention was for the order to be a temporary measure to address an immediate problem, and not to grant permanent ownership of the land to the freedmen, although most of the recipients assumed otherwise. General Sherman issued his orders four days after meeting with twenty local black ministers and lay leaders and with U.S. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton in Savannah, Georgia. Brig. Gen. Rufus Saxton, an abolitionist from Massachusetts who had previously organized the recruitment of black soldiers for the Union Army, was put in charge of implementing the orders. Freedmen were settled in Georgia, particularly along the Savannah River, in the Ogeechee district of Chatham County, and on islands off of the coast of Savannah.

===Publication in the Official Record===
This order is part of the Official Records of the American Civil War. It can be found in Series I – Military Operations, Volume XLVII, Part II, Pages 60–62. The volume was published in 1895.

==Legacy==
According to Henry Louis Gates Jr.: The promise was the first systematic attempt to provide a form of reparations to newly freed slaves, and it was astonishingly radical for its time, proto-socialist in its implications. In fact, such a policy would be radical in any country today: the federal government&#x27;s massive confiscation of private propertysome 400,000 acresformerly owned by Confederate land owners, and its methodical redistribution to former black slaves.

According to historian John David Smith:
:&quot;What does this history teach us? Yes, the historical record disproves assertions that the federal government reneged on promises to grant the freedpeople &quot;forty acres and a mule.&quot; But the fact that the government never made such a promise in the first place tells us something about how black people were treated in 19th-century America. Moreover, it is important to remember that the freedpeople desperately wanted land, believed that they had been deceived, and felt betrayed. The legacy of that sense of betrayal lingers on. After 138 years, the stubborn myth of &quot;forty acres and a mule&quot; remains a political football and a sober reminder of the ex-slaves&#x27; broken hopes and shattered dreams.

By the 1870s, blacks had abandoned hope of federal land redistribution, but many still saw &quot;forty acres and a mule&quot; as the key to freedom. Black land ownership in the South increased steadily despite the failure of federal Reconstruction. One quarter of black farmers in the South owned their land by 1900. Near the coast, they owned an average of 27 acres; inland, an average of 48 acres. By comparison, 63% of Southern white farmers owned their land. Most of this land was simply bought through private transactions.

In 1910, black Americans owned 15,000,000 acres of land, most of it in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This figure has since declined to 5,500,000 acres in 1980 and to 2,000,000 acres in 1997. Most of this land is not the area held by black families in 1910; beyond the &quot;Black Belt&quot;, it is located in Texas, Oklahoma, and California. The total number of Black farmers has decreased from 925,708 in 1920 to 18,000 in 1997; the number of white farmers has also decreased, but much more slowly. Black American land ownership has diminished more than that of any other ethnic group, while white land ownership has increased. Black families who inherit land across generations without obtaining an explicit title (often resulting in tenancy in common by multiple descendants) may have difficulty gaining government benefits and risk losing their land completely. Outright fraud and lynchings have also been used to strip black people of their land.

Black landowners are common targets of eminent domain laws invoked to make way for public works projects. At Harris Neck in the Sea Islands, a group of Gullah freedpeople retained 2,681 acres of high-quality land due to the Will of the plantation owner Marg[a]ret Ann Harris. About 100 black farmers continued to live at Harris Neck until 1942, when they were forced off the land because of a plan to build an Air Force base. The land was used freely by local white authorities until 1962, when it was turned over to the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and became Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge. Ownership of the land remains contested.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has long been viewed as a cause for the decline in black agriculture. According to a 1997 report by the USDA&#x27;s own Civil Rights Action Team:

There are some who call the USDA &#x27;the last plantation.&#x27; An &#x27;old line&#x27; department, USDA was one of the last federal agencies to integrate and perhaps the last to include women and minorities in leadership positions. Considered a stubborn bureaucracy and slow to change, USDA is also perceived as playing a key role in what some see as a conspiracy to force minority and socially disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.

A class action lawsuit has accused the USDA of systematic discrimination against black farmers from 1981 to 1999. In &quot;Pigford v. Glickman&quot; (1999), District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman ruled in favor of the farmers and ordered the USDA to pay financial damages for loss of land and revenue. However, the status of full compensation for affected farmers remains unresolved.

===Symbolism===
The phrase &quot;40 acres and a mule&quot; has come to symbolize the broken promise that Reconstruction policies would offer economic justice for African Americans.

The &quot;40 acres and a mule&quot; promise featured prominently in the class action racial discrimination lawsuit of &quot;Pigford v. Glickman&quot;. In his opinion, federal judge Paul L. Friedman ruled that the United States Department of Agriculture had discriminated against African American farmers and wrote: &quot;Forty acres and a mule. The government broke that promise to African American farmers. Over one hundred years later, the USDA broke its promise to Mr. James Beverly.&quot;

In 1989, the U.S. congressional representative for Michigan John Conyers introduced a bill entitled Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act. The bill was later numbered as an allusion to the promise.

American rapper Kendrick Lamar has made use of the phrase multiple times throughout his career(To Pimp A Butterfly and Super Bowl LIX most notably) in reference to the failed promise of reconstruction.

===Reparations===
&quot;40 Acres and a Mule&quot; is often discussed in the context of reparations for slavery. However, strictly speaking, the various policies offering &quot;forty acres&quot; provided land for political and economic reasons—and with a price tag—and not as unconditional compensation for lifetimes of unpaid labor.

===Memorials===
A historical marker commemorating the order was erected by the Georgia Historical Society in Savannah, near the corner of Harris and Bull streets, in Madison Square.

<text>Samurai Pizza Cats is an American animated television show produced by Saban Entertainment. It is an adaptation of the anime series &quot;Kyatto Ninden Teyandee&quot; (&quot;Cat Ninja Legend Teyandee&quot;), produced by Tatsunoko Production and Sotsu Agency, which originally aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from February 1, 1990 to February 12, 1991 for a total of 54 episodes. Saban picked up the North American rights to the series in 1991 and produced a 52-episode English adaptation.

When Saban licensed the English version, proper translations of and information about the original Japanese episodes were either of poor quality or non-existent. It was decided to write completely original dialogue for the English dub, playing the show as a wacky comedy in contrast to the less farcical original. The English-language version became a cult hit among anime fans due to its rapid-fire pop-culture references and farcical nature.

Saban&#x27;s distribution rights to the series expired on November 12, 2000. Discotek Media currently holds the North American home video license to the series in North America, while Madman Entertainment holds the license for Australia and New Zealand.

Crunchyroll began streaming the series on December 27, 2015. The series became available for streaming to Amazon Prime subscribers in late 2018. In 2020, it became available on Tubi. In 2021, it became available on Peacock.

In February 2025, a video game adaption based on &quot;Samurai Pizza Cats&quot; was announced and is slated for a 2026 release.

==Plot==

The series is set in Little Tokyo, a mechanical city which fuses feudal Japanese culture with contemporary culture, and is populated by cybernetic anthropomorphic animals. The city is nominally led by Emperor Fred, a doddering eccentric. The city&#x27;s actual leadership lies in the hands of the city council and the emperor&#x27;s daughter, Princess Violet. The council is headed by ambitious Prime Minister Seymour &quot;The Big&quot; Cheese, a rat who constantly plots to overthrow the Emperor. Big Cheese is aided by his inept minions: trusted adviser Jerry Atric and Bad Bird, the leader of an army of ninja crows.

Unknown to the prime minister, council member and palace guard commander &quot;Big&quot; Al Dente has learned of his designs on leadership, but is unable to prosecute him for treason because of the plausible deniability he maintains. Instead, Al Dente enlists the services of Speedy Cerviche, Polly Esther, and Guido Anchovy, three cyborg cat samurai who work in the city&#x27;s pizzeria, along with their operator, Francine. Known collectively as the Samurai Pizza Cats, the three are assigned to stop Big Cheese and his evil henchmen&#x27;s plans to take over Little Tokyo.

==Characters==
==Production==
When Saban Entertainment licensed &quot;Kyatto Ninden Teyandee&quot;, 52 of the 54 episodes that were produced in Japan were translated into English. The two untranslated episodes were clip shows that did little to further the series&#x27; plot. Some episodes of the dubbed version were never aired in the United States, due to censorship issues.

The music in the English dub (replacing the original Japanese music) was by Shuki Levy and Haim Saban (credited as Kussa Mahchi). In keeping with the parodic nature of the show, the lyrics of the new theme song make a number of references to American pop culture. For example, the line &quot;they&#x27;ve got more fur than any turtle ever had&quot; references the similarly themed cartoon series &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, while the line &quot;they&#x27;re stronger than old cheese, stronger than dirt&quot; refers to an advertising slogan once used for the industrial cleaner Ajax. The theme song also contains the line &quot;As soon as someone finds the script, we might begin the show&quot;, a reference to the lack of proper translations given to Saban for production on the American version.

Michael Airington, a writer for the series, also sang the theme song (using a voice very similar to actor Paul Lynde), being credited as &quot;Singing Sensation: Googie Gomez&quot;. According to the producer Andy Thomas, Airington had a few drinks before the recording session for the song started, and as a result, accidentally stuttered on one line (&quot;this cat gets &quot;down down&quot; with a love hangover&quot;); that mistake was kept in the final version of the theme.

== Broadcast ==
The English version of the series first aired in the United Kingdom on ITV on August 31, 1991, with repeats continuing until 1995. In Canada, the series first appeared in 1992, on YTV, and in 1996, in the United States, on first-run syndication. The series was broadcast on Australian television on the weekday Seven Network morning kid&#x27;s wrapper programme &quot;Agro&#x27;s Cartoon Connection&quot;, from April 1992. A repeat run occurred in the same time slot in early 1994.

==Release==
Madman Entertainment released the show on DVD for Australia initially in two collections, with four discs in each set. Collection 1, containing episodes 1–26, was released on October 16, 2013; collection 2 containing episodes 27–52, was released on December 4, 2013. A box set of the complete series was released by Madman on April 6, 2016.

In 2012-13, Discotek Media announced the release of the show in both the original Japanese-language version and the North American English-language version dubbed by Saban. DVDs were released in region 1 format, with the Japanese version in Dolby Stereo 2.0 and English version in Dolby Digital Mono. The &quot;Kyatto-Ninden Teyandee: Complete Uncut Japanese Language Collection&quot; was released on April 30, 2013 and the English-dubbed version, &quot;Samurai Pizza Cats: Complete English Language TV Series Collection – 8 Disc Set&quot;, was released on July 30, 2013. The &quot;Kyatto-Ninden Teyandee: Complete Uncut Japanese Language Collection&quot; set includes all of the 54 original episodes (including the two clip-show episodes that were never dubbed into English) while the &quot;Samurai Pizza Cats: Complete English Language TV Series Collection&quot; set includes all 52 English-dubbed episodes. A French-language version, titled &quot;Samouraï Pizza Cats&quot;, which features a French dub adapted from the English dub, was released on DVD in France by Declic Images across two 5-disc box sets (26 episodes per set) in 2004.

A Blu-ray version, titled &quot;Samurai Pizza Cats: The Complete Collection&quot;, was released on January 19, 2016. This release featured every episode in standard definition on a single disk.

== Merchandise ==
Various toys and model kits were released in both Japan and Europe by Bandai, the latter usually being reboxed versions of the prior. Action figures for the Samurai Pizza Cats and the Rescue Team (the Japanese originals came as model kits comparable to today&#x27;s Gundam toys, while the European figures came pre-assembled). There were also both large and small (Gachapon-sized) rubber-like figures and playsets for the smaller figures, including the Great Catatonic and the pizza parlor.

In 1991, Tecmo published a platform video game based on &quot;Kyatto Ninden Teyandee&quot; for the Famicom (NES) in Japan. Although the game never officially was released in the West, an unofficial fan translation was made of the game, which also changes elements from the game to match that of the English dub, including character and place names.

The main characters of the series were also intended at one point to appear in the Wii fighting game &quot;Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars&quot;. The game&#x27;s producer, Ryota Niitsuma, was quoted in an interview as saying, &quot;One of the main anime we got more requests for than any others was &quot;Samurai Pizza Cats&quot;... I wanted to see that, but we couldn&#x27;t reach an agreement.&quot;

Speedy is also playable with Guido and Polly as supports in the arcade version of the game &quot;Jitsu Squad&quot; that was unveiled in Amusement Expo 2024 in Las Vegas.

&quot;Samurai Pizza Cats&quot; comics were released as back-up stories in &quot;Saban Powerhouse&quot; (published by Valiant/Acclaim) which ran for two issues in 1997.

An action role-playing video game, known as &quot;Samurai Pizza Cats: Blast from the Past!&quot;, is currently in development. Developed by Blast Zero and published by Red Dunes Games, the game is slated for a 2026 release on Windows and all major home consoles. Almost all of the show&#x27;s English and Japanese cast is set to reprise their roles, with the known exception of Guido Anchovy (Sukashi), who will be voiced by Seiichiro Yamashita in Japanese.

<text>The mangue bit or manguebeat movement is a cultural movement created circa 1991 in the city of Recife in Northeast Brazil in reaction to the cultural and economic stagnation of the city. The movement largely focuses on music, but it has its own fashion and slang, and encompasses aspects of visual art. It mixes regional rhythms of Brazilian Northeast, such as maracatu, frevo, coco and forró, with rock, soul, raggamuffin, hip hop, funk and electronic music.

==Overview==

The movement has its own manifesto, &quot;Caranguejos com Cérebro&quot; (or &quot;Crabs with Brains&quot; in English), written in 1991 by singer Fred 04 and DJ Renato L (Renato Lin). Its title refers to Recife&#x27;s inhabitants as crabs living in Recife&#x27;s mangrove environment. A major symbol associated with mangue bit is that of an antenna stuck in the mud receiving signals from all over the world.

&quot;Mangue bit&quot; can be divided into two distinct waves: the first in the early 1990s led by the music groups Chico Science &amp; Nação Zumbi (Zumbi&#x27;s Nation) and Mundo Livre S/A (Free World Inc.), and the second in the early 2000s led by Re:Combo (a copyleft movement that uploads half-sampled music for download) and Cordel do Fogo Encantado (a music group that started as a roving theatre troupe with roots in a form of literature known as &quot;literatura de cordel&quot; (&quot;twine literature&quot;)).

The original movement named itself &quot;mangue bit&quot;, &quot;mangue&quot; referring to Recife&#x27;s mangroves and &quot;bit&quot; to the computer bit central to the movement&#x27;s electronic music influences. Since then, mangue bit has commonly, albeit mistakenly, been referred as &quot;mangue beat&quot;.

== History ==

=== Origin ===

The basis for Mangue started towards the end of Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship at the beginning of the 1980s. The relaxation of censorship increased the availability of imported music, especially from the United States and the United Kingdom, leading to an increase of Brazilian-made rock music. In Recife, university students, including some of the founding characters of the movement, DJ Renato L. and Fred 04, started a radio show called &quot;Décadas&quot;, further facilitating the influence of rock music, especially underground music from England, leading to a large increase in Recife-based rock bands. Fred 04 notes that when Mundo Livre S/A began in 1984, poor economic circumstances and the lack of a music circuit in Recife, made it especially difficult for them, and similar music groups to find places to play. In the early 90s, Paulo Andre Pires, who would become Nação Zumbi&#x27;s impresario, began producing shows in Recife and invited both local and international bands to perform.

Despite being both being cited as founders for the Mangue movement, Chico Science and Nação Zumbi (CSNZ), and Mundo Livre S/A have different influences and backgrounds. Chico Science was born to a lower-middle-class family in the neighborhood of Rio Doce in the city of Olinda. His influences came from music he heard while attending baile funk parties as a youth and included early rap, hip-hop, rock and soul such as, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, Funkadelic, Sugar Hill Gang, Kurtis Blow, and Grand Master Flash. Having grown up being surrounded by regional folk music he also was heavily influenced by music of Recife such as maracatu, ciranda, embolada, and côco. Chico with his friend, Jorge du Peixe, joined several groups; Legião Hip Hop, Orla Orbe, and Loustal, before finding and meeting members of Lamento Negro, a bloco afro specializing in samba-reggae, in 1990 and forming what would be CSNZ.

Mundo Livre S/A was based in the neighborhood of Candeias, a wealthy area of Olinda. While the band members themselves weren&#x27;t wealthy, they were all firmly middle class as opposed to Chico Science and members of Nação Zumbi. Lead singer Fred 04, described the idea for the band as &quot;a fusion, a bridge between Johnny Rotten [of the punk band. the Sex Pistols] and Jorge Ben [a pioneering Brazilian pop musician who fuses funk. soul. and samba] and Moreira da Silva [a samba musician from the 1930s and &#x27;40s], understand? ... It would be a type of new wave but very Brazilian, really very Brazilian, that would be identified neither as rock nor as MPB [an acronym for Música Popular Brasileira, &quot;Brazilian Popular Music&quot;]&quot;.

When first hearing Chico Science in a mashup performance of Loustal and Lamento Negro, he thought the combination of the local/global juxtaposition, as well as the difference in geographical location, could launch what would become the Mangue movement into something that would highlight Recife&#x27;s diversity.

=== Manifesto Mangue ===
The Mangue manifesto, titled &quot;Caranguejos Com Cérebro&quot; (Crabs with Brains), was written by Fred 04 and Renato L. and distributed to the press in 1991. Though his name is not listed as an author when the manifesto was printed, Chico Science likely played a role in its creation. When naming Mangue, Chico Science initially used it solely to describe the fusion of genres and sounds used by Loustal and Lamento Negro. However, soon the word changed to describe more than the specific sound. DJ Renato L. describes Mangue as &quot;a label that we used for a type of cultural cooperative . . . that united some bands [particularly Nação Zumbi and Mundo Livre S/A], some visual artists, some journalists, some unemployed. And the idea, the label mangue emerged because Recife is a city that is constructed on top of the manguezais [&quot;mangrove swamps&quot;]. Our idea at the time [in the early ’90s] was to try to create a cultural scene here in Recife that was as rich and diversified as the mangue swamps, because the swamps are perhaps the ecosystem that has the greatest biodiversity of the planet. So the idea was to create a cultural scene . . . that had the same diversity, that wasn’t tied down to a single rhythm, a single style, or single fashion&quot;. That diversity is emphasized in the Mangue manifesto. It is divided into three parts: &quot;Mangue - the Concept&quot;, which talks about the biodiversity of the mangue swamps and its importance as an ecosystem to the people of Recife, &quot;Manguetown-The City&quot;, which describes a bit of Recife&#x27;s history and economic situation as being rated one of the worst cities in the world to live in, with a high rate of unemployment and a high rate of people living in slums, and &quot;Mangue-The Scene&quot;, which introduces the Mangue movement as a way to inject energy back into the city of Recife and connect it to the circulation of music on a global scale. The named symbol for the movement is &quot;a parabolic antenna put in the mud. Or a caranguejo [crab] remixing ANTHENA by Kraftwerk [a Euro-tech group] on the computer.&quot; The idea of the manifesto was to parallel the biodiversity of the mangue to the cultural diversity within Recife and to resuscitate the music and cultural scene, by mixing elements of globally circulating music with elements of regional music.
As a result of the manifesto being published, in 1992 MTV visited Recife to interview both Chico Science and Fred 04. The resulting footage played on MTV in Brazil, in January 1993, causing Mangue to gain traction in the south of Brazil. That same year, Paulo Andre Pires launched the first Abril pro Rock festival in Recife featuring CSNZ and Mundo Livre S/A as well as Nacão Pernambuco, a maracatu band that was gaining attention and growing quickly in popularity. The festival had a total audience of 1,500 people. CSNZ and Mundo Livre quickly found success in the music industry after the festival. Both bands toured in São Paulo and Minas Gerais and were picked up by record labels; CSNZ by Sony music, and Mundo Livre by Banguela, which was also the label that was producing music for band &quot;Titãs&quot;, and both bands produced their first CDs by 1994.

<text>An apparatchik () was a full-time, professional functionary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the Soviet government &quot;apparat&quot; (, apparatus), someone who held any position of bureaucratic or political responsibility, with the exception of the higher ranks of management called nomenklatura. James Billington describes an &quot;apparatchik&quot; as &quot;a man not of grand plans, but of a hundred carefully executed details.&quot; The term is often considered derogatory, with negative connotations in terms of the quality, competence, and attitude of a person thus described. 

Members of the apparat (&quot;apparatchiks&quot; or &quot;apparatchiki&quot;) were frequently transferred between different areas of responsibility, usually with little or no actual training for their new areas of responsibility. Thus, the term apparatchik, or &quot;agent of the apparatus&quot; was usually the best possible description of the person&#x27;s profession and occupation. Not all apparatchiks held lifelong positions. Many only entered such positions in middle age. They were known to receive various benefits including free holiday vouchers, free meals and accommodation. Today &quot;apparatchik&quot; is also used in contexts other than that of the Soviet Union or communist countries. According to &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; the word can mean &quot;an official or bureaucrat in any organization&quot;. According to Douglas Harper&#x27;s &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot;, the term was also used in the meaning &quot;Communist agent or spy&quot;, originating in the writings of Arthur Koestler,  1941.

<text>Ken Morse (born c. 1944) is a British rostrum camera operator who has provided visual effects to BBC television programmes over several decades.

Ken Morse worked as a cinema projectionist from the age of 12 for about 10 years.

Morse joined the film industry in the 1960s, working originally in stop motion animation before moving to the rostrum camera. The British Academy (BAFTA) presented him with a Lifetime Achievement award to recognise his contributions to the industry over nearly forty years. He is based in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London, England.

Morse has been mentioned in several British sketch shows: &quot;The Fast Show&quot; listed his name in a spoof set of credits; and &quot;Big Train&quot; included a sketch about a rostrum cameraman driven mad by always being overshadowed by Ken Morse. The one-off comedy special &quot;&quot; (produced by Armando Iannucci) credited &#x27;Rostrum Camera&#x27; to &quot;Not Ken Morse&quot;. He was also credited for &#x27;Rostrum Camera&#x27; in the spoof credits for &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, a sketch in the first series of &quot;Monkey Dust&quot;. At one stage the credit &quot;Rostrum Cameraman, Ken Morse,&quot; was even used on the spoken credits of the popular satirical BBC Radio show &quot;Week Ending&quot;.

<text>Lost in Space is a 1998 American science-fiction adventure film directed by Stephen Hopkins, and starring William Hurt, Matt LeBlanc, Gary Oldman, and Heather Graham. The plot is adapted from the 1965–1968 CBS television series of the same name (itself inspired by the 1812 novel &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; by Johann David Wyss). Several actors from the TV show make cameo appearances.

The film focuses on the Robinson family, who undertake a voyage to a nearby star system to begin large-scale emigration from a soon-to-be uninhabitable Earth, but are thrown off course by a saboteur and must try to find their way home.

&quot;Lost in Space&quot; received negative reviews from critics, and grossed $136.2 million worldwide with an $80 million budget.

==Plot==

In 2058, Earth will soon be uninhabitable due to the irreversible effects of pollution and ozone depletion. In an effort to save humanity, the United Global Space Force sends Professor John Robinson, his wife Maureen, daughters Judy and Penny, and young prodigy son Will on the spaceship &quot;Jupiter II&quot; to complete construction of a hypergate over the planet Alpha Prime, which will allow the population of Earth to be instantly transported and populate the new planet. Penny rebels by breaking curfew, while Will&#x27;s prize-winning science experiment involving time travel goes largely unnoticed by John. Global Sedition, a mutant terrorist group, assassinates the &quot;Jupiter II&quot;&#x27;s pilot, who is replaced by hotshot fighter pilot Major Don West, to his chagrin.

The family&#x27;s physician Dr. Zachary Smith, a Sedition spy, sabotages the ship&#x27;s on-board robot before launch, but is betrayed by his cohorts and left unconscious as the ship launches and the family enters cryosleep. The robot activates and begins to destroy the navigation and guidance systems, en route to destroying the family. Smith awakens the Robinsons and West, who subdue the robot, but the ship is falling uncontrollably into the Sun. Forced to use the experimental hyperdrive with an unplotted course, the ship is transported through hyperspace to a remote planet in an uncharted part of the universe.

Passing through a strange distortion in space, the crew finds two abandoned ships in orbit: the Earth ship &quot;Proteus&quot;, and another ship clearly not of human origin. They board the &quot;Proteus&quot;, with Will controlling the now-modified robot. They find navigational data to reach Alpha Prime, and a camouflaging creature Penny calls &quot;Blarp&quot;, along with evidence suggesting the ship is from the future. They are attacked by spider-like creatures; one scratches Smith, and the robot&#x27;s body is irreparably damaged but Will saves its computerized intelligence.

West destroys the vessel to eradicate the spiders, causing the ship to crash-land on the nearby planet, where another distortion appears. Will theorizes they are distortions in time, as his experiment predicted, but John ignores his input. Exploring the time bubble, he and West encounter a future version of Will and a robot he rebuilt with the saved intelligence. The older Will explains that surviving spiders killed Maureen, Penny, and Judy. Constructing a time machine, the future Will intends to return to Earth to prevent &quot;Jupiter II&quot; from launching.

Young Will and Smith investigate the time bubble on their own. Smith tricks Will into handing over his weapon, but is foiled by a future version of himself, transformed by his spider injury into a spider-like creature, who has been protecting Will since the rest of the family was killed. The present Will and West return to the &quot;Jupiter II&quot; with an injured Smith and the robot in tow, while the future Smith reveals his true plan: He killed the Robinsons, but kept Will alive to build the time machine, so Smith could return to Earth and populate it with a race of spiders.

John, remembering that spiders eat their wounded, rips open Smith&#x27;s egg sac with a trophy Will turned into a weapon. Smith&#x27;s spider army devours him and he is thrown into the time portal, ripping him apart. The planet&#x27;s increasing instability forces the &quot;Jupiter II&quot; to take off, but they are unable to reach escape velocity and are destroyed by the planet&#x27;s debris. Realizing his father never actually abandoned them, Will sets the time machine to send John back to his family, but there is only enough power for one person. Saying goodbye to his family, the future Will is killed by falling debris, and John reunites with his living family.

Realizing they do not have enough power to escape the planet&#x27;s gravitational pull, John suggests they drive the ship down through the planet, using the gravity well to slingshot them back into space. They are successful, but the planet turns into a black hole, and they activate the hyperdrive to escape. Using the &quot;Proteus&quot;’ navigational data to set a potential course for Alpha Prime, the ship blasts off into hyperspace.

==Production==
Filming began on March 3, 1997, in London&#x27;s Shepperton Studios, with more than 700 visual effects shots planned, done by Computer Film Company, The Mill, Cinesite and Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop, among other visual effects vendors. The $70 million &quot;Lost in Space&quot; film was New Line&#x27;s hope to launch a multimedia franchise, followed by animated and live-action television series. Licensing deals were made with Trendmasters for toys and Harper Prism and Scholastic for tie-in novels.

==Music==
TVT Records released a soundtrack album on March 31, 1998, featuring 11 tracks of Bruce Broughton&#x27;s original score (which makes no reference to either of the TV themes composed by John Williams) and eight tracks of electronic techno music (most of which is heard only over the film&#x27;s end credits). A European version of the soundtrack album was released that omits the tracks &quot;Spider Attack&quot;, &quot;Jupiter Crashes&quot;, and &quot;Spider Smith&quot;, and instead includes three new songs unused in the film (&quot;Aah-Yah&quot; by O.P. Phoenix, &quot;Asphalt Ostrich&quot; by HeadCrash, and &quot;Anarchy&quot; by KMFDM). Intrada Records released a score album for the film the following year, and the complete score in 2016. The track &quot;Thru the Planet&quot; on the TVT album is not the same as &quot;Through the Planet&quot; on the Intrada release, but is a shortened version of Broughton&#x27;s unused end-title music heard on the score album as &quot;Lost in Space.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
On its opening weekend, &quot;Lost in Space&quot; grossed $20,154,919 and debuted at number one at the US box office, ending &quot;Titanic&quot;″s 15-week-long hold on the first-place position. It opened in a record 3,306 theaters and grossed an average of $6,096 per screening. &quot;Lost in Space&quot; grossed $69,117,629 in the United States and Canada, and $67,041,794 internationally, bringing its worldwide total to $136,159,423.

===Critical response===
&quot;Lost in Space&quot; received negative reviews from critics upon release. Roger Ebert gave the film a rating of one and a half out of four, calling it a &quot;dim-witted shoot-&#x27;em-up&quot;. Wade Major of &quot;BoxOffice&quot; rated the film at 1 and a half out of 5, calling it &quot;the dumbest and least imaginative adaptation of a television series yet translated to the screen.&quot; James Berardinelli was slightly more favorable, giving the film a rating of 2 and a half out of 4. While praising the film&#x27;s set design, he criticized its &quot;meandering storyline and lifeless protagonists&quot;, saying that &quot;&quot;Lost in Space&quot; features a few action sequences that generate adrenaline jolts, but this is not an edge-of-the-seat motion picture.&quot;

Online aggregators have tracked both contemporary and recent reviews of &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. At Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 27% based on 84 appraisals, with an average score of 4.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Clumsily directed and missing most of the TV series&#x27; campy charm, &quot;Lost in Space&quot; sadly lives down to its title.&quot; The film holds a score of 42 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on the opinions of 19 journalists, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Accolades===
&quot;Lost in Space&quot; received six Saturn Award nominations, including Best Supporting Actor for Oldman. The film also received a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Remake or Sequel, but lost to the tied &quot;Godzilla&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Psycho&quot;.

At the 1998 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film won Worst Supporting Actress for Chabert and was nominated for four other awards: Worst Song in a Movie for &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (lost to &quot;Come with Me&quot;), Worst Resurrection of a TV Show (lost to &quot;The Avengers&quot;), Worst Director for Hopkins (lost to Jeremiah Chechik for &quot;The Avengers&quot;), and Worst Picture (lost to &quot;Spice World&quot;).

==Home media==
VHS, DVD, and later a Blu-ray have been released for the film. Both the DVD and Blu-ray releases contain deleted scenes.

<doc id="565321" wikidata="Q5273586" url="?curid=565321" title="Dick &amp; Dom in da Bungalow">
<text>Dick &amp; Dom in da Bungalow is a British children&#x27;s television series presented by the duo Dick and Dom (Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood). The series was broadcast on weekend mornings for five series on the CBBC Channel, BBC One and BBC Two, running between 31 August 2002 and 11 March 2006.

==Creation==
McCourt and Wood met whilst presenting CBBC&#x27;s in vision links from Studio TC9 at BBC Television Centre in West London, and were invited to create a new Saturday morning show to air on CBBC&#x27;s new digital channel after establishing themselves as a double act. The name &quot;in da Bungalow&quot; was suggested by the BBC as a parody of &quot;Ali G Indahouse&quot;, and aired directly against &quot;SM:TV Live&quot; with H and Claire from Steps, and &quot;The Saturday Show&quot; on BBC One with Fearne Cotton and Simon Grant. After six months, &quot;da Bungalow&quot; had half a million viewers and moved to BBC One in 2003.

==Show format==
Much of the programme revolved around a loose game show format involving six studio contestants (or &quot;Bungalow Heads&quot;). These were all children in Series 1–4, whilst in Series 5, five children and one celebrity were the contestants on the Saturday show, and five children and a special guest ranging from family members / friends, or the cast of the show in various outfits (such as Darth Vader, or Mr. Blobby) were contestants on the Sunday show. Points were earned through success in various games throughout the show, although points could be awarded or taken away at any time by the hosts. Although they threatened to do this, for example, when a particular child was being troublesome, this was mostly never carried out.

The first and second prizes were usually desirable items such as a TV or games console, but the third prize was always a &#x27;booby prize&#x27; like a hubcap, a cake made of carpet, a hairy cheese, bottled water from the River Hull or a chocolate tea pot. At the very end, the Bungalow Head with the fewest points was gunged, sitting on the toilet - though for the last series this practice was largely dropped, possibly because the contestants were already covered in &quot;creamy muck muck&quot; (custard) during the finale round.

The show&#x27;s games were interspersed with random features and cartoons.

During Series 1 to 4, the points total at the end of Saturday - with an extra prize for the winner on Saturday - was carried over to the Sunday show, and prizes were awarded at the end of that show.

===Recurring features===
====Bogies====
The most infamous part of &quot;Dick and Dom in da Bungalow&quot; was a pre-recorded game called Bogies. In this game, Dick and Dom situated themselves in a quiet public place such as a museum or restaurant and took turns to shout &quot;bogies&quot; at gradually increasing volumes, until one of them did not shout as loud as the other (judged by a meter on the screen), or quit due to embarrassment.

The commentary for Bogies was provided by the show&#x27;s producer, Steve Ryde.

====Diddy Dick and Dom====
Diddy Dick and Dom was a segment in which miniature versions of Dick and Dom (in reality, puppets attached to a black cloak) presented a mini sketch during an intermission of the show. The location for these sketches was in a purple cupboard, and away from the attention of Dick, Dom and the Bungalow Heads, the doors would open to show the duo. These were pre-recorded, and no more than a minute in length. Both Diddy Dick and Diddy Dom spoke with very squeaky voices, edited in post production. The sketches involving Diddy Dick and Diddy Dom tended to be either slapstick humour, puns or, more often than not, toilet humour.

In 2007, a series of 3-4 minute compilations of the sketches were made and shown on CBBC.

====Cartoons====
Every episode would have anywhere up to two to three cartoons shown throughout the show, including but not limited to the following.

* &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;
* &quot;Batfink&quot;
* &quot;Yvon of the Yukon&quot;
* &quot;Tom and Jerry Kids&quot;
* &quot;Watch My Chops&quot;
* &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;
* &quot;The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show&quot;
* &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;
* &quot;The Cramp Twins&quot;
* &quot;BB3B&quot;
* &quot;Zombie Hotel&quot;
==Controversies==
The BBC upheld a complaint in August 2004 against Wood and McCourt appearing nearly naked in promotions for the show on the CBBC Channel, deeming the material as beyond acceptable standards.

In September 2004, Ofcom said that the show breached children&#x27;s programming regulations when Dominic Wood wore a t-shirt with the wording &quot;Morning Wood&quot;, a slang term for erections. He said that it was merely a reference to the morning timeslot and his surname. The BBC said that its producers made an error in not objecting to the shirt.

Peter Luff, a Conservative MP, attacked the programme and its website for scatological content and criticised the role of the BBC as a public broadcaster of such content. The BBC responded that the show was entertainment for children 8-12 and was well-liked by that demographic, but may not appeal to adults. Luff&#x27;s comments were subsequently parodied on the show in a segment titled &#x27;Question Muck&#x27;, inspired by the long running topical debate programme &quot;Question Time&quot; based in the UK, where their panel of fake guests included a ball of fluff called &#x27;Rt Hon. Pieceof Fluff MP&#x27;.

==Transmissions==
===&quot;No celebrities allowed&quot; rule===
The main rule of &quot;da Bungalow&quot; for most of its run was that there were no celebrities allowed, except for Comic Relief and the final series. A running gag through the early seasons of the show featured a minor, and often somewhat cult, celebrity, locked in a cage in the dungeon of the Bungalow. In later series, the celebrity would be found in the attic. In both cases, they would normally be silent. Some people who have been in the cage or the attic included Vince Earl, Sarah Greene, John Kettley, Hugo Myatt (as Treguard from ITV&#x27;s &quot;Knightmare&quot;), Su Pollard, Bodger and Badger and Peter Simon.

For the final series, however, this rule was changed, and five Bungalow Heads were joined by a Celebrity Bungalow Head. The first celebrity to enter the Bungalow was Rachel Stevens, who refused to take part in the show&#x27;s Creamy Muck Muck finale, &quot;Splativersity Challenge&quot;. Reports at the time suggested that the presenters have banned Stevens from any live broadcast they do in the future.

==Accolades==
==Spin-offs==
===Diddy Dick and Dom on CBBC===
Short five-minute compilations of the Diddy Dick and Dom sketches were aired as filler programmes on BBC Two and the CBBC Channel after the programme&#x27;s end.

===Da Dick and Dom Dairies===

A new series of compilations began airing during weekday mornings on BBC2 from Monday 26 January to Friday 20 February 2009, featuring newly recorded material from the original cast and the creamy muck muck finale towards the end of each episode. Regular segments included:
* Game or No Game in which Little Noely (a parody of Noel Edmonds played by Ian Kirkby, who appeared in the Bungalow on two occasions) presents a parody of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; in order to determine whether or not a game will be shown or not. Little Noely invited viewers to pick one of two boxes. We are led to believe that if the &quot;No Game&quot; box is picked the show will end. If the &quot;Game&quot; box is picked the name of the game shown in the box is played.
* Good Game Good Game Gamey Game Game in which parodies of Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly pick random cards each enlisting a game until a pair is found. The game which is the subject of the pair is subsequently shown, after &quot;Bruce&quot; says &quot;What do we do with a pair?&quot; and &quot;Tess&quot; says something like &quot;Eat it!&quot; (referring to the fruit). For some reason in this feature, Tess Daly is just a mini spinning cardboard cut out which talks with a gruff northern accent.
* Batt Files in which Harry Batt interrogates former Bungalow Heads and relives classic Bungalow moments. The Prize Idiot also features who we are now told is a Police Constable working for DI Batt.
* Good Bungalows Go Bad - Melvin O Doom features in a sketch in which he relives some of his personal favourite Bungalow moments.

Notice the deliberate spelling mistake in the title (Dairies-Diaries), which is pointed out in the final episode of &quot;Da Dick and Dom Dairies&quot;.

===Diddy TV===

In 2016, another new series aired on CBBC which was a sketch show featuring parodies of various other programmes. It ran for four seasons.

==Future &amp; 20th Anniversary Tour==
In 2016, producer Steve Ryde has stated that there may be a one-off special in the future.

On 14 November 2019, Dick and Dom ran a poll on Twitter asking if viewers would be interested to see a revival of the show, except with adults as contestants.

===Tour===

On 26 January 2022, Dick and Dom posted an image of one of the Bungalow&#x27;s wallpapers on Instagram, with no context. Social media users theorized that this could signify a reboot. On 3 May 2022, Dick and Dom posted on their social media pages a video of the &quot;Bungalow&quot; house logo with the number 5 next to it and with Dick&#x27;s voice shouting bogies. Over the next few hours, other videos were posted to create a countdown. On 4 May 2022, it was announced that &quot;Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow&quot; would be returning as a tour in Autumn 2022 to mark the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The tour was delayed to 2023 with added venues across the UK. The tour officially commenced on 11 March 2023 in the Birmingham Town Hall, exactly 17 years to the day since the final episode. When asked in an interview about this, Dick &amp; Dom had not realised this and were pleasantly surprised.

<text> (&quot;Songs on the Death of Children&quot;) is a song cycle (1904) for voice and orchestra by Gustav Mahler. The words of the songs are poems by Friedrich Rückert.

==Poems and setting==

The original were a group of 428 poems written by Rückert in 1833–34 in an outpouring of grief following the illness (scarlet fever) and death of two of his children. Karen Painter describes the poems thus: &quot;Rückert&#x27;s 428 poems on the death of children became singular, almost manic documents of the psychological endeavor to cope with such loss. In ever new variations Rückert&#x27;s poems attempt a poetic resuscitation of the children that is punctuated by anguished outbursts. But above all the poems show a quiet acquiescence to fate and to a peaceful world of solace.&quot; These poems were not intended for publication, and they appeared in print only in 1871, five years after the poet&#x27;s death.

Mahler selected five of Rückert&#x27;s poems to set as Lieder, which he composed between 1901 and 1904. The songs are written in Mahler&#x27;s late-romantic idiom, and like the texts reflect a mixture of feelings: anguish, fantasy resuscitation of the children, resignation. The final song ends in a major key and a mood of transcendence.

The cello melody in the postlude to &quot;&quot; (mm. 129–133) alludes to the first subject of the finale of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 (1895/96), a movement titled &quot;What love tells me&quot; (&quot;&quot;). &quot;Musically, then, this is the last word of the : that death is powerful, yet love is even stronger.&quot;

==The &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; and Mahler&#x27;s life history==
At the time he wrote the work, Mahler was no stranger to the deaths of children. Hefling writes: &quot;Such tragedy was familiar to Mahler, eight of his siblings died during their childhood. Among all of them, the death of his closest younger brother Ernst in 1875 had affected him most deeply, and he confided to [his friend] Natalie [Bauer-Lechner] that &#x27;such frightful sorrow he had never again experienced, as great a loss he had nevermore borne&#x27;.&quot;

Mahler resumed the composition of the interrupted work (see above) in 1904, only two weeks after the birth of his own second child; this upset his wife Alma, who &quot;found it incomprehensible and feared Mahler was tempting Providence.&quot;

Alma&#x27;s fears proved all too prescient, for three years after the work had been completed the Mahlers&#x27; daughter Maria died of scarlet fever, aged four. Mahler wrote to Guido Adler: &quot;I placed myself in the situation that a child of mine had died. When I really lost my daughter, I could not have written these songs any more.&quot;

==Composition and premiere==
Stephen Hefling indicates that Mahler composed the first, third, and fourth songs in 1901 (he played them for his friend Natalie Bauer-Lechner on 10 August). There followed a long break, and the remaining songs were composed in the summer of 1904.

The work was premiered in Vienna on 29 January 1905. Friedrich Weidemann, a leading baritone at the Vienna Court Opera, was the soloist, and the composer conducted. The hall was selected as a relatively small one, compatible with the intimacy of the &quot;lied&quot; genre, and the orchestra was a chamber orchestra consisting of players drawn from the Vienna Philharmonic. 
== Scoring and performance ==
The work is scored for a vocal soloist (the notes lie comfortably for a baritone or mezzo-soprano) and an orchestra consisting of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais (English horn), 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, timpani, glockenspiel, tam-tam, celesta, harp, and strings. Deployed at chamber-orchestra scale, this instrumentation permitted Mahler to explore a wide variety of timbres within a smaller-scale sound; Tunbridge sees this as a new precedent adopted by later composers, for example Schoenberg in &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;.

Concerning the performance of the work, the composer wrote &quot;these five songs are intended as one inseparate unit, and in performing them their continuity should not be interfered with&quot;.

The work takes about 25 minutes to perform.

==Text==
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;
&quot;Nun will die Sonn&#x27; so hell aufgeh&#x27;n&quot; (D minor)
Nun will die Sonn&#x27; so hell aufgeh&#x27;n
als sei kein Unglück die Nacht gescheh&#x27;n.
Das Unglück geschah nur mir allein.
Die Sonne, sie scheinet allgemein.

Du mußt nicht die Nacht in dir verschränken
mußt sie ins ew&#x27;ge Licht versenken.
Ein Lämplein verlosch in meinem Zelt,
Heil sei dem Freudenlicht der Welt.

&quot;Nun seh&#x27; ich wohl, warum so dunkle Flammen&quot; (C minor)
Nun seh&#x27; ich wohl, warum so dunkle Flammen
ihr sprühtet mir in manchem Augenblicke.
O Augen, gleichsam, um in einem Blicke
zu drängen eure ganze Macht zusammen.

Doch ahnt&#x27; ich nicht, weil Nebel mich umschwammen,
gewoben vom verblendenden Geschicke,
daß sich der Strahl bereits zur Heimkehr schicke,
dorthin, von wannen alle Strahlen stammen.

Ihr wolltet mir mit eurem Leuchten sagen:
Wir möchten nah dir immer bleiben gerne!
Doch ist uns das vom Schicksal abgeschlagen.

Sieh&#x27; recht uns an, denn bald sind wir dir ferne!
Was dir noch Augen sind in diesen Tagen:
In künft&#x27;gen Nächten sind es dir nur Sterne.

&quot;Wenn dein Mütterlein&quot; (C minor)
Wenn dein Mütterlein
tritt zur Tür herein,
und den Kopf ich drehe,
ihr entgegen sehe,
fällt auf ihr Gesicht
erst der Blick mir nicht,
sondern auf die Stelle,
näher nach der Schwelle,
dort, wo würde dein
lieb Gesichtchen sein.
Wenn du freudenhelle
trätest mit herein,
wie sonst, mein Töchterlein.

Wenn dein Mütterlein
tritt zur Tür herein,
mit der Kerze Schimmer,
ist es mir, als immer
kämst du mit herein,
huschtest hinterdrein,
als wie sonst ins Zimmer!
O du, des Vaters Zelle,
ach, zu schnell
erlosch&#x27;ner Freudenschein!

&quot;Oft denk&#x27; ich, sie sind nur ausgegangen&quot; (E-flat major)
Oft denk&#x27; ich, sie sind nur ausgegangen,
bald werden sie wieder nach Hause gelangen.
Der Tag ist schön, o sei nicht bang,
sie machen nur einen weiten Gang.

Ja wohl, sie sind nur ausgegangen,
und werden jetzt nach Hause gelangen.
O, sei nicht bang, der Tag ist schön,
sie machen einen Gang zu jenen Höh&#x27;n.

Sie sind uns nur voraus gegangen,
und werden nicht wieder nach Hause verlangen.
Wir holen sie ein auf jenen Höh&#x27;n
im Sonnenschein, der Tag ist schön,
auf jenen Höh&#x27;n.

&quot;In diesem Wetter&quot; (D minor–D major)
In diesem Wetter, in diesem Braus,
nie hätt&#x27; ich gesendet die Kinder hinaus;
man hat sie getragen hinaus,
ich durfte nichts dazu sagen!

In diesem Wetter, in diesem Saus,
nie hätt&#x27; ich gelassen die Kinder hinaus;
ich fürchtete sie erkranken,
das sind nun eitle Gedanken.

In diesem Wetter, in diesem Graus,
Nie hätt&#x27; ich gelassen die Kinder hinaus;
ich sorgte, sie stürben morgen,
das ist nun nicht zu besorgen.

In diesem Wetter, in diesem Graus!
Nie hätt&#x27; ich gesendet die Kinder hinaus!
Man hat sie hinaus getragen,
ich durfte nichts dazu sagen!

In diesem Wetter, in diesem Saus, in diesem Braus,
sie ruh&#x27;n als wie in der Mutter Haus,
von keinem Sturm erschrecket,
von Gottes Hand bedecket.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:1em; float:left;&quot;&gt;&quot;Now the sun wants to rise as brightly&quot;
Now the sun wants to rise as brightly
As if nothing terrible had happened during the night.
The misfortune happened only to me,
But the sun shines equally on everyone.

You must not fold the night into yourself.
You must bathe it in eternal light.
A little lamp has gone out in my tent.
I must greet the joyful light of the world.

&quot;Now I see why with such dark flames&quot;
Now I see why with such dark flames
Your eyes flash at me in certain moments.
O eyes, it was as if in a single glance
You could concentrate your full power.

Yet I didn&#x27;t realize, because mists were floating around me,
Woven by a blinding fate,
That your beam of light was ready to be sent home,
To the place from which all beams emanate.

You wanted to tell me with your light:
We really want to stay near you forever!
But that was taken away by fate.

Look straight at us, because soon we will be far away!
What to you are only eyes in these days,
In the nights to come will be only stars.

&quot;When your mama&quot;
When your mama
steps in through the door
and I turn my head
to see her,
on her face
my gaze does not first fall,
but at the place
nearer the doorstep,
there, where your
dear little face would be,
when you with bright joy
would step inside,
as you used to, my little daughter.

When your mama
steps in through the door
with the glowing candle,
it seems to me, as if you always
came in with her too,
hurrying behind her,
as you used to come into the room.
Oh you, of a father&#x27;s cell,
ah, too soon
extinguished joyful light!

&quot;I often think that they have just stepped out&quot;
I often think that they have just stepped out
And that they will be coming home soon.
The day is fine, don&#x27;t be worried,
They&#x27;ve just gone for a long walk.

Yes indeed, they have just stepped out,
And now they are making their way home.
Don&#x27;t be worried, the day is fine.
They have simply made a journey to those hills.

They have just gone out ahead of us,
And they will not be coming home again.
We&#x27;ll go meet them on those hills,
In the sunlight, the day is fine
On those hills.

&quot;In this weather&quot;
In this weather, in this windy storm,
I would never have sent the children out.
They have been carried off,
I wasn&#x27;t able to warn them!

In this weather, in this gale,
I would never have let the children out.
I feared they sickened:
those thoughts are now in vain.

In this weather, in this storm,
I would never have let the children out,
I was anxious they might die the next day:
now anxiety is pointless.

In this weather, in this windy storm,
I would never have sent the children out.
They have been carried off,
I wasn&#x27;t able to warn them!

In this weather, in this gale, in this windy storm,
they rest as if in their mother&#x27;s house:
frightened by no storm,
sheltered by the Hand of God.&lt;/poem&gt;
