<text>The  (&quot;External Documentation and Counter-Espionage Service&quot;), abbreviated SDECE (), was France&#x27;s external intelligence agency from 6 November 1944 to 2 April 1982, when it was replaced by the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE). It should not be confused with the Deuxième Bureau which was intended to pursue purely military intelligence.

Under the Fourth Republic the SDECE was subordinated to the President of the Council. From the onset of the Fifth Republic and until 1962, it was subordinate to Prime Minister Michel Debré and its resources largely dedicated to the Algerian War. Following the Mehdi Ben Barka affair, General Charles de Gaulle subordinated the service to the Ministry of Defence, and the service was gradually militarized.

==History==
The SDECE was founded in 1946 as a successor to the wartime Bureau Central de Renseignements et d&#x27;Action which was seen as too closely associated with the Gaullists to properly serve the republic. SDECE was known in France as &quot;la piscine&quot; (the swimming pool) because its HQ in Paris was located next to a public swimming pool. The SDECE was officially responsible to the Minister of Defense, but in fact reported to the president acting through a special adviser on intelligence matters. The SDECE was frequently involved in bureaucratic disputes with the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; in Vietnam and Algeria, and within France with the &quot;Sûreté Générale&quot;, which led successive directors of the SDECE to see their real enemies as the other branches of the republic concerned with intelligence. As was usually the case with French intelligence, the division of responsibilities between rival agencies led to different arms of the French state to spend more time locked in bureaucratic disputes with one another than anything else. In September 1949, SDECE played a prominent role in the &quot;scandal of the generals&quot;, when the &quot;Sûreté Générale&quot; revealed that the Army chief of staff had trusted confidential documents relating to the war in Vietnam to another general, who had given them to an SDECE agent who in turn had given them to the Vietminh. The French state tried to bury the story by ordering the newspapers not to print it, but the Paris correspondent of &quot;Time&quot; had reported to the New York office of &quot;Time&quot;. Unknown to him, the French state was illegally listening in to dispatches filed by foreign correspondents from Paris. The French embassy in Washington tried to suppress the story as embarrassing to France, but the U.S. government refused, citing the First Amendment, leading to the scandal of the Generals&#x27; affair as once the news broke in the United States, it was picked up by the French media.

In the 1950s, SDECE had a reputation for engaging in bizarre operations like stealing fuel from Soviet planes that had landed in France to analyze the antifreeze contents of Soviet jet fuel and for drugging Soviet espionage couriers on the Orient Express to rifle through the contents of their briefcases. The cryptographic division of the SDECE was well regarded, having broken several Soviet diplomatic codes, but its attempts at playing the role of a para-military organization was less successful. In 1951 SDECE created the Groupement de Commandos Mixtes Aéroportés para-military organization in Vietnam, part of the &quot;Action Service&quot; (together with 11th shock parachute regiment), to counter the Vietminh who were fighting for independence from France, but the general hostility of the Vietnamese to the French limited the appeal of fighting for France among the Vietnamese people. The SDECE parachuted agents both in Vietnam and Eastern Europe, but the SDECE was well penetrated by French communists who provided Moscow with all the details of the operations. In particular, the operations in Eastern Europe in 1950s were a complete disaster as every single agent parachuted into Eastern Europe was captured.

As in Vietnam, during the Algerian War, the SDECE played a prominent role in waging &quot;la guerre sale&quot; (&quot;the dirty war&quot;) against the enemies of the republic. The 1950s-60s are remembered as the &quot;era of political assassinations&quot; by SDECE agents as one of the agency&#x27;s main jobs was to assassinate members of the FLN. The number of killings dramatically stepped up in 1958 when Charles de Gaulle gave the SDECE&#x27;s Action Service &quot;carte blanche&quot; to kill suspected members of the FLN under the cover of a pseudo-terrorist group called the Red Hand. The first two murders took place in West Germany, where an arms dealer who sold arms to the FLN was killed when the SDECE planted a bomb in his car while an anti-French Algerian politician was killed in a drive-by shooting. The fact that the various &quot;Länder&quot; police forces of West Germany were ineffective in investigating the &quot;Red Hand&quot; assassinations committed by SDECE was the result of a secret agreement with General Reinhard Gehlen, the chief of the &quot;Bundesnachrichtendienst&quot; under which the French and German intelligence were to share information in exchange for allowing the SDECE to commit murders on German soil. One SDECE agent, Philippe L. Thyraud de Vosjoli, wrote in his 1970 memoir &quot;Lamia&quot;: &quot;Dozens of assassinations were carried out. Besides the use of guns or knives, more sophisticated methods had been perfected. Carbon dioxide guns ejecting small syringes had been purchased in the United States-but the SDECE people substituted the tranquilizing drug with a lethal poison. The victim showed all the symptoms of having suffered a heart attack&quot;. Besides for members of the FLN, the SDECE killed left-wing French intellectuals who supported the FLN, arms dealers and other anti-French nationalists in Africa. The SDECE also engaged in hijacking six ships bound for Algeria with arms for the FLN between 1956–61, and blew up one ship packed with weapons for the FLN in Hamburg harbor with a naval mine. Within Algeria itself, the SDECE assassinated suspected FLN members and provided intelligence to the Army to indicate &quot;disloyal&quot; villages that were to be burned down. Many of the assassins were pro-French Vietnamese who fled to France after Vietnamese independence, and were quite willing to kill and/or be killed for France. In 1960, many of the Action Service&#x27;s killers, including most of the Vietnamese, went over the OAS, leading to the Action Service to dispatch new agents to Algeria to assassinate the former Action Service assassins who joined the OAS. In January 1961, the Action Service blew up the headquarters of the OAS&#x27;s assassins. In 1960, de Gaulle founded the Service d&#x27;Action Civique (SAC), an organization linked to SDECE of about 8,000 that spied on his political opponents, broke up anti-Gaullist demonstrations and engaged in &quot;dirty tricks&quot; for the SDECE.

In December 1961, the SDECE was rocked by scandal of the Martel affair (also known as the Sapphire Affair) when a KGB defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn revealed to the CIA the existence of the Soviet Sapphire spy ring within the SDECE. President John F. Kennedy wrote a letter to President de Gaulle, detailing Golitsyn’s revelations, which was handed to de Gaulle personally by the CIA station chief in Paris. De Gaulle, however, believed the claim that the Sapphire spy ring existed was a CIA plot to disorganize the SDECE, and ordered the SDECE to break off all co-operation with the CIA. James Jesus Angleton, the CIA counterintelligence chief, seeing no French reaction to Golityn&#x27;s information, ordered a &quot;Black Bag job&quot; (a break-in) at the French embassy in Washington to photograph the codebooks that were used to encrypt the Quai d&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s radio messages, thereby allowing the Americans to know what the French were doing and to monitor the French reaction to Golitsyn’s revelations (the NSA apparently was not capable of breaking the Quai d&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s codes in the 1960s). When it was discovered the CIA had broken into the French embassy to steal the French diplomatic codes, the SDECE station chief in Washington was recalled to Paris in disgrace. Despite de Gaulle&#x27;s belief that the KGB Sapphire spy ring was CIA disinformation, it was later discovered that the Sapphire spy ring did in fact exist, and that Georges Pâques, the NATO press secretary, and , an aviation scientist, were both working for the KGB. Pâques was convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union, receiving life in prison, which was later reduced down to 20 years in prison. The Sapphire affair inspired the American novelist Leon Uris to write the 1967 novel &quot;Topaz&quot; about the Soviet penetration of the SDECE via the &quot;Topaz&quot; spy ring, which so closely resembled the Sapphire affair that many suspected the CIA leaked Uris information about the Sapphire case. 
In October 1965, the SDECE was involved in another scandal when two SDECE agents kidnapped Mehdi Ben Barka, a left-wing Moroccan émigré, on the streets of Paris and handed him over to the agents of the Moroccan government to be tortured and killed. King Hassan II of Morocco, a close ally of France, had long been annoyed at Ben Barka&#x27;s criticism of his regime and had asked General de Gaulle to extradite him back to Morocco, but as Ben Barka had been granted asylum in France and was breaking no laws, it was not legally possible to return Ben Barka to Morocco, leading to alternative means to be deployed. Ben Barka&#x27;s body was never found, but as he was last seen alive in Paris being handed over by two SDECE agents to Moroccan agents on 29 October 1965, he is generally believed to have been murdered by the Moroccans. The revelation that the gangsters from &quot;le milieu&quot; (literally &quot;the middle&quot;; i.e French organized crime) had also involved in kidnapping Ben Barka further added to the scandal as many French people were shocked to discover that the SDECE often co-operated with &quot;le milieu&quot;. The Ben Barka affair briefly caused much public excitement as the SDECE had no powers of arrest, let alone to hand over a man who was legally living in France to be killed by the Moroccan state, but as the victim was a Moroccan Muslim, the public outrage soon subsided over &quot;L&#x27;affaire Ben Barka&quot;, and the scandal ended when the two SDECE agents who helped kidnap Ben Barka were convicted in 1967.

===Quebec separatism===
A major area of SDECE activity in the 1960s was supporting the Quebec separatist movement. Jacques Foccart, one of de Gaulle&#x27;s most important aides directed the SDECE&#x27;s operations against Canada, having SDECE fund Quebec separatists via the French consulates in Quebec City and Montreal. In 1968, the Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau handed the French ambassador a diplomatic note of protest against SDECE agents operating in Quebec and several SDECE agents in Canada posing as diplomats were declared &quot;persona non grata&quot;. De Gaulle had a deep, visceral hatred of Canada, which he viewed as a second-rate nation that from the French viewpoint had humiliatingly helped to save France, a would-be world power, in both world wars, and de Gaulle sought revenge by seeking to break up Canada. Furthermore, de Gaulle was an Anglophobe and as Canada was a product of the British Empire, this gave him an additional reason to hate Canada. A sign of how much de Gaulle hated Canada because of Canadian sacrifices during both world wars can be seen in that de Gaulle snubbed the remembrance ceremonies for the 20th anniversary of the Dieppe raid in 1962 and the 50th anniversary of Vimy Ridge in 1967 as he claimed he was too busy to attend; by contrast the Germanophile de Gaulle always found time for remembrance ceremonies involving German sacrifices in the world wars as Germany was a fellow would-be world power, meaning that German sacrifices to subjugate France were worthy of the respect and admiration of the French people in a way that Canadian sacrifices to liberate them were not. Marcel Cadieux, the undersecretary of state at the Canadian Ministry of External Affairs from 1964-1970, often wrote in his diary about de Gaulle&#x27;s obsessive hatred of Canada and his willingness to break international law by meddling in the internal affairs of Canada. From 1963 onward, a major concern for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was monitoring the SDECE agents who were supporting Quebec separatism by handing over bags of cash to separatists, and the RCMP viewed the French embassy in Ottawa much like the Soviet embassy; namely as a den of spies working for a hostile foreign power.

===Nigerian Civil War===
During the Nigerian Civil War of 1967-70, the SDECE supported Biafra by supplying the Biafrans with weapons and mercenaries as de Gaulle wanted to break up Nigeria and have oil-rich Biafra in the French sphere of influence. Furthermore, Nigeria, like Canada, was, also, a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic federation that was a product of the British Empire, giving de Gaulle another reason to want to see Nigeria broken up. The SDECE hired Bob Denard, a French mercenary who usually fought for France in &quot;Françafrique&quot; (France&#x27;s sphere of influence in its former African colonies), and company to fight for Biafra. In the fall of 1968, the SDECE hired Rolf Steiner, a German mercenary who had once served in the French Foreign Legion, who together with 4,000 of his men left for Nigeria on a French ship from Lisbon to Libreville, Gabon, from where they were flown into Biafra on French planes. The SDECE often smuggled arms into Biafra on Red Cross planes that were supposed to be bringing food and medical supplies for the starving Ibos as the Federal Nigerian Army used starvation as a weapon to break Biafra.

===Demise===
In 1970, President Georges Pompidou appointed the Comte Alexandre de Marenches SDECE chief with orders to clean up the agency. Marenches described SDECE in 1970 as being more alike to an organized crime racket than an intelligence agency, writing: &quot;Some agents were running drugs and guns; others were engaged in kidnapping, murder and the settling of the most bloody scores&quot;. Marenches severed the links with the SAC (which was finally dissolved in 1982 after the SAC murdered a police officer and his family in 1981), fired half of SDECE&#x27;s 1,000 employees, made the SDECE more professional and less politicised, changed the focus from assassinating enemies of the republic to intelligence gathering, and modernized the procedures for intelligence collecting and analysis. Marenches is generally regarded as the most able of the SDECE directors, and the man who saved the agency from itself, turning what had been an thuggish outfit designed to murder enemies of the state into a more professional intelligence agency. Marenches also restored the ties to the CIA that de Gaulle had broken off, and in 1975 the SDECE worked with the CIA and the government of Zaire to support the National Liberation Front of Angola during the Angolan Civil War. At same time, the SDECE continued with its traditional work of ensuring that the countries in &quot;Françafrique&quot; stayed in the French sphere of influence. Ali Soilih, the president of the Comoros, had proven hostile to French influence after taking power in a 1975 coup, and in 1978 the SDECE hired Bob Denard to stage a coup. On the night of 13 May 1978, Denard and 42 other mercenaries landed on Grande Comore, almost effortlessly annihilated the Comorian forces and by the morning the Comoros was theirs. President Soilih was high on marijuana and naked in his bed together with three nude teenage schoolgirls watching a pornographic film, when Denard kicked in the door to his room to inform him that he was no longer president and had Soilih taken out to be &quot;shot while trying to escape&quot;. In 1981, when the Socialist François Mitterrand became president, he fired Marenches whom he viewed as too conservative and appointed Pierre Marion, the former CEO of Air France as the new intelligence chief of what was renamed the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure (General Directorate of External Security) in 1982.

<text>The Source (Source Telecomputing Corporation) was an early online service, one of the first such services to be oriented toward and available to the general public. The Source described itself as follows:

The Source was in operation from 1978 to 1989, when it was purchased by rival CompuServe and discontinued sometime thereafter. The Source&#x27;s headquarters were located at 1616 Anderson Road, McLean, Virginia, 22102.

== History ==
The Source was founded in 1978 as Digital Broadcasting Corporation by Bill von Meister, with support from Jack R. Taub, a businessman who had been very successful publishing the Scott catalogue of postage stamps. Initially the idea was to transmit email using an unused subcarrier piggy-backed onto FM radio signals. Instead, the two hit on the idea of an &quot;information utility,&quot; using cheap overnight excess capacity in minicomputers and data networks to make online information available to dial-up subscribers. Dialcom Inc., located in Silver Spring, MD was the backbone of The Source and supplied all of the networking, computing power and software development until the sale of The Source to The Reader&#x27;s Digest Association. Robert Ryan was the President and CEO of Dialcom for fifteen years and concurrently served as the founding President of The Source and remained in that role for three years and then decided to return full-time to Dialcom. Having secured publishing rights and put in place the necessary software, the system was announced at Comdex in June 1979. At a launch in New York the following month, Isaac Asimov declared it to be &quot;the start of the information age.&quot; Prices were initially US$100 for a subscription, then $2.75 per hour off-peak. However, the project had already run up large debts, and soon began running out of money. Taub sold an 80% controlling stake to The Reader&#x27;s Digest Association to keep the company afloat. Von Meister initiated legal action, and received a $1 million pay-off. He went on to found Control Video Corporation, which ultimately evolved into AOL.

Reader&#x27;s Digest had high expectations for The Source, and established for the company its own purpose-built installation of Prime minicomputers in McLean, Virginia. However, subscriber numbers were slow to build, and (unlike the leaner set-up at rival CompuServe) this facility became an expensive and under-used overhead to maintain. Losses continued to mount, and chief executives came and went. Rumors abounded of an impending sale, but eventually Control Data Corporation put up $5 million in 1983 in return for stock options, and came in as an operating partner.

As the microcomputer boom continued, subscriptions reached a peak of 80,000 members, but later fell back (compared to 500,000 at CompuServe by 1989). During much of its existence The Source charged a start-up fee of about $100 and hourly usage rates on the order of $10 per hour. In 1984, the registration fee was $49.95, and The Source charged $20.75 per hour between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and $7.75 per hour on nights, weekends and holidays for 300 bits-per-second service. For service at 1200 bits per second there was a $5.00 per hour surcharge during weekday hours, and a $3.00 per hour surcharge at all other times. To place these costs for data services into an historical context, The Source&#x27;s base nighttime and weekend rate of per hour in 1984 was approximately twice the federal minimum hourly wage in this same time period, placing the ability to access data with a personal computer in the hands of businesses and wealthy households only. Just as the expense of books gave rise to the library, the advent of data services provided by school and public library computers was a natural progression during this period in history.

The Source provided news sources, weather, stock quotations, a shopping service, electronic mail, a chat system, various databases, online text of magazines, and airline schedules. It also had a newsgroup-like facility known as PARTICIPATE (or PARTI), which was developed by Participation Systems of Winchester, Massachusetts. PARTICIPATE provided what it called &quot;many to many&quot; communications, or computer conferencing, and hosted &quot;Electures&quot; on The Source, such as Paul Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Space: Humanizing the Universe&quot; in the spring of 1985.

Intended for use with 300 and 1200 baud dial-up telephone connections, The Source was text-based for most of its existence.

<text>&quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1962. It was released as a single and included on his album &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot; in 1963. It has been described as a protest song and poses a series of rhetorical questions about peace, war, and freedom. The refrain &quot;The answer, my friend, is blowin&#x27; in the wind&quot; has been described as &quot;impenetrably ambiguous: either the answer is so obvious it is right in your face, or the answer is as intangible as the wind&quot;.

In 1994, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2004, it was ranked number 14 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. Despite not charting when first released as a single, it has gained much radio airplay, ultimately peaking at #3 in France on the airplay chart.

In June 1963, Peter, Paul and Mary released a cover version of &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; three weeks after &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot; was issued. It became the most commercially successful version of the song, reaching number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was at number one on the Middle-Road charts for five weeks. At the 6th Annual Grammy Awards, this version of the song won two Grammys: Best Folk Recording and Best Performance by a Vocal Group. In 2003, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary&#x27;s version of &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

== Origins and initial response ==
Dylan originally wrote and performed a two-verse version of the song; its first public performance, at Gerde&#x27;s Folk City on April 16, 1962, was recorded and circulated among Dylan collectors. Shortly after this performance, he added the middle verse to the song. Some published versions of the lyrics reverse the order of the second and third verses, apparently because Dylan simply appended the middle verse to his original manuscript, rather than writing out a new copy with the verses in proper order. The song was published for the first time in May 1962, in the sixth issue of &quot;Broadside&quot;, the magazine founded by Agnes &#x27;Sis&#x27; Cunningham and Gordon Friesen and devoted to topical songs.
The theme may have been taken from a passage in Woody Guthrie&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, in which Guthrie compared his political sensibility to newspapers blowing in the winds of New York City streets and alleys. Dylan was certainly familiar with Guthrie&#x27;s work; his reading of it had been a major turning point in his intellectual and political development.

In June 1962, the song was published in &quot;Sing Out!&quot;, accompanied by Dylan&#x27;s comments:

Dylan recorded &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; on July 9, 1962, for inclusion on his second album, &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;, released in May, 1963.
Bobby Darin recorded &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; on July 30, 1963, for inclusion on his album, &quot;Golden Folk Hits&quot;, also released in 1963. Arranged by Walter Raim, there was Roger Mcguinn, Glen Campbell, James Burton, and Phil Ochs all on guitar, and singing harmony.

In his sleeve notes for &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;, John Bauldie wrote that Pete Seeger first identified the melody of &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; as an adaptation of the old African-American spiritual &quot;No More Auction Block/We Shall Overcome&quot;. According to Alan Lomax&#x27;s &quot;The Folk Songs of North America&quot;, the song was sung by former slaves who fled to Nova Scotia after Britain abolished slavery in 1833. In 1978, Dylan acknowledged the source when he told journalist Marc Rowland: &quot;&#x27;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&#x27; has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called &#x27;No More Auction Block&#x27; – that&#x27;s a spiritual and &#x27;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&#x27; follows the same feeling.&quot; Dylan&#x27;s performance of &quot;No More Auction Block&quot; was recorded at the Gaslight Cafe in October 1962, and appeared on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;.

The critic Michael Gray suggested that the lyric is an example of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;quiet incorporation of Biblical rhetoric into his own&quot;, starting with a text from the Old Testament book of Ezekiel (12:1–2): &quot;Son of Man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see and see not; they have ears to hear and hear not.&quot; which Dylan transforms into: &quot;Yes&#x27; n&#x27; how many times must a man turn his head / Pretending he just doesn&#x27;t see?&quot; and &quot;Yes&#x27;n&#x27; how many ears must one man have / Before he can hear people cry?&quot;

&quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; has been described as an anthem of the civil rights movement. In Martin Scorsese&#x27;s documentary on Dylan, &quot;No Direction Home&quot;, Mavis Staples expressed her astonishment on first hearing the song and said she could not understand how a young white man could write something that captured the frustration and aspirations of black people so powerfully. Sam Cooke was similarly deeply impressed by the song, incorporating it into his repertoire soon after its release (a version would be included on &quot;Sam Cooke at the Copa&quot;), and being inspired by it to write &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;.

&quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; was first covered by the Chad Mitchell Trio, but their record company delayed release of the album containing it because the song included the word &quot;death&quot;, so the trio lost out to Peter, Paul and Mary, who were represented by Dylan&#x27;s manager, Albert Grossman. The single sold 300,000 copies in the first week of release and made the song world-famous. On August 17, 1963, it reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart, with sales exceeding one million copies. Peter Yarrow recalled that, when he told Dylan he would make more than $5,000 () from the publishing rights, Dylan was speechless. Peter, Paul and Mary&#x27;s version of the song also spent five weeks atop the easy listening chart.

The critic Andy Gill wrote,

Dylan performed the song for the first time on television in the UK in January 1963, when he appeared in the BBC television play &quot;Madhouse on Castle Street&quot;. He also performed the song during his first national US television appearance, filmed in March 1963, a performance made available in 2005 on the DVD release of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s PBS television documentary on Dylan, &quot;No Direction Home&quot;.

An allegation that the song was written by a high-school student named Lorre Wyatt (a member of Millburn High School&#x27;s &quot;Millburnaires&quot; all-male folk band) and subsequently purchased or plagiarised by Dylan before he gained fame was reported in an article in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine in November 1963. The plagiarism claim was eventually shown to be false.

== Legacy ==

In the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, Jenny sings this song for a show in a strip club and is introduced as &quot;Bobbi Dylan&quot;. The film&#x27;s soundtrack album features Joan Baez&#x27;s 1975 live recording of the song, from her 1976 album &quot;From Every Stage&quot;.

In 1975, the song was included as poetry in a high-school English textbook in Sri Lanka. The textbook caused controversy because it replaced Shakespeare&#x27;s work with Dylan&#x27;s.

During the protests against the Iraq War, commentators noted that protesters were resurrecting songs such as &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; rather than creating new ones.

The song has been embraced by many liberal churches, and in the 1960s and 1970s it was sung both in Catholic church &quot;folk masses&quot; and as a hymn in Protestant ones. In 1997, Bob Dylan performed three other songs at a Catholic church congress. Pope John Paul II, who was in attendance, told the crowd of some 300,000 young Italian Catholics that the answer was indeed &quot;in the wind&quot; – not in the wind that blew things away, but rather &quot;in the wind of the spirit&quot; that would lead them to Christ. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI (who had also been in attendance) wrote that he was uncomfortable with music stars such as Dylan performing in a church environment. The Westboro Baptist Church has parodied the song.

In 2009, Dylan licensed the song to be used in an advertisement for the British consumer-owned Co-operative Group. The Co-op claimed that Dylan&#x27;s decision was influenced by &quot;the Co-op&#x27;s high ethical guidelines regarding fair trade and the environment.&quot; The Co-op, which is owned by about 3 million consumers, also includes Britain&#x27;s largest funeral parlour and farming business.

In &quot;Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&quot;, in the level &quot;Temple of Bwahmanweewee&quot;, Beep-0 parodies this song.

Hip hop group Public Enemy reference it in their 2007 Dylan tribute song &quot;Long and Whining Road&quot;: &quot;Tears of rage left a friend blowing in the wind / But time is God, been back for ten years, and black again&quot;.

Nik Cohn describes &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; as &quot;the first anti-war song ever to make the charts and truthfully, it was possibly the worst song that he&#x27;s written, it was embarrassing in its mimsiness, but that wasn&#x27;t the point: it changed things regardless, it changed the whole concept of what could or couldn&#x27;t be attempted in a hit song. Suddenly, pop writers could go beyond three-chord love songs, they didn&#x27;t have to act mindless anymore. Mostly, they could say what they meant.&quot;

==Peter, Paul and Mary recording==

The most commercially successful version is by folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary, who released the song in June 1963, three weeks after &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot; was issued. Albert Grossman, then managing both Dylan and Peter, Paul and Mary, brought the trio the song which they promptly recorded (on a single take) and released. The trio&#x27;s version, which was the title track of their third album, peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 behind &quot;Fingertips&quot; by Stevie Wonder. The group&#x27;s version also went to number one on the Middle-Road charts for five weeks. &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;a medium-paced sailor’s lament sung with feeling and authority by the folk trio.&quot;

In 1964 at the 6th Annual Grammy Awards, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary won two Grammys for &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;: Best Folk Recording and Best Performance by a Vocal Group. In 2003, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary&#x27;s version of &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

===Chart performance===
== Other versions ==
&quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; has been recorded by hundreds of other artists. 
*Marlene Dietrich recorded a German version of the song (titled &quot;&quot;) which peaked at number 32 in Germany chart.
*Tore Lagergren wrote lyrics in Swedish, &quot;&quot; (&quot;and the wind gives answer&quot;), which charted at Svensktoppen for two weeks in 1963, first as recorded by Otto, Berndt och Beppo, peaking at number 8 on October 12, and by Lars Lönndahl during November 9–15 with sixth &amp; seventh position. Both were released on single A-sides in 1963. This version was also recorded by Sven-Ingvars as the B-side of the single &quot;&quot;, released in March 1967. With these lyrics, the song also charted at Svensktoppen in 1970, with Michael med Salt och peppar.
*In 1966, Stevie Wonder recorded his own version which became a top 10 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, as well as number one on the R&amp;B charts. It reached #12 in Canada.
* In 2022, Dylan sold a newly recorded version of the song, produced by T Bone Burnett, on a new &quot;one of one&quot; analogue format known as an &quot;Ionic Original&quot; disc. The disc was sold via Christie&#x27;s auction house for $1.78 million.
Joan Baez and Dylan have recorded this song live numerous times, and Baez recorded her own version.

<text>The Directorate-General for External Security (, , DGSE) is France&#x27;s foreign intelligence agency, equivalent to the British MI6 and the American CIA, established on 2 April 1982. The DGSE safeguards French national security through intelligence gathering and conducting paramilitary and counterintelligence operations abroad, as well as economic espionage. It is headquartered in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. 

The DGSE operates under the direction of the French Ministry of Armed Forces and works alongside its domestic counterpart, the DGSI (General Directorate for Internal Security). As with most other intelligence agencies, details of its operations and organization are highly classified and not made public.

The DGSE follows a system which it refers to as LEDA. L stands for loyalty (loyauté), E stands for elevated standards (exigence), D stands for discretion (discrétion) and A stands for adaptability (adaptabilité). These are taken as essential in managing intelligence work and in collaborating with agents, authorities and partners.
==History==

===Origins===
The DGSE can trace its roots back to 27 November 1943, when a central external intelligence agency, known as the &quot;DGSS&quot; (&quot;Direction générale des services spéciaux&quot;), was founded by politician Jacques Soustelle. The name of the agency was changed on 26 October 1944, to DGER (&quot;Direction générale des études et recherches&quot;). As the organisation was characterised by numerous cases of nepotism, abuses and political feuds, Soustelle was removed from his position as Director.

Former free-fighter André Dewavrin, aka &quot;Colonel Passy&quot;, was tasked to reform the DGER; he fired more than 8,300 of the 10,000 full-time intelligence workers Soustelle had hired, and the agency was renamed SDECE (&quot;Service de documentation extérieure et de contre-espionnage&quot;) on 28 December 1945. The SDECE also brought under one head a variety of separate agencies – some, such as the well-known &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot;, aka &quot;2e Bureau&quot;, created by the military circa 1871–1873 in the wake of the birth of the French Third Republic. Another was the BRCA (&quot;Bureau central de renseignements et d&#x27;action&quot;), formed during WWII, from July 1940 to November 27, 1943, with André Dewavrin as its head.

On 2 April 1982, the new socialist government of François Mitterrand extensively reformed the SDECE and renamed it DGSE. The SDECE had remained independent until the mid-1960s, when it was discovered to have been involved in the kidnapping and presumed murder of Mehdi Ben Barka, a Moroccan revolutionary living in Paris. Following this scandal, it was announced that the agency was placed under the control of the French Ministry of Defence. In reality, foreign intelligence activities in France have always been supervised by the military since 1871, for political reasons mainly relating to anti-Bonapartism and the rise of Socialism. Exceptions related to telecommunications interception and cyphering and code-breaking, which were also conducted by the police in territorial France, and by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs abroad, and economic and financial intelligence, which were also carried out initially by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, from 1915 onwards, by the Ministry of Commerce until the aftermath of WWII, when the SDECE of the Ministry of Defence took over the specialty in partnership with the Ministry for the Economy and Finance.

In 1992, most of the defence responsibilities of the DGSE, no longer relevant to the post-Cold War context, were transferred to the Military Intelligence Directorate (DRM), a new military agency. Combining the skills and knowledge of five military groups, the DRM was created to close the intelligence gaps of the 1991 Gulf War.

===Cold War-era rivalries===
The SDECE and DGSE have been shaken by numerous scandals. In 1968, for example, Philippe Thyraud de Vosjoli, who had been an important officer in the French intelligence system for 20 years, asserted in published memoirs that the SDECE had been deeply penetrated by the Soviet KGB in the 1950s. He also indicated that there had been periods of intense rivalry between the French and U.S. intelligence systems. In the early 1990s a senior French intelligence officer created another major scandal by revealing that the DGSE had conducted economic intelligence operations against American businessmen in France.

A major scandal for the service in the late Cold War was the sinking of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; in 1985. The &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; was sunk by DGSE operatives, unintentionally killing one of the crew. They had set two time-separated explosive charges to encourage evacuation, but photographer Fernando Pereira stayed inside the boat to rescue his expensive cameras and drowned following the second explosion. (See below in this article for more details). The operation was ordered by the French President, François Mitterrand. New Zealand was outraged that its sovereignty was violated by an ally, as was the Netherlands since the killed Greenpeace activist was a Dutch citizen and the ship had Amsterdam as its port of origin.

===Political controversies===
The agency was conventionally run by French military personnel until 1999, when former diplomat Jean-Claude Cousseran was appointed its head. Cousseran had served as an ambassador to Turkey and Syria, as well as a strategist in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Cousseran reorganized the agency to improve the flow of information, following a series of reforms drafted by Bruno Joubert, the agency&#x27;s director of strategy at that time.

This came during a period when the French government was formed as a cohabitation between left and right parties. Cousseran, linked to the Socialist Party, was therefore obliged to appoint Jean-Pierre Pochon of the Gaullist RPR as head of the Intelligence Directorate. Being conscious of the political nature of the appointment, and wanting to steer around Pochon, Cousseron placed one of his friends in a top job under Pochon. Alain Chouet, a specialist in terrorism, especially Algerian and Iranian networks, took over as chief of the Security Intelligence Service. He had been on post in Damascus at a time when Cousseran was France&#x27;s ambassador to Syria. Chouet began writing reports to Cousseran that bypassed his immediate superior, Pochon.

Politics eventually took precedence over DGSE&#x27;s intelligence function. Instead of informing the president&#x27;s staff of reports directly concerning President Chirac, Cousseran informed only Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin, who was going to run against Chirac in the 2002 presidential election. Pochon learned of the maneuvers only in March 2002 and informed Chirac&#x27;s circle of the episode. He then had a furious argument with Cousseran and was informally told he wasn&#x27;t wanted around the agency anymore. Pochon nonetheless remained Director of Intelligence, though he no longer turned up for work. He remained &quot;ostracized&quot; until the arrival of a new DGSE director, Pierre Brochand, in August 2002.

==Organization==
Note: The whole section described the DGSE until 2022, the DGSE has been restructured in 2022 and is now organized differently.

===Divisions===
The DGSE includes the following services:
* Directorate of Administration
* Directorate of Strategy
* Directorate of Intelligence
** Political intelligence service
** Security intelligence service
* Technical Directorate (Responsible for electronic intelligence and devices)
* Directorate of Operations
** Action Division (Responsible for clandestine operations)

====Technical Directorate (or COMINT Department)====
In partnership with the Direction du renseignement militaire, DRM (Directorate of Military Intelligence) and with considerable support from the Army in particular, and from the Air Force and the Navy to lesser extent, the DGSE is responsible for electronic spying abroad. Historically the Ministry of Defence in general has always been much interested in telecommunications interception. 
In the early 1880s a partnership between the Post Office (also in charge of all national telegraphic communications) and the Army gave birth to an important military telegraphy unit of more than 600 men; it settled in the Fort of the Mont Valérien near Paris. In 1888, the military settled the first service of telecommunications interception and deciphering in the Hôtel des Invalides, Paris—where it is still active today as an independent intelligence agency secretly created in 1959 under the name &quot;Groupement Interministériel de Contrôle&quot; or GIC (Inter-ministerial Control Group).

In 1910, the military unit of the Mont Valérien grew up with the creation of a wireless telecommunication station, and three years later it transformed into a regiment of about 1000 men. Anecdotally, government domestic Internet tapping and its best specialists are still located in the same area today (in underground facilities in Taverny and surroundings), though unofficially and not only. At about the same time, the Army and the Navy created several &quot;listening stations&quot; in the region of the Mediterranean Sea, and they began to intercept the coded wireless communications of the British and Spanish navies. It was the first joint use of wireless telegraphy and Cryptanalysis in the search for intelligence of military interest.

In the 1970s, the SDECE considerably developed its technical capacities in code-breaking, notably with the acquisition of a supercomputer from Cray.
In the 1980s, the DGSE heavily invested in satellite telecommunications interception, and created several satellite listening stations in France and overseas. The department of this agency responsible for telecommunications interception was anonymously called &quot;Direction Technique&quot; (Technical Directorate).
But in the early 1990s the DGSE was alarmed by a steady and important decrease of its foreign telecommunication interception and gathering, as telecommunication by submarine cables was supplanting satellites. At that time the DGSE was using Silicon Graphics computers for code-breaking while simultaneously asking Groupe Bull computers to develop French-made supercomputers. Until then, the DGSE had been sheltering its computers and was carrying code-breaking 100 feet underground its headquarters of Boulevard Mortier, lest of foreign electronic spying and possible jamming. But this underground facility quickly became too small and poorly practical. That is why from 1987 to 1990 important works were carried on in the underground of the Taverny Air Base, whose goal was to secretly build a large communication deciphering and computer analysis center then called &quot;Centre de Transmission et de Traitement de l&#x27;Information&quot;, CTTI (Transmission and Information Processing Center). The CTTI was the direct ancestor of the Pôle National de Cryptanalyse et de Décryptement–PNCD (National Branch of Cryptanalysis and Decryption), launched to fit a new policy of intelligence sharing between agencies called &quot;Mutualisation du Renseignement&quot; (Intelligence Pooling). Once the work was finished, the huge underground of the former Taverny Air base, located in Taverny a few miles northeast of Paris, sheltered the largest Faraday cage in Europe (for protection against leaks of radio electric waves (see also Tempest (codename) for technical explanations) and possible EMP, attacks (see Nuclear electromagnetic pulse for technical explanations), with supercomputers working 24/7 on processing submarine cable telecommunications interception and signal deciphering. The Taverny underground facility also has a sister base located in Mutzig, also settled underground, which officially is sheltering the 44e Régiment de Transmissions, 44e RT (44th Signal Regiment). For today more than ever, signal regiments of the French Army still carries on civilian telecommunication interceptions under the pretense of training and military exercises in electronic warfare in peacetime. The DGSE otherwise enjoys the technical cooperation of the French companies Orange S.A. (which also provides cover activities to the staff of the Technical Directorate of the DGSE), and Alcatel-Lucent for its know-how in optical cable interception.

Allegedly, in 2007–2008 State Councilor Jean-Claude Mallet advised newly elected President Nicolas Sarkozy to invest urgently in submarine cable tapping, and in computer capacities to automatically collect and decipher optical data. This was undertaken in the early 2000s. Mallet planned the installation of a new computer system to break codes. Officially, this enormous foreign intelligence program began in 2008, and it was all set in 2013. Its cost would have amounted 700 million euros, and resulted in a first hiring of about 600 new DGSE employees, all highly skilled specialists in related fields. Since then the DGSE is constantly expending its staff of specialists in cryptanalysis, decryption and signal and computer engineers. For in 2018 about 90% of world trade is no longer going through satellites, but submarine fiber-optic cables drawn between continents. And the Technical Directorate of the DGSE mainly targets intelligence of financial and economic natures.

Remarkably, the DGSE, along with the DRM with which it works closely, have established together a partnership in telecommunication interception with its German counterpart the BND (the &quot;Technische Aufklärung&quot;, or Technical Directorate of this agency more particularly), and with an important support from the French Army with regard to infrastructures and means and staff. Thanks to its close partnership with the DRM, the DGSE also enjoys the service of the large spy ship French ship Dupuy de Lôme (A759), which entered the service of the French Navy in April 2006. The DGSE and the DRM since long also have a special agreement in intelligence with the United Arab Emirates, thanks to which these agencies share with the German BND a COMINT station located in the Al Dhafra Air Base 101. The DGSE also enjoys a partnership in intelligence activities with the National Intelligence Agency (South Africa).

Today the French intelligence community would rank third in the world behind the American National Security Agency and British GCHQ in capacities of telecommunication interceptions worldwide.

====Action Division====

The action division (&quot;Division Action&quot;) is responsible for planning and performing clandestine operations. It also performs other security-related operations such as testing the security of nuclear power plants (as it was revealed in &quot;Le Canard Enchaîné&quot; in 1990) and military facilities such as the submarine base of the Île Longue, Bretagne. The division&#x27;s headquarters are located at the fort of Noisy-le-Sec. As the DGSE has a close partnership with the &quot;&quot; of the Army or COS (Special Operations Command), the Action Division selects most of its men from regiments of this military organization, the &quot;1er Régiment de Parachutistes d&#x27;Infanterie de Marine&quot;, 1er R.P.I.Ma (1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment) and the &quot;13e Régiment de Dragons Parachutistes&quot;, 13e RDP (13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment) in particular. But, in general, a large number of DGSE executives and staff members under military statuses, and also of operatives first enlisted in one of these two last regiments, and also in the past in the &quot;11e régiment parachutiste de choc&quot;, 11e RPC (11th Shock Parachute Regiment), colloquially called &quot;11e Choc,&quot; and in the &quot;1er Bataillon Parachutiste de Choc&quot;, 1er BPC (1st Shock Parachute Battalion), colloquially called &quot;1er Choc.&quot;

===Installations===

The DGSE headquarters, codenamed CAT (&quot;Centre Administratif des Tourelles&quot;), are located at 141 Boulevard Mortier in the 20th arrondissement in Paris, approximately 1 km northeast of the Père Lachaise Cemetery. The building is often referred to as &quot;La piscine&quot; (&quot;the swimming pool&quot;) because of the nearby Piscine des Tourelles of the French Swimming Federation.

A project named &quot;Fort 2000&quot; was supposed to allow the DGSE headquarters to be moved to the fort of Noisy-le-Sec, where the Action Division and the &quot;Service Technique d&#x27;Appui&quot; or &quot;STA&quot; (Technical and Support Service) were already stationed. However, the project was often disturbed and interrupted due to lacking funds, which were not granted until the 1994 and 1995 defence budgets. The allowed budget passed from 2 billion francs to one billion, and as the local workers and inhabitants started opposing the project, it was eventually canceled in 1996. The DGSE instead received additional premises located in front of the &quot;Piscine des Tourelles&quot;, and a new policy called &quot;Privatisation des Services&quot; (Privatization of the Services) was set. Roughly speaking, the Privatization of the Services consists for the DGSE in creating on the French territory numerous private companies of varied sizes, each being used as cover activity for specialized intelligence cells and units. This policy allows to turn round the problem of heavily investing in the building of large and highly secured facilities, and also of public and parliamentary scrutinies. This method is not entirely new however, since in 1945 the DGER, ancestor of the DGSE, owned 123 anonymous buildings, houses and apartments in addition to the military barracks of Boulevard Mortier serving already as headquarters. And this dispersion of premises began very early at the time of the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot;, and more particularly from the 1910s on, when intelligence activities carried on under the responsibility of the military knew a strong and steady rise in France.

===Size and importance===
* In 2007 the DGSE employed a total of 4,620 agents. In 1999 the DGSE was known for employing a total of 2,700 civilians and 1,300 Officers or Non Commissioned Officers in its service.
* It also benefits from an unknown number of voluntary correspondents (spies), French nationals in a large majority of instances, both in France and abroad who do not appear on the government&#x27;s list of civil servants. Those for long were referred to with the title of &quot;&quot; (honourable correspondent) or &quot;HC,&quot; and since a number of years as &quot;. Whereas the DGSE calls a &quot; any French and foreign nationals this agency recruits indistinctly as &quot;conscious&quot; and willing or &quot;unconscious or unwilling (i.e. manipulated) spy.&quot; While a DGSE&#x27;s agent trained and sent to spy abroad generally is referred to as &quot;operative&quot; in English-speaking countries, the DGSE internally calls such agent &quot; (flying agent) by analogy with a butterfly (and not a bird). This agency, however, also colloquially calls &quot; (swallow) a female operative. And it collectively and indistinctly calls &quot;&quot; (sensors) its &quot;contacts&quot;, &quot;sources&quot;, and &quot;flying agents&quot;.
* The DGSE is directly supervised by the Ministry of Armed Forces.

===Budget===
The DGSE&#x27;s budget is entirely official (it is voted upon and accepted by the French parliament). It generally consists of about €500M, in addition to which are added special funds from the Prime Minister (often used in order to finance certain operations of the Action Division). How these special funds are spent has always been kept secret.

Some known yearly budgets include:
* 1991: FRF 0.9bn
* 1992: FRF 1bn
* 1997: FRF 1.36bn
* 1998: FRF 1.29bn
* 2007: EUR 450 million, plus 36 million in special funds.
* 2009: EUR 543.8 million, plus 48.9 million in special funds.

According to Claude Silberzahn, one of its former directors, the agency&#x27;s budget is divided in the following manner:
* 25% for military intelligence
* 25% for economic intelligence
* 50% for diplomatic intelligence

==Logo==
As of 18 July 2012 the organisation had inaugurated its current logo. The bird of prey represents the sovereignty, operational capacities, international operational nature, and the efficiency of the DGSE. France is depicted as a sanctuary in the logo. The lines depict the networks utilized by the DGSE.

==Activities==

===Range===
Various tasks and roles are generally appointed to the DGSE:
*Intelligence gathering:
**HUMINT, internally called &quot;ROHUM,&quot; which stands for &quot;Renseignement d&#x27;Origine Humaine&quot; (Intelligence of Human Origin), is carried on by a large network of agents and under-agents, &quot;contacts&quot;, and &quot;sources&quot; who are not directly and officially paid by the DGSE in a large majority of instances and by reason of secrecy, but by varied public services and private companies which are not all necessarily cover-ups by vocation however, and which thus cooperate through particular and unofficial agreements. But many under-agents, &quot;contacts&quot; and &quot;sources&quot; act out of patriotism and political/ideological motives, and they are not all aware to help an intelligence agency.
**SIGINT, (COMINT/SIGINT/ELINT), internally called &quot;ROEM,&quot; which stands for &quot;Renseignement d&#x27;Origine Electromagnétique&quot; (Intelligence of Electromagnetic Origin), is carried on from France and from a network of COMINT stations overseas, each internally called &quot;Centre de Renseignement Électronique&quot;, CRE (Electronic Intelligence Center). And then two other names are used to name: smaller COMINT/SIGINT territorial or oversea stations, internally called &quot;Détachement Avancé de Transmission&quot;, CAT (Signal Detachment Overseas); and specifically ELINT and SIGINT stations indifferently located on the French soil and overseas, each called &quot;Centre de Télémesure Militaire&quot;, CTM (Military Telemetry Center). Since the 1980s, the DGSE focuses much of its efforts and financial expenditures in communications interception (COMINT) abroad, which today (2018) has a reach extending from the east coast of the United States to Japan, with a focus on the Arabian Peninsula between these two opposite areas. In the DGSE in particular, those considerable and very expensive COMINT capacities are under the official responsibility of its &quot;Direction Technique&quot;, DT, (Technical Directorate). But as these capacities are rapidly growing and passively involve about all other French intelligence agencies (more than 20) in the context of a new policy called &quot;Mutualisation du Renseignement&quot; (Intelligence pooling between agencies) officially decreed in 2016, the whole of it is called &quot;Pôle National de Cryptanalyse et de Décryptement&quot;, PNCD (National Branch of Cryptanalysis and Decryption) since the early 2000s at least. Earlier and from 1987 to 1990 on in particular, the PNCD was called &quot;Centre de Transmission et de Traitement de l&#x27;Information&quot;, CTTI (Transmission and Information Processing Center), and its main center is secretly located underground the Taverny Air Base, in the eastern Paris&#x27; suburb. Otherwise, the French press nicknamed the French COMINT capacities and network Frenchlon, borrowing to ECHELON, its U.S. equivalent.
**Space imagery analysis: integrated in the &quot;ROIM&quot; general mission, standing for &quot;Renseignement d&#x27;Origine Image&quot; (Intelligence of Image Origin).
*Special operations, such as missions behind enemy lines, exfiltrations otherwise called extraction, Coup d&#x27;état and revolution of palace and counter-revolutions (in African countries in particular since WWII), and sabotages and assassinations (on the French soil as abroad), with the help of the regiments of the Special Operations Command, COS.
*Counterintelligence on the French soil is not officially acknowledged by the DGSE, as this is officially part of the general mission of the General Directorate for Internal Security, DGSI, along with counter-terrorism in particular. But in reality, and for several reasons, the DGSE has indeed for a long time also carried out counterintelligence missions on French soil, which it calls &quot;contre-ingérence&quot; (counter-interference), as well as much &quot;offensive counterintelligence&quot; operations abroad. As a matter of fact the former name of the DGSE, the SDECE, means &quot;Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage&quot; (External Documentation and Counter-Espionage Service). Counterintelligence activities in the DGSE are integrated in a more general mission internally called &quot;Mesures actives&quot; (active measures), directly inspired by the Russian Active measures in their principles. That is why offensive counterintelligence (or counter-interference) in the DGSE has multiple and direct connections with the other and different fields of &quot;counter-influence&quot; and influence (i.e. on the French soil as abroad) (see Agent of influence), and also by extension with Agitprop operations (all specialties in intelligence rather called Psychological warfare in English-speaking countries).

===Known operations===
====1970s====
* Under the codename &quot;Operation Caban&quot;, the SDECE staged a coup d&#x27;état against Emperor Jean-Bédel Bokassa in the Central African Empire in September 1979, and installed a pro-French government.
* Between the early 1970s and the late 1980s, the SDECE/DGSE had effectively planted agents in major U.S. companies, such as Texas Instruments, IBM and Corning. Some of the economic intelligence thus acquired was shared with French corporations, such as the &quot;Compagnie des Machines Bull&quot;.

====1980s====
* Working with the DST in the early 1980s, the agency exploited the source &quot;Farewell&quot;, revealing the most extensive technological spy network uncovered in Europe and the United States to date. This network had allowed the United States and other European countries to gather significant amounts of information about important technical advances in the Soviet Union without the knowledge of the KGB. However, former DGSE employee Dominique Poirier contends, in his book he self-published in May 2018, that KGB Lt-Colonel Vladimir Vetrov code-named &quot;Farewell&quot; could not possibly reveal, alone, the names of 250 KGB officers acting abroad undercover, and help identify nearly 100 Soviet spies in varied western countries, at least by reason of the rule of &quot;compartmentalization&quot; or need to know. 
* The DGSE exploited a network called &quot;Nicobar&quot;, which facilitated the sale of forty-three Mirage 2000 fighter jets by French defence companies to India for a total of more than US$2 billion, and the acquisition of information about the type of the armour used on Soviet T-72 tanks.
* &quot;Operation Satanique&quot;, a mission aimed at preventing protests by Greenpeace against French nuclear testing in the Pacific through the sinking of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; in Auckland, New Zealand, on July 10, 1985. A French navy limpet mine exploded at 11:38 pm when many of the crew were asleep, and blew a large hole in the ship&#x27;s hull. A second limpet mine exploded on the propeller shaft when Fernando Pereira, ships photographer, returned to retrieve his camera equipment, he was trapped in his cabin and drowned. New Zealand Police initiated one of their country&#x27;s largest investigations and uncovered the plot after they captured two DGSE agents, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and arson. French relations with New Zealand were sorely strained, as they threatened New Zealand with EEC sanctions in an attempt to secure the agents&#x27; release. Australia also attempted to arrest DGSE agents to extradite them. The incident is still widely remembered in New Zealand. The uncovering of the operation resulted in the firing of the head of the DGSE and the resignation of the French Defence Minister.

====1990s====
* During the Rwandan Civil War, the DGSE had an active role in passing on disinformation, which resurfaced in various forms in French newspapers. The general trend of this disinformation was to present the renewed fighting in 1993 as something completely new (although a regional conflict had been taking place since 1990) and as a straightforward foreign invasion, the rebel RPF being presented merely as Ugandans under a different guise. The disinformation played its role in preparing the ground for increased French involvement during the final stages of the war.
* During 1989–97, DGSE helped many Chinese dissidents who participated in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 escape to western countries as a part of Operation Yellowbird.
*During the Kosovo War, the DGSE played an active role in providing weapons training for the KLA. According to British wartime intercepts of Serbian military communication, DGSE officers took part in active fighting against Serbian forces. It was even revealed that several DGSE officers had been killed alongside KLA fighters in a Serbian ambush.
* Reports in 2006 have credited DGSE operatives for infiltrating and exposing the inner workings of Afghan training camps during the 1990s. One of the spies employed by the agency later published a work under the pseudonym &quot;Omar Nasiri&quot;, uncovering details of his life inside Al-Qaeda.

====2000s====
* A DGSE general heads the Alliance Base, a joint CTIC set up in Paris in cooperation with the CIA and other intelligence agencies. Alliance Base is known for having been involved in the arrest of Christian Ganczarski.
* In 2003, the DGSE was held responsible for the outcome of &quot;Opération 14 juillet&quot;, a failed mission to rescue Íngrid Betancourt Pulecio from FARC rebels in Colombia.
* In 2004, the DGSE was credited for liberating two French journalists, Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot, who were held as hostages for 124 days in Iraq.
* DGSE personnel were part of a team that arranged the release on June 12, 2005, of French journalist Florence Aubenas, held hostage for five months in Iraq.
*DGSE was said to be involved in the arrest of the two presumed killers of four French tourists in Mauritania in January 2006.
* In 2006, the French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Est Républicain&quot; acquired an apparently leaked DGSE report to the French president Jacques Chirac claiming that Osama bin Laden had died in Pakistan on August 23, 2006, after contracting typhoid fever. The report had apparently been based on Saudi Arabian intelligence. These &quot;death&quot; allegations were thereafter denied by the French foreign minister Philippe Douste-Blazy and Saudi authorities, as well as CIA Bin Laden specialist Michael Scheuer.
* In 2007–10, DGSE undertook an extensive operation to track est. 120 Al-Qaeda terrorists in FATA region of Pakistan.
* In June 2009, DGSE uncovered evidence that two registered passengers on board Air France Flight 447, which crashed with the loss of 228 lives in the vicinity of Brazil, were linked to Islamic terrorist groups.

====2010s====
* November 2010, three operatives from DGSE&#x27;s Service Operations (SO) (formerly Service 7) botched an operation to burgle the room of China Eastern Airlines&#x27; boss Shaoyong Liu at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Toulouse. Failure of the operation resulted in the suspension of all of SO&#x27;s activities and the very survival of the unit was called into question. SO only operates on French soil, where it mounts secret HUMINT operations such as searching hotel rooms, opening mail or diplomatic pouches.
* In the year 2010/11, the DGSE has been training agents of Bahrain&#x27;s National Security, the intelligence service which is trying to subdue the country&#x27;s Shi&#x27;ite opposition protests. Bahrain&#x27;s Special Security Force also benefits from a French advisor seconded from the Police Nationale who is training the Special Security Force in modern anti-riot techniques.
* March 2011, the DGSE sent several members of the Service Action to support the Libyan rebels. However, most of the agents deployed were from the Direction des Operations&#x27; Service Mission. The latter unit gathers intelligence and makes contact with fighting factions in crisis zones.
* In January 2013, Service Action members attempted to rescue one of its agents held hostage. The rescue was a failure as the hostage was killed alongside 2 DGSE operators.
* In 2014, DGSE in a joint operation with AIVD, had successfully infiltrated and planted hidden cameras in Cyber Operations Center under SVR in Russia.
** The DGSE, with the NDS, ran a joint intelligence unit in Afghanistan known as &quot;Shamshad&quot; until the Taliban captured Kabul.
* In 2017, DGSE concluded that Russia sought to influence France&#x27;s 2017 presidential elections by generating social media support for the far-right candidate.
* In 2017–19, Action Division assassinated 3 major terrorist leaders of JNIM
* In 2018–19, DGSE in a joint operation with CIA, DGSI, MI6 and FIS, tracked and identified 15 members of the Unit 29155, who were using Chamonix as a &#x27;base camp&#x27; to conduct covert operations around Europe.
* In 2020, DGSE along with CIA, had supplied the intelligence to COS, in their operation to kill Abdelmalek Droukdel.

<text>Live on the Black Hand Side is a double-disc live album by American heavy metal band Danzig. It was recorded at various shows between 1992 and 2000 (including Danzig&#x27;s infamous Halloween &#x27;92 show at Irvine Meadows, CA), and was released in 2001 on Glenn Danzig&#x27;s Evilive Records label, distributed by Restless Records. It is the first official, full-length live album from the band, however, the 1993 EP, &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot; and select CD singles have featured live material. In fact, &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive,&quot; includes four additional live tracks from the Halloween &#x27;92 show that are not included on this release.

The original, studio version of the song &quot;Halloween II&quot; was recorded by Glenn Danzig&#x27;s first band, the Misfits.

<doc id="572327" wikidata="Q300917" url="?curid=572327" title="XBase">
<text>xBase is the generic term for all programming languages that derive from the original dBASE (Ashton-Tate) programming language and database formats. These are sometimes informally known as dBASE &quot;clones&quot;. While there was a non-commercial predecessor to the Ashton-Tate product (Vulcan written by Wayne Ratliff), most clones are based on Ashton-Tate&#x27;s 1986 dBASE III+ release — scripts written in the dBASE III+ dialect are most likely to run on all the clones.

==History of the X==
Ashton-Tate always maintained that everything relating to dBASE was proprietary, and as a result, filed lawsuits against several of the &quot;clone&quot; software vendors. One effect of this action was to cause the clone vendors to avoid using the term &quot;dBASE&quot;: a trademark term held by Ashton-Tate. This gave rise to the creation of the generic term &quot;xBase&quot; meaning &quot;dBASE or dBASE-like.&quot; A suggested name that narrowly failed was &quot;*base&quot; (pronounced &quot;star base&quot; and an homage to Vulcan and &quot;Star Trek&quot;), and some wanted it spelled &quot;X-base&quot; to further differentiate it from the trademark.

==Standards effort==
By 1987 there were an increasing number of &quot;clone&quot; software products that mimicked dBASE. Each of these products had its own unique set of supported language features and syntax. As such, it was often very difficult to move code developed with one dBASE-like product to run in another one. (This was in contrast to older programming languages such as C or COBOL where due to published official standards, carefully developed code could possibly be run in a wide range of software environments.) While there were many cries for a standard for the dBASE programming language syntax, nothing would happen as long as Ashton-Tate asserted ownership of all-things dBASE.

Once Borland acquired Ashton-Tate in mid-1991 (and was apparently required to drop the lawsuits as an antitrust related condition of the merger), such standardization efforts were given new life. An ANSI committee (ANSI/X3J19) was officially formed, and began regular meetings in 1992. Marc Schnapp was the first chairman, and the first meeting was held at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California which was essentially the birthplace of Vulcan and dBASE II. The group met on a regular basis in a variety of locations over the next few years, and representatives from most major vendors participated. But despite lip service from all the vendors on the need for a standard, no one seemed willing to change their product syntax to match that of a competitor.

==Influences over time==
In 1989, Microtrend Books published the first &quot;Xbase&quot; cross-reference book (before the term was coined), &quot;The dBASE Language Handbook&quot;, by David M. Kalman, which covered Quicksilver, Clipper, , dBASE III, dBASE III Plus, dBASE IV, and FoxBase+. At more than 1,000 pages, it compared the execution of commands and functions to enable developers to build and maintain portable applications.

In 1993, Sybex, Inc. (computer books) published the &quot;Xbase Cross Reference Handbook&quot;, by Sheldon M. Dunn, another cross reference of the most commonly used xBase languages at that time – dBASE III+, dBASE IV, FoxPro for DOS, FoxPro for Windows, FoxPro for Macintosh and Clipper 5.1. At 1,352 pages and 5.1 pounds shipping weight, the Cross Reference was hardly a handbook, but it provided the xBase community with an up-to-date, all-in-one reference manual, and addressed one of the major documentation problems that the community was facing. The software companies had decided to break their manuals into sections, separating commands from functions, etc., and splitting the (previous) manual into two or three different manuals, and the community was left trying to figure what-was-what and which manual to keep close at hand. 1993 was pivotal for the xBase community because, as previously noted, Ashton-Tate had earlier sold dBASE as well as the rest of their product line to Borland and Microsoft had purchased FoxPro from Fox Software. Borland had also purchased QuickSilver to get a foot up the development ladder for a dBASE version for Windows (then 3.1). In 1994, Borland launched dBase V for Windows and dBASE V for DOS before selling the dBASE name and product line to dBASE Inc.

In recent years there seems to be a renewed interest in xBase, mostly because of a number of open source, portable, xBase implementations (listed below), and the scripting applicability of the language. While newer desk-top database tools are optimized for mouse usage, xBase has always been &quot;keyboard friendly&quot;, which helps make scripting and meta-programming (automating the automation) easier. Meta-programming generally does not work as well with mouse-oriented techniques because automating mouse movements can require calculating and processing of screen coordinates, something most developers find tedious and difficult to debug. xBase is one of the few table-oriented scripting languages still available.

==Interpreted versus compiled==

xBase products generally split into an interpreted camp and the compiler camp. The original product was interpreted, but the &quot;clones&quot;, led by Clipper, began creating compiler versions of the product. Compiling improved overall run-time speed and source-code security, but at the expense of an interpreted mode for interactive development or ad-hoc projects.

<text>Jean-Philippe Loys de Cheseaux (; 4 May 1718 – 30 November 1751) was a Swiss astronomer.

== Biography ==

Loys de Cheseaux was born on 4 May 1718 in Lausanne, Vaud, to Paul-Etienne Loys de Cheseaux, a banneret, and Estienne-Judith de Crousaz. His brother was Charles-Louis Loys de Cheseaux. He was educated by his maternal grandfather, the mathematician and philosopher Jean-Pierre de Crousaz, and wrote his first essays, under the title &quot;Essais de Physique&quot;, in 1735, aged 17.

In 1736, Loys de Cheseaux installed an observatory in his father&#x27;s lands in Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne. He acquired a reputation in Europe as an astronomer with the publication of his &quot;Traité de la Comète&quot;, in 1744, a treatise on his observations of the comet C/1743 X1 in which he also became one of the first to state, in its modern form, what would later be known as Olbers&#x27; paradox (that, if the universe is infinite, the night sky should be bright). 

After his discovery of C/1743 (along with Dirk Klinkenberg), Loys de Cheseaux discovered the comet C/1746 P1. In 1746, he presented a list of nebulae, eight of which were his own new discoveries, to the French Academy of Sciences. The list was noted privately by Le Gentil in 1759, but only made public in 1892 by Guillaume Bigourdan. 

From 1747, Loys de Cheseaux was a corresponding member of the science academies of Göttingen, St. Petersburg, Stockholm, as well as the Academy of Sciences of Paris and the Royal Society of London. He was offered the post of director of the St. Petersburg observatory, but declined the invitation. In 1751, Loys de Cheseaux travalled to Paris and was presented to the Academy of Sciences. There he died, after a short illness, on 30 November 1751, aged 33.

In addition to astronomy, Loys de Cheseaux researched Biblical chronology, calculating the movements of the Sun and Moon relative to descriptions in the Book of Daniel and the occurrence of solstices and equinoxes in Jerusalem at the time of the Old Testament story. In his &quot;Dissertation Chronologique&quot; (1748), Loys de Cheseaux tried to establish the date of the eclipse known as &quot;crucifixion darkness&quot; in order to determine the date of the crucifixion of Jesus.

<doc id="572337" wikidata="Q5791104" url="?curid=572337" title="International crisis">
<text>The term international crisis is a widespread term without a single common definition. To some, it involves &quot;a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of war&quot;.

==Types==
Lebow gives a breakdown of three types of international crises:
* Justification of hostilities. One of the nations decides, before the crisis starts, to go to war and constructs a crisis to justify it. The pattern of justification is almost always the same: Rouse public opinion, make impossible demands, try to legitimize the demands, deny your real intentions then employ the rejection of the demands as a reason for war. A recent example, commonly employed by critics of George W. Bush, is the Iraq disarmament crisis, which precipitated the Iraq War.
* Spinoff crisis. The nations are involved in a war or crisis with another nation or nations and this precipitates another crisis, e.g. the Lusitania incident in 1915.
* Brinkmanship. Intentionally forcing a crisis to get the other side to back down. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 is a well-known example of brinkmanship.

With the exception of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but must be visibly prepared to do so.

==Strategies==
George&#x27;s book presents an overview of the process and conflicting goals of crisis management as well as many examples. He discusses a number of strategies, including:

===Offensive strategies===
*blackmail
*limited and reversible response
*controlled pressure
*attrition
*fait accompli

===Defensive strategies===
*coercion
*limited escalation
*tit-for-tat
*test of capabilities
*&quot;drawing a line&quot;
* buying time strategy
* conveying commitment and resolve to avoid miscalculation by the adversary

==List of defused crises==
International crises tend to result in war, almost by definition; they are then remembered best not as crises but as causes of wars. For information on international crises that resulted immediately in war, see list of wars.

Given the above, some of the crises that are best-known &quot;as crises&quot; were defused. The following crises did not immediately provoke large-scale violence, but set off anger in countries:

* War in sight crisis (1875)
*Samoan Crisis (1887–1889), between the United States of America, England, and Germany

*Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03, between Venezuela and Britain, Germany and Italy
* First Moroccan Crisis (1904–1906)
*Dutch–Venezuelan crisis of 1908, between Venezuela and the Netherlands
* Bosnian crisis (1908–1909)
* Agadir Crisis (1911)
* Åland crisis (1916–1920)
* Remilitarization of the Rhineland (1936)

<text>Le Raincy () is a prestigious commune in the eastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the center of Paris. Le Raincy is a subprefecture of the Seine-Saint-Denis department and the seat of the Arrondissement of Le Raincy.

Its population is small relative to surrounding communes, just under 15,000. However, its development as an administrative centre, along with the establishment over the years of several schools, gives it more prominence than its population size would suggest.

Its character has made it known as &quot;le Neuilly de la Seine-Saint-Denis&quot;.

==History==

In the 17th and 18th century, Raincy was known primarily as location of the Château du Raincy, now demolished. The commune of Le Raincy was created on 20 May 1869 by detaching a part of the territory of Livry-Gargan and merging it with a part of the territory of Clichy-sous-Bois and a small part of the territory of Gagny.

=== Heraldry ===
==Population==
==Notre-Dame du Raincy==

The town today receives visitors - mainly to see the Notre-Dame du Raincy church. Designed by the brothers Auguste and Gustave Perret and built in 1922–1923, this was one of the first churches to be built in reinforced concrete, and with no external ornamentation. The architecture is remarkable for the classicism of its columns, greatly enhanced by the stained glass windows of Maurice Denis and Marie-Alain Couturier. The church is listed as an historic monument. It was restored in the 1990s, and is in regular use. Many of the visitors to the church come from Japan, as a smaller replica of Notre Dame du Raincy was built in the Tokyo suburbs.

==Transport==
Le Raincy is served by Le Raincy – Villemomble – Montfermeil station on Paris RER line E.

==Education==
Secondary schools:
* Junior high school: Collège Jean-Baptiste Corot
* Senior high schools/sixth-form colleges:
**Lycée René Cassin
**Lycée Albert Schweitzer

=== Notable People ===
* Manuel Ferrara, pornographic actor and director

==Twin towns==
Le Raincy is twinned with:
* London Borough of Barnet, United Kingdom
* Clusone, Italy
* Yavne, Israel

<doc id="572339" wikidata="Q28154803" url="?curid=572339" title="Golden-bellied capuchin">
<text>The golden-bellied capuchin (Sapajus xanthosternos), also known as the yellow-breasted or buff-headed capuchin, is a species of New World or neotropical monkey. It lives mainly in trees and are omnivorous, eating a wide variety of both plant and animals as food. Golden-bellied capuchin normal home range is in the Atlantic forest of Brazil and it is critically endangered due to forest fragmentation and habitat loss mainly due to agriculture, there are currently efforts to protect them by the local government.

== Characteristics ==
Although there are differences between individuals as well as between the sexes and across age groups, &quot;S. xanthosternos&quot; is described as having a distinctive yellow to golden red chest, belly and upper arms. Its face is a light brown and its cap for which the capuchins were first named is a dark brown/black or light brown. Formerly thought to be a subspecies of tufted capuchin (&quot;S. apella&quot;), it was elevated to the status of species. Despite this previous classification, &quot;S. xanthosternos&quot; does not have very evident tufts, as they are oriented towards the rear of the skull and are hardly noticeable. A band of short hair around the upper part of the face with speckled colouring contrasts with the darker surrounding areas. The limbs and tail are also darkly coloured.

=== Size ===
Capuchins males stand around tall weighing an average of . Females are tall at round . Their prehensile tails are about the same length as their bodies and is helpful for swinging and climbing through the canopy. Capuchins have opposable big toes and long fingers assisting with climbing as well.

=== Life span ===
Capuchins life span is around 15–25 years when living in the wild. They can live much longer in captivity to about 50 years.

=== Origins ===
Capuchins falling under the genus of &quot;Sapajus&quot; and &quot;Cebus&quot; are believed to have a common ancestor originating in the Atlantic forest. Primates under the genus &quot;Sapajus&quot; then continued to live and occupy the Atlantic forest evolving into the species we know today such as &quot;Sapajus xanthosternos.&quot; 

== Distribution and habitat ==
Populations of &quot;S. xanthosternos&quot; are restricted to the Atlantic forest of south-eastern Bahia, Brazil, due possibly to high degrees of interference from humans. Historically they probably would have inhabited the entire area east of, and north to, the Rio São Francisco.

The largest continuous area of forest in its known range, the Una Biological Reserve in Bahia, is estimated to contain a population of 185 individuals. As of 2004, there were 85 individuals in zoos and breeding facilities in Europe and Brazil.

=== Habitat fragmentation ===
The native biome of &quot;S. xanthosternos,&quot; the Atlantic forest of Brazil, is heavily fragmented with the majority of remaining forest fragment smaller than 50 hectares. Some of the remaining forests are maintained due to the presence of agroforests called cabrucas. The presence of these agroforests provide a habitat for local flora and fauna including &quot;S. xanthosternos.&quot; The remaining forest fragments tend to be surrounded by human activity such as farms, this is both beneficial and detrimental to the capuchins since they are able to raid crops to supplement their diet. This behavior, however, may lead to more confrontation and hunting by humans.

The ideal size of a forest fragment in order to properly sustain a population of &quot;S. xanthosternos&quot; is deemed to be larger than a range of approximately 400 to 700 hectares depending on local conditions, with currently approximately 2% of forest fragments being over 400 hectares this poses an issue for conservation.

== Behavior ==
Capuchins are arboreal, living mainly in trees.

=== Social ===
Capuchins live in groups consisting of about 3-30 individuals with a hierarchy determining their social status. There is usually an equal number of males to females living together with a male and female alpha. The rest of the individuals are lower in rank. The alpha male will defend his territory if approached by another group. Capuchins spend much of their time grooming each other as a means of socialization with the alpha getting the most attention. They often participate in “urine washing” by covering themselves in their own urine to mark their territory. This scent will travel with them.

=== Communication ===
Capuchins communicate making short and frequent yipping whines similar to a newborn pup. When in danger, they emit a two-toned clunking noise. Many of the noises Capuchins make are similar to bird sounds. They also communicate through chemical signals to express territory boundaries as well as during mating rituals.

=== Space use ===
&quot;S. xanthosternos&quot; will use forest areas with more cover and protection from predators, even if it means avoiding areas of high food availability. There are also behavioral differences when the capuchins are within different types of forest, such as being more spread out in the capruca while staying lower in the canopy and closer together in secondary forests. Capuchins will change strategies in order to reduce the risk that they perceive within their habitats.

=== Predation ===
Their coloration makes them camouflage into their habitat making them more difficult to spot by a predator. When capuchins are on the ground or near water, they can fall prey to predators such as snakes, large raptors, crocodiles, or large carnivorous mammals. The larger the group, the less chance they have of becoming prey due to a higher number of vigilant individuals. If a predator is spotted, the Capuchin will alert the others using their alarm call. Capuchins have acute olfactory senses helping them to distinguish scent marks left behind by other groups.

==== Hunting ====
Hunting is a major threat to &quot;S. xanthosternos&quot; and its ability to have populations survive long-term in forest fragments. Hunting is especially problematic in areas close to human activity such as agroforests (cabrucas) and farmland. There is an elevated perceived risk of predation in the capuchins behavior when it is in an area of forest that give a greater advantage to predators, such as reduced canopy coverage in cabruca and in areas that transition from other forest types to a cabruca.

=== Diet ===
Golden-bellied capuchins feed on both plant and animal origins making them omnivores. They mostly feed on plants such as fruits, seeds, flowers, nuts, leaves and stems, and nectar. They also eat insects, bird eggs, frogs, small reptiles, birds, bats, or other small mammals. Capuchins residing near marine areas will feed on oysters, crabs or other shellfish. &quot;Sapajus xanthosternos&quot; has been known to hunt and eat various small lizards, sometimes ripping limbs off of the lizards before consuming them.

=== Reproduction ===
Capuchins can mate year-round but females will give birth every two years. A female&#x27;s gestation period is 150–180 days and give birth to one infant. Newborns are 100% reliant on their mothers for their first year of life and become independent around 6–12 months. Female Capuchins reach maturity around 4–5 years old and start mating and giving birth at 7–8 years old. Males reach maturity and are fertile around 6–8 years.

=== Mating ===
Capuchins mate with more than one partner making them polygynandrous. The alpha-male of the group always has first choice of which female will be his mate. The other males of the group are also sexually active but the alpha has the most reproductive success. The alpha-male is most desired by the females as he will provide the most protection to his young. Unique mating rituals occur in order for the female to attract a male. She will first raise her eyebrows and move her head back and forth. She will touch him and runaway while murmuring noises. The male will make eye contact with her and also make noises. They perform a dance just before mating by jumping and spinning in the air. Just after mating, they will continue the dance for several seconds.

== Conservation ==
=== Status ===
The Capuchin is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered. The population of the Capuchin within the last 50 years has declined over 50%. Any remaining habitats are protected including the largest place called Una Biological Reserve in Bahia, Brazil, home to about 185 Capuchin.

=== Threats ===
Capuchins are endemic to Brazil&#x27;s rainforests which are in danger of deforestation for agriculture and logging. This is causing fragmentation of the forests threatening their habitat. Groups of Capuchins are being separated from one another causing interbreeding which results in biodiversity loss ultimately causing an extinction vortex. Capuchins are also in danger of being hunted.

==== Pet trade ====
Capuchins are regularly captured in order to be sold in the illegal pet trade. In relation to species conservation it has been noted that the capture of a female creates a negative impact on a group&#x27;s ability to survive than if a male is captured. Infants may also be sold into the pet trade, however this can be seen as a byproduct of hunting the mothers.

=== Current efforts ===
There is an effort in place by the Brazilian National Action Plan for the Conservation of the Northeastern Primates to protect a number of endangered primate species including &quot;S. xanthosternos.&quot;

<text>Russell Stewart Boyd, , ACS, ASC, (born 21 April 1944) is an Australian cinematographer.

==Career==
He rose to prominence with his highly praised work on &quot;Picnic at Hanging Rock&quot; (1975), the first of several collaborations with director Peter Weir. Boyd is a member of both the Australian Cinematographers Society since 1975 and the American Society of Cinematographers since 2004.

Boyd served as cinematographer for &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;, a 1983 film about an alcoholic country singer played by Robert Duvall. Boyd largely utilized available light to give the film a natural feeling which director Bruce Beresford said was crucial to the movie. Actress Tess Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used only three words: &quot;Yeah, right and sure.&quot;

For his work on the 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;, Boyd won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography.

In 2021, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for &quot;distinguished service to the visual arts as a cinematographer of Australian feature films and television productions&quot; in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

<doc id="572346" wikidata="Q232625" url="?curid=572346" title="Pied tamarin">
<text>The pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor), sometimes referred to as the Brazilian bare-faced tamarin, is a critically endangered species of primate found in a restricted area of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. It was named the mascot of Manaus, Brazil in 2005. The species is endangered due to the increasing size of the city of Manaus, which is encroaching on their native habitat.

== Distribution and habitat ==
A New World monkey, the pied tamarin is found at the city limits of Manaus, the capital of the Amazonas state of Brazil and up to to the north and to the east. A tamarin group has a home range of . The main distribution is in the interfluvial areas of the Rio Cuieiras and Rio Preto da Eva. Pied tamarins are also found in the adjacent interfluvial areas of the Rio Preto da Eva and Rio Urubu, but are comparatively rare. The pied tamarin is found in old-growth forests, sand forest and smaller secondary forest fragments. Their density is higher in secondary forest fragments than in primary forest.

== Description ==
The pied tamarin does not exhibit sexual dimorphism, as both males and females weigh around and are roughly in length. Furthermore, both male and female tamarins exhibit the same coloration: they have a black furless face with a white upper body and a lower body that can range in color from a light to dark brown. Their furless face gives them the nickname &quot;Brazilian bare-faced tamarin.&quot;

The pied tamarin does not have nails, but instead has claws that allow them to quickly scale trees in order to retrieve food or escape predators. These claws also allow the tamarin to dig into tree bark and extract sap to eat.

Its life expectancy is approximately 10 years in the wild, but can be extended to double that in captivity.

== Behavior ==

=== Diet ===
Pied tamarins are omnivorous; their diet consisting of gums, saps, fruit, flowers, nectar, insects, spiders, small vertebrates and bird eggs. During the dry season, when tree gums and saps are less available, they consume smaller animals.

Due to their omnivorous diets, pied tamarins are responsible for seed dispersal and the regulation of small animal populations such as insects and amphibians.

=== Group structure and reproduction ===
Individuals live in groups of 2 to 15 members with little intragroup competition. The average group size in the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke is 4.8 individuals per group, and other areas around Manaus reported mean group sizes of 6.19. Generally, group sizes range from 2 to 15 individuals.

Pied tamarin groups are mixed, containing multiple males and females. A single dominant female is the only one in the group to reproduce, and the dominant female suppresses the estrus cycles of the other females through the release of pheromones. 

=== Reproduction ===
Like other tamarin species, the pied tamarins are polyandrous, as the dominant female mates with multiple males. Due to the pheromones released by the dominant female, none of the other females in the group mate with other males. The fact that only one female per group produces offspring inhibits their population growth. The breeding period lasts from March to May. When the dominant female becomes pregnant, she usually will give birth to twins after a 120-to-195 day long gestation period.

Young tamarins are cared for primarily by the father and turned over to the mother only to nurse; however, the entire group helps with the care of the alpha female&#x27;s offspring, a behavior known as alloparenting.

== Conservation ==

=== Classification ===
As of 2015, the pied tamarin is rated critically endangered by the IUCN Red List. The pied tamarin&#x27;s population is expected to decline 80% by 2033 due to anthropogenic threats, competition with golden-handed tamarin (&quot;Saguinus midas&quot;), and disease. It is on the IUCN list for the top 25 most endangered primates in Brazil. 

=== Causes of endangerment ===
The pied tamarins&#x27; natural predators are small cats, birds of prey, and snakes. Their habitat has been lost due to expansion of the city of Manaus. Within the Manaus area, pied tamarins are threatened by domestic and feral cats and dogs, electrocution from power lines, and the pet trade. Additionally, rural settlement and increasing livestock agriculture continue to encroach upon and degrade the pied tamarin&#x27;s remaining habitat. 

Interspecific competition with both the golden-handed tamarin and the red-handed tamarin has led to displacement of the pied tamarin.

=== Protection ===
The pied tamarin is protected in some parts of its range, such as in Sumaúma State Park (), Adolfo Ducke Forest Reserve () and less than half of Puranga Conquista Sustainable Development Reserve (). The Centro de Instrução de Guerra na Selva (CIGS) () is an important protected area for the species; however, it is not a conservation area, but a military jungle training facility, thus making the area&#x27;s status uncertain. 

Both European and American zoos and conservation services have allocated funding to the conservation of pied tamarin species. While there are only two areas in the world that are protected for the tamarins, and both are under 50 hectares, the conservation efforts have allowed for the reforestation of these places and the slow and uncertain return of the pied tamarin&#x27;s native habitat.

There is an established captive breeding program for the pied tamarin and an official studbook. As of 2009, there are 172 pied tamarins in captivity and all are registered property of the Brazilian government. However, their captive breeding success rate is limited.

==In popular culture==
The pied tamarin is featured as a pet in the game Super Auto Pets.

<doc id="572349" wikidata="Q3522328" url="?curid=572349" title="The Principles of Psychology">
<text>The Principles of Psychology is an 1890 book about psychology by William James, an American philosopher and psychologist who trained to be a physician before going into psychology. The four key concepts in James&#x27; book are: stream of consciousness (his most famous psychological metaphor); emotion (later known as the James–Lange theory); habit (human habits are constantly formed to achieve certain results); and will (through James&#x27; personal experiences in life).

==Origins==
The openings of &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot; presented what was known at the time of writing about the localization of functions in the brain: how each sense seemed to have a neural center to which it reported and how varied bodily motions have their sources in other centers.

The particular hypotheses and observations on which James relied are now very dated, but the broadest conclusion to which his material leads is still valid, which was that the functions of the &quot;lower centers&quot; (beneath the cerebrum) become increasingly specialized as one moves from reptiles, through ever more intelligent mammals, to humans while the functions of the cerebrum itself become increasingly flexible and less localized as one moves along the same continuum.

James also discussed experiments on illusions (optical, auditory, etc.) and offered a physiological explanation for many of them, including that &quot;the brain reacts by paths which previous experiences have worn, and makes us usually perceive the probable thing, i.e. the thing by which on previous occasions the reaction was most frequently aroused.&quot; Illusions are thus a special case of the phenomenon of habit.

==Key features==

===Stream of consciousness===
Stream of consciousness is arguably James&#x27; most famous psychological metaphor. He argued that human thought can be characterized as a flowing stream, which was an innovative concept at the time due to the prior argument being that human thought was more so like a distinct chain. He also believed that humans can never experience exactly the same thought or idea more than once. In addition to this, he viewed consciousness as completely continuous.

===Emotion===
James introduced a new theory of emotion (later known as the James–Lange theory), which argued that an emotion is instead the consequence rather than the cause of the bodily experiences associated with its expression. In other words, a stimulus causes a physical response and an emotion follows the response. This theory has received criticism throughout the years since its introduction.

===Habit===
Human habits are constantly formed to achieve certain results because of one&#x27;s strong feelings of wanting or wishing for something. James emphasized the importance and power of human habit and proceeded to draw a conclusion. James noted that the laws of habit formation are unbiased, habits are capable of causing either good or bad actions. And once either a good or bad habit has begun to be established, it is very difficult to change.

===Will===
Will is the final chapter of &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot;, which was through James&#x27; own personal experiences in life. There was one question that troubled James during his crisis, which was whether or not free will existed. &quot;The most essential achievement of the will... when it is most &#x27;voluntary&#x27;, is to attend to a difficult object and hold it fast before the mind...&quot; Effort of attention is thus the essential phenomenon of will.&quot;

==Use of comparative psychology==
In the use of the comparative method, James wrote, &quot;instincts of animals are ransacked to throw light on our own...&quot; By this light, James dismisses the platitude that &quot;man differs from lower creatures by the almost total absence of instincts&quot;. There is no such absence, so the difference must be found elsewhere.

James believed that humans wielded far more impulses than other creatures. Impulses which, when observed out of their greater context, may have appeared just as automatic as the most basic of animal instincts. However, as man experienced the results of his impulses, and these experiences evoked memories and expectations, those very same impulses became gradually refined.

By this reasoning, William James arrived at the conclusion that in any animal with the capacity for memory, association, and expectation, behavior is ultimately expressed as a synthesis of instinct and experience, rather than just blind instinct alone.

==Influence and reception==
&quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot; was a vastly influential textbook which summarized the field of psychology through the time of its publication. Psychology was beginning to gain popularity and acclaim in the United States at this time, and the compilation of this textbook only further solidified psychology&#x27;s credibility as a science. Philosopher Helmut R. Wagner writes that most of the book&#x27;s contents are now outdated, but that it still contains insights of interest.

In 2002, James was listed as the 14th most eminent psychology author of the 20th century, with his theory on emotion (the James-Lange Theory) presented in this book being a contributing factor for that ranking.

In areas outside of psychology, the book was also to have a major impact. The philosopher Edmund Husserl engages specifically with William James&#x27;s work in many areas. Following Husserl, this work would also impact many other phenomenologists. Furthermore, the Anglo-Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein read James&#x27;s work and utilized it in his coursework for students, though Wittgenstein held philosophical disagreements about many of James&#x27;s points. For instance, Wittgenstein&#x27;s critique of William James in sec 342 of &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;.

<text>Jon M. Bridgman (July 10, 1930 – March 9, 2015) was an American historian and a professor emeritus of the University of Washington.

Bridgman, a graduate of Stanford University, and former USN gunnery officer on a destroyer, received his doctorate from Stanford University in 1961 and spent his entire teaching career at the University of Washington. His particular area of expertise was modern European history. He was the recipient of the university&#x27;s Distinguished Teaching Award in 1973. His popularity as a speaker earned him a position lecturing to the annual meeting of the UW Alumni Association from 1987 to 2002, and the alumni have rewarded his retirement by donating funds to endow the Jon Bridgman Professorship in History at the University of Washington.

He taught classes on topics related to his own Past and Present Society, a club for students of history and Bridgman enthusiasts. As a historical writer, he published several works such as &quot;The Revolt of the Hereros (Perspectives on Southern Africa)&quot; and &quot;The End of the Holocaust: The Liberation of the Camps&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the phrase complete partial order is variously used to refer to at least three similar, but distinct, classes of partially ordered sets, characterized by particular completeness properties. Complete partial orders play a central role in theoretical computer science: in denotational semantics and domain theory.

== Definitions ==

The term complete partial order, abbreviated cpo, has several possible meanings depending on context.

A partially ordered set is a directed-complete partial order (dcpo) if each of its directed subsets has a supremum. (A subset of a partial order is directed if it is non-empty and every pair of elements has an upper bound in the subset.) In the literature, dcpos sometimes also appear under the label up-complete poset.

A pointed directed-complete partial order (pointed dcpo, sometimes abbreviated cppo), is a dcpo with a least element (usually denoted formula_1). Formulated differently, a pointed dcpo has a supremum for every directed &quot;or empty&quot; subset. The term chain-complete partial order is also used, because of the characterization of pointed dcpos as posets in which every chain has a supremum.

A related notion is that of ω-complete partial order (ω-cpo). These are posets in which every ω-chain (formula_2) has a supremum that belongs to the poset. The same notion can be extended to other cardinalities of chains. 

Every dcpo is an ω-cpo, since every ω-chain is a directed set, but the converse is not true. However, every ω-cpo with a basis is also a dcpo (with the same basis). An ω-cpo (dcpo) with a basis is also called a continuous ω-cpo (or continuous dcpo).

Note that &quot;complete partial order&quot; is never used to mean a poset in which &quot;all&quot; subsets have suprema; the terminology complete lattice is used for this concept.

Requiring the existence of directed suprema can be motivated by viewing directed sets as generalized approximation sequences and suprema as &quot;limits&quot; of the respective (approximative) computations. This intuition, in the context of denotational semantics, was the motivation behind the development of domain theory.

The dual notion of a directed-complete partial order is called a filtered-complete partial order. However, this concept occurs far less frequently in practice, since one usually can work on the dual order explicitly.

By analogy with the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of a partially ordered set, every partially ordered set can be extended uniquely to a minimal dcpo.

== Examples ==

* Every finite poset is directed complete.
* All complete lattices are also directed complete.
* For any poset, the set of all non-empty filters, ordered by subset inclusion, is a dcpo. Together with the empty filter it is also pointed. If the order has binary meets, then this construction (including the empty filter) actually yields a complete lattice.
* Every set &quot;S&quot; can be turned into a pointed dcpo by adding a least element ⊥ and introducing a flat order with ⊥ ≤ &quot;s&quot; and s ≤ &quot;s&quot; for every &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot; and no other order relations.
* The set of all partial functions on some given set &quot;S&quot; can be ordered by defining &quot;f&quot; ≤ &quot;g&quot; if and only if &quot;g&quot; extends &quot;f&quot;, i.e. if the domain of &quot;f&quot; is a subset of the domain of &quot;g&quot; and the values of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; agree on all inputs for which they are both defined. (Equivalently, &quot;f&quot; ≤ &quot;g&quot; if and only if &quot;f&quot; ⊆ &quot;g&quot; where &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are identified with their respective graphs.) This order is a pointed dcpo, where the least element is the nowhere-defined partial function (with empty domain). In fact, ≤ is also bounded complete. This example also demonstrates why it is not always natural to have a greatest element.
* The set of all linearly independent subsets of a vector space &quot;V&quot;, ordered by inclusion. 
* The set of all partial choice functions on a collection of non-empty sets, ordered by restriction.
* The set of all prime ideals of a ring, ordered by inclusion.
* The specialization order of any sober space is a dcpo.
* Let us use the term “deductive system” as a set of sentences closed under consequence (for defining notion of consequence, let us use e.g. Alfred Tarski&#x27;s algebraic approach). There are interesting theorems that concern a set of deductive systems being a directed-complete partial ordering. Also, a set of deductive systems can be chosen to have a least element in a natural way (so that it can be also a pointed dcpo), because the set of all consequences of the empty set (i.e. “the set of the logically provable/logically valid sentences”) is (1) a deductive system (2) contained by all deductive systems.

== Characterizations ==

An ordered set is a dcpo if and only if every non-empty chain has a supremum. As a corollary, an ordered set is a pointed dcpo if and only if every (possibly empty) chain has a supremum, i.e., if and only if it is chain-complete. Proofs rely on the axiom of choice.

Alternatively, an ordered set formula_3 is a pointed dcpo if and only if every order-preserving self-map of formula_3 has a least fixpoint.

== Continuous functions and fixed-points ==

A function &quot;f&quot; between two dcpos &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is called (Scott) continuous if it maps directed sets to directed sets while preserving their suprema:
* formula_5 is directed for every directed formula_6.
* formula_7 for every directed formula_6.
Note that every continuous function between dcpos is a monotone function. 
This notion of continuity is equivalent to the topological continuity induced by the Scott topology.

The set of all continuous functions between two dcpos &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is denoted [&quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot;]. Equipped with the pointwise order, this is again a dcpo, and pointed whenever &quot;Q&quot; is pointed.
Thus the complete partial orders with Scott-continuous maps form a cartesian closed category.

Every order-preserving self-map &quot;f&quot; of a pointed dcpo (&quot;P&quot;, ⊥) has a least fixed-point. If &quot;f&quot; is continuous then this fixed-point is equal to the supremum of the iterates (⊥, &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(⊥), &quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;f&quot;&amp;hairsp;(⊥)), … &quot;f&quot; &quot;n&quot;(⊥), …) of ⊥ (see also the Kleene fixed-point theorem).

Another fixed point theorem is the Bourbaki-Witt theorem, stating that if formula_9 is a function from a dcpo to itself with the property that formula_10 for all formula_11, then formula_9 has a fixed point. This theorem, in turn, can be used to prove that Zorn&#x27;s lemma is a consequence of the axiom of choice.

<text>Christmastide, also known as Christide, is a season of the liturgical year in most Christian churches. 

For the Catholic Church, Lutheran Church, Anglican Church, Methodist Church and some Orthodox Churches, Christmastide begins on 24 December at sunset or Vespers, which is liturgically the beginning of Christmas Day. Most of 24 December is thus not part of Christmastide, but of Advent, the season in the Church Year that precedes Christmastide. In many liturgical calendars Christmastide is followed by the closely related season of Epiphanytide that commences at sunset on 5 January—a date known as Twelfth Night. 

In many Christian denominations, Christmastide is identical to Twelvetide (Twelve Days of Christmastide). There are several celebrations within Christmastide, including Christmas Day (25 December), Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day (26 December), Childermas (28 December), New Year&#x27;s Eve (31 December), the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ or the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God (1 January), and the Feast of the Holy Family (date varies). The Twelve Days of Christmas terminate with Epiphany Eve or Twelfth Night (the evening of 5 January).

Customs of the Christmas season include carol singing, gift giving, attending Nativity plays, church services, and eating special food, such as Christmas cake. Traditional examples of Christmas greetings include the Western Christian phrase &quot;Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!&quot; and the Eastern Christian greeting &quot;Christ is born!&quot;, to which others respond, &quot;Glorify Him!&quot;

== Dates ==
Christmastide, commonly called the Twelve Days of Christmas, lasts 12 days, from 25 December to 5 January, the latter date being named as Twelfth Night. These traditional dates are adhered to by the Lutheran Church and the Anglican Church.

However, the ending is defined differently by other Christian denominations. In 1969, the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church expanded Christmastide by a variable number of days: &quot;Christmas Time runs from... up to and including the Sunday after Epiphany or after 6 January.&quot; Before 1955, the 12 Christmastide days in the Roman Rite (25 December to 5 January) were followed by the 8 days of the Octave of Epiphany, 6–13 January, and its 1960 Code of Rubrics defined &quot;Christmastide&quot; as running &quot;from I vespers of Christmas to none of 5th January inclusive&quot;. &quot;The Saint Andrew Daily Missal&quot; (1945) says Christmastide begins with &quot;the vigil of the feast [Christmas Day] and ends in the temporal cycle on the octave day of the Epiphany...[and] in the sanctoral cycle on the Purification of our Lady (Feb. 2).&quot; Within the Christmas Cycle is &quot;the time before, during and after the feast itself, thus having for its aim to &quot;prepare&quot; the soul for them, then allow it to &quot;celebrate&quot; them with solemnity and finally to &quot;prolong&quot; them several weeks&quot;; this references Advent, Christmas, and the Time after Epiphany (Epiphanytide).

== History ==

In 567, the Council of Tours &quot;proclaimed the twelve days from Christmas to Epiphany as a sacred and festive season, and established the duty of Advent fasting in preparation for the feast.&quot; Christopher Hill, as well as William J. Federer, states that this was done in order to solve the &quot;administrative problem for the Roman Empire as it tried to coordinate the solar Julian calendar with the lunar calendars of its provinces in the east.&quot; Ronald Hutton adds that, while the Council of Tours declared the 12 days one festal cycle, it confirmed that three of those days were fasting days, dividing the rejoicing days into two blocs. 

In medieval era Christendom, Christmastide &quot;lasted from the Nativity to the Purification.&quot; To this day, the &quot;Christian cultures in Western Europe and Latin America extend the season to forty days, ending on the Feast of the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple and the Purification of Mary on 2 February, a feast also known as Candlemas because of the blessing of candles on this day, inspired by the Song of Simeon, which proclaims Jesus as &#x27;a light for revelation to the nations&#x27;.&quot; Many Churches refer to the period after the traditional Twelve Days of Christmas and up to Candlemas, as Epiphanytide, also called the Epiphany season. The Puritans referred to the season as Christide as they did not affirm the sacrificial aspect of the Mass.

==Traditions==

During the Christmas season, various festivities are traditionally enjoyed and buildings are adorned with Christmas decorations, which are often set up during Advent. These Christmas decorations include the Nativity Scene, Christmas tree, Moravian star, Illuminations and various Christmas ornaments. In the Western Christian world, the two traditional days on which Christmas decorations are removed are Twelfth Night, Baptism of Jesus and Candlemas. Any not removed on the first occasion should be left undisturbed until the second. Leaving the decorations up beyond Candlemas is considered to be inauspicious. &quot;The Saint Andrew Daily Missal&quot; (1945), authored by Dom Gaspar Lefebvre, stipulates:

On Christmas Eve or Christmas Day (the first day of Christmastide), it is customary for most households in Christendom to attend a service of worship or Mass. During the season of Christmastide, in many Christian households, a gift is given for each of the Twelve Days of Christmastide, while in others, gifts are only given on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day or Twelfth Night, the first and last days of the festive season, respectively. The practice of giving gifts during Christmastide, according to Christian tradition, is symbolic of the presentation of the gifts by the Three Wise Men to the infant Jesus.
The tradition of the Nativity scene comes from Italy. One of the earliest representation in art of the nativity was found in the early Christian Roman catacomb of Saint Valentine. It dates to about AD 380. Another, of similar date, is beneath the pulpit in Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, Milan. For the Christian celebration of Christmas, the viewing of the Nativity play is one of the oldest Christmastime traditions, with the first reenactment of the Nativity of Jesus taking place in A.D. 1223 in the Italian town of Greccio. In that year, Francis of Assisi assembled a Nativity scene outside of his church in Italy and children sang Christmas carols celebrating the birth of Jesus. Each year, this grew larger, and people travelled from afar to see Francis&#x27; depiction of the Nativity of Jesus that came to feature drama and music. Nativity plays eventually spread throughout all of Europe, where they remain popular. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day church services often came to feature Nativity plays, as did schools and theatres. In France, Germany, Mexico, and Spain, Nativity plays are often reenacted outdoors in the streets.

In several parts of the world, it is common to have a large family feast on Christmas Day, preceded by saying grace. Desserts such as Christmas cake are unique to Christmastide; in India and Pakistan, a version known as Allahabadi cake is popular. &quot;Panettone&quot;, an Italian type of sweet bread and fruitcake, originally from Milan, Italy, usually prepared and enjoyed for Christmas and New Year in Western, Southern, and Southeastern Europe, as well as in South America, Eritrea, Australia and North America. During the Christmas season, it is also very common for Christmas carols to be sung at Christian churches, as well as in front of houses—in the latter scenario, groups of Christians go from one house to another to sing Christmas carols. Popular Christmas carols include &quot;Silent Night&quot;, &quot;Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus&quot;, &quot;We Three Kings&quot;, &quot;Down in Yon Forest&quot;, &quot;Away in a Manger&quot;, &quot;I Wonder as I Wander&quot;, &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s a Song in the Air&quot;, and &quot;Let all mortal flesh keep silence&quot;. In the Christmas season, it is very common for television stations to air feature films relating to Christmas and Christianity in general, such as &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; and &quot;Scrooge&quot;.

On Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day, the second day of Christmastide, people traditionally have their horses blessed, and on the Feast of Saint John the Evangelist, the third day of Christmastide, wine is blessed and consumed. The fourth day of Christmastide, Childermas (Children&#x27;s Mass), is observed through the blessing of children at church, as well as the remembrance of the Holy Innocents as the first Christian martyrs. On New Year&#x27;s Eve (the seventh day of Christmastide), it is common for many Christians to attend a watchnight service to thank God for being blessed in the previous year and resolving to serve Him in the coming year. Throughout the twelve days of Christmastide, many people view Nativity plays, among other forms of &quot;musical and theatrical presentations&quot;.

In the Russian Orthodox Church, Christmastide is referred to as &quot;Svyatki&quot;, meaning &quot;Holy Days&quot;. It is celebrated from the Nativity of Christ (7 January N.S.) to the Theophany or Baptism of Christ (19 January N.S.). Activities during this period include attending church services, singing Christmas carols and spiritual hymns, visiting relatives and friends, and performing works of mercy, such as visiting the sick, the elderly people, orphans, and giving generous alms.

=== Eastern Christianity ===

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as in the Greek Catholic Churches and Byzantine-Rite Lutheran Churches, Christmas is the fourth most important feast (after Pascha, Pentecost and Theophany). The day after, the Church celebrates the Synaxis of the Theotokos. This means that Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day and the Feast of the Holy Innocents fall one day later than in the West. The coming of the Wise Men is celebrated on the feast itself.

== By country ==

===Italy===

Christmas is one of the major holidays of Italy. Christmas festivities in Italy (, ) begin on 8 December, with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally the Christmas tree is mounted and ends on 6 January, of the following year with the Epiphany (, ), and in some areas female puppets are burned on a pyre (called ), to symbolize, along with the end of the Christmas period, the death of the old year and the beginning of a new one. 

== Suppression by antireligious governments ==
=== Revolutionary France ===

With the atheistic Cult of Reason in power during the era of Revolutionary France, Christian Christmas religious services were banned and the three kings cake of the Christmas-Epiphany season was forcibly renamed the &quot;equality cake&quot; under anticlerical government policies.

=== Soviet Union ===
Under the state atheism of the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other Christian holidays—were prohibited. Saint Nicholas was replaced by Ded Moroz or Grandfather Frost, the Russian Spirit of Winter who brought gifts on New Year&#x27;s, accompanied by the snowmaiden &quot;Snyegurochka&quot; who helps distribute gifts.

It was not until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the prohibition ended and Christmas was celebrated for the first time in Russia after seven decades. Russia had adopted the custom of celebrating New Year&#x27;s Day instead. However, the Orthodox Church Christmas is on 7 January. This is, also, an official national holiday.

=== Nazi Germany ===

European History Professor Joseph Perry wrote that in Nazi Germany, &quot;because Nazi ideologues saw organized religion as an enemy of the totalitarian state, propagandists sought to deemphasize—or eliminate altogether—the Christian aspects of the holiday&quot; and that &quot;Propagandists tirelessly promoted numerous Nazified Christmas songs, which replaced Christian themes with the regime&#x27;s racial ideologies.&quot;

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
The government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China officially espouses state atheism, and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end. In December 2018, officials raided Christian churches just prior to Christmastide and coerced them to close; Christmas trees and Santa Clauses were also forcibly removed.

<doc id="572381" wikidata="Q3291481" url="?curid=572381" title="Willie Pearse">
<text>William James Pearse (; 15 November 1881 – 4 May 1916) was an Irish republican executed for his part in the Easter Rising. He was a younger brother of Patrick Pearse, a leader of the rising.

==Background==
Willie Pearse was born in Dublin and throughout his life lived in the shadow of his brother to whom he was devoted and with whom he formed a particularly close relationship.

Pearse inherited his father&#x27;s artistic abilities and became a sculptor. He was educated at the Christian Brothers School, Westland Row. He studied at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin under Oliver Sheppard. He also studied art in Paris. While attending the Kensington School of Art in London he gained notice for several of his artworks. Some of his sculptures are to be found in Limerick Cathedral, the Cathedral of St. Eunan and St Columba, Letterkenny and several Dublin churches. He was trained to take over his father&#x27;s stonemason business, but gave it up to help run St. Enda&#x27;s School which Patrick had founded in 1908. He was involved in the arts and theatre at St. Enda&#x27;s, and aided the overall running of the school.

==Easter Rising==
Pearse followed his brother into the Irish Volunteers and the Republican movement. He took part in the Easter Rising in 1916, always staying by his brother&#x27;s side at the General Post Office. Following the surrender he was court-martialled and sentenced to death. It has been said that as he was only a minor player in the struggle it was his surname that condemned him. However, at his court martial he emphasised his involvement.

On 3 May, Pearse was granted permission to visit his brother in Kilmainham Gaol, to see him for the final time. However, while Willie was en route, Patrick was executed first. Willie was executed on 4 May. He and his brother were the only two brothers to be executed after the Easter Rising.

==Commemoration==

There are many more public commemorations of Patrick Pearse than of Willie. In 1966, Dublin&#x27;s Westland Row railway station was renamed Pearse Station to honour both Willie and Patrick. Pearse Square and Pearse Street, in Dublin, were renamed in honour of both, Pearse Street (then Great Brunswick Street) having been their birthplace. Many streets and roads in Ireland bear the name Pearse; few name Willie, but there is a Pearse Brothers Park in Rathfarnham. The bridge over the Dodder river on the Rathfarnham Road, between Terenure and Rathfarnham is named after them and carries a plaque depicting the brothers in profile.

Brothers Pearse Athletic Club, founded in Rathfarnham, is named after the two brothers.

Willie Pearse Park in Crumlin, opened in 1949, is named after him.

A number of Gaelic Athletic Association clubs and playing fields are named after both Pearses, and at least one after Willie:
* Armagh: Annaghmore Pearses GAC; Pearse Óg GAC and its grounds, Pearse Óg Park, Armagh
* Cork: CLG Na Piarsaigh, Cork 
* Dublin: Willie Pearse Park, the grounds of Crumlin GAA
* Kerry: Dromid Pearses GAC; Kilflynn Pearses HC (defunct)
* Limerick: CLG Na Piarsaigh, Limerick
* Louth: CPG Na Piarsaigh, Dundalk
* Monaghan: Ballybay Pearse Brothers, and its grounds, Pearse Park
* Tyrone: Dregish Pearse Og GAC; Fintona Pearses GAC; and Galbally Pearses GAC
* Wicklow: Pearses&#x27; Park, Arklow
* London: Brother Pearse&#x27;s GAC, London
* Yorkshire: Brothers Pearse GAC, Huddersfield
* Padraig Pearses GAA club Woodmount County Roscommon.

<doc id="572382" wikidata="Q5165416" url="?curid=572382" title="Continuity correction">
<text>In mathematics, a continuity correction is an adjustment made when a discrete object is approximated using a continuous object.

==Examples==

===Binomial===
If a random variable &quot;X&quot; has a binomial distribution with parameters &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot;, i.e., &quot;X&quot; is distributed as the number of &quot;successes&quot; in &quot;n&quot; independent Bernoulli trials with probability &quot;p&quot; of success on each trial, then

:formula_1

for any &quot;x&quot; ∈ {0, 1, 2, ... &quot;n&quot;}. If &quot;np&quot; and &quot;np&quot;(1 − &quot;p&quot;) are large (sometimes taken as both ≥ 5), then the probability above is fairly well approximated by

:formula_2

where &quot;Y&quot; is a normally distributed random variable with the same expected value and the same variance as &quot;X&quot;, i.e., E(&quot;Y&quot;) = &quot;np&quot; and var(&quot;Y&quot;) = &quot;np&quot;(1 − &quot;p&quot;). This addition of 1/2 to &quot;x&quot; is a continuity correction.

===Poisson===

A continuity correction can also be applied when other discrete distributions supported on the integers are approximated by the normal distribution. For example, if &quot;X&quot; has a Poisson distribution with expected value λ then the variance of &quot;X&quot; is also λ, and

:formula_3

if &quot;Y&quot; is normally distributed with expectation and variance both λ.

==Applications==
Before the ready availability of statistical software having the ability to evaluate probability distribution functions accurately, continuity corrections played an important role in the practical application of statistical tests in which the test statistic has a discrete distribution: it had a special importance for manual calculations. A particular example of this is the binomial test, involving the binomial distribution, as in checking whether a coin is fair. Where extreme accuracy is not necessary, computer calculations for some ranges of parameters may still rely on using continuity corrections to improve accuracy while retaining simplicity.

<doc id="572393" wikidata="Q1642980" url="?curid=572393" title="Hairbrush">
<text>A hairbrush is a brush with rigid (hard or inflexible) or light and soft spokes used in hair care for smoothing, styling, and detangling human hair, or for grooming an animal&#x27;s fur. It can also be used for styling in combination with a curling iron or hair dryer.
A brush is normally used for detangling hair, for example after sleep or showering. A round brush can be used for styling and curling hair, especially by a professional stylist, often with a hair dryer. A paddle brush is used to straighten hair and tame fly-aways. For babies with fine, soft hair, many bristle materials are not suitable due to the hardness; some synthetic materials and horse/goat hair bristles are used instead.

==Animal use==
Special brushes are made for cats, dogs and horses. Two different brushes can be made specifically for either short hairy pets, or long haired pets. For an equine&#x27;s tougher hair, a curry-comb is used.

==Types==
Various types of brushes are used for different purposes, or have special features that are beneficial to certain hair types. For example:

* Round brush: Usually used with a blow dryer to add fullness and movement to the hair. Some have a metal or ceramic base which is designed to heat up during blow drying.
* Vent brush: Vents allow more air flow between the bristles but does not affect the drying time.
* Cushion brush: Bristles are mounted on a rubber cushion or mat for added flexibility, to minimize hair breakage during detangling.
* Paddle brush: A wide base allows more exposure while blow drying; flexible teeth are designed to minimize breakage, though some believe it does not work.
* Detangler brush: Features such as widely spaced, flexible, nylon teeth are designed to be gentle on tangled or knotted hair.
* Boar bristle brush: Tightly spaced boar-hair bristles are designed to increase tension while brushing, to smooth the hair.
* Blow Dryer Attachment: An additional tool that can be attached to a hair blow dryer to brush and dry hair at the same time.

The effects of brushing will be different depending texture and whether the hair is wet or dry. Straight hair typically looks smoother when brushed. Curly hair tends to expand when brushed while dry.

==Materials==
Common materials used for the handle are ebony, rosewood, New Guinea rosewood, beech, ABS plastic and polyacetal. Common materials used for bristles include boar bristle, horsehair, nylon, stainless steel and goat hair.

==United States history==
The earliest U.S. patent for a modern hairbrush was by Hugh Rock in 1854.
A brush with elastic wire teeth along with natural bristles, was patented by Samuel Firey in 1870 as . In 1898, Lyda D. Newman invented an &quot;Improved Hairbrush&quot;, which allowed for easy cleaning and had bristles separated wide enough to allow for easily combing. She was awarded .

<doc id="572396" wikidata="Q1665170" url="?curid=572396" title="Institute of Noetic Sciences">
<text>The Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) is an American non-profit parapsychological research institute. It was co-founded in 1973 by former astronaut Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the Moon, along with investor Paul N. Temple and others interested in purported paranormal phenomena, in order to encourage and conduct research on noetics and human potentials.

The Institute conducts research on topics such as spontaneous remission, meditation, consciousness, alternative healing practices, consciousness-based healthcare, spirituality, human potential, psychic abilities, psychokinesis and survival of consciousness after bodily death. The Institute maintains a free database, available on the Internet, with citations to more than 6,500 articles about whether physical and mental health benefits might be connected to meditation and yoga.

Headquartered outside Petaluma, California, the IONS is situated on a campus that includes offices, a research laboratory and a retreat center (originally the campus of World College West). Researchers associated with it include Dean Radin and Rupert Sheldrake.

==History==

Edgar Mitchell has reported that on his return to Earth, after the 1971 Apollo 14 Moon landing, he had an experience comparable to savikalpa samādhi. He also says that he conducted ESP experiments with earthbound friends during spaceflight. In 1973, along with investor Paul N. Temple and some others, Mitchell co-founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS). It was founded as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 1973. Willis Harman served as president from 1975 until his death in 1997.

The word &quot;noetic&quot; derives from the Greek &quot;nous&quot;, meaning &quot;mind or ways of knowing.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, the Institute&#x27;s director of research pointed to philosopher William James&#x27; 1902 definition of the word as:

... states of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect. They are illuminations, revelations, full of significance and importance, all inarticulate though they remain; and as a rule they carry with them a curious sense of authority. ...

The Institute figures prominently in &quot;The Lost Symbol&quot;, a 2009 work of fiction by best-selling author Dan Brown. Twitter postings on the day before the book&#x27;s release led Institute director Marilyn Schlitz to purchase the book and read it in one sitting. She told NPR that she found ten experiments conducted by the real-world Institute referred to in Brown&#x27;s fictional account. NPR reported that after its publication &quot;traffic to [the institute&#x27;s] website ... increased twelvefold&quot;, applications for membership increased and &quot;journalists from places like Dateline NBC — not to mention NPR ...&quot; were seeking interviews with Schlitz.

The Institute confers the Temple Award for Creative Altruism, biennially. The $25,000 award fund is divided among recipients selected by an independent jury.

==Research==
Projects sponsored by the Institute include a bibliography on the physical and psychological effects of meditation and yoga, and a spontaneous remission bibliography. The Institute has also conducted a number of parapsychological studies into extra-sensory perception, lucid dreaming, telekinesis, and presentiment.

According to &quot;The Roanoke Times,&quot; the Institute is &quot;... devoted to exploring psychic phenomena and the role of consciousness in the cosmos.&quot;

&quot;The Roanoke Times&quot; also noted that co-founder Mitchell&#x27;s assertions &quot;... have often been criticized by skeptics.&quot; Told &quot;your research goes into a number of territories that are regarded with skepticism in some circles&quot;, Mitchell replied:

That&#x27;s what&#x27;s fun about it. We&#x27;re breaking down barriers and finding things. That&#x27;s what science is all about: new discovery. ... There&#x27;s nothing that we have done or have demonstrated that doesn&#x27;t have good science behind it. Skeptics be damned.

The Institute is listed on Stephen Barrett&#x27;s Quackwatch website, for its research on fringe topics.

==Documentaries and publications==
In 1994, TBS broadcast a three-part, six-hour documentary based on work at the Institute, entitled &quot;The Heart of Healing&quot; and narrated by actress Jane Seymour.

Since 2009, the Institute has published a semi-annual bulletin, &quot;The Noetic Post&quot;. From 2003 to 2009, it published a quarterly magazine, &quot;Shift: At the Frontiers of Consciousness&quot;.

==Geographic overview==
The larger Kansas City metropolitan area can be visualized as a map with roughly four quadrants:

The southeast quadrant includes Kansas City, Missouri, and surrounding areas in Missouri. It includes the Grandview Triangle.

The southwest quadrant includes all of Johnson County, Kansas, which includes the towns in the area known as Shawnee Mission, Kansas. Interstate 35 runs diagonally through Johnson County, Kansas, from the southwest to Downtown Kansas City, Missouri.

The northwest quadrant contains Wyandotte, and Leavenworth, counties in Kansas and parts of Platte County, Missouri. Wyandotte County, Kansas (sometimes referred to as just Wyandotte), contains Kansas City, Kansas; Bonner Springs, Kansas; and Edwardsville, Kansas; it is governed by a single unified government. Another bend in the Missouri River forms the county line between Wyandotte County, Kansas, and Platte County, Missouri, to the north and northeast.

The map&#x27;s northeast quadrant is referred to as the Northland. It includes parts of Clay County, Missouri, including North Kansas City, Missouri and Parkville, Missouri. North Kansas City is bounded by a bend in the Missouri River that defines a border between Wyandotte County, Kansas, and Clay County, Missouri, running approximately north–south and a border between North Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Missouri, running approximately east–west. The river bend&#x27;s sharpest part forms a peninsula containing the Kansas City Downtown Airport.

Most east–west streets are numbered and most north–south streets named. Addresses on east–west streets are numbered from Main Street in Kansas City, Missouri, and on north–south streets from St. John Avenue (or the Missouri River, in the River Market area). The direction &#x27;South&#x27; in street and address numbers is generally implied if &#x27;North&#x27; is not specified, except for numbered &#x27;avenues&#x27; in North Kansas City. In the northland, east–west streets use the prefix N.E. or N.W., depending on the side of N. Main on which they lie.

===Air===
The metro has several airports. Primary service is at Kansas City International Airport (MCI), 15 miles northwest of downtown Kansas City, Missouri. It was opened in 1972 as TWA&#x27;s &quot;Airport of the Future&quot;, a global hub for supersonic transport and the Boeing 747. A new single-terminal building was opened on February 28, 2023, to modernize the design, operations, and passenger experience.

The much smaller Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport, immediately north of downtown across the Missouri River, was the original headquarters of Trans World Airlines (TWA) and houses the Airline History Museum. It served as the area&#x27;s major airport until 1972, when Kansas City International (then known as Mid-Continent International Airport and home to an Overhaul Base for TWA) became the primary airport for the metropolitan area after undergoing $150 million in upgrades that had been approved by voters in a 1966 bond issue. Downtown Airport is still used for general aviation and airshows.

Two general aviation airports are in Johnson County, Kansas. New Century AirCenter borders southwest Olathe and northeast Gardner. The primary runway at New Century AirCenter is the second longest runway in the region next to those at Kansas City International Airport. It is from the Logistics Park Kansas City Intermodal Facility. Johnson County Executive Airport has one runway on 500 acres and is the fourth-busiest towered airport in the state of Kansas.

===Rail===
Kansas City is a freight hub served by the BNSF, CPKC, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific. Kansas City Terminal Railway and Kaw River Railroad provide local interchange and switching service.

Amtrak Passenger service is centered at Kansas City, Missouri&#x27;s Union Station and managed by the Kansas City Terminal. Daily long-distance services are Missouri River Runner with two round trips daily to Saint Louis, connecting to Chicago via the Lincoln Service; and Southwest Chief with daily service between Chicago and Los Angeles.

===Transit===
City buses operated by the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) provide most public transportation. The Metro Area Express (MAX) became Kansas City, Missouri&#x27;s first bus rapid transit line in July 2005, and operates and is marketed akin to a rail system instead of a local bus line. The MAX links River Market, Downtown, Union Station, Crown Center, and Country Club Plaza. Buses in Johnson County, Kansas, are operated by Johnson County Transit, known as The JO.

The KC Streetcar is a 2.2-mile modern streetcar line in Downtown Kansas City. Opened to the public in May 2016, it is maintained and operated by the Kansas City Streetcar Authority, a non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees. A ballot initiative to fund construction of the line was approved by voters on December 12, 2012. The system runs between River Market and Union Station, mostly along Main Street, with extensions north and south under consideration.

There are no commuter rail services.

Intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines and Jefferson Lines at the Kansas City Bus Station.

<doc id="572423" wikidata="Q3321067" url="?curid=572423" title="Con Colbert">
<text>Cornelius Bernard Colbert (; 19 October 1888 – 8 May 1916) was an Irish rebel and pioneer of Fianna Éireann. For his part in the Easter Rising of 1916, he was shot by firing squad in Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin, on 8 May 1916.

==Early life==
Born in the townland of Moanleana, Castlemahon, County Limerick, he was the fourth youngest of thirteen children of Michael Colbert, a farmer, and Honora McDermott.

His family moved to the village of Athea when Con was three years old. He was educated at the local national school. In 1901, his family were living in the townland of Templeathea West. A younger brother, James, and a cousin, Michael Colbert, would later serve as TDs.

He left Athea at the age of 16 and went to live with his sister Catherine in Ranelagh, County Dublin. Colbert continued his education at a Christian Brothers school in North Richmond street. He was employed as a clerk in the offices of Kennedy&#x27;s Bakery in Dublin. In 1911, he was living with Catherine, two other siblings and two boarders at a house on Clifton Terrace, Rathmines.

Colbert was a deeply religious Catholic and refrained from smoking or drinking.

==Fianna and Volunteers==

Colbert was sworn into the IRB by his cousin Art O&#x27;Donnell in Art&#x27;s home in 1908. He joined Fianna Éireann at its inaugural meeting in 1909, and rose to Chief Scout. The following year he became a drill instructor at St. Enda&#x27;s School, founded by Patrick Pearse. In 1912 he became head of an Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) circle within the Fianna started by Bulmer Hobson. During 1913 he was one of a number of Fianna who conducted military training at the Forester&#x27;s Hall in Rutland Square (now Parnell Square), and in November that year he joined the Provisional Committee of the newly formed Irish Volunteers.

==Easter Rising==
In the weeks leading up to the Rising, he acted as bodyguard for Thomas Clarke.
Before the Rising, because he lived out of the city he stayed with the Cooney family in the city centre. During Easter Week, he fought at Watkin&#x27;s Brewery, Jameson&#x27;s Distillery and Marrowbone Lane. Thomas MacDonagh at 3.15 p.m. Sunday, 30 April surrendered to Brigadier-General Lowe. MacDonagh then went around the garrisons under his command to arrange for their surrender.

Colbert surrendered with the Marrowbone Lane Garrison along with the South Dublin Union Garrison, which had been led by Éamonn Ceannt. It has been claimed that when the order to surrender was issued, he assumed the command of his unit to save the life of his superior officer, who was a married man. However, this seems to have been a matter of luck - the well known Colbert was picked out immediately by Dublin detectives who had often seen him drilling Fianna Éireann and speaking at anti-recruiting meetings.

They were marched to Richmond Barracks, where Colbert would later be court-martialled. Transferred to Kilmainham Gaol, he was told on Sunday 7 May that he was to be shot the following morning. He wrote no fewer than ten letters during his time in prison. During this time in detention, he did not allow any visits from his family; writing to his sister, he said a visit &quot;would grieve us both too much&quot;.

==Execution==
The night before his execution he sent for Mrs. Ó Murchadha who was also being held prisoner. He told her he was &quot;proud to die for such a cause. I will be passing away at the dawning of the day.&quot; Holding his bible, he told her he was leaving it to his sister. He handed her three buttons from his volunteer uniform, telling her &quot;They left me nothing else,&quot; before asking her when she heard the volleys of shots in the morning for Éamonn Ceannt, Michael Mallin and himself would she say a Hail Mary for the souls of the departed. The soldier who was guarding the prisoner began crying according to Mrs. Ó Murchadha, and recorded him saying &quot;If only we could die such deaths.&quot;

Colbert was shot by firing squad the next morning on 8 May 1916.

==Legacy==
* Colbert Railway Station in Limerick city is named after him.
* Con Colbert Road in Dublin is named in his honour.
* Fianna Fáil Cumann in the University of Limerick is named after him.
* Colbert Street in his native Athea, County Limerick is named after him, as is the local community hall.
* Colbert Avenue and Colbert Park Janesboro, Limerick City are also named after him.

On 4 May 1958 a plaque was erected over a bed in Barringtons Hospital, County Limerick. The plaque has since disappeared.
In May, one hundred years after his execution a full-scale limestone sculpture of him was unveiled at the gable of his one-time house in Moanlena, County Limerick.

<text>The Ralliement créditiste du Québec () was a provincial political party in Quebec, Canada, that operated from 1970 to 1978 (the party was also known as the Parti créditiste from September to December 1973, contesting the 1973 provincial election under that name). It promoted social credit theories of monetary reform, and acted as an outlet for the expression of rural discontent. It was a successor to an earlier social credit party in Quebec, the &quot;Union des électeurs&quot; which ran candidates in the 1940s.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
At its 1963 annual convention in Hull, the Ralliement des créditistes, the Quebec wing of the Social Credit Party of Canada, split from the national organization. It also debated establishing a provincial party. &quot;De facto&quot; party leader Réal Caouette opposed the creation of a provincial party, and convinced delegates to accept the creation of a ten-member committee to study the proposal instead. Caouette argued that the creditistes had no organization and no money to create a provincial party. Furthermore, the social credit proposal for reform of the monetary system could only be implemented at the federal level (as the Social Credit government of William Aberhart in Alberta had learned when it tried to issue “prosperity certificates”). Most of the support for the creation of a provincial party came from the separatist element in the party, many of whom were also members of the Parti républicain du Québec led by Marcel Chaput.

However, the party later decided to test the provincial waters by contesting four by-elections held on October 8, 1969. All four candidates, who appeared on the ballot as &quot;unaffiliated&quot; candidates (&quot;sans désignation&quot;), were defeated, finishing in second place behind the Union Nationale candidates. The Quebec Liberal Party and the Parti Québécois did not contest those by-elections.

Despite those results, a provincial wing was established, under the name &quot;Ralliement créditiste du Québec&quot;, to compete in the next provincial elections. Gaston Tremblay, a Christian Nationalist Member of the National Assembly (MNA) (elected as a Union Nationale member in 1966) became the first Ralliement créditiste MNA late in 1969. The party was officially founded on January 25, 1970. Camil Samson, the new party&#x27;s president, was elected as leader of the party on March 22, 1970.

=== 1970 election ===
In the April 29, 1970 elections, the créditistes benefited from the decline of the conservative Union Nationale party and made a modest breakthrough, winning 12 seats in the National Assembly and 11.2% of the vote. The party was never able to build on this initial success because it was wracked continually by internal divisions.

On February 13, 1972, faced by challenges from within his party, Camil Samson resigned as leader, and a leadership convention was planned for March 18–19, 1972: Armand Bois (MNA for Saint-Sauveur) was chosen interim leader on February 21.

On March 16, Camil Samson was expelled from the party by nine of the créditiste MNAs (organized by Armand Bois) for criticizing some of the caucus members, and for not attending party meetings. On March 19, Samson declared himself to be the leader of a new créditiste group, and demanded to be seated in the National Assembly as a member of the &quot;Registered Ralliement créditiste du Québec&quot;&#x27;, along with two other créditiste MNAs, Aurèle Audet (Abitibi-Ouest) and Bernard Dumont (Mégantic). However, the speaker of the National Assembly recognized Armand Bois as parliamentary leader of the party. On August 11, Samson, Dumont and Audet rejoined the &quot;Ralliement créditiste du Québec&quot;.

On February 4, 1973, Yvon Dupuis was elected leader of the Ralliement créditiste du Québec over Samson. The party was renamed the Parti créditiste. Samson was named leader in the National Assembly. On February 21, Armand Bois, the former interim leader, was expelled from the party for saying at the February 4 leadership convention that Yvon Dupuis&#x27;s entourage included members of the Montreal underworld. Bois sat as an independent créditiste until October 3, when he apologized for his statements and asked to be readmitted to the party.

Dupuis failed to win a by-election to enter the National Assembly, and was pressured to quit the leadership of the party. On May 5, 1974, Dupuis resigned as leader of the Parti créditiste, and formed the Parti présidentiel. Dupuis resigned as leader of that party on October 21, 1974, and ended his political career. The Parti présidentiel was merged into the Union Nationale a year later.

=== 1973 election ===
In the October 29, 1973 election, after campaigning under the name Parti créditiste, only two party members won election to the National Assembly, Fabien Roy and Camil Samson, although the party won 9.9% of the popular vote.

On December 1, 1974, Armand Bois announced the foundation of a new créditiste party, the Parti réformateur. That party merged with the Ralliement créditiste on November 18, 1975.

Before the 1976 election, there was a further split as the only two sitting Parti créditiste MNAs went their separate ways. Camil Samson became leader of the party, again called the Ralliement créditiste du Québec, on May 11, 1975. Fabien Roy was expelled from the party. It is not clear whether Roy was expelled on January 15, 1974 or November 3, 1975.

On December 14, 1975, Roy teamed up with former Liberal Jérôme Choquette to form the Parti national populaire under Choquette&#x27;s leadership. The PNP and the Union Nationale, led by Rodrigue Biron, announced the merger of their two parties, but the idea was abandoned by the Union Nationale one month later.

=== 1976 election ===
In the November 15, 1976 general election, Camil Samson was the only créditiste elected, although the party won 4.63% of the popular vote across the province. (The PNP&#x27;s Roy also won his seat, while Choquette was defeated.)

Samson&#x27;s strong oratorical ability and sense of humour pleased the crowds who attended his rallies, and the party spent $150,000 on 15-minute television advertisements that aired almost every day&quot;, but his inability to get along with his colleagues had decimated Creditiste ranks over the years, and left the party largely composed of his own supporters who had followed him “through thick and thin”. Samson promised interest-free loans and a guaranteed annual income, and emphasised traditional social credit themes including the rejection of socialism and the plight of the common man.”

Some traditional Creditistes such as Carl O’Malley had followed Fabien Roy into the Parti Nationale Populaire (O’Malley was the PNP candidate in Notre-Dame-de-Grace riding) even through the PNP did not embrace social credit.

Samson was re-elected with 9011 votes (40%) in his riding of Rouyn-Noranda.

=== Dissolution ===
The Ralliement créditiste du Québec was dissolved as Camil Samson founded a new party, Les Démocrates, on November 12, 1978. Samson’s partner in establishing the new party was Pierre Sévigny, a federal cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of John Diefenbaker. Sévigny had resigned from the federal cabinet in disgrace because of his relationship with Gerda Munsinger, who was later revealed to be a spy for East Germany.
That party was renamed the Parti démocrate créditiste on January 1, 1980; on September 2, 1980, Samson joined the Quebec Liberal Party caucus, and the Parti démocrate créditiste was dissolved. Samson was defeated as a Liberal candidate in the 1981 provincial election.

<doc id="572427" wikidata="Q26046" url="?curid=572427" title="European pine marten">
<text>The European pine marten (Martes martes), also known as the pine marten, is a mustelid native to and widespread in most of Europe, Asia Minor, the Caucasus and parts of Iran, Iraq and Syria. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.
It is less commonly also known as baum marten or sweet marten. 

==Description==

The European pine marten&#x27;s fur is usually light to dark brown. It is short and coarse in the summer, growing longer and silkier during the winter. It has a cream- to yellow-coloured &quot;bib&quot; marking on its throat. Its body is up to long, with a bushy tail of about . It weighs around ; males are slightly larger than females. It has excellent senses of sight, smell, and hearing.

== Distribution and habitat ==
===Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales===

The European pine marten was for many years common only in northwestern Scotland. A study in 2012 found that it has spread from the Scottish Highlands north into Sutherland and Caithness and southeastwards from the Great Glen into Moray, Aberdeenshire, Perthshire, Tayside, and Stirlingshire, with some in the Central Belt, on the Kintyre and Cowal peninsulas and on Skye and Mull. The expansion in the Galloway Forest has been limited compared with that in the core marten range. Martens were reintroduced to the Glen Trool Forest in the early 1980s and only restricted spread has occurred from there.

In England, the European pine marten was considered to be extinct. Analysis of a scat found at Kidland Forest in Northumberland in June 2010 may represent either a recolonisation from Scotland, or a relict population that has escaped notice previously.
There have been numerous reported sightings of European pine martens in Cumbria; however, only in 2011, scat was found and DNA-tested, followed in October 2022 by images of a European pine marten in Grizedale Forest. 

In July 2015, the first confirmed sighting of a European pine marten in England for over a century was recorded by an amateur photographer in the woodlands of Shropshire. Sightings have continued in the area and juveniles were recorded in 2019, indicating a breeding population. In July 2017, footage of a live European pine marten was captured by a camera trap in the North York Moors in Yorkshire; in March 2018, the first ever footage of a European pine marten in Northumberland was captured by the Back from the Brink pine marten project.

The European pine marten&#x27;s presence in Southern England&#x27;s New Forest was confirmed in 2021, and they are now breeding there. In September 2022, the first European pine marten to be seen in London in a century was spotted by the Zoological Society of London&#x27;s wildlife cameras as part of a hedgehog monitoring program. The Kent Wildlife Trust in collaboration with the Sussex Wildlife Trust announced a project in February 2024 to assess the feasibility of reintroducing European pine martens to South East England.

There is a small population of the European pine marten in Wales. Scat found in Cwm Rheidol forest in 2007 was confirmed by DNA testing to be from a European pine marten. A male was found in 2012 as road kill near Newtown, Powys. This was the first confirmation in Wales of the species, living or dead, since 1971. The Vincent Wildlife Trust (VWT) has begun a reinforcement of these mammals in the mid-Wales area. During autumn 2015, 20 European pine martens were captured in Scotland, in areas where a healthy European pine marten population occurs, under licence from Scottish Natural Heritage. These individuals were translocated and released in an area of mid-Wales. All of the martens were fitted with radio collars and are being tracked daily to monitor their movements and find out where they have set up territories. During autumn 2016, the VWT planned to capture and release another 20 European pine martens in the hope of creating a self-sustaining population. Following the success of these projects, 35 European pine martens were reintroduced between 2019 and 2021 to the Forest of Dean in South West England where they were last seen in 1860, with the hope that in time they will merge with the growing population in Wales to form a contiguous presence. After successful breeding every year, by 2023 their numbers were estimated to be approaching 60.

The European pine marten is still quite rare in Ireland, but the population is recovering and spreading; its traditional strongholds are in the west and south, especially the Burren and Killarney National Park, but the population in the Midlands has significantly increased in recent years. A study managed by academics at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, using cameras and citizen scientists, published in 2015, showed that European pine martens were distributed across all counties of Northern Ireland. Their reintroduction has been controversial.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The European pine marten is the only mustelid with semiretractable claws. This enables them to lead more arboreal lifestyles, such as climbing or running on tree branches, although they are also relatively quick runners on the ground. They are mainly active at night and dusk. They have small, rounded, highly sensitive ears and sharp teeth adapted for eating small mammals, birds, insects, frogs, and carrion. They have also been known to eat berries, fruits, birds&#x27; eggs, nuts, and honey. The European pine marten is territorial and marks its home range by depositing feces. Its scat is black and twisted.

The recovery of the European pine marten in Ireland has been credited with reducing the population of invasive grey squirrels. Where the range of the expanding European pine marten population meets that of the grey squirrel, the population of the grey squirrels quickly retreats and the red squirrel population recovers. Because the grey squirrel spends more time on the ground than the red squirrel, which co-evolved with the pine marten, they are thought to be far more likely to come in contact with this predator.

===Lifespan===
The European pine marten has lived to 18 years in captivity, but the maximum age recorded in the wild is only 11 years, with 3–4 years being more typical. They reach sexual maturity at 2–3 years of age. Copulation usually occurs on the ground and can last more than 1 hour. Mating occurs in July and August but the fertilized egg does not enter the uterus for about 7 months. The young are usually born in late March or early April after a month-long gestation period that happens after the implantation of the fertilized egg, in litters of one to five. Young European pine martens weigh around at birth. The young begin to emerge from their dens around 7–8 weeks after birth and are able to disperse from the den around 12–16 weeks after their birth.
===Predators===
Larger mammalian predators and birds of prey such as Eurasian lynx, wolverine, red fox, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, northern goshawk and Eurasian eagle owl prey on European pine martens, especially young individuals.

==Threats==
Humans are the greatest threat to the European pine marten. They are vulnerable to conflict with humans, arising from predator control for other species, or following predation of livestock and the use of inhabited buildings for denning. Martens may also be affected by woodland loss, which results in habitat loss for the animal. Persecution (illegal poisoning and shooting), loss of habitat leading to fragmentation, and other human disturbances have caused a considerable decline in the European pine marten population. In some areas, they are also prized for their very fine fur. In the UK, European pine martens and their dens are offered full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

== In culture ==
The European pine marten is one of the national symbols of Croatia and appears on the Croatian euro coins. Previously, the European pine marten appeared on the obverse side of the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 25-Croatian kuna, the word &quot;kuna&quot; meaning &quot;marten&quot; in Croatian.

<text>The first USS &quot;Minneapolis&quot; (C-13/CA-17) was a United States Navy protected cruiser. She was named for the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

&quot;Minneapolis&quot; was laid down 16 December 1891 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia; launched 12 August 1893, sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Washburn, daughter of Senator William D. Washburn of Minnesota; and commissioned at Philadelphia, 13 December 1894, Captain George H. Wadleigh, in command. The class was originally designed with three funnels; however, &quot;Columbia&quot; was built with four and &quot;Minneapolis&quot; with two. This may have been to make them resemble specific passenger liners.

== Early duties ==
Assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron, the new cruiser took part in maneuvers and cruises along the eastern seaboard and in the West Indies until she was assigned to the European Squadron 27 November 1895, arriving Gibraltar, 13 December. After cruising in the Mediterranean Sea, she visited Kronstadt, Russia, 13 May to 19 June, as flagship of Rear Admiral Thomas O. Selfridge Jr., representing the United States at the coronation of Czar Nicholas II. Following visits to principal ports of northern Europe, she returned to Turkey and Greece. She departed Gibraltar 21 June 1897 and arrived at Philadelphia 6 July. The next day, she was placed in reserve at League Island Navy Yard, Philadelphia.

== Spanish–American War ==
Upon outbreak of the Spanish–American War, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; was assigned to the Northern Patrol Squadron operating along the north Atlantic coast of the United States. In April 1898, she was dispatched for scouting duty in the West Indies, searching for Admiral Cervera&#x27;s fleet as far as the coast of Venezuela, and returning to Santiago de Cuba, 19 May 1898, en route to Key West, Florida.

== Peace time duties ==
She decommissioned at Philadelphia 18 August 1898 and remained in ordinary in League Island Navy Yard until recommissioned as a receiving ship, 23 April 1902. She again decommissioned at League Island Navy Yard, Philadelphia, 2 June 1903 and recommissioned 5 October 1903. She took part in the Louisiana Purchase Celebration at New Orleans, Louisiana from 16 to 28 December, and spent much of the next year cruising the West Indies.

&quot;Minneapolis&quot; arrived New London, Connecticut 23 May 1905 to participate in the unveiling of the John Winthrop Monument, then was assigned to a Special Service Squadron with collier and screw steamer , under the command of Rear Admiral Colby Mitchell Chester, to make astronomical and other scientific observations off the coast of Spain and Africa.

She sailed from New York 3 July 1905 and arrived at Gibraltar on the 17th, carrying scientists to observe the solar eclipse, 30 August 1905. She departed the Mediterranean 10 November 1905 and sailed via France and England to the United States arriving Hampton Roads, 23 December.

She was at Annapolis, Maryland, 20 April to 5 May 1906, for ceremonies commemorating the arrival of the body of John Paul Jones, and, after taking midshipmen on a practice cruise, conducted training cruises for men of the naval militias of New York and Connecticut. She decommissioned at Philadelphia on 7 November 1906 and remained in ordinary until the United States entered World War I.

== World War I ==
Recommissioned 2 July 1917, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; got underway from Philadelphia 15 September for Hampton Roads, and departed that base 26 October for Colon, Panama Canal Zone, where she joined British transports &quot;Arawa&quot; and &quot;Corinthia&quot;. The vessels sailed from Colon 6 November and steamed by way of Hampton Roads to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The cruiser continued to operate along the Atlantic coast until assigned to transatlantic convoy duty 24 February 1918. During the next 8 months, she made four escort voyages, departing New York and sailing to ocean rendezvous where the convoys were turned over to British destroyers. On her last voyage, she departed New York on 9 October as escort for a convoy to Sydney, Nova Scotia, and returned to New York, 19 October.

== Post war and final decommissioning ==
&quot;Minneapolis&quot; was then assigned to the Pacific Station as flagship, arriving in San Diego, California on 7 February 1919. She was decommissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard two years later, on 15 March 1921, and sold on 5 August 1921. Her mast is preserved on the northeastern shore of Bde Maka Ska near the Lake Street boat launch in Uptown, Minneapolis (). The bell is currently in use at Minnetonka High School.

<text>Bosnian pot (Bosanski lonac) is a Bosnian stew, a culinary speciality, appreciated for its rich taste and flexibility. Recipes for Bosanski lonac vary greatly according to personal and regional preference, but the main ingredients generally include chunked meat and vegetables. Mixed meats may be used in the dish. It has been described as a national dish of Bosnia.

Bosanski lonac has been on the tables of both the rich and the poor for hundreds of years. The wealthy prepared the dish with more meat and other expensive ingredients, while the poor used what was available. Typical ingredients are beef, lamb, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, parsley, garlic, and peppercorns (whole, not ground). Many different vegetables or meats may be used. Bosanski lonac is prepared by layering meat and vegetables (alternating layers of meat and vegetables until the pot is full) into a deep pot, then adding 1-2 dl water. The ingredients are usually cut into large pieces rather than finely chopped or minced.

Originally, Bosanski lonac was made in ceramic pots and cooked in a fireplace or pit in the ground. Today, with the declining availability of fireplaces for cooking, many cooks use a regular pot and a kitchen stove.

<text>Lee Strasberg (born Israel Strassberg; November 17, 1901 – February 17, 1982) was an American acting coach and actor. He co-founded, with theatre directors Harold Clurman and Cheryl Crawford, the Group Theatre in 1931, which was hailed as &quot;America&#x27;s first true theatrical collective&quot;. In 1951, he became director of the nonprofit Actors Studio in New York City, considered &quot;the nation&#x27;s most prestigious acting school,&quot; and, in 1966, he was involved in the creation of Actors Studio West in Los Angeles.

Although other highly regarded teachers also developed versions of &quot;The Method,&quot; Lee Strasberg is considered to be the &quot;father of method acting in America,&quot; according to author Mel Gussow. From the 1920s until his death in 1982, &quot;he revolutionized the art of acting by having a profound influence on performance in American theater and film.&quot; From his base in New York, Strasberg trained several generations of theatre and film notables, including Anne Bancroft, Dustin Hoffman, Montgomery Clift, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, Jane Fonda, Julie Harris, Paul Newman, Ellen Burstyn, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Sally Field, Renee Taylor, Geraldine Page, Eli Wallach, and directors Andreas Voutsinas, Frank Perry, Elia Kazan and Michael Cimino.

By 1970, Strasberg had become less involved with the Actors Studio and, with his third wife, Anna Strasberg, opened the Lee Strasberg Theatre &amp; Film Institute with branches in New York City and in Hollywood, to continue teaching the &#x27;system&#x27; of Konstantin Stanislavski, which he had interpreted and developed, particularly in light of the ideas of Yevgeny Vakhtangov, for contemporary actors. 

As an actor, Strasberg is best known for his portrayal of the primary antagonist, the gangster Hyman Roth, alongside his former student Al Pacino in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), a role he took at Pacino&#x27;s suggestion after Kazan turned down the role, and which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also appeared in &quot;Going in Style&quot; (1979) and &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1979).

== Early years ==
Lee Strasberg was born Israel Strassberg in Budzanów in Austrian Poland (part of Austria-Hungary, now in Ukraine), to Jewish parents, Baruch Meyer Strassberg and his wife, Ida (born Chaia), née Diner, and was the youngest of three sons. His father emigrated to New York while his family remained in their home village with an uncle, a rabbinical teacher. His father, who worked as a presser in the garment industry, sent first for his eldest son and his daughter. Finally, enough money was saved to bring over his wife and his two remaining sons. In 1909 the family was reunited on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, where they lived until the early 1920s. Young Strasberg took refuge in voracious reading and the companionship of his older brother, Zalmon, whose death in the 1918 influenza pandemic was so traumatic for the young Strasberg that, despite being a straight-A student, he dropped out of high school.

A relative introduced him to the theatre by giving him a small part in a Yiddish-language production being performed by the Progressive Drama Club. He later joined the Chrystie Street Settlement House&#x27;s drama club. Philip Loeb, casting director of the Theater Guild, sensed that Strasberg could act, although he was not yet thinking of a full-time acting career and was still working as a shipping clerk and bookkeeper for a wig company. When he was 23 years old, he enrolled in the Clare Tree Major School of the Theater. He became a naturalized United States citizen on January 16, 1939, in New York City at the New York Southern District Court.

== Encounter with Stanislavski ==
Kazan biographer Richard Schickel described Strasberg&#x27;s first experiences with the art of acting:
Strasberg eventually left the Clare Tree Major School to study with students of Stanislavski — Maria Ouspenskaya and Richard Boleslawski — at the American Laboratory Theatre. In 1925, Strasberg had his first professional appearance in &quot;Processional&quot;, a play produced by the Theater Guild.

According to Schickel:
== Acting director and teacher ==
=== Group Theater ===
He gained a reputation with the Theater Guild of New York and helped form the Group Theater in New York in 1931. There, he created a technique that became known as &quot;The Method&quot; or &quot;Method Acting&quot;. His teaching style owed much to the Russian practitioner, Konstantin Stanislavski, whose book, &quot;An Actor Prepares&quot; (published in English in 1936), dealt with the psychology of acting. He began by directing, but his time was gradually taken up by the training of actors. Called &quot;America&#x27;s first true theatrical collective,&quot; the Group Theater immediately offered a few tuition-free scholarships for its three-year program to &quot;promising students.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;The Group Theatre ... with its self-defined mission to reconnect theater to the world of ideas and actions, staged plays that confronted social and moral issues ... with members Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg, Stella, and Luther Adler, Clifford Odets, Elia Kazan, and an ill-assorted band of idealistic actors living hand to mouth are seen welded in a collective of creativity that was also a tangle of jealousies, love affairs, and explosive feuds.&quot; Playwright Arthur Miller said, &quot;the Group Theatre was unique and probably will never be repeated. For a while it was literally the voice of Depression America.&quot; Co-founder Harold Clurman, in describing what Strasberg brought to the Group Theater, wrote:
Strasberg, Kazan, Clurman, and others with the Group Theater spent the summer of 1936 at Pine Brook Country Club, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut. They spent previous summers at various places in upstate New York and near Danbury, Connecticut.

Amid internecine tensions, Strasberg resigned as director of the Group Theatre in March 1937.

=== Actors Studio ===
In 1947, Elia Kazan, Robert Lewis, and Cheryl Crawford, also members of the Group Theatre, started the Actors Studio as a nonprofit workshop for professional and aspiring actors to concentrate on their craft away from the pressures of the commercial theatre. Strasberg assumed leadership of the studio in 1951 as its artistic director. &quot;As a teacher and acting theorist, he revolutionized American actor training and engaged such remarkable performers as Kim Hunter, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Harris, Paul Newman, Geraldine Page, Ellen Burstyn, and Al Pacino.&quot; Since its inception, the Studio has been a nonprofit educational corporation chartered by the state of New York, and has been supported entirely by contributions and benefits. &quot;We have here the possibility of creating a kind of theatre that would be a shining medal for our country,&quot; Strasberg said in 1959. UCLA acting teacher Robert Hethmon writes, &quot;The Actors Studio is a refuge. Its privacy is guarded ferociously against the casual intruder, the seeker of curiousities, and the exploiter... The Studio helps actors to meet the enemy within... and contributes greatly to Strasberg&#x27;s utterly pragmatic views on training the actor and solving his problems... [The Studio] is kept deliberately modest in its circumstances, its essence being the private room where Lee Strasberg and some talented actors can work.&quot;

Strasberg wrote, &quot;At the studio, we do not sit around and feed each other&#x27;s egos. People are shocked how severe we are on each other.&quot; Admission to the Actors Studio was usually by audition with more than a thousand actors auditioning each year and the directors usually conferring membership on only five or six. &quot;The Studio was, and is &quot;sui generis&quot;,&quot; said Elia Kazan, proudly. Beginning in a small, private way, with a strictly off-limits-to-outsiders policy, the Studio quickly earned a high reputation in theatre circles. &quot;It became the place to be, the forum where all the most promising and unconventional young actors were being cultivated by sharp young directors.&quot; Actors who have worked at the studio include Julie Harris, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Geraldine Page, Maureen Stapleton, Anne Bancroft, Dustin Hoffman, Patricia Neal, Rod Steiger, Mildred Dunnock, Eva Marie Saint, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Ben Gazzara, Sidney Poitier, Karl Malden, Gene Wilder, Shelley Winters, Dennis Hopper, and Sally Field.

The Emmy Award-winning author of &quot;Inside Inside&quot;, James Lipton, writes that the Actors Studio became &quot;one of the most prestigious institutions in the world&quot; as a result of its desire to set a higher &quot;standard&quot; in acting. The founders, including Strasberg, demanded total commitment and extreme talent from aspiring students. Jack Nicholson auditioned five times before he was accepted; Dustin Hoffman, six times; and Harvey Keitel, 11 times. After each rejection, a candidate had to wait as long as a year to try again. Martin Landau and Steve McQueen were the only two students admitted one year, out of 2000 candidates who auditioned.
* Al Pacino: &quot;The Actors Studio meant so much to me in my life. Lee Strasberg hasn&#x27;t been given the credit he deserves. Brando doesn&#x27;t give Lee any credit... Next to Charlie Laughton (an acting teacher at HB Studio, and not to be confused with English actor Charles Laughton), it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting.&quot;
* Marlon Brando: Movie stars spawned by Strasberg&#x27;s Actors Studio were of a new type that is often labeled the &quot;rebel hero,&quot; wrote Pamela Wojcik. Historian Sam Staggs writes that &quot;Marlon Brando was the hot, sleek engine on the Actors Studio express,&quot; and called him &quot;[the] embodiment of method acting,&quot; but Brando was trained primarily by Stella Adler, a former member of the Group Theatre, who had a falling out with Strasberg over his interpretations of Stanislavsky&#x27;s ideas.&quot; He based his acting technique on the method, once stating, &quot;It made me a real actor. The idea is you learn to use everything that happened in your life and you learn to use it in creating the character you&#x27;re working on. You learn how to dig into your unconscious and make use of every experience you&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; In Brando&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot;, the actor claimed he learned nothing from Strasberg: &quot;After I had some success, Lee Strasberg tried to take credit for teaching me how to act. He never taught me anything. He would have claimed credit for the sun and the moon if he believed he could get away with it. He tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru. Some people worshiped him, and I never knew why. I sometimes went to the Actors Studio on Saturday mornings because Elia Kazan was teaching, and there were usually a lot of good-looking girls there, but Strasberg never taught me acting. Stella did—and later Kazan.&quot;

* James Dean: According to James Dean biographer W. Bast, &quot;Proud of this accomplishment, Dean referred to the studio in a 1952 letter, when he was 21 years old, to his family as &#x27;The greatest school of the theater. It houses great people like Marlon Brando, Julie Harris, Arthur Kennedy, Mildred Dunnock. ... Very few get into it. ... It&#x27;s the best thing that can happen to an actor. I&#x27;m one of the youngest to belong.&#x27;&quot;
* Marilyn Monroe: Film author Maurice Zolotow wrote: &quot;Between &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; and &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; only four years elapsed, but her world had changed. She had become one of the most celebrated personalities in the world. She had divorced Joe DiMaggio. She had married Arthur Miller. She had become a disciple of Lee Strasberg. She was seriously studying acting. She was reading good books.&quot;
* Tennessee Williams: Tennessee Williams&#x27; plays have been populated by graduates of the studio, where he felt, &quot;studio actors had a more intense and honest style of acting.&quot; He wrote, &quot;They act from the inside out. They communicate emotions they really feel. They give you a sense of life.&quot; Williams was a co-founder of the group and a key member of its playwright&#x27;s wing; he later wrote &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, Brando&#x27;s greatest early role.
* Jane Fonda: Jane Fonda recalled that at the age of 5, her brother, actor Peter Fonda, and she acted out Western stories similar to those her father, Henry Fonda, played in the movies. She attended Vassar College and went to Paris for two years to study art. Upon returning, she met Lee Strasberg and the meeting changed the course of her life, Fonda saying, &quot;I went to the Actors Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father—who had to say so—told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!&quot;

== Teaching methods and philosophy ==
In describing his teaching philosophy, Strasberg wrote, &quot;The two areas of discovery that were of primary importance in my work at the Actors Studio and in my private classes were improvisation and affective memory. It is finally by using these techniques that the actor can express the appropriate emotions demanded of the character.&quot; Strasberg demanded great discipline of his actors, as well as great depths of psychological truthfulness. He once explained his approach in this way:
According to film critic and author Mel Gussow, Strasberg required that an actor, when preparing for a role, delve not only into the character&#x27;s life in the play but also, &quot;Far more importantly, into the character&#x27;s life before the curtain rises. In rehearsal, the character&#x27;s prehistory, perhaps going back to childhood, is discussed and even acted out. The play became the climax of the character&#x27;s existence.&quot;

=== Elia Kazan as student ===
In Elia Kazan&#x27;s autobiography, the Academy Award–winning director wrote about his earliest memories of Strasberg as teacher:
=== Classroom settings ===
Kazan described the classes taught by Strasberg:
==== James Dean ====

In 1955 Strasberg student James Dean died in a car accident, at age 24. Strasberg, during a regular lecture shortly after this accident, discussed Dean. The following are excerpts from a transcription of his recorded lecture:

==== On Marilyn Monroe ====
In 1962, Marilyn Monroe died at age 36. At the time of her death, she was at the height of her career. In 1999, she was ranked the sixth-greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema by the American Film Institute. Lee Strasberg gave the eulogy at her funeral.
== Personal life ==
Lee Strasberg&#x27;s first marriage was to Nora Krecaum from October 29, 1926, until her death three years later in 1929. In 1934, he married actress and drama coach Paula Miller (1909–1966) until her death from cancer in 1966. Lee and Paula were the parents of actress Susan Strasberg (1938–1999) and acting teacher John Strasberg (born 1941). His third wife was the former Anna Mizrahi (born April 16, 1939) and the mother of his two youngest children, Adam Lee Strasberg (born July 29, 1969) and David Lee Israel Strasberg (born January 30, 1971).

== Death and commemoration ==

Lee Strasberg suffered a fatal heart attack on February 17, 1982, in New York City, aged 80. With him at the time of his death at the hospital were his third wife, Anna, and their two sons. He was interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. A day before his unexpected death, he was officially notified that he had been elected to the American Theater Hall of Fame. His last public appearance was on February 14, 1982, at &quot;Night of 100 Stars&quot; in the Radio City Music Hall, a benefit for the Actors Fund of America. Along with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, he danced in the chorus line with The Rockettes.

Actress Ellen Burstyn recalled that evening:
In an 80th birthday interview, he said that he was looking forward to his next 20 years in the theater. According to friends, he was healthy until the day he died. &quot;It was so unexpected,&quot; Al Pacino said. &quot;What stood out was how youthful he was. He never seemed as old as his years. He was an inspiration.&quot; Actress Jane Fonda said after hearing of his death, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure I even would have become an actress were it not for him. He will be missed, but he leaves behind a great legacy.&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Whether directly influenced by Strasberg or not,&quot; wrote acting author Pamela Wojcik, &quot;the new male stars all to some degree or other adapted method techniques to support their identification as rebels... He recreates romance as a drama of male neuroticism and also invests his characterization &#x27;with an unprecedented aura of verisimilitude.&#x27;&quot; Acting teacher and author Alison Hodge explains, &quot;Seemingly spontaneous, intuitive, brooding, &#x27;private,&#x27; lit with potent vibrations from an inner life of conflict and contradiction, their work exemplified the style of heightened naturalism which (whether Brando agrees or not) Lee Strasberg devoted his life to exploring and promoting.&quot; Pamela Wojcik adds:
In 2012, Strasberg&#x27;s family donated his library of personal papers to the Library of Congress. The papers include 240 boxes containing correspondence, rehearsal notes, photographs, theatrical drawings and posters, sketches of stage designs, and more.

Lee Strasberg, his wife Paula, his daughter Susan, and his son John, all appear as characters in Robert Brustein&#x27;s 1998 play &quot;Nobody Dies on Friday&quot;, which one critic called a &quot;scathing portrait of Strasberg,&quot; but one that &quot;can by no means be dismissed as a simple act of character assassination.&quot; Brustein, a critic, director, and producer, had previously made public his dislike of the method as a philosophy of acting. The play was produced by Brustein&#x27;s American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was later presented in Singapore.

Strasberg is a character in &quot;Names&quot;, Mark Kemble&#x27;s play about former Group Theatre members&#x27; struggles during the blacklist era.

In 2020, Google Arts &amp; Culture, together with Giovanni Morassutti, an Italian actor who has deepened the study of The Method and long-time collaborator of John Strasberg, have created an online exhibition named &quot;Strasberg Legacy&quot; tracing the history of the realistic school of acting.

<text>The Twin Towers Correctional Facility, also referred to in the media as Twin Towers Jail, is a complex in Los Angeles, California. The facility is located at 450 Bauchet Street, in Los Angeles, California and is operated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The facility consists of two towers, a medical services building, and the Los Angeles County Medical Center Jail Ward.

The 1.5 million square foot (140,000 m2) complex was opened in 1997, though it remained empty for a period prior to opening because of lack of operating funds. During that time, the deputy sheriffs had to prevent people from breaking in. It was authorized and constructed after the Northridge earthquake damaged the historic Hall of Justice in the city. Security at the facility centers on a panoptic design that allows deputies and officers in a central control room to look through secure optical material to see into all areas of the facility.

==Concerns==
Despite the state-of-the-art security systems built into the jail, inmate Kevin Jerome Pullum walked out of an employee exit on July 6, 2001, two hours after being convicted of attempted murder, and remained at large for eighteen days before he was apprehended within a mile of the jail. Pullum used a newspaper photograph of actor Eddie Murphy to alter an identification badge he used in the escape. The attempt made Pullum the 13th person to successfully escape the facility.

In May 2013, along with the adjacent Men&#x27;s Central Jail, Twin Towers ranked as one of the ten worst County Jails in the United States, based on reporting in &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, which noted the large number of complaints received by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). &quot;Mother Jones&quot; described the facility as &quot;overflowing&quot; and the deputies as prone to attacking inmates &quot;unprovoked&quot; or for &quot;the slightest infractions&quot;. They report an allegation that one inmate injured in an attack by multiple deputies was marched down a jail module as one deputy yelled &quot;gay boy walking&quot; and then beaten and raped by other inmates as deputies watched.

The jail has also come under fire from human rights advocates as a central focus in the use of psychiatric drugs to control prisoners.

==Notable inmates==
*The Game, rapper
*Freddie Gibbs, rapper
*Paris Hilton, reality TV personality. Was in jail for a few weeks.
*Danny Masterson, former actor
*Conrad Murray, Michael Jackson&#x27;s personal doctor
*Ron Jeremy, pornographic actor
*Steve-O, Jackass cast member
*Johnny &quot;J&quot;, rap producer
*Robert Durst, real estate heir and killer, extradited to California to face murder charge for killing best friend Susan Berman
* Harvey Weinstein, former film producer extradited from New York to face his sexual assault trials

==Cultural references==
The facility has been used as a filming location for the movies &quot;Blast&quot; and &quot;Mean Guns&quot;, both directed by Albert Pyun. It also features in Michael Connelly&#x27;s book &quot;The Law of Innocence&quot;.

It is mentioned many times in the cop show &quot;The Rookie&quot; as a location of where many criminals go.

<text>tribe.net (often shortened to &quot;tribe&quot;) was a website that hosted an online community, or tribe of friends, similar to other social networking sites. The site name was always spelled in all lower case. As of February 2017 the site content was inaccessible and the site lacked a host. As of 25 February 2023, the tribe.net domain hosts a Mastodon server.

==History==
Tribe was founded in early 2003 by Paul Martino, Mark Pincus, and Valerie Syme. As of March 2004, the population of tribe was skewed heavily towards people living in the San Francisco Bay Area, though the geographic distribution is gradually normalizing as people from other places join. As of September 2006 it had over 500,000 members.

In a controversial move, on December 20, 2005, tribe.net decided to prohibit sexually explicit content, partially in response to the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act. This move disappointed many users, as Tribe to that point had been notable for a permissive content policy.

On January 19, 2006, tribe.net changed its layout and user interface (UI). The management of tribe.net claimed that they received approximately 40% positive feedback during a small beta phase with 3000 users.

In April, 2006, most of the employees of Tribe.net were laid off, leaving only a skeleton group to maintain and develop the site.

On August 24, 2006, former CEO Mark Pincus announced that he was &quot;taking back tribe.&quot; He did this through a public listing on the site. This happened due to the financial insolvency of the initial company. Mark formed a new corporation, Utah Street Networks, that bought the distressed assets of the original company, Tribe Networks.

In late 2007, at the request of many members , tribe.net announced that it would offer a premium service to members on a subscription basis, at the rate of US$5.00 per month. Prospective premium members were told that they would be able to view the website in an ad-free format. It also promised free T-shirts to annual members, a benefit that has never fully been disbursed.

A September 24, 2008 article in the &quot;San Francisco Weekly&quot; quoted Pincus as saying that the site would continue. &quot;I feel a commitment to the community of people who have made the decision to post themselves on Tribe,&quot; the Weekly quoted Pincus. &quot;We&#x27;ve kept Tribe going not because we believed it would turn into a phenomenal business success like Bebo or Facebook, but because I think it serves a really valuable role for the community.&quot;
tribe.net was taken offline in March 2017 after an article on Heavy.com about a Reddit thread described child porn activity on the network.

While development director Carolyn Anhalt told the &quot;Black Rock Beacon&quot; in 2017 that the site was “gone for good” she said the concept might be resurrected. “We have not completely given up the hope to have a sustainable social network that supports anonymity and free speech.&quot;

In February 2022, the domain name was pointed to a list of charities supporting Ukraine. In November 2022, a new Mastodon (software) server was brought up under the tribe.net domain name, https://tribe.net/about.

==Features==
Anyone could register as a new tribe user, and then define their immediate network of friends, either by choosing from existing members or by inviting new members to join. Each of these users may in turn define their own network of friends. (This process results in a type of user-driven viral marketing on behalf of tribe.net.) As more and more people and their friends joined tribe, it resulted in an elaborate computerized social network with many thousands of members. tribe users leveraged the small world phenomenon as a way to enhance their own immediate network.

tribe.net features many &quot;tribes&quot;, loosely based on the theory of urban tribes propounded by Michel Maffesoli and Ethan Watters. In practice, these tribes are a kind of topical forum. A new tribe may be created by any registered user. When a user creates a new tribe, that user is the moderator of the tribe. Any user may in principle join any tribe, although some tribes are private or require permission from the moderator to join. In addition to threaded messages, members can use tribes to post photos, announce upcoming parties, concerts, or other events easily and reach select audiences. Currently there are thousands of tribes, with more added daily.

Tribe content fell into several different categories: Topics (discussion threads), photos (uploaded by users), listings (classified ads), events (scheduled happenings), reviews (of websites), requests (more classified ads), and olx (link to OLX, a separate website of classified ads).

==Ownership==
Tribe Networks, the original company behind tribe.net, was formerly privately owned, financed largely with venture capital. Tribe partnered with the Washington Post and Knight Ridder. In 2006, a new company called Utah Street Networks was formed to buy the assets of Tribe Networks and continue operation of the site. This transition was largely transparent to the users of the site, but largely coincides with the &quot;taking back Tribe&quot; message posted by Mr. Pincus.

In March 2007, Cisco Systems announced their acquisition of Tribe Networks&#x27; technology assets.

In November 2008, Utah Street turned over management of tribe to New Systems Associates, a group of users who planned to stabilize the site and expand its services. New Systems attempted to rewrite the Tribe software so that it would no longer need to license it from Cisco. Once that was complete, Pincus was to transfer the assets to New Systems, Carolyn Anhalt, the company’s director of development and technical support, told the Black Rock Beacon in 2015.

In 2010, the combination of a dispute with contract programmers and the loss of advertising from a major server that objected to pornographic content on the site derailed the rewrite. The site suffered from spotty service as its software became increasingly incompatible with current technology.

<doc id="572447" wikidata="Q2599083" url="?curid=572447" title="IAE V2500">
<text>The IAE V2500 is a two-shaft high-bypass turbofan engine built by International Aero Engines (IAE) which powers the Airbus A320 family, the McDonnell Douglas MD-90, and the Embraer C-390 Millennium.

The engine&#x27;s name is a combination of the Roman numeral &quot;V&quot;, symbolizing the five original members of the International Aero Engines consortium, formed in 1983 to produce the engine, and &quot;2500&quot;, which represents the thrust produced by the original engine model, the V2500-A1. FAA type certification for the V2500 was granted in 1988.

The maintenance, repair, and operations market for the V2500 is close to as of 2015.

==Development==
Rolls-Royce based the ten-stage high-pressure compressor on an eight-stage run in the RB401 in the mid 1970&#x27;s followed by a nine-stage run in the RJ.500. The V.2500 would use ten stages, with the first four with variable stators, giving a pressure ratio of 20:1. A single-stage booster was also part of the original configuration. Serious handling problems (inability to accelerate without surging) with this arrangement resulted in a redesigned compression system. The pressure ratio was reduced to 16:1 which needed a fifth variable stage and revised blading in the rear stages. Two extra booster stages were required to restore the original overall pressure ratio. A fourth booster stage would be added after the initial variant entered service. Pratt &amp; Whitney developed the combustor and the two-stage air-cooled high-pressure turbine, while the Japanese Aero Engine Corporation provided the low-pressure compression system. MTU Aero Engines were responsible for the five-stage low-pressure turbine and Fiat Avio designed the gearbox.

In 1989, its unit cost was US$ million. The 4,000th V2500 was delivered in August 2009 to the Brazilian flag carrier TAM and installed on the 4,000th Airbus A320 family aircraft, an A319. In early 2012, the 5,000th V2500 engine was delivered to SilkAir, and IAE achieved 100 million flying hours. Six years later, in June 2018, over 7,600 engines were delivered and the V2500 achieved 200 million flight hours on 3,100 aircraft in service.

==Variants==
===V2500-A1===
The original version, has one fan stage, three low- and ten high-pressure compression stages, and two high- and five low-pressure turbine stages. This engine promised better fuel burn on the Airbus A320 than the competing CFM56-5A; however, initial reliability issues, coupled with insufficient thrust for the larger A321, prompted the development of the improved V2500-A5 variant. It first entered service with Cyprus Airways.

===V2500-A5===
A fourth booster stage was introduced into the engine basic configuration to increase core flow. This, together with a minor fan diameter and airflow increase, helped to increase the maximum thrust to 33,000 lbf (147 kN) thrust, to meet the requirements of the larger Airbus A321. Soon, Airbus offered derated versions of the V2500-A5 on the Airbus A319 and Airbus A320, enabling the same engine hardware to be used across all Airbus A320 family aircraft, with the exception of the Airbus A318. The vast majority of V2500s are of the A5 variety.

===V2500-D5===
This engine retains the configuration of the V2500-A5 but is fitted with different mounting hardware and accessory gearboxes to facilitate installation on the McDonnell Douglas MD-90.

===V2500-E5===
This engine retains the configuration of the V2500-A5 but is fitted with different mounting hardware and accessory gearboxes to facilitate installation on the Embraer KC-390.

===De-rated and increased-thrust variants===
A number of de-rated engines compliant with Stage 4 noise regulations have been produced from the -A5 configuration, as well as two variants with significant increase in thrust, thus expanding the thrust range from 23,500 lbf to 33,000 lbf:
* The thrust &quot;V2524-A5&quot; for the Airbus A319
* The thrust &quot;V2527-A5&quot; for the Airbus A320
* The thrust &quot;V2525-D5&quot; for the McDonnell Douglas MD-90-30. Engine accessories are mounted on the side instead of bottom to accommodate lateral mounting. Also has an option in the cockpit to add 3,000 pounds (13 kN) additional thrust for &quot;hot and high&quot; conditions
* The thrust &quot;V2533-A5&quot; for the Airbus A321
* The thrust &quot;V2531-E5&quot; for the Embraer C-390 Millennium

===V2500SelectOne===
On October 10, 2005, IAE announced the launch of the V2500Select—later called V2500SelectOne—with a sale to IndiGo Airlines to power 100 A320-series aircraft. The V2500SelectOne is a combination performance improvement package and aftermarket agreement. In February 2009, Pratt &amp; Whitney upgraded the first V2500-A5 to the SelectOne Retrofit standard; the engine was owned by US Airways and had been in use since 1998.

===V2500SelectTwo===
On March 15, 2011, IAE announced an upgrade option of V2500 SelectOne Engines to the SelectTwo Program. It offers reduced fuel consumption due to a software upgrade and Reduced Ground Idle (RGI), and is available since 2014 for the V2500-A5 variants.

==Applications==

* Embraer KC-390
* McDonnell Douglas MD-90

==Specifications==

* Rotor speed: low pressure: 5,650 RPM, high pressure: 14,950 RPM

<text>Les Démocrates (in English: The Democrats) was a provincial political party in Quebec, Canada, founded by former Ralliement créditiste du Québec leader Camil Samson and former Progressive Conservative Party of Canada federal cabinet minister Pierre Sévigny on November 18, 1978. It was renamed the Parti démocrate créditiste on January 1, 1980, a reference to the social credit theory of monetary economics. Samson joined the Liberal Party of Quebec on September 2, 1980. Sévigny remained as party leader and initially campaigned prior to the 1981 Quebec election but he did not stand as a candidate himself and the party was unable to field a slate of 10 candidates and dissolved prior to the election.

Social creditors who did not follow Samson into the Liberal Party may have joined the Parti credit social uni, which was formed in 1979 as a new provincial wing of the Social Credit Party of Canada.

<doc id="572451" wikidata="Q11659363" url="?curid=572451" title="SS Saint Paul (1895)">
<text>SS &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was a trans-Atlantic ocean liner named for the capital of Minnesota.

==Construction, acquisition, and commissioning==
&quot;Saint Paul&quot; was launched on 10 April 1895 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, as a steel passenger liner. The ship later was chartered for United States Navy service as an auxiliary cruiser from her owner, International Navigation Company, by a board appointed on 12 March 1898; and commissioned on 20 April 1898 for Spanish–American War service, Captain Charles D. Sigsbee in command.

==Incident with the RMS &quot;Campania&quot;==
At about 2A.M. on January 25, 1896, the SS &quot;St. Paul&quot;, of the American line, went aground while on its way toward New York Harbor. It was alleged that the steamship had been racing the RMS &quot;Campania&quot;, a British ocean liner owned by the Cunard Line, but that fog had caused the grounding. At the time, the &quot;St. Paul&quot; and her sister ship, the &quot;St. Louis&quot;, were the largest vessels ever constructed in America, with each able to carry 320 first class passengers, 200 second class passengers, and 900 emigrants. The RMS &quot;Campania&quot; was additionally the largest and fastest passenger liner afloat at the time. No one was hurt in the incident, with approximately 265 passengers (65 first class, 75 second class, and 125 steerage passengers) from the &quot;St. Paul&quot; successfully evacuated from the ship and ferried on to New York. The &quot;St. Paul&quot;, however, remained grounded for more than a week afterwards. 

In the aftermath, both captains and their respective companies denied allegations that a race had occurred just before the grounding, despite reports to the contrary from passengers and even crew members. Vernon H. Young, a representative of the Cunard Steamship Company (of which the &quot;Campania&quot; was a part), forbade the &quot;Campania’s&quot; captain, Capt. Walker, from speaking with the media about the incident. Captain Walker had already admitted to the race, however, saying in an interview: “We sighted the &quot;St. Paul&quot; at 8:30 o’clock Friday morning, when she was fifteen miles ahead of us on the port bow. Then we both went at it as hard as we could. […] We kept on at racing speed for four hours, and finally passed her.” Similarly, a crew member from the &quot;St. Paul&quot;, Mall Master Hart, told the media plainly: “We were racing when we struck.”

At the time of the incident, the &quot;St. Paul&quot; had already been the scene of several other accidents. One of these accidents involved the death of several crewmembers on December 18, 1895 when the main steam pipe supplying one of the engines burst in two places, filling the engine room with steam and scalding 5 men to death while severely injuring 5 others, 4 of whom subsequently died.

==Service history==

===Spanish–American War===
Departing Philadelphia on 5 May 1898, &quot;Saint Paul&quot;″s first assignment was to cruise in search of Admiral Cervera&#x27;s squadron between Morant Point, Jamaica, and western Haiti. She captured the British collier &quot;Restormel&quot;—bound for Cuba with a critical cargo of Cardiff coal—on 25 May and sent her into Key West under a prize crew. She cruised off Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo Bay into mid-June, then sailed to join the force blockading San Juan, Puerto Rico.
&quot;Saint Paul&quot; arrived off San Juan on the morning of 22 June. Shortly after midday, in the second battle of San Juan, the Spanish cruiser , emerged from the harbor and, remaining under protection of shore batteries, opened fire on &quot;Saint Paul&quot; at long range without success. &quot;Isabel II&quot; was joined shortly by the destroyer , which attempted to close &quot;Saint Paul&quot; to launch torpedoes. &quot;Saint Paul&quot; took &quot;Terror&quot; under heavy fire, scoring at least one direct hit which heavily damaged the destroyer. &quot;Terror&quot; gave up the attack and returned to port, followed by &quot;Isabel II&quot;. &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was relieved by off San Juan on the 26th and made for New York to coal.

&quot;Saint Paul&quot; spent the remainder of her Spanish–American War service as a transport, operating for 48 days in July–August as a War Department vessel. She landed troops at Siboney, Cuba, and Arroyo, Puerto Rico, subsequently returning soldiers from Guantanamo Bay to New York City through 15 August. Entering the Cramp shipyard on 22 August for re-conversion to mercantile service, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was decommissioned on 2 September and returned to her owner the same day.

===Collision===
On 25 April 1908, outward bound from Southampton, England, in a late snowstorm, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was involved in a collision with the British cruiser in the Needles Channel. &quot;Gladiator&quot; foundered in shallow water with the loss of 27 crew, but &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was able to return to Southampton for repairs.

===World War I===

&quot;Saint Paul&quot; was again taken over for wartime service on 27 October 1917. Operated by the United States Shipping Board as a transport on the War Department account, she retained her merchant crew and carried a naval armed guard on board. She made twelve voyages between New York and Liverpool, England. She was transferred to the Navy account in April 1918; designated SP-1643; and overhauled at New York. Then, while being towed to her berth from dry dock on 28 April with her ballast removed, she capsized in the North River. Righted on 11 September, she was subsequently turned over to the Commandant, 3rd Naval District, on 17 October.

&quot;Saint Paul&quot; entered the New York Navy Yard the following day, but the end of World War I led to cancellation of plans to convert the ship to a troopship.

===Post-war===
Placed in temporary commission on 14 January 1919 for the purpose of fixing responsibility for her care outside the Navy Yard, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; soon began reconversion for mercantile service. Returned to her owner on 24 March 1919, &quot;Saint Paul&quot; was scrapped in Germany in 1923.

===Postage stamp===
As part of the celebrations surrounding the 1901 Pan-American Exposition a set of six commemorative postage stamps were issued. The highest value, 10 cents, shows &quot;Saint Paul&quot; under steam. While the three lowest stamps in the series include rare inverted printings, no errors are known for this issue.

<doc id="572452" wikidata="Q1378459" url="?curid=572452" title="List of English words of Chinese origin">
<text>Words of Chinese origin have entered European languages, including English. Most of these were direct loanwords from various varieties of Chinese. However, Chinese words have also entered indirectly via other languages, particularly Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese, that have all used Chinese characters at some point and contain a large number of Chinese loanwords.

== Sources ==
English words of Chinese origin usually have different characteristics, depending on precisely how the words encountered the West. Despite the increasingly widespread use of Standard Chinese—based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin—among Chinese people, English words based on Mandarin are comparatively few.

Chinese vocabulary has spread to the West by means such as:

*via missionaries who were living in China. These have heavy Latin influence due to Portuguese and Spanish missionaries.
*via sinologists who lived in China. These have heavy French influence due to the long history of French sinology.
*via the maritime trade route, e.g. tea, Amoy, cumshaw etc. Heavily influenced by the Min Nan Amoy dialect in southern seaports.
*via the early immigrants to the American West during gold rush era, e.g. chop suey. Heavily influenced by the Toisan dialect.
*via the multi-national colonization of Shanghai. Influenced by many European countries, as well as Japan.
*via the British colonization of Hong Kong, e.g. cheongsam. Heavily influenced by Cantonese.
*via modern international communication, especially after the 1970s when the People&#x27;s Republic of China reduced up travel restrictions, allowing emigration to various countries, e.g. wushu, feng shui. Heavily influenced by Mandarin.
*via Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese, often Sino-Xenic words, These languages historically borrowed large swaths of Chinese vocabulary, and wrote Chinese and their native language in Chinese characters. The pronunciation of such loanwords is not based directly on Chinese, but on the local pronunciation of Chinese loanwords in these languages, known as Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean, and Sino-Vietnamese. In addition, the individual characters were extensively used as building blocks for local neologisms with no semantic counterpart in the original Chinese, resulting in words whose relationship to the Chinese language is similar to the relationship between new Latinate words—particularly those that form a large part of the international scientific vocabulary—and Latin. Such words are excluded from the list, as they sound pretty similar to their English renderings.

Though all these following terms originated from China, the spelling of the English words depends on the direct point of contact and borrowing, as well as which transliteration scheme is typically used.

<doc id="572454" wikidata="Q4116594" url="?curid=572454" title="Ligamentum arteriosum">
<text>The ligamentum arteriosum (arterial ligament), also known as Botallo&#x27;s ligament, Harvey&#x27;s ligament, and Botallo&#x27;s duct, is a small ligament attaching the aorta to the pulmonary artery. It serves no function in adults but is the remnant of the ductus arteriosus formed within three weeks after birth.

== Structure ==
At the superior end, the ligamentum attaches to the aorta—at the final part of the aortic arch (the isthmus of aorta) or the first part of the descending aorta. On the other, inferior end, the ligamentum is attached to the top of the left pulmonary artery.

The ligamentum arteriosum is closely related to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, a branch of the left vagus nerve. After splitting from the left vagus nerve, the left recurrent laryngeal loops around the aortic arch behind the ligamentum arteriosum, after which it ascends to the larynx.

== Function ==
In adults, the ligamentum arteriosum has no useful function. It is a vestige of the ductus arteriosus, a temporary fetal structure that shunts blood from the pulmonary arteries to the aorta. This significantly reduces the volume of blood circulating through the lungs, which are inactive in the womb. The ductus arteriosus becomes the ligamentum arteriosum within three weeks of birth, so that deoxygenated blood can be selectively circulated to the lungs for more efficient oxygenation of the blood.

== Clinical significance ==
The ligamentum arteriosum plays a role in major trauma. It fixes the aorta in place during abrupt motions, consequently potentially resulting in a ruptured aorta. Such ruptures are very rare.

If the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth, a condition known as patent ductus arteriosus can develop. This is a fairly common birth defect. Sufferers may have operations that leave them with no ligamentum arteriosum.

<doc id="572460" wikidata="Q983324" url="?curid=572460" title="Bongbong Marcos">
<text>Ferdinand &quot;Bongbong&quot; Romualdez Marcos Jr. (, , ; born September 13, 1957), commonly referred to by the initials PBBM or BBM, is a Filipino politician who is the 17th and current president of the Philippines. He is the second child and only son of 10th president, kleptocrat and dictator Ferdinand Marcos and former first lady Imelda Marcos.

In 1980, Marcos became Vice Governor of Ilocos Norte, running unopposed with the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party of his father, who was ruling the Philippines under martial law at the time. He then became Governor of Ilocos Norte in 1983, holding that office until his family was ousted from power by the People Power Revolution and fled into exile in Hawaii in February 1986. After the death of his father in 1989, President Corazon Aquino eventually allowed his family to return to the Philippines to face various charges. Marcos and his mother, Imelda, are currently facing arrest in the United States for defying a court order to pay million ( in 2025) in restitution to human rights abuse victims during his father&#x27;s dictatorship. However, as long as he is president of the Philippines, he can enter the United States due to diplomatic immunity.

Marcos was elected as Representative of Ilocos Norte&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1992 to 1995. He was elected Governor of Ilocos Norte again in 1998. After nine years, he returned to his previous position as Representative from 2007 to 2010, then became senator under the Nacionalista Party from 2010 to 2016. Marcos unsuccessfully ran for vice president in the 2016 election, losing to Camarines Sur representative Leni Robredo by a difference of 263,473 votes; in response, Marcos filed an electoral protest at the Presidential Electoral Tribunal but his petition was unanimously dismissed after the pilot recount resulted in Robredo widening her lead by 15,093 additional votes.

Marcos ran for President of the Philippines in the 2022 election under the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas, which he won by a landslide with nearly 59% of the vote. His win was the largest since 1981, when his father won 88% of the votes due to a boycott by the opposition who protested the prior election. 

Marcos&#x27;s presidential campaign received criticism from fact-checkers and disinformation scholars, who found his campaign to be driven by historical negationism aimed at revamping the Marcos brand and smearing his rivals. His campaign has also been accused of whitewashing the human rights abuses and plunder, estimated at 5 to 13 billion dollars, that took place during his father&#x27;s presidency. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has noted how the historical distortionism of the Marcoses has been underway since the 2000s, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited his convictions of tax fraud, including his refusal to pay his family&#x27;s estate taxes, and misrepresentation of his education at the University of Oxford. In 2024, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed him as one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people.

==Early life and education==
Bongbong Marcos was born as Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. on September 13, 1957, at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Santa Mesa, Manila, Philippines, to Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos. At the time of his birth, his father Ferdinand was the representative for the second district of Ilocos Norte, eventually becoming a senator just two years later. His godfathers included prominent personalities and future Marcos cronies Eduardo &quot;Danding&quot; Cojuangco Jr. and pharmaceuticals magnate Jose Yao Campos.

===Education ===
Marcos first studied at the Institución Teresiana in Quezon City and La Salle Green Hills in Mandaluyong, where he obtained his kindergarten and elementary education, respectively.

In 1970, Marcos was sent to England where he lived and studied at Worth School, an all-boys Benedictine institution in West Sussex. He was studying there when his father declared martial law throughout the Philippines in 1972.

Marcos attended the Center for Research and Communication, where he took a special diploma course in economics, but did not finish. He then enrolled at St Edmund Hall, Oxford to study philosophy, politics and economics (PPE). However, despite his false claims that he graduated with a bachelor of arts in PPE, he did not obtain such a degree. Marcos had passed philosophy, but failed economics, and failed politics twice, thus making him ineligible for a degree. Instead, he received a special diploma in social studies, which was awarded mainly to non-graduates and is currently no longer offered by the university. Marcos still falsely claims that he obtained a degree from the University of Oxford despite Oxford confirming in 2015 that Marcos did not finish his degree.

Marcos enrolled in the Masters in Business Administration program at the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, United States, which he failed to complete. Marcos asserts that he withdrew from the program for his election as Vice Governor of Ilocos Norte in 1980. The Presidential Commission on Good Government later reported that his tuition, his ( in 2025) monthly allowance, and the estate he lived in while studying at Wharton, were paid using funds that could be traced partly to the intelligence funds of the Office of the President, and partly to some of the fifteen bank accounts that the Marcoses had secretly opened in the US under assumed names.

===Early public roles===

Marcos was thrust into the national limelight as early as when he was three years old, and the scrutiny became even more intense when his father first ran for President of the Philippines in 1965, when he was eight years old.

During his father&#x27;s 1965 campaign, Marcos played himself in the Sampaguita Pictures film &quot;Iginuhit ng Tadhana (The Ferdinand E. Marcos Story)&quot;, a biopic based on the novel &quot;For Every Tear a Victory&quot;. The young Marcos was portrayed giving a speech towards the end of the film, in which he says that he would like to be a politician when he grows up. The public relations value of the film is credited for having helped the elder Marcos win the 1965 Philippine elections.

A young Bongbong Marcos and his sister Imee played a small role in the controversial &quot;Manila incident&quot; of the Beatles in July 1966, just six months after their father assumed the presidency. Bongbong and Imee were among 400 children whom their mother Imelda brought to Malacañang Palace for a reception in which they expected the Beatles to show up. The four band members claimed not to know about the event, and refused to attend. As the event went on without them, the Marcos children were interviewed. Bongbong, referring to the group&#x27;s long hair, was quoted saying &quot;I&#x27;d like to pounce on the Beatles and cut off their hair! Don&#x27;t anybody dare me to do anything, because I&#x27;ll do it, just to see how game the Beatles are.&quot; Imee, meantime, was quoted saying &quot;There is only one song I like from the Beatles, and it&#x27;s Run for Your Life.&quot;—a quote which media later associated with the way the Beatles scrambled out of Manila, receiving rough treatment at the Manila International Airport.

Beatles lead guitarist George Harrison later accused the Marcoses of inciting Filipinos to mob the band as they tried to leave the country for not showing up at the reception, saying in a 1986 interview at NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; that the Marcoses &quot;tried to kill [them].&quot; Harrison further said that their plane was not allowed to leave Manila until their manager, Brian Epstein, refunded the concert ticket money.

The &quot;Manila Bulletin&quot; reported in 2015 that Marcos had once invited Beatles drummer Ringo Starr to return to the Philippines &quot;to bring closure&quot; to the incident. The incident was brought up in the media again after a 2021 interview between Marcos and actress Toni Gonzaga, when he was asked about which musicians he idolized, and he casually mentioned that he was friends with Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones and members of the Beatles.

Marcos was still a minor on the exact year that martial law was declared. Marcos turned 18 in 1975—a year after he graduated from Worth School.

==Roles in the Marcos regime==
===Vice governorship and governorship in Ilocos Norte===
Marcos&#x27;s first formal role in a political office came with his election as Vice Governor of Ilocos Norte (1980–1983) at the age of 22. On March 23, 1983, he was installed as the Governor of Ilocos Norte, replacing his aunt Elizabeth Marcos-Keon, who had resigned from the post for health reasons. In 1983, he led a group of young Filipino leaders on a 10-day diplomatic mission to China to mark the tenth anniversary of Philippine–Chinese relations. He stayed in office until the People Power Revolution in 1986.

During Marcos&#x27;s term, at least two extrajudicial killings took place in Ilocos Norte, as documented by the Martial Law Victims Association of Ilocos Norte (MLVAIN).

===Chairmanship of PHILCOMSAT Board===
Marcos was appointed by his father to be chairman of the board of the Philippine Communications Satellite Corporation (PHILCOMSAT) in early 1985. In a prominent example of what Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin later branded &quot;crony capitalism&quot;, the Marcos administration had sold its majority shares to Marcos cronies such as Roberto S. Benedicto, Manuel H. Nieto, Jose Yao Campos, and Rolando Gapud in 1982, despite being very profitable because of its role as the sole agent for the Philippines&#x27; link to global satellite network Intelsat. President Marcos acquired a 39.9% share in the company through front companies under Campos and Gapud. This allowed President Marcos to appoint his son as the chairman of the Philcomsat board in early 1985, allowing the young Marcos to draw a monthly salary &quot;ranging from to &quot; ( to in 2025) despite rarely visiting the office and having no duties there. PHILCOMSAT was one of five telecommunications firms sequestered by the Philippine government in 1986.

===Ill-gotten Marcos family wealth===

After the Marcos family went into exile in 1986, the Presidential Commission on Good Government found that the three Marcos children benefited significantly from what the Supreme Court of the Philippines defined as &quot;ill-gotten wealth&quot; of the Marcos family.

Aside from the tuition, US$10,000 ( in 2025) monthly allowance, and the estates used by Marcos Jr. and Imee Marcos during their respective studies at Wharton and Princeton, each of the Marcos children was assigned a mansion in the Metro Manila area, as well as in Baguio, the Philippines&#x27; designated summer capital. Properties specifically said to have been given to Marcos Jr. included the Wigwam House compound on Outlook Drive in Baguio and the Seaside Mansion Compound in Parañaque.

In addition, by the time their father was ousted from power in 1986, both Marcos Jr. and Imee held key posts in the Marcos administration. Imee was already 30 when she was appointed as the national head of the Kabataang Barangay in the late 1970s, and Marcos Jr. was in his 20s when he took up the vice-gubernatorial post for the province of Ilocos Norte in 1980, and then became governor of that province from 1983 until the Marcos family was ousted from Malacañang in 1986.

==EDSA revolution and exile (1986–1991)==
During the last days of the 1986 People Power Revolution, Bongbong Marcos, in combat fatigues to project his warlike stance, pushed his father Ferdinand Marcos to give the order to his remaining troops to attack and blow up Camp Crame despite the presence of hundreds of thousands of civilians there. The elder Marcos did not follow his son&#x27;s urgings.

Fearful of a scenario in which Marcos&#x27;s presence in the Philippines would lead to a civil war, the Reagan administration withdrew its support for the Marcos government, and flew Marcos and a party of about 80 individuals – the extended Marcos family and a number of close associates – from the Philippines to Hawaii despite Ferdinand Marcos&#x27;s objections. Bongbong Marcos and his family were on the flight with his parents.

Soon after arriving in Hawaii, the younger Marcos participated in an attempt to withdraw million ( in 2025) from a secret family bank account with Credit Suisse in Switzerland, an act which eventually led to the Swiss government freezing the Marcoses&#x27; bank accounts in late March that year.

The Marcoses initially stayed at Hickam Air Force Base at the expense of the U.S. government. A month after arriving in Honolulu, they moved into a pair of residences in Makiki Heights, Honolulu, which were registered to Marcos cronies Antonio Floirendo and Bienvenido and Gliceria Tantoco.

Ferdinand Marcos eventually died in exile three years later, in 1989, with Marcos Jr. being the only family member present at his father&#x27;s deathbed.

==Return to the Philippines and later activities (1991–present)==
In the early 1990s, President Corazon Aquino permitted the return of the remaining members of the Marcos family to the Philippines to face various charges. Bongbong Marcos flew on a private plane from Singapore to the Philippines and landed in Laoag, Ilocos Norte on October 31, 1991, becoming the first Marcos family member to return to the Philippines since 1986; his mother Imelda followed suit four days later. He soon sought political office, beginning in the family&#x27;s traditional fiefdom in Ilocos Norte.

===House of Representatives, first term===

Marcos ran for and was elected representative of the second district of Ilocos Norte to the Philippine House of Representatives (1992–1995). When his mother, Imelda Marcos, ran for president in the same election, he decided against supporting her candidacy, and instead expressed support for his godfather Danding Cojuangco. During his term, Marcos was the author of 29 House bills and co-author of 90 more, which includes those that paved the way for the creation of the Department of Energy and the National Youth Commission. He also allocated most of his Countryside Development Fund (CDF) to organizing the cooperatives of teachers and farmers in his home province. In October 1992, he led a group of ten representatives in attending the first sports summit in the Philippines, held in Baguio. In late 1994, he was made president of the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party, which is known for its support for the Marcos regime.

In 1995, Marcos ran for the Senate under the NPC-led coalition but lost, placing only 16th.

====Compromise deal attempt====
In 1995, Bongbong Marcos pushed a deal to allow the Marcos family to keep a quarter of the estimated US$2 billion to US$10 billion ( to in 2025) that the Philippine government had still not recovered from them, on the condition that all civil cases be dropped – a deal that was eventually struck down by the Philippines&#x27; Supreme Court.

===Ilocos Norte governor, second stint===
Having previously served as Ilocos Norte governor from 1983 to 1986, Marcos was again elected as governor of Ilocos Norte in 1998, running against his father&#x27;s closest friend and ally, Roque Ablan Jr. He served for three consecutive terms ending in 2007.

===House of Representatives, second term===
In 2007, Marcos ran unopposed for the congressional seat previously held by his older sister Imee. He was then appointed as deputy minority leader of the House of Representatives. During this term, Marcos supported the passage of the Philippine Archipelagic Baselines Law, or Republic Act No. 9522. He also wrote his own version of the law, but the bill only remained in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. He also promoted the Republic Act No. 9502 (Universally Accessible Cheaper and Quality Medicines Act) which was enacted on 2009.

===Senate career===
 Marcos made a second attempt for the Senate in 2010. On November 20, 2009, the KBL forged an alliance with the Nacionalista Party (NP) between Marcos and NP chair Senator Manny Villar at the Laurel House in Mandaluyong. Marcos became a guest senatorial candidate of the NP through this alliance. Marcos was later removed as a member by the KBL National Executive Committee on November 23, 2009. As such, the NP broke its alliance with the KBL due to internal conflicts within the party, however Marcos remained part of the NP senatorial lineup. He was proclaimed as one of the winning senatorial candidates of the 2010 senate elections. He took office on June 30, 2010.

In the 15th Congress (2010–2013), Marcos authored 34 Senate bills. He also co-authored 17 bills of which seven were enacted into law – most notably the Anti-Drunk and Drugged Driving Act whose principal author was Senator Vicente Sotto III; the Cybercrime Prevention Act whose principal author was Senator Edgardo Angara; and the Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons and the National Health Insurance Acts, both of which were principally authored by Senator Loren Legarda.

In the 16th Congress (2013–2016), Marcos filed 52 bills, of which 28 were refiled from the 15th Congress. One of them was enacted into law: Senate Bill No. 1186, which sought the postponement of the 2013 Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) elections, was enacted as Republic Act No. 10632 on October 3, 2013.

Marcos also co-authored 4 Senate bills in the 16th Congress. One of them, Senate Bill No. 712 which was principally authored by Ralph Recto, was enacted as Republic Act No. 10645, the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010.

He was the chair of the Senate committees on urban planning, housing and resettlement, local government, and public works. He also chaired the oversight committee on the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Organic Act, the congressional oversight panel on the Special Purpose Vehicle Act, and a select oversight committee on barangay affairs.

====2014 pork barrel scam====
In 2014, Bongbong Marcos was implicated by Janet Lim Napoles and Benhur Luy in the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) Pork Barrel scam through agent Catherine Mae &quot;Maya&quot; Santos. He allegedly channeled million through 4 fake NGOs linked with Napoles. Marcos claimed that the large amounts of money was released by the budget department without his knowledge and that his signatures were forged. In connection to the PDAF scam, Marcos was also sued for plunder by (), an alliance of youth organizations. The group cited Luy&#x27;s digital files, which showed bogus NGOs with shady or non-existent offices.

====2016 Commission on Audit suit====
In 2016, Marcos was also sued for &quot;plunder&quot; for funneling million of his PDAF via 9 special allotment release orders (SARO) to the following bogus foundations from October 2011 to January 2013, according to Luy&#x27;s digital files:

* Social Development Program for Farmers Foundation (SDPFFI) – million
* Countrywide Agri and Rural Economic Development Foundation (CARED) – million
* People&#x27;s Organization for Progress and Development Foundation (POPDFI) – million
* Health Education Assistance Resettlement Training Services (HEARTS) – million
* Kaupdanan Para Sa Mangunguma Foundation (KMFI) – million
* National Livelihood Development Corporation (NLDC) – million

These NGOs were found by the Commission on Audit (COA) as bogus with shady or non-existent offices.

===2016 vice presidential campaign===
On October 5, 2015, Marcos announced via his website that he would run for Vice President of the Philippines in the 2016 general election, stating &quot;I have decided to run for vice president in the May 2016 elections.&quot; Marcos ran as an independent candidate. Prior to his announcement, he had declined an invitation by presidential candidate, Vice President Jejomar Binay, to become his running mate. On October 15, 2015, presidential candidate Miriam Defensor Santiago confirmed that Marcos would serve as her running mate.

Marcos placed second in the tightly contested vice presidential race losing to Camarines Sur 3rd district Representative Leni Robredo, who won by a margin of 263,473 votes, one of the closest since Fernando Lopez&#x27;s victory in the 1965 vice presidential election.

====Election results protest====

Marcos challenged the results of the election, lodging an electoral protest against Leni Robredo on June 29, 2016, the day before Robredo&#x27;s oathtaking. President Rodrigo Duterte has stated several times that he would resign if Marcos would be his successor instead of Vice President Leni Robredo.

A recount began in April 2018, covering polling precincts in Iloilo and Camarines Sur, which were areas handpicked by Marcos&#x27;s camp. In October 2019, the tribunal found that Robredo&#x27;s lead grew by around 15,000 votes – a total of 278,566 votes from Robredo&#x27;s original lead of 263,473 votes – after a recount of ballots from the 5,415 clustered precincts in Marcos&#x27;s identified pilot provinces. On February 16, 2021, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) unanimously dismissed Bongbong Marcos&#x27;s electoral protest against Leni Robredo.

===2022 presidential campaign and election===


Marcos officially launched his campaign for president of the Philippines on October 5, 2021, through a video post on Facebook and YouTube. An interview with his wife Liza Marcos revealed that he decided to run for president while watching the film &quot;Ant-Man&quot;, though Marcos admitted that he could not recall this moment. He ran under the banner of the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas party, assuming chairmanship of the party on the same day, while also being endorsed by his former party, the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan. Marcos filed his certificate of candidacy before the Commission on Elections the following day. On November 16, Marcos announced his running mate to be Davao City mayor Sara Duterte, daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte. Under the campaign theme of unity, Marcos and Duterte&#x27;s alliance was given the name &quot;UniTeam&quot;.

Seven petitions were filed against Marcos&#x27;s presidential bid. Three petitions aimed to cancel his certificate of candidacy (COC), one petition aimed to declare Marcos a nuisance candidate, and three petitions aimed to disqualify him. Most of the petitions were based on Marcos&#x27;s 1995 conviction for failing to file tax returns. Three disqualification petitions were consolidated and raffled to the commission&#x27;s first division, while three other petitions were handed to the second division. The final petition was also handed to the first division. Marcos dismissed the petitions as nuisance petitions with no legal basis and propaganda against him. On May 16 and 18, 2022, respectively, two of the petitions were filed at the Supreme Court. The consolidated petitions were dismissed by the Court on June 28. 

Marcos regularly maintained a wide lead in presidential surveys throughout the months leading up to the May 2022 election; he was the first presidential candidate in the country to attain poll ratings of over 50% from surveys conducted by Pulse Asia since it began polling in 1999. His refrainment from attending all but one of the presidential debates during the campaign season was widely criticized.

In a joint session of the 18th Congress of the Philippines, overseen by Senate President Tito Sotto and House Speaker Lord Allan Velasco and stated by Senate Majority Leader Migz Zubiri and Majority Floor Leader Martin Romualdez, Marcos was proclaimed the president-elect of the Philippines on May 25, 2022, alongside his running-mate, Vice-President-elect Sara Duterte. Marcos received 31,629,783 votes, or 58.77% of the total votes cast, about 16.5 million votes ahead of his closest rival, Vice President Leni Robredo, who received over 15 million votes. He became the first presidential candidate to be elected by a majority since the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1986. According to analysts, Marcos, together with Sara Duterte, &quot;inherited&quot; Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s popularity when they both won landslides in the election. Historians noted the significance of his victory as a &quot;full circle&quot; of the Philippines from the People Power Revolution, which deposed his father from the presidency, thus marking the Marcos family&#x27;s return to national power after 36 years. His majority was the largest since 1981 (surpassing his father&#x27;s 18,309,360 votes); as the opposition boycotted that election, it is the largest majority since 1969 for a competitive election, and his 31-percentage point margin over his nearest opponent was the greatest since Ramon Magsaysay scored a 38-point margin over incumbent President Elpidio Quirino in 1953. His vote count was not only the largest ever recorded in a presidential election, but close to the sum total of the two previous records combined.

On June 20, 2022, Marcos announced that he will serve as the Secretary of Agriculture in concurrent capacity.

==Presidency (2022–present)==



===Early actions===
On June 30, 2022, at 12:00 noon PST, Marcos Jr. took the oath of office as the 17th President of the Philippines at the National Museum of the Philippines and was administered the oath by Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo. At concurrent capacity, Marcos appointed himself as Secretary of Agriculture, in order to address inflation and personally monitor the food and agricultural sectors, while enacting efforts to boost farm outputs through various loan programs, affordable pricing measures, and machinery assistance. Marcos&#x27;s first executive order as president were abolishing two offices: the Presidential Anti Corruption Commission and the Office of the Cabinet Secretary. 

The next day after his inauguration, Marcos signed a memorandum seeking to provide free train rides to students, and extends the free rides of the EDSA Carousel until the end of December 2022. Twelve days later, on July 13, 2022, Marcos announced that the free train rides will only be limited to students using the LRT Line 2, due to the line&#x27;s access points to the University Belt. 

Two days after his inauguration, on July 2, 2022, Marcos vetoed a bill sponsored by his sister Senator Imee Marcos that aimed to create a free economic zone within New Manila International Airport. Bongbong Marcos said that the bill would cite &quot;substantial fiscal risks&quot;, lacked coherences with existing laws, and the proposed economic zone&#x27;s location near the existing Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone; Marcos also called for further studies in establishing the planned economic zone. On the same day, Marcos also ordered that the list of Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program beneficiaries to be cleansed after receiving reports of unqualified beneficiaries receiving cash assistance grants and downturned calls to surrender their accounts.

On July 5, 2022, five days after his inauguration, Marcos held his first cabinet meeting, which was delayed during his inauguration, and laid out his first agenda, which primarily focuses on reviving the economy in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the meeting, Marcos led the discussions with his economic managers, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno, National Economic and Development Authority Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Felipe Medalla, to give a briefing about the country&#x27;s economic status, and to lay out plans to further revive the country&#x27;s economy, while combating inflation. Marcos also tackled issues regarding food security, transportation issues, and the reopening of face-to-face classes within the year. On July 23, 2022, Marcos has vetoed a bill which seeks to strengthen the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC), as he cited that several provisions of the bill are &quot;inequitable&quot;.

On July 25, 2022, the same day of his first State of the Nation Address, Marcos allowed Republic Act No. 11900, known as the Vaporized Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Products Regulation Act to lapse into law. The law became controversial, due to the hounding health risks regarding the usage of electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products. In an effort to boost the country&#x27;s booster shot campaign, Marcos launched the &quot;PinasLakas&quot; campaign to continue administering COVID-19 booster doses within the public, by targeting a total of at least 39 million Filipinos to get their booster shots.

Two days after his first State of the Nation Address, following a meeting with Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, Presidential Legal Adviser Juan Ponce Enrile, Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, and former presidential spokesman and lawyer Harry Roque on July 27, 2022, Marcos expressed that the Philippines has no intention of rejoining the International Criminal Court, as the death cases linked to the country&#x27;s drug war of his predecessor&#x27;s administration are already being investigated by the government, and stated that the government is taking the necessary steps regarding the deaths. On July 30, 2022, Marcos vetoed a bill which grants tax exemption on poll workers&#x27; honoraria and the creation of a transport safety board, stating that the honoraria &quot;counters the objective of the government&#x27;s Comprehensive Tax Reform Program&quot;, while mentioning that the proposed creation of a transport safety board &quot;undertakes the functions by the different agencies&quot; within the transport sector.

===Domestic policy===
====Agriculture and agrarian reforms====
Subsequently serving as the Secretary of Agriculture, Marcos launched initiatives which aims to improve domestic agricultural output and production, while expanding measures to further establish a farm-to-market approach in providing agricultural products to local markets and far flung areas. In August 2022, as high sugar prices impacted the country due to the effects of Typhoon Odette in December 2021, the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) in August 2022 released an order to import of sugar, which is aimed to reduce costs and increase the sugar stockpiles. A few days later, Marcos rejected the proposed importation, and Malacañang deemed the move as illegal, as the move was made without Marcos&#x27;s approval, nor signed by him. SRA Undersecretary Leocadio Sebastian later apologized for the move and later resigned his post on Marcos; behalf, prompting SRA Administrator Hermenegildo Serafica and SRA board member Roland Beltran to follow suit a few days later. The move also caused Malacañang to instigate reforms within the SRA organization, and launched a campaign into alleged efforts of using the sugar order as a &quot;cover measure&quot; for hoarding by sugar traders. 

In November 2022, Marcos expanded the Kadiwa Project launched by the Duterte administration, which aims to offer fresh local produces to local markets and other key areas in lower prices, and creates a direct farm-to-market approach of goods and services. The programs is located in various areas throughout the country and temporarily occupies various facilities owned by local governments. The move is also aimed to be expanded permanently to accommodate more consumers affected by inflation. 

In January 2023, amid rising prices of onions in the country, Marcos approved the importation of of onions to cater the gap caused by low local outputs, and stated that the government was &quot;left without a choice&quot; despite approving the smuggled onions to be supplied in local markets.

Marcos signed his fourth executive order on September 14, 2022, which establishes a one-year moratorium on the amortization and interest payments of agrarian reform beneficiaries. The move is seen to assist farmers from debt payments and allows a flexible approach in financial assistance.

In July 2023, Marcos signed the New Agrarian Emancipation Act, freeing at least 600,000 agrarian reform beneficiaries of decades-old debts worth 57-billion under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.

After serving as Secretary of Agriculture for over a year that was marked by a rise in food prices, Marcos relinquished his position and appointed Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr., president of a deep-sea fishing company and a donor to Marcos&#x27; 2022 presidential election campaign.

====Defense====
In August 2022, the Marcos administration said it was considering ordering helicopters from the United States military, such as the Boeing CH-47 Chinook, to replace the 16 Russian Mil Mi-17 military helicopters purchased by the Duterte administration, but cancelled the program a few days before the end of Duterte&#x27;s term out of concerns about existing United States sanctions such as the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) and possible future sanctions in response to the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Negotiations are also ongoing to procure limited units which was paid by the government to Rosoboronexport.

Marcos expressed support for the AFP Modernization Program, which aims to boost the country&#x27;s defense capabilities. Stating that the country&#x27;s external security situation is becoming &quot;more complex and unpredictable&quot;, Marcos ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to shift its focus on its defense operations against external threats, due to the lower risks in the country&#x27;s insurgencies, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan. 

During the 125th-anniversary celebration of the Philippine Navy, Marcos announced plans to acquire the Philippines&#x27; first submarine. The French-based Naval Group, along with other contenders, has offered its Scorpène-class submarines to strengthen the Navy.

With an aim to enhance the country&#x27;s defense capabilities, Marcos has approved the &quot;Re-Horizon 3&quot; of the AFP Modernization Program, which is also known as the RAFMP. The $35 billion plan revised modernization program will be spread out over 10 years and aims to modernize the Armed Forces of the Philippines based on the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept (CADC), a defense concept aimed at strengthening the country&#x27;s external defense deterrence by projecting power within the Philippine&#x27;s 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone, Benham Rise, the Luzon Strait, and the Sulu Sea through inter-island defenses doctrines, multi-layered domain strategies, and long-range strike capabilities. The concept also aims to strengthen the country&#x27;s aerial and maritime domain awareness, connectivity, and intelligence capabilities.

====Education====
In August 2022, despite the low COVID-19 vaccination rate among Filipino students with a total vaccination rate of only 19%, Marcos, along with Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte, reopened onsite classes throughout the country, with 46% or 24,000 schools throughout the country reopening their classes on August 22. Meanwhile, 29,721 schools were allowed to continue implementing blended learning from August to October 2022, while the full implementation of onsite classes began within November 2022, with 97.5% of public schools returning to onsite classes, while the remaining 2.36% of classes were temporarily held online due to the effects of Severe Tropical Storm Paeng.

Marcos also reviewed the implementation of the K–12 program as part of his push to modernize the country&#x27;s education system, and laid out measures such as system reforms to address the lack of jobs and potential job mismatches, reviewing the usage of English as a medium of instruction in schools, and improving the country&#x27;s education technology systems. Marcos also expressed his support to modernize the country&#x27;s schools by improving science-related subjects and courses, theoretical aptitude, and vocational skills.

====Economy====
In the early years of his presidency, he sought to prioritize the country&#x27;s post-COVID-19 pandemic economy as highlighted by his economic agenda. He lift the lockdowns and facemask restrictions. His administration sought to target a 6.5 to 7.5% real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, with a 6.5 to 8% annual real GDP growth rate, a 9% or single-digit poverty rate by 2028, a 3% national government deficit-to-GDP ratio by 2028, lowering the country&#x27;s debt-to-GDP ratio to less than 60% by 2025, and securing an upper middle-income status by 2024 with a US$4,256 income per capita, which is part of his 2023–2028 fiscal strategy. Marcos also supports the creation of additional economic zones in various areas of the country to attract investments and laid out plans to impose digital taxes and improve the country&#x27;s tax compliance procedures which should improve revenue collections and cut the country&#x27;s debts, while maintaining the country&#x27;s disbursements at above 20 percent of its GDP.

====Insurgency====
====Telecommunications====
===Foreign policy===


Early in his presidency, Marcos promised to continue his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s foreign policy of being &quot;friends to all, enemies to none&quot;. Marcos initially sought closer ties with China, but has since been increasingly seen as more pro-American than Duterte in an attempt to create a centrist-style balancing act between the two superpowers. During his first State of the Nation Address, Marcos promised to &quot;not preside over any process that will abandon even one-square inch of territory of the Republic of the Philippines to any foreign power&quot;.

Under his presidency, Marcos intensified the Philippines&#x27; cooperation on both economic and defense arrangements to Western countries, such as the United States, Japan, Australia, and the European Union, while strengthening its defense posture within the region. Marcos approved the designation of four additional bases to be used by the United States military under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. In May 2024, the Philippines and the United States held its largest Balikatan military exercises, fueling concerns from local civilians who fear they would be affected in any future war between the US and China. The deployment of the United States&#x27; Typhon Weapons System in an undisclosed location in northern Luzon also caught the attention of Russian president Vladimir Putin, who said that Russia should resume producing nuclear-capable missiles and consider where to deploy them.

Marcos called on all involved parties on the South China Sea to abide by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in order to diffuse potential conflicts in the future. Due to Marcos&#x27; &quot;transparency thrust&quot; in dealing with the aggressive actions of the Chinese Coast Guard and the Chinese Maritime Militia, China–Philippines relations have significantly deteriorated during Marcos&#x27;s tenure, with increasing tensions over territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the Philippines withdrawing from the Belt and Road initiative.

==Court cases==
===Income and estate tax case convictions===

On June 27, 1990, a special tax audit team of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) investigated the tax liabilities and obligations of the late Ferdinand Marcos Sr., who died on September 29, 1989. The investigation disclosed in a 1991 memorandum that the Marcos family had failed to file estate tax returns and several income tax returns covering the years of 1982 to 1986 in violation of the National Internal Revenue Code.

The BIR also issued a deficiency estate tax assessment against the estate of the late Ferdinand Marcos Sr. in 1991 for unpaid estate taxes from 1982 to 1985, and 1985 to 1986, totaling ( in 2022). Formal assessment notices were served to Bongbong Marcos at his office at the Batasang Pambansa Complex on October 20, 1992, who was then the representative of the 2nd District of Ilocos Norte. Several notices of levy were also issued by the BIR February 22, 1993, to May 26, 1993, to satisfy the deficiency of estate tax returns, to no avail.

On March 12, 1993, lawyer Loreto Ata, representing Bongbong Marcos, called the attention of the BIR to notify them of any action taken by the BIR against his client. Bongbong Marcos then filed an instant petition on June 25, 1993, for &quot;certiorari&quot; and prohibition to contest the estate tax deficiency assessment.

On July 27, 1995, Quezon City Regional Trial Court Judge Benedicto Ulep convicted Marcos to seven years in jail and a fine of US$2,812 ( in 2025) plus back taxes for tax evasion in his failure to file an income tax return from the period of 1982 to 1985 while sitting as the vice governor of Ilocos Norte (1980–1983) and as governor of Ilocos Norte (1983–1986). Marcos subsequently appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals over his conviction. However, in 1994, the Court of Appeals ruled that the estate tax deficiency assessment had become &quot;final and unappealable&quot;, allowing it to be enforced.

On October 31, 1997, the Court of Appeals affirmed its earlier decision with Marcos being convicted for the failure of the filing of an income tax return under Section 45 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977 while being acquitted of tax evasion under the charge of violating Section 50 of the same statute. In spite of the removal of the penalty of imprisonment, Marcos was ordered the payment of back income taxes to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) with interest and the issuance of corresponding fines of per count of non-filing of income tax returns from 1982 to 1984 and for 1985, plus the accrued interest. Marcos later filed a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the Philippines over the modified conviction imposed by the Court of Appeals but subsequently withdrew his petition on August 8, 2001, thereby declaring the ruling as final and executory.

In 2021, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court certified that there were no records on file of Marcos settling the corresponding tax dues and fines. However, according to Marcos&#x27;s campaign team, documents issued by the Supreme Court, the BIR, and a receipt issued by the Land Bank of the Philippines state that the tax dues were paid, while elections commissioner Rowena Guanzon noted that the documents Marcos submitted to the Commission on Elections were not receipts of taxes paid to the BIR but rather receipts from the Land Bank for lease rentals. Nevertheless, the Commission on Elections ruled against the consolidated disqualification cases against Marcos and stated that &quot;Further, to prove the absence of any ill-intention and bad faith on his part,&quot; Marcos submitted a Bureau of Internal Revenue certification and an official receipt from the Landbank, showing his compliance with the CA decision directing him to pay deficiency income taxes amounting to a little over , including fines and surcharges.

The estate tax deficiency assessment issued by the BIR has remained uncollected since the Supreme Court ruling on October 12, 1991. Since the ruling of the Supreme Court in 1997 which had junked the petition of Marcos to contest the estate tax deficiency assessment, under the Ramos, Arroyo, Aquino, and Duterte administrations, the BIR has issued renewed written demands on the Marcos family to pay the estate tax liabilities, which has remained unpaid. As a result, the estate tax deficiency assessment, with penalties, is estimated to have ballooned to ( billion) as of 2021.

The unpaid estate tax return was used as grounds in one petition to cancel Marcos&#x27;s certificate of candidacy for president in the 2022 elections. On March 1, 2022, presidential candidate and Manila mayor Isko Moreno said that he would implement the Supreme Court ruling ordering the Marcos family to pay their estate tax debts if elected, vowing to use the proceeds as relief aid (&quot;ayuda&quot;) for victims of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ernest Ramel, the secretary general of Aksyon Demokratiko, the party of Moreno continuously called out BIR about the issue.

On March 28, 2022, Senator Aquilino Pimentel III filed Senate Resolution No. 998, stating an urgent and pressing need for the Senate to look into why the estate tax has remained uncollected for almost 25 years, which the amount has already been ruled to be due and demandable against the heirs of his father.

===2007 Payanig sa Pasig property case motion===

On June 19, 2007, Marcos Jr. filed a motion to intervene in, OCLP v. PCGG, Civil Case Number 0093 at the Sandiganbayan, the Philippines&#x27; anti-graft court. The case had been filed by Ortigas &amp; Company, Ltd. Partnership (OCLP) against the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) over the former Payanig sa Pasig property bordering Ortigas Avenue, Julia Vargas Avenue, and Meralco Avenue in Ortigas Center, Pasig, which had been the site of the &#x27;Payanig sa Pasig&#x27; theme park, but is now the location of various businesses, most notably the Metrowalk shopping and recreation complex.

The PCGG considers the property the &quot;crown jewel&quot; among the properties sequestered from the Marcoses&#x27; ill-gotten wealth, estimating its minimum value to be about billion in March 2015. The property had been surrendered to the PCGG in 1986, as part of the settlement deal of Marcos crony Jose Yao Campos, who was holding the property under various companies on Marcos Sr.&#x27;s behalf. Ortigas &amp; Company countered that Marcos Sr. had coerced them to sell the property to him in 1968. Marcos Jr.&#x27;s motion claimed that his father had bought the property legally, but the Sandiganbayan dismissed his motion on October 18, 2008, saying it had already dismissed a similar motion filed years earlier by his mother Imelda.

===2011 Hawaii contempt judgement===
In 2011, the Hawaii District Court ruled Bongbong Marcos and his mother Imelda Marcos to be in contempt, fining them million ( in 2025) fine for not respecting an injunction from a 1992 judgement in a human rights victims case, which commanded them not to dissipate the assets of Ferdinand Marcos&#x27;s estate. The ruling was upheld by the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on October 24, 2012, and is believed to be &quot;the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.&quot; While the 1992 case was against Ferdinand Marcos, the 2011 judgment was against Imelda and Bongbong personally. The judgement also effectively barred Imelda and Bongbong from entering any US territory. However, on June 9, 2022, United States Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman clarified in a roundtable discussion with local reporters during a state visit, that as a head of state, Marcos enjoys diplomatic immunity in all circumstances, stating that he is welcome to visit the United States under his official role.

==Political views==
Marcos has described his political views as &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;Machiavellian&quot;. He has also described the &quot;spirit of nationalism&quot; as a force driving progress in the Philippines. Before taking office, Marcos has been described in media reports as a populist. On social issues, he is in favor of legalizing abortion for rape and incest victims as well as divorce and same-sex unions. Marcos is also opposed to reinstating the death penalty for convicted heinous criminals and lowering the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 12. In terms of economic policy, analysts have speculated that Marcos would pursue liberal policies as opposed to protectionist rhetoric during his presidential campaign. 

===Marcos-Duterte feud===

Amid the feud of the Marcos and Duterte clans in late April 2023, House Speaker and Marcos&#x27; cousin Martin Romualdez said the House of Representatives will probe into an agreement former president Rodrigo Duterte made during his presidency with Chinese president Xi Jinping. Under the agreement, Duterte agreed to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; in the South China Sea to avoid escalating a war. Political analyst Ronald Llamas said the probe was engineered by Marcos as a &quot;political payback&quot; to Duterte&#x27;s verbal attacks and to reduce Duterte&#x27;s political influence ahead of the 2025 midterm elections.

In 2024, Duterte criticized the Marcos administration&#x27;s curtailment of the freedom of speech in violation of the 1987 Bill of Rights. Duterte&#x27;s nationwide &quot;&quot;Hakbang ng Maisug&quot; (brave) prayer-rallies, which Duterte said the Marcos administration deliberately aimed to thwart, suffered setbacks and cancellations. Duterte, however, said he prayed for Marcos to survive until the end of his term since Duterte does not want himself or his daughter Sara to become president.
&lt;br&gt;
In November 2024, Philippine authorities subpoenaed vice president Duterte after she threatened to have Marcos, his wife, and the House Speaker assassinated if she were killed. Marcos condemned her remarks as a criminal threat and increased his security, while Eduardo Año called the threats a national security concern. Duterte clarified that her comments were not threats but a concern for her safety, dismissing the government&#x27;s actions as politically motivated. She was ordered to appear before the National Bureau of Investigation, with such statements potentially leading to criminal charges. Despite growing calls for Duterte&#x27;s impeachment, Marcos has publicly voiced his opinion against impeaching her, calling it &quot;a storm in a teacup&quot; and considering the move inconsequential to the lives of Filipinos.

==Public profile==
===Historical distortionism===

As with other Marcos family members who have stayed in the public eye since their return to the Philippines, Marcos has received significant criticism for instances of historical denialism, and his trivialization of the human rights violations and economic plunder that took place during the Marcos administration, and of the role he played in the administration. Specific criticisms have been leveled at Marcos for being unapologetic for human rights violations and ill-gotten wealth during his father&#x27;s administration. Of the human rights victims, Marcos Jr. said of them in 1999: &quot;They don&#x27;t want an apology, they want money.&quot; He then proceeded to state that his family would apologize only if they had done something wrong.

When victims of human rights abuses during his father&#x27;s administration commemorated the 40th year of the proclamation of martial law in 2012, Marcos Jr. dismissed their calls for an apology for the atrocities as &quot;self-serving statements by politicians, self-aggrandizement narratives, pompous declarations, and political posturing and propaganda&quot;.&quot;&quot; In the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; later that year, Bongbong cited the various court decisions against the Marcos family as a reason not to apologize for Martial Law abuses, saying &quot;we have a judgment against us in the billions. What more would people want?&quot;

During his 2016 vice presidential campaign, Marcos responded to then-president Benigno Aquino III&#x27;s criticism of the Marcos regime and call to oppose his election run. He dismissed the events, saying Filipinos should &quot;leave history to the professors.&quot; This prompted over 500 faculty, staff and history professors from the Ateneo de Manila University to immediately issue a statement condemning his dismissive retort as part of &quot;an ongoing willful distortion of our history,&quot; and a &quot;shameless refusal to acknowledge the crimes of the Martial Law regime.&quot; More than 1,400 Catholic schools, through the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP), later joined the call of the Ateneo faculty &quot;against the attempt of [Marcos] to canonize the harrowing horrors of martial rule.&quot; This was also followed by the University of the Philippines Diliman&#x27;s Department of History, which released a statement of its own, decrying what they called a &quot;dangerous&quot; effort for Marcos to create &quot;myth and deception.&quot;

On September 20, 2018, Marcos Jr. released a YouTube video showing a between him and former senate president Juan Ponce Enrile, who had been his father&#x27;s defense minister before playing a key role in his ouster during the 1986 EDSA revolution. The video made a number of claims, which were quickly refuted and denounced by martial law victims, including former senate president Aquilino Pimentel Jr., former DSWD secretary Judy Taguiwalo, former Commission on Human Rights chair Etta Rosales, and writer Boni Ilagan, among others. Enrile later backpedaled from some of his claims, attributing them to &quot;unlucid intervals.&quot;

===Online presence===
According to research by Vera Files, Marcos benefited the most from fake news from the Philippines in 2017, along with President Rodrigo Duterte. Most viral news were driven by shares on networks of Facebook pages. Also, most Philippine audience Facebook pages and groups spreading online disinformation bore &quot;Duterte&quot;, &quot;Marcos&quot; or &quot;News&quot; in their names and are pro-Duterte.

In July 2020, Brittany Kaiser alleged in an interview that Marcos had approached the controversial firm Cambridge Analytica in order to &quot;rebrand&quot; the Marcos family image on social media. Marcos&#x27;s spokesperson Vic Rodriguez denied these allegations and stated that Marcos is considering filing libel charges against Rappler, which published Kaiser&#x27;s interview.

===Impostor urban legend===
Between the late 70s and early 80s, an urban legend became popular claiming that Marcos Jr. was stabbed and died during a scuffle while studying abroad. The Marcos family allegedly looked for Bongbong&#x27;s look-alike to replace him. This was later debunked by Marcos in one of his vlogs. The origins of this urban legend remain unknown.

===Tallano gold myth===

In 1990, during a coverage of Imelda Marcos&#x27;s trial in New York, Inquirer journalist Kristina Luz interviewed then-33-year-old exiled Bongbong Marcos and asked where the Marcos wealth came from. Marcos responded &quot;only I know where the gold is and how to get it&quot;. This was corroborated in a 1992 report by the Associated Press that quoted Imelda Marcos saying that her husband&#x27;s wealth came &quot;from the Japanese and other gold he found after World War II, and not from the Philippine coffers.&quot; In 2007, Marcos informed the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan that his father&#x27;s wealth came from trading &quot;precious metals more specifically gold from the years 1946 to 1954&quot; when he tried to win back the Ortigas Payanig property in Pasig from the national government.

The myth surrounding the gold allegedly owned by the Marcos family has been the subject of various misinformation, as in 2011, a Facebook post claimed that a certain &quot;Tallano clan&quot; had paid Ferdinand Marcos Sr. in gold for his legal services. Several years later, supporters of the Marcos family in a Facebook page called &quot;Marcos Cyber Warriors&quot; also claimed that Marcos Sr.&#x27;s wealth came from his former law client, the &quot;Maharlikan Tallano family&quot;.

This has resulted in a long-running belief that should Bongbong Marcos win as president, he will give Filipinos a share of this gold. However during his Philippine presidential election campaign in the 2022 elections, when asked over One News to verify the mythical &quot;Tallano gold&quot; or the long-believed tale that they got a share of the Japanese Yamashita gold, Marcos denied knowledge of it, even joking that &quot;people should let him know if they see any of that gold&quot;. The urban myth had allegedly been suggested or carried by various social media pages being run by Marcos supporters in order to engage more people to support his presidential bid.

==Personal life==
Marcos is married to lawyer Louise &quot;Liza&quot; Cacho Araneta, a member of the prominent Araneta family. Marcos and Araneta were married in Fiesole, Italy, on April 17, 1993. They have three sons: Ferdinand Alexander III &quot;Sandro&quot; (born 1994), Joseph Simon (born 1995) and William Vincent &quot;Vinny&quot; (born 1997). Although he is Ilocano by ethnic ancestry, he was brought up in a Manileño household and does not speak the Ilocano language. The Marcos family maintains a residence in Forbes Park, Makati.

Aside from his common nickname &quot;Bongbong&quot;, Marcos is known by his peers as &quot;Bonggets&quot;. Marcos is an avid listener of rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and jazz music. He once held a record collection in Malacañang Palace that he described as &quot;the best record collection in the Philippines&quot; but left it when his family was exiled from the country in 1986. He is a fan of the Beatles, citing &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; as his favorite album of theirs, and often collects the band&#x27;s memorabilia. Marcos can also play the saxophone.

Marcos exercises regularly and claims to abstain from consuming confections and soft drinks. Marcos is also an avid reader, a cinephile, and a gun enthusiast, where he holds a competition under his name. He follows Formula One racing as a supporter of Scuderia Ferrari; during his presidency, he attended the 2022 and 2023 Singapore Grand Prix with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and other foreign dignitaries.

On March 31, 2020, Marcos&#x27;s spokesperson confirmed that Marcos had tested positive for COVID-19. Prior to getting tested, Marcos was reportedly experiencing chest pains after coming home from a trip to Spain. He has since recovered from the disease after testing negative on a RT-PCR test on May 5, 2020, a month after testing positive for COVID-19. On July 8, 2022, Marcos&#x27;s press secretary confirmed that Marcos had tested positive again for COVID-19 after experiencing slight fever.

===Alleged cocaine usage===
On November 18, 2021, President Rodrigo Duterte claimed in a televised speech that a certain candidate for the 2022 Philippine presidential election is allegedly using cocaine, hinting at the candidate using male pronouns on several instances. Furthermore, Duterte alleged that the candidate eluded law enforcement authorities by doing drugs on a private yacht and a plane. Although he did not name the candidate, it was alluded that Duterte was referring to Marcos after he continued on his speech that the male candidate is a &quot;weak leader&quot; and has been &quot;capitalizing on his father&#x27;s accomplishments&quot;. Prior to that, Duterte previously named Marcos a &quot;weak leader who had done nothing&quot; and a &quot;spoiled child for being an only son&quot;.

Days after Duterte&#x27;s allegation, Marcos took a cocaine drug test through a urine sample at St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center – Global City and submitted the negative result to law enforcement authorities with a follow-up online memo by the medical institution confirming the legitimacy of the test.

Marcos responded that he did not feel that he was the one alluded to by President Duterte. According to health care provider American Addiction Centers, after the last use, cocaine or its metabolites can show up on a blood or saliva test for up to two days, a urine test for up to three days, and a hair test for months to years. In an interview with CNN Philippines in April 2022, Marcos responded to Duterte&#x27;s remarks on him being a &quot;spoiled&quot; and &quot;weak leader&quot;, saying that the president was &quot;playing politics&quot; and was &quot;always making sure everybody&#x27;s thinking hard about what they&#x27;re doing&quot;.

In an interview with ANC in May 2022, former senator Nikki Coseteng, who claimed to personally know Marcos, alleged that Marcos was a &quot;lazy individual&quot; who frequented discos and got high on illegal substances along with his socialite friends during his youth. Marcos has neither denied nor confirmed Coseteng&#x27;s allegations.

In late January 2024, Marcos&#x27;s alleged cocaine use was brought anew by Duterte, during a prayer rally against Charter change in Davao City. Duterte alleged that Marcos had once been included in the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency&#x27;s (PDEA) drug watchlist (which the agency denied) and had been spotted using cocaine with his cohorts at a giant banana firm&#x27;s plantation in Davao del Norte when Duterte was Mayor. Duterte said that these companions of Marcos were already working for his administration, and cited this as the reason why he did not vote for him in the 2022 general election. When asked by Marcos to prove the allegations, Duterte retorted that it is incumbent upon him to prove the allegations by taking a drug test, since he is the one holding public office. Marcos maintained he had never used illegal narcotics, let alone cocaine, and blamed Duterte&#x27;s use of fentanyl as a response. In Duterte&#x27;s defense, he had used fentanyl because it was prescribed to him by a &quot;Dr. Javier&quot;, his alleged physician at St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center – Quezon City, to alleviate pain from injuries sustained in a motorbike accident a few years ago.

===PDEA leaks===
In April 2023, leaked documents from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) circulated online, linking Marcos and actress Maricel Soriano to illegal drugs. The Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs, headed by Senator Ronald dela Rosa, later conducted a hearing on the matter and invited vlogger Maharlika to explain her involvement in the online circulation of the documents. Former PDEA investigation agent Jonathan Morales declared that the documents were authentic; PDEA Director General Moro Virgilio Lazo, on the other hand, claimed the documents were fake.

On May 20, 2024, the Philippine Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs panel cited PDEA agent Jonathan Morales in contempt for &#x27;&quot;continuously lying&quot;. Upon Jinggoy Estrada&#x27;s motion and seconded by Ronald dela Rosa, Morales was ordered detained for flipped-flopped replies on PDS, inter alia. Earlier, a former National Police Commission officer, Eric &quot;Pikoy&quot; Santiago was also held in contempt of the Senate for being a &quot;liar&quot;. On May 23, 2024, Morales and Santiago were released from custody according to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Roberto Ancan. In August 2024, San Fernando, Pampanga Municipal Trial Court Branch 9 Acting Presiding Judge Jason Alquiroz convicted Morales of perjury and sentenced him to four months imprisonment and fined .

<text>Tomales Bay is a long, narrow inlet of the Pacific Ocean in Marin County in northern California in the United States.

== Geography ==
Tomales Bay is approximately long and averages nearly wide, with relatively shallow depths averaging 18 ft, effectively separating the Point Reyes Peninsula from the mainland of Marin County. It is located approximately northwest of San Francisco. The bay forms the eastern boundary of Point Reyes National Seashore. Tomales Bay is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy. On its northern end, it opens out onto Bodega Bay, which shelters it from the direct currents of the Pacific (especially the California Current). The bay is formed along a submerged portion of the San Andreas Fault. The fault divides the Point Reyes Peninsula through Tomales Bay in the north, and the Bolinas Lagoon in the south. The Bear Valley Visitor Center in Point Reyes Station is home to the Earthquake Trail, where visitors can see a visible rift formed on the fault during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

Towns bordering Tomales Bay include Inverness, Tomales, Inverness Park, Point Reyes Station, and Marshall. Additional hamlets include Nick&#x27;s Cove, Spengers, Duck Cove, Shallow Beach, and Vilicichs. Dillon Beach lies just to the north of the mouth of the bay, and Tomales just to the east.

== Beaches ==
California State Parks department monitored, surf-free beaches on the bay include Heart&#x27;s Desire, Shell Beach, Indian Beach, Pebble Beach, and Millerton Point. Most beaches require a hike-in, so if visiting, prepare with walkable shoes. Swimming, picnicking, sailing, kayaking, motorboating, and fishing are all popular activities on the bay. 

== Water sports, oystering, and fishing ==
Watercrafts may be launched on Tomales Bay from the public boat ramp at Nick&#x27;s Cove, north of Marshall. The sandbar at the mouth of Tomales Bay is notoriously dangerous, with a long history of small-boat accidents.
Oyster farming is a major industry on the bay. The two largest producers are Hog Island Oyster Company and Tomales Bay Oyster Company, both of which retail oysters to the public and have picnic grounds on the east shore. Hillsides east of Tomales Bay are grazed by cows belonging to local dairies. There is also grazing land west of the bay, on farms and ranches leased from Point Reyes National Seashore.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught here, based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species.

== Biology ==
The bay is home to many aquatic species, and its habitat diversity is supported by eelgrass beds and intertidal mudflats. In the bay’s waters, bony and cartilaginous fish species including halibut, coho salmon, bat rays and leopard sharks can be found. Along muddy parts of bay&#x27;s shore, it is common to find the gastropods such as the invasive False Cerith snail, recognizable from its dextrally coiled shape and brown-gray pattern.

==History==

=== Coast Miwok ===
The area surrounding Tomales Bay was once the territory of the Coast Miwok tribe. Documented villages in the area included &quot;Echa-kolum&quot; (south of Marshall), &quot;Sakloki&quot; (opposite Tomales Point), &quot;Shotommo-wi&quot; (near the mouth of the Estero de San Antonio), and &quot;Utumia&quot; (near Tomales). The tribe&#x27;s history is deeply rooted in the bay and its surrounding areas. Fishing and hunting supported their liveilhood, and shells and clams collected from the bay&#x27;s shore served as currency. 

=== Francis Drake ===
Francis Drake is thought to have landed in nearby Drakes Estero in 1579. Members of the Vizcaíno Expedition found the Bay in 1603, and thinking it a river, named it &quot;Rio Grande de San Sebastian&quot;.

=== European settlements ===
Early 19th-century settlements constituted the southernmost Russian colony in North America and were spread over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay.

=== Railroad ===
The narrow gauge North Pacific Coast Railroad from Sausalito was constructed along the east side of the bay in 1874 and extended to the Russian River until it was dismantled in 1930.

=== Preservation efforts ===
Tomales Bay State Park was formed to preserve some of the bay shore; it opened to the public in 1952. 

The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971, listed Tomales Bay as a wetland of international importance.

The Giacomini Wetland Restoration Project, completed in 2008, returned to wetland several hundred acres at the south end of the bay that had been drained for grazing in the 1940s.
=== Lodge at Marconi ===

The Marconi State Historical Park (formerly Marconi Conference Center State Historic Park) preserves a small hotel built in 1913 by Guglielmo Marconi to house personnel who staffed his transpacific radio station nearby. RCA purchased the station from Marconi in 1920, and it closed in 1939, though other nearby radio stations on the Point Reyes Peninsula still operate today. It was purchased by a private foundation and given to the state in 1984 to operate as a conference center.

<doc id="572465" wikidata="Q1994957" url="?curid=572465" title="Alan Cranston">
<text>Alan MacGregor Cranston (June 19, 1914 – December 31, 2000) was an American politician and journalist who served as a United States Senator from California from 1969 to 1993, and as President of the World Federalist Association from 1949 to 1952.

Born in Palo Alto, California, Cranston worked as a journalist after graduating from Stanford University. After serving as California State Controller, he was elected to the Senate in 1968. He served as the Senate Democratic Whip from 1977 to 1991. In 1984, Cranston sought the Democratic presidential nomination, advocating a nuclear freeze during the later stages of the Cold War. He dropped out after the first set of primaries.

In 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee reprimanded Cranston for his role in the savings and loan crisis as a member of the Keating Five. After being diagnosed with prostate cancer, he decided not to run for a fifth term. After his retirement from the Senate, he served as president of the Global Security Institute and advocated for the global abolition of nuclear weapons.

==Early life and education==
Cranston was born in Palo Alto, California, the son of Carol (née Dixon) and William MacGregor Cranston. He attended Pomona College for one year and studied abroad for a summer at the National Autonomous University of Mexico before graduating from Stanford University in 1936 with a degree in English.

==Early career==

Cranston was a correspondent for the International News Service for two years before World War II. When an abridged English-language translation of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; was released, sanitized to exclude some of Hitler&#x27;s anti-Semitism and militancy, Cranston published a different translation (with annotations) that he believed reflected the contents of the book more accurately. In 1939, Hitler&#x27;s publisher sued him for copyright violation in Connecticut; a judge ruled in the publisher&#x27;s favor and publication of the book was halted, but by then a half million copies had been sold, helping inform a wide audience about the threat Hitler posed.

Before enlisting in the armed forces in 1944, Cranston worked as an editor and writer for the magazine &quot;Common Ground&quot;, and later in the Office of War Information. Enlisting in the army as a private in 1944, he requested service with a combat unit after completing Infantry basic training, but was instead assigned to be editor of &quot;Army Talk&quot; magazine. While on active duty, he wrote a second book, &quot;The Killing of the Peace&quot;, a synopsis of the failed bid to get the United States to join the League of Nations immediately after World War I. Cranston held the rank of sergeant when he was discharged at the end of the war in 1945.

A supporter of world government, Cranston attended the 1945 conference that led to the Dublin Declaration. He organized California chapters of the UWF and served as the president of the national UWF from 1949 to 1952. He successfully pushed the California legislature to pass the 1949 World Federalist California Resolution, calling on Congress to amend the Constitution to allow U.S. participation in a federal world government. Also in the late 1940s, Cranston began his longstanding opposition to nuclear weapons.

In 1952, Cranston co-founded the California Democratic Council (CDC), and served as chairman. Since that time, the CDC has served as an unofficial coalition of local Democratic clubs that coordinate electoral activities and activism throughout California. The CDC provided substantial support to Cranston in his bid for State Controller in 1958 and his numerous runs for the U.S. Senate.

==Public office==

===State Controller===
A Democrat, Cranston was elected California State Controller in 1958, reelected in 1962, and defeated for reelection in 1966.

===U.S. Senator===

Cranston first ran for the United States Senate in 1964. He lost the Democratic primary to former White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger, who went on to lose the general election to Republican George Murphy.

In 1968, Cranston was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Senate, defeating Republican state Superintendent of Schools Max Rafferty in the general election after the staunchly conservative Rafferty had narrowly defeated the liberal Republican incumbent, Thomas Kuchel, in that party&#x27;s primary.

The election was marred by mudslinging. A conservative writer, Frank Capell, authored a pamphlet suggesting that Cranston might have had Communist leanings in his youth, and that during his stint at the Office of War Information he helped falsely convince Franklin D. Roosevelt that Nazi Germany had perpetrated the Katyń massacre. Many of the same allegations were recycled in an article that ran in &quot;American Opinion&quot; in 1974 titled &quot;Alan Cranston: The Shadow in the Senate&quot;. (The article&#x27;s title was a reference to Lamont Cranston, the main character in the popular radio program &quot;The Shadow&quot;.)

During his first few months in office, Cranston introduced a resolution calling for President Nixon to halt closing 59 Job Corps Centers. He amended the original resolution to include a June 30 deadline that would allow Congress to do a study of the targeted facilities and removed language criticizing the Nixon administration for damaging trainees&#x27; lives by closing the facilities. In April 1969, the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee approved the revised Cranston proposal in a vote of 10 to 6. Cranston predicted victory for the resolution when it was taken up for a vote by the entire chamber, but the Senate defeated it on May 13, 1969, by a vote of 52 to 40.

In a September 12, 1971 statement, Cranston disputed the Pentagon&#x27;s claims that military manpower and national security would be threatened if Congress did not renew Nixon&#x27;s draft authority and said he would filibuster the draft measure.

In September 1973, Cranston introduced an amendment that would reduce American forces overseas by 20% in the next 18 months and would include naval forces. It was introduced as a fallback amendment to the 40% reduction in American forces overseas Senator Mike Mansfield had offered.

In November 1973, Cranston announced his support for the nomination of Gerald Ford as vice president. He said his support came after consulting &quot;several hundred persons—Democrats and Republicans, business and labor leaders, elected politicians and party functionaries—in his own state of California&quot; and finding little opposition to Ford.

On April 23, 1974, Cranston stated that members of the Veterans Administration had been encouraged to contribute to Nixon&#x27;s reelection campaign and that head of the Veterans Administration Donald E. Johnson was privy to these activities. Cranston&#x27;s allegations were corroborated later that day by a former VA employee.

In 1974, Cranston defeated Republican H.L. &quot;Bill&quot; Richardson, a conservative state senator previously affiliated with the John Birch Society. Cranston polled 3,693,160 votes (60.5%) to Richardson&#x27;s 2,210,267 (36.2%).

In 1979, after 19 senators signed a letter indicating that their support for the SALT II treaty hinged on President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s response to its impact on U.S. defense posture, Cranston said their concerns were legitimate but mostly did not &quot;relate directly to the text of the SALT II treaty&quot; and it was likely that their reservations about the treaty could be resolved without using killer amendments.

In 1980, Cranston defeated Republican Paul Gann, 4,705,399 (56.5%) to 3,093,426 (37.1%). His campaign was notable for a July 31 benefit that was the last concert the Eagles played at together for 14 years. During the event Cranston&#x27;s wife thanked Eagles guitarist Don Felder for performing, to which Felder reportedly replied, &quot;You&#x27;re welcome...I guess.&quot; Bandmate Glenn Frey took exception to Felder&#x27;s comment, leading to onstage bickering and the band&#x27;s breakup immediately after the concert.

In March 1981, Cranston was one of 24 elected officials to issue a joint statement calling on the Reagan administration to find a peaceful solution to the Ulster conflict.

In April 1981, during a Senate floor speech, Cranston asserted that India and Pakistan had entered the final stages of their preparation for nuclear test sites, speculating that India &quot;will decide to make another test at the Pokaran site in the next few months&quot; and Pakistan &quot;could produce the fissile materials for a similar test, perhaps by the end of this year, most likely by the end of 1982.&quot; He did not identify the source of his information, but senior Reagan administration officials verified &quot;the gist of Senator Cranston&#x27;s information.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called Cranston a &quot;bald, craggy-looking, none-too-charismatic man.&quot;

Cranston was reelected in 1986, narrowly defeating Republican nominee Congressman Ed Zschau after an expensive and heated election.

On October 2, 1990, Cranston was one of nine senators to vote against the nomination of David Souter for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

===Presidential candidate===
Cranston was Democratic Whip from 1977 to 1991.

He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1984 election. He became the first announced candidate on February 1, 1983. Despite his age (69) and appearance that seemed even older (he dyed his little remaining white hair a color that most called orange), Cranston quickly became a recognized candidate. His strong support for a nuclear freeze won him an intense following among anti-nuclear activists, support that translated into campaign donations, committed staff (future Washington Senator Maria Cantwell moved to the state in 1983 to head up Cranston&#x27;s caucus campaign effort there) and volunteers and straw poll victories in Wisconsin, California, and Alabama. However, the entry of George McGovern into the race in September 1983 cut into Cranston&#x27;s support. He finished a weak fourth in Iowa in February 1984 and dropped out a week later after finishing seventh out of eight candidates in New Hampshire, with only two percent of the vote.

Cranston also faced a campaign debt of $2 million from his 1984 run as he began gearing up for an expensive and tough re-election fight in 1986, when he narrowly defeated the liberal Republican U.S. Representative Ed Zschau, who later left the Republican Party.

===Reprimand===
On November 20, 1991, Cranston was reprimanded by the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics for &quot;improper conduct&quot; after Lincoln Savings head Charles Keating&#x27;s companies contributed $850,000 to voter registration groups closely affiliated with Cranston. Keating had wanted federal regulators to stop &quot;hounding&quot; his savings and loan association. Although the committee found that &quot;no evidence was presented to the Committee that Senator Cranston ever agreed to help Mr. Keating in return for a contribution&quot;, the committee deemed Cranston&#x27;s misconduct the worst among the Keating Five.

Cranston announced his retirement from the Senate in 1991, citing his diagnosis of prostate cancer as the reason. However, it was widely speculated that his decision not to seek re-election was strongly influenced by the fallout from the savings and loan scandal. His involvement with Charles Keating and the subsequent Senate Ethics Committee reprimand had severely damaged his public image. Polls suggested that if he ran again in 1992, he would likely lose. His successor in the Senate, Barbara Boxer, later expressed doubt that he would have stepped down if not for the Keating scandal.

===Track and field===
Throughout his public life, Cranston was notable for practicing and participating in the sport of track and field as a sprinter in special senior races. Many of the events, races for senior sprinters at major track meets, were the early events that became the sport of masters athletics. While on his many political trips, Cranston would spend time sprinting in long hotel hallways to maintain his fitness.

== Personal life ==
Cranston&#x27;s family was wealthy, with investments in real estate. He married and divorced twice. His first wife, Geneva McMath, was the mother of his sons, Kim and Robin. The elder Robin died in 1980 in a Los Angeles traffic accident.

Cranston later married Norma Weintraub. Weintraub was afflicted by Parkinson’s disease. The two divorced in 1989.

==Retirement and death==
After retiring from the Senate, Cranston, a former Democratic presidential contender in 1984, largely stepped out of public view. He spent his later years dedicated to the global abolition of nuclear weapons, which had been central to his political career. In 1996, he became chairman of the Gorbachev Foundation USA, a San Francisco-based think tank founded by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to advance world peace and nuclear arms control. He also served as Chairman of the State of the World Forum, where he led efforts for nuclear disarmament through the Nuclear Weapon Elimination Initiative of the State of the World Forum. In 1999, he founded the Global Security Institute, a non-profit organization aiming for the global abolition of the use of nuclear weapons.

He lived in Los Altos, California, from his retirement until his death on December 31, 2000. Although Cranston had prostate cancer in the early 1990s, his son later stated that he had successfully overcome the illness and ultimately passed away from natural causes unrelated to the cancer.

==Political positions==
Cranston received a score of 100% from the AFL-CIO in 1969, 1970, 1972, and 1981 while his lowest score was 79% in 1977. His lowest score from Americans for Democratic Action was 72% in 1969 and his highest was 95% in 1982. The United States Chamber of Commerce gave him a score of 0% from 1969 to 1973, and in 1976.

<text>, also known as Patlabor (a portmanteau of &quot;patrol&quot; and &quot;labor&quot;), is a Japanese science fiction media franchise created by Headgear, a group consisting of manga artist Masami Yūki, director Mamoru Oshii, screenwriter Kazunori Itō, mecha designer Yutaka Izubuchi, and character designer Akemi Takada.

The popular franchise includes a manga, a TV series, two OVA series, three feature-length movies, two light novel series, and a short film compilation, named because of its super deformed (chibi) drawing style. The series has been adapted into video games and licensed products from OST to toys. &quot;Patlabor&quot; is known for using mecha – designed by Yutaka Izubuchi – not just for police or military purposes, but also for industrial and municipal jobs. 

The series is one of the earlier examples of what is called a &quot;media mix&quot; in Japan, where there is no one source material: Multiple forms of media (in &quot;Patlabor&quot;&#x27;s case the anime and manga) are worked on at the same time independently of each other.

==Plot==
The story takes place in what was, at the time of release, the near future of 1998–2002. Robots called &quot;Labors&quot; are employed in heavy construction work. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police has its own fleet of Patrol Labors (&quot;Patlabors&quot;; as opposed to patrol cars) to combat crimes/terrorism and deal with accidents involving Labors. The story arcs usually revolve around Tokyo Metropolitan Police Special Vehicle Section 2, Division 2. Noa Izumi is the main protagonist of the series, but all of Division 2 play roles. Hata and Kusumi are the main protagonists of the third &quot;Patlabor&quot; film. 

&quot;The Next Generation&quot; takes place in 2013, with an entirely new cast with the exception of Shige and Buchiyama in maintenance, but the new members of SV2 have similar names and personalities to the old ones.

The feature films follow a separate continuity, referred to as the &quot;movie timeline&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;TV timeline&quot;, with the &quot;Early Days&quot; OVA following the &quot;movie timeline&quot;, and the &quot;New Files&quot; OVA following the &quot;TV timeline&quot;. In addition, the manga follows its own continuity.

&quot;The Next Generation&quot; features episodes that directly reference the TV series, while its final episode and movie are a direct sequel to the second movie.

===Anime===
====&quot;The Early Days&quot;====
*&quot;Patlabor: The Early Days&quot; (1988–1989, OVA mini-series, 7 episodes)
Originally known in Japan as &quot;Mobile Police Patlabor&quot;. Details the origins of the Tokyo MPD&#x27;s 2nd Special Vehicles Section, otherwise known as SV2.

====Movies====
*&quot;&quot; (1989)
A series of random labor incidents across the Greater Tokyo Area puts the SV2 on the case. The incidents turn out to be part of a dead programmer&#x27;s diabolical plot to create a much bigger rampage.

*&quot;Patlabor 2: The Movie&quot; (1993)
A secret group of terrorists engineer a crisis in Tokyo in the winter of 2001–2002. The members of SV2&#x27;s Section 2, who have been reassigned to other duties since the events of &quot;WXIII&quot;, reunite one more time to stop the threat.

*&quot;&quot; (2002)
Taking place a year after &quot;Patlabor: The Movie&quot;, the film features two MPD detectives who investigate the case of missing scientists working on a genetic engineering project that runs amok in Tokyo Bay. SV2&#x27;s Section 2 is later called in to help rein in the danger.

====&quot;The TV Series&quot; and &quot;The New Files&quot;====
*&quot;&quot; (1989–1990, TV, 47 episodes)
Taking place in a different continuity, the series features more adventures of SV2 Section 2, which includes an arc involving their efforts to combat an advanced Schaft Enterprises Labor called the Type J9 Griffon.

*&quot;&quot; (1990–1992, OVA, 16 episodes)
Also referred to as &quot;Patlabor 2&quot;, the series contains episodes that took place at several points between certain episodes in the TV series and after the latter&#x27;s final episode. The OVA also features the conclusion of the Griffon story arc.

A three-part series of short films known as &quot;Mobile Police Patlabor Minimum: Minipato&quot; were shown before screenings of &quot;WXIII&quot; in 2002, &quot;Minipato&quot; uses paper puppets, CGI, and claymation to explain the rationale behind the whole concept of the series, especially how the Labors functioned in a realistic hard science fiction setting.

====&quot;Patlabor REBOOT&quot;====
&quot;Kidō Keisatsu Patlabor REBOOT&quot; is a short animated film released as part of Japan Animator Expo 2016 featuring a modernised version of &quot;Patlabor&quot; with new characters and utilising CG for the Labors, animated by Studio Khara and Studio Rikka.

====&quot;Patlabor EZY&quot;====
On November 24, 2016, it was announced that a new &quot;Patlabor&quot; project had started. &quot;Patlabor EZY&quot; was announced at Annecy International Animated Film Festival in 2017. Kazunori Ito said on his Twitter account in June 2017 that he is involved in the project. In August 2018, GENCO opened social media accounts to promote &quot;Patlabor EZY&quot;.

A pilot was reported to have debuted in August 2022. During the &quot;Mobile Police Patlabor Bucchake Talk!&quot; event at Wonder Festival 2022, Yutaka Izubuchi said that &quot;EZY&quot; is set to debut in 2024.

In October 2023, MOVeLOT revealed that they&#x27;re working on an Ingram-type mech in relation to &quot;EZY&quot;. They invited anyone to follow their social media accounts for updates on the progress. They reported in June 2024 that a working Ingram will be publicly unveiled in August with a ceremony held in mid-September.

On September 12, 2024, the two-minute pilot was shown at theater screenings for the first &quot;Patlabor&quot; movie in Japan.

The show&#x27;s staff announced on September 20, 2024 that it will be produced by J.C.Staff and will air in 2026.

===Live-action series===

At the 2013 Tokyo Anime Fair, Tohokushinsha Film Corporation announced a live-action &quot;Patlabor&quot; project to be launched in 2014. On July 4, 2013, Mamoru Oshii announced that he would be involved in the project, in an unspecified capacity.

On September 25, 2013, it was announced that Japanese actors Erina Mano would star as pilot Akira Izumino, Seiji Fukushi as Yūma Shiobara, Rina Oota as Ekaterina Krachevna Kankaeva (&quot;Kasha&quot;), Shigeru Chiba reprising his anime role as chief Shigeo Shiba and Toshio Kakei as Captain Keiji Gotōda.

Called &quot;The Next Generation: Patlabor&quot;, the project consisted of a drama series and movie. The drama series is divided into 14 &quot;short story&quot; episodes released to blu-ray and DVD and exclusively aired on BS Digital and Star Channel airing from 2014 and 2015, with limited advanced theatrical screenings dividing the series into 7 &quot;chapters&quot;, each comprising two episodes. The movie released in theaters on May 1, 2015, and a director&#x27;s cut version of the movie was released on October 10, 2015.

&quot;The Next Generation&quot; takes place in the &quot;Patlabor&quot; world&#x27;s version of 2013 Tokyo, and is a sequel to the TV series, the OVA series and the second movie. The completion of the Babylon Project led to disuse of Labors, and Japan is in the midst of a recession. Labors falling into disuse also means there is also no place for the patrol labor squads, which have been shrunk to only one division.

The drama series follows the new members of SV2 as they solve cases and get into trouble like their predecessors did.

In the movie, followers of Yukihito Tsuge carry out terrorist attacks on Tokyo, re-enacting Tsuge&#x27;s coup, and SV2 has to stop them.

==Licensing==
All of the main &quot;Patlabor&quot; anime productions have been released overseas in some form. All the movies have been translated into English and are available in Region 1, 2 &amp; 4 DVD format. Most of the manga is not available in North America in English, and the video games, novels and live action series have also not been released outside of Japan.

The TV series and OVAs were released in the U.S. by Central Park Media. The first two movies were released by Manga Entertainment, but later remastered and re-released in 2006 by Bandai Visual. The third movie (along with &quot;Mini-Pato&quot;) was released by Geneon Entertainment (formerly Pioneer). Twelve sections of the manga have been translated and published by Viz Communications as single issues and in two trade paperbacks, but later dropped the manga before completing it.

Mini-Pato is available on DVD in regions 1, 2, and 4 in the Limited Edition &quot;Patlabor WXIII&quot; DVD packages.

In 2006, Bandai Visual&#x27;s Honneamise label re-released the first two movies on DVD in North America with extensive bonus features and an alternate English track, and Beez Entertainment handled distribution in the UK.

Madman has the distribution rights for the movies in Australia and New Zealand in association with Manga Entertainment UK &amp; TFC, Madman have been refused the rights to the Bandai Visual dubs of the films. In 2011, Madman Entertainment announced that they had secured the rights to the Early Days OVA series and the TV series from TFC, but announced on April 13, 2012, that due to unforeseen circumstances, Madman had indefinitely delayed their release into Australia and did not elaborate on the reasons. However, Madman has since rescheduled the first OVA for DVD and Blu-ray release on June 19, 2013. In July 2013, MVM Films has licensed the first OVA &amp; TV series for distribution in the UK and will release them on Blu-ray and DVD.

In 2013, Maiden Japan (in conjunction with Section23 Films) acquired the licence to the &quot;Patlabor&quot; OAV series, and released it on Blu-ray and DVD on April 30, 2013. They subsequently licensed and released the TV series on July 16, 2013; the second OVA series on February 17, 2015; and all of the films, with the first film released on May 5, 2015.

==Headgear==
 is a group consisting of five main writers and artists who work in the Japanese anime/manga field. The group was set up so that all the creators could retain full copyright to their work, achieve greater publicity for their work and sell their manga to anime sponsors for film production. The members are Masami Yuki, Yutaka Izubuchi, Kazunori Itō, Akemi Takada, and Mamoru Oshii. Together they worked on the anime series &quot;Patlabor&quot; and the two episode OVA &quot;Twilight Q&quot;.

Other staff involved with Headgear include Kenji Kawai, Naoyuki Yoshinaga, Takayama Fumihiko, Kenji Kamiyama, and Miki Tori.

==Reception and legacy==

The manga received the 36th Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen in 1991. Guillermo del Toro has cited the series as an influence for &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;. In 2018, the Japan Anniversary Association recognized August 10 as &quot;Patlabor Day&quot;.

<text>Festina is a Spanish watch conglomerate. In 1985, businessman Miguel Rodríguez acquired Festina, a brand founded in Switzerland in 1902, thus forming the &quot;Festina-Lotus Group.&quot;

==History==

Festina was created in 1902 by the Stüdi family in the city of La Chaux-de-Fonds, in Switzerland. In 1935 the founding-family transmitted the brand to businessman, Willy Burkhard von Wilhelm.

During World War II, the company was based in Barcelona, Spain. In 1975, Georges Uhlmann, an entrepreneur who had a significant presence in the Spanish and Italian markets, acquired the firm. In 1984, the Spanish businessman Miguel Rodríguez, from La Linea de la Concepción (Cadiz), acquired the Festina brand and all its rights.

The Festina brand derived from the Latin &quot;&quot;Festina lente&quot; which means: &quot;Make haste, slowly&quot;&quot;, a phrase that according to Roman historian, Suetonius, is attributed to Augustus Caesar, known for his prudence: &quot;Walk slowly if you want to arrive at a well-done job sooner&quot;.

Within the Festina Group the brands Jaguar, Candino and Perrelet are Swiss-made. In 2002, Festina acquired the Swiss watch brand Candino.
In 2004, Festina acquired the luxury watch brand, Perrelet, founded in 1777 by the prestigious watchmaker Abraham-Louis Perrelet.

==Marketing==
In 1992, Festina became the official Timekeeper of the Tour de France until 2016, staying for decades closely linked to the world of cycling as a sponsor / timekeeper of the most important events of the cycling agenda (Tour of Spain, Tour of Britain, etc.).

Festina has sponsored the German football club TSV 1860 Munich between 2005 and 2006.

In 2016, actor Gerard Butler became an ambassador of the brand and image of its campaigns worldwide thus moving its brand positioning towards the lifestyle category.

== Festina Group ==

With more than 30 years of history, Festina Group is today an international company specialized in the production and commercialization of commercial price range watches and precision parts.

The Group currently owns seven different brands of watches. Calypso, Lotus, Festina, Jaguar, Candino and two luxury brands Perrelet and L.Leroy. Festina also owns two jewelry brands, Lotus Style and Lotus Silver, to satisfy the demands of a wide range of public.

The Group&#x27;s headquarters is located in Madrid, while the main production centers, owned by the Group, are located in Switzerland and Spain.
Today the Group, which has seven subsidiaries (France, Germany, Italy, Benelux, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Poland and Chile) is present in more than 90 countries on five continents with more than 5 million watches sold per year.

<doc id="572482" wikidata="Q598758" url="?curid=572482" title="Allison Engine Company">
<text>The Allison Engine Company was an American aircraft engine manufacturer. Shortly after the death of James Allison in 1929 the company was purchased by the Fisher brothers. Fisher sold the company to General Motors, which owned it for most of its history. It was acquired by Rolls-Royce plc in 1995 to become the US subsidiary, Rolls-Royce North America.

==History==
A predecessor of Allison Engine Company, the Concentrated Acetylene Company, was founded in September 1904 by James Allison, Percy C. &quot;Fred&quot; Avery and Carl G. Fisher. Avery was the holder of the patent for the product. This company was the predecessor of the Prest-O-Lite Company, a manufacturer of acetylene headlights. An explosion at the acetylene gas works in downtown Indianapolis caused the company to relocate out of town, near the race track in Speedway, Indiana. Allison and Fisher raced automobiles at that track, each owning a race car team. This hobby resulted in Allison building a shop at the track in Speedway where he maintained his fleet of race cars. This shop became the site for Allison Plant #1. Fisher and Allison sold their interest in Prest-O-Lite to Union Carbide for $9,000,000.

===Allison Speedway Team Company===
Allison started as an engine and car &quot;hot rodding&quot; company servicing the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis. James Allison was the owner of the Indianapolis Speedway Team Company, a race car business in Indianapolis, Indiana. While it was founded as the Indianapolis Speedway Team Company, its name changed numerous times, first to the Allison Speedway Team Company, then the Allison Experimental Company and last as the Allison Engineering Company before becoming a division of General Motors.

The company&#x27;s only regular production item was a patented steel-backed lead bearing, which was used in various high performance engines. It also built various drive shafts, extensions and gear chains for high power engines, on demand. Later its main business was the conversion of older Liberty engines to more powerful models, both for aircraft and marine use.

Allison needed a place where his race car engines could be modified and repaired. On January 1, 1917 Allison moved into a building at what was to become, in later years, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Along with the move, Allison hired Norman H. Gillman, a very talented engineer from a competing race team, as his chief engineer.

===Allison&#x27;s move to Florida===
Allison moved to Florida to invest in real estate after World War I, leaving Gillman in charge. Allison did not want the company to wither, so he asked Gillman to build a V-12 marine engine worthy of the Allison name. Gillman then proceeded to build an engine that relied on what was learned from building and modifying the venerable Liberty engine.

Allison&#x27;s company was sold to Captain Eddie Rickenbacker in 1927 for $700,000 after Allison moved to Florida. In 1929, shortly after the death of James Allison, the company was purchased by the Fisher brothers. The Fishers sold the company to General Motors, who owned it for most of its history. The Allison Engine Company was acquired in 1995 by Rolls-Royce plc, and became the Rolls-Royce Corporation subsidiary.

===Hyper engine===
In the late 1920s the United States Army funded the development of a series of high-power engines, as part of its hyper engine series, which it intended to produce on Continental Motors&#x27; production lines. Allison&#x27;s manager, Norman Gilman, decided to experiment with his own high-power cylinder design. Allison&#x27;s engine became Manufacturer Serial No. 1, AAC S/N 25-521. It was the X-4520, a 24-cylinder air-cooled 4-bank “X” configured engine designed by the Army Air Corps and built by the Allison Engineering Company in 1925. The result was presented to the Army in 1928, which turned down the development proposal.

===General Motors===
In 1929, shortly after the death of James Allison, the company was purchased by the Fisher brothers, who instructed it to use the cylinder design for a six-cylinder engine for a &quot;family aircraft&quot;. Before work on this design had progressed very far, Fisher sold the company to General Motors, which ended development owing to financial pressures of the Great Depression. Nevertheless, Gilman pressed ahead with the cylinder design, building a &quot;paper project&quot; V-12 engine. The Army was once again uninterested, but instead suggested Allison try selling it to the United States Navy. The Navy agreed to fund development of A and B models to a very limited degree for its airships, until the crash of the USS &quot;Macon&quot; in 1935, when the Navy&#x27;s need for a engine disappeared.

====V-1710====

The very first V-1710 was purchased by the U.S. Navy as their GV-1710-2, and appears to have had an Allison serial of number 1, suggesting that they restarted numbering for the V-1710. The first V-1710 engine purchased by the USAAC was AAC 33-42, Allison Serial No. 2, the XV-1710-1, while Serial Nos. 3, 4, 5 were V-1710-4 engines for U.S. Navy airships, followed by a batch of 11 Air Corps engines purchased with FY-1934 funds (34-4 through 34-14) that covered Allison serials 6 through 16. After these the production race was on, totaling over 70,000 V-1710s.

By this time the Army had become more interested in the design, and asked Allison to continue with a new &quot;C&quot; model. They had few funds of their own to invest, and Allison supported much of the development out of their own pocket. The V-1710-C first flew on 14 December 1936 in the Consolidated A-11A testbed. The V-1710-C6 completed the Army 150 hour Type Test on 23 April 1937, at 1,000 hp (750 kW), the first engine of any type to do so. By then all of the other Army engine projects had been cancelled or withdrawn, leaving the V-1710 as the only modern design available. It was soon found as the primary power plant of the new generation of United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) fighters, the P-38 Lightning, P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Warhawk.

The Army had been leaning heavily towards exhaust-driven turbochargers, instead of the more common mechanically driven superchargers, favoring the theoretical advantage of using the otherwise wasted energy in the exhaust. Thus, little effort was invested in equipping the V-1710 with a complex two-stage supercharger, and when placed in aircraft designs like the P-39 or P-40, which lacked the room for a turbocharger, the engine suffered tremendously at higher altitudes. It was for this reason in particular that the V-1710 was later removed from the P-51 Mustang and replaced with the Rolls-Royce Merlin.

===Post-war===
With the need for the V-1710 winding down at the end of the war, Allison found itself with a large production infrastructure that was no longer needed. For this reason, in 1947, the Army decided to take General Electric&#x27;s versions of Frank Whittle&#x27;s jet engines and give them to Allison to produce instead. The main production model was GE&#x27;s I-40, produced as the Allison J33. By the time production ended in 1955, Allison had produced over 7,000 J33s.

Allison also took over GE&#x27;s axial flow engine design, becoming the Allison J35. The J35 was the primary powerplant for the F-84 Thunderjet and F-89 Scorpion, as well as appearing on numerous prototype designs. The J35 also finished production in 1955, by which point over 14,000 had been delivered.

Allison also began development of a series of turboprop engines for the U.S. Navy, starting with the T38 and a &quot;twinned&quot; version as the T40. The Navy was interested only in the T40, but the complexities of the drive shaft arrangement doomed the engine and the project was eventually cancelled. Allison tried again with the T56, basically an enlarged T38 with the power of the T40, and was eventually rewarded when this engine was selected to power the C-130 Hercules. Allison turboprop engines were also used to re-engine Convair prop airliners which resulted in the Convair 580 turboprop passenger aircraft which was widely used by local service and regional airlines in the U.S. such as Allegheny Airlines, the original Frontier Airlines, North Central Airlines, as well as major carriers American, Eastern, United, and Pan-Am.

Over the years a family of engines based on the T56 configuration was developed, culminating in the T406/Allison AE1107 turboshaft for the V-22 Osprey, the Allison AE2100 turboprop, used on newer models of the C-130 and the Allison/Rolls-Royce AE 3007 turbofan which propels many regional airline aircraft, such as the Embraer ERJ 135, ERJ 140 and ERJ 145 family of regional passenger jets that continue to be widely used in the airline industry.

One of Allison&#x27;s most successful projects is the Model 250 turboshaft/turboprop engine family, which was started by the company in the early 1960s, when helicopters started to be powered by turbine, rather than reciprocating, engines. Allison turbine engines were used to power Bell 206 Jet Ranger and Long Ranger helicopters as well as the initial version of the Sikorsky S-76 helicopter.

===Experiments===
In the mid-1970s the Allison Division of General Motors Corporation in Detroit designed ceramic components into the Allison GT 404-4 turboshaft engine intended for trucks. Allison continued to work with General Motors on development of ceramic-turbine powered engines until the early 1990s. During their work they were able to engineer fairly stable automobile engines that were capable of burning a variety of fuels, such as gasoline, Diesel, kerosene, alcohol, vegetable oil, and coal powder.

In the 1980s Allison collaborated with Pratt &amp; Whitney on demonstrating the 578-DX propfan. Unlike the competing General Electric GE-36 UDF, the 578-DX was fairly conventional, having a reduction gearbox between the LP turbine and the propfan blades. Noise considerations, plus a significant reduction in the real cost of aviation fuel, brought the NASA funded program to a halt.

In 1995, Allison tested a prototype lift fan for the Joint Strike Fighter Program and a LiftFan nozzle was tested in 1997 at NASA&#x27;s Lewis facility. By 1997, a complete prototype had been demonstrated by the Rolls-Royce owned but American-controlled Allison Advanced Development Company.

===Automotive use===
In 1965 a drag racer, Jim Lytle, created a car known as &quot;Quad Al&quot; which incorporated four World War II surplus V-12 Allison aero-engines in a four-wheel drive configuration, and developing approximately . Although its engines started, it never ran; the creator could not afford the custom gearboxes and clutches required to handle the enormous torque generated by the engines. The car survives, without its engines, in Indiana, USA.

===Acquisition by Rolls-Royce===
In 1992 General Motors tried to sell Allison to concentrate on rebuilding automobile market share. Rolls-Royce attempted to buy the company in 1993, but General Motors opted for a management buyout instead for $370 million.

In 1995 US authorities approved, with restrictions on Joint Strike Fighter Program, the purchase of Allison by Rolls-Royce. The price was $525 million. In the year 2000, some of these restrictions were alleviated, and in 2001 the US government chose the F-35 with Rolls-Royce LiftFan and Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engines. Allison was also a partner with General Electric and Rolls-Royce on the F136 Fighter Engine Team.

<text>In combinatorial mathematics, the Bell polynomials, named in honor of Eric Temple Bell, are used in the study of set partitions. They are related to Stirling and Bell numbers. They also occur in many applications, such as in Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula.

==Definitions==

===Exponential Bell polynomials===
The &quot;partial&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot; exponential Bell polynomials are a triangular array of polynomials given by

:formula_1

where the sum is taken over all sequences &quot;j&quot;1, &quot;j&quot;2, &quot;j&quot;3, ..., &quot;j&quot;&quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot;+1 of non-negative integers such that these two conditions are satisfied:

:formula_2 
:formula_3

The sum

:formula_4

is called the &quot;n&quot;th &quot;complete exponential Bell polynomial&quot;.

===Ordinary Bell polynomials===
Likewise, the partial &quot;ordinary&quot; Bell polynomial is defined by
:formula_5
where the sum runs over all sequences &quot;j&quot;1, &quot;j&quot;2, &quot;j&quot;3, ..., &quot;j&quot;&quot;n&quot;−&quot;k&quot;+1 of non-negative integers such that
:formula_6
:formula_7

Thanks to the first condition on indices, we can rewrite the formula as
:formula_8

where we have used the multinomial coefficient.

The ordinary Bell polynomials can be expressed in the terms of exponential Bell polynomials:
:formula_9

In general, Bell polynomial refers to the exponential Bell polynomial, unless otherwise explicitly stated.

==Combinatorial meaning==

The exponential Bell polynomial encodes the information related to the ways a set can be partitioned. For example, if we consider a set {A, B, C}, it can be partitioned into two non-empty, non-overlapping subsets, which are also referred to as parts or blocks, in 3 different ways:
:

Thus, we can encode the information regarding these partitions as

:formula_10

Here, the subscripts of &quot;B&quot;3,2 tell us that we are considering the partitioning of a set with 3 elements into 2 blocks. The subscript of each &quot;x&quot;i indicates the presence of a block with &quot;i&quot; elements (or block of size &quot;i&quot;) in a given partition. So here, &quot;x&quot;2 indicates the presence of a block with two elements. Similarly, &quot;x&quot;1 indicates the presence of a block with a single element. The exponent of &quot;x&quot;ij indicates that there are &quot;j&quot; such blocks of size &quot;i&quot; in a single partition. Here, the fact that both &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 have exponent 1 indicates that there is only one such block in a given partition. The coefficient of the monomial indicates how many such partitions there are. Here, there are 3 partitions of a set with 3 elements into 2 blocks, where in each partition the elements are divided into two blocks of sizes 1 and 2.

Since any set can be divided into a single block in only one way, the above interpretation would mean that &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;,1 = &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Similarly, since there is only one way that a set with &quot;n&quot; elements be divided into &quot;n&quot; singletons, &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;n&quot; = &quot;x&quot;1&quot;n&quot;.

As a more complicated example, consider

:formula_11

This tells us that if a set with 6 elements is divided into 2 blocks, then we can have 6 partitions with blocks of size 1 and 5, 15 partitions with blocks of size 4 and 2, and 10 partitions with 2 blocks of size 3.

The sum of the subscripts in a monomial is equal to the total number of elements. Thus, the number of monomials that appear in the partial Bell polynomial is equal to the number of ways the integer &quot;n&quot; can be expressed as a summation of &quot;k&quot; positive integers. This is the same as the integer partition of &quot;n&quot; into &quot;k&quot; parts. For instance, in the above examples, the integer 3 can be partitioned into two parts as 2+1 only. Thus, there is only one monomial in &quot;B&quot;3,2. However, the integer 6 can be partitioned into two parts as 5+1, 4+2, and 3+3. Thus, there are three monomials in &quot;B&quot;6,2. Indeed, the subscripts of the variables in a monomial are the same as those given by the integer partition, indicating the sizes of the different blocks. The total number of monomials appearing in a complete Bell polynomial &quot;Bn&quot; is thus equal to the total number of integer partitions of &quot;n&quot;.

Also the degree of each monomial, which is the sum of the exponents of each variable in the monomial, is equal to the number of blocks the set is divided into. That is, &quot;j&quot;1 + &quot;j&quot;2 + ... = &quot;k&quot; . Thus, given a complete Bell polynomial &quot;Bn&quot;, we can separate the partial Bell polynomial &quot;Bn,k&quot; by collecting all those monomials with degree &quot;k&quot;.

Finally, if we disregard the sizes of the blocks and put all &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, then the summation of the coefficients of the partial Bell polynomial &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot; will give the total number of ways that a set with &quot;n&quot; elements can be partitioned into &quot;k&quot; blocks, which is the same as the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Also, the summation of all the coefficients of the complete Bell polynomial &quot;Bn&quot; will give us the total number of ways a set with &quot;n&quot; elements can be partitioned into non-overlapping subsets, which is the same as the Bell number.

In general, if the integer &quot;n&quot; is partitioned into a sum in which &quot;1&quot; appears &quot;j&quot;1 times, &quot;2&quot; appears &quot;j&quot;2 times, and so on, then the number of partitions of a set of size &quot;n&quot; that collapse to that partition of the integer &quot;n&quot; when the members of the set become indistinguishable is the corresponding coefficient in the polynomial.

===Examples===

For example, we have

:formula_12

because the ways to partition a set of 6 elements as 2 blocks are

:6 ways to partition a set of 6 as 5 + 1,
:15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 4 + 2, and
:10 ways to partition a set of 6 as 3 + 3.

Similarly,

:formula_13

because the ways to partition a set of 6 elements as 3 blocks are

:15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 4 + 1 + 1,
:60 ways to partition a set of 6 as 3 + 2 + 1, and
:15 ways to partition a set of 6 as 2 + 2 + 2.

==Table of values==

Below is a triangular array of the incomplete Bell polynomials formula_14:
==Properties==

===Generating function===
The exponential partial Bell polynomials can be defined by the double series expansion of its generating function:
:formula_15

In other words, by what amounts to the same, by the series expansion of the &quot;k&quot;-th power:
:formula_16
The complete exponential Bell polynomial is defined by formula_17, or in other words:
:formula_18

Thus, the &quot;n&quot;-th complete Bell polynomial is given by
:formula_19

Likewise, the &quot;ordinary&quot; partial Bell polynomial can be defined by the generating function
:formula_20

Or, equivalently, by series expansion of the &quot;k&quot;-th power:
:formula_21

See also generating function transformations for Bell polynomial generating function expansions of compositions of sequence generating functions and powers, logarithms, and exponentials of a sequence generating function. Each of these formulas is cited in the respective sections of Comtet.

===Recurrence relations===

The complete Bell polynomials can be recurrently defined as
:formula_22
with the initial value formula_23.

The partial Bell polynomials can also be computed efficiently by a recurrence relation:
:formula_24
where
:formula_25
:formula_26
:formula_27

In addition:

:formula_28

When formula_29,
:formula_30

The complete Bell polynomials also satisfy the following recurrence differential formula:
: formula_31

===Derivatives===

The partial derivatives of the complete Bell polynomials are given by
: formula_32

Similarly, the partial derivatives of the partial Bell polynomials are given by
: formula_33

If the arguments of the Bell polynomials are one-dimensional functions, the chain rule can be used to obtain
: formula_34
===Stirling numbers and Bell numbers===

The value of the Bell polynomial &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;2...) on the sequence of factorials equals an unsigned Stirling number of the first kind:
:formula_35
The sum of these values gives the value of the complete Bell polynomial on the sequence of factorials:
:formula_36

The value of the Bell polynomial &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;2...) on the sequence of ones equals a Stirling number of the second kind:
:formula_37

===Convolution identity===

For sequences &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, ..., define a convolution by:

:formula_38

The bounds of summation are 1 and &quot;n&quot; − 1, not 0 and &quot;n&quot; .

Let formula_39 be the &quot;n&quot;th term of the sequence

:formula_40

Then

:formula_41

For example, let us compute formula_42. We have

:formula_43

:formula_44

:formula_45

and thus,

:formula_46

==Other identities==

* formula_47 which gives the idempotent number.
* formula_48.
* The complete Bell polynomials satisfy the binomial type relation:
*:formula_49
*:formula_50
:This corrects the omission of the factor formula_51 in Comtet&#x27;s book.
* Special cases of partial Bell polynomials:

:formula_52

==Examples==

The first few complete Bell polynomials are:

:formula_53

==Applications==

===Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula===
Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula may be stated in terms of Bell polynomials as follows:

:formula_54

Similarly, a power-series version of Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula may be stated using Bell polynomials as follows. Suppose

:formula_55

Then

:formula_56

In particular, the complete Bell polynomials appear in the exponential of a formal power series:

:formula_57
which also represents the exponential generating function of the complete Bell polynomials on a fixed sequence of arguments formula_58.

===Reversion of series===
Let two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; be expressed in formal power series as

:formula_59

such that &quot;g&quot; is the compositional inverse of &quot;f&quot; defined by &quot;g&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;w&quot;)) = &quot;w&quot; or &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)) = &quot;z&quot;. If &quot;f&quot;0 = 0 and &quot;f&quot;1 ≠ 0, then an explicit form of the coefficients of the inverse can be given in term of Bell polynomials as

:formula_60

with formula_61 and formula_62 is the rising factorial, and formula_63

===Asymptotic expansion of Laplace-type integrals===
Consider the integral of the form

:formula_64

where (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;) is a real (finite or infinite) interval, λ is a large positive parameter and the functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are continuous. Let &quot;f&quot; have a single minimum in [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] which occurs at &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot;. Assume that as &quot;x&quot; → &quot;a&quot;+,

:formula_65
:formula_66

with &quot;α&quot; &gt; 0, Re(&quot;β&quot;) &gt; 0; and that the expansion of &quot;f&quot; can be term wise differentiated. Then, Laplace–Erdelyi theorem states that the asymptotic expansion of the integral &quot;I&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) is given by

:formula_67

where the coefficients &quot;cn&quot; are expressible in terms of &quot;an&quot; and &quot;bn&quot; using partial &quot;ordinary&quot; Bell polynomials, as given by Campbell–Froman–Walles–Wojdylo formula:

:formula_68

===Symmetric polynomials=== 

The elementary symmetric polynomial formula_69 and the power sum symmetric polynomial formula_70 can be related to each other using Bell polynomials as:
: formula_71
: formula_72
These formulae allow one to express the coefficients of monic polynomials in terms of the Bell polynomials of its zeroes. For instance, together with Cayley–Hamilton theorem they lead to expression of the determinant of a &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; square matrix &quot;A&quot; in terms of the traces of its powers: 
: formula_73

===Cycle index of symmetric groups===
The cycle index of the symmetric group formula_74 can be expressed in terms of complete Bell polynomials as follows:
:formula_75

===Moments and cumulants===

The sum

:formula_76

is the &quot;n&quot;th raw moment of a probability distribution whose first &quot;n&quot; cumulants are &quot;κ&quot;1, ..., &quot;κ&quot;&quot;n&quot;. In other words, the &quot;n&quot;th moment is the &quot;n&quot;th complete Bell polynomial evaluated at the first &quot;n&quot; cumulants. Likewise, the &quot;n&quot;th cumulant can be given in terms of the moments as

:formula_77

===Hermite polynomials===
Hermite polynomials can be expressed in terms of Bell polynomials as

:formula_78

where &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; 2; thus allowing for a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients of the Hermite polynomials. This can be seen by comparing the generating function of the Hermite polynomials

:formula_79

with that of Bell polynomials.

===Representation of polynomial sequences of binomial type===

For any sequence &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, …, &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; of scalars, let

:formula_80

Then this polynomial sequence is of binomial type, i.e. it satisfies the binomial identity

:formula_81
:Example: For &quot;a&quot;1 = … = &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1, the polynomials formula_82 represent Touchard polynomials.

More generally, we have this result:

:Theorem: All polynomial sequences of binomial type are of this form.

If we define a formal power series

:formula_83

then for all &quot;n&quot;,

:formula_84

<text>Clerical fascism (also clero-fascism or clerico-fascism) is an ideology that combines the political and economic doctrines of fascism with clericalism. The term has been used to describe organizations and movements that combine religious elements with fascism, receive support from religious organizations which espouse sympathy for fascism, or fascist regimes in which clergy play a leading role.

== History ==
The term &quot;clerical fascism&quot; (clero-fascism or clerico-fascism) emerged in the early 1920s in the Kingdom of Italy, referring to the faction of the Roman Catholic Partito Popolare Italiano (PPI) which supported Benito Mussolini and his régime. It was supposedly coined by Don Luigi Sturzo, a priest and Christian democrat leader who opposed Mussolini and went into exile in 1924, although the term had also been used before Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome in 1922 to refer to Catholics in Northern Italy who advocated a synthesis of Roman Catholicism and fascism.

Sturzo made a distinction between the &quot;filofascists&quot;, who left the Catholic PPI in 1921 and 1922, and the &quot;clerical fascists&quot; who stayed in the party after the March on Rome, advocating collaboration with the fascist government. Eventually, the latter group converged with Mussolini, abandoning the PPI in 1923 and creating the Centro Nazionale Italiano. The PPI was disbanded by the fascist régime in 1926.

The term has since been used by scholars seeking to contrast authoritarian-conservative clerical fascism with more radical variants. Christian fascists focus on internal religious politics, such as passing laws and regulations that reflect their view of Christianity. Radicalized forms of Christian fascism or &quot;clerical fascism&quot; (clero-fascism or clerico-fascism) were emerging on the far-right of the political spectrum in some European countries during the interwar period in the first half of the 20th century.

=== Fascist Italy ===

In 1870, the newly formed Kingdom of Italy annexed the remaining Papal States, depriving the Pope of his temporal power. However, in the 1929 Lateran Treaty, Mussolini recognized the Pope as sovereign ruler of the Vatican City state, and Roman Catholicism became the state religion of Fascist Italy.

In March 1929, a nationwide plebiscite was held to publicly endorse the Lateran Treaty. Opponents were intimidated by the fascist regime: the Catholic Action organisation (&quot;Azione Cattolica&quot;) and Mussolini claimed that &quot;no&quot; votes were of those &quot;few ill-advised anti-clericals who refuse to accept the Lateran Pacts&quot;. Nearly nine million Italians voted, or 90 per cent of the registered electorate, and only 136,000 voted &quot;no&quot;.

Almost immediately after the signing of the Treaty, relations between Mussolini and the Church soured again. Mussolini &quot;referred to Catholicism as, in origin, a minor sect that had spread beyond Historical Palestine only because grafted onto the organization of the Roman empire.&quot; After the concordat, &quot;he confiscated more issues of Catholic newspapers in the next three months than in the previous seven years.&quot; Mussolini reportedly came close to being excommunicated from the Catholic Church around this time.

In 1938, the Italian Racial Laws and &quot;Manifesto of Race&quot; were promulgated by the fascist regime to persecute Italian Jews as well as Protestant Christians, especially Evangelicals and Pentecostals. Thousands of Italian Jews and a small number of Protestants died in the Nazi concentration camps.

Despite Mussolini&#x27;s close alliance with Hitler&#x27;s Germany, Italy did not fully adopt Nazism&#x27;s genocidal ideology towards the Jews. The Nazis were frustrated by the Italian authorities&#x27; refusal to co-operate in the round-ups of Jews, and no Jews were deported prior to the formation of the Italian Social Republic following the Armistice of Cassibile. In the Italian-occupied Independent State of Croatia, German envoy Siegfried Kasche advised Berlin that Italian forces had &quot;apparently been influenced&quot; by Vatican opposition to German anti-Semitism. As anti-Axis feeling grew in Italy, the use of Vatican Radio to broadcast papal disapproval of race murder and anti-Semitism angered the Nazis. When Mussolini was overthrown in July 1943, the Germans moved to occupy Italy and commenced a round-up of Jews.

Around 4% of Resistance forces were formally Catholic organisations, but Catholics dominated other &quot;independent groups&quot; such as the &quot;Fiamme Verdi&quot; and &quot;Osoppo&quot; partisans, and there were also Catholic militants in the Garibaldi Brigades, such as Benigno Zaccagnini, who later served as a prominent Christian Democrat politician. In Northern Italy, tensions between Catholics and communists in the movement led Catholics to form the &quot;Fiamme Verdi&quot; as a separate brigade of Christian Democrats. After the war, the ideological divisions between former partisans re-emerged, becoming a hallmark of post-war Italian politics.

== Examples of clerical fascism ==


Examples of political movements which incorporate certain elements of clerical fascism into their ideologies include:

* the Fatherland Front in Austria led by Austrian Catholic Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg.
* the Rexist Party in Belgium led by Léon Degrelle, a Belgian Catholic.
* the Brazilian Integralist Action in Brazil led by Brazilian Catholic Plínio Salgado.
* the Nationalist Liberation Alliance in Argentina led by .
* the Ustaše movement led by Poglavnik and Prime Minister Ante Pavelić in the Independent State of Croatia and its supporters in the Croatian Catholic Church.
* the Lapua Movement and the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement (IKL) in Finland led by the Lutherans (körtti) Vihtori Kosola and Vilho Annala respectively. Pastor Elias Simojoki led the IKL&#x27;s youth organization the Blue-and-Blacks.
* the German Christians of the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany led by Ludwig Müller which attempted but failed to unify German Protestants during the &quot;Kirchenkampf&quot;.
* Metaxism and the 4th of August Regime in Greece which was led by Ioannis Metaxas and heavily supported the Greek Orthodox Church.
* the National Synarchist Union in Mexico led by Mexican Catholic José Antonio Urquiza before his assassination in 1938, it was a revival of the Catholic reaction that triggered the Cristero War; midcentury, the movement would become the focus of a conspiracy theory which alleged that it had infiltrated various institutions under the name El Yunque. 
* the National Radical Camp in Poland led by Boleslaw Piasecki, Henryk Rossman, Tadeusz Gluzinski and Jan Mosdorf which heavily incorporated Polish Catholicism into its ideology, especially the Falangist faction.
* the National Union in Portugal led by Prime Ministers António de Oliveira Salazar and Marcelo Caetano. 
* the National-Christian Defense League/Iron Guard of Romania, which was led by the devoutly Romanian Orthodox Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.
* Serbian Action, an ultranationalist and clerical fascist movement, active in Serbia since 2010.
* the Slovak People&#x27;s Party (Ľudaks) in Slovakia led by President Jozef Tiso, a Catholic priest.
* the FET y de las JONS of Spain led by Spanish Catholic Francisco Franco, which developed into National Catholicism.
* the Silver Legion of America in the United States led by William Dudley Pelley which combined American Christianity (specifically Protestantism) with American white nationalism.
The National Union in Portugal led by Prime Ministers António de Oliveira Salazar and Marcelo Caetano is not considered Fascist by historians such as Stanley G. Payne, Thomas Gerard Gallagher, Juan José Linz, António Costa Pinto, Roger Griffin, Robert Paxton and Howard J. Wiarda, though it is considered Fascist by historians such as Manuel de Lucena, Jorge Pais de Sousa, Manuel Loff, and Hermínio Martins. One of Salazar&#x27;s actions was to ban the National Syndicalists/Fascists. Salazar distanced himself from fascism and Nazism, which he criticized as a &quot;pagan Caesarism&quot; that did not recognise either legal or moral limits.

Likewise, the Fatherland Front in Austria led by Austrian Catholic Chancellors Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg is often not regarded as a fully fascist party. It has been called semi-Fascist and even imitation Fascist. Dollfuss was murdered by the Nazis, shot in his office by the SS and left to bleed to death. Initially, his regime received support from Fascist Italy, which formed the Stresa Front with the United Kingdom and France.

===Use of the term===
Scholars who accept the use of the term &quot;clerical fascism&quot; debate about which of the listed examples should be dubbed &quot;clerical fascist&quot;, with the Ustaše being the most widely included example. In the examples which are cited above, the degree of official Catholic support and the degree of clerical influence over lawmaking and government both vary. Moreover, several authors reject the concept of a &quot;clerical fascist régime&quot;, arguing that an entire fascist régime does not become &quot;clerical&quot; if elements of the clergy support it, while others are not prepared to use the term &quot;clerical fascism&quot; outside the context of what they call the &quot;fascist epoch&quot;, between the ends of the two world wars (1918–1945).

Some scholars consider certain contemporary movements forms of clerical fascism, such as Christian Identity and Christian Reconstructionism in the United States; &quot;the most virulent form&quot; of Islamic fundamentalism, Islamism; and militant Hindu nationalism in India.

The political theorist Roger Griffin warns against the &quot;hyperinflation of clerical fascism&quot;. According to Griffin, the use of the term &quot;clerical fascism&quot; should be limited to &quot;the peculiar forms of politics that arise when religious clerics and professional theologians are drawn either into collusion with the &quot;secular&quot; ideology of fascism (an occurrence particularly common in interwar Europe); or, more rarely, manage to mix a theologically illicit cocktail of deeply held religious beliefs with a fascist commitment to saving the nation or race from decadence or collapse&quot;. Griffin adds that &quot;clerical fascism&quot; &quot;should never be used to characterize a political movement or a regime in its entirety, since it can at most be a faction within fascism&quot;, while he defines fascism as &quot;a revolutionary, secular variant of ultranationalism bent on the total rebirth of society through human agency&quot;.

In the case of the Slovak State, some scholars have rejected the use of the term clerical fascism as a label for the regime and they have particularly rejected the use of the term clerical fascist as a label for Jozef Tiso.

<text>Ba-awa is a variant of the game of mancala originating in Ghana. Although played in some of the same regions as Oware, it is simpler and in traditional societies is considered a game for women and children. Ba-awa is related to games j&#x27;erin and obridjie played in Nigeria. It is also similar to mancala game anywoli played at the Ethiopian-Sudanese border. 

== Rules ==
These are the rules as used by the Twi, an Akan people from Ghana.

=== Equipment ===
The Ba-awa board has six pits in front of each player, and (optionally) one pit at each end which stores captured seeds. 

The only pieces are 48 undifferentiated seeds or other small objects.

=== Setup ===
Typically, several games are played in a row.

At the beginning of the first game four seeds are placed in each pit except the end pits. Subsequent games also begin with four seeds in each pit, however the ownership of the pits may have changed.

=== Object ===
The nominal object of a match is to gain control of all the pits on the board; however, this is so hard the game is usually only played to ten or eleven pits.

=== Sowing ===
Players take turns moving the seeds. On a turn, a player chooses one of the pits under their control. The player removes all seeds from this pit, and distributes them in each pit counter-clockwise from this pit, in a process called &quot;sowing&quot;. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring pits. If the last seed ends in an occupied pit, then all the seeds in that pit including the last one are resown starting from that pit. These multiple turns continue until the sowing process ends, either in an empty pit or a capture of four seeds.

=== Capturing ===
If at any time during sowing, a pit has exactly four seeds, all four are immediately captured and removed from play. There can be many such captures during sowing. Also, if the last pit sown into then has four seeds, these four seeds are captured and the sowing process ends.

== End of the game ==
When there are just eight seeds left on the board, the player who began the game takes these and the game ends. In the next game, each player begins with a pit for each four seeds captured. Since captures are always made in multiples of four, this will be even.</text><links>

<text>Bao is a traditional mancala board game played in most of East Africa including Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Comoros, Malawi, as well as some areas of DR Congo and Burundi. It is most popular among the Swahili people of Tanzania and Kenya; the name itself &quot;Bao&quot; is the Swahili word for &quot;board&quot; or &quot;board game&quot;. In Tanzania, and especially Zanzibar, a &quot;bao master&quot; (called &quot;bingwa&quot;, &quot;master&quot;; but also &quot;fundi&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;) is held in high respect. In Malawi, a close variant of the game is known as Bawo, which is the Yao equivalent of the Swahili name.

Bao is well known to be a prominent mancala in terms of complexity and strategical depth, and it has raised interest in scholars of several disciplines, including game theory, complexity theory, and psychology. Official tournaments are held in Tanzania, Zanzibar, Lamu (Kenya), and Malawi, and both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar have their Bao societies, such as the Chama cha Bao founded in 1966.

In Zanzibar and Tanzania there are two versions of Bao. The main version, which is also the most complex and most appreciated, is called Bao la kiswahili (&quot;Bao of the Swahili people&quot;). The simplified version is called Bao la kujifunza (&quot;Bao for beginners&quot;). There are a variety of other mancalas across East Africa (and part of the Middle East) that are related to Bao. One of them is the Hawalis game of Oman; it is also known in Zanzibar, where it goes by the name &quot;Bao la kiarabu&quot; (&quot;Bao of the Arabs&quot;). Another major relative of Bao is Omweso (played in Uganda), which uses equipment similar to Bao, and has similar rules.

==History==

As with most traditional mancalas, precise historical information on the origins and diffusion of Bao is missing. Early accounts and archaeological findings are arguable as there are many games that are similar to Bao in both equipment and rules. For example, a 1658 account by French governor Étienne de Flacourt about a game played by the Sakalava people in northwestern Madagascar is sometimes quoted as the earliest reference to Bao, but scholars are more cautious about identifying Flacourt&#x27;s game with Bao proper. The study of archaeological findings of boards usually relies on the assumption that boards having a square hole in a certain position (that of the &quot;nyumba&quot;, see below) are associated to Bao, as it is the only known mancala to have such feature. Nevertheless, as traditional boards are made of wood, ancient evidence of the game of Bao is unlikely to be found. As of today, the oldest Bao board is supposed to be one from Malawi, exposed at the British Museum, and dating back to no earlier than 1896. One of the first written accounts of Bao as played in the Swahili world is due to British orientalist Thomas Hyde, who saw it played in 1658 in Anjouan (Comoros).

Due to its strong relationship with Swahili culture, and despite the lack of historical evidences, it is reasonable to assume that Bao originally spread from the Swahili coast (i.e., the coast Tanzania and Kenya, and their islands). It is also notable that &quot;Bao la kiswahili&quot; means &quot;swahili board game&quot; as opposed to, for example, &quot;Bao la kiarabu&quot; (the related &quot;arab board game&quot;, also known as Hawalis). In the 1820s, Swahili poet Muyaka bin Haji from Mombasa celebrated the game in his poem &quot;Bao Naligwa&quot;.

==Rules==
As with most traditional games, the rules of Bao were only preserved by oral tradition, and as a consequence, they are subject to local variations. The most influential transcription of the rules is due to board game scholar Alex de Voogt, who wrote it between 1991 and 1995 based on the teachings of Zanzibari Bao masters.

===Equipment===

Bao comprises four rows of eight pits each—in Swahili, pits are termed &quot;mashimo&quot; (singular: &quot;shimo&quot;), meaning &quot;holes&quot;. Each player owns a half of the board comprising two adjacent rows. 

Some pits that play a special role in the game have specific names. The fourth rightmost pit in the &quot;inner&quot; row of each half board is called &quot;nyumba&quot; (&quot;house&quot;) or &quot;kuu&quot; (&quot;main&quot;); in most traditional boards, it is visually distinguished by a square shape. The first and last pit of the inner row are called &quot;kichwa&quot; (&quot;head&quot;), while the name &quot;kimbi&quot; applies to both the kichwa and the pits adjacent to them (i.e., the second and next to last pit in the row).

Each player has 32 undifferentiated counters (or &quot;seeds&quot; according to the standard mancala terminology) that are termed &quot;kete&quot; (&quot;shells&quot;). Note that a similar equipment (a 4x8 board and 64 seeds) is shared by a number of other African mancalas, including Omweso (Uganda) and Isolo (Tanzania).

The initial setup of seeds is one of the elements that distinguish different versions of the game.

===Setup===
In Bao la kiswahili, each player initially places 6 seeds in the nyumba, and two seeds in each of the two pits immediately to the right of the nyumba. All the remaining seeds are kept &quot;in hand&quot;. In Malawi, 8 seeds are placed in the nyumba. Thus each player has respectively 22 or 20 seeds in hand at the beginning of the game. These seeds are introduced into the game in a first phase of play called the &quot;namua&quot; phase.

In Bao la kujifunza, all seeds are placed at startup, two per pit. Players thus have no seeds in hand, and thus there is no namua phase.

===Namua===
In the namua phase, each player begins his or her move by introducing one of the seeds he or she has in hand into the board. The seed must be placed in a non-empty pit in the player&#x27;s inner row.

A &quot;marker&quot; pit is a pit of the inner row that faces a non-empty opponent&#x27;s pit. If the first seed is placed in a marker pit, a &quot;capture&quot; occurs, and the player&#x27;s turn will be called a &quot;mtaji&quot; turn. Otherwise, the turn will be called a &quot;takata&quot; turn. A player must capture if he or she can do so. In a mtaji turn, other captures may occur as a consequence of sowing (see below); in a takata turn, on the other hand, captures may not occur.

===Capture and sowing===

When a capture occurs, the player takes all of the seeds from the opponent&#x27;s captured pit, and relay sows them in his or her rows. The first seed must be sown in a kichwa; if it is sown in the right kichwa, sowing will proceed counterclockwise, while if it is sown in the left kichwa, sowing will be clockwise. For this reason, the right kichwa is also called &quot;counterclockwise kichwa&quot; and the left one &quot;clockwise kichwa&quot;.

The choice of the kichwa to sow from is initially left to the player, with a few exceptions. If capture has occurred in any kimbi, sowing must start from the closest kichwa.

While the player is relay-sowing, if the last seed in any individual sowing is placed in a marker, a new capture occurs. Sowing of the captured seeds will start again from a kichwa. In this case, it is never up to the player to choose which kichwa to sow from, that is: if the capture occurred in a kimbi, sowing must start from the closest kichwa, as above; otherwise, the player must preserve the current clockwise or counterclockwise direction of sowing. That is, if a capture occurs at the end of a clockwise sowing, the newly captured seeds will have to be sown starting from the clockwise kichwa, and vice versa.

If the turn is not a mtaji turn, relay sowing, but captures will never take place: marker pits are treated just like any other pits.

In any case, the turn ends when the last seed in a sowing is dropped in an empty pit.

===Mtaji phase===
When players are left without seeds in their hands, the namua phase is over, and a new phase of the game begins, which is called the &quot;mtaji&quot; phase. Note that the word &quot;mtaji&quot; is used both to refer to a turn and to a game phase; the two meanings must not be confused. Also note that in Bao la kujifunza, the game begins with the mtaji phase, as there are no seeds in hand.

In the mtaji phase, the player will begin his or her turn taking all the seeds from any pit that has at least 2 seeds, and sows them (either clockwise or counterclockwise). If the last seed of this first sowing is dropped in a marker, a mtaji &quot;turn&quot; begins, with the same rules described above. Again, if the marker is a kimbi, sowing will be from the closest kichwa; otherwise, the player will have to preserve the clockwise or counterclockwise orientation of the sowing that caused the capture.

As for the namua phase, the player must capture if he or she can do so.

If the first sowing does not lead to a capture, the whole turn is a &quot;takata turn&quot;, exactly as in the namua phase. In this case, the player must start sowing from a pit in the inner row, if this is possible.

As a special rule, if the first sowing is from a pit that has more than 15 seeds, the turn will always be &quot;takata&quot; irrespective of whether the last seed falls in a marker or not.

===The nyumba===
In Bao la kiswahili there are some extra rules (not included in Bao la kujifunza) that are related to the nyumba. First, if sowing in a takata turn ends up in the nyumba, the turn is over (there is no &quot;relay-sowing&quot; of the seeds in the nyumba). Second, likewise, if sowing in a mtaji turn ends up in the nyumba, and the nyumba is not a marker, the player may freely choose whether to relay-sow the contents of the nyumba or end his or her turn. Third, if, during the namua phase, the player begins his turn sowing from the nyumba, he will only sow two seeds from the nyumba rather than its whole content. This is called &quot;taxing&quot; the nyumba.

The nyumba loses its special features the first time its contents are sown (taxation excluded), i.e., the first time the player chooses to relay-sow from the nyumba in a mtaji turn, or if it is captured by the opponent.

There are some variations to these rules. For example, taxing the nyumba is sometimes allowed only if there is no other legal way to begin a player&#x27;s turn. Also, in some versions of the Bao relay-sowing of the nyumba in a mtaji turn is mandatory rather than optional.

===End of the game===
The game ends when a player is left without seeds in his or her inner row, or when he or she cannot move anymore. In both cases, this player loses the game.

==Terminology==
In Swahili literature on Bao, the following terms are commonly used:
* &quot;kete&quot;: the seeds.
* &quot;kichwa&quot;: the first and last pits in a player&#x27;s inner row.
* &quot;kimbi&quot;: the first two and last two pits in a player&#x27;s inner row, i.e., the kichwa pits as well the pits adjacent to them. In some cases, the term &quot;kimbi&quot; is only used for the second and next to last pits in the inner row, i.e., kichwa pits are not included as kimbi pits.
* &quot;mtaji&quot;: referring to a turn, is a turn that begins with a capture, and that may include further captures. Referring to a phase of the game, is the phase where there are no seeds left in hand. Some sources also use &quot;mtaji&quot; to refer to a group of seeds that, when sown, lead to a capture.
* &quot;namua&quot;: the initial phase of Bao la kiswahili, when seeds &quot;in hand&quot; are introduced into the game.
* &quot;nemo&quot;: the seeds in hand
* &quot;nyumba&quot;: the fourth pit from the right in a player&#x27;s inner row; usually distinguished by a square pit.
* &quot;shimo&quot; (plur. &quot;mashimo&quot;): pit(s).
* &quot;takata&quot;: refers to a turn that does not begin with a capture and, thus, that may not include any capture.

<doc id="572511" wikidata="Q622404" url="?curid=572511" title="Boyfriend">
<text>A boyfriend is a man who is a friend or acquaintance to the speaker, often specifying a regular male companion with whom a person is platonically, romantically or sexually involved. 

A boyfriend can also be called an admirer, beau, suitor and sweetheart. The analogous term for women is &quot;girlfriend&quot;.

==Scope==
Partners in committed non-marital relationships are also sometimes described as a &quot;significant other&quot; or &quot;partner&quot;, especially if the individuals are cohabiting.

A 2005 study of 115 people ages 21 to 35 who were either living with or had lived with a romantic partner notes that the lack of proper terms often leads to awkward situations, such as someone upset over not being introduced in social situations to avoid the question.

==Word history==
The word &quot;dating&quot; entered the American language during the Roaring Twenties. Prior to that, courtship was a matter of family and community interest. Starting around the time of the American Civil War, courtship became a private matter for couples. In the early to mid 19th century in the US, women were often visited by &quot;gentleman callers&quot;, single men who would arrive at the home of a young woman with the hopes of beginning a courtship. The era of the gentleman caller ended in the early 20th century and the modern idea of dating developed.

In literature, the term is discussed in July 1988 in Neil Bartlett&#x27;s &quot;Who Was That Man? A Present for Mr Oscar Wilde.&quot; On pages 108–110, Bartlett quotes from an issue of &quot;The Artist and Journal of Home Culture&quot;, which refers to Alectryon as &quot;a boyfriend of Mars&quot;.

==Synonyms==
*An older man may be referred to as a &quot;sugar daddy&quot;, a well-to-do man who financially supports or lavishly spends on a mistress, girlfriend, or boyfriend.
*In popular culture, slang, internet chat, and cellphone texting, the truncated acronym &quot;bf&quot; is also used.
*&quot;Leman&quot;, an archaic word for &quot;sweetheart, paramour,&quot; from Medieval British &quot;leofman&quot; (c.1205), from Old English &quot;leof&quot; (cognate of Dutch &quot;lief&quot;, German &quot;lieb&quot;) &quot;dear&quot; + &quot;man&quot; &quot;human being, person&quot; was originally applied to either gender, but usually means mistress.
* The term &quot;young man&quot; was at some periods used with a similar connotation. For example, in the 1945 film &quot;My Name Is Julia Ross&quot; the female protagonist, seeking a secretarial job, is asked if she has &quot;a young man&quot; – where in later films a similar question would have referred to &quot;a boyfriend&quot;.

<text>William Bradley Kincaid (July 13, 1895 – September 23, 1989) was an American folk singer and radio entertainer.

== Biography ==
He was born in Point Leavell, Garrard County, Kentucky, but built a music career in the northern states. His debut radio performance came in 1926 on the National Barn Dance show on WLS-AM in Chicago, Illinois. A prolific composer of folk and country music tunes, the first edition of his 1928 songbook called &quot;My Favorite Mountain Ballads&quot; sold more than 100,000 copies; later editions brought the total to 400,000. He recorded on Gennett Records.

In 1935 he was working at WBZ-AM in Boston, Massachusetts, where he performed with a band that included young singer and banjo player Marshall Jones. Kincaid teased the 22-year-old fellow Kentuckian for always being grumpy when he came to the studio to do the early morning broadcast, nicknaming him &quot;Grandpa&quot; Jones. The moniker became permanent for the future Grand Ole Opry star.

Kincaid moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1945 where he too became a member of the Grand Ole Opry.

In 1971, he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

In 1988, the then 93-year-old Kincaid was involved in an automobile accident and sustained injuries from which he never fully recovered. He died in 1989 at the age of 94 in Springfield, Ohio and was interred there in the Ferncliff Cemetery.

Old Homestead Records released several volumes of Kincaid&#x27;s mountain ballads, hymns, and old-time songs.

<doc id="572518" wikidata="Q125422609" url="?curid=572518" title="Vicuña">
<text>The vicuña (Lama vicugna) or vicuna (both , very rarely spelled &quot;vicugna&quot;, its former genus name) is one of the two wild South American camelids, which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes; the other camelid is the guanaco, which lives at lower elevations. Vicuñas are relatives of the llama, and are now believed to be the wild ancestor of domesticated alpacas, which are raised for their coats. Vicuñas produce small amounts of extremely fine wool, which is very expensive because the animal can only be shorn every three years and has to be caught from the wild. When knitted together, the product of the vicuña&#x27;s wool is very soft and warm. The Inca valued vicuñas highly for their wool, and it was against the law for anyone but royalty to wear vicuña garments; today, the vicuña is the national animal of Peru and appears on the Peruvian coat of arms.

Both under the rule of the Inca and today, vicuñas have been protected by law, but they were heavily hunted in the intervening period. When they were declared endangered in 1974, only about 6,000 animals were left. Today, the vicuña population has recovered to about 350,000, and although conservation organizations have reduced its level of threat classification, they still call for active conservation programs to protect populations from poaching, habitat loss, and other threats.

Previously, the vicuña was not considered domesticated, and the llama and the alpaca were regarded as descendants of the closely related guanaco. However, DNA research published in 2001 has demonstrated that the alpaca may have vicuña parentage. Today, the vicuña is mainly wild, but the local people still perform special rituals with these creatures, including a fertility rite.

==Description==
The vicuña is considered more delicate and gracile than the guanaco and smaller. A key distinguishing element of morphology is the better-developed incisor roots for the guanaco. The vicuña&#x27;s long, woolly coat is tawny brown on the back, whereas the hair on the throat and chest is white and quite long. Its head is slightly shorter than guanaco&#x27;s, and the ears are slightly longer. The length of the head and body ranges from 1.45 to 1.60 m (about 5 ft); shoulder height is from 75 to 85 cm (around 3 ft); its weight is from 35 to 65 kg (under 150 lb). It falls prey to the cougar and culpeo.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
There are two subspecies of vicuña:
* &quot;Lama vicugna vicugna&quot;
* &quot;Lama vicugna mensalis&quot;

While vicuñas are restricted to the more extreme elevations of the Andes in modern times, they may have also been present in the lowland regions of Patagonia as much as 3500 km south of their current range during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. Fossils of these lowland camelids have been assigned to a species known as &quot;Lama gracilis&quot;, but genetic and morphological analysis between them and modern vicuña indicate the two may be the same.

==Distribution and habitat==
Vicuñas are native to South America&#x27;s central Andes. They are found in Peru, northwestern Argentina, Bolivia, and northern Chile. A smaller, introduced population lives in central Ecuador. 

Vicuñas live at altitudes of . They feed in the daytime on the grassy plains of the Andes Mountains but spend the nights on the slopes. In these areas, only nutrient-poor, tough, bunch grasses and &quot;Festuca&quot; grow. The sun&#x27;s rays can penetrate the thin atmosphere, producing relatively warm temperatures during the day; however, the temperatures drop to freezing at night. The vicuña&#x27;s thick but soft coat is a unique adaptation that traps layers of warm air close to its body to tolerate freezing temperatures.

Chief predators include pumas and the culpeo.

==Behavior==
The behavior of vicuñas is similar to that of the guanacos. They are timid animals and are easily aroused by intruders due, among other things, to their extraordinary hearing. Like the guanacos, they frequently lick calcareous stones and rocks, which, together with salt water, is its source of salt. Vicuñas are clean animals and always deposit their excrement in the same place. Their diets consist mainly of low grasses which grow in clumps on the ground.

Vicuñas live in family-based groups of a male, 5 to 15 females, and their young. Each group has its territory of about , which can fluctuate depending on food availability.

Mating usually occurs in March–April. After a gestation about 11 months, the female gives birth to a single fawn, which is nursed for about ten months. The fawn becomes independent at about 12 to 18 months old. Young males form bachelor groups, and the young females search for a sorority to join. This deters intraspecific competition and inbreeding.

==Conservation==

Until 1964, hunting of the vicuña was unrestricted, which reduced its numbers to only 6,000 in the 1960s. As a result, the species was declared endangered in 1974, and its status prohibited the trade of vicuña wool. In Peru, during 1964–1966, the Servicio Forestal y de Caza in cooperation with the US Peace Corps, Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and the National Agrarian University of La Molina established a nature conservatory for the vicuña called the Pampa Galeras – Barbara D&#x27;Achille in Lucanas Province, Ayacucho. During that time, a game warden academy was held in Nazca, where eight men from Peru and six from Bolivia were trained to protect the vicuña from poaching.

To cooperate on the conservation of the vicuña, the governments of Bolivia and Peru signed the Convention for the Conservation of the Vicuña on 16 August 1969 in La Paz, explicitly leaving the treaty open to accession by Argentina and Chile. Ecuador acceded on 11 February 1976. The Convention prohibited their international trade and domestic exploitation, and ordered the parties to create reserves and breeding centres. A follow-up treaty, the Convention for the Conservation and Management of the Vicuña, was signed between Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru on 20 December 1979 in Lima. It explicitly allowed only Argentina to sign it if it also signed the 1969 La Paz Convention (Article 12; Argentina joined in 1981), and did not allow other countries to accede to the convention &#x27;due to its specific character&#x27; (Article 13). The 1979 Convention did allow the use of the vicuña under strict circumstances if the animal population had recovered sufficiently. In combination with CITES (effective in 1975), as well as USA and EU trade legislation, the Conventions were highly successful, as the vicuña population substantially grew as a result.

The estimated population in Peru was 66,559 in 1994, 103,161 in 1997, 118,678 in 2000, and 208,899 in 2012. Currently, the community of Lucanas conducts a &quot;chaccu&quot; (herding, capturing, and shearing) on the reserve each year to harvest the wool, organized by the National Council for South American Camelids (CONACS).

In Bolivia, the Ulla Ulla National Reserve was founded 1977 partly as a sanctuary for the species. Their numbers grew to 125,000 in Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Since this was a ready &quot;cash crop&quot; for community members, the countries relaxed regulations on vicuña wool in 1993, enabling its trade once again. The wool is sold on the world market for over $300 per kg. In 2002, the US Fish and Wildlife Service reclassified most populations as threatened, but still lists Ecuador&#x27;s population as endangered. While the population levels have recovered to a healthy level, poaching remains a constant threat, as do habitat loss and other threats. Consequently, the IUCN still supports active conservation programs to protect vicuñas, though they lowered their status to least concern in 2018.

In 2015, French luxury group LVMH said that &quot;Loro Piana saved the species.&quot; The Italian company has been criticized for underpaying local communities collecting the wool. In 2022, the Argentine government&#x27;s National Council for Scientific and Technical Investigation estimated that &quot;Andean communities receive around 3% of the value generated by the vicuña fiber chain.&quot;

==Vicuña wool==
Its wool is famous for its warmth and is used for apparel, such as socks, sweaters, accessories, shawls, coats, suits, and home furnishings, such as blankets and throws. Its properties come from the tiny scales on the hollow, air-filled fibres, which causes them to interlock and trap insulating air. Vicuñas have some of the finest fibers in the world, at a diameter of 12 μm. The fiber of cashmere goats is 14 to 19 μm, while angora rabbit is 8 to 12 μm, and that of shahtoosh from the Tibetan antelope, or chiru, is from 9 to 12 μm.

<text>12 Hits from Hell: The MSP Sessions is a cancelled studio album by American horror punk band the Misfits. It was recorded in 1980 but went unreleased. Caroline Records attempted to release it in 2001, but band members Glenn Danzig and Jerry Only called off production and the album was scrapped.

== Background ==
In August 7, 1980, the Misfits recorded twelve songs at Master Sound Productions studios with the intention of releasing a full-length album. The band&#x27;s lineup at this time included singer Glenn Danzig, guitarist Bobby Steele, bassist Jerry Only, and drummer Arthur Googy. During the sessions, Only was grooming his younger brother Doyle to join the band, and Doyle recorded his own guitar tracks and overdubs separately in addition to Steele&#x27;s. The tracks were mixed in September, but in October, Steele was ejected from the band in favor of Doyle and the planned album was scrapped. Five of the songs were released in 1981, with &quot;London Dungeon&quot;, &quot;Horror Hotel&quot; and &quot;Ghouls Night Out&quot; being released as &quot;3 Hits from Hell&quot; while the &quot;Halloween&quot; single included both &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Halloween II&quot;. The band used the remainder of the recordings as demos for their 1982 album &quot;Walk Among Us&quot;.

The Misfits broke up in 1983, but after a series of legal battles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits, sharing merchandising rights with Danzig, who holds writing credits on all of the Misfits material written between 1977 and 1983. Only and Doyle formed a new incarnation of the band and released two albums during the 1990s. During the intervening years, several of the tracks from the August 1980 sessions were released in various mixes on compilation albums: &quot;Halloween&quot; appeared on &quot;Legacy of Brutality&quot; (1985), &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;Vampira&quot;, &quot;Skulls&quot; and &quot;Astro Zombies&quot; appeared on &quot;Misfits&quot; (1986), and &quot;Horror Hotel&quot; appeared on &quot;Collection II&quot; (1995). The Misfits box set (1996) contained the most complete collection of songs from these sessions, collecting the complete &quot;Legacy of Brutality&quot;, &quot;Misfits&quot;, and &quot;Collection II&quot; albums as well as a disc of unreleased studio recordings with the original mixes of &quot;I Turned into a Martian&quot;, &quot;Skulls&quot;, &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;Astro Zombies&quot;, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, &quot;Violent World&quot; and &quot;Halloween II&quot; from the 1980 sessions.

In 2001, Caroline Records announced that they would be releasing the complete 1980 sessions on October 30 under the title &quot;12 Hits from Hell&quot;, including an alternate take of &quot;London Dungeon&quot;, and sent promotional copies of the album to the band members. However, production was called off after Glenn Danzig and Jerry Only expressed concerns with the album&#x27;s layout, packaging, liner notes, mixing and mastering. All distribution copies of the album were destroyed and only the promotional copies remain. As a result, some copies still managed to reach critics.

On Halloween 2007, Bobby Steele posted his own versions of the &quot;12 Hits from Hell&quot; songs, recorded with his band the Undead, as streaming audio through the band&#x27;s website.

== Reception ==
Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic gave &quot;12 Hits from Hell&quot; three stars out of five, saying &quot;This isn&#x27;t an essential item and will probably appeal mostly to the legions of Misfits fanatics, who will no doubt savor these long-unreleased recordings. Many of these songs are available elsewhere.&quot;

== Track listing ==

== Personnel ==
*Glenn Danzig – vocals
*Jerry Only – bass guitar
*Bobby Steele – guitar
*Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein – additional guitar and overdubs
*Arthur Googy – drums
*Robbie Alter – additional guitar on &quot;London Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Violent World&quot;

<text>The New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University (CALS or Ag School) is one of Cornell University&#x27;s four statutory colleges, and is the only agricultural college in the Ivy League. With enrollment of approximately 3,390 undergraduate and 1,100 graduate students, CALS is Cornell&#x27;s second-largest undergraduate college and the third-largest college of its kind in the United States.

Though part of Cornell, a private Ivy League university, CALS receives funding through The State University of New York to administer New York&#x27;s cooperative extension program alongside the College of Human Ecology as an essential component of Cornell University&#x27;s land-grant mission. CALS runs the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York, as well as other facilities across New York State.

In 2007–08, CALS total budget (excluding the Geneva Station) is $283 million, with $96 million coming from tuition and $52 million coming from state appropriations. The Geneva Station budget was an additional $25 million.

==Academic programs==
CALS offers more than 20 majors, each with a focus on Life Sciences, Applied Social Sciences, Environmental Sciences and Agriculture and Food. CALS undergraduate programs lead to a Bachelor of Science degree in one of 23 different majors. CALS also offers graduate degrees in various fields of study, including the M.A.T., M.L.A., M.P.S., M.S., and PhD

==Rankings and admission==
Cornell&#x27;s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences is the most renowned institution in its field. In 2019, it is ranked 1st in the &quot;Food and Nutrition&quot; and &quot;Agricultural Sciences&quot; sectors of Niche.com

With an admission rate of 11.5% for the fall of 2018, admission into the college is extremely competitive and in the middle relative to the other colleges at Cornell.

==Additional programs and facilities==

===The Agriculture Quadrangle===
The Agriculture Quadrangle (Ag Quad) is a grouping of buildings dedicated to programs offered by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. The oldest building on the quad is Caldwell Hall (1913). The Plant Science Building (1931), and Warren Hall (1931), flank the art deco style Albert R. Mann Library (1952). A newer Kennedy and Roberts Halls replaced the original 1906 building, and The Computing and Communications Center (1912) was formerly Comstock Hall). These buildings are owned by New York State, which pays for their construction and maintenance.

The college operates extension programs through the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station (NYSAES) in Geneva, New York, in 20 buildings, including the Barton Laboratory Greenhouse and Sutton Road Solar Farm (a 2-megawatt energy facility that offsets nearly 40 percent of NYSAES annual electricity demands), on 130 acres (0.5 km) and over 700 acres (2.8 km) of test plots and other land parcels used to conduct horticultural research and also substations: the Vineyard Research Laboratory in Fredonia, Hudson Valley Laboratory in Highland, and Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory in Riverhead.

The Dilmun Hill Student Farm is located in Ithaca, New York is a student-run farm facility operated according to sustainable agricultural practices.

The Social Media Lab, is part of the college&#x27;s communications department. In this modern research laboratory, faculty supervise undergraduate and graduate research focusing on human interaction in CMC and online communities, including the investigation of social phenomena, such as disclosure or deception among users of social media computer applications, such as Facebook, Grindr. Studies examine human behavior, personal experience, and human interaction in the digital realm along the dimensions of language processes, perception, self-representation, and interpersonal interaction. In 2009, The Social Media Lab coined the term, the Butler Lie, a reference to factually untrue verbal communication used to politely initiate or end an instant message conversation, such as &quot;Gotta go, boss is coming!&quot; These statements buffer the otherwise negative experience of social rejection or ostracism.

The recently established Rich&#x27;s Food Safety Lab was made possible by a donation from frozen food industry giant Rich Products. The laboratory aims to engages in critical food safety research and the education of the next generation of food safety leaders.
==History==
Cornell&#x27;s first president, Andrew Dickson White, had little enthusiasm for agricultural education, and the Board of Trustees were likewise without much enthusiasm. Agriculture could not be ignored, however, because Ezra Cornell was deeply committed, and the provisions of the Morrill Land Grant Act required it. After much difficulty, George Chapman Caldwell was recruited in 1867 as Professor of Chemistry (Agricultural Chemistry). He was the very first professor of what was to become the Cornell University.

The university opened in September 1868 with professor Caldwell, the nominal leader of a group of three professors with interests touching upon agriculture. In addition to Caldwell, there was Albert N. Prentiss, professor of botany (with some reference to crops), and Dr. James Law, professor of veterinary medicine. The Faculty of Agriculture consisted of this informal group of three and a professor of agriculture of the moment.

The arrival of Isaac P. Roberts, as professor of agriculture, from Iowa Agricultural College, in 1874, finally brought credibility to agriculture at Cornell. During the period of 1879–1887, Cornell president Charles Kendall Adams gradually changed the Trustees seemingly hostility toward agriculture. In June 1888, the &quot;informal&quot; departments, including agriculture taught by Isaac Roberts, agricultural chemistry taught by George Caldwell, botany taught by Albert Prentiss, entomology taught by Henry Comstock, and veterinary medicine taught by James Law, were combined to form the Cornell College of Agriculture.

Established in 1874 as the Department of Agriculture, the department became a college in 1888. Also in June 1888, horticulture, which had played a minor role in botany until it was discontinued by the trustees in 1880, was reestablished as an independent department in the college, upon the recruitment of Liberty Hyde Bailey as professor and department head. Roberts was appointed Director of the college and dean of its faculty while retaining his role as professor of agriculture and heading a department of agriculture within the college of the same name.

===Establishment of the New York State College of Agriculture===
In 1904, eminent botanist and horticulturist Liberty Hyde Bailey, along with New York State farmers, convinced the New York Legislature to financially support the agriculture college. Legislation establishing the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell passed the state legislature and was signed by the governor in May 1904. The legislation passed in spite of ″violent″ opposition and intense lobbying led by Chancellor James Roscoe Day of Syracuse University acting for Syracuse and six other universities and colleges in New York.

The college made discoveries and disseminated results from other schools, especially regarding insect control, fertilizers, breeding, veterinary medicine, cultivation, and farm management.
The legislation provided $125,000 for the construction of a new building for the college. The building was constructed in three parts to comply with the act&#x27;s restriction on spending for a single building. These were Stone Hall, Roberts Hall, and East Roberts Hall. Named for dean Isaac P. Roberts, the buildings were built in 1905-1906 along Tower Road. East Roberts served as the new Dairy Building, as the old Dairy Building was merged into Goldwin Smith Hall. The three buildings were determined in 1973 to be decrepit, and despite being listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1984, Cornell had them demolished in 1988. Kennedy-Roberts Hall was built in 1989 to replace Roberts-Stone Halls.

The college changed its name from the New York State College of Agriculture to the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 1971.

===Absorbing the College of Forestry===
In 1898, the State Legislature established a separate New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. However, the school ran into political controversy, and the Governor vetoed its annual appropriation in 1903. In 1910, Liberty Hyde Bailey, the Dean of Cornell&#x27;s Agriculture College, succeeded in having what remained of the Forestry College transferred to his school. At his request, in 1911, the legislature appropriated $100,000 to construct a building to house the new Forestry Department on the Cornell campus, which Cornell later named Fernow Hall. That Forestry Department continues today as the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment. In 1927, Cornell established a 1,639-acre (6.63 km2) research forest south of Ithaca, the Arnot Woods.

===Home economics===
In 1900, the college began offering a reading course for farm women. In 1907, the Department of Home Economics was created within college. In 1919, the Department of Home Economics became a school within the Agriculture College. Finally, in 1925, the Home Economics department became a separate college, although both colleges continued to work together to provide cooperative extension services.

<text>There have been two baronetcies created for members of the Guinness brewing family, both in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. As of 2014 both titles are extant.

The Guinness Baronetcy, of Ashford in the County of Galway, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 15 April 1867 for the brewer, philanthropist and conservative member of parliament Benjamin Guinness. He was a grandson of Arthur Guinness, the founder of the Guinness brewery. His son, the second baronet, was also a businessman and conservative politician and contributed to numerous charitable causes. On 1 May 1880 he was created Baron Ardilaun, of Ashford in the County of Galway, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. 

Lord Ardilaun was childless and the barony became extinct on his death in 1915. However, he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his nephew Sir Algernon, the third baronet, the son of Benjamin Lee Guinness, second son of the first baronet. the title is held by the third baronet&#x27;s great-nephew, the fifth baronet, who succeeded his father in 2011. He is the grandson of the racing driver Kenelm Lee Guinness, grandson of the first baronet.

The family seat was Ashford Castle, near Cong, County Galway.

The Guinness Baronetcy, of Castleknock in the County Dublin, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 27 May 1885 for Edward Guinness. He was the third son of the first baronet of the 1867 creation. Guinness was later elevated to the peerage as Earl of Iveagh. For more information, see this title. Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne was the third son of the first Earl of Iveagh.

==Guinness baronets, of Ashford (1867)==

*Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness, 1st Baronet (1798–1868)
*Sir Arthur Edward Guinness, 2nd Baronet (1840–1915) (created Baron Ardilaun in 1880)
*Sir Algernon Arthur St Lawrence Lee Guinness, 3rd Baronet (1883–1954)
*Sir Kenelm Ernest Lee Guinness, 4th Baronet (1928–2011)

<text>Ernest Duchesne (30 May 1874 – 12 April 1912) was a French physician who noted that certain molds kill bacteria. He made this discovery 32 years before Alexander Fleming discovered the antibiotic properties of penicillin, a substance derived from those molds, but his research went unnoticed.

==Life and work==
Duchesne entered &quot;l&#x27;Ecole du Service de Santé Militaire de Lyon&quot; (the Military Health Service School of Lyons) in 1894. Duchesne&#x27;s thesis, &quot;Contribution à l’étude de la concurrence vitale chez les micro-organismes: antagonisme entre les moisissures et les microbes&quot; (Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between molds and microbes), that he submitted in 1897 to get his doctorate degree, was the first study to consider the therapeutic capabilities of molds resulting from their anti-microbial activity.

In his landmark thesis, Duchesne proposed that bacteria and molds engage in a perpetual battle for survival. In one experiment, he treated cultures of &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot; with media containing either bacteria that cause typhoid fever (&quot;Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica&quot;, formerly: &quot;Bacillus typhosus&quot; (Eberth)) or &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (formerly: &quot;Bacterium coli communis&quot;) ; the &quot;Penicillium&quot; succumbed to the bacteria. Nevertheless, he wondered whether the &quot;Penicillium&quot; might have weakened the bacteria before the mold perished. So he injected guinea pigs with media containing bacteria (either typhoid or &quot;E. coli&quot;) and media containing &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot;. The animals survived and were rendered immune to the bacteria. He speculated that molds might release toxins, as some bacteria do. To treat diseases, he proposed using media in which either bacteria or molds had been cultured. Duchesne concluded that:

While only weakly conclusive given the number of the experimental trials, this proves Duchesne understood, concluded, and published information about the effect of the &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot; mold as a therapeutic agent in animals. Because he was 23 and unknown, the Institut Pasteur did not even acknowledge receipt of his dissertation.

Duchesne served a one-year internship at Val-de-Grâce before he was appointed a 2nd class Major of Medicine in the 2nd Regiment de Hussards de Senlis. In 1901, he married Rosa Lassalas from Cannes. She died 2 years later of tuberculosis. In 1904, Duchesne also contracted a serious chest disease, probably tuberculosis. Three years later, he was discharged from the army and sent to a sanatorium in Amélie-les-Bains. He died on 12 April 1912, at age 37. Duchesne is buried next to his wife in the Cimetière du Grand Jas in Cannes.

==Recognition==
Duchesne was posthumously honored in 1949, 5 years after Alexander Fleming had received the Nobel Prize.

&quot;A history of antibiotics&quot; contains a suggestion on why it was forgotten:
:While Fleming generally receives credit for discovering penicillin, in fact, technically, Fleming rediscovered the substance. In 1896, the French medical student Ernest Duchesne originally discovered the antibiotic properties of &quot;Penicillium&quot; but failed to report a connection between the fungus and a substance that had antibacterial properties, and &quot;Penicillium&quot; was forgotten in the scientific community until Fleming&#x27;s rediscovery.

<doc id="572533" wikidata="Q4862111" url="?curid=572533" title="Baron Arklow">
<text>Baron Arklow was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom that has been created twice. Arklow is a town in County Wicklow in Ireland.

==History==
===First creation, 1801===
It was created first in 1801 as a substantive title by King George III for his son Prince Augustus Frederick. Augustus Frederick was also created Duke of Sussex and Earl of Inverness, on the same day. The title became extinct upon Prince Augustus Frederick&#x27;s death in 1843.

Although Prince Augustus Frederick was survived by a son and daughter by Lady Augusta Murray, their marriage (purportedly solemnized at St George&#x27;s Hanover Square Church, Westminster, in 1793) had been annulled for lack of royal permission under the Royal Marriages Act 1772, rendering the children illegitimate under English law and unable to inherit titles from their father. Both children by the annulled marriage died childless, rendering the issue of their inheritance moot.

On 2 May 1831, Prince Augustus Frederick married secondly (and again in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772), Lady Cecilia Gore at Great Cumberland Place, London. Not being the Prince&#x27;s legitimate wife, Lady Cecilia could not be received at court. On 30 March 1840, she was given the title of Duchess of Inverness in her own right by Queen Victoria.

===Second creation, 1881===
The second creation in 1881, as a substantive title by Queen Victoria for her son Prince Leopold. Leopold was also created Duke of Albany and Earl of Clarence, on the same day. Prince Leopold&#x27;s son, Prince Charles Edward (who had succeeded as reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1900), was deprived of the peerage in 1919 for bearing arms against the United Kingdom in World War I.

<text>Chasseur ( , ), a French term for &quot;hunter&quot;, is the designation given to certain regiments of French and Belgian light infantry () or light cavalry () to denote troops trained for rapid action.

==History==
This branch of the French Army originated during the War of the Austrian Succession when, in 1743, Jean Chrétien Fischer was authorized by the Marshal de Belle-Isle to raise a 600 strong mixed force of infantry and cavalry. It was called &quot;Chasseurs de Fischer.&quot; During the remainder of the 18th century various types of light troops () were employed within the French army, either as independent units or as companies within existing regiments. In 1788, there were 8 battalions of chasseurs, and in March 1793 this was expanded to 21 battalions. The first battalions of Chasseurs raised by 1788 included:

* (1st) &quot;Chasseurs Royaux de Provence&quot;
* (2nd) &quot;Chasseurs Royaux de Dauphiné&quot;
* (3rd) &quot;Chasseurs Royaux Corses&quot; (Corsican)
* (4th) &quot;Chasseurs Corses&quot; (Corsican)
* (5th) &quot;Chasseurs Cantabres&quot; (Cantabrian)
* (6th) &quot;Chasseurs Bretons&quot;
* (7th) &quot;Chasseurs d&#x27;Auvergne&quot;
* (8th) &quot;Chasseurs des Vosges&quot;
* (9th) &quot;Chasseurs des Cévennes&quot;
* (10th) &quot;Chasseurs du Gèvaudan&quot;
* (11th) &quot;Chasseurs des Ardennes&quot;
* (12th) &quot;Chasseurs du Roussillon&quot;
The were the light infantrymen of the French Imperial army. They were armed the same as their counterparts in the regular line infantry (fusilier) battalions, but were trained to excel in marksmanship and in executing manoeuvres at high speed. From 1840, they wore a long-skirted frock coat. After 1850, however the chasseurs adopted a uniform consisting of a short frock coat with slits in the sides on the bottom edge to allow for better freedom of movement than the previous design. They also wore light blue baggy trousers (in contrast to the red of the line infantry)
tucked into jambières (leather gaiters). The other light infantry unit type, the voltigeurs, specialised as skirmishers and for advance screening of the main force. The chasseurs could also be called upon to form advance guards and scouting parties alongside the voltigeurs.

Following the Napoleonic Wars the continued to exist as a separate corps within the infantry. Initially a specially trained elite, their tactical role eventually came to match that of the ordinary (line infantry). By the late 19th century the differences between the two branches were confined to uniform and insignia, although the chasseurs retained a strong esprit de corps. Immediately after the Franco-Prussian War it was argued that the continued existence of a nominally elite class of infantry that was in fact armed and trained to the same standards as the ordinary soldier, was contrary to both military utility and the egalitarian principles of the new republic. However public opinion, influenced by the occasions on which the chasseurs had distinguished themselves during the war was opposed to the disbanding of this distinctive corps. Under the Third Republic the were increased from 20 to 30 battalions. Of these, 4 saw active service in Tunisia, one in Indochina and one in Madagascar during the period 1880-1896. Twelve of the chasseur battalions were re-designated as mountain infantry (). The remaining chasseur battalions were deployed near the frontier with Germany as part of the , charged with covering the bulk of the army during mobilization.

During World War I the French Army maintained 31 battalions of infantry chasseurs plus a varying number of reserve and territorial units. Each infantry division was expected to include at least one battalion of either or Each battalion had an establishment of 1,300 to 1,500 men. They were reportedly nicknamed (black devils) by their German opponents, in reference to their dark colored uniforms. The chasseurs served mainly on the Western Front but detachments were sent to reinforce the Italian front in 1917.

===Chasseurs à cheval===
The , a type of French light cavalry, date from 1743 when an independent unit (Fischer&#x27;s Volunteer Company of Chasseurs) was raised during the War of the Austrian Succession to counter Trenck&#x27;s Pandurs and Croats employed as irregulars by the Austrian army. Originally a mixed corps of light infantry and horsemen, this force proved sufficiently effective to warrant the creation of a single corps: In 1776 this and other volunteer &quot;legions&quot; had their mounted elements converted into 24 squadrons of each of which was attached to one of the existing dragoon regiments of the royal cavalry. In 1779 these squadrons were amalgamated into six regiments, each of which was given a regional title (1st 2nd etc.). In 1788, 6 dragoon regiments were converted to and during the period of the Revolutionary Wars the number was again increased, to 25.

During their earlier history these regiments lacked the higher profile of the identically-armed (but much more lavishly uniformed) hussars. Distinguished by dark green uniforms and a bugle-horn badge, they were frequently used as advance scouting units providing valuable information on enemy movements. Both Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard and the Royal Guard of the Restoration each included a regiment of . In addition Napoleon added a further 5 line regiments to those inherited from the Revolutionary period. At the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the French Army had 12 regiments of , grouped with 8 hussar regiments to form the light branch of the cavalry and tasked with primarily reconnaissance duties. This intended role continued through World War I and the remained entirely horse mounted until the was motorised in June 1940. Disbanded after the Battle of France, these units were reconstituted in 1944–45 as light armor.

During the French occupation of Algeria, regiments of were raised. These were light cavalry recruited originally from French volunteers and subsequently from the French settlers in North Africa doing their military service. As such they were the mounted equivalent of the zouaves.

===Flanqueurs Chasseurs===
In preparation for the invasion of Russia, Napoleon ordered the creation of additional units for the Guard that included the &quot;Régiment de Flanqueurs-Chasseurs de la Garde&quot;. Along with the regiment of &quot;Flanqueues-Grenadiers&quot;, this was mainly recruited from the sons and nephews of forest service civil servants or made up of young men who wanted to obtain a position within the Waters and Forests Administration after concluding their military service.

The role of these light infantry soldiers was to flank the main army while on the march, in order to guard against any sudden attack.

===Chasseurs Forestiers===
The (forest huntsmen) were militarized units of the &quot;Eaux et Forêts administration&quot; (Waters and Forests Administration). They were organized in 18 companies and many sections. The existed between 1875 and 1924. The &quot;chasseurs forestiers&quot; were classed as light infantry troops and could form advance guards and scouting parties due to their knowledge of natural fields and their ability to make or read maps. 

Established by a decree of the newly established Third Republic dated 2 April 1875, the &quot;Chasseurs Forestiers&quot; incorporated some personnel of the existing Water and Forest Administration into the French Army on a part-time basis. The purpose was to make use of trained and specialist manpower as part of the armed forces in time of war. The specific roles envisaged for the &quot;Chasseurs Forestiers&quot; were to provide guides for the regular army and to work with the Engineers in obtaining stocks of timber for military use. 

While provided with distinctive green and grey uniforms plus stocks of standard infantry weapons and equipment, the &quot;Chasseurs Forestiers&quot; performed their normal forestry service functions in peacetime with only limited involvement in army training and manoeuvers. Upon mobilisation in August 1914 personnel aged between 25 and 48 years saw front line service in the Vosges in northern France. Post-war policy changes led to the disestablishment of the &quot;Chasseurs Forestiers&quot; as a military body in 1924.

==Modern French Army==
The modern French Army still maintains (mechanized infantry: 16e BC), (mountain troops: 7e, 13e, 27e BCA) and regiments of (1er-2e RCh and 4e RCh: light armored regiments). In addition one regiment of (training unit: 1er RCA) has been re-raised to commemorate this branch of the French cavalry. Since May 1943 there has been a &quot;Régiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes&quot; (1er RCP).

All of these units have different traditions:

* are light infantry units created after 1838. Some of these battalions were converted to specialized mountain units as in 1888, as an answer to the Italian Alpine () regiments stationed along the Alpine frontier.
* are units of the &quot;Arme Blindée Cavalerie&quot;: armoured units. The basic organic unit is called regiment and not bataillon to avoid confusing cavalry and infantry chasseurs.
* The airborne infantry units called &quot;Régiments de chasseurs parachutistes&quot; were created in 1943 with airborne troops from the French Airforce (GIA or ), who were transferred into the Army.
* are the elite mountain infantry of the modern French Army. They are trained to operate in mountainous terrain and to undertake urban warfare.

Although the traditions of these different branches of the French Army are very different, there is still a tendency to confuse one with the other. For example, when World War I veteran Léon Weil died, the AFP press agency stated that he was a member of the 5th &quot;Régiment de Chasseurs Alpins&quot;. It was in fact the 5th Bataillon.

==Belgian army==
From its creation as a permanent force in 1832 the Belgian army included regiments of both chasseurs à pied and chasseurs à cheval, performing the same roles as their French counterparts. Their lineage is a continuation of regiments of hussars and light-dragoons of the army of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands from which they were originated. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 there were 3 regiments of Chasseurs à pied, each of 3 battalions, and 3 regiments of mounted Chasseurs.

In 1933 a new regiment of light infantry: the Chasseurs Ardennais, was created to garrison the mountainous region of that name.

In 2011, the 1st Regiment of Chasseurs à cheval/Guides (result of the fusion of the 1st Chasseurs à Cheval and the Regiment of Guides in 2004) was amalgamated with the 2nd/4th Regiment of Chasseurs à cheval, in order to form the Battalion Chasseurs à Cheval (Bataljon Jagers te Paard). The battalion is dedicated to the ISTAR missions and carries the standard of the 1st Chasseurs à Cheval.

==U.S. Army==
The U.S. Federal Army adopted Chasseurs during the Civil War as a scouting and skirmishing force for use against the Confederate Army. Their uniform was patterned after the French style, with the short, vented coat, though they were issued grey kepis. A notable unit of Civil War Chasseurs were the 65th New York Volunteer Infantry (also known as the 1st United States Chasseurs). The Chasseurs were involved in the Peninsula campaign, as well as the Appomattox campaign, and lost a total of 146 men. They were distinct for choosing to wear M1858 uniform hats (more popularly known as Hardee hats) rather than the kepis.

The 14th Brooklyn, one of the most famous regiments of the Civil War, wore a Chasseur uniform their whole term.

In 1862, following the capture of Confederate-held New Orleans by Federal soldiers, an all-black regiment named the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique was raised.

==Argentinian Army==
In the Argentinian Army, the term (Spanish for hunter, although in a military context it means chasseur or ranger) is used to designate certain special units trained to operate in specific geographical areas, such as mountain or jungle. Currently, there are two independent companies of (mountain rangers) and three of (jungle rangers).

<doc id="572550" wikidata="Q4644903" url="?curid=572550" title="867-5309/Jenny">
<text>&quot;867-5309/Jenny&quot; is a song written by Alex Call and Jim Keller and performed by Keller&#x27;s band Tommy Tutone. It was released on the album &quot;Tommy Tutone 2&quot; (1981) through Columbia Records. It peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number one on the Rock Top Tracks chart in April 1982. The song led to a fad of people prank calling unsuspecting victims by dialing 867-5309 and asking for &quot;Jenny&quot;.

==Creation==
According to lead guitarist Jim Keller, interviewed by &quot;People&quot; in 1982: &quot;Jenny is a regular girl, not a hooker. Friends of mine wrote her name and number on a men&#x27;s room wall at a bar. I called her on a dare, and we dated for a while. I haven&#x27;t talked with her since the song became a hit, but I hear she thinks I&#x27;m a real jerk for writing it.&quot;

The band&#x27;s lead singer Tommy Heath had a different version of the song&#x27;s origin, but also with a real girl and number. He claims the number belonged to a girl he knew, and that he wrote it on a bathroom wall in a motel where they were staying, as a joke. &quot;We laughed about it for years,&quot; he said.

However, co-writer Alex Call explained his version of the song&#x27;s origins in a June 2004 interview with &quot;Songfacts&quot;:
&quot;There was no Jenny,&quot; Call also told a Tampa, Florida, columnist in June 2009. &quot;The number? It came to me out of the ether.&quot;

In the music video, the &quot;Jenny&quot; character is played by Karen Elaine Morton.

==Popularity and litigation==
The song, released in late 1981, initially gained popularity on the American West Coast in January 1982; many who had the number soon abandoned it because of unwanted calls.

Asking telephone companies to trace the calls was of no use, as Charles and Maurine Shambarger (then in West Akron, Ohio, at +1-216-867-5309) learned when Ohio Bell explained: &quot;We don’t know what to make of this. The calls are coming from all over the place.&quot; A little over a month later, they disconnected the number and the phone became silent.

In some cases, the number was picked up by commercial businesses or acquired for use in radio promotions.
* In 1982, WLS radio obtained the number from a Chicago woman, receiving 22,000 calls in four days.
* In 1982, Southwest Junior High School received up to two hundred calls daily asking for Jenny in area code 704.
* Brown University obtained the +1-401-867 prefix in 1999, assigning 867-5309 to a student dormitory room that was promptly inundated with nuisance calls. The number was subsequently assigned to a plumbing company, which registered it as a trademark.
* A February 2004 auction for the number in a New York City code was shut down by eBay after objections from Verizon; bidding had reached $80,000. The US Federal Communications Commission takes the position that most phone numbers are &quot;public resources&quot; that &quot;are not owned by carriers or their customers&quot; but did not rule out the number being sold as part of a business.
* A subsequent February 2004 auction for the number in area code 800 and 888 listed Jeffrey Steinberg&#x27;s Philadelphia business JSS Marketing for sale, including both numbers as part of the bundle. This circumvents eBay restrictions, which prevent selling the numbers on their own.
* In 2004, Weehawken, New Jersey, resident Spencer Potter picked up the number for free after discovering to his surprise that it was available in the 201 area code, hoping it would improve his DJ business. Unable to handle the overwhelming volume of calls, he sought to sell the number on eBay in February 2009. Although bids reached $1 million, his inability to confirm the identity of the bidders led him to sell it privately to Retro Fitness, a gym franchise with a location in Secaucus, New Jersey, that felt the 1980s origin of the number tied in with their business&#x27;s retro theme.
* In 2006, Benjamin Franklin Franchising, a large national plumbing franchise, began using a toll-free version of the number (+1-866-867-5309), which it advertised as &quot;867-5309/Benny&quot;. In 2007, Gem Plumbing &amp; Heating brought suit against Clockwork Home Services, the parent company of Benjamin Franklin Franchising, alleging a violation of its trademark. Clockwork contended that Gem&#x27;s trademark was invalid. Effective in May 2007, Clockwork was ordered by a court to stop using the number in New England. According to Tommy Heath, lead singer of Tommy Tutone: &quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous. If I wanted to get into it, I could probably take the number away from both of them.&quot;
* In 2009, nutrition firm Natrient LLC leased +1-800-867-5309 from 5309 Partners Ltd for $25 million as part of a radio ad campaign.
* In July 2009, Jason Kaplan had +1-267-867-5309 assigned to a Vonage phone line in the name of a small business and then listed the entire business for sale on eBay. The auction closed at $5,500.
* In January 2013, Five309 LLC announced plans to use 855-867-5309 and 888-867-5309 to promote the website JennySearch.com.
* In 2013, Florida realtor Carrie Routt was still receiving fifty prank calls daily at +1-850-867-5309.
* A Fort Collins, Colorado, restaurant, Totally 80&#x27;s Pizza, uses +1-970-867-5309 as part of its 1980s theme.

===Springsteen controversy===
Singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s 2007 single &quot;Radio Nowhere&quot; features a set of guitar riffs at the beginning that many fans considered particularly similar to &quot;867-5309/Jenny&quot;, although the lyrics and the tone of the two songs are quite different. Regarding legal action, Heath said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s close enough that if I wanted to, I could work with it... I don&#x27;t really get into that sort of thing, but the kids do need braces, so maybe I will.&quot; He later clarified that he had no interest in suing and felt &quot;really honored at a similarity, if any&quot;.

<text>The Livonian Chronicle of Henry () is a Latin narrative of events in Livonia (roughly corresponding to today&#x27;s Estonia and Latvia) and surrounding areas from 1180 to 1227. It was written by a priest named Henry. Apart from some references in &quot;&quot; – a patriotic work by the 12th-century Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus – and few mentions in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; compiled in Kievan Rus&#x27;, the Chronicle of Henry is the oldest known written document about the history of Estonia and Latvia.

==Background==

Papal calls for renewed holy war at the end of the twelfth century inspired not only the disastrous Fourth Crusade that sacked Constantinople in 1204, but also a series of simultaneous &quot;Northern Crusades&quot; that are less fully covered in English-language popular history, but which were more successful in the long run. Before the crusades, the region of medieval Livonia was a mixed outpost, a mostly &quot;pagan&quot; society where merchants from the Hanseatic League encountered merchants of Novgorod, and where Teutonic, Scandinavian, and Slavic trade, culture, and cults all mingled. The specific ethnic groups that intermingled and traded with the Saxons, Danes, Swedes, Wends, merchants from Lübeck, Novgorod and Pskov here were the Estonians, Karelians, Curonians, Latgalians, Semigallians (sometimes known as the Letts), Livonians and the Lithuanians. The Western merchants would trade silver, textiles, and other luxury goods for furs, beeswax, honey, leather, dried fish, and amber. Livonia had been an especially promising location in terms of resources, and Arnold of Lübeck, in his &quot;Chronicle of the Slavs&quot; wrote that the land was &quot;abundant in many riches&quot; and was &quot;fertile in fields, plentiful in pastures, irrigated by rivers&quot;, and &quot;also sufficiently rich in fish and forested with trees&quot;.

Eventually, the Scandinavian rulers and German military knightly orders led by German prince-bishops conquered and resettled the Baltic region, drawing it into Western orbit. &quot;The Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot; was written during the first generation of conversion in Livonia when Albert of Buxhoeveden (later, Bishop of Riga) had authority over the land. The Teutonic Order continued to implement Christianity across Livonia after the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, the crusading army established by Albert of Riga, was absorbed by them in 1237.

This crusade and other Baltic crusades have been debated on their legitimacy to the claim of being labeled as crusades. This is because these crusades were not directed towards the Holy Land as the others before it, meaning that the religious motives were less clear-cut than those that had Jerusalem set as their final destination because Jerusalem has such a strong historical influence in the Christian faith and Livonia and its surroundings had less obvious significance to Christianity.

==Content==

The &quot;Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot; provides eyewitness accounts of the events, with an invaluable and deeply human history. It provides insight, not only into military operations in the East during this tumultuous period but also into the conflicted attitudes of an eyewitness; it reveals the complexities of religious motives enmeshed with political aims. The other famous early Livonian text, the &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot;, has less historical value, as it was essentially intended as a patriotic and Christian courtly entertainment. 

The &quot;Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot; utilizes two major points of justification for the conquest of Livonia: that it was the Land of the Virgin Mary, which began after Bishop Meinhard, the first Bishop who attempted to spread Christianity to Livonia, established a Cult of Mary convent in Livonia. Following this, Albert of Riga also helped perpetuate this association by naming the Episcopal Cathedral in Livonia as the church of the Virgin Mary in the early 1200s. 

The second main justification was that Livonia was comparable to Jerusalem. Pope Innocent III granted the absolution of sins for those making a pilgrimage to Livonia after tensions arose between the German Christians and the pagans. Bishop Meinhard had attempted to convert the pagans without success and also appointed Theoderich von Treyden to help with the Christianization of Livonia. This concerned the people of Livonia, who then plotted to kill Theoderich, which proved unsuccessful but increased German mistrust after the plot&#x27;s discovery. When Pope Innocent III gave absolution of sin to those who went to aid in the Christianization of Livonia, Henry makes the association between the lands of Livonia and Jerusalem by stating, &quot;In enjoining the Livonian pilgrimage for the plenary remission of sins, made it equal with that to Jerusalem&quot; (Brundage, &quot;CHL&quot;, 36). Honorius III and Gregory IX continued to promote Livonia as comparable to Jerusalem by enforcing privileges (including the protection of property) to Livonian crusaders. 

Other reasons include justification on the basis of the defense of Christianity, the conversion of pagans, and the return of apostates to Christianity. Many have questioned to what extent the Christianization of Livonia was in fact about commercial and political gains. Henry mentions in his chronicle that there was a notable number of German merchants in the crusading army, but does not describe their stake in the crusade. Conversely, in the &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot;, the writer states that these merchants would, &quot;Sell [their wares] to greater advantage there than elsewhere&quot;. Politically, because Livonia was so rich in natural resources and was such an important trading hub for so many nations and people, gaining political control over this land would bring political advancement to Germany over the other nations that were vying for the resources that existed in Livonia during this time. The modern English translator of the &quot;Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot;, James A. Brundage, also argues that the German popes, kings, bishops, and dukes would have been aware of the existing positive economic and political potential in Livonia.

The chronicles consist of four books.

* The first book, &quot;On Livonia&quot; describes events between 1186 and 1196: the arrival of the first bishop of Ikšķile, Meinhard, and the baptizing of Livonians.
* The second book, &quot;On bishop Berthold&quot; describes events between 1196 and 1198: the arrival of the second bishop of Ikšķile Berthold of Hanover and his death in the battle with Livonians near what later became the town of Riga. 
* The third book, &quot;On bishop Albert&quot; describes events between 1198 and 1208: the arrival of third bishop of Ikšķile, Albert of Buxhoeveden, the foundation of the Christian knightly order of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, the conquest and dividing of Livonian territories between the Bishopric of Livonia and the Order, the wars with the Princes of Polotsk and Lithuanians, conquest of the Principality of Koknese and the country of Selonians. 
*The fourth book, &quot;On Estonia&quot; describes events between 1208 and 1226: the campaigns against Estonian counties, the conquest of the Principality of Jersika, the wars with Curonians, Semigallians, Lithuanians and the princes of Pskov and Novgorod.

The original manuscript of the chronicle has not been preserved. There are sixteen different copies, dating from 14th to 19th century, the oldest of which is the &quot;Codex Zamoscianus&quot;, written on parchment and dating from the end of the 13th century. The &quot;Codex Zamoscianus&quot; is incomplete, as the text of the Chronicle ends in the 23rd chapter. The &quot;Codex Zamoscianus&quot; is presently kept in the Polish National Library in Warsaw.

English online material on the chronicle is rather scarce, though there are some excerpts . The Latin copy in the Polish National Library is available online.

A modern translation of the chronicle was published in 1961 (2nd ed. 2004) by James A Brundage and is available through Columbia University Press.

==Author==

The author of the chronicle is Henry of Latvia (&quot;Henricus de Lettis&quot;). Henry was a Catholic priest who witnessed most of the events described in the chronicle. He was born between 1180 and 1188, most likely in Germany. He bears a German forename and consistently refers to Germans in the first person plural although it is also possible that he came from Livonia. Henry also had a thoroughly German and Catholic education and as a youth was attached to the household of the Prince-Bishop Albert of Buxhoeveden, later known as Albert of Riga, who was ordained a priest in 1208 and who founded a parish and lived out his life in peace. Henry most likely wrote the &quot;Chronicle of Livonia&quot; in dedication to Albert of Buxhoeveden, who died in 1229, likely around the same time that this chronicle was written. It is unknown whether or not the author contributed any additional written work before or after writing this chronicle.

Henry&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; is written from the clerical point of view, that the history of the Church was the essential history of Livonia. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; may have originated as a report to the papal legate William of Modena, to whom he was assigned as an interpreter in 1225 through 1227. The legate, one of the papacy&#x27;s most able diplomats, was in Livonia to mediate an internal church dispute between the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, and the territorial claims of the Catholic bishops of Livonia.

== Assessment ==

For many episodes in the early stages of the Christianization of the peoples of the eastern Baltic, the Chronicle of Henry is the major surviving evidence aside from the &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;.

&quot;The Livonian Chronicle of Henry&quot; has been highlighted for the purpose of understanding the complexities of crusading ideology because it describes the religious motives used to justify the crusade as well as alluding to the potential economic and political benefits that were existent in the Christianization of Livonia by mentioning the fact that there were merchants who were present in the crusading army. This chronicle is also an example of a crusader document that implements opinionated and demeaning rhetoric towards the people they were conquering, especially when describing the nature of the pagans when Bishop Meinhard initially fails to convert them without the use of force by promising to build them forts if they would accept baptism. Many of the pagans accepted this offer but didn&#x27;t have intentions to change their faith to Christianity. When it was discovered that these people were still practicing their pagan beliefs and rituals, many of those involved in implementing the crusade, including Henry himself, expressed their disapproval and judgments of these individuals.

<doc id="572568" wikidata="Q2461272" url="?curid=572568" title="Sea Wolf (missile)">
<text>Sea Wolf is a naval surface-to-air missile system designed and built by BAC, later to become British Aerospace (BAe) Dynamics, and now MBDA. It is an automated point-defence weapon system designed as a short-range defence against both sea-skimming and high angle anti-ship missiles and aircraft. The Royal Navy has fielded two versions, the GWS-25 Conventionally Launched Sea Wolf (CLSW) and the GWS-26 Vertically Launched Sea Wolf (VLSW) forms. In Royal Navy service Sea Wolf is being replaced by Sea Ceptor.

==History==

The earliest point-defence missile used by the Royal Navy was the Seacat, which had been rapidly developed from an earlier anti-tank missile design, the Malkara. As a weapon originally designed to operate against slow-moving ground vehicles, the missile had subsonic performance and was of limited capability against even early jet aircraft. It was used largely due to the ease which it could be adapted to the role simply by replacing the original wire guidance system with a radio command link, and that its small size allowed multi-round launchers to be fitted to ships in place of their Bofors 40 mm guns. It entered service in 1961, the first point-defence missile to do so.

The limited performance was understood to be a problem from the start and a requirement for a higher performance replacement was published in 1964. British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) won a 1967 development contract along with Vickers and Bristol Aerojet. Although only slightly longer and heavier than Seacat, Sea Wolf offered dramatically higher performance, with a top speed on the order of Mach 3, an effective range roughly double that of Seacat, and a fully automated guidance system that made engagements much simpler.

Testing lasted from 1970 until 1977, with shipborne trials on a modified &quot;Leander&quot; class frigate, , from 1976. Sea Wolf was tested with a vertical launch system early in the development period on a modified &quot;Loch&quot; class frigate, but for obscure reasons work did not continue in this direction: the GWS-26 &quot;VL Seawolf (VLS)&quot; being a much later (1980s) development. During trials, the missile performed impressively, once intercepting a shell.

The first deployment, in the GWS-25 form, was on the Type 22 frigate (2 systems) and later on modified &quot;Leander&quot; class frigates (1 system) in six-round, manually-loaded trainable launchers. It entered service with the Royal Navy in 1979 and was used during the Falklands War. The current version is the GWS-26 Mod 1 system on Type 23 frigates, fielding 32 vertical launch missiles (VL Sea Wolf) in its missile silo. It is expected to remain in service until 2020.

==Description==
Sea Wolf is powered by the &quot;Blackcap&quot; solid-fuel rocket to a maximum velocity of Mach 2, and can intercept targets at ranges between and altitudes from to . The warhead weighs and is a proximity fuzed HE-fragmenting type. In the manually loaded form, the missiles are stored on board in maintenance-free canisters, sealed until use and handled like a round of ammunition.

===Fire control===
The standard mode is fully automated and uses radar tracking. Target detection is carried out using the ship&#x27;s surveillance radars. In the Type 22- and Sea Wolf-equipped &quot;Leander&quot; class, this was the radar Type 967–968 combination; the D-band Type 967 providing long-range surveillance and the E-band Type 968 providing short-range target indication. On the Type 23 frigates, these functions have been taken over by the Type 996 3D surveillance radar. Target data is processed by the ship&#x27;s computers and when the system is live, targets are automatically assigned and engaged automatically (although this can be over-ridden by the Missile Director (MD) in the Operations Room).

When a target is to be engaged, the ship&#x27;s computer slews one of the two Sea Wolf trackers onto the target (there was a single tracker on a Sea Wolf &quot;Leander&quot;). Originally the Type 910, with an I-band radar, was used but this suffered from poor performance locking onto low-altitude targets hidden in the background sea clutter in the Falklands War. Low-level targets had to be engaged using the 910&#x27;s secondary TV mode to manually track the target. The lighter Type 911 supplanted the Type 910, adding a second radar (a K-band set based on the &quot;Blindfire&quot; tracker of the Rapier missile, to control engagements at low level) and was fitted in the 7th &quot;Type 22&quot; Frigate onwards. Unlike Type 910, Type 911 does not have any TV function; the TV camera is retained only to allow the Missile Director to visually confirm targets and to provide a record of engagements.

As the &quot;Leander&quot; and &quot;Type 22&quot; classes did not possess a 3D radar set, the altitude of the target had to be aquired by the tracker itself by vertically scanning the airspace on the bearing given by a target indication radar (Type 967–968) until a target lock could be acquired. When lock has been achieved by the missile tracker and the system&#x27;s rules of engagement were fullfiled, a round is fired and tracked by a pair of radio beacons in the missile&#x27;s tail. The ship-board system constantly measures the angle differences between the target and the missile and issues guidance commands to the missile through an Automatic Command to Line of Sight (ACLOS) device transmitting on a microwave link controlling the rear fins of the missile. It is possible for a tracker to control a salvo of two missiles. The radar and CCTV guidance system were developed by Marconi Radar at Great Baddow, Essex. The guidance receiver was developed and built by Plessey Avionics and Communications in Ilford, Essex.

==Combat performance==

During the Falklands War, Sea Wolf was the Royal Navy&#x27;s only modern point-defence weapon. It equipped the Type 22 frigates HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot;, and the Batch 3A Leander class frigate . These ships were assigned &quot;goalkeeper&quot; duties, to provide close anti-aircraft defence of the carrier task force.

In an attempt to overcome the fleet&#x27;s overall air defence deficiency following the loss of , a new tactic was devised, which saw each of the two Type 22 frigates paired with each of the two remaining Type 42 (area air defence) destroyers. The pairing was unofficially termed &quot;Type 64&quot;, the sum of both classes numbers. The two pairs were deployed some distance from the main fleet, covering likely attack routes, in an attempt to draw attacking aircraft into a &quot;missile trap&quot;, the intention being that, if the Type 42 was unable to engage targets at longer ranges with its Sea Dart missiles, the Type 22 would use its short-range Sea Wolf missiles to defend both ships.

On 12 May 1982, &quot;Brilliant&quot; and were operating in combination and were attacked by two flights of four Argentine Douglas A-4 Skyhawk aircraft. &quot;Brilliant&quot; shot down two of these and caused a third to crash trying to avoid the missile. The second wave of aircraft attacked during a failure of the missile system and the Type 42 &quot;Glasgow&quot; sustained damage.

On 25 May 1982, and &quot;Broadsword&quot; also operating in a 22/42 combination to the north-west of Falkland Sound came under attack by two waves of two A-4 Skyhawks. &quot;Broadsword&quot; attempted to target the first pair with Sea Wolf but the tracking system locked down and could not be reset before the aircraft released their bombs. &quot;Broadsword&quot; was hit by one bomb, which bounced up through the deck and destroyed her Westland Lynx helicopter. The second pair of Skyhawks headed for &quot;Coventry&quot; 90 seconds later at a 20-degree angle to her port bow. On &quot;Broadsword&quot; the Sea Wolf system had been reset and acquired the attacking aircraft but &quot;Coventry&quot;″s evasive manoeuvring took her through the line of fire and the lock was lost. &quot;Coventry&quot; was struck by three bombs and sank shortly after.

Sea Wolf suffered from problems with hardware failure causing launches to fail, broken locks from the extreme sea conditions and the Argentines&#x27; low-altitude hit-and-run tactics with multiple, crossing targets which it was not designed to intercept.

Sea Wolf accounted for three confirmed &quot;kills&quot; and two further possibles from eight launches.

==Variants==
===Vertical launch (VL) Sea Wolf GWS-26===
Instead of a launcher that is aimed at the target by the fire-control system, VL Sea Wolf uses a vertical-launch system (VLS). Missiles are launched vertically by a Cadiz booster motor and turnover pack, to clear the ship&#x27;s superstructure and rapidly flipped onto their flight path by thrust vectoring. The booster motor, which also increases the range of VL Sea Wolf from to , then separates from the missile, which flies on to engage the target.

Although vertical launch had been explored much earlier in Sea Wolf&#x27;s development, it was not until the 1980s that a production design was undertaken. VLS went into service, using the GWS-26 system, on the Type 23 frigate . Type 23 frigates have a 32-cell VLS, each cell holding one VL Sea Wolf for a total of 32 missiles. The cells, or canisters, are housed vertically in the ship&#x27;s magazine such that the top of the canisters protrude from the magazine.

===Block 2===
Block 2 Sea Wolf is a replenishment upgrade to the existing stocks of Sea Wolf missiles. Block 2 missiles have replaced all Sea Wolf missiles, both on Type 22 and Type 23 frigates, as part of normal ammunition replenishment operations. In a parallel programme (&quot;Sea Wolf Mid-Life Update&quot;) the associated Type 911 tracker is being upgraded by the addition of an infra-red camera, enhanced tracking software and new operator&#x27;s consoles.

===GWS-27===
Proposed &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; development with an active radar seeker instead of command guidance for dealing with saturation attacks. GWS-27 was cancelled in 1987.

===Lightweight Sea Wolf===

Sea Wolf was not designed as a particularly lightweight system, the original GWS-25 variant with Type 910 tracking required of tracking and below-decks fire-control equipments, reduced to with the upgraded Type 911 tracker. The &quot;broad-beam&quot; &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigate of standard displacement could carry only a single missile system, and required some significant structural &quot;surgery&quot; of the upperworks to counteract the weight of the new missile system. Sea Wolf in its original guise cannot therefore be easily added to existing vessels. For this reason, the Lightweight Sea Wolf variant was designed to use a four-missile launcher, similar in form to that of the obsolete Sea Cat system. It was intended to equip the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Invincible&quot; class carriers and Type 42 destroyers to supplement the medium range Sea Dart system, which was not as capable of intercepting sea-skimming missiles. However, it was cancelled before it entered service.

== Replacement ==
At the DSEI conference in September 2007 it was announced that the UK Ministry of Defence was funding a study by MBDA to investigate a replacement for Sea Wolf which is scheduled to leave service about 2018. MBDA was later contracted to replace the Vertical-Launch Sea Wolf weapons system on the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 23 frigates as part of the &quot;Future Local Anti-air Defence System (Maritime)&quot; or FLAADS(M). The system chosen was the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM) which would be known in Royal Navy service as &quot;Sea Ceptor&quot; and will also be jointly used by the British Army&#x27;s new Sky Sabre air defence system under the name &quot;Land Ceptor&quot;. CAMM is derived from and shares components with the Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) missile in service with the Royal Air Force.

Sea Ceptor entered service on the Type 23 frigates in 2018 replacing the Sea Wolf and will also be integrated onto the forthcoming Type 26 and Type 31 frigates when they enter service in the late 2020s. Sea Ceptor will also replace the Aster 15 missiles on the Type 45 Destroyers between 2026 and 2032.

<text>Tharangambadi (), formerly Tranquebar (, ), is a town in the Mayiladuthurai district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu on the Coromandel Coast. It lies north of Karaikal, near the mouth of a distributary named Uppanar of the Kaveri River. It was established on 19 November 1620 as the first Danish trading post in India. King Christian IV had sent his envoy Ove Gjedde who established contact with Raghunatha Nayak of Thanjavur. An annual tribute was paid by the Danes to the Rajah of Tanjore until the colony was sold to the British East India Company in 1845.

Tharangambadi is the headquarters of Tharangambadi taluk. Its name means &quot;place of the singing waves&quot;; the old designation &quot;Trankebar&quot; remains current in modern Danish. Tharangambadi is located at the distance of 285 km from Chennai. The nearest airport is Tiruchirappalli International Airport, 172 km away and the nearest port is at Karaikal at 26 km. It is served by Tharangambadi railway station.

==History==
The place dates back to the 14th century. Masilamani nathar (Shiva) temple was built in 1306, in a land given by Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I. As of now, this temple is the oldest monument. Until 1620, when the Danes came, the place was under Thanjavur Nayak kingdom. Danish admiral Ove Gjedde felt the place would be a potential trading centre, made a deal with Raghunatha Nayak and built a fort, which is known as Fort Dansborg. In 1644, Dansborg was besieged, yet the siege became inconclusive.

A Jesuit Catholic congregation in Tranquebar predated the arrival of the Danes by several decades. This congregation descended from Tamil fishermen converted by Portuguese missionaries. There was also a sizable population of Indo-Portuguese due to their presence nearby in Nagapattinam. The Catholic church was probably demolished to build the fort. This fort was the residence and headquarters of the governor and other officials for about 150 years. It is now a museum hosting a collection of artifacts from the colonial era.

In 1639, experienced seafarer, Willem Leyel, was sent to Tranquebar on the order of Christian IV of Denmark to inspect the Danish East India Company&#x27;s troublesome financial conditions. The Tranquebar Rebellion in 1648 may have started as a response to Leyel making a treaty with the Mughals to stop local Danish piracy. It was followed by a show trial that returned him to Denmark, and thus ending commercial oversight by the Crown. Two years later, Frederick III abolished the company. Although the company had been abolished, the colony was a royal property and still held by a garrison unaware of court developments back at home. As the number of Danes-Norwegians declined through desertions and illness, an illiterate commoner, Eskild Anderson Kongsbakke was loyal to his country and successfully held the fort until May of 1669; when the Crown dispatched the frigate Færø to re-establish an official outpost.

Among the first Protestant missionaries to set foot in India were two Lutherans from Germany, Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Pluetschau, who began work in 1705 in the Danish settlement of Tranquebar. Ziegenbalg translated the Old and New Testaments into Tamil, imported a printing press, and printed the New Testament in Tamil in 1714.
Bible translations into the Tamil language started with the arrival of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg at Tranquebar in 1706. He was a member of the Lutheran clergy who responded to the appeal of King Frederick IV of Denmark to establish a mission for the natives of Tranquebar. They also established a printing press, which within a hundred years of its establishment in 1712 had printed 300 books in Tamil. At first they only made little progress in their religious efforts, but gradually the mission spread to Madras, Cuddalore and Tanjore. Today &quot;Bishop of Tranquebar&quot; is the official title of a bishop in the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church (TELC) in South India which was founded in 1919 as a result of the German Lutheran Leipzig Mission and Church of Sweden Mission. The seat of the Bishop, the Cathedral and its Church House (&quot;Tranquebar House&quot;) is in Tiruchirappalli.

The Zion church was consecrated in 1701, which is the oldest Protestant church in India. In 1718, The New Jerusalem Church was constructed. Moravian Brethren missionaries from Herrnhut, Saxony established the Brethren&#x27;s Garden at Porayar near Tranquebar and operated it as a missionary centre for a number of years. An Italian Catholic Father Constanzo Beschi, who worked in the colony from 1711 to 1740, found himself in conflict with the Lutheran pioneers at Tranquebar, against whom he wrote several polemical works.

Tranquebar was occupied by the British in February 1808 during the Napoleonic Wars but was restored to Denmark following the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. Along with the Danish settlement of Serampore in Bengal, it was sold to the British in 1845. Tranquebar was then still a busy port, but it later lost its importance after a railway was opened to Nagapattinam.

The Subrahmanya Temple, Perambur, located in the outskirts of the town is one of the most prominent Murugan temples in the region.

===Tranquebar Museum===

The 17th and 18th century antiquities and relics from the Vijayanagara empire and Thanjavur Nayak kingdom, which authorised, allowed, and sanctioned the aforementioned Danish port township connected with the colonial period and Danish settlement at Tharangampadi are exhibited. The museum contains porcelain ware, Danish manuscripts, glass objects, Chinese tea jars, steatite lamps, decorated terracotta objects, figurines, lamps, stones, sculptures, swords, daggers, spears, sudai (stucco) figurines and wooden objects. There is also part of a whale skeleton, a giant sawfish rostrum and small cannonballs.

===New Jerusalem Church===

The New Jerusalem Church was built in 1718 by the Royal Danish missionary Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg in the coastal town of Tranquebar, India which was at that time a Danish India colony. The church is located on King Street, and church services are conducted every Sunday. The church, along with other buildings of the Tranquebar Mission was damaged during the tsunami of 2004, and were renovated at a cost of 7 million, and re-consecrated in 2006.

===Fort Dansborg===

Construction of Fort Dansborg started in 1620. Many parts of the fort have been reconstructed several times. Dansborg is the second largest Danish fort ever constructed, with Kronborg in Helsingør being the largest. The rampart wall is a fairly large four sided structure, with bastions at each cardinal point. A single storied building was constructed along three inner sides of the rampart, with barracks, warehouse, kitchen, and jail. The rooms on the southern side remain in good condition, but the rooms on the western and northern sides have been substantially damaged. On the eastern side of the fort, there was a two storied building facing the sea. It was the main building of the fort. The vaulted lower storey served as a magazine and a warehouse, while the vaulted upper storey contained the church and the lodgings of the governor, the senior merchants, and the chaplain. The sea on the eastern and western side protected the fort. The fort was surrounded by a moat, access to the fort being over a drawbridge. The moat has completely disappeared. Today none of the fort&#x27;s door openings and windows have doors in them. It is believed that during the end of their colonisation period, the Danish ran into financial issues. To make ends meet, they pulled out the metal doors, molded them into weapons and sold them.

==Demographics==
 India census, Tharangambadi had a population of 20,841. Males constitute 48% of the population and females 52%. Tharangambadi has an average literacy rate of 74%, similar to the national average of 74.5%: male literacy is 79%, and female literacy is 69%. In Tharangambadi, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age.

<text>Baron Armstrong is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The first creation came on 6 July 1887 when the industrialist Sir William Armstrong was made Baron Armstrong, of Cragside in the County of Northumberland. The title became extinct on his death in 1900. The title was revived three years later, on 4 August 1903, for his great-nephew William Watson-Armstrong, who was created Baron Armstrong, of Bamburgh and of Cragside in the County of Northumberland. Born William Watson, he had assumed the additional surname of Armstrong by Royal licence in 1889.

Lord Armstrong was the grandson of Sir William Henry Watson, Baron of the Exchequer, by his wife Anne, sister of the first Baron of the first creation. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He unsuccessfully contested Berwick-on-Tweed as an independent candidate in the 1918 general election. The title became extinct from the male line in 1987 on the death of his son, the third Baron.

==Barons Armstrong; First creation (1887)==
*William George Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong (1810–1900)

==Barons Armstrong; Second creation (1903)==
*William Henry Armstrong Fitzpatrick Watson-Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong (1863–1941)
*William John Montagu Watson-Armstrong, 2nd Baron Armstrong (1892–1972)

He married Baroness Maria-Theresa Chiodelli-Manzoni in 1947 and adopted two children: a son, Francis, and a daughter, Isabella. Francis Watson-Armstrong has three children, William, Rosie and Juliet, and owns the Bamburgh Castle estate.

<text>Jesús Manuel Ramos García (April 12, 1918 – September 2, 1977) was a Venezuelan outfielder/first baseman in Major League Baseball who played briefly during the season. Listed at 5&#x27; 10.5&quot;, 167 lb., Ramos batted right-handed and threw left-handed. Born in Maturín, Venezuela, he played under the name Chucho Ramos.

==Career==
Ramos became the third player to go straight into the major leagues with no minor league experience, following Ted Lyons () and Alex Carrasquel (). He also was the second Venezuelan player to appear in a major league game, behind fellow countryman Carrasquel.

Ramos was heralded as an outstanding defensive player, but back problems shortened his career. He made his majors debut on May 7, 1944 in the National League with the Cincinnati Reds, and went 3-for-4 off Max Lanier of the St. Louis Cardinals. In his brief stint with Cincinnati, Ramos went 5-for-10 for a .500 batting average in four games, including a double and one run.

Resuming his career, Ramos played during 12 seasons (1946–1955) for the Magallanes team of the Venezuelan Baseball League, hitting .271 with 12 home runs and 162 RBI.

Ramos died of respiratory failure in Caracas, Venezuela, at age of 59.
