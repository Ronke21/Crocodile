<text>Charles Burgess Fry (25 April 1872 – 7 September 1956) was an English sportsman, teacher, writer, editor and publisher, who is best remembered for his career as a cricketer. John Arlott described him with the words: &quot;Charles Fry could be autocratic, angry and self-willed: he was also magnanimous, extravagant, generous, elegant, brilliant – and fun ... he was probably the most variously gifted Englishman of any age.&quot;

Fry&#x27;s achievements on the sporting field included representing England at both cricket and football, an FA Cup Final appearance for Southampton and equalling the then-world record for the long jump. He also reputedly turned down the throne of Albania. In later life, he suffered mental health problems, but even well into his seventies he claimed he was still able to perform his party trick: leaping from a stationary position backwards onto a mantelpiece.

==Education==
C. B. Fry was born in Croydon, the son of a civil servant. Both sides of his family had once been wealthy, but by 1872 were not as prosperous. After winning a scholarship, Fry was educated at Repton School and then at Wadham College, Oxford. His greatest strength academically was in the Classics. At Repton, he won the school prizes for Latin Verse, Greek Verse, Latin Prose and French. He was also runner-up in German. His weakest subject was mathematics; he gained the headmaster&#x27;s permission to study Thucydides instead and dispensed with maths for the rest of his academic career.

Repton has a strong tradition in football and Fry played for the under-16 Repton football side in his first term, aged thirteen. He went on to captain both the school&#x27;s cricket and football teams, and also won prizes for athletics. At the age of sixteen he played for the Casuals in the F.A. Cup.

Having won a further scholarship to study at Wadham College, Oxford, he won his university Blue in football, cricket and athletics, but narrowly failed to win a Blue in rugby union because of an injury. Fry&#x27;s status brought him into the orbit of people whose fame was already spreading far beyond Oxford, such as Max Beerbohm, the writer and caricaturist. He gained a first in classical moderations.

When Fry was only 21, the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; published a caricature of him in its issue of 19 April 1894, with the comment: &quot;He is sometimes known as &quot;C.B.&quot;; but it has lately been suggested that he should be called &#x27;Charles III&#x27;.&quot;

In his final term at Oxford, Fry experienced his first (but not last) bout of mental illness, suffering a mental breakdown. There were a number of contributing factors to this. During his time at Oxford, Fry had accumulated significantly large debts. In an attempt to alleviate his financial difficulties, Fry capitalised on his reputation to make some much-needed money. As well as writing articles (including one for &quot;Wisden&quot;), he did some private tutoring but although such activities reduced his debts they did not clear them and further increased the intense pressure on his time. Fry&#x27;s continuing indebtedness provides the most obvious explanation for his acceptance of an offer to do some nude modelling. These financial problems combined with his mother being seriously ill, placed an unbearable strain on him. Although he was able to sit his final exams, he was hardly in any fit state to do so, having hardly read a line for weeks. The result was Fry scraping a Fourth, bringing one of Oxford&#x27;s most spectacular and successful careers to an inglorious end. In the summer of 1895, only months after being the toast of Oxford, Fry found himself saddled with mounting debts and no way with which to repay them. In the short term, cricket came to his rescue. He was offered, and accepted, the chance to tour South Africa as a member of Lord Hawke&#x27;s 1895–96 England touring party.

==Personal life==
In 1898, Fry married Beatrice Holme Sumner (1862–1946), daughter of Arthur Holme Sumner, of Hatchlands Park, Guildford, Surrey; they had three children. Beatrice was ten years Fry&#x27;s senior, and known for her &#x27;fiery, strong-willed, aggressive&#x27; personality; she was reckoned to be &#x27;a cruel and domineering woman&#x27;, and Fry &#x27;lived in fear of her for the duration of their marriage&#x27;, as &#x27;she made him thoroughly miserable and he tried to stay away from her as much as possible&#x27;. His unhappy marriage impacted Fry&#x27;s mental health; his daughter-in-law observed: &#x27;I should think anyone would have a breakdown married to her&quot;. At Beatrice&#x27;s death, they had been married for 48 years; Fry &#x27;adjusted to her death with great equanimity and even her children showed all the freedom of the newly liberated&#x27;. Their son Stephen later said: &#x27;My mother ruined my father&#x27;s life&#x27;. He and his son, Charles Fry, also played first-class cricket.

==Sporting career==
Apart from his other sporting achievements stated below, Fry was also a decent shot putter, hammer thrower and ice skater, representing Wadham in the inter-College races on Blenheim lake in the winter of 1894–95 and coming close to an unofficial Blue as a member of the Oxford team who took on Cambridge on the Fens, as well as being a proficient golfer.

===Cricket===
Fry played for Surrey in 1891 (but not in any first-class fixtures), Oxford University 1892–1895 (winning Blues in all four years and captaining the university in 1894, meaning that he was simultaneously not only captain of both the university cricket and football teams but president of the varsity athletics club as well) Sussex 1894–1908 (captain 1904–1908), and Hampshire, 1909–1921. First selected by England for the tour of South Africa in 1895–96, he captained England in his final six Test matches in 1912, winning four and drawing two. He twice scored Test centuries: 144 v Australia in 1905 hitting 23 fours in just over hours, batting at number four, and 129 opening the batting against South Africa in 1907.

As a highly effective right-handed batsman who batted at, or near the top of the order, Fry scored 30,886 first-class runs at an average of 50.22, a particularly high figure for an era when scores were generally lower than today. At the end of his cricketing career in 1921–22, he had the second highest average of any retired player with over 10,000 runs: only his Sussex and England colleague Ranjitsinhji had retired with a better career average. He headed the batting averages (qualification minimum 20 innings) for six English seasons (in 1901, 1903, 1905, 1907, 1911 and 1912). Against Yorkshire, the strongest county bowling attack of Fry&#x27;s time, he averaged a remarkable 63.60 over the course of his career, including back to back scores of 177 and 229 against them in 1904. GL Jessop said that calmness was at the heart of his batting and that he was a superb judge of a run as well as being fast between the wickets.
In his early career Fry was an enthusiastic and successful right-arm fast-medium bowler. He returned his career best figures of 6–78 in the 1895 Varsity match, and he twice took ten wickets in a match: 5–75 and 5–102 for the Gentlemen of England against I Zingari in 1895, and 5–81 and 5–66 for Sussex against Nottinghamshire in 1896 (a match in which he also scored 89 and 65). The late 1890s saw a re-emergence of the throwing controversy in cricket. Several professional bowlers including Arthur Mold and Ernie Jones were no-balled; Mold was forced to retire. Fry&#x27;s bowling action was criticised by opponents and teammates, and it was only a matter of time before he too was no-balled by umpire Jim Phillips.

Fry scored 94 first-class centuries, including an unprecedented six consecutive centuries in 1901. No one else has scored more consecutive hundreds. On 12 September 1901, playing for the Rest of England against Yorkshire at Lord&#x27;s, he scored 105, which was his sixth consecutive first-class century. He made his highest first-class score of 258 not out in 1911, a season which led to his recall to the England Test team as captain in 1912. In 1921 Fry was once again considered for the Test side. The Selection Committee asked him to play in the First Test match at Nottingham under the captaincy of Johnny Douglas, with a view to taking over the captaincy for the remainder of the series if, as they anticipated, things went wrong. Fry declined on the basis that there was no sense in recalling a forty-nine-year-old merely as a player, but stated that he would consider returning as captain. As England were badly beaten at Nottingham the Selection Committee again pressed Fry to return for the Second Test but once again he declined, due to poor form. Following another heavy defeat in the Second Test the Selection Committee made a further attempt to persuade Fry to return for the Third Test as captain, a job he was now keen to accept. He injured a finger taking a catch during Hampshire&#x27;s match with the Australians. In the short term, the injury did not appear too serious: he scored a half-century in Hampshire&#x27;s first innings and, when they followed on in reply to the Australians&#x27; massive total he top scored with 37. Furthermore, in his next match against Nottinghamshire he scored 61 in the first innings (but registered a duck in the second). It appears however that the injury was affecting his fielding more than his batting and, for last time, C.B. felt obliged to stand down from the side for the next Test. Fry later commentated on cricket matches, being called &quot;one of the most eloquent cricket commentators of all time.&quot;
For both Sussex and England, he was closely associated with the outstanding cricketer Prince Ranjitsinhji, the future Jam Sahib of Nawanagar. Their contrasting batting styles complemented one another (Fry being an orthodox, technically correct batsman, and Ranji being noted for his innovation, particularly his use of the leg glance). Their friendship lasted well into the 1920s, and when Ranjitsinhji became one of India&#x27;s three representatives at the League of Nations, he took Fry with him as his assistant.

===Athletics===
In athletics, Fry won Blues in all four years at Oxford 1892–95, representing the university against Cambridge in the long jump in 1892, 1893, 1894 and 1895; the high jump in 1892 and the 100 yards in 1893 and 1894. In 1892 Fry broke the British long jump record with a jump of and a year later on 4 March 1893 equalled the world long jump record of (tied with the American Charles Reber). This is often incorrectly claimed to have stood as a world record for 21 years, but this length of time actually only refers to how long he held the university record, Cambridge&#x27;s H. S. O. Ashington adding three-quarters of an inch to Fry&#x27;s distance in 1913. Fry&#x27;s shared world record was broken on 5 September 1894 by Ireland&#x27;s J. J. Mooney.

In the first contest between universities from different countries, Oxford v Yale at the Queen&#x27;s Club, West Kensington, in 1894, Fry came third in the long jump and won the 100 yards. In addition to being an outstanding long jumper, sprinter and high jumper, Fry was also a talented hurdler, once competing against Godfrey Shaw the champion hurdler of the time, who beat him but told him, as Fry later recalled: &quot;He was sure if I took up hurdling seriously I might win the championship.&quot; Fry was also president of the Oxford University athletics club in 1894.

===Football===

Fry&#x27;s achievements extended to association football.

A defender with exceptional pace, Fry learned his football at Repton School, where he played for and captained the school team. While still at school he also played for the famous amateur club the Casuals, for whom he found himself turning out in an FA Cup tie at the age of sixteen. Fry went on to win Blues in each of his four years at Oxford University captaining the side in his third year. In 1891, he joined another famous amateur club, Corinthian, going on to make a total of 74 appearances for them between 1891 and 1903 scoring four goals. Although extremely proud of his amateur status, he decided that entering the professional game would enhance his chance of international honours. He chose Southampton F.C. (&quot;The Saints&quot;), as the leading lights in the Southern League, and also because The Dell was conveniently close to his home. He made his debut for Southampton (as an amateur) on 26 December 1900, against Tottenham Hotspur and went on to help them win the Southern League title during that 1900–01 season.

Fry&#x27;s game was probably a little too refined for the hurly-burly of professional football, he never relished the aerial challenges that were more prevalent in the professional game, but having worked tirelessly to improve his heading ability he achieved his aim of international honours when (along with Southampton&#x27;s goalkeeper, Jack Robinson), he was picked to play as a full-back for England in the match against Ireland on 9 March 1901 (played in Southampton).

The following season (1901–02), Southampton reached the FA Cup Final, playing against Sheffield United, which was drawn 1–1, but Southampton lost the replay, 2–1. Although he had moments during the cup run in which he excelled, his positional play was sometimes questioned. Fry played in all eight of the FA Cup games for Southampton that season, but in only nine Southern League matches, with Bill Henderson being forced to give way whenever Fry was available. The following season, he played twice at centre forward, without success, but Southampton released him partly due to his lack of availability. Fry made 25 first-team appearances for Southampton. He then joined Southampton&#x27;s local rivals Portsmouth, making his debut for them on 21 January 1903. Fry made three appearances for Portsmouth (as an amateur) before retiring from football due to injury.

===Rugby union===

Fry played rugby union for Oxford University, narrowly missing out on a Blue in his final year due to injury, Blackheath, for whom he made ten appearances, and the Barbarians, for whom he made three appearances. Fry was also chosen, as he later recalled, as the &quot;first reserve for the South against the North&quot; – a match that was, in effect, an England trial. Unfortunately for Fry, no one pulled out before the match and, as there were no substitutions allowed in rugby at the time, he did not get to play.

===Acrobatics===
Fry&#x27;s party trick was to leap from a stationary position on the floor backwards onto a mantelpiece; he would face the mantelpiece, crouch down, take a leap upwards, turn in the air, and bow to the gallery with his feet planted on the shelf. Persuasion would occasionally get him to perform this turn at country houses, much to the interest of the guests.

==Career outside sport==

===Teaching===
In 1896 Fry took up a teaching position at Charterhouse. Two years later in 1898 he left the profession, moving on to a successful and much more lucrative and less time-consuming career in journalism. He later recalled: &quot;I could earn by journalism three times the income for the expenditure of a tenth of the time.&quot; In December 1908 he became the Captain Superintendent of the Training Ship &quot;Mercury&quot;, a nautical school primarily designed to prepare boys for service in the Royal Navy; this was run by his wife Beatrice from 1885 to 1946, she having founded the school with her lover (and father of her illegitimate children), the rich banker Charles Hoare. She subjected the boys, &#x27;hounded from morn to night&#x27;, to &#x27;barbarities&#x27; including ceremonial floggings of extreme violence and forced boxing matches inflicted as punishment. Fry held this position until he resigned to make way for a younger man in 1950. Eventually he was given the rank of captain in the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR). Alan Gibson wrote: &quot;He ... would stride about in his uniform looking, as I think it was Robertson-Glasgow who said, every inch like six admirals.&quot; Interviewed about the &quot;Mercury&quot;, and his role in its development, he was addressed as &#x27;Commander C. B. Fry&#x27;.

===Politics===

As far back as his time at Wadham College, Fry had been interested in politics, but admitted: &quot;I take a great interest in heaps of things that I know nothing about ... politics for one&quot;.

In 1920 when his friend and former Sussex teammate Ranjitsinhji was offered and accepted the chance to become one of India&#x27;s three representatives at the newly created League of Nations in Geneva he took Fry with him as his assistant. It was whilst working for Ranjitsinhji at the League of Nations, in Geneva, that Fry claimed to have been offered the throne of Albania. Whether this offer genuinely occurred has been questioned, but Fry was definitely approached about the vacant Albanian throne and therefore seems to have been considered a credible candidate for the post.

He stood (unsuccessfully) as a Liberal candidate for parliament for the Brighton constituency in 1922. Fry&#x27;s presence certainly brought some welcome glamour and excitement to the election, and his campaign was given extra colour by the appearance, at an election meeting, of Dame Clara Butt, the opera singer (and a close personal friend of the Frys). He won 22,059 votes, 4,785 fewer than the Conservative victor.

He later fought the seat of Banbury in 1923, losing by just 219 votes, and the Oxford by-election in 1924, where he was defeated by 1,842 votes.










===Writing, editing, publishing and broadcasting===

Books by Fry include:
*&quot;The Book of Cricket: A New Gallery of Famous Players&quot; (1899), editor, appeared in 14 weekly parts.
*&quot;Giants of the Game: Being Reminiscences of the Stars of Cricket from Daft Down to the Present Day&quot; (c. 1900), with R. H. Lyttleton, W. J. Ford &amp; George Giffen.
*&quot;Great Batsmen: Their Methods at a Glance&quot; (1905), with George W Beldam, who provided the photographs.
*&quot;Great Bowlers and Fielders: Their Methods at a Glance&quot; (1907), with George W. Beldam
*&quot;A Mother&#x27;s Son&quot; (1907), a novel written in collaboration with his wife.
*&quot;Cricket: Batsmanship&quot; (1912).
*&quot;Key-Book of The League of Nations&quot;.
*&quot;Life Worth Living: Some Phases Of An Englishman&quot; (1939), his autobiography.
*&quot;Cricket on the Green For Club And Village Cricketers And For Boys&quot; (1947), with R. S. Young.
He is also believed to have written much of &quot;The Jubilee Book of Cricket&quot; (1897), of which the nominal author was Ranji. He wrote prefaces and introductions for a number of other cricket books, and wrote articles on cricket and football for &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the early years of the 20th century. In the 1930s, he wrote a column for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, which covered many topics. The column was credited with a considerable increase in the paper&#x27;s circulation. He launched and edited &quot;C. B. Fry&#x27;s Magazine.&quot; In his magazine he promoted toys such as the diabolo. A History and Bibliography of Fry&#x27;s Magazine was published in December 2022 by Sports History Publishing.

His broadcasting career began in 1936 with commentary for the BBC on a match between Middlesex and Surrey. He declined to join the panel on &quot;Any Questions&quot; but in 1945 began a successful stint on &quot;The Brains Trust&quot;. 
In 1946 he was one of the BBC radio commentary team for the Tests between England and India. In 1953 he gave a 3-hour interview to the BBC which was edited down to 30 minutes for the programme &quot;Frankly Speaking&quot;. In 1955, he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews for the fifth episode of the new television show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Amongst the friends gathered to relive his best moments were Jack Hobbs and Sydney Barnes.

==Later life==
In the 1920s, Fry&#x27;s mental health started to deteriorate severely. He had encountered mental health problems earlier in his life, experiencing a breakdown during his final year at Oxford, which meant that, although academically brilliant, he achieved a poor degree. In the late 1920s, he had a major breakdown and became deeply paranoid. He reached breaking point in 1928 during a visit to India, becoming convinced that an Indian had cast a spell on him. For the rest of his life, he dressed in bizarrely unconventional clothes. He recovered enough to become a popular writer on cricket and other sports, and even into his sixties he entertained hopes of becoming a Hollywood star. At one point when he was staying in Brighton he was supposed to have gone for a walk along the beach early in the morning and suddenly shed all his clothes, trotting around stark naked.

In 1934, as reported in his 1939 autobiography, &quot;Life Worth Living&quot;, he visited Germany with the idea of forging stronger links between the uniformed British youth organisations, such as the Boy Scouts, and the Hitler Youth, so that both groups could learn from each other. Fry met Adolf Hitler who greeted him with a Nazi salute which he returned with a Nazi salute of his own. He failed to persuade von Ribbentrop that Nazi Germany should take up cricket to Test level. Some members of the Hitler Youth were welcomed at TS &quot;Mercury&quot;, and Fry was still enthusiastic about them in 1938, just prior to the outbreak of war. Fry&#x27;s laudatory statements about Hitler persisted through his autobiography&#x27;s third impression in July 1941 but appear to have been purged in the fourth impression (1947).

He retired from his position at TS &quot;Mercury&quot; in 1950, and died in 1956, in Hampstead, London. The English writer and critic Neville Cardus wrote the following words for Fry&#x27;s obituary: Fry must be counted among the most fully developed and representative Englishmen of his period; and the question arises whether, had fortune allowed him to concentrate on the things of the mind, not distracted by the lure of cricket, a lure intensified by his increasing mastery over the game, he would not have reached a high altitude in politics or critical literature. But he belonged – and it was his glory – to an age not obsessed by specialism; he was one of the last of the English tradition of the amateur, the connoisseur, and, in the most delightful sense of the word, the .

His ashes were buried in the graveyard of Repton Parish Church, next to Repton School&#x27;s Priory. In 2008, his grandson, Jonathan Fry (chairman of the governors at Repton), was in attendance at the rededication of Fry&#x27;s grave, which was inscribed with, &quot;1872 C B Fry 1956. Cricketer, scholar, athlete, Author – The Ultimate All-rounder&#x27;.

==Honours==

<doc id="571928" wikidata="Q1134602" url="?curid=571928" title="Drakes Bay">
<text>Drakes Bay (Coast Miwok: &quot;Tamál-Húye&quot;) is a wide bay named so by U.S. surveyor George Davidson in 1875 along the Point Reyes National Seashore on the coast of northern California in the United States, approximately northwest of San Francisco at approximately 38 degrees north latitude. The bay is approximately wide. It is formed on the lee side of the coastal current by Point Reyes. The bay is named after Sir Francis Drake and has long been considered Drake&#x27;s most likely landing spot on the west coast of North America during his circumnavigation of the world by sea in 1579. An alternative name for this bay is Puerto De Los Reyes.

The bay is fed by Drake&#x27;s Estero, an expansive estuary on the Point Reyes peninsula. The estuary is protected by Estero de Limantour State Marine Reserve &amp; Drakes Estero State Marine Conservation Area. Point Reyes State Marine Reserve &amp; Point Reyes State Marine Conservation Area lie within Drakes Bay. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

A portion of the coastal area of Drakes Bay is archaeologically and historically important. It is believed to be the site of Francis Drake&#x27;s 1579 landfall (which he called New Albion), and also the location where a Spanish Manila galleon sank during a storm in 1595. Both Drake and the Portuguese commander of the galleon, Sebastião Rodrigues Soromenho, interacted with the local Coast Miwok. There are fifteen archaeological sites on the bay of Miwok settlements where European trade goods have been found, including materials that the Miwok probably recovered from the wrecked galleon. The region was designated a National Historic Landmark District on October 17, 2012.

<doc id="571932" wikidata="Q7784728" url="?curid=571932" title="Third-country economic relationships with the European Union">
<text>The European Union has a number of relationships with foreign states. According to the European Union&#x27;s official site, and a statement by Commissioner Günter Verheugen, the aim is to have a ring of countries, sharing EU&#x27;s democratic ideals and joining them in further integration without necessarily becoming full member states.

== EFTA and EEA ==
The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) was created to allow European countries to partake in a free trade area with less integration as within the European Communities (later European Union). Most of the countries initially in EFTA have since joined the EU itself, so only four remain outside, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.

The European Economic Area (EEA) agreement allows Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein to have access to the EU&#x27;s internal market and vice versa. The four basic freedoms (goods, services, people, and capital) apply. However, some restrictions on fisheries and agriculture take place.

=== Norway ===

Norway is a member of the EEA, therefore it participates in the single market, and most EU laws are made part of Norwegian law. Norway has signed the Schengen treaty, which means border checks are no longer made.

=== Iceland ===

Like Norway, Iceland joined the EEA, and is considered part of the European Single Market. Iceland has also signed the Schengen treaty. In 2009 Iceland applied to join the Union but the application was controversial and the Icelandic government withdrew it in 2015.

=== Liechtenstein ===

Liechtenstein joined the EEA in 1995 and participates in the European Single Market.

=== Switzerland ===

The Swiss referendum to join the EEA in 1992 failed, so Swiss products do not participate in the European Single Market. However the country negotiated two series of bilateral agreements with the Union. The first series, Bilateral Agreements I, consists of seven bilateral agreements and was signed in 1999 (entry into force in 2001), the main part being Free Movement of Persons (full text of the agreement). The second series, Bilateral Agreements II, relates to nine areas and was signed in 2004 (entered into full force on 30 March 2005) and includes the Schengen treaty and the Dublin Convention (full text of the agreement) (official press release).

== Eurozone-related ==

There are four European microstates which are neither EU member-states nor full eurozone members, but nevertheless use and mint the euro as their legal currency under official agreements with the EU. All of them previously used the national currencies of their larger neighbours, Italy, France and Spain, which have since all become eurozone-members.

* : San Marino is not a member state of the EU, but had a special agreement with Italy to mint a limited number of its own lira coins. There is an agreement to mint its own euro coins (limited) which are legal tender in the eurozone.
* : The Vatican City is not part of the EU, but had a special agreement with Italy to mint a limited number of its own lira coins. There is an agreement to mint its own euro coins (limited) which are legal tender in the eurozone.
* : Monaco is not a member state of the EU, it had a special agreement with France to mint its own franc coins. There is an agreement to mint its own euro coins (limited), which are legal tender in the eurozone.
* : Andorra is not part of the EU. In the 20th century, both the French franc and Spanish peseta were used and accepted in Andorra, but the peseta was more widespread There is an agreement to mint its own euro coins (limited) which are legal tender in the eurozone.

In addition, two dependent territories outside of the EU use the euro as their currency under agreements with the EU, though without minting their own euro coins:
* is not a part of the EU, but there is an agreement with the EU to use euro as its currency, though without minting own euro coins. The French franc was used there before.
* is not a part of the EU, but there is an agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU to use euro as its currency, though without minting own euro coins. The Cypriot pound was used there before.

Some other countries unilaterally decided to use the euro as their de facto currency without having currently a formal agreement with the EU.

==Customs unions==
Certain countries and territories are in customs union with the EU. These are:
*: relations between the Principality of Monaco and the EU are primarily conducted through France. Through that relationship Monaco directly participates in certain EU policies, including being an integral part of the EU customs territory and VAT area.
* (excluding agricultural products; since 1996)
* (excluding agricultural products; since 1991)
* (signed in 1991 and in force since 2002)
* are partially part of the European Union Customs Union in three domains: VAT, agriculture and fisheries.

==European Union free trade agreements==
The EU has concluded free trade agreements with many countries in the world, and is negotiating with more through the Stabilisation and Association Process, Eastern Partnership, Association Agreements and Economic Partnership Agreements.

== European Neighbourhood Policy ==

&quot;Covers Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Palestinian Authority, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Russia (through the formation of common spaces).&quot;

According to the European Union&#x27;s official site, the objective of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is to share the benefits of the EU&#x27;s 2004 enlargement with neighbouring countries. It is also designed to prevent the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its neighbours. The vision is that of a ring of countries, drawn into further integration, but without necessarily becoming full members of the European Union. The policy was first outlined by the European Commission in March 2003. The countries covered include all of the Mediterranean shores of Africa and Asia, as well as the European CIS states (with the exception of Russia and Kazakhstan) in the Caucasus and eastern Europe. Russia insisted on the creation of the four EU–Russia Common Spaces instead of ENP participation. Kazakhstan&#x27;s Foreign Ministry has expressed interest in the ENP . Some MEPs also discussed Kazakhstan&#x27;s inclusion in the ENP.

The European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI), came into force in 2014. It is the financial arm of the European Neighbourhood Policy, the EU&#x27;s foreign policy towards its neighbours to the East and to the South. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.
The ENI, effective from 2014 to 2020, replaces the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument – known as the ENPI.

The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership or Barcelona Process is a wide framework of political, economic and social relations between member states of the EU and countries of the Southern Mediterranean. It was initiated on 27–28 November 1995 through a conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, held in Barcelona. Besides the 27 member states of the European Union, the remaining &quot;Mediterranean Partners&quot; are all other Mediterranean countries without Libya (which has had &#x27;observer status&#x27; since 1999). Since the establishment of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument in 2007 (see below) the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership initiative will become fully a part of the wider European Neighbourhood Policy. The Association Agreements signed with the Mediterranean states aim at establishing of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area.

== Financial cooperation and assistance programmes ==

=== For the 2000–2006 budgetary period ===

==== CARDS programme ====
CARDS, short for &quot;Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation&quot;, was established on 5 December 2000 through Council regulation Number 2666/2000.

Its scope is the Western Balkans countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia). The programme&#x27;s wider objective is to support those nations in the Stabilisation and Association Process.

==== TACIS programme ====
The TACIS programme, established in 1991, was a programme of technical assistance that supports the process of transition to market economies for the 11 CIS countries and Georgia. Until 2003, Mongolia was also included in the programme but is now covered by the ALA programme.

==== MEDA programme ====
The MEDA programme was the principal financial instrument for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, offering technical and financial support measures to accompany the reform of economic and social structures in the Mediterranean partner countries.

The first MEDA programme was established for the period of 1995–1999. In November 2000, a new regulation established MEDA II for the period of 2000–2006.

==== ACP programme ====

ACP stands for &quot;Africa, Caribbean and Pacific&quot;. The programme applies to 71 countries, among which are all African nations with the exception of the Mediterranean countries of northern Africa (covered by the MEDA programme above). The ACP is currently covered by the Cotonou Agreement, which replaces the Lomé Convention.

&quot;External links:&quot; ACP Countries at official EU site

==== ALA programme ====
ALA, standing for &quot;Asia and Latin America&quot; is a programme for financial aid and cooperation with those regions.

=== For the 2007–2013 budgetary period ===
* ENPI, standing for &quot;European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument&quot;. This is a financial instrument that covers the ENP countries. Russia is also covered by ENPI (it chose not to participate in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and opted for the formally different, but practically similar EU–Russia Common Spaces. Because of this is the &quot;Partnership&quot; part of ENPI). ENPI therefore merges the former MEDA (as all of its current beneficiaries are ENP states) and the European part of the former TACIS structure. The ENPI Info Centre was launched in January 2009 by the European Commission to highlight the relationship between the EU and its Neighbours.
* The Pre Accession Instrument replaces the former Enlargement programmes Phare, SAPARD and ISPA and CARDS (current CARDS beneficent states were moved to the Enlargement policy segment as &quot;potential candidate countries&quot;).
* The Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument covers all countries, territories and regions that are not eligible for assistance under either the PAI or ENPI (Asia, including Central Asia, Latin America, Africa, Caribbean and Pacific). Thus it will replace ALA, ACP and the rest of TACIS.
* Horizontal instruments, that cover countries regardless of their region, are:
** the Instrument for Stability, a new instrument to tackle crises and instability in third countries and address trans-border challenges including nuclear safety and non-proliferation, the fight against trafficking, organised crime and terrorism.
** Food aid is added to the Humanitarian Aid instrument.
** the Macro Financial Assistance will remain unchanged.

==Economic variation==
Below is a table and three graphs showing, respectively, the GDP (PPP), the GDP (PPP) per capita and the GDP (nominal) per capita for some of the third countries that the European Union has relations with. This can be used as a rough gauge to the relative standards of living among member states.

The table is sorted by GDP (PPP) per capita to show the relative economic development level of the different countries. Reference values for the EU average, highest and lowest are included.

<text>Cottontail rabbits are in the Sylvilagus genus, which is in the Leporidae family. They are found in the Americas. Most &quot;Sylvilagus&quot; species have stub tails with white undersides that show when they retreat, giving them their characteristic name. However, this feature is not present in all &quot;Sylvilagus&quot;, nor is it unique to the genus.

The genus is widely distributed across North America, Central America, and northern and central South America, though most species are confined to some particular regions. Most species live in nests called forms, and all have altricial young. An adult female averages three litters per year, which can occur in any season. Occurrence and litter size depend on several factors, including time of the year, weather, and location. The average litter size is four, but can range from as few as two to as many as eight, most of whom do not go on to survive to adulthood.

Cottontail rabbits show a greater resistance to myxomatosis than European rabbits.

== Evolution ==
Cottontails are one of several species of &quot;Sylvilagus&quot;. Their closest relative is &quot;Brachylagus&quot;, the pygmy rabbit. They are more distantly related to the European and other rabbits, and more distantly still to the hares. The cladogram is based on mitochondrial gene analysis.

== Lifespan ==

The lifespan of a cottontail averages about two years, depending on the location. Almost every living carnivorous creature comparable to or larger in size than these lagomorphs is a potential predator, including such diverse creatures as domestic dogs, cats, humans, snakes, coyotes, mountain lions, foxes, and if the cottontail is showing signs of illness, even squirrels. The cottontail&#x27;s most frequent predators are various birds of prey. Cottontails can also be parasitized by botfly species including &quot;Cuterebra fontinella&quot;. Newborn cottontails are particularly vulnerable to these attacks. Cottontails use burrows vacated by other animals, and the burrows are used for long enough periods that predators can learn where the cottontails reside and repeatedly return to prey on the lagomorphs. Though cottontails are prolific animals that can have multiple litters in a year, few of the resulting offspring survive to adulthood. Those that do survive grow very quickly and are full grown adults at three months.

== Eating mechanics ==
In contrast to rodents (squirrels, etc.), which generally sit on their hind legs and hold food with their front paws while feeding, cottontail rabbits eat while on all fours. Cottontail rabbits typically only use their nose to move and adjust the position of the food that it places directly in front of its front paws on the ground. The cottontail will turn the food with its nose to find the cleanest part of the vegetation (free of sand and inedible parts) to begin its meal. The only time a cottontail uses its front paws while feeding is when vegetation is above its head on a living plant, at which point the cottontail will lift its paw to bend the branch to bring the food within reach.

Cottontails are rarely found foraging for food on windy days, because the wind interferes with their hearing capabilities. Hearing an incoming predator before they get close enough to attack is their primary defense mechanism.

== Species ==
The subgenera were described in the 19th century based on limited morphological data that have been shown to not be of great use, nor to depict phylogenetic relationships. Molecular studies (limited in scope to the mitochondrial 12S gene) have shown that the currently accepted subgeneric structure, while of some heuristic value, is unlikely to withstand additional scrutiny.

<doc id="571934" wikidata="Q1248368" url="?curid=571934" title="Dawlish">
<text>Dawlish is a seaside resort town and civil parish in the Teignbridge district in Devon, England. It is located on the south coast of England at a distance of from the city of Exeter and a similar distance from the town of Torquay. At the 2021 census, it had a population of 15,257, which was 16% more than the 13,161 recorded at the 2011 census. Dawlish had grown in the 18th century from a small fishing port into a seaside resort, as had its near neighbour, Teignmouth, in the 19th century.

==Description==

Dawlish is located at the outlet of a small river, Dawlish Water (also called The Brook), between Permian red sandstone cliffs, and is fronted by a sandy beach with the South Devon Railway sea wall and the Riviera Line railway above. Behind this is a central public park, The Lawn, through which Dawlish Water flows.

Immediately to the south-west of Dawlish is a headland, Lea Mount, with Boat Cove at its foot and Coryton Cove, the furthest part of the beach accessible by the seawall path behind it. There is an Italian food kiosk there. To the north-east, via the beach or seawall, the coast can be followed for some 2 km to Langstone Rock and the resort of Dawlish Warren beyond.

Dawlish is also known for its black swans (&quot;Cygnus atratus&quot;), introduced from Western Australia, which live with other exotic waterfowl in a small urban sanctuary on Dawlish Water. There are several attractions in and around the town, such as beaches, safari mini-golf, a waterfowl centre, a theatre, a leisure centre with a pool, a countryside park, and the Dawlish Museum.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Dawlish&quot; derives from a Welsh river name meaning &quot;black stream&quot;. There was also a Roman translation of Dolfisc, meaning &#x27;Dark river&#x27; and &#x27;The Devils Water&#x27;. It was first recorded in 1044 as &quot;Doflisc&quot;. By 1086 it was &quot;Dovles&quot;; in 1302, &quot;Dovelish&quot;; and by 1468 it had become the more recognisable &quot;Dawlisshe&quot;.

==History==
Before Dawlish itself was settled, fishermen and salt makers came down from the higher ground where they lived, to take advantage of the natural resources available on the coast hereabouts. They built salterns to produce salt and stored it in sheds nearby. The unpredictable nature of the stream, Dawlish Water, during floods is likely to have led to nearby Teignmouth being the preferred site for salt-making, and the practice stopped at Dawlish during the Anglo-Saxon period (400–1000 CE).

The earliest settlement at Dawlish grew up almost a mile away from the coast, around the area where the parish church is today. There is evidence of early settlements at Aller Farm, Smallacombe, Lidwell and at Higher and Lower Southwood, where the ground would have been fertile and not subject to flooding.

The land that includes present-day Dawlish was granted by Edward the Confessor to Leofric, later the first Bishop of Exeter, in 1044. After the Norman Conquest, Leofric gave the land to the Diocese of Exeter, which held it until it was sold, in 1802.
Little of note happened at Dawlish until the end of the 18th century, when seaside locations on the south coast started to become popular with the wealthy, mainly caused by George III making Weymouth in Dorset his summer holiday residence from 1789. In May 1795, the antiquarian and topographer John Swete spent some time in Dawlish and reported that although not long ago it had been no more than a fishing village, and the best lodging house would not cost more than half a guinea per week, it was now so fashionable that &quot;in the height of the season, not a house of the least consequence is to be hired for less than two guineas a week, and many of them rise to so high a sum as four or five.&quot;

In the first decade of the 19th century the land between the original settlement and the sea was &quot;landscaped&quot;; the stream was straightened, small waterfalls were built into it, and it was flanked by a broad lawn and rows of new houses: The Strand on the north side and Brunswick Place on the south. The layout survives remarkably unchanged today, despite severe damage from a torrent of water coming down Dawlish Water from the Haldon Hills on the night of 10 November 1810.

Also worth noting are Manor House and Brook House (both about 1800) and some of the cottages in Old Town Street surviving from the old village. Dawlish&#x27;s transformation from a fishing settlement to a watering hole for Victorian celebrities is documented at the Dawlish Museum.

===Brunel&#x27;s railway===
In 1830, Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed an atmospheric railway, which operated on a pneumatic principle, using a 15-inch iron tube. One of the pumping stations was in this town. The line ran right along the seafront, but Brunel ensured that the line was carried across the mouth of the stream on a small granite viaduct, leaving access to the beach.

The railway opened on 30 May 1846 between Exeter St Davids and Newton Abbot. The first passenger train ran in September 1847, but the project was besieged with problems mainly with the leather sealing valve, which after 12 months of use needed replacing at a cost of £25,000. South Devon Railway directors abandoned the project in favour of conventional trains.

==Literary connections==
After visiting Sidmouth in 1801, Jane Austen spent a long holiday at Dawlish in 1802, later complaining about its &quot;particularly pitiful and wretched library&quot;. She mentioned it several times in her 1811 novel &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. In Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1838–39), the protagonist inherits a small farm near Dawlish. The novelist and poet Margaret Holford died in Dawlish on 11 September 1852, aged 84. On 23 March 1818, the Romantic poet John Keats walked the three miles from Teignmouth to Dawlish to visit the Easter Monday fair and subsequently wrote a poem entitled &quot;Dawlish Fair&quot;, which details a fantasy of seducing a Devon woman.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Dawlish railway station, situated in the town centre and next to the beach, is served by two train operating companies:
* Great Western Railway operates regular half-hourly stopping trains on a route between Exmouth, Exeter and Paignton. Some inter-city services between Plymouth, Paignton and stop here, as well as some services between Cardiff, Bristol, Plymouth and .
* CrossCountry services between Manchester Piccadilly and Paignton stop here twice a day in each direction.

The line includes one of the most memorable stretches of British track for its natural environment, but at high cost; a constant battle with sea erosion makes it one of the dearest lines in the country to maintain. For example, a storm in 1974 washed away much of the station&#x27;s down platform; also, in the UK storms of January–February 2014, waves brought down the sea wall and washed away a section of line, leaving the permanent way suspended.

The 2014 storm raised questions about the vulnerability of the South Devon Railway sea wall to storm damage and proposals were made to route Plymouth-bound rail services further inland, by re-opening the disused railway line via Okehampton and Tavistock, reopening the former Teign Valley Line or reviving a 1930s GWR project to construct the Dawlish Avoiding Line. In May 2019, Network Rail began a project to improve the sea defences along the sea wall at Marine Parade, south of the station, promising a wider, more accessible walkway with seating and lighting, and greater protection from the sea; it was completed on 3 July 2023.

===Roads===
The A379 road between Exeter, Teignmouth, Torbay, Dartmouth and Plymouth runs through the town, parallel to the railway line.

===Buses===
Buses in the town are operated predominantly by Stagecoach South West. Key routes are:
* 2 from Exeter to Newton Abbot
* 22 from Dawlish Warren to Torquay
* 186, which links the town centre, hospital and Sainsbury&#x27;s to the main housing areas; this is operated by Country Bus (Newton Abbot).

==Climate==
Dawlish has a mild, oceanic climate bordering on a warm to cool Mediterranean climate, according to the Köppen climate classification, with low precipitation in the summer period and high rainfall in the winter. Often termed the &quot;English Riviera&quot; along with Teignmouth and Torbay, Dawlish rarely has snow or frost and grows outdoor subtropical plants such as palms, olives, bananas and lemons. Temperatures over 30C or under 0C are infrequent. It is one of the sunniest places in Britain, with an average of nearly 1800 hours a year. Despite more favourable conditions in the summer, the wet autumn and winter can bring copious amounts of rain, and when areas of low pressure move up the English Channel, easterly winds with dramatic storm surges and waves along the seafront.

==Local produce==
During the early and middle part of the 20th century, Dawlish became known for Devon Violets perfume. Hundreds of varieties were grown in market gardens surrounding the town. Violet escapees can be found growing wild across the area. Lately the town has become known for growing dianthus, freesias, daffodils, tomatoes and strawberries.

==Retail and employment==

Centred on The Strand, Queen Street, Brunswick Place and Park Road, Dawlish has typical retail facilities for a resort town with gift shops, cafes, a fishing tackle shop, beach/toy shops, bakeries, restaurants and pubs, haberdasheries, ice-cream shops, national chains and many independent retailers. Along Piermont Place, by Dawlish railway station and the seafront, are further ice-cream shops, a restaurant, a cafe and a sports-bar with outdoor seating areas. In recent years, a number of art, craft and antiques shops have opened. At the north-eastern end of the town there is a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket with an Argos facility and a petrol station.

The largest employment sector in the town is health and social work (23 per cent), due to a large number of care homes, followed by accommodation and food services (20 per cent).

==Religion==
The town&#x27;s places of worship:
*Hope Church (DCF)
*Dawlish Baptist Church
*Dawlish Methodist Church
*Dawlish Strand Church (United Reformed)
*St Agatha&#x27;s Church (Roman Catholic)
*St Gregory&#x27;s Church (Anglican)
*St Mark&#x27;s Church (closed in 1974 and demolished)

==Schools and education==
The primary schools in Dawlish are Gatehouse Primary School, Westcliff Primary School and Orchard Manor School. Dawlish College (formerly Dawlish Community College) in Elm Grove Road is the main secondary school. Oakwood Court College is a specialist residential college based in Dawlish, with a satellite college in Torpoint.

==Governance==
Locally, Dawlish is governed by Dawlish Town Council, which is currently controlled by the Liberal Democrats, as is the next local-government layer above, Teignbridge District Council. Dawlish lies in the parliamentary constituency of Newton Abbot and is currently represented by Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris, who retained her seat at the 2019 general election.

==Twinning==
Dawlish is twinned with the Breton commune of Carhaix-Plouguer in France.

<text>The State University of New York at Delhi (SUNY Delhi or Delhi State College) is a public college in Delhi, New York, United States. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Over 3,000 students attend the institution. 

SUNY Delhi offers over 60 programs, which can lead to certificates, associate degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, or master&#x27;s degrees. There are five academic schools within the college: Veterinary and Applied Sciences, Applied Technologies, Business and Hospitality Management, Nursing, and Liberal Arts and Sciences. The college is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

==History==
SUNY Delhi was founded on May 24, 1913, as a small agriculture school by two women, Amelia and Elizabeth MacDonald. Then known as the State School of Agriculture and Domestic Science, the college served students from all over New York. 

By the late 1920s, the fledgling agricultural college began offering more general education and added dormitory buildings. 

The school&#x27;s name changed for the first time in 1941, becoming the New York State Agricultural and Technical Institute at Delhi, one of six state agricultural schools in New York. Seven years later, the school was absorbed into the newly-established State University of New York system. 

Sixteen years after joining the SUNY system in 1948, the college changed its name for a third time, becoming the New York Agricultural and Technical College at Delhi. It was not until this period of the 1960s that the institution expanded to offer more programs of study like business, refrigeration, construction, and veterinary technology. Delhi also added several new academic buildings, more dorms, and a new dining hall.

The school changed names a fourth time in 1987, becoming the State University of New York College of Technology at Delhi.
The college began offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the early 2000s. With this change, the school adopted its current name, State University of New York at Delhi, in 2002. With this upgrade came much expansion of the campus. 

In 2018, the SUNY Delhi athletic program joined the NCAA Division III.

==Student life==
===Campus housing===
SUNY Delhi has a two-year live-in requirement with possible exceptions. To accommodate students SUNY Delhi operates six residence halls (Dubois Hall, Gerry Hall, Murphy Hall, O&#x27;Connor Hall and Russell Hall) on-campus and one townhouse complex (Riverview Townhouses) just off-campus in the village of Delhi. Student are housed by legal sex primarily in double occupancy rooms with a limited number of single occupancy rooms available primarily for upper-class standing students. Russell Hall is the largest residence hall holding nearly 500 students and is home the Veterinary Science, Nursing and LGTBQ+ Ally living learning communities. Dubois Hall and Gerry Hall are sister buildings, and hold approximately 236 and 200 students respectfully. Murphy Hall and O&#x27;Connor Hall, another set of sister building, house approximately 270 students each. O&#x27;Connor Hall houses the First-Year Experience program and accordingly houses only first-year students. Catskill Hall houses only upper-class standing students and provides suite-style housing with suites housing six students. Each suite contains a shower room and bathroom, and a living room area. The Riverview Townhouses consist of two-story townhouses housing six to eight students in a combination of double rooms and single rooms. All townhouses contain a kitchen, a living room, and two bathrooms. Laundry facilities are available in all residential facilities and are free to use, paid for by the housing fee. Student positions are available for Resident Assistants.

===Clubs and activities===
There are over forty clubs and organizations on campus, as well as sixteen recognized and several unrecognized Greek organizations. The student activities office is located in the upper level of the Farrell Student and Community Center.

===Student Senate===
The student senate meets every Wednesday at 5:15 sharp in the Farrell Student and Community Center room 211/212. Although each club or organization on campus is represented with an elected senator, any student is welcome to come to the senate meetings and voice their interest. The student senate office is located in the bottom, club office portion of Farrell, in room 32. If the officers are out of the office, further interest can be addressed in the student activities office, also located in the Farrell Student and Community Center.

==Athletics==
The SUNY Delhi athletic teams are called the Broncos. Their mascot is Blaze the Bronco. The university is a member of the NCAA Division III ranks, primarily competing in the North Atlantic Conference (NAC) since the 2019–20 academic year (for most sports, with basketball and softball following suit in 2020–21). They also competed as a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) from 2015–16 to about 2019–20. The Broncos previously competed in the short-lived D-III American Collegiate Athletic Association (ACAA) from 2017–18 to 2018–19; as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) from 2008–09 to 2016–17; and in the Mountain Valley Athletic Conference (MVAC) of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) during the 2000s until after the 2014–15 school year. Prior to 2015, the Broncos were members of the NJCAA, where they collected 21 national titles in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country and track &amp; field.

SUNY Delhi competes in 17 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

The men&#x27;s cross country earned the school&#x27;s first four-year national title when they won the 2016 USCAA Championship, and repeated as champions in 2017. That same year, the men&#x27;s golf team won the college&#x27;s first national team title outside of cross country and track &amp; field at the USCAA Championships.

===Facilities===
Kunsela Hall Aquatics Center, located in the agora on the main campus, houses the pool. This building went through renovations during the Fall 2011 semester and has since re-opened.

Clark Field house, located at the highest point on the main campus, has several features which contribute to Delhi&#x27;s athletic success. Attached to this building, the &quot;Bubble,&quot; is a dome which allows the space for indoor track and soccer practices, as well as mobile tennis nets and basketball hoops. Also in Clark Field house is the CADI Fitness Center, including traditional weight lifting options, recumbent bicycles, ellipticals, and treadmills, as well as equipment available for rent. The athletic offices are also located in this building, as well as the Floyd L. Maines Arena – often used for games, concerts, and other school functions.

There are a variety of outdoor spaces available as well, including a track, soccer field, racquetball courts, tennis courts, and basketball courts. The Delhi College Golf Course is located in the valley portion of the campus.

Farrell Student and Community Center has a dance and aerobics room on its main floor, where free yoga, pilates, and dance classes are regularly held.

<doc id="571941" wikidata="Q841408" url="?curid=571941" title="Ethnobotany">
<text>Ethnobotany is an interdisciplinary field at the interface of natural and social sciences that studies the relationships between humans and plants. It focuses on traditional knowledge of how plants are used, managed, and perceived in human societies. Ethnobotany integrates knowledge from botany, anthropology, ecology, and chemistry to study plant-related customs across cultures. Researchers in this field document and analyze how different societies use local flora for various purposes, including medicine, food, religious use, intoxicants, building materials, fuels and clothing. Richard Evans Schultes, often referred to as the &quot;father of ethnobotany&quot;, provided an early definition of the discipline:

Since Schultes&#x27; time, ethnobotany has evolved from primarily documenting traditional plant knowledge to applying this information in modern contexts, particularly in pharmaceutical development. The field now addresses complex issues such as intellectual property rights and equitable benefit-sharing arrangements arising from the use of traditional knowledge.

==History==
The idea of ethnobotany was first proposed by the early 20th century botanist John William Harshberger. While Harshberger did perform ethnobotanical research extensively, including in areas such as North Africa, Mexico, Scandinavia, and Pennsylvania, it was not until Richard Evans Schultes began his trips into the Amazon that ethnobotany became a more well known science. However, the practice of ethnobotany is thought to have much earlier origins in the first century AD when a Greek physician by the name of Pedanius Dioscorides wrote an extensive botanical text detailing the medical and culinary properties of &quot;over 600 mediterranean plants&quot; named &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;. Historians note that Dioscorides wrote about traveling often throughout the Roman empire, including regions such as &quot;Greece, Crete, Egypt, and Petra&quot;, and in doing so obtained substantial knowledge about the local plants and their useful properties. European botanical knowledge drastically expanded once the New World was discovered due to ethnobotany. This expansion in knowledge can primarily be attributed to the substantial influx of new plants from the Americas, including crops such as potatoes, peanuts, avocados, and tomatoes. The French explorer Jacques Cartier learned a cure for scurvy (a tea made from the needles of a coniferous tree, likely spruce) from a local Iroquois tribe.

==Medieval and Renaissance==
During the medieval period, ethnobotanical studies were often conducted in connection with monasticism. However, most botanical knowledge was kept in gardens, such as physic gardens attached to hospitals and religious buildings. It was thought of in practical use terms for culinary and medical purposes and the ethnographic element was not studied as a modern anthropologist might approach ethnobotany today.

==Age of Reason==
In 1732, Carl Linnaeus carried out a research expedition in Scandinavia asking the Sami people about their ethnological usage of plants.

The Age of Enlightenment saw a rise in economic botanical exploration. Alexander von Humboldt collected data from the New World, and James Cook&#x27;s voyages brought back collections and information on plants from the South Pacific. At this time major botanical gardens were started, for instance the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1759. The directors of the gardens sent out gardener-botanist explorers to care for and collect plants to add to their collections.

As the 18th century became the 19th, ethnobotany saw expeditions undertaken with more colonial aims rather than trade economics such as that of Lewis and Clarke which recorded both plants and the peoples encountered use of them. Edward Palmer collected material culture artifacts and botanical specimens from people in the North American West (Great Basin) and Mexico from the 1860s to the 1890s. Through all of this research, the field of &quot;aboriginal botany&quot; was established—the study of all forms of the vegetable world which aboriginal peoples use for food, medicine, textiles, ornaments and more.

==Development and application in modern science==
The first individual to study the emic perspective of the plant world was a German physician working in Sarajevo at the end of the 19th century: Leopold Glück. His published work on traditional medical uses of plants done by rural people in Bosnia (1896) has to be considered the first modern ethnobotanical work.
Other scholars analyzed uses of plants under an indigenous/local perspective in the 20th century: Matilda Coxe Stevenson, Zuni plants (1915); Frank Cushing, Zuni foods (1920); Keewaydinoquay Peschel, Anishinaabe fungi (1998), and the team approach of Wilfred Robbins, John Peabody Harrington, and Barbara Freire-Marreco, Tewa pueblo plants (1916).

In the beginning, ethonobotanical specimens and studies were not very reliable and sometimes not helpful. This is because the botanists and the anthropologists did not always collaborate in their work. The botanists focused on identifying species and how the plants were used instead of concentrating upon how plants fit into people&#x27;s lives. On the other hand, anthropologists were interested in the cultural role of plants and treated other scientific aspects superficially. In the early 20th century, botanists and anthropologists better collaborated and the collection of reliable, detailed cross-disciplinary data began.

Beginning in the 20th century, the field of ethnobotany experienced a shift from the raw compilation of data to a greater methodological and conceptual reorientation. This is also the beginning of academic ethnobotany. The so-called &quot;father&quot; of this discipline is Richard Evans Schultes, even though he did not actually coin the term &quot;ethnobotany&quot;. Today the field of ethnobotany requires a variety of skills: botanical training for the identification and preservation of plant specimens; anthropological training to understand the cultural concepts around the perception of plants; linguistic training, at least enough to transcribe local terms and understand native morphology, syntax, and semantics.

Mark Plotkin, who studied at Harvard University, the Yale School of Forestry and Tufts University, has contributed a number of books on ethnobotany. He completed a handbook for the Tirio people of Suriname detailing their medicinal plants; &quot;Tales of a Shaman&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1994); &quot;The Shaman&#x27;s Apprentice,&quot; a children&#x27;s book with Lynne Cherry (1998); and &quot;Medicine Quest: In Search of Nature&#x27;s Healing Secrets&quot; (2000).

Plotkin was interviewed in 1998 by &quot;South American Explorer&quot; magazine, just after the release of &quot;Tales of a Shaman&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; and the IMAX movie Amazonia. In the book, he stated that he saw wisdom in both traditional and Western forms of medicine:
No medical system has all the answers—no shaman that I&#x27;ve worked with has the equivalent of a polio vaccine and no dermatologist that I&#x27;ve been to could cure a fungal infection as effectively (and inexpensively) as some of my Amazonian mentors. It shouldn&#x27;t be the doctor versus the witch doctor. It should be the best aspects of all medical systems (ayurvedic, herbalism, homeopathic, and so on) combined in a way which makes health care more effective and more affordable for all.

A great deal of information about the traditional uses of plants is still intact with tribal peoples. But the native healers are often reluctant to accurately share their knowledge to outsiders. Schultes actually apprenticed himself to an Amazonian shaman, which involves a long-term commitment and genuine relationship. In &quot;Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing &amp; Chinese Medicine&quot; by Garcia et al. the visiting acupuncturists were able to access levels of Mayan medicine that anthropologists could not because they had something to share in exchange. Cherokee medicine priest David Winston describes how his uncle would invent nonsense to satisfy visiting anthropologists.

Another scholar, James W. Herrick, who studied under ethnologist William N. Fenton, in his work &quot;Iroquois Medical Ethnobotany&quot; (1995) with Dean R. Snow (editor), professor of Anthropology at Penn State, explains that understanding herbal medicines in traditional Iroquois cultures is rooted in a strong and ancient cosmological belief system. Their work provides perceptions and conceptions of illness and imbalances which can manifest in physical forms from benign maladies to serious diseases. It also includes a large compilation of Herrick&#x27;s field work from numerous Iroquois authorities of over 450 names, uses, and preparations of plants for various ailments. Traditional Iroquois practitioners had (and have) a sophisticated perspective on the plant world that contrast strikingly with that of modern medical science.

Researcher Cassandra Quave at Emory University has used ethnobotany to address the problems that arise from antibiotic resistance. Quave notes that the advantage of medical ethnobotany over Western medicine rests in the difference in mechanism. For example, elmleaf blackberry extract focuses instead on the prevention of bacterial collaboration as opposed to directly exterminating them.

==Issues==

Many instances of gender bias have occurred in ethnobotany, creating the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions. Anthropologists would often consult with primarily men. In Las Pavas, a small farming community in Panama, anthropologists drew conclusions about the entire community&#x27;s use of plant from their conversations and lessons with mostly men. They consulted with 40 families, but the women only participated rarely in interviews and never joined them in the field. Due to the division of labor, the knowledge of wild plants for food, medicine, and fibers, among others, was left out of the picture, resulting in a distorted view of which plants were actually important to them.

Ethnobotanists have also assumed that ownership of a resource means familiarity with that resource. In some societies women are excluded from owning land, while being the ones who work it. Inaccurate data can come from interviewing only the owners.

Other issues include ethical concerns regarding interactions with indigenous populations, and the International Society of Ethnobiology has created a code of ethics to guide researchers.

<doc id="571950" wikidata="Q302893" url="?curid=571950" title="Dereham">
<text>Dereham (), also known historically as East Dereham, is a town and civil parish in the Breckland District of the English county of Norfolk. It is situated on the A47 road, about 15 miles (25 km) west of the city of Norwich and 25 miles (40 km) east of King&#x27;s Lynn.

The civil parish has an area of and, in the 2001 census, had a population of 15,659 in 6,941 households; it increased to 18,609 by the 2011 census. Dereham falls within, and is the centre of administration for, Breckland District Council. The town should not be confused with the Norfolk village of West Dereham, which lies about 25 miles (40 km) away.

Since 1983, Dereham has been twinned with the town of Rüthen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is also twinned with Caudebec-lès-Elbeuf, France.
In spite of the reunification of Germany in 1990, until 2024, the sign on the A47 at the entrance to Dereham from the Swaffham direction still referred to Rüthen being in West Germany; this sparked periodic comment in the local press.

==History==
===Early history===
Dereham&#x27;s name derives from the Old English word &quot;deor&quot; meaning &quot;deer&quot; or &quot;wild animal&quot; with the very common &quot;-ham&quot; (&quot;village&quot;, &quot;homestead&quot;, or to denote land that is closed in by water or other geographical features), so perhaps it referred to a place where deer or other animals were kept or grazed.

According to local tradition, Saint Wihtburh (aka Withburga), claimed to be the daughter of Anna, King of the East Angles, founded a monastery there in the seventh century after seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary, although the Venerable Bede does not mention her, or her monastery, in his writings, despite reporting the story of her more famous sister Æthelthryth /Etheldreda of Ely. Apart from reference to it in the eleventh-century hagiography of Wihtburh, little is known of her foundation and no evidence survives today.

An archaeological report by Norfolk County Council indicates that the first &quot;documentary evidence&quot; of a settlement in this area is a reference in one of the versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to the exhumation of the remains of St Wihtburh in AD 798, said to be 55 years after her death. But that reference is an eleventh-century addition to the Chronicle. Nonetheless, there is evidence for an early ecclesiastical site at Dereham. The Domesday Book of 1086 states that in the eleventh century, &quot;St Etheldreda held Dereham that was already an important market centre with three mills&quot;. The report adds that the growing community was centred around St. Nicholas Church, from the Norman era; the structure was altered during the 1200s, 1300s and 1400s. Because numerous medieval buildings were destroyed in fires during 1581 and 1679, the town appears to have a Georgian aspect.

A Neolithic polished greenstone axe head was found near the town in 1986, with a Neolithic axe head, flint scraper and other tools and worked flints also found in local fields during the 1980s. There is evidence that the area was occupied during the Bronze Age, with burnt flints from a pot boiler site being found in 1976 and another burnt mound site located in 1987.

In 2000, an enamelled bridle bit dating from the Iron Age was discovered, with pottery sherds also being found by field walkers in 1983. The town is believed to be on the Roman Road linking the Brampton with the major east-west Roman Road of the Fen Causeway. Some pottery and furniture remains have been found in local fields.

In 2004, the largest number of Roman coins found in Norfolk was discovered in Dereham, over 1000 from the third century. A dig provided no evidence of Roman occupation, however.

Edmund Bonner, later to become the infamous &#x27;burning bishop&#x27;, was the Rector for Dereham from 1534 to 1538. Many of the town&#x27;s ancient buildings were destroyed in the serious fires that took place in 1581 and 1659. Notable buildings that survived the fire include the Church of Saint Nicholas and the nearby Bishop Bonner&#x27;s cottage. Dereham was administered by the Abbots, then the Bishops of Ely, until the parish was taken from the church by Queen Elizabeth I.

===Napoleonic conflict===
In the late 1700s, Dereham church&#x27;s bell tower was used as a prison for French prisoners of war being transferred from Great Yarmouth to Norman Cross under the charge of the East Norfolk Militia. On 6 October 1799, a French officer, Jean de Narde, managed to escape from the tower and, being unable to escape from the church yard due to guards being present, hid in a tree. The Frenchman was spotted and shot when he refused to come down and surrender. Jean is buried in the churchyard and his grave is marked by a memorial stone erected in 1858, which includes the following statement: &quot;Once our foes but now our allies and brethren.&quot; This story is told in the documentary, &quot;The Shooting of Jean DeNarde&quot;. Jean de Narde&#x27;s link with Dereham is commemorated by a road named for him just off the B1146 as one approaches the town from the north.

One of the windmills built during this era, the Grade II Listed East Dereham Windmill (built in 1836) was known as the Norwich Road Mill or Fendick&#x27;s Mill; it was constructed by James Hardy for Michael Hardy who owned a smock mill at Bittering. The windmill continued to use wind power until 1922 when it was converted to use engine power. The facility closed in 1937. It was restored and reopened as an exhibition centre in 2013.

==== Dereham Rifle Volunteer Corps ====
In June 1859, a public meeting was held at the Corn Exchange for the formation of a Dereham Rifle Volunteer Corps. The Reverend Armstrong made a short speech urging people to join; around thirty men did, the eldest was an elderly fat banker of 70 years and the youngest a seventeen-year-old. They were kitted out in a grey uniform. The Corps met regularly for drill and exercise. When the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Queen of Denmark arrived at the town&#x27;s railway station, the Dereham Rifles attended to form a guard of honour.

William Earle G. Lytton Bulwer, formerly a lieutenant and captain in the Scots Fusilier Guards, was commanding the Dereham Corps in 1861. Dereham became the headquarters of 1st Administrative Battalion, Norfolk Rifle Volunteers in 1866. The Quebec Street drill hall opened that year, and the Right Hon. Lord Suffield was appointed Honorary Colonel on 18 May 1866.

===First World War===
At the outbreak of war, the 5th Battalion, Norfolk Regiment, kept their HQ in Quebec Street but were based in the Corn Exchange, and used the Masonic Hall on Norwich Road as a store, with the Assembly Rooms being used for medical inspections.

Dereham suffered damage during a Zeppelin air raid during the night of 8 September 1915. Damaged buildings included the headquarters of the 5th Norfolk Regiment at their premises on the corner of Church Street and Quebec Street. The raid also hit The White Lion public house on Church Street, seriously injuring two customers. The roof was destroyed and The White Lion never reopened as a public house. The old Vicarage was used as a Red Cross hospital.

In December 1915, Zeppelin L14 dropped bombs between Bylaugh Park and Dereham. Seventy-five bombs were dropped on Dereham, with several houses destroyed and eight or nine bombs dropped onto the Red Cross hospital established in the vicarage, although these failed to detonate. Another bomb hit the guildhall and destroyed windows in the church. Four people were killed and six injured during the raid, with the coroner&#x27;s report stating that the deaths were caused by bombs &quot;unlawfully dropped from a Zeppelin aircraft.&quot;

===World War II===
Dereham was declared a Nodal Point during the Second World War and was partially fortified to slow down any German invasion of the country. Several defensive structures were built. One surviving pill box, in the railway station yard, is preserved as a memorial by the Royal British Legion; several others were built but are no longer visible. Additional Air Ministry sidings were laid in the town in 1943.

A Cold War-era bunker was built underground near the Guild Hall.

===1969 Phantom air incident===
On 25 March 1969 a USAF McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II (F4-C) suffered a flight control system failure at 15,000 ft. The flight controls were now jammed, and the aircraft entered a steep dive.

The WSO, Captain Mike Hinnebusch, ejected at 5,000 ft, but the pilot ejected later, when the aircraft was now at supersonic speed. The pilot&#x27;s parachute opened two seconds before the aircraft hit the ground. The pilot, Captain Kristian Michael Mineau, born 26 November 1941, survived but the supersonic ejection caused all of his four limbs to be shattered. Supersonic ejection is not always survivable. The pilot was taken by helicopter to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, and the less-injured WSO was taken by ambulance to the hospital.

The aircraft was from the 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron at RAF Bentwaters. The aircraft caused a 50 ft deep crater, with some components being found at 75 feet depth.

===Railways===

The railway arrived in Dereham in 1847, when a single track line to opened. A second line was opened, in 1848, to . A line from Dereham to Fakenham was opened in 1849; this line being extended to the coastal town of Wells-next-the-Sea by 1857. The town&#x27;s railways became part of the Great Eastern Railway in 1862. Dereham had its own railway depot and a large complex of sidings, serving local industry. The line between Dereham and Wymondham was doubled, in 1882, to allow for the increasing levels of traffic.

Passenger services between Dereham and Wells were withdrawn in 1964 and the track between Fakenham and Wells was lifted soon after. The line from Dereham to Wymondham was returned to single track in 1965, with a passing loop at . The line to King&#x27;s Lynn was closed in 1968 and the last passenger train on the Dereham-to-Wymondham line ran in 1969, although the railway remained open for freight until 1989.

Dereham labels itself &quot;The Heart of Norfolk&quot; owing to its central location in the county, the Tesco car park being cited as the exact centre. In the spring of 1978, the &quot;Heart&quot; was given the seven-mile £5m part-dual-carriageway A47 bypass. A section of this road, between Scarning and Wendling, was built along the former railway line towards Swaffham and King&#x27;s Lynn. This section of railway had been used as a location for the filming of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, where Captain Mainwaring is left dangling from a railway bridge after a flight on a barrage balloon. Dereham railway station was also a filming location for the opening scene of the BBC&#x27;s 2018 series &quot;Bodyguard&quot;.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The A47 trunk road from Lowestoft to Birmingham once ran through the centre of the town, east to west. The A47 was re-routed in 1978 to form a seven mile (11.3 km) £5 million East Dereham by-pass, consisting of a section of dual carriageway approaching Dereham from the east, and to the west a single carriageway built on the disused railway line to King&#x27;s Lynn, by-passing the villages of Wendling and Scarning. Three other significant roads intersect at Dereham; the B1146 connects the town northwards to Fakenham, the A1075 connects it to Watton and Thetford to the south-west, and the B1135 runs south-east to Wymondham.

===Cycling===
National Cycle Route 13 runs through Dereham, joining with National Cycle Route 1 north of the town.

===Buses===
Frequent bus services operate from Dereham to Norwich and Peterborough; less frequent services are provided for several local villages. Dereham does not have a bus station, with most services operating through the marketplace.

===Railway===
Dereham is not currently served by National Rail services. The nearest station is , which is on the Breckland line between and .

====Heritage railway====
There is presently no regular service between Dereham and Norwich, but the section of railway between Wymondham, Dereham and , described earlier in the History section, has been preserved and is now operated between Wymondham and Worthing as a tourist line by the Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust. This charitable company is gradually reopening the line through North Elmham and supports the restoration of the line to Fakenham. As well as running heritage trains, the MNR also runs special attractions such as the Polar Express Train Ride every winter and operate non-passenger services in support of mainline companies.

Although no scheduled services operate between Dereham and the rest of the national network, in June 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a document (Connecting Communities: Expanding Access to the Rail Network) calling for the restoration of services on a variety of former branch lines, including the Dereham branch. This £30m proposal would see regular services restored between Dereham and Norwich, operated subject to agreement with the Mid-Norfolk Railway Preservation Trust.

In 2020, the railway announced that they had, in association with partner organisations including Greater Anglia, Norfolk County Council, Breckland District Council and the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership, bid for funding for a feasibility study into reopening the line for regular commuter services over their route. The plans to restore the line, and potentially extend it to Fakenham in time, have been backed by the George Freeman, MP for Mid-Norfolk. In June 2021, an unsuccessful funding bid was submitted as part of the second round of the Restoring Your Railway fund. A bid was re-submitted for the third round

==Saint Withburga&#x27;s Well==

The town lies on the site of a monastery said by local tradition to have been founded by Saint Withburga in the seventh century; the saint died in 743AD. A holy well is at the western end of St Nicholas Church yard and the tradition claims this to have begun to flow when her body was stolen from the town by monks from Ely, who took the remains back to their town.

An attempt was made in 1752 to turn Dereham into a new Buxton or Bath by building a bathhouse over Withburga&#x27;s Well. It was described at the time as a &quot;hideous building of brick and plaster&quot; and was never popular. The building was extensively modified in 1793 according to a book published in 1856.

The local vicar, Reverend Benjamin Armstrong, obtained permission in 1880 to pull the building down. The spring was then protected by iron railings but fell out of use and became choked with weeds. Since 1950, however, it has been kept clear of weeds, although the railings still prevent access to the waters. In a 2006 report on the church, Simon Knott indicated that by then, the &quot;well&quot; was actually a &quot;sunken spring&quot;.

Today, the Church of England refers to St Nicholas Church as &quot;Founded by St Withburga AD654&quot;, presumably because it may be on the same site as the monastery and convent she was said to have founded. The church has been a Grade I listed structure since 1951 (Entry #1077067).

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Dereham, at parish (town), district and county level: Dereham Town Council, Breckland District Council and Norfolk County Council. The town council is responsible for matters such as play areas, allotments, cemeteries and markets. Its assets include Dereham Memorial Hall, Neatherd Moor, Bishop Bonners Cottage, two cemeteries and six allotment sites. The town council is based at the Assembly Rooms on Rüthen Place in the town centre.

The district council also has its headquarters in Dereham, at Elizabeth House on Walpole Loke on the outskirts of the town.

East Dereham was an ancient parish. Until 1877 it was governed by its vestry in the same way as most rural areas. In 1877 the parish was made a local government district, governed by a local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894.

East Dereham Urban District was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the new Breckland District. A successor parish was established covering the former urban district. The parish was formally renamed from East Dereham to just Dereham with effect from 24 June 1991.

==Industry and employment==

Dereham was the home to the &quot;Jentique&quot; furniture factory which made boxes for both instruments and bombs during the Second World War. The town was also the home to the Metamec clock factory.

Hobbies of Dereham produced plans, kits and tools—including their famous treadle fretwork saws—for making wooden models and toys, which were popular in the days before moulded plastic. At one point, Hobbies owned ten shops in prestige locations all over the UK. In the early 1960s the firm was taken over by Great Universal Stores, who sold the shops and closed the business. However, due to a shrewd management purchase of the &quot;old traditional&quot; parts of the firm, Hobbies rose again, limiting itself to the role of specialist model-makers shop. After nearly 40 years of its new lease of life, Hobbies moved out of Dereham to new premises elsewhere in Norfolk at Raveningham, where it still trades today.

Cranes of Dereham, and its successor the Fruehauf trailer company, was a major employer in the town for many decades. Cranes built nearly all the giant trailers (100 tons plus) that carried equipment such as transformers at slow speeds across the UK, usually in the livery of Wynns or Pickfords. The launch of a new trailer was treated rather like that of a ship with many people coming out to see the leviathan move through the narrow streets of the town towards the A47. The town also had several large maltings. Almost all this large-scale industry has drifted away since the 1980s.

In March 2015, Crisp Maltings announced that they intended to restore the maltings complex beside the station to operational condition, producing malt for craft beer, as part of a planning application for a major housing development. The restoration was expected to cost £1 million. In 2017, the plan to restore the Maltings was dropped, although the housing development was allowed to continue. As of 2020 the Maltings buildings have been made weathertight but they remain empty.

Companies currently based in Dereham include Flagship Housing and Zip Industries.

==Economy==
Dereham is a busy market town serving local residents and a wide rural area. The town has a market on Tuesdays and Fridays selling a range of food and household items. The town&#x27;s shops are a mixture of local independent businesses and national chains. The Market Place and the High Street were the traditional shopping areas but in 2005 a new shopping area was created called Wright&#x27;s Walk which is mainly occupied by national chains.

A second phase of development at Wright&#x27;s Walk was envisaged but this has never been started. Instead, the land earmarked for this development has been used to create a pocket park offering a tranquil public meeting space, a community garden and a performance area. Funding for the park came from a £15,000 grant from the Pocket Park Fund - part of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and an equal sum from Breckland Council.
==Sport and leisure==
An area of former railway and industrial land, close to the town&#x27;s station, now serves as the location for a number of sports and leisure facilities. The Dereham Leisure Centre, built on the old railway locomotive depot, has a swimming pool, gym, dance and sports facilities. Open air tennis courts, children&#x27;s play equipment and a skate park are provided on the nearby Dereham recreation ground. Strikes also operate a ten-pin bowling alley on the site.

Dereham has a non-League football club, Dereham Town, who play at Aldiss Park. As of the 2024–25 season, the team plays in the Eastern Counties League Premier Division.

Dereham Town FC run the Dereham Education and Soccer Academy (DESA), a partnership between Northgate High School Sixth Form College and the football club. The programme allows students to follow a Level 3 BTEC in Sport, alongside A levels and/or GCSE Maths and English retakes while also being part of a football academy. Graduates of DESA include Colchester United midfielder Luke Hannant and Swindon Town left-back Frazer Blake-Tracy.

Dereham Rugby Club, based on Moorgate Road, play in the Woodfordes League.

Dereham Cricket Club was formed in 1856. It plays home games at its ground on Norwich Road. Dereham Hockey Club is based nearby on Greenfield Road.

In August each year, Dereham hosts a 5K race on a two-lap course around the town, which is organised by Dereham Runners. The first race was held in 2011.

Dereham featured on the 2012 Tour of Britain cycle race route during the first stage from Ipswich to the Norfolk Showground. The race entered the town from the Swanton Morley direction passing along Theatre Street, the Market Place and Norwich Street, before leaving town via Norwich Road and heading towards Mattishall.

A footpath from the town links with the &quot;Wensum Way&quot; at Gressenhall. This links to the Marriott&#x27;s Way long-distance path to Norwich and Wroxham, and the &quot;Nar Valley Way&quot; to King&#x27;s Lynn.

Neatherd Moor is an Urban Greenspace to the north-east of the town. It was designated as a County Wildlife Site in 2013.
Historically, the moor was used for grazing and sourcing raw materials until the early 1800s. Today it is used by walkers and joggers and has a modern children&#x27;s play area.

A further large open space is Dereham Rush Meadow, a 22.2-hectare (55-acre) biological &quot;Site of Special Scientific Interest&quot; to the north-west of the town.

In 2005, Dereham gained a new £2,000,000 library. The building is spread over two floors and features a sedum roof over a single storey area of the ground floor. The library is the second most used in Norfolk, after the Millennium Library in Norwich.

Dereham has a three-screen cinema housed in the former Corn Exchange building. The building also hosts a nightclub called Metro. The building has had many incarnations including as a music venue in the 1960s when a range of top bands played there. These included Small Faces, Cream, Pink Floyd, The Jeff Beck Group and The Jimi Hendrix Experience.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Tacolneston TV transmitter.

Dereham&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Norfolk, Heart East and Greatest Hits Radio East (formerly Radio Norwich 99.9).

The Dereham Times is the town&#x27;s weekly local newspaper including the regional newspaper Eastern Daily Press.

<text>The Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO ) is an American auto insurance company headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. In addition to auto insurance, GEICO provides motorcycle, ATV, RV, boat, snowmobile, travel, pet, event, homeowner, renter, and jewelry insurance options. It is the second largest auto insurer in the United States, after State Farm. GEICO is a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, which provides coverage for more than 24 million motor vehicles owned by more than 15 million policy holders as of 2017. GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. The insurance agency sells policies through local agents, called GEICO Field Representatives, over the phone directly to the consumer via licensed insurance agents, and through their website. Its mascot is a gold dust day gecko with a Cockney accent, voiced by the English actor Jake Wood. GEICO is well known in popular culture for its advertising.

Despite the presence of the word &quot;government&quot; in its name, GEICO has always been a private corporation and not a government agency or a government-owned corporation. Leo Goodwin Sr. and his wife Lillian Goodwin originally founded the company in 1936 to sell auto insurance to federal government employees.

GEICO manages the policies as the &quot;insurance agent&quot; and has a separate customer care team that handles the property and umbrella policies.

==History==
GEICO was founded in 1936 by Leo Goodwin Sr. and his wife Lillian Goodwin to provide auto insurance directly to federal government employees and their families. Since 1925, Goodwin had worked for USAA, an insurer that specialized in insuring only military personnel. He decided to start his own company after rising as far as a civilian could go in USAA&#x27;s military-dominated hierarchy. The Goodwins funded the creation of GEICO with $25,000 of their own money and $75,000 from Fort Worth, Texas-based banker Cleaves Rhea, with legal assistance from future GEICO CEO Lorimer Davidson. Based on Goodwin&#x27;s experience at USAA, GEICO&#x27;s original business model was predicated on the assumption that federal employees, as a group, would constitute a less risky and more financially stable pool of insureds compared to the general public.

In 1937, the Goodwins relocated GEICO from San Antonio, Texas, to Washington, D.C., and reincorporated the company as a D.C. corporation after realizing that their business model would work best in the place with the highest concentration of federal employees.

In 1948, the Rhea family sold its 75% stake of GEICO to a coalition of investors, which was led by Benjamin Graham&#x27;s Graham-Newman Partnership taking 50% (worth $712,000 at the time); this sale accidentally violated a SEC regulation, which forced Graham-Newman to divest a portion of their holdings in 1949, resulting in GEICO becoming a publicly traded company at ~$27/sh. Graham-Newman&#x27;s investment in GEICO eventually resulted in a position worth $400 million by 1972, which was by far Graham-Newman&#x27;s best investment and outperformed the rest of their portfolio combined.

In 1951, Warren Buffett, then a Columbia University graduate student under Benjamin Graham, interviewed Lorimer Davidson (then a VP) and named GEICO &quot;The Security I Like Best.&quot; From 1948 to 1958, GEICO&#x27;s market capitalization grew almost 50 times.

In 1958, Goodwin retired and was succeeded by Lorimer Davidson, who grew the company&#x27;s insurance premiums at a compound rate of 16% annually from $40 million to $250 million over his tenure. Davidson retired and was replaced in 1970 by Ralph Peck (President and COO) and David Lloyd Kreeger (Chairman and CEO), who had been one of the other investors in 1948.

In 1974 under Kreeger&#x27;s leadership, GEICO began to insure the general public after real-time access to computerized driving records became available throughout the United States. At this time, GEICO was briefly the fifth-largest U.S. auto insurer. By 1975, it was clear that GEICO had expanded far too rapidly (during the 1973–75 recession) when it reported a US$126.5 million loss. Kreeger retired in 1975, although he continued in his role as chairman of the executive committee until 1979 when he was named honorary chairman, and Peck left in 1976 after GEICO&#x27;s share price had fallen from $42 to $5. To prevent GEICO from collapsing, a consortium of 45 insurance companies agreed to take over a quarter of its policies, and it was forced to issue a stock offering, thus diluting existing stockholders, to raise money to pay claims. It took five years – during which the company shrank significantly – and a massive reorganization led by John J. Byrne and supported substantially by Buffett, to set GEICO on the path to recovery. Alvin E. Krause, retired from GEICO, was given carte blanche by the directors to help bring about a wholesale reorganization of GEICO&#x27;s underwriting operations – including promotions and dismissals. He helped nurse the insurance firm back to financial health. He was a director of the GEICO Corp. from 1978 to 1983, and was an honorary director at the time of his death. He was chairman of Criterion from 1978 to 1981. Having been with GEICO since 1938.

==Modern development==
GEICO generally deals directly with consumers via telephone and internet; however, the local agent program has more than 300 independent offices across the United States. GEICO is now the second-largest writer of private auto insurance in the country.

In 2015, GEICO began offering coverage for drivers of ridesharing companies in select states, including in high-population states such as Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Georgia. The policy, which is issued through GEICO&#x27;s commercial department, has received praise from insurance experts and quickly launched GEICO as the largest insurance provider for ridesharing company drivers.

In 2016, J.D. Power rated the company #20 out of 24 for overall purchase experience, with a 2/5 score.

In April 2021 a data breach was reported to have exposed customers’ driver’s license numbers through GEICO&#x27;s online sales application for over a month.

In October 2023, GEICO issued a return to office mandate for employees to return to their office on specific days. Many staff have been hybrid or fully remote in recent months. In addition, the insurance company announced it will lay off 2,000 staff members, or 6% of its workforce.

==Advertising campaigns==
GEICO has many well-known ad campaigns. In 2012 GEICO spent over US$1.1 billion in advertising, or 6.8% of its revenue. All campaigns are made and produced by The Martin Agency in Richmond, Virginia. GEICO ads have featured several well-known mascots, including:
* Martin the GEICO Gecko is their most well-known spokesperson mascot. He is voiced by British actor Jake Wood currently, though other actors have been used in the past, including Andrew Randall, and Kelsey Grammer.
* The GEICO Announcer is a voiceover artist in the commercial that it says. (&quot;GEICO. 15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.&quot;) He is voiced by Andrew Anthony.
* The GEICO Cavemen (from ads claiming using their website is &quot;so easy, a caveman could do it&quot;).
* Maxwell, the GEICO &quot;Piggy&quot; who shouts a long &quot;Whee&quot; and appears in more radio and TV commercials.
* Actor Mike McGlone, who uses film noir-style narration to compare the ease of GEICO to things, famous people, or idioms. (&quot;Could switching to GEICO really save you 15% or more on car insurance?...Is having a snowball fight with pitching great Randy Johnson a bad idea?&quot;) The scene is then acted out, with typically humorous results, similar to its “Did You Know” commercials. In addition to Johnson, other ads have included Charlie Daniels, Andrés Cantor, Foghorn Leghorn, Elmer Fudd, R. Lee Ermey, and Ed &quot;Too Tall&quot; Jones among others. This campaign is also notable for the creation of the &quot;Maxwell the Pig&quot; commercials (see above).
* The &quot;money savers&quot; campaign enlisted actors to portray average consumers who have resorted to various humorous extremes in order to save money, such as teaching a dog to sing or teaching a group of Guinea pigs to row a boat and perform some mundane task for the consumer, and then presented switching to GEICO as an easy alternative to such endeavors with the common line &quot;... there&#x27;s an easier way to save money.&quot;
* The &quot;Happier Than...&quot; duo features Jimmy (actor Timothy Ryan Cole) and Ronnie (musician Alex Harvey) playing a guitar and a mandolin, respectively, on a small portable stage. They comment on a fictitious preceding event, such as a man dressed in 15th-century attire laughing as he leads a trio of speed boats with the painted names &quot;Niña&quot;, &quot;Pinta&quot;, and &quot;Santa Maria&quot;. After cutting to the duo, one says to the other, &quot;You know, folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy.&quot; The other then replied, &quot;How happy are they, (Jimmy/Ronnie)?&quot; and in the case above, the response is &quot;Happier than Christopher Columbus with speedboats!&quot; This series is known for its viral &quot;Hump Day&quot; ad, showing a camel in an office.
* Kash, the stack of cash that represents the money insurance customers could have saved by switching to GEICO. &quot;Somebody’s Watching Me&quot; would play in the background.

There are also GEICO ads that feature stories from GEICO customers about situations in which the company assisted them, but are translated by celebrities like Little Richard and Joan Rivers. Film trailer announcer Don LaFontaine appeared in one such ad, shortly before his death. The tag announcer for these spots was D. C. Douglas. GEICO is also an official sponsor of the National Hockey League and themed commercials that always feature members of the hometown Washington Capitals.

==Motorsports==

=== NASCAR ===

GEICO has long been involved in motorsports sponsorship. Since 2008, the company has sponsored the Germain Racing team, first in the NASCAR Nationwide Series with Mike Wallace, and later in the NASCAR Cup Series with Max Papis and Casey Mears. Ty Dillon, grandson of racing legend Richard Childress, began driving the No. 13 GEICO Chevrolet in the 2017 season. In 2020, GEICO became a premier partner of the Cup Series, sharing title sponsorship rights with Busch Beer, Coca-Cola, and Xfinity. Germain and GEICO split at the end of 2020.

On September 20, 2024, it was announced that the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series would be the final season for GEICO as a premier partner of the Cup Series.

=== Pro Pulling League ===
GEICO also has presence in the PPL (Pro Pulling League) sponsoring Joe Eder and his Super Modified pulling tractor.

==Lawsuits==

In October 2015, the Consumer Federation of California successfully sued the company for US$6 million after alleged discrimination based on occupation, education level, and other personal characteristics.
In October 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld a verdict against the company for over US$700,000 in a breach of contract suit.

In November 2015, a jury in Miami awarded a family US$14.5 million after suing the company for insurance bad faith.

In December 2016, a federal Miami jury awarded US$2.7 million to a family who sued the company, claiming the company acted in bad faith.

In May 2019, the California Court of Appeal for the Second District affirmed a US$1 million judgment for punitive damages in an insurance bad faith action against GEICO (specifically, bad faith refusal to settle). This was in addition to an award of $313,000 in compensatory damages (which GEICO had not challenged on appeal).

In June 2022, a Missouri woman was awarded US$5.2 million after she sued the company, alleging that she had contracted a 
sexually transmitted disease through having sex in a car insured by GEICO. In January 2023, the Supreme Court of Missouri unanimously overturned the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings because the lower courts had not given GEICO an adequate opportunity to intervene in the case to protect its interests.

<text>The Bombardier CRJ/Mitsubishi CRJ or CRJ Series (for Canadair Regional Jet) is a family of regional jets introduced in 1991 by Bombardier Aerospace. The CRJ was manufactured by Bombardier Aerospace with the manufacturing of the first CRJ generation, the CRJ100/200 starting in 1991 and the second CRJ generation, the CRJ700 series starting in 1999.

The CRJ programme was acquired by Japanese corporation Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI RJ Aviation Group) in a deal that closed 1 June 2020. Bombardier subsequently completed the assembly of the order backlog on behalf of Mitsubishi.

Bombardier claims it is the most successful family of regional jets in the world. Production ended in December 2020 after 1,945 were built.

==Background==
The family consists of the following aircraft generations and models/derivatives:
* CRJ100/200
** CRJ100 – maximum of 50 passenger seats
** CRJ200 – maximum of 50 passenger seats, improved CF34-3B1 engine
*** CRJ440 – CRJ200 limited to 44 passenger seats
* CRJ700 series
** CRJ700 – maximum of 78 passenger seats
*** CRJ550 – CRJ700 limited to 50 passenger seats
** CRJ900 – maximum of 90 passenger seats
*** CRJ705 – CRJ900 limited to 75 passenger seats
** CRJ1000 – maximum of 104 passenger seats

== Divestment ==
, following Bombardier&#x27;s decisions to sell the CSeries to Airbus and the Q Series to De Havilland Canada, the company was looking at &quot;strategic options&quot; to return the CRJ to profitability. Analysts suspected that it might decide to exit the commercial aircraft market altogether and refocus on business aircraft. That prediction came to pass on 25 June 2019, when a deal was announced to sell the CRJ programme to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the parent company of Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation. Mitsubishi had a historic interest in the CRJ programme, having sounded out risk-sharing options with Bombardier, and were at one point expected to take a stake in its SpaceJet venture during the 1990s. Bombardier ceased new sales and announced that production of the CRJ would continue at Mirabel until the current order backlog was complete. The deal was to include the type certificate for the CRJ series; Bombardier worked with Transport Canada to separate the CRJ certificate from that of the Challenger.

Closure of the deal was confirmed on 1 June 2020, with Bombardier&#x27;s service and support activities transferred to a new Montreal-based company, MHI RJ Aviation Group. MHI RJ has not renamed the aircraft, and its website referred simply to the CRJ Series.

The final Bombardier CRJ to be produced, a CRJ900, finished production and was delivered to SkyWest Airlines on 28 February 2021.

In 2021, Mitsubishi investigated restarting production on the CRJ550, a variant of the CRJ700 limited to 50 passenger seats, similar to the nominal seating capacity of the 100/200 models. Restarting production would involve building a new plant, as the former plant is now making Airbus A220s, and taking the tooling out of storage. However, , Mitsubishi has not pursued a restart.

<text>George Leslie Mackay (偕瑞理 or 馬偕 &quot;Má-kai&quot;; 21 March 1844 – 2 June 1901) was a Canadian Presbyterian missionary. He was the first Presbyterian missionary to northern Taiwan (then Formosa), serving with the Canadian Presbyterian Mission. Mackay is among the best known and most influential Westerners to have lived in Taiwan.

==Early life==
George Leslie Mackay was born on March 21, 1844, the youngest of six children to a pioneering Scottish family in Embro, Zorra Township, Oxford County, Canada West (now Ontario), Canada. His family was part of the Zorra Pioneers, refugees from the Sutherland Clearances in northern Scotland, who arrived in Zorra in 1830. The Zorra pioneers were Evangelical Presbyterians, for whom their church, led by lay elders, was the centre of their collective life.

He received his theological training at Knox College in Toronto (1865-1867), Princeton Theological Seminary in the United States (1870), and New College, Edinburgh in Scotland, all Presbyterian institutions. In Mackay&#x27;s days Princeton and Edinburgh were important centres of advocacy and training for foreign missions.

==Mission to Taiwan==
In 1871, Mackay became the first foreign missionary to be commissioned by the Canada Presbyterian Church (predecessor of both the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the United Church of Canada), arriving in Taiwan on December 29, 1871.

After consulting with Dr. James Laidlaw Maxwell Sr., a medical doctor serving as a Presbyterian Church of England missionary to southern Formosa (1865), Mackay arrived at Tamsui, northern Formosa in 1872, which remained his home until his death in 1901. Starting with an itinerant dentistry practice amongst the lowland aborigines, he later established churches, schools and a hospital practicing Western biomedicine.

Mackay learned to speak vernacular Taiwanese fluently and married &quot;Minnie&quot; Tiu (), a native Taiwanese woman. The marriage produced three children:

* Mary &quot;Tan&quot; Mackay
* Bella &quot;Koa&quot; Mackay
* George William Mackay

Mackay was described by the Rev. William Campbell, a contemporary missionary, as:
Accompanied by his students, who were to become pastors of the churches founded, Mackay itinerated all across northern Taiwan. They founded 60 churches. Churches planted in north Taiwan by Mackay later became part of the Northern Synod of the present Presbyterian Church in Taiwan.

==Social impact of Mackay&#x27;s mission==

===Revitalization Movements===

Anthony Wallace developed the idea of “revitalization movement” in his study of the Handsome Lake movement in the Seneca of New York, “to denote any conscious, organized effort by members of a society to construct a more satisfying culture. Since many revitalization movements are religious, the concept of revitalization becomes central to the analysis of the development of new religions”. He argued that “when the misery of poverty and degradation is combined with a hope of moral and material salvation, the resulting mixture is explosive.” (1969:239).

What resulted when the Kavalan people (噶瑪蘭) heard Mackay&#x27;s preaching 1880s was a revitalization movement combining the egalitarian and salvific ideas of Mackay&#x27;s Presbyterianism and their own resistance to the land loss, cultural collapse and humiliating poverty brought by Chinese invasion of their homeland in the 19th century.

===Destruction of Kavalan Society===

In his monumental study, &quot;Statecraft and Political Economy on the Taiwan Frontier, 1600–1800&quot;, anthropologist John Shepherd traces the disaster that fell on the Kavalan in the 19th century: 
The fate of the aboriginal Kuvalan of the I-lan plain on Taiwan&#x27;s north-east coast provides a sharp contrast to that of the plains aborigines on the western coastal plain. Government administration was not extended to the I-lan plain before the nineteenth century, and the Kuvalan were not taxpaying subjects of the Ch’ing, which therefore did not recognize Kuvalan title to unclaimed land. Han migration to the isolated I-lan plain in the early nineteenth century began suddenly and on a large scale. Thus, the Kuvalan did not have an opportunity to adapt gradually to the consequences of Han settlement ... The Kuvalan were totally unprepared for the onslaught of Chinese settlers that saw the Han population of I-lan grow to nearly 40,000 by 1810. ... [Despite policies by the first prefect, Yang T&#x27;ing-li, attempting to protect aborigine land rights,] it was too little too late, for the Kuvalan were unable to adapt to such rapid change. They lacked the sophistication and institutional position necessary to see their rights enforced against unscrupulous Han. Impoverished Kuvalan, who were poor farmers, alienated their lands for ready cash. By the end of the nineteenth century, the Kuvalan population had declined by approximately 70 percent, and many were migrating to Hua-lien.

Indigenous historian Chan Su-chuan 詹素娟 ，describes the “extremely difficult situation” confronting the Kavalan in the 1880s: 
“The period when Mackay entered Ilan was exactly the period in the late 19th century when traditional Kavalan society was facing shocks from an external power and was undergoing large scale forced emigration ... With the changes in their social and economic life, the traditional religion of the Kavalan people also underwent huge changes. Mackay observed that the faith of the Kavalan people was “at the present time a potpourri of Confucian morality, Buddhistic idolatry, and Tauistic demonolatry”, which is to say the Taiwanese folk religion of that time. But Mackay also saw that the in fact the Kavalan people still “simultaneously” preserved their traditions “nature worship” and “relics of superstition”. Mackay wrote that the traditional religious life of the Kavalan “had no temple, idol or priest.

Mackay was angered at the plight of the Kavalan. He must have seen in their crisis a reflection of the collective memory of his own people, the Highland refugees from the Sutherland Clearances, who were burnt out of their cottages by officials clearing the land for sheep:

There were at one time thirty-six thriving villages in the Kap-tsu-lan plain. The Chinese settlers came in, enterprising, aggressive, and not overly scrupulous, and little by little the weaker went to the wall. The Pe-po-hoan were crowded out of the cultivated land, many of their villages were scattered, and they had to begin life again in the waste jungle. And, very often, when they had succeeded in reclaiming land to grow rice and vegetables enough to supply their meager wants, the greedy Chinese would appear again, and, either by winning their confidence or by engaging them in dispute, would gain a foothold and in the end rob them of their lands. Being unable to read and being ignorant of the law, they are almost entirely at the mercy of their enemies. It sometimes makes one’s blood boil to see the iniquities practised upon these simple-minded creatures by Chinese officials, speculators and traders.

He was aware of the political context of Kavalan adoption of Chinese idols:

Originally the Pe-po-hoan were nature worshippers, like the savages in the mountains …. But all this was changed when they bowed their necks to the yoke of civilization. Their conquerors forced upon them not only the cue and their style of dress, but also the whole paraphernalia of Chinese idolatry. Whenever a tribe submits, the first thing is to shave the head in token of allegiance, and then temples, idols and tablets are introduced. …. Idolatry does not suit the average Pe-po-hoan, and it is only of necessity that he submits to even the formal observance of its rites and ceremonies. It is political rather than religious, and to the large majority it is meaningless, except as a reminder of their enslavement to an alien race” 

 It is in this context that the rapid, mass conversion of almost one-half of the Kavalan people in the early 1880s can be understood. It was not a colonial fraud enforced upon devout practitioners of traditional Chinese folk religion, or destruction of indigenous people&#x27;s traditional religion but an indigenous revitalization movement - a collective symbolic act of resistance to the dispossession they suffered under the Chinese settlers. Mackay was clearly astounded by the response of the Kavalan to his evangelism, so different from the process of conversion in the rest of north Taiwan.

===Idol burning===

The removal of idols and ancestral tablets by new Christians in Taiwan was usually a discreet individual decision. A typical reference (among many in Mackay&#x27;s diary) to people removing idols, is in a letter of April 11, 1884: “An old Chinaman and his wife cleansed their house of idols last Saturday when I was in the country. These idols &amp;c. are now with my large collection.”

But in the Kavalan mission Mackay reports two instances of mass enthusiasm (another expression of a revitalization movement) expressed in communal removal and burning of Chinese household idols. The first is reported in letters of March 30 and June 5, 1883:

I am here about 4 days journey from Tamsui -on the east side of the Island with the Pacific dashing this shore. There are 36 villages of Pe-po-hoan (civilized aborigines) in this District. Fully one thousand (1000) have thrown away their idols and wish to be taught Christianity. ... I dried my clothes before fires made of idolatrous paper, idols &amp;c. I employed 3 men to carry other idols back to Tamsui . I never passed through such an experience.

The revitalization movement in the form of communal removal of Chinese idols proceeded even without the presence of Mackay, who was amazed at what he saw happening. In a letter addressed “To the Presbyterian Church in Canada from Halifax to Manitoba” (June 5, 1883) he wrote:
I sent a telegram some time ago to say that 1000 were asking Christian instruction. I state below the mark now when I declare that upwards of 2000 (two thousand) have thrown idols away and wish to follow the Lord of Hosts. ... In a village with upwards of 200 every soul wants to be Christian – every house cleansed of idols. Another village with nearly 300 not very far away came out as a body, men, women and children and already sing our sweet hymns long in the night.

===Visit to Kavalan settlement in Hualien – September 1890 ===
The second reference to communal idol burning is September 8–9, 1890, when Mackay, accompanied by Koa-kau and Tan-he travelled by boat to visit Kavalan people who had settled in Ka-le-oan (嘉禮宛) north of Hualien City(花蓮港). His letter to the Foreign Missionary Society (September 12) presents in detail the process of community decision making, the political symbolism of having idols, negotiating with the Chinese authorities for their consent to remove idols, and the celebratory nature of the burning, followed by a ritual celebrating the new communitas. 
Mackay letter to Wardrope Oct. 16th 1890: About dark we entered Ka-le-oan (the Pin-po-hoan settlement I longed to visit for upwards of a dozen years). We found the cook , who turned out Preacher, in a small grass covered bamboo dwelling which had been erected for him. As they had been sending letters and visiting for such a long time you have only to imagine the reception accorded us. ... The room was soon packed and a large crowd stood in front of the door. Instead of continued preaching we tried to grasp the real state of affairs. Real good work was done by the Helper. Not a few had a clear idea of the Gospel message, while all were evidently wearied of idol worship. They seemed ripe for decisive action. Being told that the Military Mandarin declared that they must continue idolatry as being a token of subjection to China. I rode up to the encampment – had an interview and got a gracious reception. Whatever was said or done in the past, it was all right now. Soldiers began to praise our mission ... There was only one opinion and the Official wished me “Peace”. I galloped back and asked all who were for the True God to clean their houses of idols and take a decided stand. – A council was held at dark in an open space, it turned out to be a boisterous one. The chiefs were declaiming aloud in their native tongue. I stepped into their midst – and asked an explanation – asked if there was difference of opinion? An answer came quickly, the five villages were unanimous to a man. Every man, woman and child wished to worship One God the Creator of all. They were noisy because giving vent to their indignation for having served idols for so long. – Another important transaction was executed – a temple for idols built by themselves at a cost of $2000 was handed over for chapel service the all retired and the tumult abated. The following was a joyous day; no one went to work – The Head men joined our party (after invitation) and ordered four boys to carry 8 baskets one on each end of a pole. Then we went from village to village and house to house until the idolatrous paraphernalia all were put into the baskets and carried to a yard near our Preaching room and temple. – There was large Pile of mock money – idols – incense sticks, flags &amp;c &amp;c --- a great crowd assembled and several vied with each other in kindling it – many showed their contempt for the dirty, dusty, greasy old idols and all were jubilant over the work. ... Nearly five hundred idolaters cleaned their houses of idols in our presence.

==Other results of Mackay&#x27;s Kavalan Mission==
Similar to other indigenous groups in northern Taiwan, the Kavalan has a patronymic name system, rather than surnames. When they came under Chinese rule they were assigned Chinese names and surnames. By the mid-1880s some Kavalan had adopted Mackay&#x27;s Taiwanese surname “Kai” 偕 as their own. This surname is still common among Kavalan people today.
In 1882 “Oxford College” (for men) was opened in Tamsui and a year later the Girls School. Soon both schools had Kavalan students. In 1884 John Jamieson reported in a letter to the Foreign Mission Committee (June 30, 1884) that “The girls have made excellent progress during their four months of study. Most of them can read the Colloquial language as well as write a fair hand. ... Most of the students have left for their homes and Dr. Mackay will accompany the girls on their homeward journey. “ 

At the girls’ school Kai Ah-hun was matron and instructor in traditional weaving and sewing. She was married to a Kavalan pastor. Her work was outstanding, so much so that Mackay brought an entire Kavalan bridal assemblage made by her to Canada in 1893. We know this because he had a photograph of her taken wearing the very clothes that are now in the Royal Ontario Museum. The Kavalan bridal attire is the only complete set of Kavalan clothes in the world, rightfully considered a national treasure of Taiwan.

Among the ten Plains Indigenous groups (Ping-pu 平埔) who occupied the entire western half of Taiwan, only the Kavalan have continued as an organized community, still using their own language, in their exilic home on the northern coast of Hualien County. In the last decade a group of women weavers (the leader is surnamed Kai 偕) have been reviving traditional weaving. They hope to visit the Mackay Collection at the Royal Ontario Museum to study the textiles that came from Kai Ah-hun in 1893.

While the mission among the Kavalan was only one part of Mackay&#x27;s 30-year life in Taiwan, it illustrates the unintended yet long lasting impact of Mackay&#x27;s work, and helps explain why even after 150 years he is so celebrated in Taiwan&#x27;s history.

In 1896, after the 1895 establishment of Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan, Mackay met with the Japanese Governor-General of Formosa, Maresuke Nogi. Some families in Taiwan today, particularly of lowland-aboriginal Kavalan ancestry, trace their surname &#x27;偕&#x27; (&#x27;Kai&#x27; or &#x27;Kay&#x27;) to their family&#x27;s conversion to Christianity by Mackay.

In Canada Mackay was honoured during his two furloughs home by the Canadian Church. In 1880, Queen&#x27;s College in Kingston, Ontario awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity, presented by Principal George Monro Grant and Chancellor Sandford Fleming. Before departing in 1881, he returned to Oxford County, where monies were raised to start Oxford College in Taiwan, which would be the basis for two later educational institutions, Aletheia University and Taiwan Seminary. A number of young people in the county were inspired to follow Mackay&#x27;s example and entered into missionary service with a number of Christian denominations.

In June 1894, at the General Assembly meeting in St. John, New Brunswick, Mackay was elected Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the highest elected position in the church. He spent the following Moderatoral year travelling across Canada, as well as writing &quot;From Far Formosa: the island, its people and missions&quot;, a missionary ethnography and memoir of his missionary experiences.

In 1894 he spoke out against the head tax imposed on Chinese immigrants to Canada. As moderator of the Presbyterian church, he broke precedent to speak in favor of a resolution opposing this tax, saying it was unjust and racist.

Although Mackay suffered from meningitis and malaria in his lifetime, he would die of throat cancer on 2 June 1901 in Tamsui. He was interred in Tamsui, Taiwan, in a small cemetery in the eastern corner of the Tamkang Middle School campus. His son was interred adjacent to him.

==Legacy==
In Taiwan&#x27;s modern democratic period Mackay&#x27;s life has been celebrated by advocates of a distinctive Taiwanese identity and historical understanding separate from colonial narratives brought by Japan and China. The system of phonetic romanisation he and his collaborators developed for writing Taiwan&#x27;s Hokkien language is still in use.

Mackay&#x27;s &quot;From Far Formosa&quot; is considered an important early missionary ethnography of Taiwan. It provides a valuable source document for understanding the culture and customs of the people of Taiwan during Mackay&#x27;s lifetime.

As part of his teaching Mackay created a museum in his Tamsui home. Its collections of items from both Chinese and Indigenous cultures of Taiwan, and specimens of geology, flora and fauna was constantly replentished by donations from local people. Many items collected by Mackay are today housed at the Royal Ontario Museum (Ontario, Canada) and the Aletheia University Museum (Tamsui, Taiwan). James Rohrer, missionary historian, states that Mackay, &quot;allowed himself to truly encounter and to be transformed by the people he sought to serve.&quot;

===Community===

Mackay&#x27;s Oxford College (牛津學堂) is today known as Aletheia University. The major private Christian hospital in downtown Taipei is named Mackay Memorial Hospital, built in 1912 to replace the smaller Mackay Hospital he started in Tamsui in 1882. Many artefacts collected by Mackay today form part of the collections at the Royal Ontario Museum (Ontario, Canada) and Aletheia University (Tamsui, Taiwan).

On 30 June 2004, a large bust statue of Mackay was dedicated outside the Oxford County offices in Woodstock, Ontario. The delegation from Taiwan in attendance included representatives from Aletheia University and the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan. The event was also attended by representatives of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the United Church of Canada, local, regional, and national Canadian dignitaries, and a number of Mackay descendants from across North America. One of his grandchildren is Dr. John Ross Mackay.

In November 2006, a Canadian television documentary titled &quot;The Black Bearded Barbarian of Taiwan&quot; was aired. It was broadcast in both Mandarin and English on OMNI 2 as part of their &quot;Signature Series&quot;.

====Opera====

Composer Gordon S.W. Chin and librettist Joyce Chiou set out in 2002 to create an opera whose subject was drawn from Taiwan&#x27;s history. In 2008 Taiwan&#x27;s government invested in the project: the world&#x27;s first-ever Taiwanese grand opera, &quot;Mackay: The Black-Bearded Bible Man&quot;. Chin&#x27;s opera drew inspiration from the events of the missionary&#x27;s life and took more than five years to produce. Over a hundred singers and production crew were engaged for the project from Europe, Asia, and North America.

&quot;Mackay: The Black-Bearded Bible Man&quot; had its world premier on 27 November 2008 at Taiwan&#x27;s National Theater and ran through 30 November. The large cast featured Thomas Meglioranza (baritone) as George Mackay, Chen Mei-Lin (soprano) as Mackay&#x27;s wife Tiuⁿ Chhang-miâ, and Choi Seung-Jin (tenor) as Giâm Chheng-hoâ, Mackay&#x27;s first disciple and follower in Taiwan. Chien Wen-Pin, a native of Taipei, conducted the National Symphony Orchestra (Taiwan). Lukas Hemleb directed the stage production.

====Musical theatre====

&quot;Kai the Barbarian: the George Leslie Mackay Story&quot;, a musical theatre piece by William Butt, was performed March 21–31, 2018 at Thistle Theatre in Embro, Ontario, Canada. The stage director was Edward Daranyi and music director was Daniel Van Winden. Embro, hometown of the author, is located in Zorra Township where George Mackay was born and raised. Cast and crew consisted of local volunteers working alongside professionals from Stratford, Ontario.

<doc id="571967" wikidata="Q455226" url="?curid=571967" title="Shannon (American singer)">
<text>Brenda Shannon Greene (born May 2, 1958), known professionally as Shannon, is an American singer and songwriter of freestyle and dance-pop music. She is best known for her single &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart in 1983 and was certified gold.

Her studio albums include &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; (1984), followed by &quot;Do You Wanna Get Away&quot; (1985) and &quot;Love Goes All the Way&quot; (1986). In 1999, Shannon appeared in a segment of VH1&#x27;s &quot;One-Hit Wonders&quot;, and returned to music with her fourth studio album &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot; (2000). Her most recent studio album, &quot;A Beauty Returns&quot;, was released in 2006.

==Career==

Shannon was born in Washington, D.C., United States. In 1983, she was enrolled at York College in New York City and toured with the New York Jazz Ensemble. Quintin Hicks, an associate of the production team of Mark Liggett and Chris Barbosa, saw Shannon singing with a live band in her cousin&#x27;s recording studio. She auditioned for Liggett and Barbosa with the song &quot;She Can&#x27;t Love You Like I Do&quot;. They introduced her to the selection &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, which would later evolve into Shannon&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;(Mirage Records/Emergency Records); its unique sound, called &quot;the Shannon Sound&quot;, would later come to be known as &quot;freestyle&quot;. &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; would also be the title of Shannon&#x27;s debut studio album, which she released through the team in 1984.

In July 1983, &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; was released on New York-based dance label Emergency and Shannon was invited back to record more songs with Liggett and Barbosa. The single reached #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B and #1 on the Hot Dance Club Play charts. It also was ranked at #49 of &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top 100 songs of 1984. It was later ranked #23 among &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s best dance songs of all-time.

Her debut studio album, &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;, was released on February 1, 1984. &quot;Give Me Tonight&quot;, the follow-up single, reached the number-two spot on the R&amp;B charts and number one on the Hot Dance Club Play charts. The song went to number 46 on the pop charts. It was one of &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s top 30 dance songs for the year of 1984. In the United States, the third single was &quot;My Heart&#x27;s Divided&quot;. The single, featuring Jimi Tunnell as one of the backing vocalists, hit #3 on the Dance Chart. &quot;Sweet Somebody&quot;, a mid-tempo soul effort, made the Top 20 in a few European nations.

Shannon&#x27;s studio album &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; went on to sell approximately 1.5 million worldwide, with 500,000 of those sold in the United States, earning gold certification. Shannon was nominated for a Grammy Award and received numerous other awards, including the Dinah Washington (Jack the Rapper) Award, the Hall of Fame Award, the Gold Ampex Reel Award, a certified gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America, and the Best &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 female R&amp;B vocalist.

In 1985, she released her second studio album, &quot;Do You Wanna Get Away&quot;. The title track was the first single and it became her third single to appear on the Hot 100, and her third single to hit #1 on the Dance Chart. She scored three more dance hits, including &quot;Stronger Together&quot;, a cover of &quot;Urgent&quot; by Foreigner, and &quot;Stop the Noise&quot;, with a video sponsored by Pepsi and Black Angus. &quot;Love Goes All the Way&quot;, Shannon&#x27;s third studio album, was released in 1986.

Shannon asked to be released from her recording contract with Atlantic Records in 1987. She recorded soundtracks, jingles, and the track &quot;Criminal&quot;, for the movie &quot;Fatal Beauty&quot;, starring Whoopi Goldberg. While touring the world, Shannon attended and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.

In 1998, she cowrote and sang on multi-tracks produced by Todd Terry, Tony Moran, and Germany&#x27;s Sash! and Les Rythmes Digitales. The Shannon single &quot;Move Mania&quot; (Sash!) became an EU dance hit. In 1999, Shannon appeared in a segment of VH1&#x27;s &quot;One-Hit Wonders&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; also taped a special about her life. She was managed for a period of time by Eric Vega producer of shows and events. In 2005 the NBC TV show &quot;Hit Me, Baby, One More Time&quot; aired a full interview on Shannon&#x27;s life, music, and a pre-taped performance in front of a studio audience for national airing.

Shannon&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;, was released on March 28, 2000. She is credited as 50 percent writer of the album. Chris Barbosa served as a producer, along with Andy &quot;Panda&quot; Tripoli and Tony Moran. This venture thrust Shannon back onto the dance scene and &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Charts in the early 2000s with top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Remixes by veteran DJ/Mixer Junior Vasquez (For &quot;Let the Music Play – The Lost Mixes&quot; – #3 US &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Dance Charts), and Hex Hector for &quot;Give Me Tonight&quot;. Shannon later released a compilation album, &quot;Let the Music Play: The Best of Shannon&quot;, in 2004.

On April 20, 2006, Shannon participated in the Freestyle Extranvaganza concert along with artists Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, the Cover Girls, Coro, and Stevie B The event was sponsored by WKTU, WSKQ, and WCAA in New York.

A fifth studio album, &quot;A Beauty Returns&quot;, was released in 2006. Today, Shannon is a voting member of the Grammy&#x27;s (Recording Academy), and she occasionally performs shows around the world. In 2016, Carnival Cruise Line ran a national television campaign featuring music performed by her. In 2017, Shannon was a contestant on the Fox game show &quot;Beat Shazam&quot; where she was partnered with former Stetsasonic member Bobby Simmons.

<text>Pointing dogs, sometimes called bird dogs, are a type of gundog typically used in finding game. Gundogs are traditionally divided into three classes: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. The name &quot;pointer&quot; comes from the dog&#x27;s instinct to &quot;point&quot;, by stopping and aiming its muzzle towards game. This demonstrates to the hunter the location of their quarry and allows them to move into gun range. Pointers were selectively bred from dogs who had abundant pointing and backing instinct. They typically start to acquire their hunting instincts at about 2 months of age.

==History==
Pointing dogs may have descended from dogs from Spain, specifically of the Old Spanish Pointer (Furgus, 2002). Pointing dogs were originally used by hunters who netted the game. The dog would freeze or set (as in Setter) and allow the hunter to throw the net over the game before it flushed. Flushing dogs, on the other hand, were often used by falconers to flush game for the raptors. Most continental European pointing breeds are classified as &quot;versatile gun dog&quot; breeds or sometimes &quot;HPR breeds&quot; (for hunt, point, and retrieve). The distinction is made because versatile breeds were developed to find and point game as all pointing breeds, but were also bred to perform other hunting tasks as well. This distinction likely arose because while the British developed breeds which specialized in tasks such as pointing, flushing, and retrieving from land or water, in Continental Europe, the same dog was trained to be able to perform each of these tasks (albeit less effectively). The North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association defines versatility as &quot;the dog that is bred and trained to dependably hunt and point game, to retrieve on both land and water, and to track wounded game on both land and water.&quot; As an example, German Shorthaired Pointers are often used to retrieve birds, i.e. duck hunting, whereas calling upon a Pointer to do the same would be less common. Unlike the pure pointing and setting breeds, many versatile dogs were bred for working in dense cover, and traditionally have docked tails.

The Westminster Kennel Club was organized in the early 1870s, and the club&#x27;s early English import, &quot;Sensation&quot;, is still used as the club logo.

==Appearance==
Pointing dogs come in all varieties of coats, from short-haired dogs, to wire-haired dogs, to silky-coated Setters. Most breeds tend to have some sort of spots on their body, whether the spots are small and round, or a large oval shape.

== Breeds ==

* English Setter

<text>Marla Hanson (born June 18, 1961) is an American screenwriter and ex-model who was the victim of a slashing attack instigated by her landlord in 1986.

==Early life==
Born in Independence, Missouri, Hanson graduated from Odessa High School in Odessa, Missouri, and attended college at Southwestern Assemblies of God University in Waxahachie, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. After working as a real estate and insurance saleswoman, a job promotion brought her to New York City, where she took a part-time modeling job that eventually became her full-time career in the 1980s.

==Attack==
In June 1986, Hanson became involved in a dispute with her landlord, Steve Roth, over a security deposit that he owed her. She had also previously rejected his romantic advances. Roth hired two friends, Steven Bowman and Darren Norman, to attack Hanson. Hanson testified that Roth asked her to step outside a bar, and then stood by while the two men, after announcing a &quot;stick-up,&quot; slashed her face with a razor blade. The assault left three wounds that required surgery and over 100 stitches to close, resulting in permanent scars.

Roth and the two attackers were tried separately, with Judge Jeffrey Atlas presiding over both trials. In Roth&#x27;s trial, a lawyer for Roth suggested that his breaking off of a long-term gay relationship with Bowman that day led Bowman to attack Hanson out of jealousy. In Roth&#x27;s trial, he was found guilty of first degree assault for arranging the attack.

In the trial of Bowman and Norman a few months later,
Hanson was subjected to a controversial cross examination by Bowman&#x27;s defense attorney Alton H. Maddox, who impugned her character in a line of questioning the prosecutor called &quot;disgusting and filthy&quot;. Maddox also asserted that Hanson had &quot;racial hangups&quot; that led her to falsely identify Bowman and Norman, who are black, as her attackers. 
Hanson and her attorney later publicly criticized the criminal justice system for allowing her to be humiliated on the witness stand. Bowman and Norman were found guilty.

At sentencing, Atlas gave Roth the 5 to 15 year maximum sentence,
but not before telling a weeping Hanson and her attorney he was &quot;incensed&quot; at their public criticism of the criminal justice system. After a brief recess, Atlas apologized to Hanson and her lawyer. Mayor Ed Koch expressed outrage at Atlas&#x27;s comments. Bowman and Norman were sentenced to the 5 to 15 year maximum sentence as well.
Hanson has since lobbied for reform in the way victims of crimes are treated in criminal courts.

==Screenwriter==
Her works as a screenwriter include:

*&quot;The Blackout&quot; (1997) 
*&quot;Subway Stories&quot; (1997) 
==Personal life==
In 1997, Hanson married Douglas Howell, whom she had met on a flight to Cuba a few months earlier. They have a daughter together.

==In popular culture==
The story of the attack on Hanson was made into a TV movie entitled &quot;The Marla Hanson Story&quot; in 1991 where she was portrayed by Cheryl Pollak.

Hanson was featured on episode 3 of the Netflix series &quot;Skin Decision: Before and After&quot;. She received numerous treatments to improve her skin.

<text>&quot;Ras&quot; Makonnen Wolde Mikael Wolde Melekot (Amharic: ራስ መኮንን ወልደ ሚካኤል ወልደ መለኮት; 8 May 1852 – 21 March 1906), or simply Ras Makonnen, also known as Abba Qagnew (አባ ቃኘው), was an Ethiopian royal from Shewa, a military leader, the governor of Harar, and the father of future Emperor Haile Selassie. Described by Nikolai Gumilev as “one of the greatest leaders of Abyssinia”, he served in the First Italo-Ethiopian War, playing a key role at the Battle of Adwa.

== Biography ==

&quot;Ras&quot; Makonnen Wolde Mikael Wolde Melekot was born in Derefo Maryam near Ankober, in what was then in the province of Menz to his mother &quot;Woizero&quot; Tenagnework Sahle Selassie and his father &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Wolde Mikael Wolde Melekot, who was the governor of the provinces Menz and Doba (which are located in Semien Shewa) His maternal lineage is ethnically Amhara with a Solomonic genealogy, his mother was a daughter of Sahle Selassie of Shewa.

In 1865, at the age of 14 his father took him to the court of &quot;Negus&quot; Menelik, then ruler of Shewa, where he engaged in military training and imbibed the skills of statecraft. Around July 1873, Makonnen married Yeshimebet Ali, the Oromo daughter of &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Ali and &quot;Woizero&quot; Wolete Giyorgis. In 1875, Yilma Makonnen was born to Makonnen and a woman who was not Yeshimebet Ali. In 1892, Tafari Makonnen, the son of Makonnen and Yeshimebet Ali, was born. In 1901, following the death of Yeshimebet Ali, Makonnen was briefly married to a niece of Empress Taytu Betul, &quot;Woizero&quot; Mentewab Wale. Makonnen&#x27;s marriage to Mentewab Wale was never consummated and, in 1902, it was annulled.

In 1876, Makonnen was awarded the rank of &quot;Balambaras&quot; and by 1881 commanded 1,000 well armed troops. In the same year he served in a campaign against the Arsi Oromo who were disrupting trade caravans from Tadjoura. He served in the battle of Battle of Embabo, and fought against the Arsi for a second time. Makonnen lead the troops that captured the Amir&#x27;s field cannons during the Battle of Chelenqo.

=== Governorship ===
In 1887, Makonnen was given the governorship of Harar after it was incorporated into the Ethiopian Empire by his cousin, Emperor Menelik following the Battle of Chelenqo. According to Jules Borelli, Harar was pillaged by Abyssinian soldiers with half its population fleeing, despite pleas from the despoiled locals to Makonnen. According to Hararis, the oppression of Harari people began with the invasion of Harar by &quot;Ras&quot; Makonnen which followed mosques changed into churches and Abyssinian Christians arriving from the north to settle in the town. Makonnen had ordered the primary mosque of Harar to be replaced by an Orthodox Church. The French traveler Charles Michel notes that &quot;the first years of the Abyssinian occupation were far from prosperous&quot; as the Abyssinians &quot;took for themselves what could have any value&quot;, while &quot;the soldiers, several thousand in number, chased the Hararis from their dwellings to install themselves in their place, and devastated everything around them.&quot; Trade and traders were driven away from the city and markets were held instead in the remote countryside. As the occupation progressed, Makonnen set about undermining Harari wealth by expropriating their land and offering it to his soldiers.

At Harar, Makonnen enjoyed good relations with expatriates, including Capuchin missionaries and a growing number of Europeans enroute to the capital. From there he learned as much as possible about the outside world. He especially appreciated Russians due to their shared Orthodox faith, and unlike other western Europeans, did not have colonial pretensions. Makonnen also had a passion for firearms and was heavily involved in the local arms trade, he imported weapons, some of whom he shipped to Shewa, others he used to subdue or extract tribute from the nearby Somalis. Makonnen pushed the expansion of the empire to the east and south of Harar, conquering the territories of the Issa and the Gadabuursi. In 1890, more reinforcements from Addis Ababa allowed Makonnen to occupy all of the Ogaden by 1891. In 1896 Ras Makonnen appointed Abdullah Tahir, governor of Jigjiga.

Conditions in the city rapidly improved once the soldiers left for service in the Ogaden. The Harari nobility was allowed some participation in the city&#x27;s government, as running of the city was entrusted to the Amir&#x27;s nephew, Ali. However ravaging and additional atrocities against the populace by the Abyssinians did not cease, the Harari people soon revolted and Makonnen marched into town with his troops, cowed the population, and imprisoned Ali. Once in the town, the troops went wild, demolished and looted homes, tyrannized the population, and killed several people. According to historian Norman Bennett, Makonnen may have aroused an insurrection to obtain absolute power in Harar. He successively replaced Ali with two other Harari viceroys, Yusuf Berkhedle and Haji Abdullahi Sadiq.

===Diplomat===
Due to his familiarly with the Europeans, he was soon made to lead Ethiopian missions aboard. His first trip took place in 1889 to witness Rome&#x27;s formal ratification of the Treaty of Wuchale which provided a welcome opportunity to buy modern weapons and ammunition. On his way home in 1890, he stopped in Jerusalem, where he purchased land on behalf of the Ethiopian government, and the Greek patriarch presented him with a gold crucifix in which a sliver of the True Cross was embedded. In April of that year, after arriving in Addis Ababa, he was promoted to the rank of &quot;Ras&quot;.

Back at home, Makonnen took part in debates about Article 17 of the Treaty of Wuchale, condemning Italy&#x27;s position. In 1892, Ras Makonnen was summoned to Shewa because of Italian intrigue in Tigray, an insurrection in Gojjam, and an attempted palace coup. Makonnen spent much of the next 2 years participating in internal and external debates about Article 17. In the meantime his well equipped troops in Harar underwent raiding expeditions throughout the Somali lowlands to capture sheep and cattle to restock highland herds decimated by the rinderpest epidemic.

====Italo-Ethiopian War====
In early 1895, tensions with Italy dramatically increased into the outbreak of the First Italo-Ethiopian War. Despite the security problems in Hararghe, Ras Makonnen and his well equipped troops eagerly took part in the war against the Italians. Ras Makonnen&#x27;s Harar army took spearheaded Menelik&#x27;s forces in their northern march to confront the occupying Italians in Tigray province. The first clash occurred on 7 December 1895 during Battle of Amba Alagi when Pietro Toselli came under attack by the troops of Ras Makonnen, had occupied the road leading back to Eritrea, and launched a surprise attack on the flanks of Toselli&#x27;s men, completely devastating the Italian force.

Ras Makonnen followed up this victory by reaching the Italian fort at Mekelle, surrounding it with his men and launching a series of abortive attacks on the Italian fort. Makonnen had hinted girmly that he might not come out alive during this attack, which resulted in Menelik II to order Ras Alula to prevent him from getting killed and keep watch on his cousin. As a result, Alula and Ras Mengesha Yohannes had Makonnen under arrest at Taytu Betul&#x27;s orders until the rest of Menelik&#x27;s army could join the battle. Once Menelik arrived at Mekelle, he called off the attack and had established contact with the Italian commander, giving him the opportunity to leave peacefully in exchange for surrender. On January 21, with permission from the Italian high command, the Italian commander agreed to surrender, allowing them to peacefully leave Mekelle with their weapons. Ras Mekonnen was sent to &quot;escort&quot; them back to Italian lines – a convenient way to bring a major part of the Ethiopian army to scout deep into Italian-held territory.

Ras Makonnen&#x27;s troops played an important role at the Battle of Adwa, his men spent much of the battle mauling Matteo Albertone&#x27;s Brigade on the slopes of Enda Keret, then occupying Mount Gusoso between Albertone&#x27;s and Dabormida&#x27;s position. His forces then turn on Dabormida Brigade, allowing the Oromo cavalry to decimate it while attempting to withdraw.

===Travel abroad===
In 1902, &quot;Ras&quot; Makonnen attended the coronation of King Edward VII in London. He arrived in June to the ceremony originally scheduled for 26 June, and stayed in Europe while the King recovered from an operation, attending the rescheduled ceremony on 9 August. Between these dates, he paid visits to various parts of the United Kingdom, and visited Italy, France, Turkey, and Germany. He received the following decorations: Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG) during an audience with King Edward VII on 8 August 1902, Star of the Russian Order of St. Anne, Star of the French &quot;Legion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; (Third Republic), Star of the Order of the Crown of Italy, Star of the Ottoman Order of Osmania.

=== Death ===
In early 1906 the governor of Italian Eritrea, Ferdinando Martini, was on an official visit to Ethiopia. Menelik II summoned Ras Makonnen to Addis Ababa. While travelling from Harar to Addis Ababa, &quot;Ras&quot; Makonnen came down with typhus. His officers brought him to Kulubi, where he died as daylight broke after having given his son Tafari Makonnen a whispered benediction. Menelik was said to be very distraught after hearing about the death of his cousin and intensely grieved for three days.

== Monument to Ras Makonnen ==
The Monument to Ras Makonnen previously located in Harar was sculpted in 1959, by Antun Augustinčić, a Croatian sculptor active in former Yugoslavia and the United States. In June 2020 the equestrian Monument to Ras Makonnen was toppled and destroyed by Oromo mobs who participated in Hachalu Hundessa riots, following the death of Hachalu Hundessa. It is alleged the Harari Regional state police officers supported its removal. The event was also followed by smashing of the Statue of Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael&#x27;s son and Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie in Wimbledon park, UK. Referring to a statue in Addis Ababa of Menelik II, Hachalu told Oromia Media Network (OMN) said that people should remember that all the horses seen mounted by old rulers leaders belonged to the people.

<text>Bolinas Bay is a small bay, approximately 5 miles (8 km) long, on the Pacific coast of California in the United States. It is in Marin County, north of the Golden Gate, approximately 15 miles (25 km) northwest of San Francisco. The town of Bolinas is at its shore.

The bay is fed by Bolinas Lagoon, a large inner harbor protected from the main bay by a spit of land, known as Stinson Beach.

Along with nearby Drakes Bay, the bay is considered one of the possible landing spots of Francis Drake in 1579 during his circumnavigation of the world by sea.

<text>Simulcast (a portmanteau of simultaneous broadcast) is the broadcasting of programs or events across more than one resolution, bitrate or medium, or more than one service on the same medium, at exactly the same time (that is, simultaneously). For example, Absolute Radio is simulcast on both AM and on satellite radio. Likewise, the BBC&#x27;s Prom concerts were formerly simulcast on both BBC Radio 3 and BBC Television. Another application is the transmission of the original-language soundtrack of movies or TV series over local or Internet radio, with the television broadcast having been dubbed into a local language. Yet another is when a sports game, such as Super Bowl LVIII, is simulcast on multiple television networks at the same time. In the case of Super Bowl LVIII, the game&#x27;s main broadcast channel was CBS, but viewers could watch it on other CBS-owned television channels or streaming services as well; Nickelodeon and Paramount+ showed the English-language broadcast, while Univision showed the same visual but had Spanish-language broadcasters for its audio.

==Early radio simulcasts==
Before launching stereo radio, experiments were conducted by transmitting left and right channels on different radio channels. The earliest record found was a broadcast by the BBC in 1926 of a Halle Orchestra concert from Manchester, using the wavelengths of the regional stations and Daventry.

In its earliest days, the BBC often transmitted the same programme on the &quot;National Service&quot; and the &quot;Regional Network&quot;.

An early use of the word &quot;simulcast&quot; is from 1925.

Between 1990 and 1994, the BBC broadcast a channel of entertainment (Radio 5) which offered a wide range of simulcasts, taking programmes from the BBC World Service and Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4 for simultaneous broadcast.

==Simulcasting to provide stereo sound for TV broadcasts==
Before stereo TV sound transmission was possible, simulcasting on TV and radio was a method of effectively transmitting &quot;stereo&quot; sound to music TV broadcasts. Typically, an FM frequency in the broadcast area for viewers to tune their stereo systems to would be displayed on the screen. The band Grateful Dead and their concert &quot;Great Canadian Train Ride&quot; in 1970 was the first TV broadcast of a live concert with FM simulcast. In the 1970s WPXI in Pittsburgh broadcast a live Boz Scaggs performance which had the audio simultaneously broadcast on two FM radio stations to create a quadrophonic sound, the first of its kind. The first such transmission in the United Kingdom was on 14 November 1972, when the BBC broadcast a live classical concert from the Royal Albert Hall on both BBC2 and Radio 3. The first pop/rock simulcast was almost two years later, a recording of Van Morrison&#x27;s London Rainbow Concert simultaneously on BBC2 TV and Radio 2 (see &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late to Stop Now&quot;) on 27 May 1974.

Similarly, in the 1980s, before Multichannel Television Sound or home theater was commonplace in American households, broadcasters would air a high fidelity version of a television program&#x27;s audio portion over FM stereo simultaneous with the television broadcast. PBS stations were the most likely to use this technique, especially when airing a live concert. It was also a way of allowing MTV and similar music channels to run stereo sound through the cable-TV network. This method required a stereo FM transmitter modulating MTV&#x27;s stereo soundtrack through the cable-TV network, and customers connecting their FM receiver&#x27;s antenna input to the cable-TV outlet. They would then tune the FM receiver to the specified frequency that would be published in documentation supplied by the cable-TV provider.

With the introduction of commercial FM stations in Australia in July 1980, commercial TV channels began simulcasting some music based programs with the new commercial FM stations and continued to do so into the early 1990s. These were initially rock based programs, such as late night music video shows and rock concerts, but later included some major rock musicals such as &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; and &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; when they first aired on TV. During the mid-1980s the final Australian concert of several major rock artists such as Dire Straits were simulcast live on a commercial TV and FM station. The ABC also simulcast some programs on ABC Television and ABC FM, including the final concert of Elton John with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.

In South Africa, the SABC radio station Radio 2000 was established in 1986 to simulcast SABC 1 programming, especially imported American and British television shows, in their original English, before South Africa adopted a stereo standard which allowed secondary audio tracks through the television spectrum.

The first cable TV concert simulcast was Frank Zappa&#x27;s Halloween show (31 October 1981), live from NYC&#x27;s Palladium and shown on MTV with the audio-only portion simulcast over FM&#x27;s new &quot;Starfleet Radio&quot; network. Engineered by Mark G. Pinske with the UMRK mobile recording truck. A later, notable application for simulcasting in this context was the Live Aid benefit concert that was broadcast around the world on 13 July 1985. Most destinations where this concert was broadcast had the concert simulcast by at least one TV network and at least one of the local FM stations.

Most stereo-capable video recorders made through the 1980s and early 1990s had a &quot;simulcast&quot; recording mode where they recorded video signals from the built-in TV tuner and audio signals from the VCR&#x27;s audio line-in connectors. This was to allow one to connect a stereo FM tuner that is tuned to the simulcast frequency to the VCR&#x27;s audio input in order to record the stereo sound of a TV program that would otherwise be recorded in mono. The function was primarily necessary with stereo VCRs that didn&#x27;t have a stereo TV tuner or were operated in areas where stereo TV broadcasting wasn&#x27;t in place. This was typically selected through the user setting the input selector to &quot;Simulcast&quot; or &quot;Radio&quot; mode or, in the case of some JVC units, the user setting another &quot;audio input&quot; switch from &quot;TV&quot; or &quot;Tuner&quot; to &quot;Line&quot;.

In the mid to late 1990s, video game developer Nintendo utilized simulcasting to provide enhanced orchestral scoring and voice-acting for the first ever &quot;integrated radio-games&quot; – its Satellaview video games. Whereas digital game data was broadcast to the Satellaview unit to provide the basic game and game sounds, Nintendo&#x27;s partner, satellite radio company St.GIGA, simultaneously broadcast the musical and vocal portion of the game via radio. These two streams were combined at the Satellaview to provide a unified audiotrack analogous to stereo.

==Other uses==
The term &quot;simulcast&quot; (describing simultaneous radio/television broadcast) was coined in 1948 by a press agent at WCAU-TV, Philadelphia. NBC and CBS had begun broadcasting a few programs both to their established nationwide radio audience and to the much smaller—though steadily-growing—television audience. NBC&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Firestone&quot; is sometimes mentioned in this regard, but NBC&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Firestone Televues&quot; program, reaching a small Eastern audience beginning in 1943, was a TV-only show, distinct from the radio &quot;Voice of Firestone&quot; broadcasts. Actual TV-AM radio simulcasts of the very same &quot;Voice of Firestone&quot; program began only on 5 September 1949. A documented candidate for first true simulcast may well be NBC&#x27;s &quot;We the People.&quot; Toscanini&#x27;s NBC Symphony performance of 15 March 1952 is perhaps a first instance of radio/TV simulcasting of a concert, predating the much-heralded rock concert simulcasts beginning in the 1980s. It could, however, be argued that these Toscanini presentations—with admission controlled by NBC, as with all its programming—were no more &quot;public concerts&quot; than NBC&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Firestone&quot; broadcasts beginning in 1949, or its &quot;Band of America&quot; programs, which were simulcast starting 17 October 1949. Likewise Toscanini&#x27;s simulcast NBC presentation of two acts of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; on 3 April 1949.

Presently, in the United States, simulcast most often refers to the practice of offering the same programming on an FM and AM station owned by the same entity, in order to cut costs. With the advent of solid state AM transmitters and computers, it has become very easy for AM stations to broadcast a different format without additional cost; therefore, simulcast between FM/AM combinations are rarely heard today outside of rural areas, and in urban areas, where often the talk radio, sports radio, or all-news radio format of an AM station is simulcast on FM, mainly for the convenience of listeners in office buildings in urban cores which easily block AM signals, as well as those with FM-only tuners. In another case, popular programs will be aired simultaneously on different services in adjacent countries, such as animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, airing Sunday evenings at 8:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific times) on both Fox in the United States and Global (1989 to 2018) and Citytv (2018 to 2021) in Canada and entertainment show &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, airing Saturday nights at various times between 7:00 pm and 7:30 pm on ITV in the United Kingdom and Virgin Media One in the Republic of Ireland.

During apartheid in South Africa, many foreign programmes on SABC television were dubbed in Afrikaans. The original soundtrack, usually in English, but sometimes in German or Dutch was available on the Radio 2000 service. This could be selected using a button labeled simulcast on many televisions manufactured before 1995.

Radio programs have been simulcast on television since the invention thereof however, as of recent, perhaps the most visible example of radio shows on television is &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, which currently airs on Sirius Satellite Radio as well as Howard TV. Another prominent radio show that was simulcast on television is &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot;, which until the simulcast ended in 2015, aired throughout the years on MSNBC, RFD-TV and Fox Business Network, in addition to its radio broadcast distributed by Citadel Media. Multiple sports talk radio shows, including &quot;Mike &amp; Mike&quot;, &quot;The Herd with Colin Cowherd&quot; and &quot;Boomer and Carton&quot; also are carried on television, saving those networks the burden of having to air encores of sporting events or other paid sports programming which may draw lower audiences. In New Zealand, breakfast programme The AM Show airs on television channel Three and was simulcast on radio station Magic Talk; both networks were owned and operated by MediaWorks New Zealand until December 2020, when Three was sold to Discovery, Inc. In 2022, the programme was rebranded as &quot;AM&quot; and ceased simulcasting on Magic Talk, becoming a TV-only format.

Following the acquisition of the assets of the professional wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) by the rival World Wrestling Federation (WWF), a segment simulcast between their two flagship programs—&quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; on TNT (which was airing its series finale from Panama City) and the WWF&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; on TNN (from Cleveland)—on March 26, 2001, featured WWF owner Vince McMahon addressing the sale, only for his son Shane McMahon to reveal in-universe that he had bought WCW instead, setting up an &quot;Invasion&quot; storyline to begin integrating WCW talent and championships into WWF.

It is not uncommon for broadcasters to simulcast a particular program (such as a marquee event or special) across all of their networks as a &quot;roadblock&quot; in an effort to maximize ratings by preventing self-cannibalizing counterprogramming; for example, Paramount Global (and corporate predecessor Viacom) has simulcast award shows produced by its flagship properties across its cable channels, such as the MTV Video Music Awards and Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards. Certain events—particularly major charity appeals (such as Hope for Haiti Now and Stand Up to Cancer)—may be jointly simulcast by a consortium of networks in order to ensure a wide audience. 

===Simulcasting of sporting events===
In sports, such as American football and baseball, simulcasts are when a single announcer broadcasts play-by-play coverage both over television and radio. The practice was common in the early years of television, but since the 1980s, most teams have used a separate team for television and for radio. In the National Hockey League, two teams currently use a simulcast:
*The Buffalo Sabres, with play-by-play announcer Rick Jeanneret or Dan Dunleavy and analyst Rob Ray via MSG Western New York
*The Dallas Stars, with play-by-play announcer Josh Bogorad and analyst Daryl Reaugh via Bally Sports Southwest
Al McCoy (Phoenix), Chick Hearn (Los Angeles), Kevin Calabro (Seattle) and Rod Hundley (Utah) were the last National Basketball Association team broadcasters to be simulcast. Until his retirement in 2016, the first three innings of Vin Scully&#x27;s commentary for Los Angeles Dodgers home and NL West road games were simulcast on radio and television, with the remainder of the game called by Scully exclusively for television viewers. For the final game before his retirement, Scully&#x27;s commentary was simulcast on the radio for the entirety of the game. 

In the 2021 season, the Toronto Blue Jays broadcast the audio of the Sportsnet play-by-play with Dan Shulman (who has previously been a radio voice for MLB on ESPN Radio) and Buck Martinez over their radio network in what was stated to be a COVID-19-related measure. Media outlets disputed the decision and felt it was actually a cost-cutting move by Blue Jays and Sportsnet owner Rogers Communications, as the team had maintained dedicated radio broadcasts in 2020 with a remote crew.

As all NFL television broadcasts are done by the national networks or via cable, there are no regular TV-to-radio football simulcasts. In order to ensure that all of a particular team&#x27;s games are available on free-to-air television in their home market, NFL rules require that games not aired by a broadcast television network (including cable networks and streaming platforms) be simulcast on a broadcast station in the main market of each participating team.

In greyhound racing and horse racing, a simulcast is a broadcast of a greyhound or horse race which allows wagering at two or more sites; the simulcast often involves the transmission of wagering information to a central site, so that all bettors may bet in the same betting pool, as well as the broadcast of the race, or bet from home as they watch on a network such as TVG Network or the Racetrack Television Network.

The regional sports network MASN previously used simulcasts for MLB games played between the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals—regional rivals who share the same market and broadcaster. MASN and MASN2 simulcast a single feed of the games with a commentary team featuring personalities from both teams, featuring Jim Hunter and Bob Carpenter alternating play-by-play duties, and the teams&#x27; color commentators. This arrangement ended in 2014, with both channels now originating their own Orioles- and Nationals-specific telecasts as normal.

A more recent trend by sports broadcasts have been alternate feeds offering different viewing options, including specialty camera angles, alternative commentary, or enhanced in-game statistics and analysis. In 2021, ESPN introduced a simulcast of selected &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games featuring Eli and Peyton Manning, joined by celebrity guests; the success of these broadcasts prompted ESPN to extend the format to other sports, with the Mannings&#x27; production company Omaha Productions being involved in some of these broadcasts.

=== Distribution of channels ===
On cable television systems, analog-digital simulcasting (ADS) means that analog channels are duplicated as digital subchannels. Digital tuners are programmed to use the digital subchannel instead of the analog. This allows for smaller, cheaper cable boxes by eliminating the analog tuner and some analog circuitry. On DVRs, it eliminates the need for an MPEG encoder to convert the analog signal to digital for recording. The primary advantage is the elimination of interference, and as analog channels are dropped, the ability to put 10 or more SDTV (or two HDTV, or various other combinations) channels in its place. The primary drawback is the common problem of over-compression (quantity over quality) resulting in fuzzy pictures and pixelation. 

Multiplexing—also sometimes called &quot;multicasting&quot;—is something of a reversal of this situation, where multiple program streams are combined into a single broadcast. The two terms are sometimes confused.

In universities with multiple campuses, simulcasting may be used for a single teacher to teach class to students in two or more locations at the same time, using videoconferencing equipment.

In many public safety agencies, simulcast refers to the broadcasting of the same transmission on the same frequency from multiple towers either simultaneously, or offset by a fixed number of microseconds. This allows for a larger coverage area without the need for a large number of channels, resulting in increased spectral efficiency. This comes at the cost of overall poorer voice quality, as multiple sources increase multipath interference significantly, resulting in what is called simulcast distortion.

<text>Charles B. G. Sturridge (born 24 June 1951) is an English director and screenwriter. He is the recipient of a BAFTA Children&#x27;s Award and four BAFTA TV Awards. He has also been nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards.

==Early life and education==
Sturridge was born in London, England, to Alyson P. (née Burke, later Williams) and Jerome F. Sturridge. He was educated at Stonyhurst College and University College, Oxford.

==Career==

Sturridge began his career as an actor. He appeared in &quot;Zigger Zagger&quot; in 1967 with the National Youth Theatre, played Markland in Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;if...&quot; (1968) and portrayed the young Edward VII in &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; (1975). After directing episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot;, &quot;World in Action&quot;, &quot;Crown Court&quot; and &quot;The Spoils of War&quot; by his late twenties, he gained international recognition for his work on the eleven-part television adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; which won over 17 awards including two Golden Globes and six British Academy awards. He scripted a film version of J. G. Farrell&#x27;s &quot;Troubles&quot; made for London Weekend Television in 1988 and directed by Christopher Morahan.

Since then the films Sturridge has directed have included &quot;Runners&quot;, &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot;, &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, based on the Cottingley Fairies story which won the BAFTA for Best Children&#x27;s film 1998. He wrote and directed &quot;Lassie&quot; (2005), a remake of Eric Knight&#x27;s children&#x27;s story. He also directed the black-and-white segment &quot;La Forza del Destino&quot; in the anthology film &quot;Aria&quot; (1987). Other television work includes &quot;Soft Targets&quot; (1982), &quot;A Foreign Field&quot; (1985) and &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1996), which won six Emmys including Best Series and the Royal Television Society&#x27;s Team award.

In 2001, he wrote and directed &quot;Longitude&quot;, based on Dava Sobell&#x27;s best selling life of the clockmaker John Harrison which won the Banff TV Festival Best Series award, two PAWS awards and five BAFTAs. In 2000, he formed Firstsight Films whose first production was an account of Sir Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;Endurance&quot; expedition, which Sturridge wrote and directed. The serial &quot;Shackleton&quot; (2002), which starred Kenneth Branagh, was shot on location in the Arctic. It won the BAFTA for Best Series and Best Costume, and the &quot;Radio Times&quot; Audience award for Best Drama 2002, as well as being nominated for seven Primetime Emmys, winning for music and photography.

Sturridge also contributed to &quot;Beckett on Film&quot;, part of a collaborative effort to film all of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s plays with Anthony Minghella, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, and Neil Jordan and Patricia Rozema. Following Minghella&#x27;s death in 2009, Sturridge became a director for his final project, the television series &quot;The No. 1 Ladies&#x27; Detective Agency&quot;.

In 2010, he returned to Manchester and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; to direct the story of the making of its first episode &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot;. This television film won both the RTS and BAFTA awards for Best Single Drama 2011 and a gold medal at the New York Film and TV Festival in Las Vegas. In 2011, Sturridge directed a seven-minute short film, &quot;Astonish Me&quot;, written by Stephen Poliakoff to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the World Wildlife Fund. The film was shown in Odeon Cinemas in August 2011 and made available on the WWF website and YouTube.

Sturridge&#x27;s first professional theatre production was a musical version of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Hard Times&quot; which he co-wrote and directed at the Belgrade Theatre Coventry; since then, occasional theatre work includes in 1985 &quot;The Seagull&quot; (also co-translator) with Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha Richardson and Jonathan Pryce, and Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Endgame&quot; (2006) with Kenneth Cranham and Peter Dinklage which opened at Dublin&#x27;s Gate Theatre on the centenary of Beckett&#x27;s 100th birthday, and later transferred to the Barbican. He also directed Handel&#x27;s &quot;Tolomeo&quot; (1998) for Broomhill Opera.

In 2007, Sturridge joined the board of the Directors and Producers Rights Society, which, in 2008, widened its responsibilities and changed its name to Directors UK. The DUK currently has over 4,000 members and represents the creative and economic rights of UK film and television directors, with Paul Greengrass as president and Sturridge as the elected chair.

==Personal life==
Sturridge married actress Phoebe Nicholls on 6 July 1985; they have two sons, including actor Tom Sturridge, and a daughter, actor Matilda Sturridge.

<text>The Kakar (Pashto: کاکړ) is a Gharghashti Pashtun tribe, based in Afghanistan, parts of Iran, and northern Balochistan in Pakistan.

==Origins of the tribe==
Kakars are descendants of Dani (or Daani) who was the son of Gharghasht. Gharghasht was the son of Qais Abdul Rashid, the founder of the Pashtuns who himself was the descendant of Afghana (or Avagana) the progenitor of modern-day Pashtuns. 

In Herat, the Kakar are sometimes referred to as Kak. Historically, the tribe has been called Kakar but may have been referred to as Kak-kor (lit. family of Kak). The tomb of Kakar is in front of Herat central Jamia Masjid&#x27;s gate. Some historians argue that Kakar was first buried in Kohistan, but Ghiyath al-Din Ghori brought the body to be re-buried in a mosque in the city of Herat.

==History==

Until the fifteenth century, Kakars along with Tajiks, Baloch and Farsiwans mainly inhabited the Qandahar region and because of the predominant position of Abdali and Ghilzai Pashtuns in Qandahar region during and around 14th century, Tajiks, Hazaras, Kakars and Baloch lost their previous possessions and were forced to pay tax or revenue to warlords from either Abdali or Ghilzai tribal divisions. Eventually, some of these indigenous people assimilated and became part of dominant Pashtun confederacy, while others moved further west or to north Afghanistan. 

Prior to the partition of British India, Hindu members of the Kakar tribe, known as Sheen Khalai, resided in the Qila Abdullah and Qila Saifullah, Quetta, Loralai and Maikhter regions of Baluchistan now in Pakistan.

The Kakar also took part in anti-colonial resistance against the British Indian Army fighting alongside neighbouring Baloch tribes.

After 1947, they migrated to Unniara, Rajasthan and other parts of independent India.

<text>Robert Hersant (; 30 January 1920 – 21 April 1996) was a French newspaper magnate. He was a leader in the pro-Nazi youth movement during the Vichy wartime years, but after prison time built a major newspaper empire and engaged in conservative politics. At the time of his death he operated 40 publications and employed 8,000 people, but failed in his leap into television.

== Early life ==
Hersant was born in Vertou, Loire-Atlantique. . He was the son of a captain in the
merchant navy and showed early on an interest in school newspapers.

==Vichy France==
Initially involved with the Socialist Youth movement in 1935, Robert Hersant founded the rightist political party &quot;Jeune Front&quot; in the summer 1940. During that period, he became a friend of Jean-Marie Balestre. &quot;Jeune Front&quot; although a small group, was publishing the pro-Nazi newspaper &quot;Au Pilori&quot;. He left this movement in October 1940, to become a member of the secretariat general de la jeunesse of the Vichy Regime. In 1941–1942, he created a camp in Brévannes, named after the Marshal Philippe Pétain to indoctrinate young people in the Révolution nationale ideology. He was not affected in the first waves of the Épuration légale after liberation. He was arrested and jailed for one month in Fresnes on 15 June 1945. He was tried in 1947 and sentenced to 10 years of national indignity for collaboration with Nazi Germany. The court emphasized that &quot;Jeune Front&quot; had received support from the Nazis as early as August 1940 to justify that sentence.

==Publishing and politics==
He was released through the general amnesties in 1947, 1951 and 1953. His personal friendships with notable Socialist leaders such as Guy Mollet and François Mitterrand during the 1950s enabled him to start fresh. After launching a few unsuccessful publications, (&quot;Bazars et Galeries&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;Equipement Ménager&quot;, &quot;le Quincailler&quot;), in 1950, he started &quot;L&#x27;Auto-Journal&quot;, which met success due to the increasing popularity of automobiles.

In October 1952, he bought &quot;la semaine de l&#x27;Oise&quot; and used it to launch his political career. In February 1953, he was elected mayor of Ravenel, Oise, and in January 1956 he ran for a deputy seat in the Assemblée Nationale as a radical candidate. He was elected with the support of French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) and Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (UDSR). However, on 18 April 1956 his election caused a heated debate at the Assemblée Nationale due to his collaborationist past. The Assemblée Nationale cancelled his election, but on 25 October 1956 he was reelected. As a deputy, Hersant championed a reform of the constitution of 1946, altering the articles 45, 46, 47, 48 and 52. It would have permitted the direct election of the &quot;Président du Conseil&quot;, and would have obliged him to form his cabinet from personalities that did not belong to legislative bodies.

Hersant advocated a partition of Algeria as a solution to the Algerian War. In 1958, Hersant became Gaullist. In 1967, he was elected as a Radical within the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left. He then became a conservative supporting Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. He remained a deputy until 1978. In 1984, he became a deputy in the European Parliament on the Rally for the Republic–Union for French Democracy (RPR/UDF) list led by Simone Veil. He remained a European Deputy until his death.

He gradually built his empire by buying or creating local or regional newspapers through his holding company &quot;Socpresse&quot; (and its associate &quot;France-Antilles&quot;). In 1957, he created &quot;Centre Presse&quot; and in 1964, &quot;France-Antilles&quot;. Robert Hersant also took control of various regional titles such as &quot;Le Courrier de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;, &quot;Nord Matin&quot; (bought in 1967), &quot;Paris Normandie&quot; (bought in 1972), &quot;Nord Eclair&quot; (bought in 1975, and merged with &quot;Nord Matin&quot;).

In 1975, he purchased from Jean Prouvost the great conservative newspaper &quot;le Figaro&quot; (with the help of Pierre Juillet and Marie-France Garaud, then adviser of Jacques Chirac), in 1976 the popular daily &quot;France-Soir&quot;, and in 1980 acquired &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot; from the estate of Marcel Boussac. At the time, it was rumored that president Giscard d&#x27;Estaing had facilitated the obtaining of loans by Hersant in order to have the three Parisian newspapers (totalling 1.06 million in circulation) controlled by a political ally. In 1979, Hersant launched &quot;Le Figaro-Magazine&quot;, a weekly supplement of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, headed by Louis Pauwels. In 1980, &quot;Le Figaro&quot; absorbed &quot;L&#x27;Aurore&quot;. In 1983, Hersant bought Le Dauphiné Libéré, in 1986, &quot;Le Progrès de Lyon&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;Union de Reims&quot;, and in 1987 &quot;Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes&quot;. As a result, in 1986, according to Daniel Singer, he was controlling 38% of the national press, and 26% of the regional press in France.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hersant extended his activities to eastern Europe. In 1991, he bought &quot;Magyar Nemzet&quot; (Hungary), 51% of Rzeczpospolita (Poland), Tempo, Dziennik Baltycki, Dziennik Lodzki, Trybuna Slaska, Express Ilustrowany, Wieczor Wybrzeza, Dziennik Zachodni and Gazeta Krakowska. This large number of acquisitions gained him the nicknames of &quot;Citizen H&quot; and &quot;Le Papivore&quot; in the satirist &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;.

In 1987, he was involved with Silvio Berlusconi in the launching of the La Cinq TV-channel. He withdrew in 1990 after suffering serious losses. &quot;La Cinq&quot; collapsed in 1992.

Robert Hersant&#x27;s group was, in 1996, employing 8,000 persons, and generating a revenue of 6 billion French francs.

==Death==
He died at Saint-Cloud in 1996. After his death of Hersant, Socpresse was sold to Serge Dassault.

<doc id="572011" wikidata="Q957629" url="?curid=572011" title="The Great Gig in the Sky">
<text>&quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; is the fifth track on &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, a 1973 album by English rock band Pink Floyd. The song features music by keyboard player Richard Wright and improvised, wordless vocals by session singer Clare Torry. It is one of only three Pink Floyd songs to feature lead vocals from an outside artist. &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; was released as a digital single on February 10, 2023, to promote &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon 50th Anniversary&quot; box set.

==Composition==

The song began as a chord progression created by keyboard player Richard Wright, which was known in its early stages as &quot;The Mortality Sequence&quot; or &quot;The Religion Song&quot;.

During the first half of 1972, it was performed live as a simple organ instrumental, accompanied by spoken-word extracts from the Bible and snippets of speeches by Malcolm Muggeridge, a British writer known for his conservative religious views.

By September 1972, the lead instrument had been switched to a piano, with an arrangement very similar to the final form but without vocals, and with a slightly different chord sequence in the middle. Various sound effects were tried over the track, including recordings of NASA astronauts communicating on space missions, but none was satisfactory.

Finally, in January 1973, a couple of weeks before the album was due to be finished, the band thought of asking a female singer to &quot;wail&quot; over the music.

==Clare Torry&#x27;s vocals==
The band began casting around for a singer, and studio engineer Alan Parsons suggested Clare Torry, a 25-year-old songwriter and session vocalist he had worked with on a &quot;Top of The Pops&quot; covers album. Torry was contacted to arrange a session for the same evening but she had other commitments, including tickets to see Chuck Berry, so a three-hour session was scheduled for the next day, Sunday 21 January.
The band played the instrumental track to Torry and asked her to improvise a vocal. At first she struggled to find what was needed, but then she was inspired to sing as if she were an instrument herself. Torry performed two complete takes, the second more emotional than the first, but when David Gilmour asked for a third take she stopped halfway through, feeling that she was becoming repetitive and had already done the best she could. The final album track was assembled from all three takes. The members of the band were deeply impressed by Torry&#x27;s performance but did not tell her this, and she left the studio, with a standard £30 flat fee, under the impression that her vocals would not make the final cut. She only became aware that she had been included in the final mix when she picked up the album at a local record store and saw her name in the credits. In 2005, an undisclosed out-of-court settlement in Torry&#x27;s favour included giving her vocal composition credit.

Chris Thomas, who was brought in to assist Alan Parsons in mixing the album, mentions that they were actually in mixdown at the time. On the DVD &quot;Classic Albums: Pink Floyd – The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, various members mention that they had this song and were not sure what to do with it. Wright recalls that when Torry finished, she was apologetic about her performance, even though those present were amazed at her vocal improvisation.

==Spoken parts==

On &quot;Classic Albums: Pink Floyd – The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, it is stated that during the recording of the album, in which death and life had been a consistent theme, the members of the band went around asking questions and recording responses from people working inside Abbey Road at the time. Among the questions, they were asked &quot;Are you afraid of dying?&quot;. The responses of doorman Gerry O&#x27;Driscoll and the wife of their road manager Peter Watts were used, as well as other spoken parts throughout the album (&quot;I&#x27;ve always been mad&quot;, &quot;That geezer was cruisin&#x27; for a bruisin&quot;).

&quot;(At 0:39)&quot;
&quot;(At 3:33, faintly)&quot;
==Reception==
In a 1973 review of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, Loyd Grossman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; as a track [Pink Floyd] could have &quot;shortened or dispensed with&quot;. Almost forty years later, in a readers&#x27; poll from the same magazine, the track was selected as the second greatest vocal performance of all time behind &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.

==Lawsuit==
In 2004, Clare Torry sued Pink Floyd and EMI for songwriting royalties, on the basis that her contribution to &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; constituted co-authorship with Richard Wright. In 1973, as a session singer, she was paid only the standard Sunday flat studio rate of £30 (). She told Mojo in 1998, &quot;If I&#x27;d known then what I know now, I would have done something about organising copyright or publishing.&quot; In 2005, prior to a hearing in the High Court, an out-of-court settlement was reached, although the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. On all pressings after 2005, the composition is credited to both Richard Wright and Clare Torry.

== Live performances ==
=== Pink Floyd ===
An early incarnation of the song, titled &quot;The Mortality Sequence&quot; and lacking the vocals later contributed by Clare Torry, was performed by Pink Floyd during the 1972 shows of their Dark Side of the Moon Tour. In its final version, &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; was performed live by Pink Floyd from 1973 to 1975, and from 1988 to 1994.

During the band&#x27;s 1974 tours as well as the Wish You Were Here Tour, David Gilmour played both pedal steel guitar and the Hammond organ, allowing Richard Wright to concentrate solely on piano (his keyboards were positioned where he could not play both). Gilmour&#x27;s pedal steel for &quot;Great Gig&quot; was accordingly located beside Wright&#x27;s Hammond. Vocal duties were handled by Venetta Fields and Carlena Williams, both former members of the Blackberries. The 16 November 1974 performance can be found in the &quot;Experience&quot; 2-CD and &quot;Immersion&quot; box set editions of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

Although the studio version of &quot;The Great Gig The Sky&quot; doesn&#x27;t continue directly into &quot;Money&quot; because of the former marking the end of side 1 of the LP, all of the 1970s live versions of this song (including the 1972 work in progress ones) continue into the extended SFX intro of &quot;Money&quot;. However, during the full live recreations of &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; in 1994, &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot; and &quot;Money&quot; were separated from each other as per the studio versions.

Starting with the 1988 leg of the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour, additional touring keyboardist Jon Carin took over the Hammond parts. Up to three singers performed the vocals, each taking different parts of the song. On the &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; video, with footage from June and August 1988, the vocals are shared by Rachel Fury, Durga McBroom and Margret Taylor. Clare Torry performed the song in the Knebworth concert, released in 2021 live album &quot;Live at Knebworth 1990&quot;.

The Division Bell Tour of 1994 featured a version sung by Sam Brown, Durga McBroom and Claudia Fontaine. A recording from the London concerts can be found in the live album &quot;Pulse&quot; (1995). When the Floyd&#x27;s manager, Steve O&#x27;Rourke, died in 2003, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason played &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; and &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; at his funeral. McBroom said Richard Wright liked her version best, and as he had requested, she sang it at Wright&#x27;s funeral.

=== Roger Waters ===
Torry joined Roger Waters to perform the song live during three dates of his K.A.O.S. On the Road concert series in 1987. In the 1999 leg of Waters&#x27; In the Flesh tour, only the piano intro was played between the reprise of &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;.

In the 2006–08 The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour, the album was played in its entirety, with the song being performed by Carol Kenyon. &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; made a return in his Us + Them Tour (2017–18), performed by lead vocalists of American band Lucius Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig. The performance was documented in the concert film and live album &quot;Roger Waters: Us + Them&quot; (2019).

=== David Gilmour ===
The song was occasionally performed in the final legs of his Rattle That Lock Tour, most notably in the Amphitheatre of Pompeii on 7 and 8 July 2016, with Lucita Jules, Louise Clare Marshall and Bryan Chambers sharing the vocals. The Pompeii performance is part of Gilmour&#x27;s &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot; live album and film.

== Commercial re-use ==
A short clip of the song was used in a 1974 TV advertisement for Dole bananas. A re-recorded version was used as the backing music in a UK television advertisement for the analgesic Nurofen in 1990. The band was not involved in this version, but Clare Torry again did the vocal with Rick Wright on keyboards, Neil Conti on drums and Lati Kronlund on bass. Gilmour said he did not approve of its use, but that Wright, as the writer, had the rights.

<text>Chris Barbosa (October 22, 1961 – October 18, 2024) was an American freestyle music producer from New York.

==Career==
===1980s and 1990s===
In 1983, Bronx-born Barbosa served as a reporting DJ for New York&#x27;s WKTU. In this role, the radio station would contact select club and mobile DJs, including Barbosa, to report on popular records, which would then influence the station&#x27;s playlist. Other DJs involved in this process included Ralph Rivera Jr., Nelson Cruz, Frank Forti Jr., and Vin Rivera, all part of the New York City Mixologists Disco Spinners. This system contributed to the success of artists like Twister.

Also in 1983, an executive from Emergency Records named Sergio Cossa signed Barbosa to do production work with the record label. Some of Barbosa&#x27;s musical influences were Arthur Baker and John Robie, the duo that invented electro-funk with their production of Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot;. Later that year, he teamed up with Mark Liggett to produce a vocal version of &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, the instrumental track of &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;. They used a young contemporary R&amp;B background vocalist named Shannon Brenda Greene, later changing her name to simply Shannon. This track was produced differently from the rest of the electro-funk records. It had a more Latin American-based rhythm with a heavy syncopated drum sound than the records produced by Baker and Robie. This style of electro funk was defined as &quot;freestyle music&quot; because of the way it was produced and mixed. Barbosa is widely credited as the genre&#x27;s founder.

In September 1983, the 12-inch single of the song was released. Following the song&#x27;s initial success, Shannon recorded a full-length album of the same name. The Grammy-nominated single received significant airplay on radio stations across the country. The album, released in February 1984, included another hit, &quot;Give Me Tonight&quot; and became the first freestyle album in dance music history. It was eventually certified gold, having sold over 500,000 copies. Both the 12-inch and 7-inch singles also achieved gold certification.

In 1984, Barbosa and Liggett sought out other session singers to lay down tracks on more freestyle songs. These artists included Nolan Thomas on &quot;Yo Little Brother&quot;, Jay Novelle on &quot;If This Ain&#x27;t Love&quot; and Xena on &quot;On the Upside&quot;. Barbosa also played keyboards, programmed sequencers and produced Robin Gibb&#x27;s album, &quot;Secret Agent&quot;.

In 1986, Emergency Records stopped signing new artists, forcing Barbosa and Liggett to launch their own Ligosa Records. The duo immediately signed Monet and George Lamond. In addition, their subsidiary, Ligosa Entertainment produced songs for upcoming freestyle music acts such as Judy Torres (dubbed the &quot;Queen of Freestyle&quot;), Sa-Fire, and Mark Kalfa. Barbosa found chart success in 1990 with Lamond&#x27;s &quot;Bad of the Heart&quot;, which hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 and peaked at No. 25.

In 1995, Barbosa and Liggett dismantled their company and parted ways. Barbosa continued producing for underground artists. In 1999, Shannon invited him back to update her 1980s singles &quot;Let the Music Play&quot; and &quot;Give Me Tonight&quot;.

===2000s and 2010s===
Barbosa was also affiliated with the tape editing scene. Barbosa served as the Director of Multimedia Services at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in New York City from 2006 to 2012. In September 2011, he relocated to Orlando, Florida; he was a remote worker until January 2012.

He volunteered at IEC House of Worship where he was a camera operator, and a producer/master control operator/engineer utilizing a NewTek Tri Caster 855 Live Multi-Camera Video Production system.

Barbosa has been awarded multiple RIAA certified gold, platinum and silver records for various projects as well as an Ampex Golden Reel Award for &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Barbosa was married with two children. His son Brandon is autistic. Barbosa was also involved in various charities and organizations related to autism.

It was announced that Barbosa had died in October 2024.

<text>Pawling station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, located in Pawling, New York.

==History==
Although the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad traversed the Pawling community as early as the late 1840s, the town did not receive a dedicated passenger station until the construction of one by the New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad in 1881. Despite the establishment of a nearby &quot;Wood station&quot; in 1860, the Pawling station became a focal point for the town&#x27;s development and continued to serve passengers following the village&#x27;s incorporation in 1893. The station was one of the stops on the Harlem Line for trains such as the &quot;Berkshire Hills Express&quot;, offering limited-stop service between New York City and destinations in the Berkshires region, including Pittsfield and North Adams, Massachusetts. In 1950, these direct trains were replaced by shuttle transfers.

As with the rest of the Harlem Division, the Pawling station was incorporated into the Penn Central Railroad (PC), following the 1968 merger of the New York Central and Pennsylvania railroads. PC&#x27;s ongoing financial difficulties throughout the 1970s led to the transfer of its commuter services to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which continued operations through the formation of Conrail in 1976. The station&#x27;s ticket office ceased operations on March 11, 1977. Additionally, the station depot was destroyed by fire on November 30, 1984. Presently, the former station serves as the headquarters for the local chamber of commerce.

==Station layout==
The station consists of a four-car-long high-level side platform to the east of the track.

<text>Patterson station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, located in Patterson, New York.

It is the northernmost station on the line in Putnam County, and the first station beyond the end of electrification.

==History==
The New York and Harlem Railroad built their main line through Patterson towards Dover Plains in 1848, when Patterson station opened. NY&amp;H was acquired by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1864 and eventually taken over by the New York Central Railroad. On August 3, 1952, a derailment of milk cars and other freight at the station took place, which resulted in no injuries or deaths, but nevertheless damaged the station and startled the community. As with most of the Harlem Line, the merger of New York Central with Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 transformed the station into a Penn Central Railroad station. Penn Central&#x27;s continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who eventually converted into a Metro-North station in 1983.

==Station layout==
The station consists of a four-car-long high-level side platform to the west of the track.

<doc id="572027" wikidata="Q708521" url="?curid=572027" title="Caran d'Ache">
<text>Emmanuel Poiré (6 November 1858 – 25 February 1909), known by the pseudonym Caran d&#x27;Ache (), was a 19th-century Russian-French satirist and political cartoonist.

While his first work glorified the Napoleonic era, he went on to create &quot;stories without words&quot; and as a contributor to newspapers such as the &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, he is sometimes hailed as one of the precursors of comic strips.

== Name ==
Emmanuel Poiré initially published his illustrations with military themes under the name Caporal Poiré, but later adopted the pseudonym Caran d&#x27;Ache, and it was under this name that his work became well known in France. The pseudonym comes from the Russian word () meaning &#x27;pencil&#x27;, which, attested in Russian from the 16th–17th centuries, is in turn a borrowing from a Turkic language.

When the stationery company Fabrique Genevoise de Crayons Ecridor came under new management in 1924, the company was renamed Caran d&#x27;Ache, after Poiré, with a nod to the pseudonym&#x27;s etymological roots.

== Biography ==

Born in Moscow on 6 November 1858, d&#x27;Ache was the grandson of an Officer-Grenadier in Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée who, wounded during the Battle of Borodino, had stayed behind in Russia. After his grandfather&#x27;s death, he was adopted by a Polish family whose daughter he later married. His younger sister, Maria Poiret, became a famous dancer and actress.

In 1877, he emigrated to France where he gained French citizenship and joined the Army for five years, where he was assigned to design uniforms for the ministry of war. He also contributed to their journal &quot;La Vie militaire&quot; with satirical illustrations, among them some caricatures of the German army.

In 1898 he co-founded the satirical, anti-Dreyfusard weekly magazine &quot;Psst... !&quot; along with fellow artist and designer Jean-Louis Forain. The magazine lasted 85 issues and was made up entirely of editorial cartoons by Caran d&#x27;Ache and Forain, caricaturing society and its scandals from an antisemitic, pro-Army viewpoint.

He died in Paris on 25 February 1909 at the age of 50.

== Works ==

Much of his work was contributed to &quot;La Vie Parisienne&quot;, &quot;Le Figaro illustré&quot;, &quot;La Caricature&quot;, and &quot;Le Chat Noir&quot;. He also issued various albums of sketches and posters, some listed below. and illustrated a good many books, notably Benardaky&#x27;s &quot;Prince Kozakokoff&quot;.
*1880: His first drawings of military caricatures were published in &quot;La Chronique Parisienne&quot;.
*1892: Caran d&#x27;Ache published &quot;Carnet de Chèques&quot; (&quot;Checkbook&quot;) on the Panama Canal Affair.
*1895: He started publishing editorial cartoons (every Monday) in the daily &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, and soon thereafter for the popular weekly &quot;Le Rire&quot;.
* A poster for an «Exposition Russe» in Paris was published in Les Maîtres de l&#x27;Affiche.
*1898: Caran d&#x27;Ache published the cartoon (&quot;A Family Dinner&quot;), highlighting the intense disagreements in French society regarding the Dreyfus Affair. It appeared a month after Émile Zola&#x27;s famous &quot;J&#x27;Accuse&quot;, which inflamed and hardened opinion on both sides.

<text>Southeast station (formerly known as Brewster North station) is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, located in the town of Southeast, New York. It is the northern terminus of the Harlem Line electrified service, and with the exception of rush hour service, passengers heading to stations further north to Wassaic have to transfer here to diesel powered service.

==History==
The current terminal complex opened on December 1, 1980 as a delayed replacement for the Dykeman&#x27;s station, closed over a decade earlier, and took its current name in October 2003.

==Station layout==
The station has one eight-car-long high-level island platform serving trains in both directions. North of the station, the two tracks merge and electrification ends. Just south of the station is Metro-North&#x27;s Southeast Diesel Maintenance Facility.

The extensive parking at the station is fed by a wide, access road known as Independent Way that connects to NY 312 right next to its interchange with Interstate 84, making it very convenient to reach. There is no disabled-accessible parking available at the station, other than for town residents with permits or for a maximum 16-hour metered period. The station traffic has led to the construction of a shopping plaza and Home Depot along the road at the crest of the rise between the exit and the station; it can easily be seen when approaching the exit along I-84 eastbound.

<doc id="572029" wikidata="Q6533551" url="?curid=572029" title="Letter from America">
<text>Letter from America was a weekly fifteen-minute spoken word radio series broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and its predecessor, the Home Service, and around the world through the BBC World Service. From its first edition to its last, it was presented by Alistair Cooke, who would speak of a topical issue in the US, tying together different strands of observation and anecdote and often ending on a humorous or poignant note. The series ran from 24 March 1946 to 20 February 2004, making it the longest-running speech radio programme hosted by one individual.

==History==
&quot;Letter from America&quot; had its origin in &quot;London Letter&quot;, a 15-minute talk for American listeners on life in Britain that Cooke recorded during the 1930s while working as London correspondent for NBC. &quot;London Letter&quot; came to an end when Cooke emigrated to America in 1937, but it was not long before he suggested to the BBC the idea of continuing the idea in reverse. A prototype, &quot;Mainly About Manhattan&quot;, was broadcast intermittently from October 1938, but the idea was shelved with the outbreak of World War II in 1939.

The first &quot;American Letter&quot; was broadcast on 24 March 1946, initially confirmed for only 13 installments, after Cooke had given a one-off talk under that title in the series &quot;Sunday Newsletter&quot; on 25 November 1945. The change of title to &quot;Letter from America&quot; came on 30 September 1949. The series lasted for 2,869 broadcasts over nearly 58 years and gathered an enormous audience, being broadcast not only in Britain and in many other Commonwealth countries, but throughout the world by the BBC World Service.

On 2 March 2004, at the age of 95, following advice from his doctors, Cooke announced his retirement from &quot;Letter from America&quot;; he died less than a month later, on 30 March 2004, at his home in New York City. Five years later, BBC Radio 4 premiered &quot;Americana&quot;, touted as the successor to &quot;Letter from America&quot;, however it lasted less than three years, ending in the autumn of 2011.

== Availability ==
A compilation of the programme&#x27;s transcripts was published in 2004. In 2012, the BBC made over 900 episodes freely available online in full. The BBC also broadcast a documentary by Alvin Hall about &quot;Letter from America&quot;.

In March 2014, the BBC announced it had recovered over 650 lost editions of the programme, recorded by two listeners, Roy Whittaker in Cornwall and David Henderson in Warwickshire.

<text>Brewster station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, located in Brewster, New York, United States.

A sizable amount of the station&#x27;s ridership comes from across the Connecticut state line given the quicker trips, shorter headways, and (outside peak hours) lack of a mid-trip transfer to Grand Central as opposed to taking the Danbury Branch of the New Haven Line. Because of this, Housatonic Area Regional Transit (the Greater Danbury-area mass transit provider) has a route and a shuttle connecting Danbury to Brewster station.

==History==
Railway service in Brewster can be traced as far back as December 31, 1848 when the New York and Harlem Railroad expanded their main line from Croton Falls to Dover Plains stations. Realizing that the NY&amp;H was going to run through the Town of Southeast, Walter and James Brewster constructed passenger and freight stations in 1848, and donated the buildings to the railroad. By 1869 it also served as the terminus of a railroad named the New York and Boston Railroad which eventually became the New York and Putnam Railroad, and by 1881 it was also a terminus for the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad which was eventually acquired by the New York and New England Railroad.

On March 7, 1913, the NY&amp;P officially became the Putnam Division trains of the New York Central Railroad and Brewster served as the terminus of that line up until May 28, 1958 when passenger service was discontinued on the Putnam Division main line. After that point, there remained one Harlem Division train which traveled up the Lake Mahopac Branch to the Mahopac railroad station and continued over Putnam tracks and making stops on upper Putnam stations until arriving at Brewster station. This &quot;around the horn&quot; train lasted until April 2, 1959 when all passenger service on the Putnam Division was terminated.

It was one of the stations on the Harlem Line to serve the &quot;Berkshire Hills Express&quot; and other limited stop trains that went from New York City all the way to Pittsfield, Massachusetts and North Adams, Massachusetts in the Berkshires. Such through trains were replaced by shuttle transfers in 1950.

As with most of the Harlem Line, the merger of New York Central with Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 transformed the station into a Penn Central Railroad station. Penn Central merged with the New Haven Railroad and its affiliates in 1969 giving them control of all lines in the village. Penn Central&#x27;s continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which made it part of Metro-North in 1983.

==Station layout==
The station itself which dates back to 1931, is located next to downtown Brewster, on US 6. Since parking on the nearby streets is extremely limited, a large parking lot slightly uphill from the station serves commuters. Smaller parking lots are located along eastbound US 6 and on a private road named Ellen Avenue, where it is also notable for having a grade crossing right next to the station, like Katonah. Anti-trespass panels are embedded on the ground and within the tracks between the end of the station platform and the crossing.

The station has one four-car-long high-level island platform serving trains in both directions.

<text>Bolinas Lagoon is a tidal estuary, approximately in area, located in the West Marin region of Marin County, California, United States, adjacent to the town of Bolinas. It is a part of the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. In 1974, Aubrey Neasham and William Pritchard wrote in support of Bolinas Lagoon as Drake&#x27;s New Albion landing site.

The lagoon is a back bay of Bolinas Bay on the Pacific coast approximately 15 mi (25 km) northwest of San Francisco. The trough in which the lagoon sits was formed by the San Andreas Fault, which runs directly through it. The lagoon is separated from the main bay by a bay mouth bar, and the sand bar that encloses the lagoon is full of beachgoers and surfers. The unincorporated community of Stinson Beach sits on the bar. State Route 1, the Shoreline Highway, runs along the eastern edge of the lagoon.

Bolinas Lagoon is on the list of wetlands of international importance as defined by the Ramsar Convention for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands. Portions of the lagoon are included in Marin County&#x27;s Bolinas Lagoon Open Space Preserve, and the western shore is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.

The lagoon has a watershed; streams and canyons feeding into it include Audubon Canyon, McKinnan Gulch, Morses Gulch, Picher Canyon, Pike County Gulch, Stinson Gulch, Volunteer Canyon, and Wilkins Gulch. Kent Island is located in the lagoon.

Duxbury Reef State Marine Conservation Area lies offshore from Bolinas. Like an underwater park, this protected marine area helps conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

<doc id="572040" wikidata="Q1003189" url="?curid=572040" title="Coinage Act of 1792">
<text>The Coinage Act of 1792 (also known as the Mint Act; officially: &quot;An act establishing a mint, and regulating the Coins of the United States&quot;), passed by the United States Congress on April 2, 1792, created the United States dollar as the country&#x27;s standard unit of money, established the United States Mint, and regulated the coinage of the United States. This act established the silver dollar as the unit of money in the United States, declared it to be lawful tender, and created a decimal system for U.S. currency.

By the Act, the Mint was to be situated at the seat of government of the United States. The five original officers of the U.S. Mint were a Director, an Assayer, a Chief Coiner, an Engraver, and a Treasurer (not the same as the secretary of the treasury). The Act allowed that one person could perform the functions of Chief Coiner and Engraver. The Assayer, Chief Coiner and Treasurer were required to post a $10,000 bond with the Secretary of the Treasury.

The Act pegged the newly created United States dollar to the value of the widely used Spanish silver dollar, saying it was to have &quot;the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current&quot;.

==History==
Although some of the provisions in the 1792 Coinage Act were adjusted as time went by, the majority of the rules specified in this Act remained in effect for decades. Essentially, it provided the framework for all subsequent coinage design and production. The Act called for an image emblematic of liberty as well as the word &quot;liberty&quot;, and the year of the coinage. It further declared that on the reverse of each gold and silver coin there would also be the representation of an eagle, with the inscription, &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot;. On the reverse of the copper coins, there express the denomination of the coin as one-cent or half-cent. The Act specified the issuing of three gold coins comprising a $10 gold coin called an &quot;eagle&quot;, a $5 coin called a &quot;half eagle&quot;, and a $2.5 coin called a &quot;quarter eagle&quot;. The Act also authorized construction of a mint building in Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s capital at the time. This was the first federal building erected under the United States Constitution. Mint director David Rittenhouse laid the building&#x27;s cornerstone on July 31.

===&quot;An Act to Provide For a Copper Coinage&quot;===
On May 8, 1792, &quot;An Act to Provide For a Copper Coinage&quot; [1 Stat. 283]] was signed into law by President George Washington. It followed the precedent of the Fugio cent of 1787 in establishing the copper cent, from which descends today&#x27;s one-cent piece. The Act also stipulated that &quot;the director of the mint... be authorized to contract for and purchase a quantity of copper, not exceeding one hundred and fifty tons... to be coined at the mint into cents and half-cents... and be paid into the treasury of the United States, thence to issue into circulation.&quot; Furthermore, it said that &quot;no copper coins or pieces whatsoever except the said cents and half-cents, shall pass current as money, or shall be paid, or offered to be paid or received in payment for any debt, demand, claims, matter or thing whatsoever&quot;. It also stated that people caught trying to knowingly pass or receive foreign copper coinage in a transaction will have it confiscated and all parties fined $10.

==Effects==
Merchants and bankers were reluctant to bring silver bullion to the Mint because of the disclosure of the illegal silver standard that was previously in effect. The silver coins produced in 1794 and 1795 honored the official overall weight of the coin (at 416 grains), but employed a 0.900 fine standard instead of the Spanish dollar 0.8924 fine standard as prescribed in the Mint Act of April 2, 1792. Since the overall weight of the coin remained the same, but the purity was increased, each coin had an excess of precious metal content (416 × 0.9 = 374.4 grains; vs. 416 × 0.8924 = 371.2384 grains; thus: 374.4 - 371.2384 = +3.1616 grains); but since the value of the coin was determined by its face value, this excess precious metal was essentially wasted. The most immediate effect of this practice was that depositors ended up paying an additional 3.1616 grains (0.205 grams) of silver bullion (almost 1% extra; 3.1616 / 371.2384 = 0.8%) for every dollar they received. When this became widely known, bullion deposits brought to the mint declined significantly in 1796 and 1797.

==Authorization and free coinage==

The Act authorized production of the following coins:

The coins were to contain the following markings:
*One side was to have an impression emblematic of liberty, with the inscription &quot;Liberty&quot;, and the year of the coinage.
*The reverse side of each of the gold and silver coins was to have the figure or representation of an eagle with the inscription &quot;U S A&quot;.
*The reverse of the copper coins was to have an inscription expressing the denomination.

Images of Liberty would remain a standard part of US coinage through the 19th century and into the early 20th. While European coins typically included a portrait of the reigning monarch, the idea of depicting a real, as opposed to an allegorical, figure was considered unacceptable in the republican United States. The image of Liberty used on US coins generally reflected contemporary standards of female beauty, and was redesigned every few decades to reflect the changing times, although the Seated Liberty image which graced coins starting in 1837 would end up being used for over half a century. Not until the Lincoln cent, issued in 1909 to commemorate the centenary of President Lincoln&#x27;s birth, would a real person be depicted on a US coin.

The Act defined the proportional value of gold and silver as 15 units of pure silver to 1 unit of pure gold. Standard gold was defined as 11 parts pure gold to one part alloy composed of silver and copper. Standard silver was defined as 1485 parts pure silver to 179 parts copper alloy. The Act also specified the dollar as the &quot;money of account&quot; of the United States, and directed that all accounts of the federal government be kept in dollars, &quot;dismes&quot;, cents, and &quot;milles&quot;, a mille being one-tenth of a cent or one-thousandth of a dollar. The silver content of a dollar under this act was almost exactly equal to 1/5 of the silver content of the contemporary British pound sterling, or 4 British shillings.

Under Sec.14, any person could bring gold or silver bullion and have it coined for free or later for a small fee, exchange it immediately for an equivalent value of coin. The paragraph summary states: &quot;Persons may bring gold and silver bullion, to be coined free of expense;&quot;.

Quality control measures were implemented in that from each separate mass of gold or silver used to produce coins, three coins were set aside by the treasurer. Each year on the last Monday in July, under the inspection of the Chief Justice, the Secretary and Comptroller of the Treasury, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, the coins were to be assayed and if the coins did not meet established standards, the officers were disqualified from office. The meetings later became formalized as the United States Assay Commission, which continued meeting until it was disbanded in 1980.

Section 19 of the Act established a penalty of death for debasing the gold or silver coins authorized by the Act, or embezzlement of the metals for those coins, by officers or employees of the mint; this section of the Act apparently remains in effect and would, in theory, continue to apply in the case of &quot;any of the gold or silver coins which shall be struck or coined at the said mint&quot;. (At present the only gold or silver coins struck by the US mint are the American Silver Eagle and the American Gold Eagle coins, some proof coinage at the San Francisco Mint, such as the silver US State Quarters, and much of the Commemorative coinage of the United States.) All other sections of the act have been superseded, as the Coinage Act of 1834 changing the silver-to-gold weight ratio. Various acts have subsequently been passed affecting the amount and type of metal in U.S. coins, so today there is no legal definition of the term &quot;dollar&quot; to be found in any U.S. statute. Current statutes regulating coinage in the United States may be found in Title 31 of the United States Code.

<doc id="572047" wikidata="Q5310920" url="?curid=572047" title="Dublin High School (California)">
<text>Dublin High School is a four-year high school located in the East San Francisco Bay Area. It is one of the two high schools in Dublin, California along with Emerald High School and serves about 3,200 students.

==History==
By the peak of the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, Dublin had established itself as a significant crossroads city in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Murray School District, consisting of the quaint Murray School, was established in 1866 to meet the educational needs of an ever-increasing population. This proved satisfactory until the late 1950s after World War II, when real estate developers chose Dublin as a site for large-scale suburban development. The population subsequently skyrocketed, from 750 to 13,641 by 1970.

The city scrambled to expand the school system, opening and closing several schools within the next few decades. Dublin High School was established amidst this process in 1968—first as the second high school in Pleasanton, California, sharing the campus of Amador Valley High School by means of a staggered schedule for the 1968–69 school year. The school moved to its current campus in Fall 1969. Its first senior class graduated in June 1971. After the incorporation of the City of Dublin in 1982, Dublin High combined with the Murray School District to form the Dublin Unified School District in July 1988.

In organizational meetings during the summer of 1968 in Pleasanton, chaired by the new Dublin Assistant Principal Robert Hagler and attended by a committee of students, the school colors and mascot were proposed and adopted by the student body later that year. Given the school&#x27;s Irish place name, Hagler had suggested that the mascot (the Gael) and colors (red and blue) of nearby Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California might be an appropriate starting point for the discussions, and the committee eventually agreed with Hagler&#x27;s idea, while adding white to the colors. In a gesture of good will, Saint Mary&#x27;s donated athletic gear to the new school&#x27;s athletic department.

=== Modern issues and renovations ===
73.2% of Dublin voters approved a $184 million bond measure in the November 2004 election, which the Dublin Unified School District planned to use in funding various school renovation projects. Dublin High School was the primary beneficiary of the measure, with $120 million dedicated to a complete renewal of the campus (which began in 2008 and was completed in 2015). The renewal included a new 500-seat Center for Performing Arts and Education, a modernization of the 1968 gymnasium, and a new courtyard.

Over time, this too proved insufficient. Dublin&#x27;s population continued to drastically increase in the 21st century, reaching a total of 46,036 by the year 2010. By 2015, the Dublin Unified School District outlined a second comprehensive high school as one of its top priorities—as listed in its Facilities Master Plan—citing a survey showing Dublin High faculty members&#x27; desires for additional classrooms and renovations of old facilities. By September 2020, plans to build and open the new Emerald High School were finalized.

Dublin voters also passed another $99 million bond measure in 2012 to fund the construction of a 47,000 sq. ft. Science and Engineering Building, which was completed in April 2021.

In the meantime, 2017 saw a beginning of protest and outcry from Dublin High teachers, who had struggled with increased class sizes without proper staffing accommodation or financial compensation. As negotiations for appropriate pay raises and contractual improvements stagnated for months, members and supporters of the Dublin Teachers Association (DTA) took to the streets in a candlelight march to the District office, culminating in a series of statements at the ongoing School Board meeting. This was the first of several marches which took place within the next couple years. In March 2019, the DTA threatened to go on strike if negotiations remained stagnant; a tentative agreement including a pay raise and class size limitation was reached in April.

== Academics ==

Dublin High is home to select Academies focusing on specific career paths:

=== Health Science and Medical Technology Academy ===
Dublin High School offers the opportunity for students to gain lab experience in the biomedical field. Students interested in the Pre-Med Track may join the Health Science and Medical Technology Academy, more commonly known as the Biomedical Academy. The academy starts accepting students at the end of 8th grade; selective interviews are held to determine placement. The academy offers classes focused on the intersection between biology and medicine, with an emphasis on lab skills. The academy is closely affiliated with the school&#x27;s HOSA club and offers a mentorship program in the eleventh grade to further career development.

=== Engineering and Design Academy ===
Students also have the opportunity to pursue engineering via the Engineering and Design Academy. This exclusive academy allows students to network with industry professionals and get priority to take a variety of engineering classes. In 2021, a three-floor Science and Engineering finished construction, allowing for expansion of the academy as well as general classes.

=== Culinary Academy ===
There is also a Culinary academy on campus for students to pursue this route. In this academy the main course is Catering, a course that actually caters to venues such as weddings and dinners. Those who take part in the culinary academy for 3 years receive a scholarship of a few hundred dollars upon graduation.

=== Performing Arts Programs ===
Dublin High School offers a few performing arts programs. The Irish Guard Marching Band and Color Guard competes in the Western Band Association (WBA) and Northern California Band Association (NCBA) in the AAAAA Division and has a membership of 147 students as of 2017. The Irish Guard has performed at field show competitions, home football and basketball games, concerts, and community events. The marching band and the off-season concert and jazz bands have performed in Hawaii, Disney World, Canada, Ireland, and Carnegie Hall, among others. The concert band performed at Symphony Center in Chicago in April 2014. In March 2016, the marching band travelled to Ireland to perform in the annual Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Bray. The Director of Bands at Dublin High School is Jack Bainton. Another program that the High school provides is the &quot;String Orchestra&quot; which the Director of Bands leads.

Dublin High also hosts an active Drama department, which offers courses and clubs that culminate in fall plays, spring musicals, student-directed One Acts, and attendance at the annual Lenaea High School Theatre Festival in Folsom, California.

Dublin High also offers three choir programs: concert choir, show choir, and advanced treble choir.

=== The Academic &amp; Resource Center ===
The Academic &amp; Resource Center (often shortened to &quot;the ARC&quot;) serves as the tutoring center, providing access to technology (through Chromebooks), printers, textbooks, school supplies, and one-on-one assistance with curricula. It is located on the second floor of the Science and Engineering Building.

=== Athletics ===
Frequently in use, Dublin High School offers an olympic-scaled track surrounding a state of the ark football field, where a &quot;D&quot; (for Dublin) is engraved in the center of the field. You may also find a 330,000 square foot open-grass field, including two baseball fields and a softball field. The 110,000 square feet of grass in-between these fields are considered multi-use, occasionally hosting football practices and is also where you can find the discus and shotput areas for Track &amp; Field.

== Transportation ==
Dublin High School is served by three different bus routes, most of which take students from Dublin High to East Dublin and back. This service is provided by Wheels, an LAVTA bus service.

The school also has two parking lots, one located on Brighton Drive and one on Village Parkway. In 2021, the Village Parkway parking lot was expanded at the old site of the now-defunct Dublin Swim Center. Student parking is only available to juniors and seniors.

<text>Denis McCullough (24 January 1883 – 11 September 1968) was a prominent Irish nationalist political activist in the early 20th century, who served as President of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) from 1915 to 1916.

==Early career – IRB activist==
McCullough was born at 1 Barrack Street, Belfast, on 24 January 1883, to Daniel McCullough, a publican, and Margaret Magee.

McCullough was a separatist nationalist from an early age. Both his father and grandfather were in the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), as was his brother. When he was 17, his father had him inducted into the IRB at the side door of a pub by a man who seemed to view the ritual as an unpleasant distraction to a night of drinking. The event disillusioned McCullough with the IRB, and he took it upon himself to revitalise the organisation, with assistance from, among others, Bulmer Hobson and Seán Mac Diarmada. The trio founded the Dungannon Clubs as a non-sectarian, republican, separatist organisation (it was later absorbed into Sinn Féin), for recruitment. They worked to remove &quot;armchair republicans&quot; from positions of power. Their cause prospered with the return of veteran Fenian Tom Clarke to Ireland in 1907.

==President of IRB and Easter Rising==
McCullough was elected to fill the vacant seat of the President of the IRB late in 1915, a position he held during the Easter Rising of 1916, though he took no active role in the rising itself. He was not a member of the Military Committee that was responsible for its planning. It is likely that the other members of the three man IRB executive, Clarke and MacDermott (the treasurer and secretary) supported his nomination as president because, as he was isolated in Belfast, he would be in no position to interfere with their plans. Nevertheless, during Holy Week he got word of what was afoot and travelled to Dublin to question Clarke and MacDermott, who avoided him as long as they could. Eventually they informed him of their plans, which he came to support. Although McCullough was an officer of the Irish Volunteers, in charge of 200 men in Belfast, it was decided that Belfast would not take part in the rising, given that the dominance of the Ulster Volunteers in the northeast could lead to sectarian civil war.

McCullough stated in his application for an Irish military pension in 1937 that, &#x27;I brought out my men in Belfast and mobilised them at Coalisland to cooperate with the Tyrone Volunteers in accordance with orders from Pearse and Connolly received by me. Their orders were to bring all available men and arms across Ulster to Connaught to join Mellows there. They were insistent, especially James Connolly, that we were to &quot;fire no shot in Ulster&quot;. I thought these orders were mad ones but determined to carry out orders if possible&#x27;.

McCullough led Volunteers in his area to Dungannon, County Tyrone, from where they would link up with Liam Mellows in Connacht. Although the Volunteer&#x27;s Chief of Staff Eoin MacNeill issued a countermanding order, cancelling orders for the rising, McCullough took 150 Volunteers and Cumman na mBan by train from Belfast to Dungannon, where he found the local volunteers under Patrick McCartan did not want to leave their home area. McCullough therefore decided to return to Belfast. During the abortive Rising, he accidentally shot himself in the hand. He was arrested that week and taken to Richmond Barracks, Dublin. He spent several months interned at Frongoch internment camp and imprisoned in Reading Gaol.

On his release he married Agnes Ryan, a sister of James Ryan, Josephine Ryan and Phyllis Ryan
 and sister-in-law to their husbands Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly and Richard Mulcahy.

It has been argued that as president of the Irish Republican Brotherhood at the time of the Easter Rising, the title President of the Irish Republic was by rights his, and not Patrick Pearse&#x27;s. However, as he had no real role in the planning of the insurrection, and was not in the vicinity of Dublin, where it was clear the leadership would need to be, it is understandable that Pearse was given the title instead. McCullough&#x27;s decision not to fight in the Easter Rising lost him his pre-eminent position among Belfast republicans. One, Sean Cusack, later said that he told McCullough, &quot;we all felt he had, to some extent, let us down&quot;.

==War of Independence and Treaty==
McCullough felt he was sidelined during the Rising, and left the IRB. He was an ordinary volunteer in the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), during which he was arrested and imprisoned by the British several times and held for long periods. He was imprisoned from May 1918 to March 1919 and again from September 1920 to January 1921 and finally from late January to December 1921.

In early 1922 he was sent by Michael Collins to America to liaise between the IRB and its American sister organisation Clan na Gael.

In 1922, he supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty, despite its acceptance of the Partition of Ireland, as a way of keeping the republican movement united and focused on the north. He later said of the split in the southern movement, &quot;while they were making up their minds about the Treaty, their people in the north were being killed day by day. They could not stand up the terror in Ulster unless they had a united organisation behind them&quot;. He was unaware that Michael Collins continued to covertly arm the IRA in Ulster until August 1922, partly to protect nationalists there and partly to try to bring down the Northern Irish state.

After the Treaty, in early 1922 he was sent by George Gavan Duffy to the United States to make contact with Irish republican organisations there. He later settled in Dublin in the new Irish Free State.

==Business and later political career==
McCullough&#x27;s political activity went alongside maintaining and developing an instrument making and retail music business in Belfast&#x27;s Howard Street, generated from his original trade as a piano tuner. F.J. Biggar, the solicitor antiquarian and friend of Roger Casement, encouraged its growth with orders for bagpipes for his boy bands. In time, after he moved to Dublin, this became McCullough Pigott of Suffolk Street and marked the beginning of a highly successful and influential Free State business career. He distinguished himself in forming the New Ireland Assurance Company. A director of Clondalkin Paper Mills, he also had a role in the Irish Army School of Music, and the Gate Theatre. While in the U.S. as Special Commissioner for the Free State (leaving his wife in charge of the music business), McCullough&#x27;s new premises in Dawson Street were destroyed by an Anti-Treaty IRA land mine as a reprisal during the Irish Civil War.

He was an unsuccessful Sinn Féin candidate at the 1918 general election for the Tyrone South constituency. On 20 November 1924, McCullough stood as the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate at a by-election in the Donegal constituency, following the resignation of Cumann na nGaedheal TD Peter Ward. He was elected to the 4th Dáil, but did not stand again at the next general election, held in June 1927.

<text>Stanton Arthur Coblentz (August 24, 1896 – September 6, 1982) was an American writer and poet. He received a Master&#x27;s Degree in English literature and then began publishing poetry during the early 1920s. His first published science fiction was &quot;The Sunken World,&quot; a satire about Atlantis, in &quot;Amazing Stories Quarterly&quot; for July, 1928. The next year, he published his first novel, &quot;The Wonder Stick&quot;. But poetry and history were his greatest strengths. Coblentz tended to write satirically. 
He also wrote books of literary criticism and nonfiction concerning historical subjects. &quot;Adventures of a Freelancer: The Literary Exploits and Autobiography of Stanton A. Coblentz&quot; was published the year after his death.

<text>Mark Clifton (1906–1963) was an American science fiction writer, the co-winner of the second Hugo Award for best novel. He began publishing in May 1952 with the widely anthologized story &quot;What Have I Done?&quot;.

==Series==
About half of his work falls into two series: the &quot;Bossy&quot; series, about a computer with artificial intelligence, was written either alone or in collaboration with Alex Apostolides or Frank Riley; and the &quot;Ralph Kennedy&quot; series, which is more comical, and was written mostly solo, including the novel &quot;When They Come From Space&quot;, although there was one collaboration with Apostolides. Clifton gained his greatest success with his novel &quot;They&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot; (also known as &quot;The Forever Machine&quot;), co-written with Riley, which was serialized in &quot;Astounding&quot; during 1954, and which was awarded the Hugo Award.

==&quot;Star Bright&quot;==
Clifton&#x27;s other most popular short story is &quot;Star Bright,&quot; the first of three appearances in Horace Gold&#x27;s &quot;Galaxy&quot; (July 1952), about a super-intelligent toddler with psychic powers. From Clifton&#x27;s correspondence we know that Gold &quot;editorially savaged&quot; the story, which appeared in severely truncated or altered form. The story has been compared favorably to Kuttner and Moore&#x27;s &quot;Mimsy Were the Borogoves,&quot; which was published in &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine nine years earlier.

==Personal life==
Clifton worked for many years as a personnel manager and interviewed &quot;over 200,000&quot; people according to a personal letter he wrote to Judith Merril, quoted in &quot;The Science Fiction of Mark Clifton&quot;. This experience formed much of Clifton&#x27;s attitude about the delusions people have of themselves, but also the greatness of which they are capable.

==Innovation==
Barry N. Malzberg wrote in &quot;The Science Fiction of Mark Clifton&quot; that &quot;Clifton was an innovator in the early 1950s and such an impressive innovator that his approach has become standard among science fiction writers. He used the common themes of science fiction -- alien invasion, expanding technology, revolution against political theocracy, and space colonization -- but unlike any writer before him, he imposed upon these standard themes the full range of sophisticated psychological insight.&quot;

Clifton&#x27;s fame ebbed quickly, and he received the 2010 Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award for unjust obscurity.

<doc id="572069" wikidata="Q888048" url="?curid=572069" title="Wihtred of Kent">
<text>Wihtred () ( – 23 April 725) was king of Kent from about 690 or 691 until his death. He was a son of Ecgberht I and a brother of Eadric. Wihtred ascended to the throne after a confused period in the 680s, which included a brief conquest of Kent by Cædwalla of Wessex, and subsequent dynastic conflicts. His immediate predecessor was Oswine, who was probably descended from Eadbald, though not through the same line as Wihtred. Shortly after the start of his reign, Wihtred issued a code of laws—the Law of Wihtred—that has been preserved in a manuscript known as the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot;. The laws pay a great deal of attention to the rights of the Church (of the time period), including punishment for irregular marriages and for pagan worship. Wihtred&#x27;s long reign had few incidents recorded in the annals of the day. He was succeeded in 725 by his sons, Æthelberht II, Eadberht I, and Alric.

==Kent in the late seventh century==
The dominant force in late-seventh-century politics south of the River Humber was Wulfhere of Mercia, who reigned from the late 650s to 675. The king of Kent for much of this time was Ecgberht, who died in 673. Ecgberht&#x27;s sons, Eadric and Wihtred, were probably little more than infants, two or three years old, when their father died; Wulfhere was their uncle by virtue of his marriage to Eormenhild, Ecgberht&#x27;s sister. Hlothhere, Ecgberht&#x27;s brother, became king of Kent, but not until about a year later, in 674, and it may be that Wulfhere opposed the accession of Hlothhere and was the effective ruler of Kent during this year-long interregnum.

Eadric raised an army against his uncle and Hlothhere died of wounds sustained in battle in February 685 or possibly 686. Eadric died the following year, and according to Bede, whose &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; is one of the primary sources for this period, the kingdom fell apart into disorder. Cædwalla of Wessex invaded in 686 and established his brother Mul as king there; Cædwalla may have ruled Kent directly for a period when Mul was killed in 687. When Cædwalla departed for Rome in 688, Oswine, who was probably supported by Æthelred of Mercia, took the throne for a time. Oswine lost power in 690, but Swæfheard (son of Sebbi, the king of Essex), who had been a king in Kent for a year or two, remained. There is clear evidence that both Swæfheard and Oswine were kings at the same time, as each witnessed the other&#x27;s charters. It seems that Oswine was king of east Kent, which was usually the position of the dominant king, while Swæfheard was king of west Kent.

==Accession and reign==
Wihtred emerged from this disarray and became king in the early 690s. Bede describes his accession by saying that he was the &quot;rightful&quot; king, and that he &quot;freed the nation from foreign invasion by his devotion and diligence&quot;. Oswine was also of the royal family, and arguably had a claim to the throne; hence it has been suggested that Bede&#x27;s comments here are strongly partisan. Bede&#x27;s correspondent on Kentish affairs was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine&#x27;s) in Canterbury, and these views can almost certainly be ascribed to the Church establishment there.

Two charters provide evidence of Wihtred&#x27;s date of accession. One, dated April 697, indicates Wihtred was then in the sixth year of his rule, so his accession can be dated to some time between April 691 and April 692. Another, dated 17 July 694, is in his fourth regnal year, giving a possible range of July 690 to July 691. The overlap in date ranges gives April to July 691 as the likely date of his accession. Another estimate of the date of Wihtred&#x27;s accession can be made from the duration of his reign, given by Bede as thirty four and a half years. He died on 23 April 725, which would imply an accession date in late 690.

Initially Wihtred ruled alongside Swæfheard. Bede&#x27;s report of the election of Beorhtwald as Archbishop of Canterbury in July 692 mentions that Swæfheard and Wihtred were the kings of Kent, but Swæfheard is not heard of after this date. It appears that by 694 Wihtred was the sole ruler of Kent, though it may also be that his son Æthelberht was a junior king in west Kent during Wihtred&#x27;s reign. Wihtred is thought to have had three wives. His first was called Cynegyth, but a charter of 696 names Æthelburh as the royal consort and co-donor of an estate: the former spouse must have died or been dismissed after a short time. Near the end of his reign, a new wife, Wærburh, attested with her husband and son, Alric.

It was also in 694 that Wihtred made peace with the West Saxon king Ine. Ine&#x27;s predecessor, Cædwalla, had invaded Kent and installed his brother Mul as king, but the Kentishmen had subsequently revolted and burned Mul. Wihtred agreed compensation for the killing, but the amount paid to Ine is uncertain. Most manuscripts of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; record &quot;thirty thousand&quot;, and some specify thirty thousand pounds. If the pounds are equal to sceattas, then this amount is the equal of a king&#x27;s wergild—that is, the legal valuation of a man&#x27;s life, according to his rank. It seems likely that Wihtred ceded some border territory to Ine as part of this settlement.

==Laws==

The earliest Anglo-Saxon law code to survive, which may date from 602 or 603, is that of Æthelberht of Kent, whose reign ended in 616. In the 670s or 680s, a code was issued in the names of Hlothhere and Eadric of Kent. The next kings to issue laws were Ine of Wessex and Wihtred.

The dating of Wihtred&#x27;s and Ine&#x27;s laws is somewhat uncertain, but there is reason to believe that Wihtred&#x27;s laws were issued on 6 September 695, while Ine&#x27;s laws were written in 694 or shortly before. Ine had recently agreed peaceful terms with Wihtred over compensation for the death of Mul, and there are indications that the two rulers collaborated to some degree in producing their laws. In addition to the coincidence of timing, there is one clause that appears in almost identical form in both codes. Another sign of collaboration is that Wihtred&#x27;s laws use &quot;gesith&quot;, a West Saxon term for noble, in place of the Kentish term &quot;eorlcund&quot;. It is possible that Ine and Wihtred issued the law codes as an act of prestige, to re-establish authority after periods of disruption in both kingdoms.

Wihtred&#x27;s laws were issued at &quot;Berghamstyde&quot;; it is not known for certain where this was, but the best candidate is Bearsted, near Maidstone. The laws are primarily concerned with religious affairs; only the last four of its twenty-eight chapters do not deal with ecclesiastical affairs. The first clause of the code gives the Church freedom from taxation. Subsequent clauses specify penalties for irregular marriages, heathen worship, work on the sabbath, and breaking fasts, among other things; and also define how members of each class of society—such as the king, bishops, priests, ceorls, and esnes—can clear themselves by giving an oath. In addition to the focus of the laws themselves, the introduction makes clear the importance of the Church in the legislative process. Bertwald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was present at the assembly which devised the decrees, and so was Gefmund, the Bishop of Rochester; and &quot;every order of the Church of that nation spoke in unanimity with the loyal people&quot;.

The privileges given to the Church are notable: in addition to the freedom from taxation, the oath of a bishop is &quot;incontrovertible&quot;, which places it at the same level as the oath of a king, and the Church receives the same level of compensation for violence done to dependents as does the king. This has led one historian to describe the Church&#x27;s power, less than a century after the original Roman mission landed in Kent, as &quot;all but co-ordinate with the king himself in the Kentish state&quot;, and it has also been described as presupposing &quot;a frightening degree of royal power&quot;. However, the presence of clauses that provide penalties for any of Wihtred&#x27;s subjects who &quot;sacrifice to devils&quot; makes it clear that although Christianity was dominant, the older pagan beliefs of the population had by no means died out completely.

Clause 21 of the code specifies that a ceorl must find three men of his own class to be his &quot;oath-helpers&quot;. An oath-helper would swear an oath on behalf of an accused man, to clear him from the suspicion of the crime. The laws of Ine were more stringent than this, requiring that a high-ranking person must be found to be an oath-helper for everyone, no matter what class they were from. The two laws taken together imply a significant weakening of an earlier state in which a man&#x27;s kin were legally responsible for him.

==Death and succession==
On his death, Wihtred left Kent to his three sons: Æthelberht II, Eadberht I, and Alric. The chronology of the reigns following Wihtred is unclear, although there is evidence of both an Æthelbert and at least one Eadbert in the following years. After Wihtred&#x27;s death, and the departure of Ine of Wessex for Rome the following year, Æthelbald of Mercia became the dominant power in the south of England.

<text>Marquess of Crewe was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1911 for the Liberal statesman Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Earl of Crewe. He had already been created Earl of Crewe, of Crewe, Cheshire, in 1895, and was made Earl of Madeley, in Staffordshire, at the same time as he was granted the marquessate. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Crewe was the only son of the noted Victorian literary personage Richard Monckton Milnes. The latter had been raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Houghton, of Great Houghton in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1863. Lord Houghton married the Honourable Annabella Crewe, daughter of John Crewe, 2nd Baron Crewe (see Baron Crewe). Their son, the second Baron, succeeded to the Crewe estates on the death of his maternal uncle Hungerford Crewe, 3rd Baron Crewe, in 1894. Lord Crewe&#x27;s two sons both predeceased him and the titles became extinct on his death in 1945.

Richard Slater Milnes, grandfather of the first Baron, was Member of Parliament for the York. Robert Pemberton Milnes, father of the first Baron, was Member of Parliament for Pontefract. Lady Celia Hermione Crewe-Milnes, daughter of the first Marquess, married Sir Edward Clive Coates, 2nd Baronet. In 1946, she and her husband assumed by deed poll the additional surname of Milnes (see Milnes Coates baronets). Richard Milnes, great-great-grandfather of the first Baron, was the uncle of Sir Robert Milnes, 1st Baronet (see Milnes baronets).

<text>Cistus (from the Greek &quot;kistos&quot;) is a genus of flowering plants in the rockrose family Cistaceae, containing about 20 species (Ellul &quot;et al.&quot; 2002). They are perennial shrubs found on dry or rocky soils throughout the Mediterranean region, from Morocco, Spain, Italy, Greece, through to the Middle East, and also on the Canary Islands.

&quot;Cistus&quot;, with its many hybrids and cultivars, is commonly encountered as a garden flower.

The common name rockrose (rock rose in the UK) is applied to the species, a name also shared by the related genera &quot;Helianthemum&quot; and &quot;Tuberaria&quot;, all in the family Cistaceae. The common name &quot;gum cistus&quot; is applied to resin-bearing species, especially &quot;C. ladanifer&quot;.

==Description==

The leaves are evergreen, opposite, simple, usually slightly rough-surfaced, 2–8 cm long. In a few species (notably &quot;C. ladanifer&quot;), the leaves are coated with a highly aromatic resin called labdanum. 

They have showy 5-petaled flowers ranging from white to purple and dark pink, in a few species with a conspicuous dark red spot at the base of each petal.

==Taxonomy==

===Phylogeny===
&quot;Cistus&quot; and &quot;Halimium&quot; form a cohesive and the most derived clade within Cistaceae. Plants of the World Online and World Flora Online treat &quot;Halimium&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Cistus&quot;. Molecular phylogenetic analyses conducted between 2005 and 2011 confirm that &quot;Cistus&quot; species divide into two well-defined clades, neither of which was fully resolved internally. The first clade consists of those with purple and pink flowers (the &quot;purple pink clade&quot; or PPC). The second clade consists of those with white flowers or, in the case of &quot;Cistus parviflorus&quot;, pale pink flowers (the &quot;white or whitish pink clade&quot; or WWPC). Although the flower colour of &quot;C. parviflorus&quot; is anomalous, it has very short styles, otherwise characteristic of WWPC species. A hybrid origin has been suggested. A simplified cladogram is shown below:

Within the purple pink clade (PPC), &quot;C. crispus&quot; is consistently the first diverging species. &quot;C. albidus&quot;, &quot;C. creticus&quot; and &quot;C. heterophyllus&quot; form a well supported clade. Seven species endemic to the Canary Islands form a polytomy, resolved differently in different analyses, in which subtaxa of some species do not always cluster together. Within the white and whitish pink clade (WWPC), there is weak support for a clade consisting of &quot;C. clusii&quot; and &quot;C. munbyi&quot;; the other species either formed part of a polytomy or resolved differently in different analyses. &quot;Halimium&quot; and &quot;Cistus&quot; were regularly shown to be paraphyletic with respect to one another.

==Ecology==
They are thermophilous plants, which require open, sunny places. This plant genus is peculiar in that it has developed a range of specific adaptations to resist summer drought and frequent disturbance events, such as fire and grazing. In addition, it can form both ectomycorrhizas and arbuscular mycorrhizas. More than 200 ectomycorrhiza-forming fungal species belonging to 40 genera have been reported so far to be associated with &quot;Cistus&quot;. As with many other Cistaceae, the species of &quot;Cistus&quot; have the ability to form mycorrhizal associations with truffles (&quot;Tuber&quot;) and are thus able to thrive on poor sandy soils or rocks. &quot;Cistus ladanifer&quot; has been found to have mycorrhizal associations with &quot;Boletus edulis&quot;, &quot;Boletus rhodoxanthus&quot;, and &quot;Laccaria laccata&quot;.

&quot;Cistus&quot; are the only host of &quot;Cytinus hypocistis&quot;, a small parasitic plant that lives on the roots and is noticeable only for a short period of time when in flower. The presence of the parasite does not seem to harm the host population.

&quot;Cistus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Coleophora confluella&quot; and &quot;Coleophora helianthemella&quot;, the latter recorded on &quot;Cistus monspeliensis&quot;.

Various &quot;Cistus&quot; species are known to emit volatile oils, rendering the plants flammable. Their emission of these essential oils is a genetic adaptation for the species intended to actually promote flammability and even cause spontaneous combustion. &quot;Cistus&quot; plants are therefore considered pyrophytes, or plants which rely upon fire as a part of their life cycle to encourage spread within their biome. &quot;Cistus&quot; seeds are resistant to the fires allowing them to germinate once fires have subsided and allowing them to benefit from an environment with less competition from other species.

==Cultivation==
Cistuses are suitable for sunny gardens with a nearly frost-free Mediterranean climate. The hardiest of the species is &quot;C. laurifolius&quot;, which survived the hard frost at Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew in 1895 that eliminated all the cistuses save this and two white-flowered natural hybrids, &quot;C.&quot; × &quot;corbariensis&quot;, already grown by John Tradescant the Elder, and &quot;C.&quot; × &quot;loretii&quot;, a 19th-century introduction.

<text>The BBC Home Service was a national and regional radio station that broadcast from 1939 until 1967, when it was replaced by BBC Radio 4.

==History==
===1922–1939: Interwar period===
Between the early 1920s and the outbreak of World War II, the BBC developed two nationwide radio stations – the National Programme and the Regional Programme (which began broadcasting on 9 March 1930) – as well as a basic service from London that include programming originated in six regions. Although the programme items attracting the greatest number of listeners tended to appear on the National, they were each designed to appeal &quot;across the board&quot; to a single but variegated audience by offering at most times of the day a choice of programme type rather than simply catering to two distinct audiences.

===1939–1940: Start of World War II===
On 1 September 1939, the BBC merged the two programmes into one national service from London. The reasons given included the need to prevent enemy aircraft from using differentiated output from the Regional Programme&#x27;s transmitters as navigational beacons. To this end, the former regional transmitters were synchronised in chains on (initially) two frequencies, 668 (South) and 767 kHz (North), with an additional chain of low-powered transmitters (known as &quot;Group H&quot;) on 1474 kHz appearing later. Under this arrangement, regional broadcasting in its pre-war form was no longer feasible, but much of the programming was gradually decentralised to the former regional studios because of the risks from enemy attack or bombing in London to broadcasting nationally.

This new station was named the &quot;Home Service&quot;, which was also the internal designation at the BBC for domestic radio broadcasting (the organisation had also both the Television and Overseas Service departments). During the war, BBC Home Service would air each day from 7.00 am until 12.15 am, with main news bulletins airing at 7.00 am, 8.00 am, 1.00 pm, 6.00 pm, 9.00 pm and midnight.

The Home Service continued in this form until the end of World War II.

===1945–1967: Post-war era===

On 29 July 1945, the BBC resumed its previous regional structure. Following the wartime success of the BBC Forces Programme and BBC General Forces Programme, light entertainment was transferred to the new BBC Light Programme, whilst &quot;serious&quot; programming – news, drama and discussion – remained on the regionalised Home Service. Popular light programming such as &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; remained on the Home Service, and some speech programming of the type pioneered by the Forces Programme – the newly launched &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; being very much in this mould – was on the Light Programme.

Following the end of the war, the Home Service adjusted its broadcasting hours, now commencing at 6.25 am each weekday and 7.50 am on Sundays, and ending at around 11.10 pm each night. By 1964, the Home Service was on the air each day from 6.35 am (7.50 am on Sundays) and would conclude each night at the precise time of 11.48 pm.

On 30 September 1967, the BBC split the Light Programme into separate pop music and entertainment stations, becoming BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2 respectively. The Third Programme became BBC Radio 3, with the Music Programme losing its separate identities (the Third, Study Session and Sports Service were retained under the banner of Network Three until 4 April 1970), and the Home Service was replaced by BBC Radio 4.

==Programming==
The service provided between five and seven national news bulletins a day from London – with drama, talks and informational programmes. Non-topical talk programmes and heavier drama output were transferred to the Third Programme when it began broadcasting on 29 September 1946.

===Music and schools===
During the day, the service also included programmes of classical music. These were reduced in number when government limits on radio broadcasting hours were relaxed in 1964, and the Music Programme began broadcasting during the daytime on the frequencies of the (evening-only) Third Programme. They were discontinued when regular broadcasting began daily from 7.00 am to 6.30 pm on 22 March 1965.

The service also broadcast educational programmes for schools during the day, backed with booklets and support material.

===Reorganisation===
Programmes were reorganised across the three BBC networks on 30 September 1957, with much of the Home Service&#x27;s lighter content transferring to the BBC Light Programme and the establishment of the Third Network, which used the frequencies of the Third Programme to carry the Home Service&#x27;s adult education content known as the Study Session, and the Home and Light&#x27;s sports coverage as well as the Third Programme itself.

==Regional services==
The BBC Home Service had seven different regions, within London and South East England was served by the &quot;basic&quot; service, which was not considered a region by the BBC and acted as the sustaining service for the other regions:
A shortage of frequencies meant that the Northern Ireland Home Service was treated as part of the North Home Service, as well as the Northern Ireland service used the same frequency as a North service booster. The Northern Ireland service was separated from the North region on 7 January 1963.

Initially, BBC Radio 4 continued to provide more regional programming and scheduling, and the BBC&#x27;s weekly programme journal magazine &quot;Radio Times&quot; listed the channel&#x27;s offerings under the heading &quot;Radio 4 – Home Service&quot; with particular reference to the seven broadcasting regions individually.

===Legacy===
With the introduction of BBC Local Radio, starting with BBC Radio Leicester on 8 November 1967, it was felt that the future of non-national broadcasting lay in local rather than regional services. The BBC produced a report called &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot; on 10 July 1969, proposing the reorganisation of programmes on the national networks and the end of regional broadcasting.

The report began to be implemented on 4 April 1970 and the Home Service regions gradually disappeared, with some of their frequencies reallocated to Independent Local Radio, until 23 November 1978 when Radio 4 was given the national longwave frequency previously used by Radio 2 and was relaunched as the &quot;Radio 4 UK&quot; service (remained until 29 September 1984), with two additional transmitters opened in Scotland.

====English news bulletins====
Radio 4 FM continued to carry four daily five-minute regional news bulletins on Mondays to Saturdays until mid-1980, by which time BBC Local Radio had reached most areas of England. The wide coverage of the Holme Moss transmitter meant that listeners in much of Northern England received combined North and North West news bulletins.

====National and other regions====
The &quot;national regions&quot; became BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Radio Wales / BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Radio Ulster, at first relaying the majority of Radio 4 programming but later becoming completely independent.

During the 1970s, Radio 4 FM in the East of England (Tacolneston, Peterborough and other relays) carried a breakfast magazine programme called &quot;Roundabout East Anglia&quot; was first broadcast on 5 August 1974 as the region lacked any BBC Local Radio until the service ceased on 30 May 1980, ahead of the opening of BBC Radio Norfolk four months later. The last former Home Service region for the South West England was an VHF/FM opt-out of Radio 4, &quot;Morning Sou&#x27;West&quot; was also carried on several low-power medium wave transmitters before the programme ended on 31 December 1982, to paving the way for two new local stations (BBC Radio Devon and BBC Radio Cornwall) launched on 17 January 1983.

<text>Guilford is an unincorporated community located in Howard County in the state of Maryland. The location is named after the Guilford Mill. Guilford is near Kings Contrivance, one of the nine &quot;villages&quot; of Columbia.

For United States Census Bureau statistics, Guilford is split between the census-designated places of Savage and Columbia.

==History==
The area around Guilford was settled before it was called by the name of its mill. In 1711, the Log Chapel of Ease, now called Christ Church Guilford, was founded to the north of Guilford on a piece of land surveyed as &quot;New Year&#x27;s Gift&quot; by Charles Carroll of Carrollton. The first full-time rector was James Magill, who lived at Athol. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Guilford Mill (later called Gary Mill) was situated on the northern branch of the Patuxent River, known as the Little Patuxent River. The mill may have been in operation as early as 1743, and one is documented to have been in operation by 1761 when the area was still part of Northwestern Anne Arundell County. Charles Alexander Warfield and Elizabeth Ridgley built a joint mill on land patented as &quot;Wincopin Neck&quot;. Gristmill operations were underway by 1760. Later owners of the factory included Richard Ridgley. By 1792 the site consisted of a gristmill, sawmill, blacksmith and a stable. By 1881 the mill was managed by James S Gary and Son producing cotton with 50 looms. On August 15, 1890 a fire destroyed the mill collapsing the stone walls of the three and a half story tall building.

Around 1834, a granite quarry was started, quarrying what is now known as the Guilford Quartz Monzonite. Just north of the quarry, Charles Worthington built a stone home with walls two feet thick named &quot;Moundview&quot; that would stand until 1990 when the South Columbia Baptist Church was built on its site. By 1860, Henry A. Penny built a house onsite in 1860 and worked as a hauler. He would become county commissioner in the early 1900s. From 1863 to 1890, when slave labor was unavailable, the quarries were mostly stagnant.

On December 31, 1874 the Guilford Post office opened and remained in operation until June 30, 1920. In 1876, Guilford School opens on Guilford and Oakland Mills roads, and Guilford Colored School opens on land given by Williams, Clark and Rodgers near Guilford and Mission roads.

As the quarry started production again, it was known as one of the best paying jobs for African American laborers, who were not allowed to work in the nearby town of Savage. Many laborers from out of town would stay in a hotel for workers and get supplies from the company store. In 1901, the Maryland Granite Company purchased the quarry, followed by spur line construction between Savage and Guilford in 1902. The steel Pratt truss bridge crossing the Little Patuxent built that year remains onsite today. By 1905 Guilford Road was macadamized with loads being pulled by six-horse teams. During this time, the quarry was now operated by the Granite Company of Baltimore. A community with two churches and two dozen buildings was formed around the present Guilford and Oakland Mills road intersections.

The First Baptist Church of Guilford was formed by Reverend Willis Carter in a tenant house and has since grown to its fourth new building.

By 1908 the large quarry was 100 feet deep producing monument stone and building stone. The smaller quarry to the southeast owned by the Guilford and Watersville Granite company operated from 1887 to 1893. The town joint mill ran as a cotton factory that operated from 1895 to 1916.

By 1908 operations ceased at the Guilford Granite and Stone Company Quarry on the western river bank, and the Penny Quarry, which was later filled in for an office complex. In February 1928 the B&amp;O discontinued its Patuxent rail spur service downstream to Savage, Maryland.

In 1954 the 11 room Guilford Colored School was built, and remains in operation as Howard County&#x27;s oldest formerly segregated school.

From 1963 to 1966, the Rouse Company worked with family members of the County Commissioner to purchase 14,000 acres of Howard County farms using multiple shell companies. The properties around Guilford were bought by Howard Research and Development and 95-32LLC.

==Present Guilford==
In a 1900s accounting of the Guilford Factory site, author Joshua Dorsey Warfeild accounts of &quot;enduring stone homes made of Granite found there, they will stand for centuries&quot;. A 1978 survey of the property performed prior to additional development stated that the buildings were in use until the 1950s, but were &quot;demolished long ago&quot; without explanation. A 2004 survey conducted by the construction firm KCI Technologies contained few specific details of the removal of the historic structures, but concluded that 20 years of continued development &quot;Guilford industrial complex has been extensively compromised by new construction, and, therefore, lacks the integrity required for listing in the National Register&quot; 

Modern Guilford Road spans from southeastern Columbia, through Savage and Annapolis Junction to Fort Meade. The road is bisected by modern route 29, 32, I-95, and 295, leaving a mix of historical original road and newly aligned roads. The road crosses between the most heavily populated sections of the county, reminding residents of a place that is still there, but claimed as part of Savage and marketed as Columbia. The towns of Simpsonville (Columbia), Waterloo (Jessup), Magnolia (Jessup), and Pierceland (Annapolis Junction) have been taken over by their larger counterparts as well.

Of the three large remaining farms that occupied Wincopian Neck, Overlook Farm and Fairlands remain well preserved, but the 124 acre Ponsettia producing Wincopia Farms was purchased for development after Gourley and Gourley LLC foreclosed on a $3 million high interest sustainment loan reselling the property for $41 million to build 220 homes on the site.

==Education==
The Guilford area currently is home to one public school, Guilford Elementary School on Oakland Mills Road in Columbia. Future plans call for a new elementary school to be built on land adjacent to the Savage Stone Quarry in between Washington Boulevard and Mission Road. In 2023, the new Guilford Park High School opened on the land adjacent to the Savage Stone Quarry.

<text>Drakes Estero is an expansive estuary in the Point Reyes National Seashore of Marin County on the Pacific coast of northern California in the United States, approximately northwest of San Francisco.

==Location and description==
Situated at , the estuary provides the main drainage for the Point Reyes peninsula. Seen from the air, Drakes Estero resembles a human hand, with Barries Bay, Creamery Bay, Schooner Bay, and Home Bay as the &quot;fingers&quot; and Limantour Bay as the thumb. The waters of the Estero flow into Drakes Bay between Drakes Beach and a narrow strip of land called Limantour Spit.

==Conservation protections==
Drakes Estero is a congressionally designated &quot;potential wilderness area&quot;. Although Drakes Estero is protected as part of the National Seashore, legacy agricultural uses such as dairy farms and oyster aquaculture have led to controversy over the water quality, conservation status, and proper uses of this body of water.

Conservationists, including L. Martin Griffin, Jr. and oceanographer Sylvia Earle called for an end to the ongoing oyster farming in the estero. Senator Dianne Feinstein criticized the National Park Service, alleging that data used to support the non-renewal was flawed.
On November 29, 2012, United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar directed the National Park Service to allow the permit for oyster farming to expire, allowing the land and waters of the estero to return to their natural state.

A lawsuit was filed on December 4, 2012, by Kevin Lunny, the owner of Drakes Bay Oyster Company, to declare the decision by Salazar null and void. In February 2013, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction on the order to close Drakes Bay Oyster Company until it heard the company&#x27;s appeal. However, on January 14, 2014, the court declined to rehear the case. The final court challenge to the order to remove the oyster farming was dropped in early December 2014, with the removal of the operation completed in May 2017.

==History==
Drakes Estero, the landing spot of Francis Drake on the coast of North America in 1579 during his circumnavigation of the world is a National Historic Landmark. A historical marker has been placed on Drakes Beach near the Kenneth C. Patrick Visitor Center and monuments to Drake have been erected at the Drake&#x27;s Cove landing site. The Drake landing is interpreted at the Kenneth C. Patrick Visitor Center and the Point Reyes National Seashore&#x27;s Bear Valley Visitor Center.

Drakes Estero is a component of the Phillip Burton Wilderness.

<text>Richard Vance Maxfield (February 2, 1927 – June 27, 1969) was a composer of instrumental, electroacoustic, and electronic music.

Born in Seattle, Maxfield studied at Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley (with Roger Sessions) and privately with Ernst Krenek in Los Angeles. A Hertz Prize travel scholarship allowed Maxfield to travel to Europe, where he met Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Luigi Nono. In 1953 he studied at Tanglewood with Aaron Copland. In 1954-55 he studied at Princeton University with Sessions and his pupil Milton Babbitt. A Fulbright Scholarship allowed Maxfield to live in Europe between 1955 and 1957, where he studied with Luigi Dallapiccola and Bruno Maderna, lived for a brief period with Hans Werner Henze and met John Cage and David Tudor. In 1958, he attended Cage&#x27;s courses at the New School for Social Research (now The New School). In 1959 he taught classes there himself, becoming the first American to teach purely electronic music (as opposed to electroacoustic music based on musique concrète-style recordings with microphones). 

As a student at University of California and in Europe in the 1950s, he composed instrumental scores in a neoclassical style and then adopted 12-tone techniques. It is however techniques for composing with magnetic tape that would prove decisive in the development of Maxfield&#x27;s mature compositions. Among his innovations with tape music were the simultaneous performance of improvised instrumental solos with tapes based upon samples of the same soloist, re-editing of tapes before each public performance so that the pieces were not fixed in a single form, and the use of the erase head of the tape machine as a sound source. 

In early 1961, Maxfield and La Monte Young co-curated proto-Fluxus events at Yoko Ono&#x27;s loft. Maxfield was also a friend of Terry Riley and participated in the publication Young and Jackson Mac Low&#x27;s &quot;An Anthology of Chance Operations&quot; in 1963. In 1967, Maxfield left his tape music, scores and equipment in the care of artist friend Walter de Maria. He moved to San Francisco, where he taught at San Francisco State College (1966–67). In 1969, he moved to Los Angeles. On June 27, 1969, Maxfield committed suicide in LA by jumping out a window of the Figueroa Hotel at the age of 42. 

The MELA Foundation currently maintains the archive of Maxfield&#x27;s works.

In 2017, art historian Gerald Hartnett finished a doctoral dissertation on Maxfield at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. Hartnett places Maxfield as a crucial contributor to the experimental art and music of the late 1950s and early 1960s, placing him in the context of Guy Debord, William Burroughs, and Samuel Beckett. Hartnett wrote about &quot;...experimental, time-based, and technologically reproducible art objects produced between 1954 and 1964 to represent &#x27;the real&#x27;... [in which] ...vectors of influence between art and the cybernetic and computational sciences...responded to technological reproducibility in three ways. First of all, writers Guy Debord and William Burroughs reinvented appropriation art practice as a means of critiquing retrograde mass media entertainments and reportage. Second, Western art music composer Richard Maxfield mobilized chance techniques and indeterminacy to resist scientific and philosophical determinism’s pervasive influences upon post-1945 art and life. Third, author and playwright Samuel Beckett conjectured that ubiquitous recording might become problematic to the quality of experiential life in technologically mediated environments.&quot;

<text>John Herbert Turner (May 7, 1834 – December 9, 1923) was a British Columbia politician. Born in Claydon, Suffolk, England, Turner moved to British North America and worked as a merchant in Halifax and Charlottetown. In 1862 he moved to Victoria, on Vancouver Island, and founded Turner, Beeton and Co., which was involved in salmon canning, insurance and finance, importing and wholesaling.

Turner entered politics serving as mayor of Victoria from 1876 to 1881 and entered the provincial legislature in 1886 in the constituency of Victoria City. He served as minister of finance under successive premiers from 1887 to 1895 and as the 11th premier of British Columbia from 1895 to 1898. From 1901 to 1915 he was the province&#x27;s representative in London where he retired. He died in Richmond in 1923.

<text>Point Reyes ( , meaning &#x27;Cape of the Kings&#x27;) is a prominent landform and popular tourist destination on the Pacific coast of Marin County in Northern California. It is approximately west-northwest of San Francisco. The term is often applied to the Point Reyes Peninsula, the region bounded by Tomales Bay on the northeast and Bolinas Lagoon on the southeast. The majority of the peninsula as well as the headlands are protected as part of Point Reyes National Seashore.

==Overview==
The cape protects Drakes Bay on its southern side. The headland is largely drained by Drakes Estero. Drakes Bay and Drake&#x27;s Estero are named after English seafarer Sir Francis Drake who possibly hauled his ship, the &quot;Golden Hinde&quot;, up onto the beach for repairs in June 1579. Inverness Ridge runs along the peninsula&#x27;s northwest-southeast spine, with forested peaks around . West of the ridge, the land flattens out and the vegetation turns to scrub. The Mount Vision fire in 1995 burned part of Inverness Ridge, as well as the Woodward fire in 2020.

Point Reyes lends its name to the town of Point Reyes Station.

The point may once have been known as &quot;Lobes Lighthouse&quot; by the sailors of clipper ships on the meat trade. (Lobes are ridges of slide material commonly referred to in the literature from erosion events and the point is of that shape out to sea.)

==History==
===The Coast Miwok===
The contemporary inhabitants of the Point Reyes area at the time of European arrival were the Coast Miwok. They left evidence of well over a hundred encampments on the peninsula, with a population estimated to have been nearly 3,000. Seasonal hunters and gatherers, they were nourished by fish, clams, mussels, and crab, in addition to the deer, elk, bear, mud hen, geese, and small game they hunted with spears and bows. The Coast Miwok utilized a variety of different plants growing at Point Reyes. Acorns served as a staple, as they could be stored in dry granaries to provide sustenance when food was less plentiful.

Although the Coast Miwok periodically interacted with European explorers, they continued their habitation until late in the 18th century when the Spanish built Mission San Rafael and missionaries began journeying to Point Reyes to recruit them to move to the mission. While attempting to convert them, these missionaries introduced diseases that brought many deaths, fewer births, and significantly increasing infant mortality rates.

In 1992, Coast Miwok descendants established the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, and in December 2000, legislation passed granting the tribe federal recognition. The tribe has almost 500 members, who engage in a revival of traditional customs and ceremonies, often held in &quot;Kule Loklo,&quot; &quot;Valley of the Bear&quot;, a replica Miwok village in Point Reyes National Seashore.

===Early Spanish exploration, 1542-1603===

On November 13, 1542, Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo sighted and named &quot;Cabo de Pinos&quot; (Point Reyes), but missed the entrance to San Francisco Bay, a lapse that mariners would repeat for the next two centuries and more, due to the fog that characterizes the area. The Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno named the land (&quot;Kings&#x27; Point&quot;) when his ship, the &quot;Capitana&quot;, anchored in Drakes Bay on the Day of the Three Kings (Epiphany, or the end of the 12 Days of Christmas) on January 6, 1603.

===Sir Francis Drake===
Although early explorers and Spanish trading galleons journeying between the Philippines and Acapulco passed by Point Reyes, some even anchoring briefly, it is the landing by Sir Francis Drake that dominates discussion of this era of Point Reyes early history. On June 17, 1579, during his circumnavigation, he landed in the vicinity of Point Reyes and proclaimed it &quot;Nova Albion&quot; (&#x27;New Britain&#x27;) . The National Historic Landmark designation has the landing as Drake&#x27;s Cove at Point Reyes National Seashore. Drake&#x27;s chaplain&#x27;s observations about the areas inhabitants suggest the landing occurred near a Coast Miwok settlement. These notes describe the genial welcome Drake and his men received, complete with ceremony and gifts, as well as the landscape and wildlife, and included commentary about fog which frequently obscures the peninsula during the summer months.

===The wreck of &quot;San Agustin&quot;, 1595===

Rumors of Drake&#x27;s discovery of a safe harbor on the California coast intrigued the Spanish. Their trade between the Philippines and Mexico was booming, and they were constantly seeking safe harbors along their route. Many believe that Drake&#x27;s discovery of such a harbor inspired the Spanish to order Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeno, a Portuguese captain trading for Spain, to survey the California coast on his journey to Mexico from the Philippines in 1595. Commanding &quot;San Agustin&quot;, a Manila galleon laden with a luxury cargo of Chinese silks, spices, and Ming porcelain bound for Acapulco, Cermeno endured both the first of hundreds of documented shipwrecks at Point Reyes, as well as one of the most amazing journeys to safety. Among the crew were Filipino mariners.

Struggling with a decrepit, heavily laden ship and a tired crew, Cermeno explored the California coast, eventually anchoring near the Point Reyes inlet now called Drakes Estero. Within a few days, a November storm beached the ship where it listed and was relentlessly pounded by the furious surf. It soon broke apart, killing several men and dumping the precious cargo, some of which was eventually collected and used by the local Coast Miwok inhabitants.

Cermeno salvaged a small, open launch, likened to a large canoe, and loaded it with the 70 surviving crew members to begin the long journey home. After a grueling two-month voyage, remembered as a remarkable feat of seamanship, Cermeno and all crew arrived safely in Acapulco in January 1596. Despite his amazing journey, Cermeno received no celebratory welcome, for he had not only lost his ship and cargo, but had also failed to locate the safe harbor he was ordered to find.

===Portolá&#x27;s inland expedition and the establishment of missions, 1769-1843===
Despite reports of a lovely land populated by friendly tribes, Spain neglected California until the second half of the 18th century. By that time, trade had become an important source of income, and it was becoming clear that the nation controlling California&#x27;s harbors would reap incredible profits. When England, France, and Russia began to covet California&#x27;s coast, the King of Spain knew it was time to fortify it. The Portolá expedition of 67 men and 100 pack mules left San Diego in 1769. Led by Gaspar de Portolá, the governor of Baja California, they began walking to the largest known harbor, Monterey Bay. Portolá expected more of a harbor than what they found at Monterey, and decided they must not have reached it yet. Pushing on north along the coast, they instead discovered San Francisco Bay. Prior to that, from a high point on the coast south of Pacifica, they saw and recognized (from the description of Manila Galleon pilot Cabrera Bueno) Point Reyes and the Farallon Islands. The expedition was blocked from going farther north toward Point Reyes by the Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay, since they had no boats.

Beginning with Portolá&#x27;s expedition, Spain began establishing presidios and Spanish missions in California ((1769–1833)). By 1817, Mission San Rafael was established and padres began journeying to Point Reyes, intent on enticing the Coast Miwok to the mission. Although they were successful in convincing many to settle at the mission, it was soon clear that the Coast Miwoks were not thriving. Serious outbreaks of smallpox and pneumonia killed many. Those who survived sickened from a wide variety of other illnesses, such as colds and measles. Birth rates dropped, and mortality rates increased at an alarming rate. Since the missions depended upon healthy workers for their prosperity, these illnesses foretold their demise.

In 1821, Mexico gained independence from Spain and possession of California in the Mexican War of Independence. Most mission land was subdivided and into large land grants used mainly for cattle ranching. In 1843, Point Reyes itself and Drake&#x27;s Bay being mostly unsuitable for cattle, became part of Rancho Punta de los Reyes Sobrante (&quot;Sobrante&quot; means &quot;leftover&quot;). This was only a few years before cession of California to the United States, which led to decades of confusion and boundary battles.

===Rancho Tomales y Baulines, 1836-1851===
When the Spanish missions in California were dismantled, virtually all of Point Reyes was given to &#x27;Rafael Garcia, a corporal in the Mexican Army, who was awarded two leagues () in March 1836. Named Rancho Tomales y Baulines, it is believed to have included the entire Olema Valley from Tomales Bay to Bolinas Lagoon, although its borders were never clearly defined. Garcia&#x27;s failure to survey and confirm boundaries, as required by Mexican law, set the stage for confusion and lengthy court battles when the rancho was dissolved.

Unlike many rancheros, Garcia obeyed the law by actually living there. He built a wood and thatch home near what is now the National Seashore&#x27;s Bear Valley Headquarters and soon had a home for his family as well as a headquarters for his extensive ranching operation which consisted of approximately 3,000 cattle, 400 horses, and large herds of sheep and hogs. 

When Mexico lost California to the United States, Garcia continued to prosper. Soon after the American takeover, the 1849 California gold rush brought floods of prospectors. Where his wild cattle had been valued only for hides and tallow, he could now sell them to feed hungry gold-seekers, netting as much as $35 each. Unfortunately for Garcia, these gold-rich years ended quickly: in 1851, the United States passed a law requiring rancheros to prove legal ownership of their land grants. While the Garcias continued ranching, their land began to disappear until, after 15 years of litigation, multiple court appearances, and high legal fees, Garcia had sold all but of his grant at bargain prices.

===Confused boundaries 1836-1850s===
Although Garcia believed he owned virtually all of Point Reyes, another Point Reyes land grant was awarded the same year, 1836. It was given to an Irishman, James Berry, who had become a Mexican citizen and colonel in the army. This land grant was also in the Olema Valley, and, to add to the boundary confusion, he soon left the area and hired Garcia to oversee it. A mere two years later, Berry sold nearly of it to a sea captain, Joseph Snook, an act clearly prohibited by Mexican law and grounds for forfeiture of the entire grant. Although Berry understandably wanted to keep the sale secret, Snook wanted legal title. He discovered that the only way he could obtain legal title of the land he had illegally purchased was to formally denounce Berry&#x27;s ownership on the grounds that he had never occupied it. He was successful and gained legal title to the land he had illegally purchased, stocked it with 56 head of cattle, and, like Berry, hired Garcia to oversee it. Three months after he won legal title, he illegally sold it.

And so began a confusing series of sales and transfers that no one seemed to be able to untangle. Finally, in 1844, the rancheros themselves asked the Mexican government to investigate titles and clarify ownership. Little was clarified, and it was not until the United States took possession of California and required rancheros to conduct surveys and make court appearances to retain their land that the confusing pattern of sales and trades were untangled. Most rancheros were eventually able to prove ownership. Unfortunately, by this time, they had run out of cash and were forced to sell to pay the survey and daunting legal fees. Entrepreneurial Americans were delighted to capitalize on the opportunity. With cash in hand, they purchased these huge Mexican land grants, often paying less than $2 per acre, thus beginning Point Reyes&#x27;s next chapter as a dairying empire.

===The Shafter Family, 1854-1937 ===
Settlement patterns at Point Reyes were forever changed when the Shafters acquired it in 1857. Brothers Oscar Lovell Shafter and James McMillan Shafter established large-scale successful dairy operations. 
13 of the 31 dairies they established still operate today.

Oscar was the first to arrive. A Vermont lawyer intent upon making his fortune and returning home as soon as possible, he left his family to journey to booming San Francisco. His separation from them became intolerable when his two youngest children died while he was away. Still not willing to give up the promise of wealth, he convinced his wife to come, bringing their surviving daughter. They thrived, and Oscar fathered four more California-born daughters. Oscar soon convinced his younger brother, James, also a lawyer, to join him. They became known as San Francisco&#x27;s foremost authorities on title litigation. Using their title expertise, they began acquiring Point Reyes land. When Oscar&#x27;s oldest daughter married Charles Webb Howard, also a lawyer, the trio partnered to transform windswept Point Reyes into prosperous dairies.

Determined to supply booming San Francisco with its butter, by 1857, the partners began fencing significant expanses of land (eventually resulting in 40 miles of fencing), building homes and barns, and stocking the dairies with the pure-bred bulls and rams, some costing over $1,400. By 1868, they had 3,500 cows on 17 dairies and were producing over 700,000 pounds of butter a year. All their dairies were operated by renters. When the most industrious of these renters tried to buy the dairy they worked, they failed. Many eventually left, establishing some of California&#x27;s other major dairies.

Despite their boundless optimism about the promise of Point Reyes, they were plagued by financial worries. After they passed, their children tried to hold on to the dairies, trying unsuccessfully to stop their decline despite aging ranches, sickening herds, and often unhappy tenants. Finally, in 1937, an era ended when the last of the Shafter Empire was sold, ushering in a new parade of owners.

===The towns of Point Reyes===
Four towns can be found on Point Reyes: Bolinas, Olema, Inverness, and Point Reyes Station. During Spanish and Mexican War, Bolinas&#x27; remote lagoon was used by American, British, and Russian smugglers intent on avoiding tariffs and regulations. Later, when the Gold Rush of 1849 generated a huge market for lumber, Bolinas became the port for nearby timber operations and, briefly, quarrying limestone. By the late 1960s, Bolinas had become home to a large community of hippies, many of whom had left San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury for a less populated paradise. In 1971, they succeeded in scrapping a master plan calling for a population of 28,000 by imposing a moratorium on new homes and defeating efforts to widen its access highway. Instead, a plan was approved that made agriculture, fishing, and small business the town&#x27;s economic base. Bolinas soon gained renown for its unusual structures and recreational drug use. 
As soon as the Shafter dairies began to thrive, it became evident that Point Reyes needed a centrally located town for supplies, services, and entertainment. In 1857, a hotel and saloon were built and the young town was named &quot;Olema&quot;, meaning &quot;coyote&quot; in the Coast Miwok dialect. Within three years, it had emerged as the region&#x27;s commercial center with a post office, grocery store, saloon, butcher, livery stable, and two hotels. By 1867, a wagon road from San Rafael was built and a stage coach arrived twice a week. Druids Hall was completed in 1885. While this Olema chapter of the United Ancient Order of Druids adhered to principles of mutual support, intellectual growth, and social consciousness, it also served as a temperance society.

The Shafters lobbied hard for a railroad to serve Point Reyes. When it was finally built, it bypassed Olema, terminating, instead, two miles away. When the first train arrived early in 1875, Point Reyes Station was a cow pasture. By 1880, it had a hotel, saloon, blacksmith shop, livery stable, butcher shop, and school. Its post office was completed in 1882, and its first store opened in 1883. When the railroad era ended, growth was slow. It was not until after World War II that a medical center and a shopping center, including a drugstore, dentist, coffee shop, and library, had been completed. The train station became the local post office, while the former engine house was converted into a community center. In the 1970s, hippies established cottage industries in abandoned houses and shops. At the same time, the Coast Guard bought 30 acres of land formerly used as cattle pens, and built military housing. Continuing as the region&#x27;s supply and service center, it is a popular destination with shops, restaurants, and an annual music festival.

===20th century===

As developers and loggers submitted plans, a 1956 National Park Service (NPS) study of possible seashore parks recommended acquisition of the peninsula. By 1958, a report was published recommending immediate NPS acquisition of 35,000 acres. Controversy raged, with environmentalists applauding the proposal and the ranchers opposing it. A compromise was crafted which allowed the ranchers to lease their land and continue dairying while coexisting with tourists and park activities. On September 13, 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed the bill authorizing the acquisition of 53,000 acres and allocating $13 million. Eventually 18,000 acres purchased by the NPS were leased back to ranchers.

In cooperation with the NPS, volunteers have restored and maintain a historic coastal radiotelegraph marine station, KSM (ex-KPH), at Point Reyes. It remains one of the few commercial Morse code stations operating in the world, and is the only one in the U.S.

During the Cold War, submarines repaired at Mare Island Naval Shipyard were tested in the shallow waters off Point Reyes following shipyard repairs. Navy safety personnel used a small monitoring and communications hut on the peninsula for monitoring submarines during these sea trials.

In April and May 1979, part of John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Fog&quot; was shot at the Point Reyes Lighthouse and the small town of Inverness.

As of 2015, Drakes Bay Oyster Company (DBOC) has ceased operations, and most infrastructure has been removed from the site. The closure comes as a result of their lease ending.

==Ecology==

Beginning in the 18th century, northern elephant seals (&quot;Mirounga angustirostris&quot;) were hunted extensively almost to extinction by the end of the 19th century. They were prized for oil that could be made from their blubber, and the population may have fallen as low as 20. In 1874 American whaleman Charles Melville Scammon recorded in &quot;Marine Mammals of the Northwestern Coast of America&quot;, that &quot;the elephant seal...known to the Old Californians as &quot;Elefante marino&quot; had a geographical distribution from Cape Lazaro (about 1/4 of the way up the Baja peninsula) in the south to Point Reyes in the north&quot;. They were thought to be extinct in 1884 until a remnant population of eight individuals was discovered on Guadalupe Island in 1892 by a Smithsonian expedition, who promptly killed seven of the eight for their collections. The elephant seals managed to survive, and were finally protected by the Mexican government in 1922. Subsequently, the U.S. protection was strengthened after passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972, and numbers have now recovered to over 100,000. The first breeding pair was discovered on a sheltered beach below Point Reyes&#x27; Chimney Rock in 1981 and has multiplied at a remarkable 16% per year to the present population of 1,500 to 2,000 individuals each winter.

California&#x27;s native tule elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis nannodes&quot;) were hunted until only a handful of animals remained in California&#x27;s southern Central Valley. Joseph Warren Revere, the grandson of Revolutionary War patriot Paul Revere, wrote in his book &quot;Naval Duty in California&quot; that he counted 400 elk in a single herd on Pt. Reyes in the 1840&#x27;s. Stephen J. Richardson, son of Marin County pioneer Captain William A. Richardson, wrote &quot;I think the largest herd in the world roamed over the deep grasslands of Point Reyes...I fully believe there were a thousand elk in one herd.&quot; Although they had been completely extirpated from Point Reyes, in 1978, ten elk were reintroduced to Point Reyes from the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge near Los Banos. By 2009, the population climbed to over 440 elk at Tomales Point&#x27;s 2,600 acres of coastal scrub and grasslands. In 1999, 100 elk from Tomales Point were moved to the Limantour wilderness area of the Seashore and above Drakes Beach to Ranch A, as that ranch&#x27;s long-term lease expired and was not renewed. The drought in 2012–2015 was also a threat to the elk confined north of the fence on Tomales Point, with nearly half the elk there dying from lack of water. In 2012 there were 540 elk, then only 357 in 2013, and by 2014 only 286. In August and September 2020, drought and wildfires again threaten the Tomales Point elk, leading some conservationists to illegally bring water to the elk north of the fence. Half of the ten Point Reyes dairy cattle herds were infected with paratuberculosis (aka Johne&#x27;s Disease) along with exotic deer in a 1977 study. Tule elk became infected within two years of their reintroduction to the peninsula with this disease, which was brought to North America with Eurasian cattle. Another nonnative, bacterial disease, brucellosis, can induce abortions in pregnant cattle, elk, and bison, and was also brought to North America by importation of Eurasian cattle. Pt. Reyes cattle have also infected the tule elk population.

Non-native axis deer and fallow deer (originally from India and Asia Minor, respectively) used to inhabit Point Reyes, where they competed with native black-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus columbianus&quot;). A doctor bought the axis and fallow deer from the San Francisco Zoo in 1948 for his 5,000-acre hunting club, which later became part of the national seashore. In 2006, the park embarked on a plan to eradicate the non-native deer via contraception and culling, which succeeded despite controversy, over a twenty year program.

Vegetation native to Point Reyes includes bishop pine, Douglas-fir, coyote brush, monkeyflower, poison oak, California blackberry, salal and coast redwood, among others. Nearly 490 different species of birds have been observed in the park and on adjacent waters. 

Tule elk within this region primarily consume native grasses and forbs such as Nassella pulchra. This is an essential aspect that helps maintain the biodiversity of the grassland ecosystem. The interaction between these plants and the elk helps prevent the encroachment of invasive shrubs and non-native species. An example of a species that can be prevented through the grazing of the elk is Holcus lanatus. 

By grazing the land, the elk promote native species to flourish. This action allows for the open grassland to be sustained and supports the overall ecosystem. The interaction is a cruel aspect that highlights the important of preserving the ecological balance at Point Reyes. 

==Geology==

The entire Point Reyes Peninsula is a piece of the Salinian Block transported northward by the San Andreas Fault. Its core is granite, unlike the terrain east of Tomales Bay. The granite rocks that form the peninsula were once continuous with the Tehachapi Mountains, which is located south of here. In the 1906 earthquake, Point Reyes moved north .

Point Reyes is bounded to the east by the San Andreas Fault, which runs directly under Tomales Bay, and is structurally dominated by the Point Reyes Syncline. The Point Reyes Peninsula is on the Pacific Plate, while the rest of Marin County land is on the North American Plate. The peninsula is a member of the Salinian Block, a segment of the southernmost Sierra Nevada range transported north from Southern California by movement along the San Andreas fault. Simply speaking, the peninsula consists of three major members: the Salinian Cretaceous crystalline basement, the overlying Pliocene sedimentary rocks, and the late Pleistocene marine terrace deposits of the southern peninsula.

==Climate==
The U.S. Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service) maintained a cooperative weather station in the Point Reyes lighthouse from 1914 to 1943, though temperatures were only tracked through 1926. Based on those records, average January temperatures ranged from and average September temperatures ranged from . The highest temperature recorded was on October 3, 1917, and the lowest temperature recorded was on January 19, 1922. Annual precipitation averaged . The wettest year on record was 1941 with and the driest year was 1923 was . The most precipitation in one month was in December 1916. The maximum 24-hour precipitation was on December 15, 1929. Automated weather observations are now taken at the lighthouse. Weather observations are also taken in nearby Point Reyes Station and published in local newspapers, including the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;.

===Fog===
It can get very foggy and windy during certain parts of the year at the lighthouse, and to be effective, the lighthouse had to be situated below the characteristic high fog. When foggy, visibility is so slim that one cannot even view the lighthouse from the top of the approximately 300 steps necessary to walk down to reach it.

The lighthouse serves a great purpose in such a foggy area, as there is no beach to wash up on; it is on a rocky cliff. Day or night, the light may be the only thing visible to ships.

==Recreation==
The peninsula is a popular recreational destination for the nearby San Francisco Bay Area, especially for hiking on its many trails and sea kayaking the shores of Tomales Bay and the coast. There are close to of trails, including the popular Bear Valley Trail, which starts from the Visitor Center. Point Reyes National Seashore offers some of the finest birdwatching in the United States. It is also one of the best places to watch northern elephant seals in the winter months. More than of habitat harbor an incredible variety of bird life. There are also popular oyster farms on and near the peninsula.

<text>HMS &quot;Charybdis&quot; (F75) was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was built by the Harland &amp; Wolff company of Belfast, and was the last ship to be built there for British naval forces until of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, was launched in 1990. &quot;Charybdis&quot; was launched on 28 February 1968 and commissioned on 2 June 1969. Her nickname was &quot;Cherry B&quot;.

==Operational Service==
In 1969, &quot;Charybdis&quot; became guard ship of Gibraltar. The following year, &quot;Charybdis&quot; deployed to the Far East and Pacific at a time when there was a large RN presence in those regions. During her time there, &quot;Charybdis&quot; took part in a number of exercises with Commonwealth countries, including Exercise Longex with New Zealand. &quot;Charybdis&quot; visited many countries on &#x27;fly the flag&#x27; duties, which remains a prominent role for a Royal Navy warship.

In 1973 &quot;Charybdis&quot; spent time in the Second Cod War when Iceland wanted to extend their control of the fishing waters from . At that time there were normally three frigates and three ocean-going tugs deployed to protect the groups of British fishing trawlers.

In 1976, &quot;Charybdis&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean. The following year, &quot;Charybdis&quot; joined the Fishery Protection Squadron, just a year after the Third Cod War ended. &quot;Charybdis&quot; took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. At this time she was part of the 6th Frigate Squadron. In early 1979, &quot;Charybdis&quot; underwent yet another Mediterranean patrol.

From 1979 to 1982, &quot;Charybdis&quot; underwent modernisation that included the fitting of Exocet and Sea Wolf missiles, and the removal of her twin 4.5 in guns. The refit was cut short and &quot;Charybdis&quot; was rushed back into service due to the Argentinean invasion of the Falkland Islands. In late 1982, in the aftermath of the Falklands War, &quot;Charybdis&quot; deployed on a Falkland Islands patrol, which at the time was still a tense region. Through the rest of the 1980s, &quot;Charybdis&quot; undertook duties in the West Indies, Mediterranean and in the Persian Gulf. In 1984 she was again deploying to the Falkland Islands as part of a task group, but was detached from the group whilst in Gibraltar and diverted to the Gulf region where she joined HM Ships &quot;Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Falmouth&quot; and RFA &quot;Orangeleaf&quot;. On the arrival of &quot;Charybdis&quot;, &quot;Falmouth&quot; was detached to the Far East. A group call into Karachi by &quot;Charybdis&quot;, &quot;Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Orangeleaf&quot; for scheduled maintenance was the last port visit by the group as, due to rising tensions, all port visits were cancelled. In 1985 she deployed yet again to the Gulf as part of the Armilla Patrol protecting ships transiting the Straits of Hormuz, and also in 1988. In 1990, &quot;Charybdis&quot; was on Persian Gulf patrol, with several flying the flag visits in the Far East. She was due to visit America and the Falklands in 1991, but was retasked to return to the eastern Mediterranean to act as Sea Wolf protection for the flagship during the first Gulf War.

==Fate==
In September 1991, &quot;Charybdis&quot; was decommissioned. She was sunk during a Joint Maritime Course sinking exercise on 11 June 1993 off of the Benbecula Rocket Range in the Western Isles of Scotland.

<text>Since its inception in 1954, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; has annually presented the Sportsman of the Year award to &quot;the athlete or team whose performance that year most embodies the spirit of sportsmanship and achievement.&quot; Both Americans and non-Americans are eligible, though in the past the vast majority of winners have been from the United States. Both men and women have won the award, originally called &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; and renamed &quot;Sportswoman of the Year&quot; or &quot;Sportswomen of the Year&quot; when applicable.

Tiger Woods, Tom Brady and LeBron James are the only individuals who have received the award more than once. Woods received his first award in 1996 as an amateur golfer, and in 2000 as a professional golfer. Brady received his first award in 2005, and his second in 2021. James received his first award in 2012, his second in 2016, and a third in 2020. Curt Schilling and Stephen Curry have won the award both individually and as part of a team.

The trophy is a ceramic replica of an ancient Greek amphora (c. 510 BC) which depicts nude male Hellenistic athletes engaged in a variety of athletic activities—running, discus, and javelin. It measures 8&quot; in diameter and stands 18.5&quot; high (20.32 x 47 cm). The original amphora was acquired by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine in 1954 and was donated to the &quot;Sports&quot; collection of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History in 1979. Winners of the award are now presented with a copy of the amphora made in silver by Tiffany &amp; Co.

== Winners ==

The award&#x27;s trophy, a ceramic urn depicting great athletes, has been given to the following recipients:

<text>Marilyn Lorraine &quot;Lynn&quot; Abbey (born September 18, 1948) is an American fantasy author.

==Background==
Lynn Abbey was born in Peekskill, New York. She attended the University of Rochester, where she began as an astrophysics major. She earned a A.B. (1969) and an M.A. (1971) in European history, but shifted to computer programming as a profession &quot;when my advisor pointed out that, given the natural rise and fall of demographic curves, tenured university faculty positions were going to be as scarce as hen&#x27;s teeth for the next twenty-five years and my education was turning into an expensive hobby. (He was right, too.)&quot; She had married Ralph Dressler July 14, 1969; they were divorced October 31, 1972. During this period she also became a member of science fiction fandom.

==Move to Michigan; accident and aftermath==
In 1976, after a stint as a programmer for insurance companies, and work on the state task force involved in documenting the New York City bankruptcy crisis, she moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan. In January 1977, she was injured in an automobile accident while going to pick up Gordon R. Dickson, who was to be a Guest of Honor at that year&#x27;s ConFusion. The guilt-ridden Dickson volunteered to assist her by reading and critiquing her work (she&#x27;d been writing since childhood). The manuscript he helped her with became &quot;Daughter of the Bright Moon&quot;.

==Publication and marriage==
Abbey began publishing in 1979 with &quot;Daughter of the Bright Moon&quot; and the short story &quot;The Face of Chaos,&quot; in &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot;, the first part of the &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; shared world anthology.

On August 28, 1982, she married Robert Asprin, editor of the Thieves&#x27; World books, and became his co-editor. She also contributed to other shared world series during the 1980s, including &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot; and &quot;Merovingen Nights&quot;.

She began writing for TSR, Inc. around 1994 while continuing to write novels and edit anthologies. Her works for TSR include stories set in the Forgotten Realms and the Dark Sun settings. Lynn Abbey wrote for TSR&#x27;s Dark Sun series starting with &quot;The Brazen Gambit&quot;. Further novels in the series include &quot;The Rise and Fall of a Dragon King&quot;, a novel exploring the topic of genocide, a central theme in the ancient history of Athas, the world on which the Dark Sun setting takes place. Along with &quot;Cinnabar Shadows&quot;, all three of Abbey&#x27;s books written for the Athasian setting take place in and around the City-state of Urik.

==Divorce and moves==
Abbey and Asprin divorced in 1993 and Abbey moved to Oklahoma City. She continued to write novels during this period, including original works as well as tie-ins to role playing games for TSR. In 2002, she returned to Thieves&#x27; World with the novel &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and also began editing new anthologies, beginning with &quot;Turning Points&quot;. In 2006, she was a writer on Green Ronin&#x27;s version of &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot;. She has lived in Leesburg, Florida since 1997.

<text>Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, commonly known as Kotte (), is the legislative capital of Sri Lanka. Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is located adjacent to the urban area of Sri Lanka&#x27;s de facto economic, executive, and judicial capital, Colombo.

The Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council area is bounded in:

* the North by Kolonnawa Urban Council area, 
* the North-East by the Kotikawatta–Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha area, 
* the East by the Kaduwela Municipal Council area, 
* the South-East by the Maharagama Urban Council area, 
* the South-West by the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council and 
* the West by the Colombo Municipal Council area, which is the commercial capital of Sri Lanka.

== History ==

The village of Darugama lay at the confluence of two streams, the Diyawanna Oya and the Kolonnawa Oya. As Darugama was a naturally secure place, it was not easy for enemies to enter it. Here, in the 13th century, a local chieftain, Nissanka Alagakkonara, built a &quot;Kotte&quot;, or fortress.

Alagakkonara is mentioned by Ibn Batuta as ruling in Kurunegala, but other sources indicate that he was the Bandara (Guardian) of Raigama Korale (county) in the modern Kalutara District. Arya Chakravarthy&#x27;s army was held by Alagakkonara in front of Kotte, while he defeated the enemy&#x27;s invasion fleet at Panadura to the south-west.

Kotte was a &quot;jala durgha&quot; (water fortress), in the shape of a triangle, with the Diyawanna Oya and Kolonnawa Oya marshes forming two long sides; along the shorter third (land) side a large moat (the &#x27;inner moat&#x27;) was dug. The fortress was nearly in area, fortified with ramparts of &quot;kabook&quot; or laterite rock, high and in breadth.

In 1391, following the conquest of the Kingdom of Jaffna by Prince Sapumal (Sembahap Perumal), Kotte was given the epithet &#x27;Sri Jayawardenepura&#x27; (&#x27;resplendent city of growing victory&#x27;). It became the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Kotte, which it remained until the end of the 16th century.

From the ramparts to the magnificent three storied buildings that housed the kings palace, laterite and clay were the main raw material used in its construction. One of the places from which the laterite blocks were mined can be seen even today inside the premises of Ananda Sasthralaya (a local school).

The main features of the capital city were:

* the king&#x27;s palace, with walls of quartz that sparkle in the moonlight (&quot;candrakanta pasana&quot;) and a golden spire, with beautiful flower gardens and springs of water,
* the three-storeyed Dalada Maligawa with Buddha&#x27;s sacred tooth relic in it (Temple of the tooth),
* the five-storeyed &quot;Arama&quot; where sixty Buddhist Bhikkus resided, with a Sangha Raja(a high priest)as the chief incumbent,
* the king&#x27;s treasure house,
* the &#x27;Kotavehara&#x27; at Baddagana, the only Buddhist temple of the city outside the moat and rampart,
* the royal cemetery at Beddagana (Veherakanda memorial),
* and the &#x27;Angampitiya&#x27;, the military parade and training ground just inside the inner moat.
The Portuguese arrived on the island in 1505 and were initially welcomed by the king, but they had militaristic and monopolistic intentions and gained control of the city by 1565. Failing to withstand repeated assaults by the forces of the neighbouring kingdom of Sitawaka, the city was abandoned by the Portuguese, who made Colombo their new capital.

Like similar cities of that era, Sri Jayawardenepura was built with security in mind. A rampart and moat protected the entire city. Traces of this moat and rampart are still visible today at certain places. Along parts of the rampart, encroachers have now built houses, garages and even toilets.

The urbanisation of Kotte restarted in the 19th century. The archaeological remains were torn up and used as building materials (a process that continues)—some of it even ending up in the Victoria Bridge, across the Kelani River.

== Legislature ==
The New Parliament was inaugurated on 29 April 1982. The buildings were built on reclaimed land, after a massive lake was formed by dredging the marshlands around the Diyawanna Oya. The new parliamentary buildings were built on Duwa, a 50,000 square metre (12 acre) island in the centre of the lake. The island (off Baddegana Road, Pita Kotte) had been used as a recreation and brawling spot for Portuguese soldiers in the last days of Kotte era, alcohol being banned from the Royal City. It had belonged to E. W. Perera and had housed a chicken farm prior to being vested in the state. On 29 April 1982, the new parliamentary complex was declared open by the former president J. R. Jayewardene.

The process of relocating government institutions from the former capital of Colombo is still in progress.

== Municipal structure ==
The Kotte Urban Development Council was created in the 1930s, with a modern building at Rajagiriya. It was succeeded by the Kotte Urban Council, which had a large section of its area removed and tagged onto the Colombo Municipal Council ward of Borella while the Battaramulla urban council was dissolved and a small section of Battaramulla tagged onto the Kotte Urban Council. The Kotte Urban Council became the Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council in 1997, with Chandra Silva as the first Mayor.

There are 20 Members of the Municipal Council (MMCs), elected on proportional representation. There are 18 wards, but these are now merely polling divisions, without individual representation.

=== Zones ===

* Ethul Kotte
* Nawala
* Nugegoda
* Rajagiriya

== Demographics ==
Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious urban centre. According to the census of 2012, the demographics by ethnicity and religion is as follows:

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===
The only main railway station is at Nugegoda, on the Kelani Valley Line. Also at Nugegoda is the main bus terminus. There are subsidiary bus stands at Pita Kotte. This urban area is well served by buses and there is a CTB bus depot at Udahamulla.

In 2005, a Passenger boat service was being finalised and would commence adjacent to Parliament Junction at Bataramulla and end at the Wellawatte canal near Marine drive. Each journey would take around 30 minutes. It would have stations at the Kotte Marsh, Nawala, Open University, Apollo Hospital, Duplication road, Wellawatte and at St Peter&#x27;s College, Colombo. The Sri Lanka Navy is conducting a pilot project between the Open University and Wellawatte.

=== Health ===
The main hospital of area situated at Madivela known as Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital is a gift from the Japanese government. There is a dedicated Eye &amp; ENT hospital at Rajagiriya, and another maternity hospital under construction in Nawala. A small private health centre, the Blue Cross Hospital at Rajagiriya, provides basic facilities for medical diagnostics, and there is a small nursing home in Park Lane, Welikada, much patronised by Maldivians.

=== Education ===
There are a number of state and private schools in Kotte. They are either &quot;national schools&quot; (run by the central government; Main School President&#x27;s College, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte), &quot;government schools&quot; (run by the Provincial Councils), semi-government/private schools, or International schools (run by trusts and individuals; Gateway College Colombo is an example of the latter class of school).

The oldest English school on the island is Sri Jayawardenepura Maha Vidyalaya, formerly known as Christian College, located in Pita Kotte. The Ananda Sastralaya at Pita Kotte is the oldest Buddhist school in the city, and Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda is the third-largest Buddhist girls school in South Asia, with over 5000 students.

The Education Ministry as well as the Department of Examinations is based in Kotte.

A considerable number of the students living within the zone study at government owned colleges and International schools in Colombo.

Located at Nawala is the Open University, Sri Lanka, and at Nugegoda is the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Public Libraries are conveniently located, and can be found at Nugegoda and Rajagiriya.

== Climate ==
Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte features a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: Af) more subject to the Intertropical Convergence Zone than the trade winds. Since there are a few cyclones, the climate is not purely equatorial but subequatorial, with little variation in temperatures throughout the course of the year. The city does feature wetter and drier months, with February on average being its driest month, seeing on average of precipitation. However, since none of the average monthly precipitation falls below , Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte falls under the tropical rainforest climate category.

== Sports and recreation ==

Cricket is the most popular sport in this urban area as well as the country and is usually played in the grounds around the city.

Association football was at one time the most popular sport in the Colombo area, although it was eclipsed by cricket after 1980. Four separate football clubs (Lido, Welikada Progress, Welikada Red Star and Welikada United) once used the EW Perera Park grounds at Welikada, Rajagiriya where a pavilion was constructed in the 1970s. However, when the grounds were destroyed by the JR Jayawardene regime in the late 1970s, the football clubs disappeared. Football continued to be played at the grounds at Obeysekerapura in Rajagiriya.

In the 1990s, the Kotte Municipal Council constructed the Chandra Silva Stadium, to replace the EW Perera Grounds. Part of the grounds was sold and later used to construct the HSBC building. In 2007 the Municipality, with aid from the Ministry of Urban Development, completed the first stage of the new Chandra Silva Stadium on the site of a rubbish dump behind the HSBC building.

Recently, football has once more grown in popularity, and the sport now has a considerable following. The football association&#x27;s new training facility at Kotte is aimed at harnessing and developing the available talent and organizing the individual players into a cohesive team. It includes a football playground with a sprinkler system, gym and a host of other facilities.

Other sports are mostly played in the numerous clubs and gyms, and include tennis, squash, billiards, horse riding, indoor cricket, badminton and table tennis. Horse riding can be pursued at the Premadasa Riding School in Nugegoda.

<doc id="572202" wikidata="Q3057449" url="?curid=572202" title="Seán Heuston">
<text>Seán Heuston ( ; ; born John Joseph Heuston; 21 February 1891 – 8 May 1916) was an Irish republican rebel and member of Fianna Éireann who took part in the Easter Rising of 1916. With about 20 Volunteers, he held the Mendicity Institution on the River Liffey for over two days, though it was originally only intended to be held for 3–4 hours. He was executed by firing squad on 8 May in Kilmainham Gaol. His court-martial record at Kew spells his name as Hewston J.J..

==Early life==
Heuston was born at Gloucester Street in Dublin on 21 February 1891, the son of clerk John Heuston and Maria McDonald. Educated by the Christian Brothers, he later worked as a railway clerk in Limerick and while there took an active part in Fianna Éireann, of which he was an officer. Seán Heuston arranged for members who could not afford to buy their uniforms to do so by paying small weekly sums. Under his guidance the Fianna in Limerick had a course which encompassed not only drilling, including signalling, scout training and weapons training, but also lectures on Irish history and Irish classes.

==Irish Volunteers and Fianna Eireann==
In 1913 Heuston was transferred to Dublin Fianna, and was appointed to the Emmet Sluagh. He went on to join the ranks of the Irish Volunteers and played a prominent part in the Easter Rising. He was Director of Training for Fianna Eireann as well as being Vice-commandant of the Dublin Battalion and Commander of the 5th company from August 1915 to Easter 1916.

==Easter Rising==
Heuston was the Officer Commanding the Irish Volunteers assigned to hold the Mendicity Institution (now called Heustons Fort) on the south side of Dublin city which guarded against the British approach to the strategically important Four Courts buildings. Acting under orders from James Connolly, Heuston was to hold this position for three or four hours, to delay the advance of British troops. This delay was necessary to give the headquarters staff time to prepare their defences. Having successfully held the position for the specified period, he was to go on to hold it for over two days, with twenty-six Volunteers. With his position becoming untenable against considerable numbers, and the building almost completely surrounded, he sent a dispatch to Connolly informing him of their position. The dispatch was carried by two Volunteers, P. J. Stephenson and Seán McLaughlin, who had to avoid both sniper fire and British troops across the city. It was soon after sending this dispatch that Heuston decided to surrender.

==The Surrender==

Séamus Brennan, a member of the Mendicity Institution Garrison under Heuston, gave the following account of the decision to surrender: 

==Prisoners==
According to the statement given by Séamus Brennan to Piaras F. Mac Lochlainn, author of &quot;Last Words&quot;, the British troops were &quot;infuriated when they saw the pygmy force that had given them such a stiff battle and caused them so many casualties&quot;.Séamus Brennan never saw Seán Heuston again after being transferred to Arbour Hill Detention Barracks.

==Court martial==
Heuston had been transferred to Richmond Barracks, and on 4 May 1916, he was tried by court-martial. On the Sunday, 7 May 1916, the verdict of the court martial was communicated to him that he had been sentenced to death and was to be shot at dawn the following morning.

==Execution==

Prior to his execution he was attended by Father Albert, O.F.M. Cap in his final hours. Father Albert wrote an account of those hours up to and including the execution: Father Albert concluded:

<doc id="572221" wikidata="Q935297" url="?curid=572221" title="St Mary Mead">
<text>St Mary Mead is a fictional village created by popular crime fiction author Dame Agatha Christie.

The quaint, sleepy village was home to the renowned detective spinster Miss Marple. However, Christie first described a village of that name prior to Marple&#x27;s introduction, in the 1928 Hercule Poirot novel &quot;The Mystery of the Blue Train&quot;. In that novel, St Mary Mead is home to the book&#x27;s protagonist Katherine Grey. It is not the same village as Miss Marple&#x27;s home, being in a different county. The village was first mentioned in a Miss Marple book in 1930, when it was the setting for the first Marple novel, &quot;The Murder at the Vicarage&quot;.

==Location==
Miss Marple&#x27;s St Mary Mead is described in &quot;The Murder at the Vicarage&quot; as being in the fictional county of Downshire, but in the later novel &quot;The Body in the Library&quot; Downshire has become Radfordshire. In the BBC Miss Marple TV adaptation of &quot;Nemesis&quot;, a letter from Mr Rafiel&#x27;s solicitors indicate that St Mary Mead is located in the (also fictional) county of Middleshire. The St Mary Mead of Katherine Grey is in Kent.

Miss Marple lives in Danemead Cottage, the last cottage in Old Pasture Lane. Her telephone number is &quot;three five&quot; on a manual exchange.

Once it has been fully established as Miss Marple&#x27;s home village, St Mary Mead is supposed to be in South East England, from London and 25 miles from Alton. It is just outside the town of Much Benham and is close to Market Basing (which appears as a name of a town in many of Agatha Christie&#x27;s novels and short stories), from the fashionable seaside resort of Danemouth, and also from the coastal town of Loomouth. Using the distances from Alton and London gives a narrow possible location of a Vesica Piscis bounded by Winkfield, Bagshot, Peaslake, East Horsley, Byfleet and Windsor Great Park. This is inconsistent though with the references to the proximity of the coast as the coast is at least 25 miles from this area. Other towns said to be close by include Brackhampton, Medenham Wells, and Milchester. The neighbourhood of St Mary Mead is served by trains arriving at Paddington railway station, indicating a location west or south-west of London. It has been suggested that Market Basing is Basingstoke and Danemouth is Bournemouth. In the BBC Miss Marple television adaptations the Hampshire village of Nether Wallop was used as the setting for St Mary Mead. Brackhampton could be Bracknell, although this is 26 miles north of Basingstoke.

==Description==
Before the Second World War, the village was not particularly large. The only road of significance passing through it was the High Street. Here were the well-established establishments of Mr Petherick, the solicitor; Mrs Jamieson, the hairdresser; Mr Thomas&#x27;s basket-weavers; the &#x27;Blue Boar&#x27; pub; Mr Footit the butcher, Mr Jim Armstrong&#x27;s dairy, Mr Berks the baker, and Mr Baker&#x27;s grocery shop. The lightly-trafficked railway station, featured in the book &quot;Murder at the Vicarage&quot;, is also to be found at the very end of the High Street; although the station may have closed by the period of the novel &quot;4.50 from Paddington&quot;, as Mrs McGillicuddy has a taxi arranged for the from Milchester station to Miss Marple&#x27;s house.


Then, slightly further up Lansham Road, was the Victorian structure of Gossington Hall. Until the 1950s this was lived in by a retired soldier, Colonel Arthur Bantry, and his wife Mrs Dolly Bantry, Miss Marple&#x27;s best friends in the village. However, after Colonel Bantry died, Mrs Bantry sold the estate, but continued to live in the grounds, in the East Lodge. After one or two changes of ownership, the Hall was later bought by the film star Marina Gregg. One mile down Lansham Road was a very modern cottage called Chatsworth, also known as the &quot;Period Piece&quot; and &quot;Mr Booker&#x27;s new house&quot;. It was bought in the early 1930s by Basil Blake, a member of the art department at Lemville film studios. It was also inhabited by Basil&#x27;s wife, Dinah Lee, an actress.

At the other end of Lansham Road, a small lane called Old Pasture Lane broke away from the main street. Nestled in this lane were three Queen Anne or Georgian houses, which belonged to three spinsters. The first house belonged to the long-nosed, gushing and excitable Miss Caroline Wetherby. The second house was that of Miss Amanda Hartnell, a proud, decent woman with a deep voice. The last cottage was called Danemead Cottage and belonged to Miss Jane Marple, the famous spinster who solved countless cases between 1930 and 1976. The Post Office, and the dressmaker&#x27;s shop belonging to Mrs Politt, were located in front of the lane.

At the centre of the village was the Vicarage, a very grand Victorian structure at the end of Old Pasture Lane. This was home to the Vicar, Leonard Clement, his young wife, Griselda, with their nephew, Dennis, and later with their two sons, Leonard and David.

Near the gardens of the Vicarage was a back lane which led to a small cottage called Little Gates. Until 1930, it was inhabited by an Anglo-Indian colonel who moved away and briefly rented it out to Mrs Lestrange.

Beyond the Vicarage were two more houses. The first was the residence of the village GP, Doctor Gerard Haydock. He continued to live on in the village beyond 1960. The other cottage was much larger than Dr Haydock&#x27;s and belonged to Mrs Martha Price-Ridley, a rich and dictatorial widow, and the most vicious gossip of all the old ladies in the village. There was also a large estate, Old Hall, belonging to the despised local magistrate, Colonel Lucius Protheroe. He was murdered in 1930 in Mr Clement&#x27;s study in the Vicarage. After his death, the house was turned into a block of flats, to the great disapproval of the villagers. The flats housed Mrs Carmichael, a rich and eccentric old lady who was bullied by her maid, the Larkins, two sisters by the name of Skinner, one of whom was a supposed hypochondriac, and a young married couple. A robbery was later committed by the Skinner sisters.

Finally, just beyond the home of Mrs Price-Ridley was a small stream, leading to the fields of Farmer Giles. However, the Second World War took its toll on the village, and soon after the war Farmer Giles&#x27;s fields were bought and a new housing estate was built. This was referred to as &#x27;The Development&#x27; by the villagers who survived the war. A large hospital was also built nearby, staffed by many doctors and nurses. As well as this, there were some very large hotels and three film studios: Lenville, Elstree and Hellingforth.

<doc id="572232" wikidata="Q3492193" url="?curid=572232" title="Danzig 4">
<text>Danzig 4, also titled Danzig 4P, is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Danzig. Released in 1994, it was the band&#x27;s final album on American Recordings, and the last to feature the original lineup of John Christ (guitar), Eerie Von (bass), and Chuck Biscuits (drums). &quot;Danzig 4&quot; followed 1993&#x27;s highly successful &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot; EP and singer Glenn Danzig&#x27;s 1992 instrumental solo effort, &quot;Black Aria&quot;.

==Album title==
In various 1994-95 interviews, Danzig explained that he did not wish to give the album a title, as he felt that a logo or printing would ruin the artwork, which he wished to stand on its own. After pressure from representatives from American Recordings, who did not want to release an unlabeled album for fear that sales would plummet, Danzig relented and allowed a sticker reading &quot;Danzig 4&quot; to be placed on the album&#x27;s cellophane wrapper in both the vinyl and CD formats. To the right of the &quot;4&quot; is a tiny uppercase letter &quot;P&quot;, in reference to the Four P movement. The following information was supplied by American Recordings in 1994:

&quot;The Four P movement is an alleged Satanic cult operating throughout the United States. An offshoot of the notorious Process Church of the Final Judgment, the Four P movement takes its name from the Process&#x27; original sigil: a swastika-like form composed of four interlocking Ps. The Four P movement was supposedly begun in 1967, and has been connected to a number of ritual killings across the country, including the Son of Sam killings in New York and the Manson Family murders in California.&quot;

In interviews the band members themselves usually refer to the album simply as &quot;Danzig 4&quot;, which is printed on the CD itself, the inlay spine, and the labels on the vinyl LP. In the liner notes to the 2007 compilation &quot;The Lost Tracks of Danzig&quot;, however, Glenn Danzig refers several times to &quot;Danzig 4P&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Danzig 4&quot; was recorded at Ocean Way and Sound City Studios in California.

During the song writing process for the album, Glenn Danzig recorded his basic ideas onto a microcassette. The process continued with Glenn Danzig and John Christ working on guitar parts, before the next stage of Eerie Von and Chuck Biscuits working out their parts of the song arrangements.

The band introduced different instruments and used a few industrial sounds in the background of some tracks. Christ explained &quot;We wanted to introduce some new textures into the band, so we experimented with several older, exotic acoustic instruments, including a harmonium, a recorder and wind chimes.&quot;

Christ also experimented with his guitar sound: &quot;The big difference on this album in terms of my playing is how I use sound and texture. I experimented with several different types of stereo chorusing and pitch-shifting. For example, my tone on &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot; constantly evolves throughout the song.&quot;

Biscuits preferred the drum sound captured on &quot;Danzig 4&quot; to the drum sound on his previous Danzig recordings: &quot;I&#x27;ve had problems with the drum sounds on previous records. They&#x27;ve been too flat, too controlled. In the past, Rick [Rubin] has been into that dry, tight AC/DC sound. This one was looser, with more spaces, more noise.&quot;

The CD release ends with an unlisted hidden thirteenth track. According to an interview with Glenn Danzig, the track is titled &quot;Invocation&quot; and is &quot;about a demon fucking somebody.&quot; The song is inspired by a black mass Danzig claims to have heard at the &quot;Magickal Childe&quot; occult emporium in New York. &quot;Invocation&quot; includes a Gregorian chant, and instrumental tracks that are unique to the song, but reversed, as is Glenn Danzig&#x27;s spoken introduction: &quot;All right, let&#x27;s hear it back&quot;. The track has been described as sounding like a demonic ritual, and Christ described the motivation behind the recording: &quot;People give us a hard time about the &#x27;Devil thing&#x27;, so we figured, &#x27;Let&#x27;s give them something to really talk about&#x27;.&quot; There are several blank tracks before &quot;Invocation&quot;, so that it is numbered track 66. CD players that display the &quot;current track number&quot; and &quot;total disc time elapsed&quot; in minutes thus read &quot;66  61:38&quot; on the display as the final track starts. This is perhaps an intentional reference to The Number of the Beast and the song &quot;We Are 138&quot; that Danzig wrote during his days in the Misfits. &quot;Invocation&quot; is not included on the cassette or vinyl versions of the album.

Although the songs &quot;Crucifixion Destruction&quot; and &quot;White Devil Rise&quot; were mentioned in interviews and articles throughout 1994, with Danzig even discussing the latter in some detail, neither song was included on the final version of the album. Along with another outtake from the same sessions, &quot;The Mandrake&#x27;s Cry&quot;, these were finally released in 2007 on the first disc of &quot;The Lost Tracks of Danzig&quot; (with &quot;Crucifixion Destruction&quot; under its correct title, &quot;Satan&#x27;s Crucifiction&quot;).

==Musical style==
The album is more experimental than its predecessors, and Glenn Danzig described it as &quot;A very challenging record, philosophically, vocally and musically.&quot;

Inspired by accusations that their songs contained hidden Satanic messages, the guitar tracks for &quot;Cantspeak&quot; are those of &quot;Let It Be Captured&quot; played in reverse, as Christ explained: &quot;Eerie Von had the idea of playing one of our songs backwards...we recorded whole guitar solo and drum parts backwards in the songs on this record. In the end we were so obsessed on this that we were trying to really play the whole song &quot;Let It Be Captured&quot; backwards. Therefore, a new song was created - &quot;Cantspeak&quot;.&quot;

Christ explained the song structure of &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot; in more detail: &quot;We actually start out with jazz chords and a funky jazz beat. All of a sudden, we kick into this heavy riff pattern. Then we come back to the original jazz feel, but in a rock version.&quot;

==Themes==

The lyrics to the song &quot;Cantspeak&quot; provide a depiction of helpless desperation.

Glenn Danzig has stated that the song &quot;Going Down to Die&quot; was written about &quot;knowing you&#x27;re gonna die and dying...some people know they&#x27;re going to die. They sense it, and they do die. I&#x27;ve known when other people are going to die, and they died.&quot; He also revealed that at one point there were plans for the song to be included on the &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; film soundtrack.

==Artwork and packaging==
The album cover features artwork by Glenn Danzig. Glenn Danzig has referred to the symbols on the album cover as &quot;Vehmic runes&quot; that spell out &quot;Danzig&quot;. They were taken from the alphabet of a secret tribunal group from Medieval Germany called the Vehmgericht.

The liner notes contain a panoramic picture of the four band members in propped up coffins, flanked by Secret Service men, as a Bill Clinton impersonator shakes hands with a police officer wielding a shotgun. The photo is reminiscent of a 19th-century photograph of dead outlaws on display. Glenn Danzig would later reveal that the FBI considered him a threat to Clinton, the American President at the time of the album release. The liner notes also include a yin yang symbol incorporating the Danzig skull, by artist Michael William Kaluta.

The first pressings of the album were sold in a distinctive cardboard sleeve, which Glenn Danzig claimed was more like that of an old-fashioned LP and more environmentally-friendly than the common plastic CD jewel case. Since this initial release of the album, its cardboard packaging has been replaced by the jewel case.

Like Danzig&#x27;s previous three albums, &quot;Danzig 4&quot; has been labeled with a Parental Advisory (originally in the form of a sticker until the repackaging in the jewel case) since its initial pressings, despite the absence of common profanity.

==Reception==
* &quot;AllMusic&quot; - &quot;Danzig&#x27;s experiments with using texture and atmosphere to evoke their trademark mood of darkness and evil come to the forefront on their fourth full-length album...the music here comes the closest to reflecting the darkness of Glenn Danzig&#x27;s lyrics. Some, however, may miss their more energetic earlier albums.&quot;
* &quot;College Music Journal&quot; - &quot;Maintaining a mysterious, dark and primal attitude seems to come easy to Danzig, as the group proves itself once again on &quot;Danzig 4&quot;. &quot;Danzig 4&quot; is definitely not for the meek.&quot;
* &quot;Q&quot; - &quot;A little more diversity and a significant tightening up of the songwriting quality has resulted in a dark, moody, and at times powerfully evocative album.&quot;
* &quot;Request Magazine&quot; - &quot;The brooding melancholy of &quot;4&quot; never lets up, aided by the stripped-down coproduction of Rick Rubin. The guitar and vocal distortion adds a psychedelic otherworldly touch while bringing the music back to the rawness of Danzig&#x27;s garage-punk roots. A Danzig album is always fascinating because the band sounds like no other in hard rock today.&quot;
* &quot;Trouser Press&quot; - &quot;Dark, sinister, violent, theatrically overstated...Danzig sounds a personal note amid the usual fictional depictions (&quot;Bringer of Death,&quot; &quot;Stalker Song&quot;). &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind the Pain,&quot; &quot;Son of the Morning Star,&quot; &quot;Let It Be Captured&quot; and &quot;Cantspeak&quot; disguise what appear to be mundane feelings of loneliness in grandiose imagery, although that doesn&#x27;t explain the sexual violence of &quot;Little Whip.&quot; Elsewhere, he indulges in a little garden-variety self-deification (&quot;Brand New God,&quot; &quot;Until You Call on the Dark&quot;). The dynamic variety of the long, ambitious record is better than ever, but it&#x27;s an audibly strenuous effort. Too self-conscious by half and sonically thick-skinned where previous albums ripped away flesh, &quot;4&quot; is pure, but not prime, Danzig.&quot;

&quot;Until You Call on the Dark&quot; appears on the 1996 compilation album &quot;Big Ones of Alternative Rock vol. 1&quot;. The black metal band Behemoth recorded a cover version of &quot;Until You Call on the Dark&quot; for their 2005 EP &quot;Slaves Shall Serve&quot;.

==Touring and promotion==
Music videos were released for the songs &quot;Until You Call on the Dark&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind the Pain&quot;, &quot;Cantspeak&quot; and &quot;Sadistikal&quot;.

&quot;Cantspeak&quot; was produced by the underground director Fred Stuhr, known for his work with the band Tool, and uses a mixture of live-action performance and computer-assisted animation. Discussing the video, Stuhr explained &quot;I wanted to create a sense of someone being trapped, someone who can&#x27;t speak. He&#x27;s not alive or dead. He&#x27;s just an ideal, a soul, an existence floating in and out of this time, this reality.&quot; The &quot;Cantspeak&quot; music video appeared on &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;, in the episode &quot;Animation Sucks&quot;.

&quot;Until You Call on the Dark&quot; marked Chuck Biscuits&#x27; final music video appearance with Danzig. The music video was initially rejected by MTV&#x27;s Standards and Practices department due to its lyrical content.

Joey Castillo appears in Biscuits&#x27; place in the music videos for &quot;Cantspeak&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind the Pain&quot;.

All music videos from the album are featured on Danzig&#x27;s &quot;Il Demonio Nera&quot; DVD.

Shortly after the album had been recorded, Biscuits left the band, returned, and was finally fired. Just prior to the album&#x27;s release he was replaced by Joey Castillo. Eerie Von and Christ also intended to leave the band, but decided to stay for the remainder of the tour supporting the album and left the band on July 5 the following year.

<doc id="572242" wikidata="Q351097" url="?curid=572242" title="William Sears (physician)">
<text>William Penton Sears (born December 9, 1939), also referred to as Dr. Bill, is an American pediatrician and the author or co-author of parenting books. Sears is a celebrity doctor and has been a guest on various television talk shows. Sears is a proponent of the attachment parenting philosophy and is most well known for authoring &quot;The Baby Book&quot;, which popularized that style of parenting.

== Early life ==

William Sears was born in Alton, Illinois, the son of Lucille and Willard Sears, an engineer. William&#x27;s father left when he was one month old, after which Lucille moved back in with her parents. His mother raised him as a Catholic, which influenced his later career path and parental theories. After graduating high school, he studied to become a priest at University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary but dropped out due to his desire to raise a family.

After graduating from Saint Louis University in 1962, he enrolled in medical school and began teaching biology at a Catholic school. While studying medicine, he met his wife Martha, who at the time was a nurse at the university. The couple had a total of eight children, one of whom has Down syndrome. Sears cited his experience as a father as inspiration for many of his theories regarding parenting and infant development.

== Career ==
Sears began writing while working as a small-town pediatrician. In 1982, William and Martha published their first book on parenting, although this was later overshadowed by William&#x27;s &quot;The Baby Book&quot; in 1993. The book makes many claims about the importance of attachment parenting, and advocates for breastfeeding and babywearing into toddlerhood. According to Sears, he concluded that babywearing was essential to promoting a healthy bond between mothers and infants after interviewing two women from Zambia at an international parenting conference. Sears later said that he developed many of his ideas after reading Jean Liedloff&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;The Continuum Concept&quot;, which claimed that children raised among the indigenous peoples of South America were more well behaved than their Western counterparts due to be carried constantly during infancy.

After the success of the &quot;Baby Book&quot;, Sears was compared to a pediatrician Benjamin Spock. Sears&#x27; advocacy of co-sleeping&quot;&quot; put him at odds with Richard Ferber who advised parents to let their children self-soothe by crying themselves to sleep. Both authors ended up taking more moderate stances in a 2006 &quot;Day to Day&quot; episode revisiting the dispute, where they conceded that different approaches worked for different parents.

Sears completed medical residencies at Children&#x27;s Hospital Boston and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. In 2004, he was an Associate Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the University of California, Irvine.

He is a medical and parenting consultant for &quot;BabyTalk&quot; and &quot;Parenting&quot; magazines and the pediatrician on the website Parenting.com. Sears has been a guest on various television shows including: 20/20, Donahue, Good Morning America, Oprah Winfrey, CBS This Morning, CNN, Today Show and Dateline.

Sears and his family members are distributors and spokespersons for Juice Plus dietary supplements, which Sears promotes on his website. National Safety Associates (NSA), the company that markets Juice Plus, used testimonials from Bill Sears in advertisements promoting Juice Plus Gummies. In April 2005, the Better Business Bureau&#x27;s National Advertising Division deemed that the ads misleadingly implied &quot;that the Gummies are low in sugar and are a nutritional alternative to fruits and vegetables&quot;. As a result, NSA &quot;promised to modify its ads&quot; and stop calling Gummies &quot;the next best thing to fruits and vegetables.&quot;

Sears operates a &quot;health coach&quot; certification website, The Dr. Sears Wellness Institute.

In 2012, &quot;Time&quot; ran a cover story about the life and legacy of Sears titled &quot;The Man Who Remade Motherhood&quot;, which examined Sears&#x27; life and career.

== Personal life ==
In 1997, Sears was diagnosed with Stage III colon cancer, which went into remission after treatment. Sears and his wife Martha, a registered nurse, have eight children. Three of their children have also become doctors: Jim (the oldest), who is a co-host of &quot;The Doctors&quot;, Bob (second oldest), and Peter.

As of 2009, Sears lives in San Clemente, California, and operates a private medical practice (Sears Family Pediatrics) in Capistrano Beach, California with his sons.

== Reception ==
As of 2012, Sears had published over 40 works, which were translated into 18 languages. Sears&#x27; works promote the practice of attachment parenting, which emphasizes the importance of emotional availability and accessibility.

Sears has been criticized for recommending parenting techniques which are &quot;burdensome&quot; or demanding of parents, particularly mothers whom he recommends stay at home with their infants. Attachment parenting has also been described as a fad by some.

<text>Buford Hayse Pusser (December 12, 1937 – August 21, 1974) was the sheriff of McNairy County, Tennessee from 1964 to 1970 and constable of Adamsville from 1970 to 1972. He is known for his virtual one-man war on moonshining, prostitution, gambling, and other vices along the Mississippi–Tennessee state line. His efforts have inspired several books, songs, movies (most notably &quot;Walking Tall&quot;), and a TV series. He was also a wrestler known as &quot;Buford the Bull&quot; in the Mid-South.

The Buford Pusser Museum was established at the home he lived in at the time of his death in 1974. A Buford Pusser Festival is held each May in his hometown of Adamsville, Tennessee.

==Life and career==
Buford Pusser was born in Finger, McNairy County, Tennessee, on December 12, 1937, the son of Helen (née Harris) and Carl Pusser. His father was the police chief of Adamsville, Tennessee. Buford Pusser was a high-school football and basketball player and was tall. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps when he graduated from high school. His service ended in boot camp, when he was given a medical discharge for asthma.

In 1957, he moved to Chicago, where he was a local wrestler known as &quot;Buford the Bull&quot;. He married Pauline Mullins on December 5, 1959. Pusser returned home in 1962. He was Adamsville&#x27;s police chief and constable from 1962 to 1964. After incumbent sheriff James Dickey was killed in an auto accident, Pusser was elected sheriff of McNairy County, Tennessee, becoming the youngest sheriff in Tennessee&#x27;s history. Pusser promptly began trying to eliminate the Dixie Mafia and the State Line Mob.

Pusser survived several assassination attempts. On February 1, 1966, Louise Hathcock attempted to kill Pusser during an on-site investigation of a robbery complaint at The Shamrock Motel. Hathcock fired on Pusser with a concealed .38 pistol. Pusser returned fire and killed Hathcock. On January 2, 1967, Pusser was shot three times by an unidentified gunman.

While he was already a local hero, Pusser&#x27;s &quot;war&quot; on the State Line Mob was brought to national prominence when his wife, Pauline, was killed on August 12, 1967, during an assassination ambush intended for Pusser and instigated by Hathcock&#x27;s common-law husband. Pusser named Kirksey Nix as the contractor of his wife&#x27;s killers, although neither Nix nor anyone else was ever charged with the crime. Pusser shot and killed an intoxicated Charles Russell Hamilton on December 25, 1968, after responding to a complaint that Hamilton had threatened his landlord with a gun.

Pusser was ineligible for re-election in 1970 due to the term limit then in effect. He was defeated in his bid for sheriff in 1972. Pusser blamed the loss to incumbent Sheriff Clifford Coleman in part on the controversy surrounding the making of the semibiographical movie &quot;Walking Tall.&quot; He was re-elected as constable of Adamsville by a majority of voters, who wrote in his name on their ballots. He served as constable for two more years (1970–1972).

=== Murder of Pauline Pusser ===
According to Pusser, his phone rang before dawn on the morning of August 12, 1967, informing him of a disturbance on New Hope Road in McNairy County; Pusser responded and his wife Pauline rode along. Shortly after they passed the New Hope Methodist Church, a fast-moving car came alongside theirs and the occupants opened fire, killing Pauline and leaving Pusser for dead. Doctors said he was struck on the left side of his jaw by at least two, or possibly three, rounds from a .30-caliber carbine. He spent 18 days in the hospital before returning home, and needed several more surgeries to restore his appearance.

Despite vowing to bring his wife&#x27;s murderers to justice, Pusser was unable to bring Kirksey Nix or any of the accused to trial. Nix was sentenced to the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola for the 1971 Easter Saturday murder of New Orleans grocer Frank J. Corso. While imprisoned, Nix ordered the 1987 murder-for-hire of Judge Vincent Sherry and his wife Margaret, in Biloxi, Mississippi. His conspirator, Biloxi Mayor Pete Halat, had, in his capacity as Nix&#x27;s attorney, stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars that Nix had amassed in a massive lonely hearts scam, blaming it on his law partner, Judge Sherry. Nix was later sentenced to isolation for the rest of his life. According to a 1990 AP story in &quot;The Town Talk&quot;, a newspaper in Alexandria, Louisiana, Nix denied being involved in the drive-by ambush on the Pussers.

On 5 January 2024, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) publicized that the investigation of her murder remained an active case, and requested tips from the public. Following several tips, the TBI confirmed an autopsy had not been performed on Pauline Pusser&#x27;s remains during the course of the original investigation in 1967. In a TBI written statement: &quot;With the support of Pauline’s family and in consultation with 25th Judicial District Attorney General Mark Davidson, TBI requested the exhumation in an attempt to answer critical questions and provide crucial information that may assist in identifying the person or persons responsible for Pauline Pusser’s death.&quot; Her remains were exhumed on 8 February 2024 and reinterred on or around 7 April 2024.

=== Death ===
Pusser died on August 21, 1974, of injuries sustained in a one-car automobile accident four miles west of Adamsville. Earlier that day, he had contracted with Bing Crosby Productions in Memphis to portray himself in the sequel to &quot;Walking Tall&quot;. That evening, returning home alone from the McNairy County Fair in his specially modified Corvette, Pusser struck an embankment at high speed that ejected him from the vehicle. The car caught fire and burned.

Local speculation as to the cause included rumors of sabotage to the steering mechanism and the tie rods. The state trooper who worked the accident, Paul Ervin, later became McNairy County sheriff. Ervin claimed that Pusser&#x27;s death was caused by drunk driving without a seat belt. Buford’s daughter, Dwana Pusser, a passenger in another car, came upon the scene of the accident minutes later. No autopsy of Pusser&#x27;s body was performed. As sheriff, Pusser was credited with surviving seven stabbings and eight shootings. Pusser&#x27;s memorial service was held at the Adamsville Church of Christ.

==In music==
Singer Eddie Bond wrote and recorded several songs honoring Pusser, beginning with &quot;Buford Pusser&quot; in 1968. Many of them were collected on a 1973 LP album, &quot;Eddie Bond Sings the Legend of Buford Pusser&quot;. Pusser himself was also a recording artist, with &quot;It Happened In Tennessee&quot;, released in October 1973 on Stax Records subsidiary Respect. Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers told the story of Pusser&#x27;s battle with organized crime in the songs &quot;The Boys from Alabama&quot;, &quot;Cottonseed&quot;, and &quot;The Buford Stick&quot; from their 2004 album &quot;The Dirty South&quot;. In the songs &quot;The Buford Stick&quot; and &quot;The Boys From Alabama&quot;, they speculated on how criminals might have viewed Pusser.

==Pop culture==

Pusser was the subject of three biographical books written by W.R. Morris: &quot;The Twelfth of August: The Story of Buford Pusser&quot; (1971), &quot;Buford: True Story of &quot;Walking Tall&quot; Sheriff Buford Pusser&quot; (1984), and &quot;The State Line Mob: A True Story of Murder and Intrigue&quot; (1990). In addition, Morris also created a pictorial history book of Buford called &quot;The Legacy of Buford Pusser: A Pictorial History of the &quot;Walking Tall&quot; Sheriff&quot; (1997). Pusser&#x27;s daughter Dwana released a book in 2009 entitled &quot;Walking On&quot;, which is also an account of his life.

The 1973 movie &quot;Walking Tall&quot; was based on Pusser&#x27;s story. It was followed by two sequels in 1975 and 1977, a TV movie in 1978, and a brief TV series in 1981.

A remake by the same title was released in 2004 starring Dwayne Johnson as the main character, renamed Chris Vaughn. After the success of the 2004 film, &quot;Walking Tall: The Payback&quot; was released in 2007 direct-to-video. The name of the main character, who was portrayed by Kevin Sorbo, was changed to Nick Prescott, and the movie was set in the Dallas area. Later that year, on September 25, 2007, Sorbo returned in &quot;Walking Tall: Lone Justice&quot;.

Jimmy Buffett refers to an altercation between Pusser and himself in the songs &quot;Presents To Send You&quot; and &quot;Semi-True Stories&quot; (from the albums &quot;A1A&quot; and &quot;Beach House on the Moon&quot;, respectively). According to Buffett, Pusser and he were staying in the same Nashville motel when Buffett decided to go out for some food and bring it back to the motel. Buffett, who had been drinking, could not find his rental car and decided to climb up on a Cadillac for a better view. That Cadillac turned out to belong to Pusser, who was not at all pleased to find this stranger atop his car. There is also a line in the Buffett song &quot;Close Calls&quot; on the album &quot;Equal Strain on All Parts&quot; that references the altercation with Buford Pusser.

<doc id="572247" wikidata="Q17062474" url="?curid=572247" title="Thieves' World">
<text>Thieves&#x27; World is a shared world fantasy series created by Robert Lynn Asprin in 1978. The original series comprised twelve anthologies, including stories by science fiction and fantasy authors Poul Anderson, John Brunner, Andrew J. Offutt, C. J. Cherryh, Janet Morris, and Chris Morris.

&quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; is set in the city of Sanctuary at the edge of the Rankan Empire. The city is depicted as a place where many are downtrodden and where the invading Rankan gods and the Ilsigi gods they had ousted begin a struggle for dominance. As the series continues, additional invasions occur, and the city is taken over by the snake-worshipping Beysib as the Rankan empire collapses. Over time, a number of the characters in the series are revealed either to be the offspring of or otherwise blessed by various figures in the pantheons of the competing deities, and they discover or develop various powers as the series progresses.

First published in 1979, the series went on hiatus in 1989 after the twelfth anthology. In addition to the official anthologies, several authors published novels set in Thieves&#x27; World.

In 2002, Lynn Abbey, who co-edited several of the original anthologies, relaunched the series with the novel &quot;Sanctuary&quot;. It was followed by the anthologies &quot;Turning Points&quot; and &quot;Enemies of Fortune&quot;, which contain some returning authors and several new ones. Abbey also oversaw the republication of the original anthologies in omnibus editions.

== Concept and origin ==
The &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; anthologies were conceived by authors Robert Lynn Asprin, Lynn Abbey, and Gordon R. Dickson during a casual meeting at the Boston science-fiction convention Boskone in 1978. Asprin suggested that the task of world-building was a major hurdle for modern fantasy writers:

&quot;Whenever one set out to write heroic fantasy, it was first necessary to reinvent the universe from scratch regardless of what had gone before. Despite the carefully crafted Hyborean world of Howard or even the delightfully complex town of Lankhmar which Leiber created, every author was expected to beat his head against the writing table and devise a world of his own. Imagine, I proposed, if our favorite sword-and-sorcery characters shared the same settings and time-frames. Imagine the story potentials.”

Abbey described the 1978 meeting as &quot;a casual conversation [that] changed the lives of a couple dozen people who had no idea what they had been missing or what they were getting into.&quot; The writers who were recruited for the series saw &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; as both a challenge and an opportunity to bring &quot;new oddments of human behavior, new quirks of character that the authors wouldn&#x27;t dare put in a universe for which he or she was solely responsible.&quot;

== Geography ==
Abbey stated that the geography of Sanctuary and its surrounding regions shifted due to each writer&#x27;s needs. &quot;We had Crom-many drugs, magicians, vices, brothels, dives, haunts, curses, and feuds. Sanctuary wasn&#x27;t a provincial backwater; it wasn&#x27;t even the Imperial armpit; it was the Black Hole of not-Calcutta.&quot;

The city itself was envisioned as a late medieval town with similarities to the Shambles in York, England, and additional elements of Baghdad. The faraway capital city of Ranke is based on Rome. &quot;Nobody knows how big Sanctuary really is. Anytime any one of us needs a secret meeting place we just create one – Sanctuary is either very large or very cramped.&quot;

== Storylines and chronology ==
The dynamics of sharing characters led to occasional conflicts between authors, as referenced by C. J. Cherryh in her afterword to &quot;Blood Ties&quot;: &quot;You write your first &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; story for pay, you write your second for revenge.&quot;

In an interview for Green Ronin&#x27;s Sanctuary-based roleplaying guides, Abbey explained the increase of interconnected storylines as the series progressed. &quot;The stories of the first few volumes stood by themselves. But starting in about volume three (&quot;Shadows of Sanctuary&quot;) the authors began collaborating… big time. Eventually just about every author worked with the same plot threads, some of which stretched over several volumes.&quot; Authors would often mine each other&#x27;s stories for plot ideas, with a minor plot point or piece of dialogue turning into a complete story in a subsequent volume.

Asprin addressed the difficulty of the intersecting, overlapping, and diverging timelines in the preface to the fourth collection, &quot;Storm Season&quot;: &quot;While in earlier volumes I have tried to keep the stories in the order in which they occur, this has proved to be impossible in &quot;Storm Season&quot;... I&#x27;ve left it to the reader to understand what is happening and construct his/her mental timeline as necessary.&quot;

Abbey noted that the interwoven plots eventually hurt the series&#x27; readership: &quot;The very plot and character denseness of a &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; volume, while it was eagerly anticipated by long-time readers, was a bit intimidating to anyone who hadn&#x27;t been following the series from the beginning.&quot; Her observation led to a revised approach for the 2002 relaunch. &quot;When we went to work on &#x27;new &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&#x27;,&quot; we tried to find a happy medium between stand-alone stories and densely interwoven plots. In &quot;Turning Points&quot; and &quot;Enemies of Fortune&quot; there are a few events and situations that serve as a backdrop for the stories.&quot;

== Reception and awards ==

=== Industry reactions ===
The &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; anthologies are credited as &quot;pioneering and setting the standard for the shared world format&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts&quot; cites &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; as the &quot;first and protype of the form&quot;.

Science fiction author Cory Doctorow says the series &quot;rocked my world when I was about 13&quot;, and author Robin Hobb called its concept of a collective setting and characters &quot;a brilliant idea&quot;. Author and game designer Robert J. Schwalb said &quot;&quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; is to authors what &quot;D&amp;D&quot; is to gamers.&quot;

Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #1. Costikyan commented that &quot;since fantasy role-playing involves the group production of a multi-hero fantasy story, role-playing fans especially will find &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; enjoyable. [...] The stories themselves range from mediocre to excellent, but all are worth reading.&quot;

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Fantasy&quot; describes the series: &quot;It is in the creation and editorial supervision of the &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; sequence of shared world anthologies ... that Robert Lynn Asprin—in collaboration with Abbey—has done his most original work.&quot;

In the editorial essay included in the second volume, &quot;Tales from the Vulgar Unicorn,&quot; Asprin noted that, though fan response was mostly positive and high sales had led to sequels and the development of the Chaosium board game, many readers had written to the publisher to comment on the series&#x27; overall lack of humor.

==Novels and collections==
Several &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; standalone novels and short stories have been published in addition to the official anthologies.

Janet Morris introduced &quot;The Sacred Band of Stepsons&quot; in &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; and expanded their story in a series of novels about them and their ancient cavalry commander, Tempus. The first three novels in &quot;The Sacred Band of Stepsons&quot; saga were authorized &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot; novels.

<doc id="572253" wikidata="Q3282114" url="?curid=572253" title="Blackacidevil">
<text>Danzig 5: Blackacidevil is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Danzig. It was released in 1996 on Hollywood Records, and was reissued through E-Magine Records in 2000 with three extra tracks. The album sees the band shift to a largely industrial-based sound.

==Background==
The album is the first recorded by Danzig after its departure from producer Rick Rubin&#x27;s record label, American Recordings. It is also the first album recorded after the demise of the &quot;classic&quot; lineup featuring John Christ, Eerie Von, and Chuck Biscuits. Only the band&#x27;s leader Glenn Danzig remained, backed by drummer Joey Castillo, who had joined the band in 1994 immediately after the departure of Chuck Biscuits, after having started as his drum tech, and session bassist Josh Lazie, who had previously toured with Danzig as Eerie Von&#x27;s bass tech. Guitarist Tommy Victor joined the band shortly after &quot;Blackacidevil&#x27;s&quot; completion.

==Music and recording==
On &quot;Blackacidevil&quot;, the band&#x27;s sound shifted from doomy and gothic heavy metal to experimental industrial rock/metal. Glenn Danzig explained: &quot;I wanted to do something that nobody else was really doing. So I took an element of industrial that I liked here, and an element of techno there, then mixed it with what I normally do. I took the best elements of stuff. They&#x27;re powerful when used properly. Then, I&#x27;d still experiment with different directions, which I wanted to do anyway, and then watch what happened when I mixed it together.&quot; On several tracks Danzig applied distortion effects to his vocals.

Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains plays guitar on the tracks &quot;See All You Were&quot;, &quot;Hand of Doom&quot; and &quot;Come to Silver&quot;. This was the first Danzig album to feature Joey Castillo and Josh Lazie, and the only album to feature contributions by Mark Chaussee and Joseph Bishara. Glenn Danzig plays all the instruments on the remainder of the album.

Joseph Bishara described the production of the album: &quot;The way we did it was different from the way records get done, not even taking the time to print time-code and lock-up and do stuff we need to get a programmed kick drum in. A lot of that is me literally playing kick drum in. Now you&#x27;re punching in programming that you&#x27;re playing live. It was a very raw and punk rock way to do electronic.&quot;

Opening song &quot;7th House&quot; is about the theme of &quot;sex and death&quot;. Glenn Danzig recorded his vocal track for the song in a single take.

&quot;Hand of Doom&quot; is a cover of the Black Sabbath song, with new lyrics and musical arrangements by Glenn Danzig. Danzig explained his changes to the original version: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want people to think it&#x27;s just a cover...I started improvising and twisted the words. The melody is still the same, with an industrial kind of groove to the beginning and then the chorus comes in and it&#x27;s full on crazy, with the screaming vocals.&quot; The idea for recording a cover version of the song came during a soundcheck by then-Danzig guitarist John Christ.

Glenn Danzig had originally written &quot;Come to Silver&quot; for Johnny Cash during the recording of &quot;Danzig 4&quot;, although it was never recorded by Cash due to Danzig&#x27;s split from American Recordings. The song addresses the evils of the almighty dollar.

&quot;Sacrifice&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single. According to Glenn Danzig, the song is about &quot;sacrificing yourself throughout your life. It&#x27;s about giving a little more than you should be giving. It&#x27;s not about ritual sacrifice...it&#x27;s more about killing yourself, little by little.&quot; Several different versions of the song, remixed by J. G. Thirlwell, appear on the 1996 &quot;Sacrifice&quot; EP, along with remixes of &quot;Serpentia&quot; and &quot;Deep&quot;.

According to Glenn Danzig, the lyrics to &quot;See All You Were&quot; are &quot;about a love that&#x27;s over...some of it&#x27;s drawn on [personal experience].&quot; The song &quot;Hint of Her Blood&quot; is &quot;about a girl who can only get off when she sees blood, and I didn&#x27;t say her own, either&quot;. &quot;Serpentia&quot; tells of &quot;someone getting into really wild sex for the first time&quot;. The closing track &quot;Ashes&quot; has also been discussed by Glenn Danzig: &quot;It&#x27;s not a depressing song, it&#x27;s a melancholy song. It&#x27;s happy depression, sad and happy at the same time. I don&#x27;t like to say it&#x27;s romantic but it is, everyone has different sides to their personality.&quot;

The song &quot;Deep&quot;, which had been released earlier that year on &quot;The X-Files&quot; television soundtrack, was set to be featured on the album. However, because of Danzig&#x27;s 1996 departure from American Recordings, the song could not be included. Another version of the same song titled &quot;Deeper&quot;, with additional guitar by Tommy Victor, was recorded for the unreleased &quot;Bleedangel&quot; EP, and included as one of three bonus tracks on the 2000 &quot;Blackacidevil&quot; reissue. Of the remaining bonus tracks, &quot;Bleedangel&quot; was recorded as the title track for the unreleased EP, whereas &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot; was recorded during the original &quot;Blackacidevil&quot; sessions and first appeared as a B-side on the &quot;Sacrifice&quot; single.

==Album title==
Danzig has not publicly explained the meaning of the album&#x27;s title. Various theories have been advanced, including it being a play on the phrase &quot;black as a devil&quot;, with the words &quot;black acid devil&quot; (or black acid evil) run together in a portmanteau. Tickets for Danzig&#x27;s Halloween 1996 special $6.66 show at Detroit&#x27;s State Theatre had the phrase &quot;Black Acid Devil&quot; printed on them.

==Artwork and packaging==
The liner notes feature artwork by Joseph Cultice. The re-released version of the album features a new cover by Martin Emond.

Through Danzig&#x27;s new distribution deal with Cleopatra Records, the album was reissued a third time in October of 2021 under Danzig&#x27;s Evilive imprint; in a limited edition of 10,000 CD copies with new artwork and an embossed black slipcase. However, the actual CD enclosed in these copies was actually leftover &quot;new old stock&quot; copies of the original 1996 Hollywood Records pressing.

==Music videos==
Music videos were released for the songs &quot;Sacrifice&quot; and &quot;Serpentia&quot;. All music videos from the album are featured on Danzig&#x27;s &quot;Il Demonio Nera&quot; DVD.

==Reception and controversy==

&quot;Blackacidevil&quot; was widely criticized for its apparent shift in musical direction and was not well received by most critics. Glenn Danzig discussed &quot;Blackacidevil&quot;&#x27;s reception: &quot;That album worked exactly the way I wanted it to, basically, it shook a lot of stuff up. People either loved it or hated it, and we got a lot of new fans from its release. Hey, maybe some of the people who only liked &#x27;Mother&#x27; dropped out, and I&#x27;ve always said those fans are okay, when you get this big MTV exposure, but they&#x27;re not permanent fans. The core following you have is your most important thing.&quot;

Besides the changes in musical direction, &quot;Blackacidevil&quot;&#x27;s original release caused more controversy: Danzig&#x27;s violent music and use of Satanic imagery conflicted with the corporate image projected by Disney, the parent company of Danzig&#x27;s new record label, Hollywood Records. Tower Records&#x27; Pulse! magazine created a mock radio advertisement and a cartoon drawing spoofing this odd relationship. The cartoon featured Glenn Danzig shaking hands with Disney CEO Michael Eisner at the entrance to &quot;Danzigland&quot; (instead of Disneyland) with the two surrounded by skulls, a child wearing a &quot;666&quot; T-shirt and a horned and fanged Mickey Mouse. As a result of the controversy, the label pulled support for the album and the record deal was severed. &quot;Blackacidevil&quot; was the only Danzig release on the Hollywood Records label. The master rights reverted back to Danzig soon afterward, laying the groundwork for a 2000 reissue on E-Magine, and a later 2021 limited edition reissue (which was actually a repackaged leftover pressing of the original Hollywood pressing) on Danzig&#x27;s own Evilive label via Cleopatra Records.

<doc id="572255" wikidata="Q1194051" url="?curid=572255" title="Walking Tall (1973 film)">
<text>Walking Tall is a 1973 American neo-noir biographical vigilante action film based on the life of Buford Pusser, a professional wrestler-turned-lawman in McNairy County, Tennessee, played by Joe Don Baker. The film was directed by Phil Karlson. It has become a cult film with two direct sequels of its own, a TV movie, a brief TV series and a remake that had its own two sequels.

==Plot==
Buford Pusser, at his wife Pauline&#x27;s behest, retires from the professional wrestling ring, and moves back to Tennessee to start a logging business with his father Carl Pusser. With a friend, Pusser visits a gambling and prostitution establishment The Lucky Spot, and is beaten up after catching the house cheating at craps. Pusser is seriously injured with a knife and receives over 200 stitches. He complains to the sheriff, but is ignored, and soon becomes aware of the rampant corruption in McNairy County.

Later, working at his father&#x27;s lumber mill, Pusser makes a club out of a tree branch. Late one night, Pusser waits until after The Lucky Spot is closed, and beats up the same thugs who left him for dead. The next day, Pusser is arrested; he represents himself at trial. At one point, he rips off his shirt and shows the jury his scars. He informs them, &quot;If you let them do this to me and get away with it, then you&#x27;re giving them the eternal right to do the same damn thing to any one of you!&quot; The jury finds Pusser not guilty, and he decides to clean up the county, and runs for sheriff. The campaign against the incumbent sheriff is contentious, who is killed trying to run Pusser off the road.

Pusser is elected, and becomes famous for being incorruptible and intolerant of crime, and for his array of four-foot hickory clubs, which he uses to great effect in dispatching criminals and destroying their clandestine gambling dens and illegal distilleries. Some residents praise Pusser as an honest cop in a crooked town; others denounce him as a bully willing to break some laws to uphold others. Pusser is betrayed by one of his deputies, and is attacked several times. Finally, Pauline and Pusser are ambushed in their car. Pauline is killed and Pusser is seriously injured.

Pusser is admitted to the hospital after being shot, and while still in a neck-and-face cast, attends his wife&#x27;s funeral. Afterward, Pusser rams a sheriff cruiser through the front doors of The Lucky Spot, killing two of his would-be assassins. As Pusser leaves with two deputies, the townspeople arrive and begin throwing the gambling tables out into the parking lot. They light a bonfire as an overwhelmed Pusser wipes tears from his eyes.

==Cast==
==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Walking Tall&quot; was a box-office smash. Produced on a budget of $500,000, the film grossed over $40 million, earning $10 million in theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada. The film played in rural areas before moving to larger cities, starting off slowly, but becoming a success through word-of-mouth.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on reviews from 12 critics. On Metacritic, it has a score of 60% based on reviews from seven critics.

Andrew Sarris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote: &quot;Like it or not, &quot;Walking Tall&quot; is saying something very important to many people, and it is saying it with accomplished artistry. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that, despite disliking the film, whose final scene he likened to &quot;a nice KKK bonfire,&quot; he could &quot;admire the manner in which it manipulates its audience through various notable clichés.&quot; Judith Crist of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Walking Tall&quot; grabs you where trash and violence invariably do, with excellent performers, shrewd plotting, and pacing.&quot;
Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, writing in 2002, describes the film as &quot;an ultraviolent revenge fantasy&quot; and &quot;a masterpiece of over-the-top unintentional hilarity&quot; and highly recommends the film, calling it an &quot;unconscionably good time&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains
** Buford Pusser – Nominated Hero

==Sequels==
The original &quot;Walking Tall&quot; was a hit, but the sequels, &quot;Walking Tall Part 2&quot; (September 28, 1975), and &quot;Walking Tall: Final Chapter&quot; (August 10, 1977), both starring Bo Svenson, were far less profitable.

==Remake==

On December 9, 1978, CBS aired a television movie titled &quot;A Real American Hero: Buford Pusser&quot;, starring Brian Dennehy as the title character. The film is set in 1967 and focused on real-life Sheriff Buford Pusser, who goes after a criminal who has killed young people with his illegal moonshine.
In 2004, a remake starring professional wrestler Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson was made. Although it used elements from Pusser&#x27;s life and the original &quot;Walking Tall&quot;, many things were changed. Johnson&#x27;s character&#x27;s name was now Chris Vaughn, the sheriff is trying to stop the selling of illegal drugs instead of illegal moonshine, and the film&#x27;s setting became semirural Kitsap County, Washington, although it was filmed in Squamish, British Columbia, Canada. Two sequels to the remake were produced, and released in 2007: &quot;Walking Tall: The Payback&quot; and &quot;Walking Tall: Lone Justice&quot;, both made in Dallas, Texas, and released directly to DVD. These sequels starred Kevin Sorbo as Nick Prescott, the son of the town&#x27;s sheriff, who takes the law into his own hands when his father is killed in a suspicious car accident.

<doc id="572270" wikidata="Q1475521" url="?curid=572270" title="Iveragh Peninsula">
<text>The Iveragh Peninsula () is located in County Kerry in Ireland. It is the largest peninsula in southwestern Ireland. A mountain range, the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks, lies in the centre of the peninsula. Carrauntoohil, its highest mountain, is also the highest peak in Ireland.

==Geography==
Towns on the peninsula include Killorglin, Cahersiveen, Ballinskelligs, Portmagee, Knightstown, Waterville, Caherdaniel, Sneem and Kenmare.

The Ring of Kerry, a popular tourist trail, circles the coastlines as well as the Skellig Ring, beginning and ending at Killarney, just east of the peninsula.

Valentia Island lies off the northwestern tip of the peninsula. It is connected with the peninsula by a bridge at Portmagee village, but it can also be reached by ferry crossing between Renard Point on the mainland and Knightstown on the island.

The Skellig Islands lie about 12 kilometres (7.5 statute miles or 6.4 nautical miles) off the west coast and are known for their monastic buildings and bird life. Since 2015 the filming of Star Wars has brought many new tourists to the area.

Kerry Geopark is a community initiative on the Iveragh Peninsula which aims to promote geotourism in this area of high geological importance. Some of the interest features are Kenmare Bay (a drowned river valley or ria), signs of past glaciation and volcanic activity and 400-million-year-old fossilised tetrapod tracks.

Cloghanecarhan, a ringfort with ogham stone, is a National Monument; as is Leacanabuaile, a stone ringfort (cashel).

Loher Cashel, a stone ringfort (&quot;caiseal&quot;) is located at the western edge of Iveragh.

The Iveragh Peninsula has also been home to the Kerry International Dark-Sky Reserve since 2014.
== Gaeltacht ==
The Iveragh Gaeltacht or Gaeltacht Uíbh Ráthaigh is one of the smallest of the Gaeltachts. The main town is Baile an Sceilg and smaller villages and townlands include Dún Géagáin, Cíllin Liath, Lóthar and Cuan an Chaisleáin. It is sparsely populated and According to the 2016 Census, there were 1,753 people over the age of three living in the Iveragh Gaeltacht, With only 6.9% claiming to speak Irish on a daily basis outside the education system. This makes it the 5th weakest Gaeltacht out of 26 in Ireland by rate of daily speakers.

The Iveragh Gaeltacht was one of the strongest in the country at one point. People of all classes spoke the language, with over 93% of the population monolingual Irish speakers in the 1850s. The entire Peninsula was designated as a Gaeltacht when they were first drawn in the 1920s. By the 1980s the percentage of people able to speak Irish in the official Gaeltacht area that was drawn in 1956 was around 60% and has remained at about that level ever since.

A comprehensive linguistic study of the Gaeltachts published in 2007 recommended that the Iveragh Gaeltacht be categorized as a class C Gaeltacht.

The percentage of daily speakers along with the population have been falling consistently. Between 1956 and 2011 the population of the Iveragh Gaeltacht declined from 3,036 to 1,795. A decrease of 41%. This is despite a 67% increase of the Irish population in that same timeframe. Many of the townlands in the centre of the peninsula where much of the Gaeltacht is located are uninhabitated. The lack of basic services is cited as one of the main reasons for the dramatic decline in population and by extension the irish speaking population. The lack of many Gaelscoileanna in the area is probably another reason for the decline of the Irish language.

&quot;Comhchoiste Ghaeltacht Uíbh Ráthaigh&quot; is a community group established in 1998 to act as an umbrella for the development groups in the 5 Gaeltacht areas on the Iveragh Peninsula. The organisation is involved in many things including promoting the Irish language and developing community projects.

==Prehistoric rock art==
The Iveragh Peninsula is host to one of the highest concentrations of Atlantic rock art in Ireland. The art is scattered throughout the peninsula but the greatest prevalence is found in two main clusters, the most notable and well recorded being the adjoining townlands of Derrynablaha and Derreeny near Sneem. The art of these townlands attracted international attention in the 1960’s when Professor Emanuel Anati recorded the art, alongside E. Shee and M.J O’ Kelly. The second cluster of rock art is on the adjoining townlands of Coomasaharn, Kealduff Upper and Letter West, near Glenbeigh. These townlands are host to hundreds of individual examples of the Atlantic art form, with new examples being added to the archaeological record regularly by archaeologists and enthusiasts.

<text>Danzig 777: I Luciferi () is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Danzig. It was released on May 21, 2002 by Glenn Danzig&#x27;s Evilive label and distributed by Spitfire Records. Danzig stated that this album was the last in a series of seven numbered albums, each with its own general concept.

Over the months following the tour for this album, each of the other band members left to pursue other projects. Most notably, Joey Castillo joined Queens of the Stone Age; he appeared on Danzig&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Black Laden Crown&quot; (2017), but did not officially rejoin Danzig.

==Music and recording==
The song &quot;Angel Blake&quot; is named after the witch in the film &quot;The Blood on Satan&#x27;s Claw&quot;.

The track &quot;Wicked Pussycat&quot; served as the album&#x27;s first single.

The original track listing, as reported by KNAC on December 22, 2001, featured several tracks that did not appear on the final album. These included the songs &quot;Dying Seraph&quot;, &quot;Soul Eater&quot;, and &quot;Malefical Bride of Hell&quot;, all of which were released in 2007 on &quot;The Lost Tracks of Danzig&quot;, with &quot;Malefical Bride of Hell&quot; having its title shortened to &quot;Malefical&quot;. An additional track titled &quot;Dark Secret Side&quot; has never been released.

==Album title==
In a 2002 interview with Juliya Chernetsky on Fuse TV&#x27;s &quot;Uranium&quot; show, Glenn Danzig said that the pronunciation of the album title is . This corresponds to Danzig&#x27;s pronunciation of the word in the chorus of the title track. Early press releases for the album reveal that its working title was &quot;Danzig 7: Kiss the Skull&quot;.

==Artwork and packaging==
The CD booklet contains a quotation from Celsus, a second-century AD opponent of Christianity: &quot;They worship neither a god nor even a demon, but a dead man!&quot;

Porn star Devon appears in the CD booklet and on the back of the CD jacket.

The lyric sheet for the song &quot;Black Mass&quot; contains a misprint: &quot;Asan un Nefer&quot;. The correct lyric is &quot;Asar-un-Nefer&quot; (&quot;Myself Made Perfect&quot;), an epithet of the Egyptian god Osiris used especially in the Thelemic &quot;Bornless Ritual&quot;. Earlier in the song, Danzig&#x27;s lyrics refer to &quot;the Bornless One&quot;.

The lyrics for &quot;Wicked Pussycat&quot; contain an omission. The correct missing lyric is &quot;five-pointed star-tail&quot;: as the lyric is repeated at one point in the video for the song, the camera focuses on the tail/chain of a girl&#x27;s cat costume; at the end of the chain is a pentagram.

==Reception==
* &quot;Allmusic&quot; – &quot;Uneven as &quot;I Luciferi&quot; is, it&#x27;s a quite listenable and welcome return to truly metallic form for Glenn Danzig...Sure, his best years are most likely behind him at this point, but &quot;I Luciferi&quot; proves that this old snake still has some venom left in his fangs.&quot;
* &quot;Punknews.org&quot; – &quot;This album is extremely dark and heavy, as you might expect...The best thing about this album is that it is devoid of filler, the hard smacks just keep coming and don&#x27;t stop &#x27;till the end.&quot;
* &quot;LA Weekly&quot; – &quot;Controlled, relentless darkness and passion. Great song after great song. Forget the muscles and skulls, this is hard-rock &quot;music&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;Blistering&quot; – &quot;The effect-laden focus of the previous two albums is long gone, with only hints of the old industrial sound remaining...There isn’t a weak moment on the album. This one has got it all. If you have left the Danzig circle, it’s time to return.&quot;

==Music videos==
Music videos were released for the songs &quot;Kiss the Skull&quot; and &quot;Wicked Pussycat&quot;.

The video for &quot;Kiss the Skull&quot; was directed by Thomas Mignone, who has also directed live action videos for Verotik. The &quot;devil fetus&quot; that appears in the video was designed by Glenn Danzig.

<text>The Hospital for Sick Children (HSC), corporately branded as SickKids, is a major pediatric teaching hospital located on University Avenue in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Toronto, the hospital was ranked the top pediatric hospital in the world by &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 2021. The hospital&#x27;s Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning is the largest pediatric research tower in the world, at .

==History==

During 1875, an eleven-room house was rented for a year by a Toronto women&#x27;s bible study group, led by Elizabeth McMaster. Opened on March 1, it set up six iron cots and &quot;declared open a hospital &#x27;for the admission and treatment of all sick children.&#x27;&quot; The first patient, a scalding victim named Maggie, came in on April 3. In its first year of operation, 44 patients were admitted to the hospital, and 67 others were treated in outpatient clinics.

In 1876, the hospital moved to larger facilities. In 1891, it moved from rented premises to a purposely-constructed building at College and Elizabeth Streets. It would remain there for 60 years. The building, known as the Victoria Hospital for Sick Children, is now the Toronto area headquarters of Canadian Blood Services. In 1951, the hospital moved to its present University Avenue location. On its grounds once stood the childhood home of the Canadian-born movie star Mary Pickford.

In 1972, the hospital became equipped with a rooftop helipad (CNW8).

From 1980 to 1981, the hospital was the site of a series of baby deaths.

In December 2022, the hospital was attacked by the LockBit ransomware gang, who apologized 13 days later and provided a decryptor to the hospital for free.

==Contributions to medicine==
The hospital was an early leader in the fields of food safety and nutrition. In 1908, a pasteurization facility for milk was established at the hospital, the first in Toronto, 30 years before milk pasteurization became mandatory. Researchers at the hospital invented an infant cereal, Pablum. The research that led to the discovery of insulin took place at the nearby University of Toronto and was soon applied in the hospital by Gladys Boyd. Dr. Frederick Banting, one of the researchers, had served his internship at the hospital and went on to become an attending physician there. In 1963, William Thornton Mustard developed the Mustard surgical procedure to help correct heart problems in blue baby syndrome. In 1989, a team of researchers at the hospital discovered the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis.

SickKids is a member of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), the world&#x27;s largest advocacy organization representing the biotechnology industry.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, SickKids engaged in several campaigns to promote COVID-19 vaccines. 

SickKids received $99,680.00 from the Government of Canada for two projects through a grant program titled &quot;Encouraging vaccine confidence in Canada.&quot; The grant was jointly administered by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).

One of the funded proposals was titled “Building COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence: Educating the Educators.” The result was a promotional video titled “COVID-19 Vaccination Information for Education &amp; Child Care Sector Staff” narrated by Dr. Danielle Martin. It was produced by 19 to Zero, and distributed by the Ontario Ministry of Education to school boards, private schools and child care centres to use in COVID-19 vaccination educational programs. 

A second proposal was titled “Stop COVID in Kids - School based vaccine education outreach to build trust and empower families”, which received additional funding in the form of a $440,000 grant from the Public Health Agency of Canada&#x27;s Immunization Partnership Fund.

== Alleged baby murders ==
In 1980-81, up to 29 baby deaths at SickKids were suspected to have been deliberate murders by a nurse using the heart medication digoxin. However, after years of inquiry it remains unclear if any murders actually took place or if toxicological tests were misinterpreted. In 2024, retired SickKids paediatric intensive care specialist Dr. Desmond Bohn, who took the latter position, pointed to similarities in the British Lucy Letby case.

==Unqualified forensic testing==
The hospital housed the Motherisk Drug Testing Laboratory. At the request of various child protection agencies, 16,000 hair samples were tested from 2005 to 2015. The former Ontario Appeal Court judge Susan Lang reviewed Motherisk Drug Testing Laboratory and determined that it was not qualified to do forensic testing. Lang also stated, &quot;That SickKids failed to exercise meaningful oversight over MDTL&#x27;s work must be considered in the context of the hospital&#x27;s experience with Dr. Charles Smith.&quot; The 2008 Goudge Report found also that Dr. Charles Smith, whose forensic testimony led to wrongful convictions in the deaths of children, was not qualified to do forensic testing.

==Future==
The hospital is in its initial stages of expansion. In 2017, it established the &quot;SickKids VS Limits&quot; fundraising campaign, which continued until 2022 to raise $1.5 billion for the expansion project. The funds will be used to build a patient care centre on University Avenue and a support centre on Elizabeth Street, to renovate the atrium, and to fund pediatric health research.

To provide the required area for the buildings, demolition of existing structures was required. That included the removal of a skyway spanning Elizabeth Street, the demolition of the Elizabeth McMaster Building at the northeast corner of Elizabeth Street and Elm Street, and the demolition of the laboratory and administrative building.

Construction of the 22-storey Patient Support Centre administrative building occurred on the site of the Elizabeth McMaster Building. Groundbreaking took place in October 2019, topping out took place in September 2022, and it opened in September 2023. The Peter Gilgan Family Patient Care Tower is expected to open in 2029, and the atrium&#x27;s renovation is expected to be completed by 2031.

<text>51 Pegasi (abbreviated 51 Peg), formally named Helvetios , is a Sun-like star located from Earth in the constellation of Pegasus. It was the first main-sequence star found to have an exoplanet (designated 51 Pegasi b, officially named Dimidium) orbiting it.

==Properties==

The star&#x27;s apparent magnitude is 5.49, making it visible with the naked eye under suitable viewing conditions.

51 Pegasi was listed as a standard star for the spectral type G2IV in the 1989 &quot;The Perkins catalog of revised MK types for the cooler stars&quot;. Historically, it was generally given a stellar classification of G5V, and even in more modern catalogues it is usually listed as a main-sequence star. The NStars project assign it a G2V spectral class. It is generally considered to still be generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core, but to be in a more evolved state than the Sun. The effective temperature of the chromosphere is about , giving 51 Pegasi the characteristic yellow hue of a G-type star. It is estimated to be about 4.8 billion years old, about the same age as the Sun, with a radius 11.5% larger and 9% more mass. The star has a higher proportion of elements other than hydrogen/helium compared to the Sun; a quantity astronomers term a star&#x27;s metallicity. Stars with higher metallicity such as this are more likely to host giant planets. In 1996, astronomers Baliunas, Sokoloff, and Soon measured a rotational period of 37 days for 51 Pegasi.

Although the star was suspected of being variable during a 1981 study, subsequent observation showed there was almost no chromospheric activity between 1977 and 1989. Further examination between 1994 and 2007 showed a similar low or flat level of activity. This, along with its relatively low X-ray emission, suggests that the star may be in a Maunder minimum period during which a star produces a reduced number of star spots.

The star rotates at an inclination of 79 degrees relative to Earth.

==Nomenclature==
51 Pegasi is the Flamsteed designation. On its discovery, the star&#x27;s planet — and actually the first exoplanet discovered around a main-sequence star — was designated 51 Pegasi b by its discoverers and unofficially dubbed Bellerophon, in keeping with the convention of naming planets after Greek and Roman mythological figures (Bellerophon was a figure from Greek mythology who rode the winged horse Pegasus).

In July 2014, the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the names of Helvetios for this star and Dimidium for its planet.

The names were those submitted by the Astronomische Gesellschaft Luzern, Switzerland. &quot;Helvetios&quot; is Latin for &quot;the Helvetian&quot; and refers to the Celtic tribe that lived in Switzerland during antiquity; &#x27;Dimidium&#x27; is Latin for &#x27;half&#x27;, referring to the planet&#x27;s mass of at least half the mass of Jupiter.

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

==Planetary system==
On October 6, 1995, Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz announced the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting 51 Pegasi. The discovery was made at Observatoire de Haute-Provence in France. On 8 October 2019, Mayor and Queloz shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery.

51 Pegasi b (51 Peg b) was the first discovered exoplanet around a main-sequence star. It orbits very close to the star, experiences estimated temperatures around and has a mass at least half that of Jupiter. At the time of its discovery, this close distance was not compatible with theories of planet formation and resulted in discussions of planetary migration. However, several hot Jupiters are now known to be oblique relative to the stellar axis.

<doc id="572300" wikidata="Q4920283" url="?curid=572300" title="Black Aria">
<text>Black Aria is an instrumental album composed by Glenn Danzig, the vocalist/songwriter for Danzig and previously of Samhain and the Misfits. It was released in 1992, and is Danzig&#x27;s first album as a solo artist. 

The mostly instrumental album is a departure from Danzig&#x27;s earlier work in metal and punk rock, and debuted at number 1 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; classical chart. The original release was on Glenn Danzig&#x27;s own label, Plan 9 Records, and like his Misfits and Samhain releases, was distributed by Caroline Records. The album was reissued in 2000 on E-Magine Records, and a sequel followed on Evilive Records in 2006. A third reissue occurred, again on Danzig&#x27;s Evilive label in conjunction with Cleopatra Records, in July 2023, along with &quot;Black Aria II.&quot;

==Music and recording==
The album is largely modern instrumental classical music, and is very dark, with gothic metal tendencies.

Although it was not released until 1992, some of the material on the album was recorded as early as 1987. Select tracks from the album had served as intro music to early Danzig shows, and excerpts of some songs were included on Danzig&#x27;s first two compilation home videos released by Def American Recordings in 1989 and 1991.

The first six song titles reference a soundtrack to John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, which describes Lucifer&#x27;s rebellion from the Christian God, and his subsequent expulsion from Heaven with the angels who joined him. The final three tracks, written by Danzig while he was still in Samhain, reference Celtic mythology. &quot;The Morrigu&quot; relates to The Morrígan, a mythical phantom queen. &quot;Cwn Annwn&quot; refers to the spectral hounds of the same name.

All tracks were written by Glenn Danzig, who also performed all instruments. Engineering was provided by Nick Didia, Martin Schmelze, and Bob Alecca. Female voices were provided by Janna Brown and Reneé Rubach.

==Artwork and packaging==
The photograph of Glenn Danzig in the liner notes was taken by Anton Corbijn. The album&#x27;s front cover is by renowned comic book and graphic artist Michael William Kaluta, who also drew the interior illustrations for Danzig&#x27;s fourth album.

As the musical content of &quot;Black Aria&quot; is a departure from the music of the band Danzig, the album has a written disclaimer to warn buyers that it is not a rock record.

<doc id="572302" wikidata="Q2557355" url="?curid=572302" title="Université de Moncton">
<text>The Université de Moncton is a Canadian francophone university in New Brunswick. It includes campuses in Edmundston, Moncton, and Shippagan.

The university was founded in 1963 following the recommendations of the royal commission on higher education in New Brunswick. Since then, the institution has been widely regarded as the heir to several Acadian institutions of higher learning such as the Collège Saint-Joseph.

The university offers training and research in the fields of business, arts, social sciences, law, engineering, sciences, health, social work, community services and education. 

As of January 2024, the university has 5,244 full-time registrations and 552 part-time registrations. Students come from New Brunswick, other provinces in Canada and internationally. The University offers nearly 198 programs in the three cycles of study.

==History==
The Université de Moncton was born because of recommendations made in 1962 by a Commission of Inquiry on Higher Education in New Brunswick chaired by John J. Deutsch. The new university was created on June 19, 1963. Collège Saint-Joseph, the Université Sacré-Cœur in Bathurst, and the Université Saint-Louis d&#x27;Edmundston agreed to suspend their respective charters and assume the status of affiliated colleges (Collège Saint-Joseph, Collège de Bathurst, and Collège Saint-Louis). The new Université de Moncton took shape on land in Moncton&#x27;s Sunny Brae neighbourhood.

In 1972, Collège Jésus-Marie in Shippagan was affiliated directly with the Université de Moncton and offered the first two years of the arts program.

Following recommendations made in 1975 by the Committee on Higher Education in the Francophone Sector in New Brunswick, chaired by Justice Louis A. LeBel, the Université de Moncton underwent a major reorganization. In 1977, the Université de Moncton became a university composed of three equal campuses, located in the three major francophone regions of the province: Edmundston, Moncton, and Shippagan. Collège Jésus-Marie became the Centre universitaire de Shippagan, campus de l’Université de Moncton, and Collège Saint-Louis-Maillet became the Centre universitaire Saint-Louis-Maillet, campus de l’Université de Moncton. Moncton was named the Centre universitaire de Moncton, campus de l&#x27;Université de Moncton.

The current designations since 1994 of the three constituents of the Université de Moncton are: (1) Université de Moncton, campus d&#x27;Edmundston (UMCE), (2) Université de Moncton, campus de Moncton (UMCM) and (3) Université de Moncton, campus de Shippagan (UMCS).

==Campuses==
The university is divided into three campuses:

The Moncton Campus is home to more than 70% of the students and offers all programs, except for some programs that are only available at the Edmundston and Shippagan Campuses. Located in the north of the city, the Moncton Campus includes some twenty pavilions, the CEPS Louis-J.-Robichaud sports center, the J.-Louis-Lévesque arena, the Musée acadien, the Louise-et-Ruben-Cohen Art Gallery, and several residences and apartments to meet the needs of students (rooms, studios, and university apartments).

The Campus Universitaire d&#x27;Edmundston, in Edmundston (Edmundston Campus) is built on an elevated area of the downtown core, near the Trans-Canada Highway. It has four pavilions, a student center and a residence. The Pavillon sportif d&#x27;Edmundston is located on the campus grounds and includes a swimming pool, a climbing wall, different gymnasiums and more. A 2,400-seat amphitheatre used for field hockey and shows is also located next to the Pavillon sportif. Outside, there is a six-lane athletic field with bleachers.

The Shippagan Campus is located in northeastern New Brunswick. It includes four pavilions: the Irène-Léger Pavilion, the Bibliothèque, Sciences et technologies Pavilion, the Zone côtière Pavilion and the Armand-Caron Sports Pavilion. It also has the Institut de recherche sur les zones côtières VALORĒS, and four university housing buildings. The Shippagan regional pool is attached to the Armand-Caron Sports Pavilion. 

==Faculties==
The Université de Moncton offers nearly 198 programs:

# Faculty of Administration &quot;(Administration)&quot;
# Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences &quot;(Arts et des sciences sociales)&quot;
# Law &quot;(Droit)&quot;
# Engineering &quot;(Ingénierie)&quot;
# Science &quot;(Sciences)&quot;
# Health Sciences and Community Services &quot;(Sciences de la santé et des services communautaires)&quot;
# Education &quot;(Sciences de l&#x27;éducation)&quot;
# Forestry School &quot;(École de foresterie)&quot;
# Information Management and Sustainable Development and Coastal Zone (&quot;Gestion de l’information et développement durable et zone côtière&quot;)

Not all faculties offer programs on each campus. In many cases, students may take the first year of a program at the Edmundston or Shippagan Campuses before having to transfer to the Moncton Campus. The School of Forestry &quot;(École de foresterie)&quot; offers courses at the Edmundston Campus only, while the Sustainable development and Coastal Zone &quot;(Développement durable et zone côtière)&quot; and Information Management &quot;(Gestion de l&#x27;information)&quot; are only offered at the Shippagan Campus. The first year of the Nursing program at the Shippagan Campus is followed by three years in Bathurst.

The Université de Moncton offers a range of studies at the graduate certificate, graduate diploma, master&#x27;s and doctoral levels. The Moncton Campus is also the home of the medical training program run by the Université de Sherbrooke.

==Libraries==

There are six libraries and ressource centres across the three campuses: Bibliothèque Champlain (Moncton), Bibliothèque de droit Michel-Bastarache (Moncton), Centre d&#x27;études acadiennes Anselme-Chiasson (Moncton), Centre de ressources pédagogiques (Moncton), Bibliothèque Rhéa-Larose (Edmundston) and Bibliothèque Aldéa-Landry (Shippagan). 

Two of these libraries, Bibliothèque de droit Michel-Bastarache and Centre de ressources pédagogiques, are special libraries, catering to the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Education, respectively. The Centre d&#x27;études acadiennes Anselme-Chiasson, found on the lower level of Bibliothèque Champlain, is a primary resource and archive centre for Acadian studies.

==Student life and athletics==
Many social and physical activities are offered, such as live performances, music, movies, theater, student radio, improvisation, student councils, swimming pool, racquetball and squash courts, gym, fitness rooms and more.

The Université de Moncton is represented by nine teams in various sports leagues in the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) and U Sports (formerly: Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS)). They compete under the name Aigles Bleus and Aigles Bleues. The university is represented by men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams for hockey, soccer, athletics, and cross-country running. It also has a women&#x27;s volleyball team.

The Croix-Bleue Medavie Stadium, located on the Moncton campus, seats 10,000 to 20,000. It allows the Université de Moncton to host major sporting and recreational events. It was inaugurated in 2010.

Codiac FM is the student radio station on campus, previously CKUM-FM.

<text>Kim Ku (; August 29, 1876 – June 26, 1949), also known by his art name Paekpŏm, was a Korean politician. He was a leader of the Korean independence movement against the Empire of Japan, head of the Korean Provisional Government from 1926 to 1927 and from 1940 to 1945, and a Korean reunification activist after 1945. Kim is revered in South Korea, where he is considered one of the greatest figures in Korean history; his legacy is also somewhat less enthusiastically celebrated in North Korea, due to his anti-communist views.

Born in Haeju, Hwanghae Province, Joseon, to a poor farming family, Kim was involved in the Donghak Peasant Revolution in 1894. In 1896, he murdered a Japanese man whom he believed was connected to the assassination of Empress Myeongseong (though he is now generally agreed to be a civilian merchant), for which he was imprisoned until escaping in 1898. Kim was briefly a Buddhist monk before becoming a Christian and teacher in 1903. In 1911, he was arrested in connection with the 105-Man Incident and was again imprisoned until 1914. In 1919, he participated in the March First Movement against the Japanese. While in exile in the Republic of China, he helped found the Korean Provisional Government, and served as its president from 1926 to 1927 and from 1940. Kim also founded and led several other organizations, including the Korean Independence Party, Korean Patriotic Organization, and Korean Liberation Army.

After the surrender of Japan in World War II, Kim returned to Korea in 1945 as head of the provisional government. Kim became a critic of Syngman Rhee, the U.S.&#x27;s preferred candidate for leader of South Korea, and made efforts to prevent a permanent division of Korea. Defying the wishes of Rhee and the U.S., he went to Pyongyang to hold unification talks with Kim Il Sung, but was unable to reach an agreement. He fiercely opposed the establishment of separate states in North and South Korea, which took place in 1948. In 1949, before the outbreak of the Korean War, Kim was assassinated by army officer Ahn Doo-hee.

==Early life==
Kim was born Kim Ch&#x27;angam, on August 29, 1876, in T&#x27;otkol village, Paegunbang, Haeju, Hwanghae Province, Joseon. He was the only child of two farmers: mother Kwak Nak-won and father Kim Sunyŏng.

Kim&#x27;s family was impoverished, poorly educated, and looked down upon by the community. His father belonged to the formerly (upper-class) Andong Kim clan. However, the clan had lost its noble status in 1651, when its member Kim Ja-jeom fell from grace. Ja-jeom&#x27;s direct descendants became slaves, and the rest of the Andong clan became commoners.

At age two, Kim suffered from smallpox, leaving him with scars on his face.

His family placed great emphasis on his education in order to have him escape poverty. When he was around nine years old, his parents moved to place him in a local (school) in preparation for the , the demanding civil service examinations that determined placement in government intellectual jobs. However, schools rejected him on the basis of his lower class, so he eventually began his education at age twelve with a tutor that was willing to teach him.

In 1888, the father of 12-year-old Kim suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed. Desperate to cure him, Kim&#x27;s mother sold off all of the family&#x27;s belongings, including silverware, and left Kim Ku at a relative&#x27;s house while she took her husband around the province in search of a doctor. Kim paid for his accommodations by cutting and carrying wood during this time. Kim&#x27;s father eventually somewhat recovered, and was able to walk on his own, albeit with difficulty. The family then struggled to pay for Kim&#x27;s school supplies, so his mother worked to afford them by weaving and working as a hired farm hand.

In 1892, at the age of 16, Kim took the but failed. He reportedly witnessed and was frustrated by the elite candidates engaging in cheating and bribes. He quit studying at the and spent three months studying philosophical and military texts on his own and reflecting on his life.

== Activities before Japanese occupation (1893–1905) ==

=== Donghak Revolution (1893–1894) ===

In January 1893, Kim joined the Donghak movement after traveling to meet its leader, in Podong. The movement was created in 1860 in reaction to the instability of Joseon in the 19th century and the spread of foreign influence and religion in Korea. It sought to rejuvenate the country by revising Confucian practices, introducing democracy, establishing human rights, and eliminating foreign interference. Within a year, Kim became a well-known figure amongst hundreds of people in the movement. During this time, he changed his name to Kim Ch&#x27;angsu (), following the East Asian practice of changing names after significant life events.

In early 1894, the peasant revolution began. 17-year-old Kim was appointed a district leader of P&#x27;albong () and given a Donghak army regiment of around 700. Around September or November, by order of Donghak leader Ch&#x27;oi Sihyŏng (), Kim&#x27;s troops stormed the Haeju fort in Hwanghae province, but the unit was eventually defeated by government and Japanese forces.

A power struggle then occurred, in which Yi Tongyŏp (), a fellow rebel, wished to take control of Kim&#x27;s unit. In December of that year, Yi&#x27;s unit attacked Kim&#x27;s and won. Kim managed to escape to the mountainous Monggeumpo. In the meantime, Yi captured and executed Kim&#x27;s close subordinate Yi Chongsŏn (). Eventually, Kim buried his comrade and decided to defect.

=== Defection and journey to Qing (1895–1896) ===

In 1895, Kim defected and joined Royal Army General An T&#x27;aehun (; 1862–1905). He spent three months in hiding, while recovering from measles and a high fever. An took such a liking to Kim, that he took Kim into his own home and procured a separate house for Kim&#x27;s parents. He scolded any officials that treated Kim poorly. During this time, Kim also became acquainted with An&#x27;s eldest son An Jung-geun. The younger An would later infamously assassinate the Japanese resident-general of Korea, Itō Hirobumi, and become a national hero in both modern Koreas.

An also introduced Kim to Ko Nŭngsŏn (), a well-known scholar in the region who followed an isolationist Neo-Confucian ideology called . They spoke every day for months. Robert S. Kim argues that this made a lasting impact on Kim&#x27;s thinking, even after Kim&#x27;s later conversion to Christianity. Ko convinced Kim that Joseon was in great danger from Japanese imperialism, and that he should go visit Qing China to convince them to help protect Joseon.

Thus, at age 20, Kim and a companion around eight to nine years his elder named Kim Hyŏngjin () decided to first make a pilgrimage to the legendary ancestral home of Koreans, Paektu Mountain, then through Manchuria, and finally to the Qing capital Beijing. However, near the foot of the mountain, they decided the journey would be too perilous, and instead decided to go directly to Tonghua in Manchuria.

On the way to Tonghua, near the Yalu River, which currently serves as the border between China and North Korea, the two men joined the righteous army commanded by Kim Iyŏn (), who was in the midst of attacking Kanggye fortress. However, the attack failed, and Kim escaped.

=== Killing of Tsuchida Josuke (1896) ===
In February 1896, upon hearing of China&#x27;s impending loss in the Sino–Japanese War, Kim decided to give up on his trip and return home. He tried to take a boat from Ch&#x27;ihap&#x27;o () in Hwanghae Province to Chinnamp&#x27;o (), but ice in the river made traveling dangerous, so he stayed in Ch&#x27;ihap&#x27;o at an inn.

There, Kim met a man also on his way to Chinnamp&#x27;o that he found suspicious. Kim wrote the following of this occurrence in his later autobiography:

On March 9, 1896, around 3 am, Kim took the man by surprise and kicked him to the floor. A scuffle ensued, and Kim managed to take the man&#x27;s own sword and stab him. Afterwards, Kim announced to other people what he had done, and left a proclamation on a wall that read &quot;I killed this Japanese to avenge the death of our queen. Signed Kim Ch&#x27;angsu of T&#x27;otkol, Paegunbang, Haeju&quot;.

Kim inspected the man&#x27;s possessions, and claimed that they positively identified the man as a Japanese army first lieutenant. The exact events and the identity of the man are still debated. However, the general consensus is that the man was Tsuchida Josuke (), a Japanese trader from Tsushima Island, Nagasaki who arrived in Korea in December 1895.

Meanwhile, Im Hakkil (), a Korean interpreter, went to Pyongyang and reported the murder to Hirahara Atsumu () at the Japanese consulate. Hirahara arrived in Ch&#x27;ihap&#x27;o on March 15, and ordered Kim&#x27;s arrest.

=== First imprisonment (1896–1898) ===
Joseon authorities took a relaxed attitude towards Kim&#x27;s arrest, and thus he was arrested three months later, around late June 1896, in his home. He was first held at a jail in Haeju, where he endured torture and poor treatment from Japanese authorities present at the jail, and was then moved to Incheon.

In Incheon, the constable and superintendent of the prison asked Kim why he killed Tsuchida. Upon hearing his answer, they were sympathetic and treated him with respect. Influential Koreans at the time, including major merchants of Incheon, repeatedly petitioned Korean Justice Department officials to pardon him and collected money for his bail.

Through processes that he did not fully understand at the time, Kim narrowly avoided an execution. On September 12, 1896, the Japanese consular agent Hagiwara Shuichi () found Kim guilty of the crime of manslaughter, and recommended execution by beheading. On October 2, 1896, the superintendent, under pressure from the consulate, suggested by telegram to the Incheon court that Kim be executed promptly. The court responded by saying they should ask King Gojong&#x27;s permission. On October 22, 1896, the King read the motivation behind Kim&#x27;s actions, and did not approve the sentences of Kim and 10 others. Thus, Kim escaped death.

In prison, Kim read newly-published translations of history and science books from the West. He was deeply impressed by what he read, in spite of the isolationist beliefs he had acquired from his time in the Donghak movement and from Ko. He reportedly then abandoned the idea that Westerners were barbarians, and decided that embracing new ideas would revolutionize Korea.

He taught many of his fellow prisoners how to read and write. While he first did this in exchange for favors, he began doing it voluntarily. This helped his standing in the prison, as even guards would ask him for help reading and writing.

=== Escape and Buddhist monkhood (1898–1899) ===

On March 19, 1898, he and several fellow prisoners successfully broke out of prison. In response, the Japanese arrested Kim&#x27;s father and held him for a year. He then walked from Seoul through Suwon and Osan, through the southern half of Korea, on a journey of over .

In the fall, Kim eventually met a monk with the surname Lee, who guided him to Magoksa, a Jogye Buddhist temple in Chungcheong Province. As Lee held a high position at the temple, he offered to let Kim join as a monk and to cover Kim&#x27;s expenses.

Kim shaved his head and became a monk named Wŏnjong (). He was frequently criticized by the monks at the temple for making mistakes while performing chants and chores. As he did not necessarily believe in Buddhism or enjoy the lifestyle, he decided he wanted to leave.

In spring of 1899, Kim requested to go study at Geumgang Mountain. His request was approved by the head monk, who gave him rations of grain for his journey. Instead of going to the mountain, Kim slipped away from his fellow monks and reunited with his parents. By May, they made their way to Taebo mountain near Pyongyang.

=== Return home (1900–1905) ===
After his return to his home region, Kim visited Ko Nŭng-sŏn, who was disappointed to learn that Kim had embraced foreign ideas. Kim decided Ko&#x27;s ideas were outdated, and left him.

Kim returned home, around September or October, and his father died on December 9, 1900.

After his father&#x27;s death, Kim adopted the religion he had once opposed and was baptized as a Protestant Christian in February 1903. In December 1904, he married Ch&#x27;oe Chunrye () from Sinchon, Hwanghae Province. He was previously briefly engaged to two women, including Ch&#x27;oe Yŏok (), who died from illness in 1903, and An Sinho, whom he broke the engagement off with in 1903. He and Ch&#x27;oe Chunrye had a daughter together in 1906, but the daughter died within a year.

He worked as a farmer and started and became principal of several schools. He himself taught various subjects and at various levels, including middle school math. He moved several times for his work during this period.

== Independence activities in Korea (1905–1919) ==
In November 1905, the short-lived Korean Empire became a protectorate of Japan, after it was compelled to sign the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905 (also known as the &quot;Eulsa Treaty&quot;). The treaty was the result of Japanese victory in the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, the 1905 Taft-Katsura agreement between Japan and the United States, and the 1894–1895 First Sino–Japanese War. The combination of these factors effectively cemented Japan&#x27;s status as the main great power in the region. In a few years, in 1910, Korea would be formally annexed into the Japanese Empire.

Shortly after the November 1905 treaty, Kim went to Seoul to participate in protests against the treaty. He and other future leaders of the Korean independence movement such as Yi Dong-nyeong and Yi Tjoune gave speeches at the palace gates Daehanmun of the royal palace Deoksugung. They urged Emperor Gwangmu (formerly &quot;King Gojong&quot;) to withdraw from the treaty. However, these protests were dispersed by the Korean authorities. Disheartened, Kim decided that Korea would continue to be stuck in a weak position until its people became smarter and more patriotic. He resolved to commit himself more fully to his educational activities. He returned home and continued teaching.

In 1907, Kim joined the New People&#x27;s Association. He then became the leader of its Hwanghae branch. The organization was founded in 1906 by Ahn Changho in Los Angeles, California, and was dedicated to the independence of Korea.

In 1909, after An Jung-geun assassinated Itō Hirobumi, Kim was arrested and jailed for around a month amongst a wave of arrests in the independence movement. He was eventually released after no evidence linking him to the murder was found.

=== Third imprisonment (1911–1915) ===
In January 1911, over 700 Koreans were arrested by the Japanese colonial government on charges of planning to assassinate Terauchi Masatake, the Governor-General of Chōsen. Kim was arrested via his connection to , the cousin of An Jung-geun. In total, 105 people were sentenced, leading this incident to be known as the &quot;105-Man Incident&quot;. Kim received a sentence of 15 years.

He spent two years and six months in Seodaemun Prison, which is now a museum. There, he was tortured and beaten. Kim&#x27;s left ear became permanently disfigured, and he attempted suicide but failed. His calves were already scarred from his earlier imprisonment after the killing of Tsuchida. Fellow prisoner Han P&#x27;ilho () was killed, and Sin Sŏkch&#x27;ung () committed suicide. An tried to commit suicide during the interrogation process but failed.

In 1912, while imprisoned, Kim changed his name to his most famous one: &quot;Kim Ku&quot;. This name, which literally means &quot;nine&quot;, was deliberately plain, in contrast to the often intricate names chosen by others. His also-famous art name, &quot;Paekpŏm&quot;, follows a similar theme. It literally means &quot;ordinary person&quot;. Together, these names reflected Kim&#x27;s belief that even the most ordinary person could and needed to fight for Korean independence.
After his time in Seodaemun, he was transferred to an Incheon prison. As prisoner number 55, Kim was reunited with his former cellmate from 17 years ago, Mun Chongch&#x27;il ().

=== Release from prison (1915–1919) ===
Kim did not end up serving his full sentence in prison. Emperor Meiji died in July 1912, and Empress Shoken in April 1914, which led to successive pardons issued by the Japanese government. His sentence was first reduced to seven years, then a third of his remaining sentence was commuted. He spent the remaining two years of his sentence doing hard labor.

In July or August 1915, 39-year-old Kim was released on parole. He wanted to resume teaching, but his status as a political prisoner prevented him from doing so. Instead, he engaged in farming.

== Exile in Shanghai (1919–1932) ==

On March 1, 1919, Kim participated in a nationwide non-violent protest now known as the March First Movement that was violently suppressed by Imperial Japan, resulting in thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of arrests. Kim and many other Korean nationalists soon left the country to escape from Japanese authorities. This movement is widely considered a catalyst for the Korean independence movement, and is now remembered as a national holiday in South Korea.

=== Early Provisional Government (1919–1926) ===

On March 29, 1919, Kim began a train journey to Shanghai, China in order to join the Korean Provisional Government (KPG). He arrived on April 13, and was appointed police commissioner. He would spend the next 13 years hiding in Shanghai, never leaving the city the entire time. In September 1919, the first president of the KPG, Syngman Rhee, was elected, and Kim made the Chief of Staff.

The KPG was highly unstable for much of its history. It constantly dodged Japanese intelligence agents and Korean spies who betrayed them for various reasons. Kim executed a number of traitors and collaborators during his time as commissioner. In order to avoid detection by the Japanese authorities, the government moved often, renting buildings from sympathetic people in the French concession, the British concession, and from the Kuomintang. Numerous positions were created then dissolved within a few years. Kim and many others often served in one or more positions for just a few months until moving onto a new one. For example, in April 1924, Kim moved on from his position of acting Prime Minister to concurrently serving as Minister of Internal Affairs and as Minister of Labor.

The KPG and its members also consistently dealt with funding issues. They acquired most of their funding from the Korean American community, which numbered around 7,000 and dealt with its own funding issues. The KPG struggled to pay rent and salaries, which proved to be a source of constant friction and fracturing inside of the group. On August 29, 1925, Na Seok-ju sold his clothes in order to buy a birthday gift for Kim&#x27;s 49th birthday. Kim remembered that he himself was unable to afford celebrating his mother&#x27;s 60th birthday (in Korean age) in 1919, and was so ashamed that he decided to no longer celebrate his own birthday.

The KPG also suffered from a political divide between its left and right leaning members. In 1923, a faction of communists funded by the Soviet Union attempted to split off their own government, but failed to do so due to their own infighting. Kim was aligned with the KPG&#x27;s other main faction, the pro-American Christians.

Kim&#x27;s family life was difficult during this period. On January 1, 1924, just two years after the birth of his fifth child, Shin, his wife died. Because Kim was a wanted man, he was unable to visit her in the hospital before she died. According to a 2012 interview with Shin, Kim then temporarily placed Shin in an orphanage, as he could not take care of him while working. In November 1925, his mother and Shin returned to Korea to avoid interfering in Kim&#x27;s work. Eventually, in September 1927, his eldest son In would also return to Korea.

=== First term as president and government instability (1926–1930) ===
The group also suffered from internal conflict. In March 1925, Syngman Rhee was impeached over allegations that he abused his power. From then until December 1926, leadership changed rapidly, as seven heads of state served and resigned. Most only served a few months, with Ahn Changho serving fewer than two weeks due to being unable to form a cabinet. Rhee left to the United States shortly after his impeachment. In 1928, Kim sent letters to him, asking for donations to the KPG, which Rhee refused on the grounds that he too was suffering from financial difficulties. Despite the KPG&#x27;s support from sympathetic foreigners, they were largely ignored by the governments of the United States and China. However, the KPG eventually managed to secure support from the Chinese government after Kim organized the Korean Patriotic Organization in 1931. 
From December 14, 1926, to August 18, 1927, Kim Ku served as head of government. In late March 1927, shortly after beginning his term, he reorganized the office of president () into &quot;Chairman of the State Council Directory&quot; (), where the chairman is the first among equals in a state council. Robert S. Kim attributes this to why Kim&#x27;s term as head lasted longer than that of others; Kim served around eight months before leaving office. He became the Minister of Internal Affairs again after leaving office, and Yi Tongnyŏng became the head of government. Yi served for two three-year terms, until 1933; the first president since 1925 to serve for longer than a year.

In May 1929, he completed the first volume of the &quot;Diary of Kim Ku&quot; (), when he was around 53 years old. Around this time, he made and gifted unique copies of the volume as thanks to several donors, including organizations of the Korean-American community and Ho Chong. In 1930, Kim established and became the head of the Korea Independence Party, in an effort to unite the right-leaning members of the government. The party would last until 1970, albeit as a minor party after his death in 1949.

=== Korean Patriotic Organization (1931–1932) ===

In 1931, Kim became the founding leader of the Korean Patriotic Organization (KPO), which was dedicated to the assassination of important Japanese imperial and colonial personnel. The organization was created in response to recent events and the perceived stagnation of the independence movement. The KPG also wanted to improve the relationship between China and Korea, due to heightened tensions between the two after the 1931 Wanpaoshan Incident. The KPO&#x27;s cause was seen as so urgent that it received around half of the budget of the KPG.

==== Sakuradamon incident ====

On January 8, 1932, KPO member Lee Bong-chang attempted an assassination of Emperor Hirohito in Tokyo, in what became known as the Sakuradamon incident. Lee threw a grenade that missed the Emperor&#x27;s carriage. He was later executed on October 10.

==== Hongkou Park Incident ====
On April 29, member Yun Bong-gil detonated a bomb that killed and wounded several Japanese military and colonial leadership in Shanghai&#x27;s Hongkou Park. Among the dead was Commander in Chief of the Shanghai Expeditionary Army General Yoshinori Shirakawa. After a botched suicide attempt at the scene of the crime, Yun was captured and later executed on December 19.

== Infamy and escape (1932–1937) ==
After the Shanghai bombing in late April, Kim became infamous. In order to avoid putting other Koreans at risk, Kim sent statements to various newspapers in Shanghai in which he claimed personal responsibility for organizing the KPO&#x27;s activities. Various Japanese government bodies put bounties on him worth a combined 60,000 Dayang (), an enormous sum for that time.

With this, Kim began a flight across China that would last until 1939 and rival the length of the famous Long March. First, the American Presbyterian missionary George Ashmore Fitch, a friend of Kim&#x27;s and many others in the Korean independence movement, hid Kim and several others at his house in Shanghai. Fitch wrote in his 1967 autobiography of this event:

When the Japanese came close to finding him, Kim escaped by pretending to be an American couple with Fitch&#x27;s wife.

=== Jiaxing, Haiyan, and &#x27;marriage&#x27; (1932) ===

A Chinese sympathizer named helped Kim and others escape to a hiding place at 76 Meiwan Street () in Jiaxing. The building had numerous features to facilitate hiding, including false closets, hidden doors, and a boat docked underneath the house. It still exists to this day, with a memorial at the spot. He borrowed his grandmother&#x27;s maiden name and assumed a false identity as a Cantonese man.

Meanwhile, the other members of the KPG left Shanghai in May 1932, and moved their headquarters to Hangzhou. They remained there until November 1935. Around June 1932, Kim resigned from the KPG in acknowledgement of the fact that he would not be able to adequately perform his duties while on the run.

In the summer, after witnessing Japanese authorities at Jiaxing station questioning locals on Kim&#x27;s whereabouts, Chu moved Kim to his daughter-in-law Zhu Jiarui&#x27;s () house at Zaiqing Villa () in Haiyan county. Here too now stands a memorial of Kim&#x27;s time there.
In order to make up for Kim&#x27;s poor Chinese-speaking skills, Zhu proposed that he marry a local Chinese woman. She suggested he marry one of her friends, a middle school teacher. However, Kim thought a teacher would be too intelligent and might figure him out, and instead proposed marrying the 20-year-old owner of the boat he often rode, named Zhu Aibao (; ). They had a 37-year age gap. While they never officially married, they were functionally husband and wife, and began to live together on her boat.

Ironically, being on the run in Haiyan was one of the most peaceful times of his life after his exile. Although he still participated in independence-related activities, he enjoyed the time outside of work. When he lived in Shanghai, he had rarely spent time outdoors. Here, he embarked on regular hiking trips and spent time with Zhu. He even came to view her as his actual spouse. In his autobiography, he wrote that he felt bad about deceiving her and not being of much financial help. They had a relationship for around five years total. It remains unclear whether Zhu ever knew about Kim&#x27;s true identity. After November 1937, he never saw her again. Later, Kim&#x27;s descendants attempted to locate Zhu Aibao or her descendants, but were unable to.

=== Three assassinations and an attempted fourth (1933) ===
In the second half of 1933, three successful assassinations and an attempted fourth occurred in Shanghai that were all connected to Kim. The targets were all pro-Japanese Koreans. Ok Kwanbin was assassinated at the behest of Kim on August 1, a pro-Japanese police officer investigating Kim was killed on August 17, the head of the Shanghai Korean Friends Association () survived an assassination attempt on August 31, and Ok&#x27;s cousin was assassinated on August 18.

=== Beginning of support from the Kuomintang (1933–1937) ===

Around July 1932, Kim requested a meeting with Chiang Kai-shek, with the intent to ask for help in establishing a cavalry training school for the numerous Koreans in Manchuria. Chiang agreed to meet Kim, but was skeptical of the viability of the cavalry school.

Around September 1932, they met at the Whampoa Military Academy in Nanjing. According to Kim&#x27;s autobiography, after exchanging verbal pleasantries, Kim picked up a brush and wrote in Chinese:

The next day, Chiang responded with a counterclaim that terrorism and assassinations had their limits, since Japan could always replace personnel. After some negotiations, they compromised; Chiang agreed to pay Kim 5,000 yuan per month, offered to hide him from the Japanese, and allow him to train Korean resistance fighters in the Luoyang branch of the Republic of China Military Academy. In addition, 40 horses were to be provided in order to train a cavalry unit. Although somewhat disappointed by the lack of a Manchurian school, Kim was elated to have a stable source of revenue. He then spent much effort in trying to recruit young Korean fighters.

=== Beginning to train independence fighters (1934–1935) ===

In February 1934, Kim became one of the administrators of the 17th Army Officer Training Class of the 4th Battalion (), around 30 km north of Luoyang. The KPG class was named and presented as if it were yet another all-Chinese class (the previous 16 classes had graduated only Chinese students), in order to avoid detection from the Japanese. Training covered topics such as tactics, weapons, politics, communication, physical education, riding, and shooting. They trained with great urgency, as there was a prevailing sense that a second Sino–Japanese conflict and/or World War would begin within one to two years.

There were 92 students in total. Kim had made a special point of recruiting the armed forces of the 1930 Korea Independence Party (different from Kim&#x27;s party and later army; ). These fighters had sided with Chinese forces during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Also in attendance were 20 students of the Chosŏn Revolutionary Military and Political Officers School () in Nanjing. Kim had not been the first to receive funding and military training support from the Kuomintang. Kim Won-bong, former leader of the Shanghai-based Heroic Corps, had been training students in Nanjing since October 1932.The training had several difficulties. One of the most notable issues was infighting. The leftist beliefs of Kim Won-bong and his followers clashed with the KPG&#x27;s general rightist tendencies. The two Kims would later become rivals. Even amongst the right-leaning students, two factions emerged. One supported Chi Ch&#x27;ŏngch&#x27;ŏn, and the other Kim. In addition, one of the students, Yeom Dong-jin, went on to develop an intense dislike of Kim Ku and become a key part of ongoing conspiracy theories surrounding Kim&#x27;s eventual 1949 assassination.

Around June, Kim&#x27;s funding from the Kuomintang was cut in half. In addition, Japanese authorities began to zero in on their Luoyang training location, and so they had to temporarily relocate to a temple. Around August, 25 students, including Kim&#x27;s son In, were expelled by order of Kim and either placed on special missions or into regular Kuomintang military classes. Around September, four trainees were caught and arrested by Japanese authorities in Nanjing. By October, training activities greatly slowed. In December 1934, he created a special forces division () for the remaining trainees, which came to be known as the &quot;Kim Ku Club&quot; ().

On April 9, 1935, the school stopped after only operating for about a year. Of the original 92 students, 62 graduated. The school was closed for a variety of reasons, including internal conflicts between left- and right-leaning members and January 21, 1935, negotiations between the Kuomintang and Japanese governments.
After courses began, he invited his mother and sons to return to China. His stable income, protection from the Kuomintang, and the advanced age of his mother (75) motivated this decision. With assistance from independence fighters such as Kim Sŏn-ryang (), they secretly took a boat from Pyongyang to Dalian, another to Shanghai, and finally a train to Jiaxing. In early April 1934, Kim reunited with his mother and two sons in Jiaxing for the first time in nine years. They went together to Nanjing, where Kim had prepared a house for them.

=== Infighting in the Provisional Government (1933–1935) ===
As a result of the bombing, the assassinations, the flight of KPG members from Shanghai, and the increasingly intense searching of the Japanese, the independence movement was thrown into chaos. Much of the KPG stopped functioning, and internal infighting amongst those who stayed in Shanghai intensified.

In January 1933, Kim&#x27;s Independence Party voted to remove all of the absent leadership, except for Kim. Despite the fact that Kim had resigned from the KPG in the previous year, they kept him on out of respect. Regardless, he functionally did not play much of a role in the party between his escape and 1934.

The KPG moved its headquarters several times during this period. On October 3, 1933, the Provisional Assembly held its first meeting in a year at Hangzhou, delayed due to the chaos and the vacant chairman position. Four people attended. On January 2, 1934, they held another meeting in Zhenjiang. This time, they elected all new members, but Kim was not a candidate. Thus, after almost 15 years of serving in the assembly, Kim lost his seat.

In mid-1935, a significant split in the KPG emerged while Kim was busy with training students. A majority of the KPG, including Kim Won-bong, Jo So-ang and Kim Tu-bong, began advocating for the dissolution of the KPG and all parties, in favor of creating a single-party government. This came to pass in July, as several parties, including a breakaway group of Kim&#x27;s party, unified into the Korean National Revolutionary Party (KNRP) under Kim Won-bong&#x27;s leadership. Kim Ku opposed the dissolution of the KPG and saw one-party rule as infeasible, as internal tensions were only growing and not shrinking. He openly criticized the KNRP in multiple public letters. After two years of absence, he rejoined the KPG and united what remained of it into the Korean National Party (KNP; ) around November. The more right-leaning KNP aligned itself with the United States and the left-leaning KNRP more with the Soviet Union. Even graduates of Kim&#x27;s military school ended up divided along factional lines, and joined various organizations afterwards. The two parties competed fiercely for the support of the broader Korean community and the Kuomintang, publishing public letters and newspapers to advocate their positions.

== Second Sino–Japanese War (1937–1945) ==

In early July 1937, the anticipated China–Japan conflict began in earnest. On July 15, the KPG met to plan their involvement in the conflict. They saw it as a critical opportunity to achieve independence. On August 9, the KPG approved a plan to set up a training camp and train an army that included 200 junior officers. Their planned budget for 1938 was 226 times larger than their 1937 budget, with military expenditures accounting for 98% of it. They expected to receive most of their funding from the Kuomintang, and the remaining approximately one-fifth via donations from the international Korean community. However, these efforts were a failure, as none of their plans came to fruition due to their following the retreat of the Kuomintang across China.

=== Flight from Nanjing to Changsha (1937–1938) ===

On August 17, 1937, the various parties of the KPG finally united into a coalition. The Japanese began air raids on Nanjing, which Kim experienced on August 26. Around this time, he stayed in a small town near Nanjing in order to avoid being captured by Japanese agents, who expected him to be in the city. In early November, Japanese troops began approaching Nanjing. The Kuomintang began moving to Chongqing on November 16, and the KPG to Changsha on November 18. They chose Changsha because of its lower cost of living and its proximity to Hong Kong, through which they could contact the outside world. They also decided if the war got even worse, they could relocate from there to Hawaii.

Kim set about coordinating and funding the evacuation of around 120 people, including KPG personnel and their families. Kim planned to retrieve An Jung-geun&#x27;s widow from Shanghai by sending one of An&#x27;s brothers after her, but the brother returned with only his own family. Kim continually worried about her safety for the rest of the KPG&#x27;s escape. He also lamented only being able to provide just 100 yuan for Zhu Aibao, his &#x27;wife&#x27;, to return to Jiaxing. They never saw each other again. Kim then took his younger son and mother on a British steam ship to Hankou, then another boat to Changsha. Just three weeks after their departure, the Japanese perpetrated the infamous Nanjing Massacre.

By December 20, the KPG completed moving its personnel to Changsha. Finances became tighter, as receiving aid from the Kuomintang or expatriate community became more difficult, and because the other income streams of KPG members were severed. However, they adjusted by housing multiple families together. In spite of these difficulties, their time in Changsha was initially relatively calm. As they were temporarily safe from Japanese agents, Kim openly used his name for the first time since his arrival to China almost two decades earlier. Around this time, his mother celebrated her 80th birthday (Korean age). He wanted to throw her a party, but she refused it. Instead, she demanded that Kim use the money, that would have otherwise been spent on her, to purchase a pistol for Korean fighters. He obeyed her request.

==== Shot in Changsha (1938) ====
Relationships between various parties improved drastically after their move to Changsha, and many found common ground. On May 5, Kim proposed a dinner for the cadres of several parties, around 10 people total.

On May 7, they held the dinner on the second floor of a building in Changsha. Spirits were high, and the group exchanged jokes. Around 6:20 pm, a young man burst in and fired four shots from his pistol. Youths downstairs began rushing up to apprehend the culprit, but he escaped by jumping from the second floor. The first bullet hit Kim, the second Hyŏn Ikch&#x27;ŏl, the third Ryu Tongnyŏl (), and the fourth Chi Ch&#x27;ŏngch&#x27;ŏn. Of the four people shot, all recovered, except Hyŏn, who died that day and was later buried on Yuelu Mountain.

Kim was shot in the left chest and lost consciousness. He was taken to the Xiangya Hospital (), but the doctor refused to accept him, saying there was no hope for treatment. Telegrams about the shooting were urgently sent to others in the independence movement, which caused some people to immediately disembark to Changsha, with the expectation that they&#x27;d be attending a funeral. But Kim continued breathing, and after three hours a doctor finally relented to seeing him. Kim survived the shooting.

The culprit was 30-year-old Yi Unhwan (). He was known for being brash and uncompromising, and had even been expelled from the KNRP just two months earlier after rumors circulated that he wanted to assassinate various party leaders. His stated motivation was that he was dissatisfied with the direction the KNRP was taking. Six days later, he was arrested by Chinese police at a rural train station dozens of kilometers away and sentenced to death. But he escaped from his imprisonment and was never recaptured.

When Chiang Kai-shek heard of the incident, he sent a telegram to Kim&#x27;s hospital and requested they take good care of him. When Kim came to, he had no memory of what had happened. The doctor told him his injury was the result of him drunkenly falling on a table, which Kim believed. It was only until his release a month later that he learned the truth. The bullet remained in his chest for the rest of his life and affected his movement. After his release, he told his mother what had happened. She reportedly calmly replied, &quot;You know God is protecting you. Evil cannot hurt the just (&quot;邪不犯正&quot;). But what&#x27;s regrettable is that [the shooter] was Korean; being shot by a Korean and living is worse than being shot by a Japanese (&quot;일인&quot;) and dying&quot;.

=== Arrival in Chongqing (1938–1940) ===
After Kim&#x27;s release from the hospital, he spent the rest of the year managing the relocation of around 400 KPG members and family. Changsha became unsafe, as Japanese air raids intensified and refugees poured in. The KPG initially moved to Guangzhou, but after a few months, the Japanese began to encroach yet again. They finally decided to move to Chongqing to be with the Kuomintang leadership, abandoning their plan of staying near Hong Kong. Throughout this time, they were under constant threat of the Japanese, and narrowly escaped capture several times. On October 26, Kim arrived in Chongqing, ahead of much of the KPG and their family. There, he coordinated travel, sent requests for funding abroad, and coordinated with the Kuomintang and local Chinese governments.

In early 1939, Kim learned that his mother had contracted pharyngitis while traveling, and that her health was deteriorating. He rushed to her bedside in Chongqing, but she could not be saved. Feeling her end was near, Kwak Nak-wŏn gave her final wish to her son: &quot;Hurry and succeed in your independence work. After you do, take the ashes of myself and In&#x27;s mother and bury them in our homeland&quot;. She died at 10:50 am on April 26, 1939. She is currently buried in the Daejeon National Cemetery in South Korea, along with In.

Their time in Chongqing was to be difficult. Kim described his time here as his &quot;Dying Period&quot; (). The population of Chongqing was below 500,000 before the war, but after the Kuomintang and other refugees moved there, it surged to over 1,000,000. Housing was constantly in short supply, and regular Japanese bombing runs made the situation even worse. Kim frequently had to allocate money from their already-stretched budget for constructing or maintaining housing for KPG members and their families. From 1938 to 1945, around 70 to 80 Koreans died of pneumonia due to poor air quality, high humidity, and poor access to healthcare. Among them was Kim&#x27;s eldest son In, who would die in 1945. Kim himself suffered from thiamine deficiency during this period, and spent many days hiding in bomb shelters and seeing trucks overflowing with dead bodies. Despite all this, the KPG actually lived relatively comfortably compared to much of the Chinese population of Chongqing, as the majority of Chinese families had even less reliable access to food and shelter.

They moved office buildings four times, after each building was destroyed by Japanese bombings. Their second office building was so severely destroyed on September 2, 1940, that not even a single article of clothing could be salvaged from it. Their third office was damp, dark, and had no plumbing, so they placed a bucket in a corner to urinate in. They would use this office for four years (until January 1945), the longest they used a building since Shanghai. While there, around March 1942, Kim would finish the second volume of his autobiography, the &quot;Diary of Kim Ku&quot;.

==== Failure to unite the independence movement (1939–1940) ====
After his arrival in Chongqing, Kim began work on integrating the various parties. Despite arguing against integration four years ago, the war had changed his mind. Another significant motivation for this was to appease the Kuomintang leadership, who were disappointed in the movement&#x27;s continued infighting, epitomized in the Changsha shooting incident. The Kuomintang had even mediated several integration talks in 1937, which failed.

In particular, Kim sought to unify with Kim Won-bong. Unlike Kim Ku and the KPG, Kim Won-bong and the KNRP had actually succeeded in raising an army. On October 10, 1938, Kim Won-bong had created and became commander-in-chief of the first Korean armed forces in China, the Korean Volunteers Army (). The army, with the help of Japanese Communist Kazuo Aoyama, managed to raise 100 soldiers and funding from the Kuomintang. By February 1940, they would have 314 soldiers.

In early 1939, they began negotiating their merger in earnest, but sides had somewhat flipped since 1935; Kim proposed a single party, while the left-leaning groups wanted a multi-party government. After several meetings, on May 10, the two Kims released a joint statement () advocating for a one-party government and listing ten shared ideals for the liberated Korea. The shared ideals included topics such as gender equality, ending feudalism, land redistribution, and creating free compulsory education. On August 27, their parties participated in the Korean Revolution Movement Unification Seven Group Meeting () in the Qijiang District of Chongqing, although the two Kims did not personally attend. Two of the seven parties withdrew from the conference after refusing to unite. The remaining five agreed to unite in principle, but talks broke down over the specifics of the merger. They disagreed on who would command the armed forces and to what extent they should collaborate with the right-leaning Kuomintang. Shortly after the breakdown of the talks, Germany invaded Poland, and World War II began.

After talks broke down, the Kuomintang representative at the meeting evaluated the two Kims as follows:

Kim placed the blame of the collapse in negotiations on the left-leaning parties, an assessment that the right-leaning Kuomintang generally agreed with. In a later January 1940 letter, he predicted that if right and left failed to find common ground now, the Korean peninsula would be &quot;stained red with blood&quot; in the future. The Kuomintang was continually frustrated with the lack of progress. They decided on January 19, 1940 to take a more active role in mediating unification talks, and pushing for unification even if it meant excluding some left-leaning parties. In the meantime, on April 2, the Kuomintang met with the various Korean parties. There, they firmly proposed that the left and right leaning groups coexist, but operate in different territories. The KPG would operate between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, and the KNRP south of the Yangtze. The proposal was accepted.

On March 13, 1940, the sitting KPG President Yi Tongnyŏng died of pneumonia. Lee died at age 70, and had served around 12 years total as the head of government. Kim became head of government after Lee&#x27;s death. Kim was crushed, and read an emotional eulogy at Lee&#x27;s funeral on March 17. On April 1, the parties within the KPG unified into the Korean Independence Party, and on May 11, Kim was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee.

=== Creating the Korean Liberation Army (1939–1942) ===

On November 11, 1939, the KPG announced a plan, created by Jo So-ang, to create an army. The plan called for 110,000 party members, 1,200 officers, 100,000 soldiers, and 350,000 guerrillas raised after four years, totaling 541,200 personnel across six countries. It had an astronomical price-tag of 70.18 million yuan. By contrast, the total budget of the KPG in 1939 was 29,123 yuan. The South Korean historian Son Se-il described the plan as &quot;wildly removed from reality&quot;, and called Jo and the State Council that approved the plan &quot;hopeless utopians&quot;. Once Kim took the reins of creating the army, he took a more realist approach.

On April 11, 1940, Chiang approved Kim&#x27;s proposal for creating a KPG army, albeit with funding granted only depending on immediate needs. However, a disagreement between the Kuomintang and Kim arose, as Chiang wanted the army to be subordinate to the Kuomintang army, and Kim wanted greater independence in order to establish the army&#x27;s credibility and legitimacy. The Kuomintang pulled out of the deal, refusing to provide funding. Kim moved forward anyway with creating the army.

On September 17, 1940, the formal establishment of the Korean Liberation Army (KLA) was announced. General Chi Ch&#x27;ŏngch&#x27;ŏn was to be its commander. They held a ceremony at then-luxurious Jialing Hotel (), in order to establish the army&#x27;s credibility and reputation. It was held early in the morning, at 6 am, as to avoid Japanese air raids. Over 200 people were in attendance, including foreign ambassadors and Kuomintang officials.

The KLA became a rallying point for the Korean-American community, and donations came in greater volume. The San Francisco-based &quot;Sinhan Minbo&quot; newspaper regularly and prominently reported on the KLA&#x27;s activities. Kim and many others in the KLA were adamantly convinced that around 30 million Koreans on the peninsula would eventually rise up against the Japanese and support the KLA&#x27;s cause.

In September 1940, Kim was handily reelected as head of government, and he would hold this post until his return to Korea in 1945. On October 8, the KPG modified its constitution, with particular intent to reorganize the chief executive to have greater power in order to account for management of a standing army. Thus, Kim became the Chairperson of the State Affairs Commission (). This position was no longer considered first among equals, and instead entailed being commander-in-chief of the army, having veto power, and being able to issue executive orders. On November 12, the KLA announced their intent to switch from guerrilla warfare to conventional battle. They also moved their headquarters to Xi&#x27;an around this time. They began carrying out covert operations, recruiting youths, and publishing Chinese and Korean language newsletters. By January 1, 1941, they created five divisions, with over 100 people in the fifth division alone.

==== Difficulty gaining Kuomintang and US support ====
The Kuomintang put off formally recognizing the KLA for months and providing support for even longer, to Kim&#x27;s dismay. The KLA had been growing rapidly, as hundreds of Koreans from all over China flocked to join, but the soldiers sat idle and underfunded. In February 1941, the Kuomintang even ordered its armed forces to block or restrict KLA activities. However, they began easing up around March, and by May 28, 1941, formally recognized the KLA. But aid was still slow to come. One reason for this delay was Kim Won-bong&#x27;s interference, as he viewed the KLA as competition, especially because the Volunteers Army was subordinate to the Kuomintang and because the Kuomintang and KLA were more politically aligned. Another reason was concern about international pushback, particularly from the United States and the Soviet Union, by approving the KLA.

The US government hesitated on approving not just the KLA, but also the KPG. Kim sent multiple letters to President Franklin D. Roosevelt asking for the establishment of formal KPG–US ties, including one sent via President Roosevelt&#x27;s son, James Roosevelt, who visited Chongqing in July. But these were all ignored. Especially after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, many in the US government were actually open to supporting Korean independence, but were cautious because of how it could impact the Pacific War, how it could cause other independence movements to demand US support, and because of the internal political division amongst Koreans. Around December 1941, the KPG declared war on Japan.

The US rejected proposals to recognize the KPG on multiple occasions. In April 1942, in a presentation to President Roosevelt, Chinese foreign minister T. V. Soong outlined their plan to merge the KLA and various militant Korean groups into an irregular army of around 50,000 men. These men would conduct guerrilla operations and eventually enter the Korean peninsula. Afterwards, as part of the plan, the US would eventually recognise the KPG as the rightful Korean government. However, in early May, the US responded by saying it was favorable towards the irregular army but rejected sole recognition of the KPG. As a result, the Kuomintang abandoned efforts to persuade other governments to recognize the KPG.

In mid-1942, the Allies began secretly discussing placing Korea into a trusteeship after the conclusion of the war. Rumors of this eventually began circulating amongst the Korean independence movement, resulting in anger and disappointment. On November 27, 1943, the US, UK and China announced the 1943 Cairo Declaration, in which Korea &quot;in due course&quot; would &quot;become free and independent&quot;. While there was initial excitement, they realized &quot;in due course&quot; could imply trusteeship, which infuriated Kim and many others. On December 9, 1943, Kim told an Associated Press reporter:

=== Kuomintang intervention, military and political unification (1942) ===
In May 1941, Kim Won-bong&#x27;s KNRP began joining the KPG, albeit to much conflict. Later attempts for KNRP members to get elected into the National Council were highly controversial, and resulted in fist fights and nullified elections.

In early 1942, Kim became aware that the Kuomintang had been privately negotiating with Kim Won-bong to absorb the two dozen officers of the Korean Volunteers Army in Chongqing into the KLA. Kim Won-bong relented to this, on the condition that he become the deputy commander (), a position that did not yet exist in the KLA.

On May 13, the KPG relented and approved the merger. Thus, the Korean Volunteers Army became absorbed into the KLA. This decision displeased both sides. Kim Ku protested to the Kuomintang in multiple letters, insisting they avoid directly interfering in the KLA&#x27;s affairs. Kim Won-bong reportedly cried and drank all night on May 15, and delayed taking up his position until December 5. In an effort to gain greater control over the KLA, the Kuomintang quickly began reducing funding and placing numerous Chinese officers in vacant KLA administration positions. This effectively made any significant military activities impossible.

On October 9, Chiang effectively softened his stance by laying out a plan to handle the Korean independence movement, in which they would initially provide one million yuan of funding to the KPG, provide relative autonomy for the various Korean parties, and assure Korea that China would consider its independence first before any other country. Shortly afterwards, on October 11, the Kuomintang finally managed to unify the various parties by itself joining a coalition called the China–Korea Cultural Association (). The KNRP had a relatively weak showing in KPG elections. Kim and others in the Independence Party were elated at these developments, as it somewhat met their original goals and also signaled their victory over the KNRP.

=== Infighting and reconciliation (1943–1945) ===
==== Alleged assassination attempt and funding conflict ====
On May 15, the Independence Party announced that there had been an assassination attempt on Kim and Independence Party leadership. They alleged that Kim T&#x27;ak (; Chinese name ) and Kim Sŭnggon (; ) bribed Pak Subok () to help them steal a handgun from KPG security guards in order to kill Independence Party leadership and increase KNRP power. They also alleged other KNRP leadership were involved.

Kim Sŭnggon and Park Subok were arrested by KPG security. The former escaped and alleged that he was tortured into giving a false confession. On the morning of June 10, KPG security stormed into KNRP offices to arrest Kim Tak, but he had already been evacuated. On June 21, the Chongqing Police took custody of Kim Sŭnggon and Pak Subok, but eventually released them due to a lack of evidence.

This incident damaged the KPG&#x27;s reputation in Chongqing and increased internal tensions. The KNRP insisted it was a false flag operation. Shortly afterwards, the KNRP announced it suspected Kim and the Independence Party were withholding funds from them, and published pamphlets all over Chongqing and abroad with their accusations. Kim was infuriated and deeply embarrassed by this.

==== Resignation from KPG, return, and compromise ====
After a failed in-person mediation attempt by Chiang on July 26, Kim and six others on the State Council resigned on August 31. As only four seats were filled, a quorum could not be reached, and KPG activities essentially froze. This development stunned the Korean American community and the Kuomintang. Son Se-il claimed that this act posed a tangible physical danger to Koreans in Chongqing, as the KPG managed security and housing efforts. On September 21, the seven withdrew their resignations and returned.

In early October, the 35th National Assembly meeting was one of the tensest in the KPG&#x27;s history. The main goal was to change the constitution to accommodate the inclusion of the KNRP. The KNRP also quickly submitted a motion to impeach Kim and the current government and concurrently managed to convince 17 members of the Independence Party to resign. Debates ran so fierce and long, that the conference was extended until April 1944. The Kuomintang intervened by threatening to withhold funds from both sides if a compromise was not reached.

Finally, on April 11, they compromised on the constitutional amendment and agreed to not impeach. Kim was reelected head of government and Kim Won-bong as head of the Armed Forces; both were sworn in on April 26. Kim Won-bong&#x27;s position was notably weakened, and he would continue to be excluded in other ways after this election.

==== Agreement with Kuomintang ====
On September 5, 1943, Kim met with Chiang and gave several requests, including public acknowledgement of the KPG as the representative government of Korea, greater independence of the KLA, and assistance for Koreans in Central Asia who had been deported in 1937. Other than independence for the KLA, much of the requests were either deferred or effectively denied by Chiang. Funding for the KLA remained so poor that it did not cover living expenses.

Many in the KPG decided they needed to expand their relationship with other Allied governments. In April 1943, the KLA decided to dispatch representatives to various Allied countries. Kim also continued sending letters advocating for Korea and offering KPG military support to President Roosevelt, including a congratulatory letter on June 17, 1944, after the successful Normandy landings. The KLA even sent soldiers to fight for the British Indian Army via the Kuomintang. On August 29, 1943, nine KLA personnel were sent to Calcutta. The Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Command Louis Mountbatten requested more troops, so the Kuomintang reluctantly arranged for 16 more KLA personnel to go, but this was delayed.Finally, on May 1, 1945, after a few months of negotiations, the KPG gained full control over the KLA under an agreement with the Kuomintang entitled &quot;Measures to Aid the Korean Liberation Army&quot; (). The agreement also specified that the Kuomintang would fund KLA operations by loaning funds. This effectively allowed the KLA to more freely collaborate with other Allied countries.

=== Eagle Project (1945) ===
In September 1944, Lee Beom-seok, then Chief of Staff of the KLA, began discussing a plan to send Korean guerrillas to the peninsula with various members of the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS). On February 24, the OSS completed a plan called the Eagle Project that was approved by US military headquarters on March 13. Kim&#x27;s first meeting with Sargent was supposed to be on April 1, but on March 29, Kim&#x27;s eldest son In died. Kim, Lee, and Sargent met on April 3, just north of Chongqing to discuss which operatives should be trained. Sargent&#x27;s aide described Kim as follows:


Training began in mid-May and proceeded relatively smoothly. The first class was set to graduate in early August. Kim decided to go there and meet General Donovan and the graduates of the first class in Xi&#x27;an, and took a US military plane there on August 5. They met when Donovan arrived on August 7. Spirits were high at the meeting; Donovan reportedly said &quot;Let both of our governments work closely together from now on&quot;, and Kim replied &quot;General, you took the words right out of my mouth&quot;.

Kim gave a telegram to Donovan that he wanted forwarded to President Harry S. Truman. On August 18, Donovan complied. A few weeks afterwards, Truman would send Donovan this response:

Kim later wrote that he was elated with how the meeting went, and that he was hopeful that the US would soon formally recognize the KPG. But around the time of the meeting, the US dropped the first atomic bombs on Japan, and less than a month later, Truman would dissolve the OSS.

== Return to Korea (1945–1949) ==

=== Departing China ===
On August 10, 1945, Kim learned of the surrender of Japan. He later described his feelings as such:
Kim, Lee, and the OSS began formulating a plan to have a division of the KLA return to the peninsula to perform reconnaissance and intelligence gathering tasks for the US. Despite the urging of the KPG and the Kuomintang for Kim to return to Chongqing, Kim decided to stay in Xi&#x27;an until the mission was fully planned, and returned to Chongqing on the 18th. However, authority was eventually taken away from the Eagle Project, which caused it to end by August 30. Meanwhile, Kim focused on wrapping up the KPG&#x27;s affairs in China while awaiting news from the Kuomintang and US.

In August 1945, Korea was haphazardly divided along the 38th parallel. By September 1945, the Soviet Union operated the Soviet Civil Administration in the north and the US the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) in the south. Meanwhile, the KPG continued to experience infighting. Politics in Korea were also fractured, with major factions in the USAMGIK including the right-leaning Korea Democratic Party (KDP), the left-leaning People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (PRK), and the Communist Party of Korea (CPK). The US chose Syngman Rhee as their preferred candidate for leadership in the occupied Korea. Rhee was allowed to return to Korea on October 16 and immediately began attempting to unify the various parties. Leveraging the nearly universal respect towards him, he was able to form a joint committee entitled (CCRRKI) with representatives from across the political spectrum. Rhee hoped that Kim and the KPG would support this group upon their return. After a number of farewell banquets, Kim and some other KPG members first went to Shanghai on November 5. They were originally supposed to go to Korea on November 10, but the US asked the KPG members to sign documents affirming that the KPG was not returning as the government of Korea and only as private citizens. After weeks of angry deliberation, they signed the documents on November 19.

=== Arrival in Korea ===
On November 23, Kim and 14 others quietly arrived at Gimpo Airport in Korea and were taken to the building Gyeonggyojang, which Kim was to use as a residence. When news broke of his arrival, his residence was swarmed with jubilant crowds and parades were held in his honor. Kim, Rhee, the KPG, and CCRRKI initially mostly cooperated. However, Kim and others refused to dissolve the provisional government, which disappointed the US and Rhee. By December, these relationships deteriorated. The left-leaning PRK and CPK had a split with the right-leaning groups in the CCRRKI; this led to the US outlawing the PRK on December 12, although the PRK continued to operate in spite of this. In addition, while Rhee had initially shown interest in working with the left-wing groups, he began to harshly condemn them, which alienated him even from parts of the KPG.

==== Anti-trusteeship movement ====
From December 16 to 26, 1945, the Moscow Conference was held, wherein the fate of Korea was a major topic. On December 28, it was announced that Korea was to be held in a five-year trusteeship. In southern Korea, this was met with immediate outrage, with nationwide strikes and protests. While Rhee begrudgingly accepted the news, Kim and others in the KPG began planning to resist the trusteeship. The KPG organized protests around the country. The left-leaning groups announced their support of the trusteeships and the Soviet Union, albeit with great internal dissent.

Likely with the approval of KPG leadership, the KPG&#x27;s covert militant sub-organization Central Political Task Force () posted public announcements that it would undermine US control of the south in order for the KPG to take over. US military governor of Korea John Hodge was furious at this announcement, and initially wanted Kim and the KPG to be arrested and deported back to China, but decided against this. Hodge summoned Kim for a meeting on January 1, 1946. Hodge demanded Kim quash the plan, and said that if Kim went back on his word he would be killed. Kim reportedly initially defiantly replied that he&#x27;d kill himself before that could happen. He eventually relented, and announced later that day via radio that the KPG would be respecting US control. Son evaluated the KPG&#x27;s plot as a blunder that alienated Kim from the US. The PRK and CPK were outraged by the KPG&#x27;s announcement, and issued statements and held rallies condemning Kim and the KPG.

=== North–South conference (1948) ===

In mid-April 1948, Kim went to the North. As the division of the newly-independent ROK state under the trusteeship became obvious, Kim led a team of former independence activists to Pyongyang to hold unification talks with Kim Il Sung, who later became the Premier of North Korea in 1948.While Kim Ku was still anti-Communist, he softened his stance in an effort to appease Kim Il Sung. In addition, many Koreans were then distrustful of the US, and unsure of whether the US would support South Korea in the event of a Northern invasion. In a 1985 interview with the Japanese magazine Sekai, Kim Il Sung claimed that Kim Ku asked him for political asylum in the event that his relationship with the US soured. Kim Il Sung then claimed that Kim Ku got on his knees and begged for forgiveness for his past anti-Communist actions. The truthfulness of the latter claim is doubted by several South Korean scholars.

Many of Kim Ku&#x27;s contemporaries and modern critics were skeptical of his appeasement efforts. The Kuomintang Minister in Seoul rebuked Kim in a July 11, 1948, conversation, saying &quot;damage has been done [...] by your recent activities in connection with the so-called North and South Korean Leaders&#x27; Conference held in Pyongyang&quot;.

Kim returned to the South deeply concerned that the North would handily win if it invaded the South.

In 1948, the inaugural Parliament of South Korea nominated Kim as a candidate for the office of the first president of the Republic. In the election by the National Assembly, Kim was defeated by Syngman Rhee, the first president of the Provisional Government, who had been impeached in 1925 by a vote of 180–16. He lost the election for the vice presidency to Yi Si-yeong by a vote of 133–59. Kim did not know about his nomination until after the election. He did not approve the nomination since he considered it a ploy to discredit him. Kim would never have participated in the election, as he fiercely opposed the establishment of separate governments in North and South Korea.

== Death ==

On June 26, 1949, while reading poetry in his office in the evening, Kim was shot four times by Lieutenant Ahn Doo-hee. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Years later, in 1996, Ahn himself was murdered by Park Gi-seo (), a bus driver and admirer of Kim Ku. The weapon involved in the murder was a 40 cm-long wooden rod, with &quot;Stick of Justice&quot; () and &quot;Reunification&quot; () written on it. In 2018, 70-year-old Park donated the stick, still faintly stained with the blood of Ahn, to the Museum of Japanese Colonial History in Korea.

=== Motive for assassination ===
Ahn stated that he had killed Kim because he saw him as an agent of the Soviet Union.According to Bruce Cumings&#x27;s 1981 book, another possible motive for the assassination was Kim Ku&#x27;s alleged connection to the assassination of Song Jin-woo, a leader of the Korean Democratic Party (KDP), who had chosen to work closely with the American military government.

On April 13, 1992, a confession by Ahn was published by &quot;The&quot; &quot;Dong-a Ilbo&quot;. In his confession, Ahn claimed that the assassination had been ordered by Kim Chang-ryong, who served as the head of Rhee&#x27;s national security. In 2001, declassified documents revealed that Ahn had been working for the U.S Counter-Intelligence Corps, leading to suggestions of American involvement in the assassination. However, some have questioned the evidence for those accusations.

== Legacy and honors ==

=== &quot;Diary of Kim Ku&quot;, his autobiography ===

His autobiography &quot;Diary of Kim Ku&quot; is an important source for the study of the Korean independence movement. It was designated cultural treasure No. 1245 by the Korean government on June 12, 1997.

=== Honors and awards ===
The street in Seoul and on top of the mountain Namsan are named after him.

In 1962, Kim was posthumously awarded the Republic of Korea Medal of Order of Merit for National Foundation, the most prestigious civil decoration in South Korea. On August 15, 1990, North Korea posthumously awarded him the National Reunification Prize.

Harvard University has maintained a Kim Koo Professor of Korean Studies position since 2004. Since 2005, the Korea Institute of Harvard has held the Kim Koo Forum on U.S.–Korea Relations. Since 2010, another Kim Koo Forum has been held at Peking University. In 2018, a third Kim Koo Forum was established in Seoul, which is dedicated to research around Kim and the KPG. In 2012, Tufts University established a Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor in Korean Studies position. In 2009, the Kim Koo Foundation and Kim&#x27;s great-granddaughter Jung Hwa Kim (&#x27;08) donated materials to Brown University to found the &quot;Kim Koo Korean Collection&quot;.

On October 22, 2002, the Kim Koo Museum was opened in Seoul. The South Korean government considers several objects associated with Kim Ku to be objects of cultural heritage. This includes a , the bloodied clothes Kim wore upon his assassination, and calligraphy that Kim produced.

In February 2023, Starbucks Korea announced that it would donate a piece of handwritten calligraphy by Kim to the Korean National Trust for Cultural Heritage. It also released special edition tumblers depicting the calligraphy.

=== Public opinion ===
In South Korea, Kim has been consistently regarded as one of the greatest figures in Korean history. In a 2008 survey by Korea Research, 44% of respondents credited Kim Ku for establishing South Korea, above the first president Syngman Rhee.

In anticipation of the 60th anniversary of South Korea&#x27;s founding, a national survey was conducted in 2007 on who should be portrayed on a new 100,000 Korean won bill, to be issued in 2009. On November 5, 2007, the Bank of Korea announced that Kim had won the vote. However, the new bill has been delayed indefinitely as of February 2023.

=== Characterization as a terrorist ===

For decades, there has been a debate in both academic and public settings over whether Kim can be considered a terrorist.

On July 19, 2007, Anders Karlsson of the University of London drew controversy while guest lecturing at Korea University when he described Kim&#x27;s Korean Patriotic Organization (KPO) as a &quot;terrorist group&quot;, and the KPO&#x27;s agents as &quot;terrorists&quot;. This characterization was immediately challenged by students in the course. One student pointed out that, unlike in September 11 attacks, Kim did not recklessly target civilians. However, Karlsson reportedly stood by his usage of the description at the time, and university administration stood by Karlsson&#x27;s qualifications. Word eventually spread to the &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot;, which reported on the incident. Karlsson then withdrew the description. He said that he used the characterization out of expediency, and acknowledged that the word &quot;terrorism&quot; carried significant unintended weight.

South Korean conservatives generally express more negative opinions about Kim, and have used this characterization as well. In 2009, an article in &quot;The Korea Times&quot; discussed a textbook it described as &quot;ultra right-wing&quot;. The textbook called Kim a terrorist and a &quot;left-wing politician who was against the founding of the Republic of Korea and made no contribution to the new nation&quot;. Park Geun-hye, then the leader of the Hannara Party and later President of South Korea, praised the textbook on May 26, 2008. Jeon Jeong-yoon, writing for &quot;The Hankyoreh&quot;, criticized the fact that only 5 pages of the book mentioned Kim, and most mentions were in negative contexts. Jeon noted that the book described Kim&#x27;s activities in the KPO as &quot;anti-Japanese terrorism&quot; (), which stood in contrast to the more common characterizations of &quot;passionate struggle&quot; () and &quot;independence activism&quot; (). According to a 2014 editorial also published in the &quot;Korea Times&quot;, a government-approved history textbook that described Kim as a terrorist was adopted in 14 high schools, around 1% of the 1,393 high schools in South Korea.

Steven Denney and Christopher Green wrote in &quot;Sino-NK&quot; that the KPO and its members have been described as terrorists in some circles in Japan, and that debate over the issue has contributed to conflict in Japan–South Korea relations.

== Personal life ==

Kim was married to Ch&#x27;oe Chun-rye (; March 19, 1889 – January 1, 1924) until she died in Shanghai at age 34. She was first seriously injured due to a fall, then died from pneumonia. She was then buried in the Shanghai French Concession.

=== Children ===
Kim had five children in total, three daughters and two sons, but only his sons survived past childhood. His first daughter Mi-sang () lived from 1906 to 1907. His second daughter Hwa-kyŏng () lived from 1910 to 1915. His third daughter Ŭn-kyŏng () from 1916 to 1917.

 (1917–1945) joined his father in exile in Shanghai at age 3, in 1920. He went back to Korea in 1927 and returned to China in 1934. Afterwards, he served various minor roles in the Provisional Government&#x27;s army. In 1940, he married , the niece of An Jung-geun. They had one daughter Kim Hyo-ja () in 1945, who was still living . He died at age 27 in 1945 of tuberculosis in Chengdu, Republic of China.

Kim Shin (1922–2016) served as the Chief of Staff of the Korean Air Force and a number of other roles in politics. After his retirement from public office, he managed the family&#x27;s various foundations. He died aged 93.

<doc id="572307" wikidata="Q2834206" url="?curid=572307" title="Alexandre de Marenches">
<text>Count Alexandre de Marenches (7 June 19212 June 1995) was a French military officer, a director of the SDECE French external intelligence services (6 November 1970 – 12 June 1981), special advisor to US President Ronald Reagan, and a member of the Academy of Morocco.

== Family ==
He was the son of Captain Charles-Constant-Marie de Marenches, a French aristocrat from a very old family of knights of Norman origin, an aide-de-camp to Marshal Ferdinand Foch and, together with Aldebert de Chambrun a representative of Marshal Philippe Pétain to General John J. Pershing. His mother, Margaret Clark Lestrade, (7 May 1881 New York3 May 1968 Paris) was a US citizen of distant French descent.

== Early life ==
In his youth, Marenches met many of the Allied leaders of World War I, including Marshal Foch and General Pershing. Marshal Petain was a witness at his parents&#x27; wedding. In 1939, as Count de Marenches, he joined the cavalry of the army and entered the field of intelligence by informing his relatives and contacts in the US of German activities in France im 1940. He narrowly escaped arrest by the Gestapo in 1942 by crossing the Pyrenees on foot and making his way to Algiers. He joined the French resistance there and played a distinguished role in the Italian Campaign. Wounded at the Battle of Monte Cassino, he became &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to General Alphonse Juin, the commander of the French forces in Italy (1943 — July 1944). There, Marenches helped coordinate the US military, the French expeditionary corps, and the eventual successful Allied advance into Rome.

After the war, he ventured into industry but remained in the Army Reserve and ultimately reached the rank of colonel. In 1962, he resigned in protest to President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s policy in Algeria.

== Appointment by Pompidou ==
He was eventually chosen to head the French intelligence services by French President Georges Pompidou mainly because of Marenches&#x27;s perceived independence and integrity. Pompidou was aware that factions in the intelligence services had been circulating defamatory rumours for the last six months of de Gaulle&#x27;s presidency on his wife and himself. Other rumours alleged Pompidou&#x27;s involvement with the film star Alain Delon, whose bodyguard had been found murdered in September 1968.

Some agents had taken the opportunity to smear Pompidou in revenge taking very firm action against some of their colleagues involved in the kidnapping of Ben Barka, the leader of the Moroccan opposition in 1965. Marenches was brought in to clear up the factions. The fact that Marenches had been close to de Gaulle&#x27;s former comrade-in-arms, Alphonse Juin, may have also played a role in the original choice.

In 1970, he was installed as head of the SDECE, the forerunner of the current DGSE. He deliberately carried out Pompidou&#x27;s instruction to clean up the service and was indifferent to any protests on his actions. A natural activist, he began to travel and to meet with other governments to pursue the interests of France in different parts of the world.

== Under Giscard d&#x27;Estaing ==
He had such authority that when Giscard d&#x27;Estaing succeeded Pompidou as president in 1974, Marenches kept his position for 11 years. Tellingly, when Pompidou died, and the key to his personal safe was deemed lost, Marenches was found to be in possession of another one. In chapter 7 (&quot;Serving Two Masters&quot;) of his autobiography and in &quot;The Fourth World War&quot;, Marenches says that Pompidou&#x27;s safe in
Elysee Palace was opened by one of the Secret Services&#x27; safecrackers only after Marenches had summoned Pompidou&#x27;s son and his chef du cabinet as witnesses to its contents.

Under Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, Marenches tried to awaken interest in the former Portuguese colonies in Africa, and when Giscard d&#x27;Estaing protested that they were a long way away, he answered, &quot;Yes, but they are getting nearer&quot;. Like many others in the intelligence community, Marenches resented Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s lack of concern about the communist threat and, more generally, about Giscard&#x27;s deliberate ignorance that &quot;History is tragic&quot;. More specifically, Marenches was adamant that France should continue supporting the pro-Western rebel leader Jonas Savimbi in the Angolan Civil War with the aim of installing a pro-Western regime in Angola, whereas Giscard wanted to discontinue French aid by 1978. Marenches decided to disobey Giscard and maintained a clandestine arms export to Savimbi&#x27;s UNITA. In 1980, Marenches personally visited Savimbi&#x27;s rebel base.

== Achievements ==
It is difficult to assess Marenches&#x27;s achievements. Some believed that while he was one of the busiest figures on the intelligence circuit, some of his pronouncements (such as those on the Soviet Union) were based on slander. Others noted how he successfully cultivated his contacts in the Middle East, pushed the sales of Dassault Mirage fighters, and helped to establish a relationship with Iraq that persisted. In Africa, sometimes working with the old Gaullist emissary Jacques Foccart and sometimes behaving as his rival, Marenches strengthened France&#x27;s traditional strongholds.

He co-founded the Safari Club, a &quot;private intelligence group [which was] one of George H. W. Bush&#x27;s many end runs around congressional oversight of the American intelligence establishment and the locus of many of the worst features of the mammoth BCCI scandal.&quot; The Club involved a number of states, including Saudi Arabia (which financed the operations), Morocco, Egypt and Iran, and was intended to counter Soviet operations in the Middle East and Africa.

An interlocutor with many heads of state in the world and a close friend of King Hassan II of Morocco, he was elected member of the Academy of Morocco. After the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency of the United States, he would have become, according to the American journalist Colley, one of his closest advisers doing business in Afghanistan.

Im &quot;Dans le secret des princes&quot;, he states he was asked by an American journalist, who was a distant relative, where he could go in the world to write an article on an important geopolitical situation that was almost unknown. Marenches proposes several places. The journalist answers that he wanted one place. Marenches chooses randomly Afghanistan, because of the threat of a Soviet invasion. The journalist asked US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski if Afghanistan could be an interesting place to write. Brzezinski said that it was not an interesting place. The journalist left for Kabul, &quot;arriving in the same time as the Soviet tanks did&quot;, just a coincidence.

Marenches also conceived Operation Mosquito. In a meeting with Reagan at the White House, he suggested for the Drug Enforcement Administration to take all the drugs confiscated and supply them covertly to the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. In a few months, he explained, it would be demoralized, and its fighting ability would be gone. Marenches added, according to his published memoirs, that a few trusted people could do all that at a cost of approximately a million dollars. 

Marenches also told Reagan that the United States controlled only four of the eight strategic raw materials and that the Soviets controlled all of them.

Édouard Balladur knew Marenches well from when they were both working closely with Pompidou. When Balladur was prime minister, he was due to preside over a medal-awarding ceremony. He was suddenly unable to attend and so asked Marenches to take his place. That was a serious mark of Balladur&#x27;s respect and friendship.

At 6&#x27;4&quot; and heavily built, he was called Porthos in reference to the character in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Charismatic and colourful, he was popular for his valour and patriotism.

== Resignation ==
After the French Socialist Party came to power in 1981, Marenches resigned that year because of the presence of French Communist Party in the government. He disapproved of the new organization of security. He was particularly scathing about the fiasco of the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, but he accepted a seat on the Constitutional Council.

== Publications ==
In 1986, along with journalist Christine Ockrent, he co-authored a book, &quot;Dans le secret des princes&quot; (&quot;In the Princes&#x27; Secret&quot;, published in English as &quot;The Evil Empire: Third World War Continues&quot;) about his days working in secret services. Claims were made on concealed archives with evidence of collaboration with Germans by figures of the French Resistance during the French Occupation.

In 1988, he published in French an &quot;Atlas géopolitique&quot;. 

In 1992, along with David A. Andelman, he co-authored &quot;The Fourth World War: Diplomacy and Espionage in the Age of Terrorism&quot;, a book in which he predicted the rise of terrorism as a new form of warfare. The book became popular following the September 11 attacks.

<text>Richard James Anthony Noble, OBE (born 6 March 1946) is a Scottish entrepreneur who was holder of the land speed record between 1983 and 1997. He was also the project director of ThrustSSC, the vehicle which holds the current land speed record, set at Black Rock Desert, Nevada in 1997.

==Life==

Noble was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and educated at Winchester College. He became a qualified pilot.

In 1984 he exploited a production hiatus at Cessna aircraft to create the ARV Super2, a new all-British light aircraft. The Super2 was fitted with a new British engine, the Hewland AE75. Only around 40 ARVs were made before the Isle of Wight factory closed.

Thrust2, the record-breaking car driven by Noble, travelled at 633.468 mph (1019 km/h) in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada, US. The accomplishment won Noble the 1983 Segrave Trophy. ThrustSSC, the supersonic car driven by Andy Green, broke the record at 763.035 mph (1221 km/h) or Mach 1.02. Noble was planning another land speed record attempt to take place in 2019: Bloodhound SSC which aimed to surpass 1,000 mph but the project went into bankruptcy and was sold to Ian Warhurst. Noble remained a Director on both Bloodhound Project and Bloodhound Education Ltd. Bloodhound Education is a stand-alone charity which is funded by grants from corporate sponsors such as Saudi Aramco and others.  

Noble&#x27;s next project was to develop the &quot;Farnborough F1&quot;, a six-passenger single-engined turboprop low-wing aircraft designed as an &quot;Air Taxi&quot; that could operate out of small airstrips. The intended market was to provide transport for businessmen who found the existing air, rail and road networks too inflexible and expensive. Noble started Farnborough Aircraft in 1998, but after failing to find backing from any major financial institution, sold shares to small investors. A bitter dispute followed, and development stopped while new investment was found. The rights to the design were transferred and the aircraft renamed Kestrel K-350. A prototype aircraft first flew in 2006 but certification and production remain uncertain.

In 2010 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Technology by the University of the West of England.

Noble&#x27;s autobiography is titled &quot;Thrust: The Remarkable Story of One Man&#x27;s Quest for Speed&quot;.
