<text>The Vagina Monologues is an episodic play written in 1996 by Eve Ensler which developed and premiered at HERE Arts Center, Off-Off-Broadway in New York and was followed by an Off-Broadway run at the Westside Theatre. The play explores consensual and nonconsensual sexual experiences, body image, genital mutilation, direct and indirect encounters with reproduction, vaginal care, menstrual periods, prostitution, and several other topics through the eyes of women with various ages, races, sexualities, and other differences.

Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the play &quot;probably the most important piece of political theater of the last decade.&quot;

In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated &quot;No recent hour of theater has had a greater impact worldwide&quot; in an article &quot;The Great Work Continues: The 25 Best American Plays Since &#x27;Angels in America.

Ensler originally starred in both the HERE premiere and in the first off-Broadway production, which was produced by David Stone, Nina Essman, Dan Markley, The Araca Group, Willa Shalit and the West Side Theater. When she left the play, it was recast with three celebrity monologists. The play has been staged internationally, and a television version featuring Ensler was produced by cable TV channel HBO. In 1998, Ensler and others, including Willa Shalit, a producer of the Westside Theatre production, launched V-Day, a global non-profit movement that has raised over for groups working to end violence against women (including those who hold fluid identities that are subject to gender-based violence), through benefits of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

In 2011, Ensler was awarded the Isabelle Stevenson Award at the 65th Tony Awards, which recognizes an individual from the theater community who has made a substantial contribution of volunteered time and effort on behalf of humanitarian, social service, or charitable organizations for her creation of the V-Day movement.

== History ==
Eve Ensler wrote the first draft of the monologues in 1996 (there have been several revisions since) following interviews she conducted with 200 women about their views on sex, relationships, and violence against women. The interviews began as casual conversations with her friends, who then brought up anecdotes they themselves had been told by other friends; this began a continuing chain of referrals. In an interview with Women.com, Ensler said that her fascination with vaginas began because of &quot;growing up in a violent society&quot;. &quot;Women&#x27;s empowerment is deeply connected to their sexuality.&quot; She also stated, &quot;I&#x27;m obsessed with women being violated and raped, and with incest. All of these things are deeply connected to our vaginas.&quot;

Ensler wrote the piece to &quot;celebrate the vagina&quot;. Ensler states that in 1998, the purpose of the piece changed from a celebration of vaginas and femininity to a movement to stop violence against women. This was the start of the V-Day movement which has continued strong every year since, has turned into a worldwide phenomenon, and a very successful non-profit organization.

The play opened at HERE Arts Center in New York City on October 3, 1996, with a limited run that was scheduled to end November 15 but was extended to December 31. The play gained popularity through sold-out performances, media coverage and word of mouth. &quot;In 2001, V-Day sold out New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden with more than seventy actors performing. The evening raised $1 million raised for groups working to end violence against women and girls.&quot;

&quot;After &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; debuted in 1996, it quickly became a hit. Soon, Eve Ensler&#x27;s episodic play had graduated from off-off Broadway to Madison Square Garden to college stages the world over.&quot;

In 2004, an all-transgender performance of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; was held for the first time. The performance was covered by the 2006 documentary &quot;Beautiful Daughters&quot;, which displays the hardships the all-transgender cast faced with the production.

The play was also adapted into a Marathi play called &quot;Yonichya Maneechya Gujagoshti&quot; by feminist writer-activist Vandana Khare in the year 2009.

Gabriela Youth, the one and only national democratic mass organization for young women in the Philippines also adapted the play into a Tagalog theatrical show called &quot;Ang Usapang Puke&quot; with its student members from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines in the year 2018.

== Plot summary ==
&quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; is made up of personal monologues read by a diverse group of women. Originally, Eve Ensler performed every monologue herself, with subsequent performances featuring three actresses, and more recent versions featuring a different actress for every role. Each of the monologues deals with an aspect of the feminine experience, touching on matters such as sex, sex work, body image, love, rape, menstruation, female genital mutilation, masturbation, birth, orgasm, the common names for the vagina or simply as a physical aspect of the body. A recurring theme throughout the piece is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment, and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.

Some monologues include:

* &quot;I Was Twelve, My Mother Slapped Me&quot;: a chorus describing many young women&#x27;s and girls&#x27; first menstrual period.
* &quot;Hair,&quot; a piece in which a woman discusses how her husband had cheated on her because she had refused to shave her pubic hair, ultimately allowing her to see that it should not matter whether or not she chooses to shave, and that &quot;hair is there for a reason&quot;.
* &quot;My Angry Vagina&quot;, in which a woman humorously rants about injustices wrought against the vagina, such as tampons, douches, and the tools used by OB/GYNs.
* &quot;My Vagina Was My Village&quot;, a monologue compiled from the testimonies of Bosnian women subjected to rape camps.
* &quot;The Little Coochie Snorcher That Could&quot;, in which a woman recalls memories of traumatic sexual experiences in her childhood and a self-described &quot;positive healing&quot; sexual experience in her adolescent years with an older woman. This particular skit has sparked outrage, numerous controversies and criticisms due to its content, among which the most famous is the Robert Swope controversy (see below). In the original version she is 13, but later versions changed her age to 16. It also originally included the line, &quot;If it was rape, it was a good rape&quot;, which was removed from later versions.
* &quot;Reclaiming Cunt&quot;, a piece narrated by a woman who illustrates that the word &quot;cunt&quot; itself is an empowering word when reclaimed, despite its history of disconcerting connotations.
* &quot;The Woman Who Loved to Make Vaginas Happy&quot;, in which a sex worker for women discusses the intriguing details of her career and her love of giving women pleasure. In several performances it often comes at the end of the play, literally climaxing with a vocal demonstration of a &quot;triple orgasm&quot;.
* &quot;Because He Liked to Look At It&quot;, in which a woman describes how she had thought her vagina was ugly and had been embarrassed to even think about it, but changed her mind because of a sexual experience with a man named Bob who liked to spend hours looking at it.
* &quot;I Was There in the Room&quot;, a monologue in which Eve Ensler describes the birth of her granddaughter in graphic detail and positive wonder.

Every year a new monologue is added to highlight another issue affecting women around the world. In 2003, for example, Ensler wrote a new monologue, called &quot;Under the Burqa&quot;, about the plight of women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. In 2004, Ensler wrote one called &quot;They Beat the Girl Out of My Boy. . .Or So They Tried&quot; after interviewing a group of women whose gender differed from that assigned to them at birth. Every V-Day thousands of local benefit productions are staged to raise funds for local groups, shelters, and crisis centers working to end violence against women.

== V-Day ==


V-Day is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization that distributes funds to national and international grassroot organizations and programs that work to stop violence against girls and women. &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; is the cornerstone of the V-Day movement, whose participants stage benefit performances of the show and/or host other related events in their communities. Such events take place worldwide each year between 1 February and 30 April, many on college campuses as well. All performances must stick to the annual script that V-Day puts out specifically for the V-Day productions of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. The V-Day organization encourages the renditions to include as many diverse actors as possible. With a minimum of 5 actors required by V-Day, the organization also has no maximum limit on the number of actors that can be included in the productions and encourages inclusion of as many actors as possible. The performances generally benefit rape crisis centers and shelters for women, as well as similar resource centers for women and girls experiencing violence against them.

On 21 February 2004, Ms. Ensler in conjunction with Jane Fonda and Deep Stealth Productions produced and directed the first all-transgender performance of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, with readings by eighteen notable transgender women and including a new monologue documenting the experiences of transgender women. It debuted in connection with &quot;LA V-DAY Until the Violence Stops&quot; with monologues documenting the violence against transgender women. Since that debut, many university and college productions have included these three &quot;Transgender Monologues&quot;. &quot;Beautiful Daughters&quot; (2006) is a documentary about the cast of the first performance by transgender women.

== Support ==
An article in &quot;Signs&quot; by Christine M. Cooper begins by applauding &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; for benefit performances done within the first six years (1998–2004). These performances raised over $20 million, 85 percent of which was donated to grassroots organizations that fight against violence towards women.

== Criticism ==
=== Criticism from feminists ===
&quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; has been criticized by some within the feminist movement, including pro-sex feminists and individualist feminists. Sex-positive feminist Betty Dodson, author of several books about female sexuality, saw the play as having a narrow and restrictive view of sexuality. Dodson&#x27;s main concern seemed to be the lack of the term &quot;clitoris&quot; throughout the play. She believes that the play sends a message that the vagina is the main sex organ, not the clitoris. There is also criticism of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; about its conflation of vaginas with women, more specifically for the message of the play that women are their vaginas, as Susan E. Bell and Susan M. Reverby argue, &quot;Generations of feminists have argued that we are more than our bodies, more than a vagina or &#x27;the sex&#x27;. Yet, TVM re-inscribes women&#x27;s politics in our bodies, indeed in our vaginas alone.&quot; The focus on women finding themselves through their vaginas, many say, seems more like a Second Wave consciousness-raising group rather than a ground-breaking, inter-sectional, Third Wave cornerstone.

=== Criticism for being anti-transgender ===
Because of the title and content of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; being body-centric, American University chose to change their production of it to a new show including all-original pieces, giving the production the name of &quot;Breaking Ground Monologues.&quot; Although members of American University&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Initiative believe that the show &quot;was&quot; revolutionary in the 1990s, they concluded that equating having a vagina with being a woman is not an accurate display of womanhood in the 2010s, suggesting that &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; continues to perpetuate the gender binary and erase the identity of those who are genderqueer.

In 2015 a student organization at Mount Holyoke College canceled its annual performance of the play for being, in its opinion, insufficiently inclusive of transgender people. &quot;At its core&quot;, Erin Murphy, the president of the school&#x27;s theater group, said, &quot;the show offers an extremely narrow perspective on what it means to be a woman. … Gender is a wide and varied experience, one that cannot simply be reduced to biological or anatomical distinctions, and many of us who have participated in the show have grown increasingly uncomfortable presenting material that is inherently reductionist and exclusive.&quot; The traditionally all-female college had begun admitting trans women the previous year, but the college denied that had anything to do with the decision to discontinue the annual performances of the play.

=== Criticism for being colonial ===
Kim Hall, a professor of philosophy at Appalachian State University, further criticizes the play, particularly the sections dealing with women in developing countries, for contributing to &quot;colonialist conceptions of non-Western women&quot;, such as the piece &quot;My Vagina Was My Village.&quot; Although she supports frank discussions about sex, Hall rescales many of the same critiques leveled by feminists of color at &quot;White privilege&quot; among second-wave feminists: &quot;premature white feminist assumptions and celebrations of a global &#x27;sisterhood.&#x27;&quot;

In &quot;The Vagina Monologues,&quot; depictions of sexual violence are told through mostly non-white and non-US centered stories, as Srimati Basu states, &quot;While a few of these forms of violence, such as sexual assault and denigration of genitalia, are depicted in U.S. locations, violence is the primary register through which &#x27;the global&#x27; is evoked, the main lens for looking outside the United States. These global locations serve to signify the terror that is used to hold the laughter in balance, to validate the seriousness of the enterprise, while the &#x27;vagina&#x27; pieces are more directly associated with pleasure and sexuality and set in the United States.&quot;

In 2013, Columbia University&#x27;s V-Day decided to stage the play with a cast entirely of non-White women. That decision, too, was controversial.

=== Social conservative criticism ===
The play has also been criticized by social conservatives, such as the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property (TFP) and the Network of Enlightened Women. The TFP denounced it as &quot;a piece replete with sexual encounters, lust, graphic descriptions of masturbation and lesbian behavior&quot;, urging students and parents to protest. Following TFP and other protests, performances were cancelled at sixteen Catholic colleges. Saint Louis University made the decision not to endorse the 2007 production, claiming the yearly event was getting to be &quot;redundant&quot;. The response of the university&#x27;s student-led feminist organization was to continue the production at an off-campus location.

=== Robert Swope (&#x27;good rape&#x27;) critique ===
In 2000, Robert Swope, a conservative contributor to a Georgetown University newspaper, &quot;The Hoya&quot;, wrote an article critical of the play. He suggested there was a contradiction between the promotion of rape awareness on V-Day and the monologue &quot;The Little Coochie Snorcher That Could&quot;, in which an adult woman recalls that being given alcohol and statutorily raped at 13 by a 24-year-old woman was a positive, healing experience, ending the segment with the proclamation &quot;It was a good rape.&quot;

Outcry from the play&#x27;s supporters resulted in Swope being fired from the staff of &quot;The Hoya&quot;, before the piece was even run. Swope had previously criticized the play in an article he wrote entitled &quot;Georgetown Women&#x27;s Center: Indispensable Asset or Improper Expenditure?&quot; His termination received critical editorial coverage in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Salon&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, and by Wendy McElroy of iFeminists.

The controversy resulted in the script being modified in 2008 to change the age of the statutorily raped girl from 13 to 16 and to remove the &quot;good rape&quot; line.

== College performances ==
Every year, the play is performed on hundreds of college campuses as part of V-Day&#x27;s College campaign.

Inspired by &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, many colleges have gone on to develop their own plays. Performances at colleges are always different, not always pre-written, and sometimes feature actors writing their own monologue. &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; also served as inspiration for &quot;Yoni Ki Baat&quot;, the &quot;South Asian adaptation of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;&quot;, and as loose inspiration for &quot;The Manic Monologues&quot;, &quot;the mental-illness version of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.&quot;

The Cardinal Newman Society has criticized the performance of the play on Catholic college campuses. In 2011 ten of the fourteen Catholic universities hosting the &quot;Monologues&quot; were Jesuit institutions. The Jesuit Tim Clancy, pastor and philosophy professor at Gonzaga University, explains why he supports VM performances on campus: &quot;They are not arguments – they are stories … stories of pain and suffering, stories of shame, violation and impotence&quot; that lead to discussions on &quot;the extremes of the human condition&quot;, responding to the call of Pope Benedict for Jesuits in their work to explore &quot;the boundaries resulting from an erroneous or superficial vision of God and man that stand between faith and human knowledge&quot;.

<text>In politics and economics, a Potemkin village () is a construction (literal or figurative) whose purpose is to provide an external façade to a situation, to make people believe that the situation is better than it actually is. The term comes from stories of a fake portable village built by Grigory Potemkin, a field marshal and former lover of Empress Catherine II, solely to impress the Empress during her journey to Crimea in 1787. Modern historians agree that accounts of this portable village are exaggerated. The original story was that Potemkin erected phony portable settlements along the banks of the Dnieper River in order to impress the Russian Empress and foreign guests. The structures would be disassembled after she passed, and re-assembled farther along her route to be seen again.

== Origin ==

Grigory Potemkin was a minister and lover of the Russian Empress Catherine II. After the 1783 Russian annexation of Crimea from the Ottoman Empire and &quot;liquidation&quot; of the Cossack Zaporozhian Sich (see New Russia), Potemkin became governor of the region. Crimea had been devastated by the war, and the Muslim Tatar inhabitants of Crimea were viewed as a potential fifth column of the Ottoman Empire. Potemkin&#x27;s major tasks were to pacify and rebuild by bringing in Russian settlers. In 1787, as a new war was about to break out between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, Catherine II, with her court and several ambassadors, made an unprecedented six-month trip to New Russia. One purpose of this trip was to impress Russia&#x27;s allies prior to the war. To help accomplish this, Potemkin was said to have set up &quot;mobile villages&quot; on the banks of the Dnieper River. As soon as the barge carrying the Empress and ambassadors arrived, Potemkin&#x27;s men, dressed as peasants, would populate the village. Once the barge left, the village was disassembled, then rebuilt downstream overnight.

=== Historical accuracy ===
According to Simon Sebag-Montefiore, Potemkin&#x27;s most comprehensive English-language biographer, the tale of elaborate, fake settlements, with glowing fires designed to comfort the monarch and her entourage as they surveyed the barren territory at night, is largely fictional. Aleksandr Panchenko, an established specialist on 19th-century Russia, used original correspondence and memoirs to conclude that the Potemkin villages are a myth. He writes: &quot;Based on the above said we must conclude that the myth of &#x27;Potemkin villages&#x27; is exactly a myth, and not an established fact.&quot; He writes that &quot;Potyomkin indeed decorated existing cities and villages, but made no secret that this was a decoration&quot;.

The close relationship between Potemkin and the empress could have made it difficult for him to deceive her. Thus, if there were deception, it would have been mainly directed towards the foreign ambassadors accompanying the imperial party.

Although &quot;Potemkin village&quot; has come to mean, especially in a political context, any hollow or false construct, a facade, physical or figurative, meant to hide an undesirable or potentially damaging situation, it is possible that the phrase cannot be applied accurately to its own original historical inspiration. According to some historians, some of the buildings were real, and others were constructed to show what the region would look like in the near future, and at least Catherine and possibly also her foreign visitors knew which were which. According to these historians, the claims of deception were part of a defamation campaign against Potemkin.

According to a legend, in 1787, when Catherine passed through Tula on her way back from the trip, the local governor Mikhail Krechetnikov attempted a deception of that kind in order to hide the effects of a bad harvest.

== Modern usage ==


In the Old West of the United States, Western false front architecture was often used to create the illusion of affluence and stability in a new frontier town. The style included a tall vertical façade with a square top in front of a wood-framed building, often hiding a gable roof. The goal for the architecture was to project an image of stability and success for the town, while the business owners did not invest much in buildings that might be temporary. These towns often did not last long before becoming ghost towns, so businessmen wanted to get started quickly but did not want to spend a lot on their stores. Many Western movies feature this kind of architecture because, just like the original buildings, it is quick and cheap to create.

Many of the newly constructed base areas at ski resorts are referred to as Potemkin villages. These create the illusion of a quaint mountain town, but are actually carefully planned theme shopping centers, hotels and restaurants designed for maximum revenue. Similarly, in &quot;The Geography of Nowhere&quot;, American writer James Howard Kunstler refers to contemporary suburban shopping centers as &quot;Potemkin village shopping plazas&quot;.

Sometimes, instead of the full phrase, just &quot;Potemkin&quot; is used, as an adjective. For example, the use of a row of trees to screen a clearcut area from motorists has been called a &quot;Potemkin forest&quot;. The glossary entry for &quot;clearcut&quot; in &quot;We Have The Right To Exist: A Translation of Aboriginal Indigenous Thought&quot; states that &quot;Much of the extensive clearcut in northern Minnesota is insulated from scrutiny by the urbanized public by a Potemkin forest, or, as the D.N.R. terms it, an aesthetic strip – a thin illusion of forest about six trees deep, along most highways and fronting waters frequented by tourists.&quot; Another example is the phrase &quot;Potemkin court&quot;, which implies that the court&#x27;s reason to exist is being called into question (differing from the phrase &quot;kangaroo court&quot; with which the court&#x27;s standard of justice is being impugned).

&quot;Potemkin village&quot; is a phrase that has been used by American judges, especially members of a multiple-judge panel who dissent from the majority&#x27;s opinion on a particular matter, to refer to an inaccurate or tortured interpretation and/or application of a particular legal doctrine to the specific facts at issue. Use of the phrase is meant to imply that the reasons espoused by the panel&#x27;s majority in support of its decision are not based on accurate or sound law, and their restrictive application is merely a masquerade for the court&#x27;s desire to avoid a difficult decision. For example, in &quot;Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey&quot; (1992), chief justice of the United States William Rehnquist wrote that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; &quot;stands as a sort of judicial Potemkin Village, which may be pointed out to passers-by as a monument to the importance of adhering to precedent&quot;. Similarly, Judge William G. Young of the District of Massachusetts described the use of affidavits in U.S. litigation as &quot;the Potemkin Village of today&#x27;s litigation landscape&quot; because &quot;adjudication by affidavit is like walking down a street between two movie sets, all lawyer-painted façade and no interior architecture.&quot;

<text>A Wedding for Bella (formerly titled &quot;The Bread, My Sweet&quot;) is a 2001 American romantic drama film that told the story of a successful businessman who trades in his single lifestyle to marry the estranged daughter of a terminally ill elderly woman whom he loves like a mother. The marriage is a sham in order to give the elderly woman happiness before her death.

Written and directed by Melissa Martin, the film is set in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Strip District, a thriving and diverse open-air market. Part love-story to the city that serves as its setting, the film is also a loving homage to the personalities of three people who each had an impact on director Melissa Martin.

Bella, the title character, and her husband, Massimo, are the creative embodiments of an elderly Italian-American couple who owned, and lived above The Enrico Biscotti Company (the real-life Pittsburgh bakery served as an inspiration for the film).

The film was directed by Martin, and starred Scott Baio as the businessman, Rosemary Prinz (as the dying elderly woman), Kristin Minter as Lucca, the estranged daughter, and Shuler Hensley. Then 70 years old, Prinz, a soap opera mainstay, made her feature film debut. This film has been presented at many film festivals across America.

<doc id="573156" wikidata="Q1004533" url="?curid=573156" title="Bullionism">
<text>Bullionism is an economic theory that defines wealth by the amount of precious metals owned. Bullionism is an early and perhaps more primitive form of mercantilism. It was derived, during the 16th century, from the observation that the Kingdom of England, because of its large trade surplus, possessed large amounts of gold and silver—bullion—despite the fact that there was not any mining of precious metals in England.

== History ==
Bullionism was born in what now is known as Spain. Following the Reconquista, the region fell victim to a deep economic slump. This prompted local scientists to look for ways to revive the region&#x27;s economy. Some noted that England had accumulated vast reserves of gold and silver thanks to its trade surplus, and established a link between the possession of precious metals and the wealth of the country.

Although the supporters of Bullionism did not write theoretical treatises on the subject (unlike the precursors of the classical school in the following century), they did mobilize many leaders. In 1558 Ortiz wrote a memoir to the king to prevent the exits of gold. The doctrine was developing mainly in this region, because the influx of precious metals from America led to a sharp increase in purchasing power in the short term, which the authors saw as an implicit confirmation of their theory. King Charles V of latter Spain and his son King Philip II did follow the bullionist recommendations.

==Examples of bullionists==
Thomas Milles (1550–1627) and others recommended that England increase exports to create a trade surplus, convert the surplus into precious metals, and hinder the drain of money and precious metal to other countries. England did restrict exportation of money or precious metals around 1600, but Milles wanted to resume using staple ports (ports where incoming foreign merchants were required to offer their goods for sale before anywhere else) to force merchants from abroad to use their assets to buy English goods and prevent them from transferring gold or silver from England homewards. Milles&#x27;s opinions, however, were not widely valued. One of his contemporaries wrote, &quot;Milles was so much out of step with the time that his pamphlets had little influence.&quot;

Gerard de Malynes (1586–1641), another bullionist, published a book named &quot;A Treatise of the Canker of England&#x27;s Common Wealth&quot;, that asserted that the exchange of foreign currency had been a trade of value rather than exchanging the weight of metals. Therefore, the unfair exchanging of precious metals by bankers and money changers would cause a deficit in the English balance of trade. To ban the flow of exchange rates, he demanded the strict fixing of exchange rates for coins, only by the concentration of precious metals and weights, and for strict regulation and monitoring of foreign trade. He failed, however, to convince his contemporaries “...that the cambists were responsible for gold outflow or to elicit enthusiasm for a monopoly sale of exchange, par pro pari, by the royal exchanger.&quot; He did succeed in creating one of the first economic controversies, and Edward Misselden opposed him in 1623 in his book &quot;The Circle of Commerce: Or, the Balance of Trade&quot;.

<text>Sycorax is the largest irregular satellite of Uranus. It was discovered in September, 1997 on the Hale Telescope in California. Sycorax&#x27;s orbit is retrograde, irregular, and much more distant than that of Oberon, the furthest of Uranus&#x27; regular moons. With a diameter of over , it is the largest irregular moon of Uranus. It has been theorized that Sycorax is a captured object, as opposed to one formed with Uranus.

== Discovery ==
Sycorax was discovered on 6 September 1997 by Brett J. Gladman, Philip D. Nicholson, Joseph A. Burns, and John J. Kavelaars using the 200-inch Hale Telescope, together with Caliban. At the time, it was given the temporary designation S/1997 U 2. Officially confirmed as Uranus XVII, it was named after Sycorax, Caliban&#x27;s mother in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;. This follows the trend that all Uranian moons are named after Shakespearean characters or those from Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;.

== Orbit ==

Sycorax follows a distant orbit, more than 20 times further from Uranus than the furthest regular moon, Oberon. Its orbit is retrograde, moderately inclined and eccentric. The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Setebos and Prospero, to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin.

The diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of the retrograde irregular satellites of Uranus (in polar co-ordinates) with the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre.

== Physical characteristics ==

The diameter of Sycorax is estimated at , based on the thermal emission data from Spitzer and Herschel Space telescopes making it the largest irregular satellite of Uranus, comparable in size with Puck and with Himalia, the biggest irregular satellite of Jupiter.

The satellite appears &quot;light-red&quot; in the visible spectrum (colour indices , , ), redder than Himalia but still less red than most Kuiper belt objects. However, in the near infrared, the spectrum turns blue between 0.8 and 1.25 μm and finally becomes neutral at the longer wavelengths.

The rotation period of Sycorax is estimated at 6.9 hours. Rotation causes periodical variations of the visible magnitude with the amplitude of 0.12. The rotation axis of Sycorax is unknown, though measurements of its light curve suggest it is being viewed at a near equator-on configuration. In this case, Sycorax may have a north pole right ascension around 356° and a north pole declination around 45°.

== Origin ==
It is hypothesized that Sycorax is a captured object; it did not form in the accretion disk which existed around Uranus just after its formation. No exact capture mechanism is known, but capturing a moon requires the dissipation of energy. Possible capture processes include gas drag in the protoplanetary disk and many-body interactions and capture during the fast growth of Uranus&#x27;s mass (so-called &quot;pull-down&quot;).

<doc id="573160" wikidata="Q741548" url="?curid=573160" title="Space Shuttle Pathfinder">
<text>The Space Shuttle &quot;Pathfinder&quot; (unofficial Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-098) is a Space Shuttle test simulator made of steel and wood. Constructed by NASA in 1977 as an unnamed facilities test article, it was purchased in the early 1980s by the America-Japan Society, Inc. which had it refurbished, named it, and placed it on display in the Great Space Shuttle Exhibition in Tokyo. The mockup was later returned to the United States and placed on permanent display at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, in May 1988.

==Activities==
Originally unnamed, the simulator was built at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 1977 for use in activities such as checking roadway clearances, crane capabilities and fits within structures. It was later shipped by barge to the Kennedy Space Center and was used for ground crew testing in the Vehicle Assembly Building, Orbiter Processing Facility, and Shuttle Landing Facility. &quot;Pathfinder&quot; is approximately the same size, shape and weight of an actual orbiter. Using &quot;Pathfinder&quot; allowed for facilities testing without requiring use of the more delicate and expensive &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==Refurbishment==

After sitting in storage for many years, the America-Japan Society, Inc. obtained the wood and steel mockup at a cost of US$1 million and hired Teledyne Brown Engineering to refurbish it to more closely resemble an actual Space Shuttle. It was named &quot;Pathfinder&quot; and displayed at the Great Space Shuttle Exposition in Tokyo from June 1983 to August 1984.

==U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center==
After the exhibit, &quot;Pathfinder&quot; returned to the United States. The U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama designed the display and built a stand. NASA provided MPTA-ET and two filament-wound Solid Rocket Booster casings, which had been designed for polar-orbit launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base.

On February 16, 1988, NASA shipped MPTA-ET, an external tank which had been used for propulsion tests with MPTA-098, on an open barge from Stennis Space Center in Mississippi up the river to Michoud, where it was transferred to the Orion barge to sail up the river to Marshall Space Flight Center. The tank, not having been designed to hold the weight of an orbiter at an angle, required reinforcements. NASA installed I-beam spokes in the tank at Marshall, in building 4705. &quot;Pathfinder&quot;″s weight is concentrated in the tail, though, and the tank required further reinforcements. The tank was then transported over land to the display at the museum.

In May 1988, the 89-ton &quot;Pathfinder&quot; was installed atop the display at the Space &amp; Rocket Center.

In 1999, NASA removed the forward assemblies from each SRB attached to the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; stack. Although the SRBs are recovered and reused after each flight, several of the forward assemblies had been damaged or lost over the history of the Space Shuttle program necessitating requisition of those attached to the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; stack as spares.

In 2008, repairs were made to the forward part of the mockup after decades of exposure to the weather had corroded the floor section near the vehicle&#x27;s nose. This corrosion caused the &quot;belly pan&quot; to drop from a mounting bracket onto the external tank. The damaged area was part of the fiberglass and plywood added to the mockup before its exhibition in Japan.

In 2020 the Center received a &quot;Save America&#x27;s Treasures&quot; grant for $500,000 from the National Park Service. The project began with the wings and tail section temporarily removed between January and February 2021. On February 8, the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; was lowered from its mounting points atop the fuel tank for the first time since May 5, 1988. The restoration project is proceeding alongside cooperation with the Marshall Space Flight Center, who will assist in assessing the structural integrity of the test shuttle.

On Aug. 28, 2024, two cranes lifted the body of Pathfinder back into position on the shuttle stack in the first phase of a multi-day reassembly process. The reattachment of the wings and engine bells were scheduled to follow, completing the restoration of the display.

<doc id="573162" wikidata="Q269903" url="?curid=573162" title="Louisa Hanoune">
<text>Louisa Hanoune (; born 7 April 1954) is the head of Algeria&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Party (Parti des Travailleurs, PT). In 2004, she became the first woman to run for President of Algeria. Hanoune was imprisoned by the government several times prior to the legalization of political parties in 1988. She was jailed soon after she joined the Trotskyist Social Workers Organisation, an illegal party, in 1981 and again after the 1988 October Riots, which brought about the end of the National Liberation Front&#x27;s (FLN) single-party rule. During Algeria&#x27;s civil war of the 1990s, Hanoune was one of the few opposition voices in parliament, and, despite her party&#x27;s laicist values, a strong opponent of the government&#x27;s &quot;eradication&quot; policy toward Islamists. In January 1995, she signed the Sant&#x27;Egidio Platform together with representatives of other opposition parties, notably the Islamic Salvation Front, the radical Islamist party whose dissolution by military decree brought about the start of the civil war.

==Early life==
Hanoune was born in Chekfa, Jijel Province. Her parents were mountain peasants from Chekfa, Jijel Province, and she fled with her family to the city of Annaba, after her parental home was bombed by the French army during the Algerian War (1954–1962). She was the first woman of her family to go to school. With Algeria&#x27;s free and compulsory education system, Hanoune completed secondary school and went on to obtain her bachelor&#x27;s degree before joining the air transport sector. Hanoune studied law at the University of Annaba, a decision which was opposed by her father. She has stated that &quot;It is this right to education which will completely change the position, the representation of women in our society and of which I am partly a product.&quot;

==Workers&#x27; Party==

Following the riots of 1988, Algeria adopted a pluralist system in 1989 which made it possible for Hanoune to establish the Workers&#x27; Party. It was founded in 1990 by writ of the Socialist Workers Organization. Their main platform is concerned with the class struggle between the workers or &quot;exploited classes&quot; and the owners or &quot;oppressors&quot;. It is an independent party which supports the Algerian national movement. Hanoune has been the leader and spokesperson of the party since its inception and was elected Secretary General of the party in October 2005. In 2007, there were 23 parties contesting elections in Algeria.

She is known for denouncing the dissolution of the Islamic Salvation Front, being outspoken in favor of reconciliation, and—along with other parties—signing the Sant&#x27;Egidio platform &quot;for a political solution to the Algerian crisis&quot;. During the period of newly-independent Algeria, Hanoune formed her political ideals: &quot;The whole country was still pulsing from the war of liberation, everybody was talking about socialism, of justice, of progress. Algeria was at the height of its anti-imperialist battle... we were completely united with the Palestinians, their cause was also ours. We were against apartheid in South Africa, we talked about Vietnam, I grew up like all my generation in this militant atmosphere, of struggle.&quot;

==Presidential campaigns==
Hanounes first bid for the 1999 presidential election was rejected by the Constitutional Council.

In the 2004 presidential election she however became the first female candidate in the entire Arab world to run for president. Only six candidates were recognized by the constitutional council.

Hanoune was one of eleven candidates who nominated for the 2009 presidential election. Her platform included defending the principle of national sovereignty and denouncing the policy of liberalization and privatization of public enterprises. She won 4.22% of the vote, coming second out of six candidates, as President Abdelaziz Bouteflika won a third term with 90.24% of the votes cast in an election which was denounced as fraudulent.

In the 2014 presidential election, she finished fourth receiving only 1.37% of the votes. In the party&#x27;s press conference she accepted the defeat and insisted that the elections were carried through in a correct way and this time without any fraud. &quot;Bouteflika has won, people have chosen stability,&quot; she said.

In July 2024, Louisa Hanoune announced the withdrawal of her candidacy and criticized the “unjust conditions” in which the campaign was taking place. accusing the Algerian regime of intending to exclude her and prevent free candidacy without clarifying those details, Hanoune criticized the National Independent Authority for Elections for its failure to manage the signature collection process. She pointed to a lack of technical equipment and intimidation by municipal employees.

==Other activities==
At the international level, Hanoune was a founding member of the International Workers and Peoples in January 1991. She has participated as a representative of PT conferences against privatization and for the defense of trade union organizations and campaigned for workplace standards. She is a committee member of the women workers and of the Africa Committee of the International Workers. She was involved with a coalition of unions that spoke out against the war in Iraq, including the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the International Confederation of Workers (EIT).

In March 2010, Hanoune joined other women&#x27;s-rights activists in calling for repeal of Algeria&#x27;s Family Code on grounds of its failure to provide adequate protection for females.

In February 2011, she criticised a 12 February anti-Bouteflika demonstration in Algiers as social manipulation—&quot;trying to manipulate the social discontent, which is real, to divert it in the service of imperialism&quot;—and prescribed

a clean break with the European Union, the repeal of all the concessions made to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and [a] return to full economic sovereignty.

She noted that the demonstration had been supported by former prime minister and International Monetary Fund/World Bank consultant Ahmed Benbitour. Her editorial message called on &quot;activists, members and supporters to form popular committees ... to establish their demands through free discussion, and [press for] exclusively national, Algerian solutions&quot;.

In September 2019, Hanoune was imprisoned for political reasons by the then-interim Algerian military regime. At the beginning of 2020, after a judicial appeal, her sentence was reduced and she is now free.

<text>Prospero is a relatively small retrograde irregular satellite of Uranus discovered on 18 July 1999 by the astrophysicist Matthew Holman and his team, and given the provisional designation S/1999 U 3. Confirmed as Uranus XVIII it was named after the sorcerer Prospero in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong to the same dynamic cluster as Sycorax and Setebos, suggesting common origin. However, this suggestion does not appear to be supported by the observed colours. The satellite appears neutral (grey) in visible light (colour indices B−V=0.80, R−V=0.39), similar to Setebos but different from Sycorax (which is light red).

<doc id="573165" wikidata="Q26904532" url="?curid=573165" title="Setebos">
<text>Setebos (also Settaboth) was a devil-god of the Tehuelche people of eastern Patagonia. The name was recorded by Europeans traveling with Ferdinand Magellan during the first circumnavigation of the world (1519–1522), and again some 58 years later by Sir Francis Drake during his (1577–1579) circumnavigation voyage. The Tehuelche people no longer constitute a coherent community and their language appears to be extinct; since the name Setebos is not attested in more recent ethnographic studies of eastern Patagonian indigenous peoples,
the reports made during the 16th century appear to be the only documented evidence of a god having this name.

However the name Setebos occurs twice in Shakespeare&#x27;s 1611 play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and scholars generally agree that Shakespeare adopted the name after having read a sixteenth-century English account of Magellan&#x27;s voyage. In the play, Setebos, an unseen character, is described as the god worshiped by the sea-witch Sycorax, the mother of the subhuman Caliban. Many Shakespearean scholars have explicitly connected the character of Setebos in &quot;The Tempest&quot; with the characteristics attributed by the Tehuelche people to their god Setebos.

Largely because of Shakespeare&#x27;s use of the name, &quot;Setebos&quot; has maintained currency in published works, including poems, novels and plays. In some of these (e.g. Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Caliban upon Setebos&quot;) Setebos is understood to be the mythical character mentioned in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, while in others (e.g. Mónica Maffía&#x27;s &quot;Cimbelino en la Patagonia&quot;) Setebos is presented both as a Shakespearean character and as the Tehuelche god.

Setebos&#x27;s physical appearance is described only briefly in the 16th century accounts, and not at all in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and in subsequent works, Setebos has been imagined in a variety of different ways, ranging from nearly human, to a tiger-toad chimera, to a bizarre extraterrestrial creature.

== Setebos in the New World ==

In 1519 the Portuguese sailor Ferdinand Magellan crossed the Atlantic on the first leg of his circumnavigation of the world. Near the southern tip of South America he encountered native people who were described by the Italian who accompanied the expedition, Antonio Pigafetta (1480–1534), as “Patagoni”. Pigafetta&#x27;s manuscript account of the voyage is believed lost, but four other manuscripts from the same time period, one in Italian (known as the &quot;Ambrosian&quot; or &quot;Milan&quot; manuscript) and three in French translation, are extant. The most accurate and complete English translation of Pigafetta&#x27;s report was published by James Alexander Robertson in 1906 based on the Ambrosian manuscript.

The first encounter between the Europeans and the Patagonians took place in May 1520, when the fleet had been anchored for two months at Puerto San Julian. According to Pigafetta, &quot;One day we suddenly saw a naked man of giant stature on the shore of the port, dancing, singing, and throwing dust on his head.&quot; The natives were given gifts and some were invited on board the ships. Two weeks later, four natives appeared and Magellan&#x27;s crew captured two of them by a ruse: loading their arms with presents and then shackling their legs. &quot;When our men were driving home the cross bolt, the two giants began to suspect something, but the captain assuring them, however, they stood still. When they saw later that they were tricked, they raged like bulls, calling loudly for Setebos to aid them&quot;.

Pigafetta also reported on the burial customs of the natives:

When one of those people die, ten or twelve demons all painted appear to them and dance very joyfully about the corpse. They notice that one of those demons is much taller than the others, and he cries out and rejoices more. They paint themselves exactly in the same manner as the demon appears to them painted. They call the larger demon Setebos, and the others Cheleulle. That giant [native] also told us by signs that he had seen the demons with two horns on their heads, and long hair which hung to the feet belching forth fire from mouth and buttocks.

Pigafetta relates that another native, who was brought on board one of the ships, was shown a cross and was terrified. &quot;Once I made the sign of the cross, and, showing it to him, kissed it. He immediately cried out “Setebos,” and made me a sign that if I made the sign of the cross again, Setebos would enter into my body and cause it to burst. When that giant was sick, he asked for the cross, and embracing it and kissing it many times, desired to become a Christian before his death&quot;.

The Patagonian&#x27;s god is also mentioned (this time spelled &quot;Settaboth&quot; and also &quot;Settaboh&quot;) in a separate account of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s voyage of circumnavigation (1577–1580), a half-century after Magellan&#x27;s. Drake followed a similar route to Magellan&#x27;s along South America&#x27;s eastern coast, and laid anchor at Puerto Deseado (121 nautical miles north of Puerto San Julián) for two weeks in May–June 1578. Here the sailors made their first acquaintance with the Patagonians. An encounter is described in a journal
kept by Francis Fletcher (c. 1555 – c. 1619), a priest of the Church of England who accompanied Drake on his voyage. According to Fletcher, the English attempted to trade some trinkets, but the natives were cautious and retreated. &quot;They would have non of our company&quot; wrote Fletcher, &quot;till such tyme they were warranted by oracle from their god Settaboth, that is, the Divell, whom they name their great god&quot;. The natives then sent one of their own, a &quot;priest or prophet&quot;, to confer with Settaboth:

[the prophet] departed for the tyme from them into som secret place under the side of the hill, where Settaboh appeared unto him to give him his oracle to bring unto them, that they might know what they should doe, that is, whether they should be acquainted with us or noe. Now when the prophet came to them againe he seemed to be changed in shape, for even as Settaboh appeared vnto him, he in shew and outward apearance came to them, haveing on his head before, standing upright, little hornes, and two long and broad black feathers ... but in a long tyme they would not receave annything out of our hands, except we cast it downe upon the ground.
The journals of Pigafetta (Magellan) and Fletcher (Drake) were not published immediately after voyage&#x27;s end.
Pigafetta returned to Europe in 1522, where he presented a number of kings and queens with extracts from his narrative of Magellan&#x27;s voyage, and from the Seignory of Venice he obtained permission to publish it, but he never did. The first published version of Pigafetta&#x27;s journal was an Italian translation of a French translation of the lost Italian original. That Italian translation was itself translated into English in abbreviated form by Richard Eden in his &quot;The Decades of the New Worlde&quot;, published in London in 1555, and then posthumously reprinted in an augmented version in 1577. It is the 1577 Eden version where Shakespeare is most likely to have come across the name Setebos.

Francis Fletcher&#x27;s account of Drake&#x27;s voyage of circumnavigation, which also discussed an encounter with the native Patagonians, was not published until 1628, after Shakespeare&#x27;s death. However textual evidence suggests that Shakespeare may have been familiar with Fletcher&#x27;s (yet unpublished) account, as discussed in the next section.

== Shakespeare and Setebos ==

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, which was first performed on 1 November 1611, the character Caliban twice mentions a god Setebos. The first instance occurs near the play&#x27;s beginning. Caliban is responding to a threat from Prospero, who asks Caliban if he is refusing a command to fetch wood. In an aside to the audience, Caliban says (Act I, Scene II, Line 374):

No, &#x27;pray thee.
I must obey. His Art is of such pow&#x27;r,
It would controll my Dams god &quot;Setebos&quot;,
And make a vassaile of him. 

Caliban&#x27;s &quot;Dam&quot; (mother) is the evil witch Sycorax.
The second instance is near the play&#x27;s end. Ariel has lured Caliban and two co-conspirators, Antonio and Sebastian, to Prospero&#x27;s cell, where spirits in the shape of dogs have been set to snarling at them. Caliban addresses Setebos (Act V, Scene I, Line 261):

O &quot;Setebos&quot;, these be brave spirits indeede!
How fine my Master is! I am afraid
He will chastise me.
There is no documented proof that Shakespeare was familiar with the accounts by Pigafetta or Fletcher of the New World, or that he knew about the Tehuelche god Setebos. However it is widely accepted, by literary scholars and historians, that Shakespeare was familiar with those accounts, and that he chose the name Setebos for the god of Caliban and Sycorax based on them.

One argument is based on the notoriety, in the 16th century, of Magellan&#x27;s and Drake&#x27;s voyages:

Whether or not Shakespeare read [Pigafetta&#x27;s] or any other account of Magellan’s voyage, these were
the sorts of terms, names, and incidents that were being bruited about.
Magellan&#x27;s voyage was discussed as polar or lunar expeditions have been in modern times. We need to read the voyage literature, therefore, not necessarily to find out what Shakespeare read, but to ascertain what Shakespeare and his audience together would have been likely to know—what they would have gathered from a variety of sources.
But probably more persuasive is the work by Shakespearean scholars Frank Kermode, Geoffrey Bullough, Hallett Smith and others who have traced textual connections between New World materials and &quot;The Tempest&quot;. For instance: In the French and Italian accounts of Magellan&#x27;s voyage that preceded Eden&#x27;s, two of the mutineers against Magellan were named Antonio and Sebastian, and Magellan was said to have put the mutiny down with the help of one Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa. In the play, for comparison, two characters also named Antonio and Sebastian conspire to kill king Alonso, and an advisor named Gonzalo; Prospero and Ariel thwart the conspiracy.

In the case of Francis Fletcher&#x27;s account of Drake&#x27;s voyage, which was not published until after Shakespeare&#x27;s death, some of the resemblances to happenings in &quot;The Tempest&quot; are striking, suggesting that Shakespeare was familiar with Fletcher&#x27;s unpublished narrative. For example the description in the play of Alonso and his party coming upon the banquet prepared by the &quot;several strange Shapes&quot; parallels the description in Fletcher of the first meeting between Drake&#x27;s men and the Patagonians. In the words of Hallett Smith: &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s imagination, at the time he wrote The Tempest, would appear to have been stimulated by the accounts of travel and exploration in the new world&quot;.

Many Shakespeare scholars have explicitly connected Setebos of &quot;The Tempest&quot; with the Patagonian Setebos. For instance, John Lee writes:

In his comprehensive generalisation Shakespeare ascribes to Caliban some vague affinities with the most barbarous of all the American races. ... [Sir Francis] Drake echoes reports by earlier Spanish travellers of the savage worship, which the Patagonians offered their &#x27;great devil Setebos.&#x27; Of this Patagonian deity Caliban twice makes mention, calling him &#x27;my dam&#x27;s god, Setebos&#x27; (I. ii. 373; V. i. 261). Despite his dissimilarity from the Patagonians in all other respects, he avows himself a votary of their &#x27;great devil&#x27;.
And John Gillies writes &quot;Caliban&#x27;s description of Setebos as &#x27;my dam&#x27;s god&#x27; (1.2.376) is fully consistent with Pigafetta&#x27;s account of Setebos as a devil, in view of Prospero&#x27;s repeated references to Caliban as a devil&quot;:

The name &#x27;Setebos&#x27; is more than just a random echo of the voyage narratives. By worshipping the god which Antonio Pigafetta describes as being worshipped by the Patagonian Indians of the storm-beaten wilderness of Tierra del Fuego, Sycorax is identified with the most remote, God-forsaken and degenerate of sixteenth-century Amerindian types.
... If Prospero is to be believed, Sycorax has had intercourse with &#x27;the devil himself&#x27;, resulting in Caliban, &#x27;the son that she did litter here&#x27;.
== Post-Shakespearean representations of Setebos ==

=== In poetry ===
====&quot;Caliban Upon Setebos&quot;====

Robert Browning&#x27;s poem, published in 1864, has as second title &quot;Natural Theology in the Island&quot;.
J. Cotter Morison gave what is now a standard interpretation of Browning&#x27;s title: &quot;the writer&#x27;s intention ... is to describe in a dramatic monologue the Natural Theology,that is, the conception of God,likely, or rather certain to occur to such a being as Caliban.&quot; Caliban&#x27;s god is, of course, Setebos, and the poem can be seen as an analysis of the thought processes of Caliban as he tries to understand the nature of his god. Browning uses Caliban (or so it is widely argued) to demonstrate the errors of constructing God in the image of ourselves, and perhaps also as a rhetorical vehicle to attack established religions, in particular, Calvinism.

Shakespeare&#x27;s Caliban is a primitive version of a man, and Caliban conceives of his god as a primitive man might, based on his experience with the natural world.
Much of the poem is concerned with Caliban&#x27;s fantasy of himself as a god, and the analogies he draws between his own imagined behavior and that of Setebos. Caliban imagines, for instance, crabs walking from the mountains to the sea, and says he will

Let twenty pass, and stone the twenty-first,
Loving not, hating not, just choosing so. 

He concludes &quot;As it likes me each time, I do: so He&quot; [i.e. Setebos]. Caliban reasons that Setebos is a being who derives vicarious satisfaction from creating creatures who (unlike Setebos) are capable of physical reproduction, and then expresses his jealously by committing capricious acts of spite and vengeance on those creatures. Setebos inspires fear and loathing in Caliban with few consolations: Caliban anticipates no afterlife nor 
is he optimistic about relief from suffering in this one. Although he imagines a second god above Setebos, which he calls &quot;The Quiet&quot;, Caliban can&#x27;t imagine either of these gods as working in his favor. Setebos, Caliban imagines, &quot;Looks up, first, and perceives he cannot soar / To what is quiet and hath happy life; / Next looks down here, and out of very spite /
Makes this a bauble-world to ape yon real&quot;.

Browning twice mentions, as a physical attribute of Setebos, his multiple hands:

&#x27;Careth but for Setebos
The many-handed as a cuttle-fish, 

and

Also it pleaseth Setebos to work, 
Use all His hands, and exercise much craft, 
By no means for the love of what is worked. 

although it is possible that Caliban is meant to be speaking metaphorically here.

=== In theater ===

====&quot;Caliban by the Yellow Sands&quot;====

To commemorate the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare&#x27;s death in 1916, New York City commissioned Percy MacKaye to create a theatrical experience for the community based on Shakespeare&#x27;s work. The result, &quot;Caliban by the Yellow Sands&quot;, required about 30 professional actors for the speaking roles and about 2500 mute participants for the pantomimes.

MacKaye described the opening scene: 

The scene is the cave of SETEBOS, whose stark-colored idol — half tiger and half toad — colossal and primitive — rises at centre above a stone altar.

On the right, the cave leads inward to the abode of SYCORAX; on the left, it leads outward to the sea, a blue-green glimpse of which is vaguely visible.

High in the tiger-jaws of the idol, ARIEL — a slim, winged figure, half nude — is held fettered.

Miranda discovers the imprisoned Ariel; Prospero releases Ariel and his spirits, and together with Prospero they convert Setebos&#x27;s cave into a theater and perform a pageant consisting of scenes from Shakespeare. The dramatic tension consists of a struggle for Caliban&#x27;s soul, between the forces of darkness, represented by Setebos and his &quot;priests&quot; Lust, War and Death, and the forces of light, i.e. Prospero, Ariel and Miranda.
Judging from the program of the second (Boston) set of performances in 1917, as well as other contemporary accounts,
 the role of Setebos was not a speaking one and Setebos was not portrayed via an actor. Rather, the &quot;middle stage&quot; (where the characters of &quot;The Tempest&quot; interacted) was dominated by a two-headed idol, &quot;half tiger, half toad,&quot; representing Setebos. The frontispiece of MacKaye&#x27;s &quot;Program&quot;, shown here in Figure 2, displays an image of Setebos created by Joseph Urban for the New York performances; the caption is &quot;The Cave of Setebos.&quot;

====&quot;Cimbelino en la Patagonia&quot;====

Mónica Maffía&#x27;s play was written for a 2022 performance by her Buenos Aires based theater company, &quot;Setebos&quot;. It is described as &quot;an eco-drama based on Shakespeare&#x27;s Cymbeline, set within the Tehuelche myth of the god/hero Setebos.&quot; The play was commissioned in connection with the &quot;Cymbeline in the Anthropocene&quot; project, described as &quot;an international research-in-performance project which brings together seven theatre companies and environmentally committed productions from four continents.&quot; The play was performed as part of the &quot;Cymbeline in the Anthropocene&quot; Festival.

In a 2022 interview with the CBC, Maffía said

there’s a connexion through Caliban, which is where this adaptation of Cymbeline comes from for me, because Caliban prays to his god, which is Setebos. Researching who Setebos was, I found that [out] in Pigafetta’s chronicles of Magellan and the first [circum]navigation; and through those chronicles we learn that when [the Spanish] met the Tehuelches, [the latter] were very tall. And that in their funeral rites, they said that Setebos appeared, and with smaller “devils.” So Setebos is both a hero and a god-devil figure.

In a separate interview in 2022, 
Maffía elaborated: Setebos, she said, was also

the father of people who were the ancestral people of Patagonia who were Tehuelche, and in their tradition, animals are people. We know about that god, not usually through a connection with our myths, but through Shakespeare ... None of those who were my group of actors knew even the name Setebos. They immediately got philosophical about it. They turned down their voices and their souls began to speak. So I thought that’s an opportunity for me as a director and as a playwright to get people to know about these folktales that were traditional before Shakespeare.
The action begins with actors arriving at a cabaña in El Chaltén, a small mountain village in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina that is supposedly the birthplace of the Tehuelche fire-god Setebos, creator of the region&#x27;s people and wildlife. The actors gradually fall under the spell of the mountain. As the play progresses, each actor plays characters representing three states of being: contemporary Argentinian, Shakespearian, and Tehuelche human-animal. The lines between these states become blurred, until finally the characters metamorphose into avatars of the Setebos myth. Unlike in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, the actors repeatedly invoke Setebos by name; for instance, the character Ínogen&#x27;s touching “¡Setebos, me encomiendo a tu protección!” / “Setebos, I commend myself to your protection” before she goes to sleep. Near the end of the play, the story of the birth of Setebos and the Tehuelche people is presented by the spiritually reborn actors wearing animal masks.

=== In literature ===
====&quot;Ilium/Olympos&quot;====

An extraterrestrial creature called Setebos plays an important role in Dan Simmons&#x27; science-fiction novels &quot;Ilium&quot; and &quot;Olympos&quot;. The two novels, which comprise a series, also contain characters named Prospero, Ariel and Caliban who are clearly based on the eponymous characters in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and there is little doubt that the author patterned his Setebos after the god mentioned in that play as well. Simmons&#x27;s Setebos also calls to mind Browning&#x27;s description in his &quot;Caliban upon Setebos&quot; in that Simmons describes Setebos as having myriad arms; however unlike Browning&#x27;s Setebos, who is infertile, Simmons&#x27;s character is highly fecund.

Simmons gives the following description of Setebos, as seen through the eyes of a human named Daeman. The creature sits over a crater at the center of a blue, ice-cold dome:

This raised crater looked very much like a nest and the impression was reinforced by the thing that filled itgray brain tissue, convoluted ridges, multiple pairs of eyes, mouths, and orifices opening and shutting in no unison, a score of huge hands beneath itthese hands occasionally rearranging the huge form&#x27;s mass on its nest, settling it more comfortablyand he saw other hands, each larger than the room Daeman occuped at Ardis Hall, that had emerged from the brain on stalks and were pulling themselves and their trailing tentacles across the glowing floor.

Daeman counts several dozen eggs around Setebos. He steals one; it eventually hatches, into a miniature, and very malevolent, version of its parent.

<doc id="573168" wikidata="Q3656937" url="?curid=573168" title="Captain Nice">
<text>Captain Nice is an American comedy television series that ran from January 9, 1967 to August 28, 1967, Monday nights at 8:30 pm EST on NBC, opposite ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Rat Patrol&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. The show was an unsuccessful attempt to cash in on the 1966 smash hit ABC TV version of &quot;Batman&quot;. A similar series on CBS, &quot;Mr. Terrific,&quot; also aired on Monday nights that season in the 8 pm EST time slot.

A single-issue comic book adaptation was published by Gold Key Comics in November 1967. Reruns of &quot;Captain Nice&quot; aired on Ha! (Comedy Central) in 1991.

== Plot ==
Riding the tide of the camp superhero craze of the 1960s, the show&#x27;s premise involved police chemist Carter Nash (William Daniels), a mild-mannered mama&#x27;s boy who discovered a secret formula that, when he drank it, transformed him in an explosive burst of smoke into Captain Nice.
Nash called himself &quot;Captain Nice&quot; in his first appearance when a bystander asked him who he was: his belt buckle was monogrammed &quot;CN,&quot; and Nash later admitted, &quot;It was all I could think of!&quot; On that occasion the explosion that transformed him blew off most of his clothes, leaving him in long underwear and with the remnants of his shirt suggesting a cape.

Captain Nice didn&#x27;t behave much differently from Carter. His costume consisted of white pajamas adorned with gold stars, red stripes on the pants, the words &quot;Captain Nice&quot; (initially misspelled &quot;Captin&quot; until a smaller &#x27;A&#x27; was added) in blue across the chest, a red-white-and-blue belt with a gold buckle, and an over-sized red and blue cape, all lovingly sewn by his domineering mother who had basically cajoled Nash into his crime-fighting career. In some episodes he wore his regular glasses as Captain Nice, but in others he wore a domino mask, but still wore his glasses over the mask. Despite the kitschy garb, the very sight of Captain Nice somehow struck fear into the hearts of criminals.

His superpowers included superhuman strength, invulnerability, and the ability to fly, although Nash had a great fear of heights, and his natural clumsiness increased whenever he drank his super serum.
Carter had a would-be girlfriend in the police department, meter maid Sergeant Candy Kane, although he seemed mostly oblivious to her obvious attentions.

==Cast==
*William Daniels as Captain Nice / Carter Nash
*Alice Ghostley as Mrs. Nash
*Ann Prentiss as Sergeant Candy Kane
*Liam Dunn as Mayor Finney 
*Byron Foulger as Mr. Nash

== Production ==
The series was created by Buck Henry, who was a co-creator of the hit series &quot;Get Smart&quot;. The show&#x27;s premise is similar to that of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Mister Terrific&quot;, which preceded &quot;Captain Nice&quot; on Monday nights. 
Ann Prentiss, younger sister of actress Paula and sister-in-law of actor Richard Benjamin, played Candy.

Alice Ghostley (who was only three years Daniels&#x27; senior) played Carter&#x27;s mother. She later won fame as the witch Esmerelda on &quot;Bewitched&quot;, and as neighbor Bernice on the comedy &quot;Designing Women&quot;.

Carter&#x27;s father, whose face was never seen, was portrayed by one of the films&#x27; most prolific character actors, Byron Foulger. In a reverse of Foulger&#x27;s and familiarity in films, his appearances in this series generally found him hidden behind a newspaper and not making a sound.

==Episode list==
==Home media==
&quot;Captain Nice&quot; was released in Germany by Pidax film media Ltd (AL! VE) on Region 2 DVD on August 5, 2011 under the title &quot;Das Geheimnis der blauen Tropfen - Die komplette Serie&quot; [The Secret of the Blue Drops - The Complete Series]. Audio is German language only, with no English language option. Episodes are reportedly heavily edited with some only running 14 minutes in length per episode.

<text>Strawberry Hill is an area of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames in Twickenham. It is a suburban development situated 10.4 miles (16.7 km) west south-west of Charing Cross. It consists of a number of residential roads centred on a small development of shops, including a pharmacy, post office, off licence, hairdressing salon and grocery store. Residents are served by Strawberry Hill railway station, where trains run to London Waterloo from both platforms – via Kingston and Richmond respectively.

The area&#x27;s ACORN demographic type is characterised as well-off professionals, larger houses, and converted flats. St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham, the country&#x27;s oldest Roman Catholic University, is situated on Waldegrave Road. Its sports grounds were used as a training site for the 2012 Olympics.

The folk-rock band the Strawbs were originally called the Strawberry Hill Boys. The founding members were students at St. Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham, then St. Mary&#x27;s Teacher Training College, Strawberry Hill and, because they were in their initial incarnation playing bluegrass, thought it apt to have &#x27;hill&#x27; in the band name.

== Strawberry Hill House &amp; Garden==
The eighteenth-century development is named after &quot;Strawberry Hill&quot;, the fanciful Gothic Revival villa designed by author Horace Walpole between 1749 and 1776. It began as a small 17th century house &quot;little more than a cottage&quot;, with only of land and ended up as a &quot;little Gothic castle&quot; in . The original owner had named the house &quot;Chopped Straw Hall&quot;, but Walpole wanted it to be called something more distinctive and after finding an old lease that described his land as &quot;Strawberry Hill Shot&quot;, he adopted this name.

After a £9 million, two year restoration, Strawberry Hill House re-opened to the public in October 2010. It housed famous eighteenth-century literary figures such as Alexander Pope and Horace Walpole.

<doc id="573172" wikidata="Q2630219" url="?curid=573172" title="Boston-class cruiser">
<text>The United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;Boston&quot; class were the first guided missile cruisers in the world. Both ships in this experimental class were originally heavy cruisers that had been decommissioned after World War II, but were redesignated as guided missile heavy cruisers (CAGs) and entered refit in 1952. The lengthy conversion and modernization project (aka SCB 48) involved replacing the aft triple 8-inch gun turret and its supporting structure with two twin launchers for Terrier anti-aircraft guided missiles. The forward two 8-inch gun turrets remained unchanged. The forward superstructure was modified to include the Terrier&#x27;s associated radars and electronics, the aft superstructure was completely replaced, and the &quot;Baltimore&quot; class&#x27;s two funnels were trunked to one.

Owing to the &quot;Boston&quot; class&#x27;s experimental nature, the ships were only partially converted, with a full conversion to be carried out if the new weapon systems were successful. Had the ships been fully converted, the forward 8-inch turrets would have been replaced with additional Terrier launchers.

In 1968 both &quot;Boston&quot;-class guided missile heavy cruisers were reclassified back to heavy cruisers (CAs), in part due to the extensive use of their 8-inch guns for shore bombardment during the Vietnam War. While they had retained their Terrier missiles, the swift advance of technology had made these pioneering weapons obsolete after little more than a dozen years&#x27; service, and the ships&#x27; main battery was once again their six remaining 8-inch guns in the forward turrets.

Various proposals for limited modernization or complete reconstruction (including SCB 003.68) were considered but ultimately rejected. In 1970 both &quot;Boston&quot; class ships were decommissioned for the final time, eventually struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and sold for scrap.

<text>Interior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing environment for the people using the space. With a keen eye for detail and a creative flair, an interior designer is someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such enhancement projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, site inspections, programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and execution of the design.

==History and current terms==

In the past, interiors were put together instinctively as a part of the process of building.

The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the development of society and the complex architecture that has resulted from the development of industrial processes.

The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior design profession. The profession of interior design is separate and distinct from the role of &quot;interior decorator&quot;, a term commonly used in the US; the term is less common in the UK, where the profession of interior design is still unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking, not yet officially a profession.

In ancient India, architects would also function as interior designers. This can be seen from the references of Vishwakarma the architect—one of the gods in Indian mythology. In these architects&#x27; design of 17th-century Indian homes, sculptures depicting ancient texts and events are seen inside the palaces, while during the medieval times wall art paintings were a common feature of palace-like mansions in India commonly known as havelis. While most traditional homes have been demolished to make way to modern buildings, there are still around 2000 havelis in the Shekhawati region of Rajashtan that display wall art paintings.

In ancient Egypt, &quot;soul houses&quot; (or models of houses) were placed in tombs as receptacles for food offerings. From these, it is possible to discern details about the interior design of different residences throughout the different Egyptian dynasties, such as changes in ventilation, porticoes, columns, loggias, windows, and doors.
Painting interior walls has existed for at least 5,000 years, with examples found as far north as the Ness of Brodgar, as have templated interiors, as seen in the associated Skara Brae settlement. It was the Greeks, and later Romans who added co-ordinated, decorative mosaics floors, and templated bath houses, shops, civil offices, Castra (forts) and temple, interiors, in the first millennia BC. With specialised guilds dedicated to producing interior decoration, and formulaic furniture, in buildings constructed to forms defined by Roman architects, such as Vitruvius: De architectura, libri decem (The Ten Books on Architecture).

Throughout the 17th and 18th century and into the early 19th century, interior decoration was the concern of the homemaker, or an employed upholsterer or craftsman who would advise on the artistic style for an interior space. Architects would also employ craftsmen or artisans to complete interior design for their buildings.

===Commercial interior design and management===
In the mid-to-late 19th century, interior design services expanded greatly, as the middle class in industrial countries grew in size and prosperity and began to desire the domestic trappings of wealth to cement their new status. Large furniture firms began to branch out into general interior design and management, offering full house furnishings in a variety of styles. This business model flourished from the mid-century to 1914, when this role was increasingly usurped by independent, often amateur, designers. This paved the way for the emergence of the professional interior design in the mid-20th century.
In the 1950s and 1960s, upholsterers began to expand their business remits. They framed their business more broadly and in artistic terms and began to advertise their furnishings to the public. To meet the growing demand for contract interior work on projects such as offices, hotels, and public buildings, these businesses became much larger and more complex, employing builders, joiners, plasterers, textile designers, artists, and furniture designers, as well as engineers and technicians to fulfil the job. Firms began to publish and circulate catalogs with prints for different lavish styles to attract the attention of expanding middle classes.

As department stores increased in number and size, retail spaces within shops were furnished in different styles as examples for customers. One particularly effective advertising tool was to set up model rooms at national and international exhibitions in showrooms for the public to see. Some of the pioneering firms in this regard were Waring &amp; Gillow, James Shoolbred, Mintons, and Holland &amp; Sons. These traditional high-quality furniture making firms began to play an important role as advisers to unsure middle class customers on taste and style, and began taking out contracts to design and furnish the interiors of many important buildings in Britain.

This type of firm emerged in America after the Civil War. The Herter Brothers, founded by two German émigré brothers, began as an upholstery warehouse and became one of the first firms of furniture makers and interior decorators. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers were prepared to accomplish every aspect of interior furnishing including decorative paneling and mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors, and carpets and draperies.
A pivotal figure in popularizing theories of interior design to the middle class was the architect Owen Jones, one of the most influential design theorists of the nineteenth century. Jones&#x27; first project was his most important—in 1851, he was responsible for not only the decoration of Joseph Paxton&#x27;s gigantic Crystal Palace for the Great Exhibition but also the arrangement of the exhibits within. He chose a controversial palette of red, yellow, and blue for the interior ironwork and, despite initial negative publicity in the newspapers, was eventually unveiled by Queen Victoria to much critical acclaim. His most significant publication was &quot;The Grammar of Ornament&quot; (1856), in which Jones formulated 37 key principles of interior design and decoration.

Jones was employed by some of the leading interior design firms of the day; in the 1860s, he worked in collaboration with the London firm Jackson &amp; Graham to produce furniture and other fittings for high-profile clients including art collector Alfred Morrison as well as Ismail Pasha, Khedive of Egypt.

In 1882, the London Directory of the Post Office listed 80 interior decorators. Some of the most distinguished companies of the period were Crace, Waring &amp; Gillowm and Holland &amp; Sons; famous decorators employed by these firms included Thomas Edward Collcutt, Edward William Godwin, Charles Barry, Gottfried Semper, and George Edmund Street.

===Transition to professional interior design===

By the turn of the 20th century, amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the monopoly that the large retail companies had on interior design. English feminist author Mary Haweis wrote a series of widely read essays in the 1880s in which she derided the eagerness with which aspiring middle-class people furnished their houses according to the rigid models offered to them by the retailers. She advocated the individual adoption of a particular style, tailor-made to the individual needs and preferences of the customer:One of my strongest convictions, and one of the first canons of good taste, is that our houses, like the fish&#x27;s shell and the bird&#x27;s nest, ought to represent our individual taste and habits.

The move toward decoration as a separate artistic profession, unrelated to the manufacturers and retailers, received an impetus with the 1899 formation of the Institute of British Decorators; with John Dibblee Crace as its president, it represented almost 200 decorators around the country. By 1915, the London Directory listed 127 individuals trading as interior decorators, of which 10 were women. Rhoda Garrett and Agnes Garrett were the first women to train professionally as home decorators in 1874. The importance of their work on design was regarded at the time as on a par with that of William Morris. In 1876, their work – &quot;Suggestions for House Decoration in Painting, Woodwork and Furniture&quot; – spread their ideas on artistic interior design to a wide middle-class audience.

By 1900, the situation was described by &quot;The Illustrated Carpenter and Builder&quot;:Until recently when a man wanted to furnish he would visit all the dealers and select piece by piece of furniture ...Today he sends for a dealer in art furnishings and fittings who surveys all the rooms in the house and he brings his artistic mind to bear on the subject.In America, Candace Wheeler was one of the first woman interior designers and helped encourage a new style of American design. She was instrumental in the development of art courses for women in a number of major American cities and was considered a national authority on home design. An important influence on the new profession was &quot;The Decoration of Houses&quot;, a manual of interior design written by Edith Wharton with architect Ogden Codman in 1897 in America. In the book, the authors denounced Victorian-style interior decoration and interior design, especially those rooms that were decorated with heavy window curtains, Victorian bric-a-brac, and overstuffed furniture. They argued that such rooms emphasized upholstery at the expense of proper space planning and architectural design and were, therefore, uncomfortable and rarely used. The book is considered a seminal work, and its success led to the emergence of professional decorators working in the manner advocated by its authors, most notably Elsie de Wolfe.
Elsie De Wolfe was one of the first interior designers. Rejecting the Victorian style she grew up with, she chose a more vibrant scheme, along with more comfortable furniture in the home. Her designs were light, with fresh colors and delicate Chinoiserie furnishings, as opposed to the Victorian preference of heavy, red drapes and upholstery, dark wood and intensely patterned wallpapers. Her designs were also more practical; she eliminated the clutter that occupied the Victorian home, enabling people to entertain more guests comfortably. In 1905, de Wolfe was commissioned for the interior design of the Colony Club on Madison Avenue; its interiors garnered her recognition almost over night. She compiled her ideas into her widely read 1913 book, &quot;The House in Good Taste&quot;.

In England, Syrie Maugham became a legendary interior designer credited with designing the first all-white room. Starting her career in the early 1910s, her international reputation soon grew; she later expanded her business to New York City and Chicago. Born during the Victorian Era, a time characterized by dark colors and small spaces, she instead designed rooms filled with light and furnished in multiple shades of white and mirrored screens. In addition to mirrored screens, her trademark pieces included: books covered in white vellum, cutlery with white porcelain handles, console tables with plaster palm-frond, shell, or dolphin bases, upholstered and fringed sleigh beds, fur carpets, dining chairs covered in white leather, and lamps of graduated glass balls, and wreaths.

===Expansion===
The interior design profession became more established after World War II. From the 1950s onwards, spending on the home increased. Interior design courses were established, requiring the publication of textbooks and reference sources. Historical accounts of interior designers and firms distinct from the decorative arts specialists were made available. Organisations to regulate education, qualifications, standards and practices, etc. were established for the profession.

Interior design was previously seen as playing a secondary role to architecture. It also has many connections to other design disciplines, involving the work of architects, industrial designers, engineers, builders, craftsmen, etc. For these reasons, the government of interior design standards and qualifications was often incorporated into other professional organisations that involved design. Organisations such as the Chartered Society of Designers, established in the UK in 1986, and the American Designers Institute, founded in 1938, governed various areas of design.

It was not until later that specific representation for the interior design profession was developed. The US National Society of Interior Designers was established in 1957, while in the UK the Interior Decorators and Designers Association was established in 1966. Across Europe, other organisations such as The Finnish Association of Interior Architects (1949) were being established and in 1994 the International Interior Design Association was founded.

Ellen Mazur Thomson, author of &quot;Origins of Graphic Design in America&quot; (1997), determined that professional status is achieved through education, self-imposed standards and professional gate-keeping organizations. Having achieved this, interior design became an accepted profession.

==Interior decorators and interior designers==

Interior design is the art and science of understanding people&#x27;s behavior to create functional spaces, that are aesthetically pleasing, within a building. Decoration is the furnishing or adorning of a space with decorative elements, sometimes complemented by advice and practical assistance. In short, interior designers may decorate, but decorators do not design.

===Interior designer===
Interior designer implies that there is more of an emphasis on planning, functional design and the effective use of space, as compared to interior decorating. An interior designer in fine line design can undertake projects that include arranging the basic layout of spaces within a building as well as projects that require an understanding of technical issues such as window and door positioning, acoustics, and lighting. Although an interior designer may create the layout of a space, they may not alter load-bearing walls without having their designs stamped for approval by a structural engineer. Interior designers often work directly with architects, engineers and contractors.

Interior designers must be highly skilled in order to create interior environments that are functional, safe, and adhere to building codes, regulations and ADA requirements. They go beyond the selection of color palettes and furnishings and apply their knowledge to the development of construction documents, occupancy loads, healthcare regulations and sustainable design principles, as well as the management and coordination of professional services including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and life safety—all to ensure that people can live, learn or work in an innocuous environment that is also aesthetically pleasing.

Someone may wish to specialize and develop technical knowledge specific to one area or type of interior design, such as residential design, commercial design, hospitality design, healthcare design, universal design, exhibition design, furniture design, and spatial branding. 
Interior design is a creative profession that is relatively new, constantly evolving, and often confusing to the public. It is not always an artistic pursuit and can rely on research from many fields to provide a well-trained understanding of how people are often influenced by their environments.

=== Color in interior design ===

Color is a powerful design tool in decoration, as well as in interior design, which is the art of composing and coordinating colors together to create a stylish scheme on the interior architecture of the space.

It can be important to interior designers to acquire a deep experience with colors, understand their psychological effects, and understand the meaning of each color in different locations and situations in order to create suitable combinations for each place.

Combining colors together could result in creating a state of mind as seen by the observer, and could eventually result in positive or negative effects on them. Colors can make the room feel either more calm, cheerful, comfortable, stressful, or dramatic. Color combinations can make a tiny room seem larger or smaller. So it is for the Interior designer to choose appropriate colors for a place towards achieving how clients would want to look at, and feel in, that space.

In 2024, red-colored home accessories were popularized on social media and in several design magazines for claiming to enhance interior design. This was coined the Unexpected Red Theory.

==Specialties==
===Residential===
Residential design is the design of the interior of private residences. As this type of design is specific for individual situations, the needs and wants of the individual are paramount in this area of interior design. The interior designer may work on the project from the initial planning stage or may work on the remodeling of an existing structure. It is often a process that takes months to fine-tune and create a space with the vision of the client.

===Commercial===
Commercial design encompasses a wide range of subspecialties.
* Retail: includes malls and shopping centers, department stores, specialty stores, visual merchandising, and showrooms.
* Visual and spatial branding: The use of space as a medium to express a corporate brand.
* Corporate: office design for any kind of business such as banks.
* Healthcare: the design of hospitals, assisted living facilities, medical offices, dentist offices, psychiatric facilities, laboratories, medical specialist facilities.
* Hospitality and recreation: includes hotels, motels, resorts, cruise ships, cafes, bars, casinos, nightclubs, theaters, music and concert halls, opera houses, sports venues, restaurants, gyms, health clubs and spas, etc.
* Institutional: government offices, financial institutions (banks and credit unions), schools and universities, religious facilities, etc.
* Industrial facilities: manufacturing and training facilities as well as import and export facilities.
* Exhibition: includes museums, gallery, exhibition hall, specially the design for showroom and exhibition gallery.
* Traffic building: includes bus station, subway station, airports, pier, etc.
* Sports: includes gyms, stadiums, swimming rooms, basketball halls, etc.
* Teaching in a private institute that offer classes of interior design.
* Self-employment.
* Employment in private sector firms.

===Other===
Other areas of specialization include amusement and theme park design, museum and exhibition design, exhibit design, event design (including ceremonies, weddings, baby and bridal showers, parties, conventions, and concerts), interior and prop styling, craft styling, food styling, product styling, tablescape design, theatre and performance design, stage and set design, scenic design, and production design for film and television. Beyond those, interior designers, particularly those with graduate education, can specialize in healthcare design, gerontological design, educational facility design, and other areas that require specialized knowledge. Some university programs offer graduate studies in theses and other areas. For example, both Cornell University and the University of Florida offer interior design graduate programs in environment and behavior studies.

==Profession==
===Education===

There are various paths that one can take to become a professional interior designer. All of these paths involve some form of training. Working with a successful professional designer is an informal method of training and has previously been the most common method of education. In many states, however, this path alone cannot lead to licensing as a professional interior designer. Training through an institution such as a college, art or design school or university is a more formal route to professional practice.

In many countries, several university degree courses are now available, including those on interior architecture, taking three or four years to complete.

A formal education program, particularly one accredited by or developed with a professional organization of interior designers, can provide training that meets a minimum standard of excellence and therefore gives a student an education of a high standard. There are also university graduate and Ph.D. programs available for those seeking further training in a specific design specialization (i.e. gerontological or healthcare design) or those wishing to teach interior design at the university level.

===Working conditions===
There are a wide range of working conditions and employment opportunities within interior design. Large and tiny corporations often hire interior designers as employees on regular working hours. Designers for smaller firms and online renovation platforms usually work on a contract or per-job basis. Self-employed designers, who made up 32% of interior designers in 2020, usually work the most hours. Interior designers often work under stress to meet deadlines, stay on budget, and meet clients&#x27; needs and wishes.

In some cases, licensed professionals review the work and sign it before submitting the design for approval by clients or construction permitting. The need for licensed review and signature varies by locality, relevant legislation, and scope of work. Their work can involve significant travel to visit different locations. However, with technology development, the process of contacting clients and communicating design alternatives has become easier and requires less travel.

==Styles==

===Art Deco===

The Art Deco style began in Europe in the early years of the 20th century, with the waning of Art Nouveau. The term &quot;Art Deco&quot; was taken from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, a world&#x27;s fair held in Paris in 1925. Art Deco rejected many traditional classical influences in favour of more streamlined geometric forms and metallic color. The Art Deco style influenced all areas of design, especially interior design, because it was the first style of interior decoration to spotlight new technologies and materials.

Art Deco style is mainly based on geometric shapes, streamlining, and clean lines. The style offered a sharp, cool look of mechanized living utterly at odds with anything that came before.

Art Deco rejected traditional materials of decoration and interior design, opting instead to use more unusual materials such as chrome, glass, stainless steel, shiny fabrics, mirrors, aluminium, lacquer, inlaid wood, sharkskin, and zebra skin. The use of harder, metallic materials was chosen to celebrate the machine age. These materials reflected the dawning modern age that was ushered in after the end of the First World War. The innovative combinations of these materials created contrasts that were very popular at the time – for example the mixing together of highly polished wood and black lacquer with satin and furs. The barber shop in the Austin Reed store in London was designed by P. J. Westwood. It was soon regarded as the trendiest barber shop in Britain due to its use of metallic materials.

The color themes of Art Deco consisted of metallic color, neutral color, bright color, and black and white. In interior design, cool metallic colors including silver, gold, metallic blue, charcoal grey, and platinum tended to predominate. Serge Chermayeff, a Russian-born British designer made extensive use of cool metallic colors and luxurious surfaces in his room schemes. His 1930 showroom design for a British dressmaking firm had a silver-grey background and black mirrored-glass wall panels.

Black and white was also a very popular color scheme during the 1920s and 1930s. Black and white checkerboard tiles, floors and wallpapers were very trendy at the time. As the style developed, bright vibrant colors became popular as well.

Art Deco furnishings and lighting fixtures had a glossy, luxurious appearance with the use of inlaid wood and reflective finishes. The furniture pieces often had curved edges, geometric shapes, and clean lines. Art Deco lighting fixtures tended to make use of stacked geometric patterns.

=== Modern art ===
Modern design grew out of the decorative arts, mostly from the Art Deco, in the early 20th century. One of the first to introduce this modernist style was Frank Lloyd Wright, who had not become hugely popularized until completing the house called Fallingwater in the 1930s. Modern art reached its peak during the 1950s and &#x27;60s, which is why designers and decorators today may refer to modern design as being &quot;mid-century&quot;. Modern art does not refer to the era or age of design and is not the same as contemporary design, a term used by interior designers for a shifting group of recent styles and trends.

===Arab materials===
&quot;Majlis painting&quot;, also called nagash painting, is the decoration of the majlis, or front parlor of traditional Arabic homes, in the Asir province of Saudi Arabia and adjoining parts of Yemen. These wall paintings, an arabesque form of mural or fresco, show various geometric designs in bright colors: &quot;Called &#x27;nagash&#x27; in Arabic, the wall paintings were a mark of pride for a woman in her house.&quot;

The geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the area&#x27;s textile and weaving patterns. &quot;In contrast with the sobriety of architecture and decoration in the rest of Arabia, exuberant color and ornamentation characterize those of Asir. The painting extends into the house over the walls and doors, up the staircases, and onto the furniture itself. When a house is being painted, women from the community help each other finish the job. The building then displays their shared taste and knowledge. Mothers pass these on to their daughters. This artwork is based on a geometry of straight lines and suggests the patterns common to textile weaving, with solid bands of different colors. Certain motifs reappear, such as the triangular mihrab or &#x27;niche&#x27; and the palmette. In the past, paint was produced from mineral and vegetable pigments. Cloves and alfalfa yielded green. Blue came from the indigo plant. Red came from pomegranates and a certain mud. Paintbrushes were created from the tough hair found in a goat&#x27;s tail. Today, however, women use modern manufactured paint to create new looks, which have become an indicator of social and economic change.&quot;

Women in the Asir province often complete the decoration and painting of the house interior. &quot;You could tell a family&#x27;s wealth by the paintings,&quot; Um Abdullah says: &quot;If they didn&#x27;t have much money, the wife could only paint the motholath, the basic straight, simple lines, in patterns of three to six repetitions in red, green, yellow and brown.&quot; When women did not want to paint the walls themselves, they could barter with other women who would do the work. Several Saudi women have become famous as majlis painters, such as Fatima Abou Gahas.

The interior walls of the home are brightly painted by the women, who work in defined patterns with lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree-like patterns. &quot;Some of the large triangles represent mountains. Zigzag lines stand for water and also for lightning. Small triangles, especially when the widest area is at the top, are found in pre-Islamic representations of female figures. That the small triangles found in the wall paintings in &#x27;Asir are called banat may be a cultural remnant of a long-forgotten past.&quot;

&quot;Courtyards and upper pillared porticoes are principal features of the best Nadjdi architecture, in addition to the fine incised plaster wood (jiss) and painted window shutters, which decorate the reception rooms. Good examples of plasterwork can often be seen in the gaping ruins of torn-down buildings- the effect is light, delicate and airy. It is usually around the majlis, around the coffee hearth and along the walls above where guests sat on rugs, against cushions. Doughty wondered if this &quot;parquetting of jis&quot;, this &quot;gypsum fretwork... all adorning and unenclosed&quot; originated from India. However, the Najd fretwork seems very different from that seen in the Eastern Province and Oman, which are linked to Indian traditions, and rather resembles the motifs and patterns found in ancient Mesopotamia. The rosette, the star, the triangle and the stepped pinnacle pattern of dadoes are all ancient patterns, and can be found all over the Middle East of antiquity. Al-Qassim Province seems to be the home of this art, and there it is normally worked in hard white plaster (though what you see is usually begrimed by the smoke of the coffee hearth). In Riyadh, examples can be seen in unadorned clay.

==Media popularization==

Interior design has become the subject of television shows. In the United Kingdom, popular interior design and decorating programs include &quot;60 Minute Makeover&quot; (ITV), &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; (BBC), and &quot;Selling Houses&quot; (Channel 4). Famous interior designers whose work is featured in these programs include Linda Barker and Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. In the United States, the TLC Network aired a popular program called &quot;Trading Spaces&quot;, a show based on the UK program &quot;Changing Rooms&quot;. In addition, both HGTV and the DIY Network also televise many programs about interior design and decorating, featuring the works of a variety of interior designers, decorators, and home improvement experts in a myriad of projects.

Fictional interior decorators include the Sugarbaker sisters on &quot;Designing Women&quot; and Grace Adler on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. There is also another show called &quot;Home MADE&quot;. There are two teams and two houses and whoever has the designed and made the worst room, according to the judges, is eliminated. Another show on the Style Network, hosted by Niecy Nash, is &quot;Clean House&quot; where they re-do messy homes into themed rooms that the clients would like. Other shows include &quot;Design on a Dime&quot;, &quot;Designed to Sell&quot;, and &quot;The Decorating Adventures of Ambrose Price&quot;. The show called &quot;Design Star&quot; has become more popular through the five seasons that have already aired. The winners of this show end up getting their own TV shows, of which are &quot;Color Splash&quot; hosted by David Bromstad, &quot;Myles of Style&quot; hosted by Kim Myles, &quot;Paint-Over!&quot; hosted by Jennifer Bertrand, &quot;The Antonio Treatment&quot; hosted by Antonio Ballatore, and finally &quot;Secrets from a Stylist&quot; hosted by Emily Henderson. Bravo also has a variety of shows that explore the lives of interior designers. These include &quot;Flipping Out&quot;, which explores the life of Jeff Lewis and his team of designers; &quot;Million Dollar Decorators&quot; explores the lives of interior designers Nathan Turner, Jeffrey Alan Marks, Mary McDonald, Kathryn Ireland, and Martyn Lawrence Bullard.

Interior design has also become the subject of radio shows. In the U.S., popular interior design &amp; lifestyle shows include &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; and &quot;Living Large&quot; featuring Karen Mills. Famous interior designers whose work is featured on these programs include Bunny Williams, Barbara Barry, and Kathy Ireland, among others.

Many interior design magazines exist to offer advice regarding color palette, furniture, art, and other elements that fall under the umbrella of interior design. These magazine often focus on related subjects to draw a more specific audience. For instance, architecture as a primary aspect of &quot;Dwell&quot;, while &quot;Veranda&quot; is well known as a luxury living magazine. &quot;Lonny Magazine&quot; and the newly relaunched, &quot;Domino Magazine&quot;, cater to a young, hip, metropolitan audience, and emphasize accessibility and a do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to interior design.

<text>The Wendish Crusade () was a military campaign in 1147, one of the Northern Crusades, led primarily by the Kingdom of Germany within the Holy Roman Empire and directed against the Polabian Slavs (or &quot;Wends&quot;). The Wends were made up of the Slavic tribes of Abrotrites, Rani, Liutizians, Wagarians, and Pomeranians who lived east of the River Elbe in present-day northeast Germany and Poland.

The lands inhabited by the Wends were rich in resources, which played a factor in the motivations of those who participated in the crusade. The mild climate of the Baltic area allowed for the cultivation of land and livestock. Animals of this region were also thickly furred, supporting the dependence on fur trading. Access to the coastline also developed fishing and trade networks. The land was attractive for the resources it boasted, and the crusade offered an opportunity for noble families to gain part of it.

By the early 12th century, the German archbishoprics of Bremen and Magdeburg sought the conversion to Christianity of neighboring pagan West Slavs through peaceful means. During the preparation of the Second Crusade to the Holy Land, a papal bull was issued supporting a crusade against these Slavs. The Slavic leader Niklot preemptively invaded Wagria in June 1147, leading to the march of the crusaders later that summer. They achieved an ostensible forced baptism of Slavs at Dobin but were repulsed from Demmin. Another crusading army marched on the already Christian city of Szczecin (Stettin), whereupon the crusaders dispersed upon arrival (see below).

The Christian army, composed primarily of Saxons and Danes, forced tribute from the pagan Slavs and affirmed German control of Wagria and Polabia through colonization, but failed to convert the bulk of the population immediately.

==Background==
The Ottonian dynasty supported eastward expansion of the Holy Roman Empire towards Wendish (West Slavic) lands during the 10th century. The campaigns of King Henry the Fowler and Emperor Otto the Great led to the introduction of burgwards to protect German conquests in the lands of the Sorbs. Otto&#x27;s lieutenants, Margraves Gero and Hermann Billung, advanced eastward and northward respectively to claim tribute from conquered Slavs. Bishoprics were established at Meissen, Brandenburg, Havelberg, and Oldenburg to administer the territory. A majority of Wendish tribes had been Christianized from the German conquests, but in 983 they returned to paganism when a great Slavic rebellion reversed the initial German gains. While the burgwards allowed the Saxons to retain control of Meissen, they lost Brandenburg and Havelberg. The Elbe River then became the eastern limit of German-Roman control.

By the early 12th century, the Archbishoprics of Bremen, Magdeburg and Gniezno sought the conversion of the pagan Slavs to Christianity through peaceful means: notable missionaries included Vicelin, Norbert of Xanten, and Otto of Bamberg (sent to Pomerania by Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland). Lacking support from the Salian dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire, secular Saxon princes seeking Slavic territory found themselves in a military stalemate with their adversaries. Christians, especially Saxons from Holstein, and pagans raided each other across the Limes Saxonicus, usually for tribute.

The idea of a crusade against the Wends first originated in the Magdeburg Letter, originally sent around 1107 to 1110, in which an anonymous author makes an appeal against the Wends. The Magdeburg Letter makes the case that the Wends are pagans and that any fight against them is justified and the land that they inhabit is &quot;our Jerusalem&quot;. In the letter no formal spiritual indulgence is offered apart from a general salvation of the soul, but an emphasis is put on acquiring land. The author says, &quot;these gentiles [pagans] are most wicked, but their land is the best, rich in meat, honey, corn, and birds; and if it were well cultivated none could be compared to it for the wealth of its produce. So say those who know it. And so, most renowned Saxon, French, Lorrainers, and Flemings and conquerors of the world, this is an occasion for you to save your souls and, if you wish it, acquire the best land in which to live.&quot; The references made to the wealth of resources in the Slavic lands would have been especially appealing to those who were motivated by material gain. The Magdeburg letter established the ideas of a northern crusade and land acquisition that would come to play defining roles of the Wendish Crusade.

From 1140–43 Holsatian nobles advanced into Wagria to settle in the lands of the pagan Wagri permanently. Count Adolf II of Holstein and Henry of Badewide took control of Polabian settlements which would later become Lübeck and Ratzeburg; Vicelin was subsequently installed as bishop at Oldenburg. Adolf sought peace with the chief of the Obodrite confederacy, Niklot, and encouraged German colonization and missionary activity in Wagria.

The fall of Edessa in Syria in 1144 shocked Christendom, causing Pope Eugenius III and St. Bernard of Clairvaux to preach a Second Crusade to reinforce Outremer. While many south Germans volunteered to crusade in the Middle East, the north German Saxons were reluctant. They told Bernard of their desire to campaign against the Slavs at a Reichstag meeting in Frankfurt on 13 March 1147. The Wends were seen as a threat to Christendom as they were apostates, meaning the crusade against them would be justified. Approving of the Saxons&#x27; plan, Pope Eugenius III issued a papal bull known as the &quot;Divina dispensatione&quot; on 11 April 1147. As part of the bull, Eugenius III fulfilled and validated a promise made by Bernard that the same indulgences would be offered to those who crusaded against the Wends as those who went to fight in the Middle East. These indulgences offered a complete forgiveness of sin, meaning there was to be no difference between the spiritual rewards of the different crusaders. Those who volunteered to crusade against the Slavic pagans were primarily Danes, Saxons, and Poles, although there were also some Bohemians. In preaching the Crusade, Bernard feared that those who participated were doing so only for the possible material gain. In an effort to persuade crusaders to focus on spiritual conversion, Bernard said, &quot;We prohibit completely that a truce be made for any reason with these people [Wends] either for money or tribute, until such time as, with the aid of God either their religion or their nation shall be destroyed,&quot; which was an condition added to the papal bull. The German monarchy took no part in the crusade, which was led by Saxon families such as the Ascanians, Wettin, and Schauenburgers. Papal legate Anselm of Havelberg was placed in overall command.

==War==

Upset at Adolf&#x27;s participation in the crusade, Niklot preemptively invaded Wagria in June 1147, and, along with the Wagrians, decimated newly settled Fleming and Frisian villages, leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147. By attacking first, Niklot gave further justification for the Crusade as he legitimized the Wends as a serious threat to Christendom. After expelling the Obodrites from his territory, Adolf signed a peace treaty with Niklot. The remaining Christian crusaders targeted the Obodrite fort Dobin and the Liutizian fort Demmin.

The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes Canute V and Sweyn III, Archbishop Adalbert II of Bremen, and Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony. Avoiding pitched battles, Niklot ably defended the marshland of Dobin. One army of Danes was defeated by Slavs from Dobin, while another had to defend the Danish fleet from Niklot&#x27;s allies, the Rani of Rügen. Henry and Adalbert maintained the siege of Dobin after the retreat of the Danes. When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside, others objected by asking, &quot;Is not the land we are devastating our land, and the people we are fighting our people?&quot; The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after Niklot agreed to have Dobin&#x27;s garrison undergo baptism.

The Saxon army directed against Demmin was led by several bishops, including those of Mainz, Halberstadt, Münster, Merseburg, Brandenburg, Olmütz, and Bishop Anselm of Havelberg. While their stated goal was to achieve the conversion of the pagans, most also sought additional territory and tithe for their dioceses; Abbot Wibald of Corvey went in the hopes of acquiring the island of Rügen. The Demmin campaign also included the secular margraves Conrad I and Albert the Bear, who hoped to expand their marches. A Royal Polish contingent wanted to add to the Bishopric of Lebus. Marching from Magdeburg, Albert the Bear recovered Havelberg, lost since the 983 Slavic rebellion. The crusaders then destroyed a pagan temple and castle at Malchow. After an unsuccessful siege of Demmin, a contingent of crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack central Pomerania instead. They reached the already Christian city Szczecin, whereupon the crusaders dispersed after meeting with Bishop Adalbert of Pomerania and Duke Ratibor I of Pomerania.

==Aftermath==

The Wendish Crusade achieved mixed results. While the Saxons affirmed their possession of Wagria and Polabia, Niklot retained control of the Obodrite land east of Lübeck. The Saxons also received tribute from Niklot, enabled the colonization of the Bishopric of Havelberg, and freed some Danish prisoners. However, the disparate Christian leaders, mostly Canute and Sweyn, regarded their counterparts with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign.
According to Bernard of Clairvaux, the goal of the crusade was to battle the pagan Slavs &quot;until such a time as, by God&#x27;s help, they shall either be converted or deleted&quot;. However, the crusade failed to achieve the conversion of most of the Wends. In preaching the Crusade, Bernard had urged to not make truce or accept any form of tribute, but the crusaders did receive tribute from Niklot as mentioned, which contributed to Bernard&#x27;s perception of the crusade as a failure. The Saxons achieved largely token conversions at Dobin, as the Slavs returned to their pagan beliefs once the Christian armies dispersed; Albert of Pomerania explained, &quot;If they had come to strengthen the Christian faith ... they should have done so by preaching, not by arms&quot;. There was no Wendish clergy established nor any Christian literature translated into the language of the Wends. Without any institutions in place, the forced conversion of the Wends was not sustainable. The only successful conversions were achieved by the Danes. The Danes recaptured the island of Rügen in 1168 and were able to re-Christianize it through the establishment of churches and by allowing Prince Jaromit of Rügen to remain in power after he fully accepted Christianity. The Danes were able to be successful through their method of encouraging Christianity rather than focusing solely on controlling the newly acquired land.

In this way, the Crusade could be viewed as a success in terms of its successful acquisition of Slavic lands as it encouraged colonization by German settlers. It also began a long-lasting crusade against the Wends that lasted the rest of the twelfth century. By the 1160s, most of the Wends had come under the control of the Saxons or the Danes. However, in 1180 when Henry the Lion and Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa had a falling out, the Danes were able to assert political control over a majority of the region. The effects of the Wendish Crusade was long-lasting through the impacts it had on extending political and colonial power in the Baltic region.

<text>Georgetown University Law Center is the law school of Georgetown University, a private research university in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in 1870 and is the largest law school in the United States by enrollment, with over 2,000 students. It frequently receives the most full-time applications of any law school in the United States. Georgetown is considered part of the T14, an unofficial designation in the legal community of the best 14 law schools in the United States.

The school&#x27;s campus is less than a mile from the U.S. Capitol Building. Prominent alumni include 11 members of the United States Congress, federal and state judges, billionaires, and diplomats.
==History==

Opened as Georgetown Law School in 1870, Georgetown Law was the second (after St. Louis University) law school run by a Jesuit institution within the United States. Georgetown Law has been separate from the main Georgetown campus (in the neighborhood of Georgetown) since 1890, when it moved near what is now Chinatown. 

The Law Center campus is located on New Jersey Avenue, within a mile from the Capitol, and a few blocks west of Washington Union Station. Georgetown Law School changed its name to Georgetown University Law Center in 1953. The school added the Edward Bennett Williams Law Library in 1989 and the Gewirz Student Center in 1993, providing on-campus living for the first time. The &quot;Campus Completion Project&quot; finished in 2004 with the addition of the Hotung International Building and the Sport and Fitness Center.

Georgetown Law&#x27;s original wall (or sign) is preserved on the quad of the present-day campus.

==Admissions==
For the class entering in the fall of 2023, 2,119 out of 10,827 J.D. applicants (19.6%) were offered admission, with 570 (26.90%) matriculating. The median LSAT score for the class entering in fall of 2023 is 171 and the median undergraduate GPA is 3.91. In the 2023-24 academic year, Georgetown Law had 2,079 J.D. students, of which 29% were minorities and 56% were female.

==Bar examination passage==
In 2023, the overall bar examination passage rate for the law school’s first-time examination takers was 90.51%. The Ultimate Bar Pass Rate, which the ABA defines as the passage rate for graduates who sat for bar examinations within two years of graduating, was 97.17% for the class of 2021.

==Employment==

Of the 691 J.D. graduates in the Georgetown Law class of 2020 (including both full- and part-time students), 569 (82.3%) held long-term, full-time positions that required bar exam passage (i.e., jobs as lawyers) and were not school-funded nine months after graduation. 644 graduates overall (93.2%) were employed, 6 graduates (0.9%) were pursuing a graduate degree, and 34 graduates (4.9%) were unemployed.

435 J.D. graduates (63.0%) were employed in the private sector, with 368 (53.3%) at law firms with over 250 attorneys. 208 graduates (30.1%) entered the public sector, with 80 (11.6%) employed in public interest positions, 55 (8.0%) employed by the government, 68 (9.8%) in federal or state clerkships, and 5 (0.7%) in academic positions. 35 graduates (5.1%) received funding from Georgetown Law for their positions.

The median reported starting salary for a 2018 J.D. graduate in the private sector was $180,000. The median reported starting salary for a 2018 graduate in the public sector (including government, public interest, and clerkship positions) was $57,000.

272 J.D. graduates (39.4%) in the class of 2020 were employed in Washington, DC, 155 (22.4%) in New York, and 31 (4.5%) in California. 13 (1.9%) were employed outside the United States.

As of 2011, Georgetown Law alumni account for the second highest number of partners at NLJ 100 firms. It is among the top ten feeder schools in eight of the ten largest legal markets in the United States by law job openings (New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Houston, San Francisco, and San Diego), again giving it the second-widest reach of all law schools. The school performs especially strongly in its home market, where it is the largest law school and has produced the greatest number of NLJ 100 partners.

Georgetown Law was ranked #11 for placing the highest percentage of 2018 J.D. graduates into associate positions at the 100 largest law firms.

==Costs==
The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Georgetown Law for the 2024-25 academic year is $113,450. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $419,938.

==Campus==

The Law Center is located in the Capitol Hill area of Washington, D.C. It is bounded by 2nd St. NW to the west, E St. NW to the south, 1st St. NW and New Jersey Avenue to the east, and Massachusetts Avenue to the north.

The campus consists of five buildings. Bernard P. McDonough Hall (1971, expanded in 1997) houses classrooms and Law Center offices and was designed by Edward Durell Stone. The Edward Bennett Williams Law Library building (1989) houses most of the school&#x27;s library collection and is one of the largest law libraries in the United States. The Eric E. Hotung International Law Center (2004), named after Hong Kong businessman and philanthropist Eric Edward Hotung, includes two floors of library space housing the international collection, and also contains classrooms, offices, and meeting rooms. The Bernard S. and Sarah M. Gewirz Student Center (1993) provides apartment-style housing for 250–300 students as well as hosting offices for nine academic centers and institutes, the Law Center&#x27;s Student Health clinic, the Center for Wellness Promotion, the Counseling and Psychiatric Service office, a dedicated prayer room for Muslim members of the Law Center community, a moot court room, a daycare (the Georgetown Law Early Learning Center), and a ballroom event space commonly used for academic conferences. The four-level Scott K. Ginsburg Sport &amp; Fitness Center (2004) includes a pool, fitness facilities, and cafe, and connects the Hotung Building to the Gewirz Student Center.
===Libraries===

The Georgetown Law Library supports the research and educational endeavors of the students and faculty of Georgetown University Law Center. It is the second largest law library in the United States, and as one of the premier research facilities for the study of law, the Law Library houses the nation&#x27;s fourth largest law library collection and offers access to thousands of online publications. The Law Library was ranked by &quot;The National Jurist&quot; as the 14th best law library in the nation in 2010.

The mission of the library is to support fully the research and educational endeavors of the students and faculty of Georgetown University Law Center, by collecting, organizing, preserving, and disseminating legal and law related information in any form, by providing effective service and instructional programs, and by utilizing electronic information systems to provide access to new information products and services.

The collection is split into two buildings. The Edward Bennett Williams Law Library (1989) is named after Washington, D.C. lawyer Edward Bennett Williams, an alumnus of the Law Center and founder of the prestigious litigation firm Williams &amp; Connolly. It houses the Law Center&#x27;s United States law collection, the Law Center Archives, and the National Equal Justice Library. The Williams library building consists of five floors of collection and study space and provides office space for most of the Law Center&#x27;s law journals on the Law Library&#x27;s first level.

The John Wolff International and Comparative Law Library (2004) is named after John Wolff, a long-serving member of the adjunct faculty and supporter of the Law Center&#x27;s international law programs. The library is located on two floors inside the Eric E. Hotung building. It houses the international, foreign, and comparative law collections of Georgetown University Law Center. Wolff Library collects primary and secondary law materials from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Scotland, and South Africa. English translations of primary and secondary legal materials from other jurisdictions and compilations of foreign law on special topics are also included.

In addition to foreign law, the Wolff Library maintains an extensive collection of public and private international law, focusing on international trade, international environmental law, human rights, arbitration, tax and treaty law. The collection also includes documentation from many international organizations, including the International Court of Justice, the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization.

==Curriculum==
Georgetown Law&#x27;s J.D. program can be completed over three years of full-time day study or three to four years of part-time evening study. The school offers several LL.M. programs in specific areas, most notably tax law, as well as a general LL.M. curriculum for lawyers educated outside the United States. Georgetown launched a Master of Studies in Law (M.S.L.) degree program for professional journalists in the 2007–08 academic year. It also offers the highest doctoral degree in law (J.S.D.).

Students are offered the choice of two tracks for their first year of study. &quot;Curriculum A&quot; is a traditional law curriculum similar to that taught at most schools, including courses in civil procedure, constitutional law, contracts, criminal justice, property, torts, and legal research and writing. Four-fifths of the day students at Georgetown receive instruction under the standard program (sections 1, 2, 4, and 5).

&quot;Curriculum B&quot; is a more interdisciplinary, theoretical approach to legal study, covering an equal or wider scope of material but heavily influenced by the critical legal studies movement. The Curriculum B courses are &quot;Bargain, Exchange and Liability&quot; (contracts and torts), &quot;Democracy and Coercion&quot; (constitutional law and criminal procedure), &quot;Government Processes&quot; (administrative law), &quot;Legal Justice&quot; (jurisprudence), &quot;Legal Practice&quot; (legal research and writing), &quot;Legal Process and Society&quot; (civil procedure), and &quot;Property in Time&quot; (property). One-fifth of the full-time JD students receive instruction in the alternative Curriculum B program (Section 3).

Students in both curricula may participate in a week-long introduction to international law between the fall and spring semesters.

==Clinics ==
Georgetown&#x27;s clinics are: Appellate Litigation Clinic, Center for Applied Legal Studies, The Community Justice Project, Criminal Defense &amp; Prisoner Advocacy Clinic, Criminal Justice Clinic, D.C. Law Students in Court, D.C. Street Law Program, Domestic Violence Clinic, Federal Legislation and Administrative Clinic, Harrison Institute for Housing &amp; Community Development Clinic, Harrison Institute for Public Law, Institute for Public Representation, International Women&#x27;s Human Rights Clinic, Juvenile Justice Clinic, Intellectual Property and Information Policy Clinic, and Communications and Technology Law Clinic.

In the Winter 2017 edition of &quot;The National Jurist,&quot; Georgetown Law&#x27;s Moot Court Program was ranked #4 in the country for 2015–16 and #5 among U.S. law schools that have had the best moot courts this past decade.

===Appellate Litigation Clinic===
Directed by Professor Erica Hashimoto (following 36 years of leadership by Professor Steven H. Goldblatt), the Appellate Litigation Clinic operates akin to a small appellate litigation firm. It has had four cases reach the United States Supreme Court on grants of writs of certiorari. One such case was &quot;Wright v. West&quot;, 505 U.S. 277 (1992), considered in habeas corpus the question whether the de novo review standard for mixed questions of law and fact established in 1953 (the &quot;Brown v. Allen&quot; standard) should be overruled. Another was &quot;Smith v. Barry&quot;, 502 U.S. 244 (1992), which reversed a Fourth Circuit determination that the court did not have jurisdiction over an appeal because the defendant&#x27;s pro se brief could not serve as a timely notice of appeal.

===Center for Applied Legal Studies===
CALS represents refugees seeking political asylum in the United States because of threatened persecution in their home countries. Students in CALS assume primary responsibility for the representation of these refugees, whose requests for asylum have already been rejected by the U.S. government. The Center for Applied Legal Studies was founded in the 1980s by Philip Schrag. Until 1995, the Clinic heard cases in the field of consumer protection. Under the direction of Schrag and Andrew Schoenholtz, the Clinic began specializing in asylum claims, for both detained and non-detained applicants. In conjunction with their work for the Clinic, Schrag and Schoenholtz have written books about America&#x27;s political asylum system, with the help of Clinic fellows and graduate students. The duo&#x27;s most recent book, &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot;, was published in 2014 and provides an empirical analysis of how Homeland Security decided asylum cases over a recent fourteen-year period. The group&#x27;s work in human rights law has met praise from international organizations like the United Nations Human Rights Council. Under the direction of Schrag and Schoenholtz, the clinic has also focused on more prolonged displacement situations for political refugees.

=== Civil Rights Clinic ===
CRC operates as a public interest law firm, representing individual clients and other public interest organizations, primarily in the areas of discrimination and constitutional rights, workplace fairness, and open government. The Clinic is directed by Professor Aderson Francois, who joined in 2016. Students work with CRC staff attorneys to litigate Freedom of Information Act claims, wage theft suits, and retaliation claims on behalf of employees terminated for asserting their rights under FLSA and DC Wage and Hour law.

===Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic===
Students in CDPAC represent defendants facing misdemeanor charges in D.C. Superior Court, facing parole or supervised release revocation from the United States Parole Commission working with the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, and they also work on prisoner advocacy projects. Abbe Smith is the director of CDPAC. Former Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia lawyer Vida Johnson works with Smith in CDPAC and the Prettyman fellowship program.

===DC Street Law Program===
The DC Street Law Program, Directed by Professor Charisma X. Howell, provides legal education to the DC population through two projects: the Street Law High Schools Clinic and the Street Law Community Clinic. Professor Richard Roe directed the Street Law High Schools Clinic since 1983. Professor Howell became the director in 2018. In the program, students introduce local high school students to the basic structure of the legal system, including the relationship among legislatures, courts, and agencies, and how citizens, especially in their world, relate to the lawmaking processes of each branch of government.

===Harrison Institute for Public Law===
The Harrison Institute is one of the longest running public law clinics in the country, having begun as the Project for Community Legal Assistance in 1972. In 1980 it was renamed in honor of Anne Blaine Harrison, a philanthropist and early supporter of the institute. Over its history, the institute has been home to several clinical programs, including focuses on state and local legislation, administrative advocacy, housing and community development, and policy. In 2019, under the directorship of Robert Stumberg, the institute consists of four policy teams: Climate, Health, Human Rights, and Trade. Each of these teams involves students working to shape policy to achieve client goals.

== Controversies ==
In January 2022, Ilya Shapiro, the incoming executive director and senior lecturer of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution, wrote in a tweet that he opposed President Biden&#x27;s intent to nominate a black woman to the Supreme Court, writing that because Biden would not nominate Shapiro&#x27;s friend Sri Srinivasan, he was choosing a &quot;lesser black woman.&quot; The dean of Georgetown University Law Center condemned the remarks, stating, &quot;The tweets&#x27; suggestion that the best Supreme Court nominee could not be a Black woman and their use of demeaning language are appalling...The tweets are at odds with everything we stand for at Georgetown Law.&quot; Shapiro later deleted the tweet as well as many other tweets he had written in the past, and issued a statement calling it an, &quot;inartful tweet.&quot; Shapiro was then placed on administrative leave while being investigated for violations of &quot;professional conduct, non-discrimination, and anti-harassment&quot; rules. As a result of the investigation, Shapiro was reinstated, as the school&#x27;s investigators found that he was &quot;not properly subject to discipline.&quot; Nevertheless, on June 6 Shapiro chose to resign in protest, arguing that the school had &quot;implicitly repealed Georgetown&#x27;s vaunted Speech and Expression Policy and set me up for discipline the next time I transgress progressive orthodoxy.&quot;

<text>The Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS) is a non-profit research and educational corporation based in Honolulu, Hawaii. PVS was established to research and perpetuate traditional Polynesian voyaging methods. Using replicas of traditional double-hulled canoes, PVS undertakes voyages throughout Polynesia navigating without modern instruments.

==History==
The society was founded in 1973 by nautical anthropologist Ben Finney, Hawaiian artist Herb Kawainui Kane, and sailor Charles Tommy Holmes. The three wanted to show that ancient Polynesians could have purposely settled the Polynesian Triangle using non-instrument navigation. The first PVS project was to build a replica of a double-hulled voyaging canoe.

In the genesis of the Society, the East–West Center was instrumental in convincing the UN authorities in the Pacific of the necessity of the project. The navigator Pius &quot;Mau&quot; Piailug, master of the techniques of traditional navigation, was named Special Fellow by the Center.

===Hōkūleʻa===
On March 8, 1975, the first voyaging canoe to be built in the Hawaiian Islands in over 600 years was launched with captain Kawika Kapahulehua and crew. Named the &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot;, it left Hawaii on May 1, 1976 for Tahiti in an attempt to retrace the ancient voyaging route. Micronesian navigator Mau Piailug, using no instruments, successfully navigated the canoe to Tahiti, arriving there on June 3, 1976.

After an attempted voyage to Tahiti in 1978 was aborted when the &quot;Hokulea&quot; capsized near Lānai and crew member Eddie Aikau was lost at sea, Piailug trained Nainoa Thompson in the ancient navigation methods. Two years later in 1980, Thompson replicated the successful 1976 voyage to Tahiti, becoming the first modern Hawaiian to master the art of Micronesian navigation.

Since that voyage, the &quot;Hokulea&quot; and her sister canoe the &quot;Hawaiiloa&quot; (built 1991–94) have undertaken voyages to other islands in Polynesia, including Samoa, Tonga, and New Zealand. More recently, in 2012 the Polynesian Voyaging Society built a further sister ship, the &quot;Hikianalia&quot;.

From 2014 to 2017, Nainoa Thompson and the Mālama Honua Worldwide Voyage engaged on a 3-year trip to visit 13 marine World Heritage Sites around the world. UNESCO and the Polynesian Voyaging Society had signed a partnership agreement to promote those historical sites through PVS&#x27; sailing adventures.

=== Makali&quot;&quot;i ===
The &quot;Makali‘i&quot; was built on Hawaii (island). It was launched at Kawaihae on Saturday, February 4, 1995. Her maiden voyage was to Taputapuatea, Ra&#x27;iatea, in Tahiti Nui, and Nukuhiva in the Marquesas Islands in 1995, as part of Nā Ohana Holo Moana (The Voyaging Families of the Vast Ocean).

===Alingano Maisu===
On January 23, 2007 the &quot;Hokulea&quot; and the &quot;Alingano Maisu&quot; set sail on a voyage to Micronesia and Japan. In March 2007, the canoes arrived at Piailug&#x27;s home island of Satawal where five native Hawaiians and sixteen others were inducted into Pwo as master navigators. The event was the first Pwo ceremony on Satawal in 50 years and the &quot;Alingano Maisu&quot; was presented to Piailug as a gift for his contribution in reviving wayfinding navigation.

==Funding==
The &quot;Times Online&quot; reported in March 2009 that the US Congress had earmarked $238,000 for the Polynesian Voyaging Society. The funding was targeted by John McCain as pork-barrel-funding.

<text>Epic Games, Inc. is an American video game and software developer and publisher based in Cary, North Carolina. The company was founded by Tim Sweeney as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991, originally located in his parents&#x27; house in Potomac, Maryland. Following its first commercial video game release, &quot;ZZT&quot; (1991), the company became Epic MegaGames, Inc. in early 1992 and brought on Mark Rein, who has been its vice president since. After moving the headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio changed its name to Epic Games.

Epic Games developed Unreal Engine, a commercially available game engine which also powers its internally developed video games like &quot;Fortnite&quot; and the &quot;Unreal&quot;, &quot;Gears of War&quot;, and &quot;Infinity Blade&quot; series. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the &quot;most successful videogame engine&quot; by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. Epic Games owns the game developers Psyonix, Mediatonic, and Harmonix, and operates studios in multiple locations around the world. While Sweeney remains the controlling shareholder, Tencent acquired a 48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic towards a games as a service model. Following the release of the popular &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; in 2017, the company gained additional investments that enabled it to expand its Unreal Engine offerings, establish esports events around &quot;Fortnite&quot;, and launch the Epic Games Store. As of April 2022, the company has a equity valuation.

== History ==
=== Potomac Computer Systems (1991–1992) ===
Potomac Computer Systems was founded by Tim Sweeney in 1991. At the time, Sweeney was studying mechanical engineering and living in a dorm at the University of Maryland. He frequently visited his parents, who lived in nearby Potomac, Maryland, where his personal computer, used for both work and leisure, was situated. Out of this location, Sweeney started Potomac Computer Systems as a computer consulting business but later figured that it would be too much work he would have to put into keeping the business stable, and scrapped the idea.

After finishing his game &quot;ZZT&quot;, Sweeney opted to re-use the Potomac Computer Systems name to release the game to the public in January 1991. It was only with the unexpected success of &quot;ZZT&quot;, caused in most part by the easy modifiability of the game using Sweeney&#x27;s custom ZZT-oop programming language, that made Sweeney consider turning Potomac Computer Systems into a video game company. &quot;ZZT&quot; was sold through bulletin board systems, while all orders were fulfilled by Sweeney&#x27;s father, Paul Sweeney. The game sold several thousand copies as of May 2009, and Paul Sweeney still lived at the former Potomac Computer Systems address at the time, fulfilling all orders that eventually came by mail. The final copy of &quot;ZZT&quot; was shipped by Paul Sweeney in November 2013.

=== Epic MegaGames (1992–1999) ===

In early 1992, Sweeney found himself and his new-found video game company in a business where larger studios, such as Apogee Software and id Software, were dominant, and he had to find a more serious name for his. As such, Sweeney came up with &quot;Epic MegaGames&quot;, a name which incorporated &quot;Epic&quot; and &quot;Mega&quot; to make it sound like it represented a fairly large company (such as Apogee Software), although he was its only employee. Sweeney soon underwent searching for a business partner, and eventually caught up with Mark Rein, who previously quit his job at id Software and moved to Toronto, Ontario. Rein worked remotely from Toronto, and primarily handled sales, marketing and publishing deals; business development that Sweeney found to have significantly contributed to the company&#x27;s growth. Some time this season, the company soon had 20 employees consisting of programmers, artists, designers and composers. Among them was the 17-year old Cliff Bleszinski, who joined the company after submitting his game &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; to Sweeney. The following year, they had over 30 employees.

In 1996, Epic MegaGames produced a shareware isometric shooter called &quot;Fire Fight&quot;, developed by Polish studio Chaos Works. It was published by Electronic Arts. By 1997, Epic MegaGames had 50 people working for them worldwide. In 1998, Epic MegaGames released &quot;Unreal&quot;, a 3D first-person shooter co-developed with Digital Extremes, which expanded into a series of &quot;Unreal&quot; games. The company also began to license the core technology, the Unreal Engine, to other game developers.

=== Epic Games (1999–present) ===
====&quot;Unreal&quot; and personal computer games (1999–2006)====
In February 1999, Epic MegaGames announced that they had moved their headquarters to a new location in Cary, North Carolina, and would henceforth be known as simply Epic Games. Rein explained that &quot;&quot;Unreal&quot; was first created by developers who were scattered across the world, eventually, the team came together to finish the game and that&#x27;s when the real magic started. The move to North Carolina centralizes Epic, bringing all of the company&#x27;s talented developers under one roof.&quot; Furthermore, Sweeney stated that the &quot;Mega&quot; part of the name was dropped because they no longer wanted to pretend to be a big company, as was the original intention of the name when it was a one-man team. The follow-up game, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, shipped to critical acclaim the same year, at which point the studio had 13 employees.

The company launched the Make Something Unreal competition in 2004, aiming to reward video game developers who create mods using the Unreal game engine. Tripwire Interactive won US$80,000 in cash and computer hardware prizes over the course of the contest in the first contest in 2004.

====&quot;Gears of War&quot; and console games (2006–2012)====
Around 2006, the personal computer video game market was struggling with copyright infringement in the form of software piracy, and it became difficult to make single-player games, elements that had been part of Epic&#x27;s business model to that point. The company decided to shift focus into developing console systems, a move which Sweeney called the start of the third major iteration of the company, &quot;Epic 3.0&quot;. In 2006, Epic released the Xbox 360 shooter &quot;Gears of War&quot;, which became a commercial success for the company, grossing about off a budget. A year later, the company released &quot;Unreal Tournament 3&quot; for PC and acquired a majority share in People Can Fly.

In 2008, Epic Games released &quot;Gears of War 2&quot;, selling over three million copies within the first month of its release.

Epic Games released on September 1, 2010 Epic Citadel as a tech demo to demonstrate the Unreal Engine 3 running on Apple iOS, within Adobe Flash Player Stage3D and using HTML5 WebGL technologies. It was also released for Android on January 29, 2013. Epic Games worked on an iOS game, &quot;Infinity Blade&quot;, which was released on December 9, 2010. The third game in the series, &quot;Gears of War 3&quot;, came out in 2011.

In 2011, Epic&#x27;s subsidiary Titan Studios was dissolved. At the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, Epic Games announced their new game &quot;Fortnite&quot;. In March 2012, Epic Games China became independent from Epic as Ying Pei Games (), developing &quot;Mercenary Ops&quot; at the time&quot;,&quot; while Epic still retained a minority stake. 

In June 2012, Epic announced that it was opening up a new studio, Epic Baltimore, made up of members of 38 Studios&#x27; Big Huge Games. Epic Baltimore was renamed to Impossible Studios in August 2012. However, the studio ended up closing its doors in February 2013.

Epic fully acquired People Can Fly in August 2012, rebranding them as Epic Games Poland in November 2013 as they began work on &quot;Fortnite&quot; alongside Epic. Epic alongside People Can Fly made one last game in the &quot;Gears of War&quot; series that served as a prequel to the other games, &quot;Gears of War: Judgement&quot;, which was released in 2013. At this point, Epic had considered developing a fourth main title for &quot;Gears of War&quot;, but estimated that its budget would be at least . Additionally, they had suggested the idea of a multiplayer-only version of &quot;Gears of War&quot; that featured improved versions of maps based on user feedback, similar to the concept behind &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, but Microsoft rejected this idea. Epic recognized the troubles of being held to the business objectives of a publisher and began to shift the company again.

==== Games as a service and Tencent shareholding (2012–2018) ====

Coupled with their desire to move away from being beholden to a publisher, Epic Games observed that the video game industry was shifting to a games-as-a-service model (GaaS). Sweeney stated, &quot;There was an increasing realization that the old model wasn&#x27;t working anymore and that the new model was looking increasingly like the way to go.&quot; In an attempt to gain more GaaS experience, they made an agreement with Chinese Tencent, who had several games under their banner (including Riot Games&#x27; &quot;League of Legends&quot;) operating successfully as games as a service. In exchange for Tencent&#x27;s help, Tencent acquired approximately 48.4% of Epic then issued share capital, equating to 40% of total Epic – inclusive of both stock and employee stock options, for $330 million in June 2012. Tencent Holdings has the right to nominate directors to the board of Epic Games and thus counts as an associate of the Group. However, Sweeney stated that Tencent otherwise has very little control on the creative output of Epic Games. Sweeney considered the partial acquisition by Tencent as the start of &quot;Epic 4.0&quot;, the fourth major iteration of the company, allowing the company to be more agile in the video game marketplace.

Around this point, Epic had about 200 employees. A number of high-profile staff left the company months after the Tencent deal was announced for various reasons. Some notable departures included:
* Cliff Bleszinski, then the design director, announced he was leaving Epic Games in October 2012 after 20 years with the company. His official reason was &quot;It&#x27;s time for a much-needed break&quot;. Bleszinski later stated that he had become &quot;jaded&quot; about the gaming industry in the lead-up to Tencent&#x27;s involvement. After Tencent&#x27;s investment, Bleszinski attempted to renegotiate his contract but failed to come to terms, making him think about retirement instead. He opted to stop coming to work, spending his time at his beach house, eventually leading Sweeney to come down and have a heart-to-heart discussion with Bleszinski on the new direction Epic was going, and asking him to make a firm decision regarding his commitment to Epic. Bleszinski opted to write his resignation letter the next day. After about two years, Bleszinski started Boss Key Productions in 2014.
* President Mike Capps announced his retirement in December 2012, and cited as reasons the birth of a baby boy he was having with his wife and his plans to be a stay-at-home dad. He subsequently announced quitting his advisory role as well as his affiliation with the company in March 2013.
* Rod Fergusson, who had been a lead developer for the &quot;Gears of War&quot; series, left Epic in August 2012. Fergusson stated that he had seen the direction that the Tencent acquisition would have taken the company, and was not interested in the free-to-play style of games but instead wanted to continue developing a &quot;AAA, big-narrative, big-story, big-impact game&quot;. Fergusson briefly joined Irrational Games, owned by 2K Games, to help complete &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;. While there, Fergusson talked with 2K about potentially continuing the &quot;Gears of War&quot; series, leading to talks between 2K Games, Epic, and Microsoft. As a result, Microsoft acquired the rights to &quot;Gears of War&quot; on January 27, 2014, eventually assigned those to Microsoft Game Studios; Fergusson moved to Black Tusk Studios, owned by Microsoft Game Studios, to take on lead development for a new &quot;Gears&quot; title, with the studio being rebranded as The Coalition. The first game since the acquisition, &quot;Gears of War 4&quot;, was released in October 2016.
* Adrian Chmielarz, the founder of People Can Fly, who joined Epic when his studio was acquired earlier in 2012, decided to leave after Tencent&#x27;s acquisition, stating that he and other former People Can Fly members did not believe the free-to-play games as a service direction fit their own personal vision or direction they wanted to go. Chmielarz and these others left Epic in late 2012 to form The Astronauts.
* Lee Perry, a lead designer on both &quot;Unreal&quot; and &quot;Gears of War&quot; series, felt that Epic has started to grow too large to maintain a role as an eccentric game developer. Coupled with the studio&#x27;s need for more management to support the games as a service model, Perry felt that their creative freedom would become limited. He and five other senior people left Epic to form a new studio, Bitmonster.

Epic continued its goal to deliver games as a service following these departures. &quot;Fortnite&quot; was to serve as their testbed for living games, but with the shifts in staff, and its engine from Unreal Engine 3 to 4, its release suffered some setbacks. Epic started additional projects; the free-to-play and community-developed &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, first announced in 2014, and the free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena game &quot;Paragon&quot;, launched in 2016 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4. Epic also released a remastered version of &quot;Shadow Complex&quot; for newer consoles and computers in 2015, and their first foray into virtual reality with the release of &quot;Robo Recall&quot; for the Oculus Rift.

The investment infusion from Tencent allowed Epic Games to relicense the Unreal Engine 4 engine in March 2015 to be free for all users to develop with, with Epic taking 5% royalties on games developed with the engine.

In June 2015, Epic agreed to allow Epic Games Poland&#x27;s departure from the company and sold its shares in the studio; the studio reverted to their former name, People Can Fly. The &quot;Bulletstorm&quot; IP was retained by People Can Fly who has since launched a remastered version called &quot;Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition&quot; on April 7, 2017, published by Gearbox Software.

====&quot;Fortnite&quot; success (2018–present)====

By July 2017, &quot;Fortnite&quot; was finally in a state for public play. Epic launched the title through a paid early access then, with a full free-to-play release expected in 2018. Following on the popularity of &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;, a battle royale game released earlier in 2017, Epic developed a variant of &quot;Fortnite&quot; called &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, which was released in September 2017 as a free-to-play title across computer, console, and mobile platforms. &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; quickly gained an audience, amassing over 125 million players by May 2018 with estimates of having earned over by July 2018 through microtransactions, including its battle pass system. Epic Games, which had been valued at around at the time of Tencent&#x27;s acquisition, was estimated to be worth in July 2018 due to &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;, and expected to surpass by the end of 2018 with projected growth of the game. Player count continued to expand when Epic broke new ground by convincing Sony to change its stance on cross-platform play allowing players on any device to compete with each other in &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;. &quot;Fortnite&quot; has drawn nearly 250 million players as of March 2019.

&quot;Fortnite&quot;″s commercial success enabled Epic to make several changes to its other product offerings. In July 2018, it reduced the revenue cut that it took for assets sold on the Unreal Engine Marketplace from 30% to 12%. Epic launched the Epic Games Store digital storefront to compete with services like Steam and GOG.com, not only taking a 12% cut of revenue compared to the industry standard of 30%, but also eliminated the 5% cut for games using the Unreal engine sold via the storefront. However the company also refocused its development efforts to provide more support for Unreal and &quot;Fortnite&quot; by ending support for &quot;Paragon&quot; and &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;.

The financial success of &quot;Fortnite&quot; brought additional investment into Epic Games. Epic Games was one of eleven companies selected to be part of the Disney Accelerator program in 2017, providing Epic equity investment and access to some of Disney&#x27;s executives, and potential opportunity to work with Disney in the future. Disney had selected both Epic and aXiomatic as potential leads in the growing esports arena.

Epic&#x27;s has used its windfall to support its products. In January 2019, following a dispute between Improbable and Unity Technologies over changes to the acceptable uses of the Unity game engine, Epic announced it was partnering with Improbable to launch a fund to help bring developers they believe affected by these changes towards solutions that are more open and would have fewer service compatibilities. Epic launched a prize pool in February 2019 for &quot;Fortnite&quot;-related esports activities that it plans to run from 2019 onward. To expand its esports initiatives, Epic Games hired Nate Nanzer from Blizzard Entertainment and their commissioner of the Overwatch League in May 2019. At the 2019 Game Developers Conference, Epic announced it was launching a MegaGrants initiative, allowing anyone to apply for up to in funding to support game development using the Unreal Engine or for any project, even if not directly games-related, that would benefit the Unreal Engine. One of the first major funded entities under this was the Blender Foundation in July 2019, having received from the MegaGrants funding, to help them to improve and professionalize their Blender tools for 3D art creation.

Epic Games was given the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Special Award in June 2019 for its past and continuing developments for the Unreal Engine, a software which also earned it the Engineering Excellence Award from the Hollywood Professional Association.

Epic announced in March 2020 it was establishing a new multi-platform publishing label, Epic Games Publishing. Alongside this, the label had announced three deals with developers Remedy Entertainment, Playdead and GenDesign in which Epic would fully fund development and publishing (including employee salaries, quality assurance, localization, and marketing) of one or more games from each studio, but leaving full creative control and IP rights to the studio, and sharing profits, following Epic&#x27;s recouping of its investment, 50/50 with the studio. The company expanded their publishing options in October 2021 with Spry Fox and Eyes Out.

Unreal Engine 5 was announced on May 13, 2020, with plans for an early 2022 release. Alongside this announcement, Epic released its Epic Online Services, a free SDK toolset for online matchmaking and other similar cross-platform play support features based on &quot;Fortnite&quot;. Epic further waived all Unreal license fees retroactively for games up through the first in revenue, regardless of how they were published, retroactively starting from January 1, 2020.

&quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that Epic was nearing a valuation in June 2020 once it had completed a new investing round from its previous investors and newcomings T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Baillie Gifford. The company partnered with Christopher Nolan and Warner Bros. to acquire distribution rights for &quot;Inception&quot;, &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and &quot;The Prestige&quot; as part of &quot;Movie Nite&quot; on Fortnite&#x27;s &quot;Party Royale&quot; island. The film live streams were based on a user&#x27;s country.

Across July and August, Epic raised an additional in capital investment, bringing the company&#x27;s post-money equity valuation to . This included a investment from Sony, approximately a 1.4% stake in the company. The deal continues the two companies&#x27; technology collaboration after they had worked together on the development of Unreal Engine 5, but does not commit Epic to any exclusivity to the Sony PlayStation platform. Sweeney said that Sony had started talking with Epic about investing following the demonstration of the Unreal Engine 5 in May 2020.

Epic purchased Cary Towne Center in Cary, North Carolina, in January 2021, which had been scheduled to be closed and demolished after 2020, to be their new headquarters and campus, with the conversion to be complete by 2024. All of the existing mall&#x27;s structure, with the exception of a section housing the Belk department store, was razed. However, after no further actions, the Town of Cary revoked Epic&#x27;s zoning application on December 6, 2024, declaring it &quot;inactive&quot;.

Epic unveiled its MetaHuman Creator project in February 2021. Based on the technology from 3Lateral, Cubic Motion, and Quixel, the MetaHuman Creator is a browser-based application to allow game developers to create realistic human characters within a short amount of time starting from various presets, and then can be exported as pre-made models and animation files ready for use in Unreal Engine.

Epic announced a partnership with Cesium in March 2021 to bring its 3D geospatial data as a free add-on into the Unreal Engine.

In April 2021, Epic completed another round of funding to support the company&#x27;s &quot;long-term vision for the metaverse&quot;, putting the company&#x27;s valuation at . The round of funding included another strategic investment from Sony. Sweeney remains the controlling shareholder with these additional investments.

The Information reported that Epic Games was launching a new scripted entertainment division in October 2021, bringing on three former executives from Lucasfilm to manage it, with initial plans for a &quot;Fortnite&quot; film.

In February 2022, Epic Games announced that at least half a billion accounts have been created on its platform.

Epic released the initial beta version of RealityScan, a mobile app that uses the tools from Capturing Reality and Quixel, in April 2022. RealityScan allows users to create 3D models that can be imported into Sketchfab using photos taken by the user.

Epic received another $1 billion each from Sony and from Kirkbi, the parent company of The Lego Group, in April 2022 for continued support of building out Epic&#x27;s metaverse. These investments gave Kirkbi 3% ownership and increased Sony&#x27;s to 4.9%. With these investments, Epic had an estimated valuation of . Epic and Lego also announced their partnership to build a child-friendly space in the metaverse that same month.

The company announced in September 2023 that it was laying off 870 employees, along with divesting in Bandcamp to Songtradr and spinning off SuperAwesome into its own company. Sweeney said this move was needed to rein in spending, and did not anticipate there would be further layoffs in the future. Mediatonic reported a significant number of layoffs from their team, but remained part of Epic.

On February 7, 2024, Epic Games received a $1.5 billion investment from the Walt Disney Company. Pending regulatory approval, Disney will acquire a 9% stake. Disney plans to co-develop new games and an &quot;entertainment universe&quot; encompassing its properties with Epic. Part of this involved bringing more of the Disney properties to &quot;Fortnite&quot;; while &quot;Fortnite&quot; had already featured numerous cosmetics based on Marvel Comics and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Disney announced new plans to bring its classic animated characters and those from Pixar properties to the game.

In July 2024, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), an actor labor union of which numerous video game voice actors are members of, would initiate a labor strike against a number of video publishers, including Epic Games, over concerns about lack of A.I. protections related to not only video game actors, but also the use of A.I to replicate an actor’s voice, or create a digital replica of their likeness.

Epic launched Fab, a unified marketplace for Unreal Engine Marketplace, Sketchfab, AetStation Marketplace, and Quixel assets, on October 22, 2024.

Following an investigation by the Department of Justice, the two Tencent board members stepped down, as they were also board members on Riot Games, which was seen as a violation of the Sherman Act by the department. 

==Acquisitions==
In 2008, Epic acquired Utah based Chair Entertainment, developer of &quot;Undertow&quot;. Summer 2009 saw the launch of Chair&#x27;s &quot;Shadow Complex&quot;, an adventure game inspired by the &quot;Metroid&quot; series.

Epic announced in October 2018 that it had acquired in investment from seven firms: KKR, ICONIQ Capital, Smash Ventures, aXiomatic, Vulcan Capital, Kleiner Perkins, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. The firms join Tencent, Disney, and Endeavor as minority shareholders in Epic. With the investment, Epic Games was estimated to have a nearly valuation in October 2018.

Besides expanding support for &quot;Fortnite&quot; and the Epic Games Store, these investments allowed Epic to acquire additional firms. In January 2018, it was announced that Epic had acquired Cloudgine, a developer of cloud-based gaming software. The company also announced the acquisition of Kamu, a firm that offered anti-cheat software called Easy Anti-Cheat, in October 2018. A year later, in January 2019, Epic acquired 3Lateral and Agog Labs. 3Lateral is known for its &quot;digital human&quot; creations, using a combination of digital technology, motion capture, and other tools to create photo-realistic human subjects in real-time. Epic plans to add some of 3Lateral&#x27;s features to the Unreal Engine. Agog had developed SkookumScript, a platform for scripting events in video games; on the announcement of this acquisition, Agog stated they will stop the development of SkookumScript to work more on Unreal Engine scripting support.

Epic acquired Psyonix, the developer of &quot;Rocket League&quot;, in May 2019. Epic and Psyonix have had a past history, as Psyonix was originally founded a few miles from Epic&#x27;s headquarters and had contributed to Epic&#x27;s &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. Besides ongoing support for &quot;Rocket League&quot;, Psyonix developed an arcade-style car racing game inside of &quot;Fortnite&quot;, named &quot;Rocket Racing&quot;, which was added in December 2023.

Epic acquired the Twinmotion visualization tool used in architectural design in May 2019 from Abvent, and which they plan to expand and incorporate into their Unreal Engine offerings. Epic acquired Life on Air, the developers behind &quot;Houseparty&quot;, a social networking service, in June 2019. The monetary terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Epic later shuttered Houseparty&#x27;s app in October 2021, though the team behind it was continuing to develop social apps for Epic&#x27;s platforms.

In November 2019, Epic acquired Quixel, the world&#x27;s largest photogrammetry asset library which makes 3D models of objects based on real-world high-definition photography. Epic plans to open Quixel&#x27;s existing library of models to users of Unreal Engine, while the Quixel staff will continue to build out its assets within Epic. The company acquired Cubic Motion, a studio that provides highly detailed digital facial animations for both films and video games, in March 2020.

Epic acquired SuperAwesome, a firm that has developed services to support children-safe games and services around games, in September 2020, as to incorporate these elements more into Epic&#x27;s portfolio and to offer to other developers, particularly for games built around Epic&#x27;s vision of metaverse games.

Epic acquired the digital facial animation firm Hyprsense in November 2020.

In January 2021, Epic acquired RAD Game Tools, a company that makes a variety of middleware solutions for video game development which Epic plans to incorporate into the Unreal Engine. RAD&#x27;s tools will still remain available outside of Unreal as well.

In March 2021, Epic announced it was acquiring the Tonic Games Group, which includes developers Mediatonic and Fortitude Games. Mediatonic&#x27;s &quot;Fall Guys&quot;, a major success during 2020, would remain available on Steam while Epic would help to bring it to additional platforms. Epic buying Tonic Games Group falls under the company&#x27;s broader plans of creating its own metaverse. Additionally in March, Epic acquired Capturing Reality, the developers of RealityCapture, a photogrammetry suite that can create 3D models from numerous photographs. Epic plans to integrate RealityCapture into the Unreal Engine.

Epic Games acquired ArtStation, a professional artists&#x27; marketplace, in April 2021. As part of the acquisition, ArtStation members would gain access to Epic&#x27;s tools and support such as the Unreal Engine, while the ArtStation marketplace will reduce its take on purchases from 30% to 12%. In July 2021, Epic acquired Sketchfab, a marketplace for 3D models. As with ArtStation, the acquisition allowed Sketchfab to reduce its pricing structure, lowering its revenue cut on purchases to 12% and making their Sketchfab Plus level of membership free.

In November 2021, Epic Games acquired Harmonix, a music game developer, for undisclosed terms. Harmonix continued to support their existing games including &quot;Rock Band 4&quot; and &quot;Fuser&quot; while building out &quot;Fortnite&quot; musical experiences, adding a &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot; mode that mimics the note-matching gameplay of &quot;Rock Band&quot; in December 2023, and Epic&#x27;s larger metaverse plans,

Epic acquired the indie music platform Bandcamp in March 2022. Bandcamp was expected to remain independently operated under Epic while gaining the benefits of Epic&#x27;s backend services. In April 2023, Epic acquired Brazilian developer Aquiris Game Studio, developer of Horizon Chase, and changed its name to Epic Games Brasil, with the intention to be used in &quot;Fortnite&quot;. In September 2023, Epic sold Bandcamp to music licensing company Songtradr.

== Products ==
=== Video games ===
Epic Games is known for games such as &quot;ZZT&quot; developed by founder Tim Sweeney, various shareware titles including &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot; and &quot;Epic Pinball&quot;, the &quot;Unreal&quot; video game series, which is used as a showcase for its Unreal Engine, the &quot;Gears of War&quot; series which is now owned by The Coalition and Xbox Game Studios, &quot;Infinity Blade&quot;, &quot;Shadow Complex&quot;, &quot;Bulletstorm&quot;, and &quot;Fortnite&quot;.

=== Unreal Engine ===

Epic is the proprietor of the Unreal game engine. Originally developed for the Unreal and Unreal Tournament game series, Unreal Engine has a complete feature set of graphical rendering, sound processing, and physics. The engine is licensed to third party game developers who can modify the software to fit their needs.
Epic also provides support to the Unreal marketplace, a digital storefront for creators to sell Unreal assets to other developers. Further, since 2019, Epic has provided support for filmmakers which have utilized the Unreal Engine to create virtual sets for productions such as &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, and will be backing major animated feature film production using Unreal, starting with &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; with studios Hook Up, DuermeVela and FilmSharks.

=== Epic Games Store ===

Epic announced its own Epic Games Store, an open digital storefront for games on Windows, on December 4, 2018, which launched a few days later with The Game Awards 2018 presentation. Differing from Valve&#x27;s Steam storefront, which takes 30% of revenues (30/70 revenue-sharing agreement) from the sale of a game, the Epic Game Store will take 12%, as well as foregoing the 5% for games developed in the Unreal Engine, anticipating that these lower revenue-sharing agreements will draw developers to it. Epic opened a version of the store for Android devices worldwide and for iOS devices in Europe in January 2025 as a result of legal victories, one based on its suit against Google, and the second from the European Union&#x27;s enforcement of remedies towards Apple under the Digital Markets Act.

=== Epic Online Services ===
Epic Online Services is a free SDK based on Epic&#x27;s &quot;Fortnite&quot; code that allows developers to implement cross-platform play features in their games, including matchmaking, friends lists, leaderboards, and achievements, with support for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android systems. It was first released for all in May 2020. Support for anti-cheat and voice chat was added in June 2021.

=== Productivity products ===
Other productivity products include ArtStation, Sketchfab, Twinmotion, RealityCapture, RealityScan and Quixel. Epic and Autodesk partnered in September 2022, making Twinmotion available to Revit subscribers.

The MetaHuman Creator is a project based on technology from three companies acquired by Epic—3Lateral, Cubic Motion, and Quixel—to allow developers to quickly create realistic human characters that can then be exported for use within Unreal. Through partnership with Cesium, Epic plans to offer a free plugin to provide 3D geospatial data for Unreal users, allowing them to recreate any part of the mapped surface of Earth. Epic will include RealityCapture, a product it acquired with its acquisition of Capturing Reality that can generate 3D models of any object from a collection of photographs taken of it from multiple angles, and the various middleware tools offered by Epic Game Tools.

===Litigation with Silicon Knights===

On July 19, 2007, Canadian game studio Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for failure to &quot;provide a working game engine&quot;, causing the Ontario-based game developer to &quot;experience considerable losses&quot;. The suit alleged that Epic Games was &quot;sabotaging&quot; Unreal Engine 3 licensees. Epic&#x27;s licensing document stated that a working version of the engine would be available within six months of the Xbox 360 developer kits being released. Silicon Knights claimed that Epic missed this deadline and that when a working version of the engine was eventually released, the documentation was insufficient. The game studio also claimed Epic had withheld vital improvements to the game engine, claiming they were game-specific, while also using licensing fees to fund the development of its own titles rather than the engine itself.

In August 2007, Epic Games counter-sued Silicon Knights, alleging the studio was aware when it signed on that certain features of Unreal Engine 3 were still in development and that components would continue to be developed and added as Epic completed work on &quot;Gears of War&quot;. Therefore, in a statement, Epic said that &quot;SK knew when it committed to the licensing agreement that Unreal Engine 3 may not meet its requirements and may not be modified to meet them&quot;. Additionally, the counter-suit claimed that Silicon Knights had &quot;made unauthorized use of Epic&#x27;s Licensed Technology&quot; and had &quot;infringed and otherwise violated Epic&#x27;s intellectual property rights, including Epic&#x27;s copyrighted works, trade secrets, know how and confidential information&quot; by incorporating Unreal Engine 3 code into its own engine, the Silicon Knights Engine. Furthermore, Epic asserted the Canadian developer broke the contract when it employed this derivative work in an internal title and a second game with Sega, a partnership for which it never received a license fee.

On May 30, 2012, Epic Games defeated Silicon Knights&#x27; lawsuit and won its counter-suit for $4.45 million on grounds of copyright infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of contract, an injury award that was later doubled due to prejudgment interest, attorneys&#x27; fees and costs. Consistent with Epic&#x27;s counterclaims, the presiding judge, James C. Dever III, stated that Silicon Knights had &quot;deliberately and repeatedly copied thousands of lines of Epic Games&#x27; copyrighted code, and then attempted to conceal its wrongdoing by removing Epic Games&#x27; copyright notices and by disguising Epic Games&#x27; copyrighted code as Silicon Knights&#x27; own&quot;. Dever stated that evidence against Silicon Knights was &quot;overwhelming&quot;, as it not only copied functional code but also &quot;non-functional, internal comments Epic Games&#x27; programmers had left for themselves&quot;.

As a result, on November 7, 2012, Silicon Knights was directed by the court to destroy all game code derived from Unreal Engine 3, all information from licensee-restricted areas of Epic&#x27;s Unreal Engine documentation website, and to permit Epic Games access to the company&#x27;s servers and other devices to ensure these items have been removed. In addition, the studio was instructed to recall and destroy all unsold retail copies of games built with Unreal Engine 3 code, including &quot;Too Human&quot;, &quot;X-Men Destiny&quot;, &quot;The Sandman&quot;, &quot;The Box&quot;/&quot;Ritualyst&quot;, and &quot;Siren in the Maelstrom&quot; (the latter three titles were projects never released, or even officially announced).

On May 16, 2014, Silicon Knights filed for bankruptcy and a Certificate of Appointment was issued by the office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, with Collins Barrow Toronto Limited being appointed as trustee in bankruptcy.

===Apple and Google disputes===

Since as early as 2017, Tim Sweeney had questioned the need for digital storefronts like Valve&#x27;s Steam, Apple&#x27;s iOS App Store, and Google Play, to take a 30% revenue sharing cut, and argued that when accounting for current rates of content distribution and other factors needed, a revenue cut of 8% should be sufficient to run any digital storefront profitably. When Epic brought &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; to mobile devices, the company initially offered a sideloaded package for Android systems to bypass the Google Play store, but eventually also made it a store app.

On August 13, 2020, Epic Games updated &quot;Fortnite&quot; across all platforms, including the iOS and Android versions, to reduce the price of &quot;V-Bucks&quot; (the in-game currency) by 20% if they purchased directly from Epic. For iOS and Android users, if they purchased through the Apple or Google storefront, they were not given this discount, as Epic said they could not extend the discount due to the 30% revenue cut taken by Apple and Google. Within hours, both Apple and Google had removed &quot;Fortnite&quot; from their storefronts stating the means of bypassing their payment systems violated both storefronts guidelines. Epic immediately filed separate lawsuits against Apple and Google for antitrust and anticompetitive behavior in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Epic did not seek monetary damages in either case but instead was &quot;seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands, if not more, of third-party app developers.&quot; In comments on social media the next day, Sweeney said that they undertook the actions as &quot;we&#x27;re fighting for the freedom of people who bought smartphones to install apps from sources of their choosing, the freedom for creators of apps to distribute them as they choose, and the freedom of both groups to do business directly. The primary opposing argument is: &#x27;Smartphone markers [sic] can do whatever they want.&#x27; This is an awful notion. We all have rights, and we need to fight to defend our rights against whoever would deny them.&quot;

Apple responded to the lawsuit that it would terminate Epic&#x27;s developer accounts by August 28, 2020, leading Epic to file a motion for a preliminary injunction to force Apple to return &quot;Fortnite&quot; to the App Store and prevent them from terminating Epic&#x27;s developer accounts, as the latter action would leave Epic unable to update the Unreal Engine for any changes to iOS or macOS and leave developers that relied on Unreal at risk. The court granted the preliminary injunction against Apple from terminating the developer accounts as Epic had shown &quot;potential significant damage to both the Unreal Engine platform itself, and to the gaming industry generally&quot;, but refused to grant the injunction related to &quot;Fortnite&quot; as &quot;The current predicament appears of [Epic&#x27;s] own making.&quot; In September 2020, Epic Games, together with thirteen other companies, launched the Coalition for App Fairness, which aimed for better conditions for the inclusion of apps into app stores.

U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued her first ruling on Epic Games v. Apple on September 10, 2021. Rogers found in favor of Apple on nine of ten counts brought up against them in the case, including Epic&#x27;s charges related to Apple&#x27;s 30% revenue cut and Apple&#x27;s prohibition against third-party marketplaces on the iOS environment. Rogers did rule against Apple on the final charge related to anti-steering provisions, and issued a permanent injunction that, in 90 days from the ruling, blocked Apple from preventing developers from linking app users to other storefronts from within apps to complete purchases or from collecting information within an app, such as an email, to notify users of these storefronts. Rogers&#x27; ruling was upheld at the Ninth Circuit on appeals, and the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear the case, leaving Rogers&#x27; order against Apple in place.

Google initially sought to negotiate with Epic but later filed their own countersuit against Epic for breach of contract. The Google case was set as a jury trial, held in November and December 2023. Prior to this, other groups had filed their own lawsuits against Google for similar reasons as Epic, including a coalition of states and the Match Group, but these were settled just ahead of the trial. The jury found for Epic on all claims made, determining that Google maintained a monopoly on the Android marketplace by how it managed the Play Store and used its leverage as a big tech firm to make deal with partners, including some deals made as a result of the earlier settlements. A second phase of this trial to determine remedies is scheduled to occur in January 2024.

=== FTC child privacy settlement ===
In December 2022, Epic Games was fined a combined $520 million after the Federal Trade Commission accused the company of separate accounts related to &quot;Fortnite&quot;, one for violating COPPA related to children&#x27;s privacy by collecting personal data without parent or guardian consent, exposing children and teens to potential harassment, and a second related to misleading users into making unwanted purchases while playing the game. Epic Games said &quot;No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here. The laws have not changed, but their application has evolved and long-standing industry practices are no longer enough. We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players. Over the past few years, we&#x27;ve been making changes to ensure our ecosystem meets the expectations of our players and regulators, which we hope will be a helpful guide for others in our industry.&quot; Epic ultimately settled with the FTC, agreeing to pay $245 million in December 2024 in relation to the use of dark patterns it used to drive users to buy V-bucks, with $72 million being issued as refunds by the FTC to more than 600,000 users that had filed claims in the case.

== Criticism ==
Since the partial investment by the Chinese company Tencent, some consumers have become wary of Epic Games&#x27; reliability and use of their data, particularly in relationship with the Epic Games Store. These concerns have been connected to broader issues of general distrust of the Chinese government and Chinese corporations among some Western video game players. Epic has stated that Tencent does not have access to any of this private data nor provides this to the Chinese government.

In late March 2020, accusations began circulating on social media that the Epic Games social networking app &quot;Houseparty&quot; led to other services such as Netflix and Spotify being hacked. However, both Epic and Life on Air claimed this was a smear campaign against its product and offered a bounty for anyone able to substantiate their claim.

On August 13, 2020, Epic released a version of &quot;Fortnite&quot; that included a permanent discount on V-bucks across all platforms (except iOS and Android devices) if they purchased directly through Epic, bypassing Apple and Google&#x27;s storefronts. Both Apple and Google immediately delisted the game for violating the storefronts&#x27; terms of service by including their own storefront, which led Epic to file lawsuits against both companies the same day, accusing them of antitrust behavior in how they operate their app stores. While Apple was ultimately victorious in a bench trial in September 2021 and upheld through appeals, Google&#x27;s actions were found to be monopolistic by a jury trial in December 2023.

<text>George Uglow Pope (24 April 1820 – 11 February 1908), or G. U. Pope, was an Anglican Christian missionary and Tamil scholar who spent 40 years in Tamil Nadu and translated many Tamil texts into English. His popular translations included those of the Tirukkural and Thiruvasagam. 

He later took to teaching, running his own school in Ootacamund for while and then moving to head the Bishop Cotton Boys&#x27; School in Bangalore and after returning to England worked as a Lecturer at Balliol College, Oxford. A statue on the Chennai beach recognizes him for his contribution to the understanding and promotion of the Tamil language.

== Biography ==

George Uglow Pope was born on 24 April 1820 in Bedeque, Prince Edward Island in Canada. His father was John Pope (1791–1863), of Padstow, Cornwall, a merchant who became a missionary, who emigrated to Prince Edward Island in 1818, and Catherine Uglow (1797–1867), of Stratton, north Cornwall. The family moved to Nova Scotia, St. Vincent&#x27;s before returning to Plymouth, England in 1826 where John Pope became a prosperous merchant and ship-owner. George Uglow Pope&#x27;s and his younger brother William Burt Pope studied at the Wesleyan schools in Bury and Hoxton and at the age of fourteen George joined missionary service in southern India.

He left for South India in 1839 and arrived at Sawyerpuram near Tuticorin(now Thoothukudi) with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Pope started studying Tamil as a teenager in England and during the voyage to India and Pope later turned into a scholar of Tamil, Sanskrit and Telugu. In 1841 he was ordained by the Church of England and he married Mary Carver, daughter of another Anglican priest. Pope worked in the Tirunelveli region where he also interacted with other missionaries like Christian Friedrich Schwartz. In 1845, Mary died at Tuticorin and Pope moved to Madras(now Chennai). He married Henrietta Page, daughter of G. van Someren and they left for England in 1849. During this period he worked with many figures in the Oxford Catholic movement including such as Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, Archbishop Trench, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop John Lonsdale, E. B. Pusey, and John Keble.

Returning to Tanjore (now Thanjavur) in 1851, teaching at St Peter&#x27;s School, he found himself in conflict with other missionaries. In 1855, a Tamil priest Vedanayakam Shastri who was a disciple of Schwartz and a poet in the court of Maharaja Serfoji was flogged publicly resulting in a separation of Tamil church free of the Anglican church leading to the resignation of Pope. He founded a seminary at Sawyerpuram for training Anglican Tamil clergy but this too ran into trouble and he decided to move to Ootacamund (Ooty) in 1859. Here he founded a grammar school for European children (which ran from 1859 to 1870) which is now home to the Government Arts School and Stonehouse. The grammar school at Stonehouse cottage was opened by the Bishop of Madras on 2 July 1858 with Pope as Principal. The school moved elsewhere as the building was sold to the Trustees of the Lawrence Asylum in March 1859. Stonehouse cottage was then used to house the male asylum inmates and the Grammar school moved to new premises in Lovedale on 1 April 1869. He also founded Holy Trinity Church in Ooty. Pope was referred to with respect by the Tamilians as Pope Aiyar.

Pope became famous for his strictness and in 1870 he was made principal of Bishop Cotton Boys&#x27; School at Bangalore. He was also the first pastor of the All Saints Church at Bangalore. In 1881, Pope left India and settled in Oxford where he made a mark as a lecturer in Tamil and Telugu (1884). He received an honorary MA in 1886 and a Gold Medal of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1906.

He died on 11 February 1908. He delivered his last sermon on 26 May 1907. Pope was buried at St Sepulchre&#x27;s Cemetery, located in Jericho, central Oxford, England. After his death, his second wife, Henrietta, and two daughters received pension. Henrietta died on 11 September 1911 and is buried beside Pope. Three of their sons continued to work in India. John Van Someren Pope worked on education in Burma, Arthur William Uglow Pope served as a railway engineer in India and China; while Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Henry served in the medical service as a professor of ophthalmology at the Madras Medical College.

==Contributions to Tamil studies==
Pope was along with Joseph Constantius Beschi, Francis Whyte Ellis, and Bishop Robert Caldwell one of the major scholars on Tamil. His first work was &quot;A Catechism of Tamil Grammar&quot; (1842). His most famous work is the translation of the &quot;Tirukkural&quot; which he completed on 1 September 1886. His &quot;Sacred Kural&quot; contains introduction, grammar, translation, notes, lexicon and concordance. It also includes the English translation of F. W. Ellis and the Latin Translation of Constanzo Beschi with 436 pages. He had, by February 1893, translated &quot;Naaladiyaar&quot;, a didactic work of moral sayings in quatrains, 400 in number in 40 chapters, each by a Jain ascetic, according to a Tamil tradition. His magnum opus, the translation of &quot;Tiruvachakam&quot; appeared in 1900. Of this he said: &quot;I date this on my eightieth birthday. I find, by reference, that my first Tamil lesson was in 1837. This ends, as I suppose a long life of devotion to Tamil studies. It is not without deep emotion that I thus bring to a close my life&#x27;s literary work&quot;. He dedication this last work to Benjamin Jowett who had been a friend while serving as chaplain at Balliol College (1888).

<doc id="573209" wikidata="Q19447" url="?curid=573209" title="Thalassa (moon)">
<text>Thalassa , also known as Neptune IV, is the second-innermost satellite of Neptune. Thalassa was named after sea goddess Thalassa, a daughter of Aether and Hemera from Greek mythology. &quot;Thalassa&quot; is also the Greek word for &quot;sea&quot;.

== Discovery ==
Thalassa was discovered sometime before mid-September 1989 from the images taken by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe. It was given the temporary designation S/1989 N 5. The discovery was announced (IAUC 4867) on 29 September 1989, and mentions &quot;25 frames taken over 11 days&quot;, implying a discovery date of sometime before 18 September. The name was given on 16 September 1991.

== Physical properties ==

Thalassa is irregularly shaped. It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune&#x27;s original satellites, which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon&#x27;s capture into a very eccentric initial orbit. Unusually for irregular bodies, it appears to be roughly disk-shaped.

== Orbit ==

Since the Thalassian orbit is below Neptune&#x27;s synchronous orbit radius, it is slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune&#x27;s atmosphere, or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching. Relatively soon after, the spreading debris may impinge upon Despina&#x27;s orbit.

Thalassa is currently in a 69:73 orbital resonance with the innermost moon, Naiad, in a &quot;dance of avoidance&quot;. As it orbits Neptune, the more inclined Naiad successively passes Thalassa twice from above and then twice from below, in a cycle that repeats every ~21.5 Earth days. The two moons are about 3540 km apart when they pass each other. Although their orbital radii differ by only 1850 km, Naiad swings ~2800 km above or below Thalassa&#x27;s orbital plane at closest approach. Thus this resonance, like many such orbital correlations, stabilizes the orbits by maximizing separation at conjunction. However, the role of Naiad&#x27;s nearly 5° orbital inclination in this avoidance in a situation where eccentricities are minimal is unusual.

<text>Despina , also known as Neptune V, is the third-closest inner moon of Neptune. It is named after Greek mythological character Despoina, a nymph who was a daughter of Poseidon and Demeter.

== Discovery ==
Despina was discovered in late July 1989 from the images taken by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe. It was given the temporary designation S/1989 N 3. The discovery was announced (IAUC 4824) on 2 August 1989, and mentions &quot;10 frames taken over 5 days&quot;, implying a discovery date of sometime before July 28. The name was given on 16 September 1991.

== Physical characteristics ==
Despina&#x27;s diameter is approximately . Despina is irregularly shaped and shows no sign of any geological modification. It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune&#x27;s original satellites, which were disrupted by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon&#x27;s capture into a very eccentric initial orbit.

Compositionally, Despina appears to be similar to other small inner Neptunian satellites, with a deep 3.0 micron feature attributed to water ice or hydrated silicate minerals. It has a 0.09 albedo at 1.4 microns, 0.1 albedo at 2.0 microns, dropping to 0.03 at 3.0 microns, and increasing to 0.07 at 4.6 microns.

== Orbit ==
Despina&#x27;s orbit lies close to but outside of the orbit of Thalassa and just inside the Le Verrier ring and acts as its shepherd moon. As it is also below Neptune&#x27;s synchronous orbit radius, it is slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact Neptune&#x27;s atmosphere, or break up into a planetary ring upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching.

<text>Paul Twitchell (born Jacob Paul Twitchell; October 22, 1908 or 1909 – September 17, 1971) was an American author and spiritual teacher who created and directed the development of the new religious movement known as Eckankar. Twitchell described himself as &quot;The Mahanta, the Living ECK Master&quot; from 1965 onward. These are terms without proven historical use prior to 1965 and his usage. He also ascribed to himself the name Peddar Zaskq in his writings.

==Birth and early life==
Paul Twitchell was born in Paducah, Kentucky to Effie Dorothy and Jacob Noah Twitchell. His date of birth has been given variously between 1908 and 1922, with the Library of Congress&#x27; Name Authority File giving 1908 and a spring 1910 census suggesting 1909. Upon Twitchell&#x27;s death in 1971, his second wife Gail told the medical examiner that Paul was born on October 22, 1922, the same date presented in their marriage certificate. However, his marriage certificate with his first wife, Camille Bellowe, gave his date of birth as October 22, 1912.

Twitchell himself provided varying accounts of the circumstances of his birth. In his book &quot;The Spiritual Notebook&quot;, calling himself by his &quot;spiritual name&quot; Peddar Zaskq, Twitchell claimed to have been &quot;born on a packetboat amid the Mississippi River, a few minutes after a great earthquake shook the mid-South and formed a great lake in this region.&quot; That version echoed the tradition that a new Buddha is born
near water. In his biography &quot;In My Soul I am Free&quot;, authored by Brad Steiger, he claimed to have been born in a place called China Point, the location of which is not clear.

Following graduation from high school in Paducah, Twitchell attended Murray State Teachers College in Murray, Kentucky for two years before going to Western Kentucky State Teachers College, which he left in 1934 without having obtained a degree.

His first marriage was to Camille Ballowe, from Paducah, in Providence, Rhode Island, on August 12, 1942. He claims to have served in the United States Naval Reserve during World War II, from February 1942 until August 1945 when as Lieutenant Jg. he was honorably discharged. Twitchell became a correspondent for &quot;Our Navy&quot; magazine after the war for a short time. He later went on to become a freelance journalist, though he found success elusive.

==Eckankar==
Twitchell investigated a number of diverse spiritual movements and became an avid reader of spiritual, philosophical, religious and occult books at the library. In 1950, he joined Swami Premananda Giri&#x27;s Self-Revelation Church of Absolute Monism, an offshoot of Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s Self-Realization Fellowship. He lived on the grounds of the church, and edited its periodical, &quot;The Mystic Cross&quot;. In July 1955 Twitchell was arrested following violent fights with others living in the Swami&#x27;s compound. The Swami&#x27;s group terminated its relationship with Twitchell. A few months later his wife left him, they formally separated, and she remained in the compound for a short time. Their divorce was finalized in 1960.

Twitchell was initiated into the Surat Shabd Yoga by Kirpal Singh, Master of the Sant Mat group named &quot;Ruhani Satsang,&quot; in October 1955 in Washington, D.C. He immediately became a devoted student of Singh, acknowledged experiences during Initiation and later on wrote to his master of his appearing in Twitchell&#x27;s apartment and dictating discourses to him which he would type up and mail to Singh in New Delhi, India. By 1966 reports to Singh that Twitchell was teaching a program very similar to Sant Mat caused a serious disagreement between them which was never repaired. Weeks before Twitchell died he sent a letter to Singh denying he ever saw him as a &#x27;master,&#x27; denied that he ever received any initiation from Singh because Singh had no power to give initiation, and claiming that Twitchell&#x27;s spiritual achievements were gained years before they met. Twitchell also suggested that he never spiritually benefited from his connection with Singh.

However, in December 1963 Twitchell reportedly asked Singh to allow him to dedicate a book, &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Fang&quot;, in Singh&#x27;s name. Twitchell wanted Singh&#x27;s help to get it published and sent the manuscript for Singh&#x27;s approval. Twitchell never received a positive response from Singh and following their disagreement in 1966 he asked for its return. He published it himself in 1967.

Twitchell&#x27;s first known connection with L. Ron Hubbard (also a US Naval Reserve Officer during WW2 and pulp fiction author) was around 1950 during the Dianetics period. He again became involved in the Church of Scientology from about 1956 to 1959, becoming a member of the Church&#x27;s staff and one of the first Scientologists to achieve the status of clear it was claimed. Twitchell taught classes, audited others, wrote articles for the magazines, and other activities for Scientology. He made many long term friendships during this time with the exception of Hubbard himself who later, circa 1968, listed Twitchell and Eckankar on their suppressive persons/groups list. Hubbard described Twitchell not as &#x27;a clear&#x27;, as Twitchell always claimed, but as &#x27;aberrant&#x27;.

Moving to Seattle, Washington, in late 1960 after the death of his sister Kaydee (Katharine) in 1959, he met Gail Ann Atkinson in 1962. She was working part-time at the library, where they met, while doing an under-graduate degree. Twitchell later introduced her to the Ruhani Satsang teachings, and others, and Gail was also formally initiated by Singh in early December 1963 in San Francisco, during his second tour of the US. At the same time Twitchell relocated to San Francisco permanently. They married soon after on January 16, 1964, when Twitchell began more seriously writing and compiling materials about his new teaching, Eckankar. The first draft manuscript for &quot;The Far Country&quot; was written during this year. Twitchell also began having articles about Eckankar published in various newspapers and magazines.

In late 1964, they moved south to San Diego, where Twitchell gave his first lectures on Eckankar and what was then termed the &quot;bilocation&quot; technique, which he would later call &quot;Soul Travel.&quot; Gail quit her studies to work full-time so that Twitchell could dedicate himself to establishing Eckankar as a new business venture. In spring 1965, he began a long-term series of regular lectures and workshops on Eckankar at the California Parapsychology Foundation in San Diego and also started selling monthly &quot;Discourses&quot; to interested students. By late 1965 the Twitchells had together founded the Eckankar Corporation and Illuminated Way Press, registering both as companies in California.

It is believed it was Twitchell&#x27;s second wife who suggested that he adapt some of his spiritual education into a new religion. Twitchell said her encouragement was a spark for him to do something more with his writings. Critics state that at first Twitchell claimed his teachings were new but that he eventually referred to them as an ancient science that pre-dated all other major religious belief systems. Others say this interpretation is based on comments Twitchell made before he officially started Eckankar, when he was promoting what he called his &quot;Cliff-Hanger&quot; philosophy, which was an &quot;outsider&#x27;s&quot; view on modern society. Those were indeed his own views and ideas. However, once he launched Eckankar in October 1965, he always referred to it as being an ancient teaching. In his book &quot;Eckankar: The Key to Secret Worlds&quot;, Twitchell lays out wide-ranging examples of the teaching down through history, while also explaining his own personal experiences with his teacher, &quot;ECK master Rebazar Tarzs.&quot; The actual existence of &quot;Rebazar Tarzs,&quot; like that of other Theosophical and ECK masters, remains disputed, since there is no evidence that anyone has seen Tarzs, other than the faith claims of Twitchell and his followers. Some believe Tarzs was a persona created by Twitchell to cover his previous associations with Kirpal Singh etc., or to provide the public with the image of a personally powerful and intellectual teacher.

After founding Eckankar, Twitchell wrote and published a series of books and personal study discourses, gave talks around the world, wrote thousands of letters to students, and continued to write articles for magazines. He wrote a series of articles shortly after starting Eckankar that some critics have raised concerns about. In a series that Twitchell referred to as &quot;The Man Who Talks To God,&quot; he poked fun at gurus, including himself. He says that he wrote the series in exchange for getting a booklet printed on Eckankar, during a time when he couldn&#x27;t afford it himself. In that column he gave out spiritual advice, claiming to communicate with God about the problems of those who wrote to him. He included prophecy, predicting that the Vietnam War would end in 1968 and that Lyndon Johnson would be elected President of the United States for a second time. Many of his answers were concluded with the words &quot;I HAVE SPOKEN!&quot;

==As a writer ==
In 1984, Harold Klemp, the current spiritual leader of Eckankar—which keeps an archive of Twitchell&#x27;s writings—commented on Twitchell as a writer: &quot;He was an avid letter-writer, and he always kept a carbon copy ... At one time Paul made his living by writing for pulp magazines. He also wrote public-relations copy for the Navy... He sincerely cared about spiritual unfoldment and growth. He went through volumes of books on consciousness, a subject which was not in vogue in those days... he thrived on the study of different philosophies.&quot;

Klemp also describes Twitchell as a master compiler: &quot;The high teachings of ECK had been scattered to the four corners of the world. The different masters each had parts and pieces of it, but they attached little requirements ... You must be a vegetarian, or you have to meditate so many hours a day ... Paul gathered up the whole teaching and took the best. Though it may be strange to say, in this sense I see him as a master compiler. He gathered the golden teachings that were scattered around the world and made them readily available to us.&quot;

In &quot;Paulji, A Memoir&quot;, Patti Simpson reveals how Twitchell put her in charge of a monthly communication to students called the &quot;Mystic World&quot;. It often contained many mistakes: stories that were supposed to continue on a certain page but didn&#x27;t, stories stopping in mid-sentence, or the wrong names under pictures. Twitchell told her, &quot;You have no idea ... how much help it will be to me if you can learn how to take care of this publication for me. I have so many books to get out, and I need to spend time on them.&quot;

Twitchell told famed writer on the paranormal Brad Steiger that he expected &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Fang&quot; to be controversial, having announced that it &quot;would shake the foundation of the teachings of orthodox religions, philosophies, and metaphysical concepts.&quot;

==Allegations of plagiarism ==
In a 2006 article published in the 5 volume &quot;Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America&quot;, David C. Lane, a professor of philosophy and sociology at Mt. San Antonio College, noted that a lot of Twitchell&#x27;s Eckankar books contained lengthy passages from other authors&#x27; books without proper attribution or citation. In particular, Lane claims Twitchell&#x27;s 1966 book &quot;The Far Country&quot; plagiarizes over 400 paragraphs from the books &quot;With a Great Master in India&quot; and &quot;The Path of the Masters&quot; by Julian Johnson without any acknowledgement. Three other books of Twitchell&#x27;s, including &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Fang&quot;, &quot;Letters to Gail&quot;, and &quot;Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad&quot;, contain &quot;almost verbatim&quot; extracts from Johnson&#x27;s 1939 book &quot;The Path of the Masters&quot; according to Lane. Lane notes that Twitchell wrote in at least two publications that he considered a book edited by Johnson—&quot;Sar Bachan&quot;—to be his &quot;Bible&quot;.

Harold Klemp has responded to the plagiarism allegations by stating that Twitchell&#x27;s role was that of &quot;master compiler&quot;, saying &quot;He gathered the golden teachings that were scattered around the world and made them readily available to us.&quot; However, Surat shabda yoga and the Sikh/Hindu guru systems were already available in 1965 through groups faithful to their sources.
In 2007, a member of Eckankar&#x27;s clergy and Eckankar apologist since 1983, Doug Marman, published &quot;The Whole Truth&quot;, a biography of Paul Twitchell that disputes claims Lane made in &quot;The Making of a Spiritual Movement&quot;.
Lane has published commentary on Marman&#x27;s book, reaffirming his view that Twitchell plagiarized several authors.

Lane has also alleged that Twitchell lied about his past and tried to cover up his earlier associations. Marman has responded by presenting documentation related to Twitchell&#x27;s career and personal information.

===Sampling===
A sampling of three significant passages from Julian Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The Path of the Masters&quot; (1985–1988 pagination), appearing in Twitchell&#x27;s and Darwin Gross&#x27;s works, displays the prose which has proven appealing to Western seekers:


===Appropriated terms===
The Eckankar corporate body claims rights to a number of Indian language terms, including the following:
*EK / ECK
*Eckankar
*Mahanta
*Vairagi (Bairagi)
*Satsang

==Death==
Twitchell died of a heart attack on September 17, 1971, in Cincinnati while attending an Eckankar seminar. Despite having formulated the Eckankar doctrine of named succession, he had not in fact designated anyone as his successor and his sudden death created difficulties for the movement&#x27;s leadership group. It fell upon his widow to make the final decision, and she selected a second initiate and her current boyfriend Darwin Gross, who was himself succeeded later by Harold Klemp.

<text>The Harvey Awards are given for achievement in comic books. Named for writer-artist Harvey Kurtzman, the Harvey Awards were founded by Gary Groth in 1988, president of the publisher Fantagraphics, to be a successor to the Kirby Awards, which were discontinued in 1987.

The Harvey Awards are now nominated by the Harvey Awards Nomination Committee. The winners are selected by an open vote among comic-book professionals. The Harveys are no longer affiliated with Fantagraphics. The Harvey Awards Executive Committee is made up of unpaid volunteers, and the Awards are financed through sponsorships.
Since their inception, the awards have been hosted at a string of comic book conventions, starting at the Chicago Comicon, and subsequently moving to the Dallas Fantasy Fair, WonderCon, the Pittsburgh Comicon, the MoCCA Festival, the Baltimore Comic-Con, and currently the New York Comic Con.

== History ==
The Harvey Awards were created as an industry award voted on entirely by comics professionals (as opposed to awards such as the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Awards and the Eagle Awards, which were also voted on by fans). The new awards established several categories that were new from their predecessor the Kirby Awards, including awards for inking, lettering, coloring, and production design.

The Harvey Awards were initially sponsored by Fantagraphics, the Texas-based retailer Lone Star Comics, and the Eastern Region Comic Book Retailers Association (ERCBRA). Fantagraphics established the relationship with Harvey Kurtzman, designed the ballots, and compiled a mailing list of more than 1,000 comics professionals. Employees at Lone Star Comics were in charge of tabulating the ballots.

The nominations for the first Harvey Awards were announced in May 1988, and the awards were presented at the Chicago Comicon in July 1988.

The Dallas Fantasy Fair hosted the awards from 1989 until the Fair&#x27;s demise in 1996. The 1993 Awards presentation took place shortly after Kurtzman&#x27;s death; weekend events at the convention were geared toward raising money to keep the awards going. Because the Dallas Fantasy Fair was cancelled at the last minute in July 1996, the awards banquet/presentation was also cancelled. The awards were later mailed out to the recipients.

WonderCon hosted the awards from 1997 to 1999. The 2000–2002 awards were presented at the Pittsburgh Comicon, with Evan Dorkin serving as master of ceremonies. Jeff Smith was the keynote speaker of the 2000 awards. Frank Miller gave the keynote speech at the 2001 award ceremony, in which he vilified the comic book speculating industry, in particular &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine. He ended his speech by tearing up a copy of &quot;Wizard&quot;. Tony Millionaire gave the keynote speech at the 2002 awards ceremony. In 2003, due to a cancellation by scheduled keynote speaker Neil Gaiman, funding shortages forced the cancellation of that year&#x27;s ceremony and banquet (which had been scheduled for the Pittsburgh Comicon). The award winners were announced at the convention.

In 2004 and 2005, the presentation was held at the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art MoCCA Festival in New York City.

In 2006 the awards&#x27; presentation was moved to Baltimore Comic-Con, where it was subsequently held annually through 2016. During this era, Paul McSpadden served as the Harvey Awards administrator.

Beginning on October 7, 2017, the Harvey Award ceremony was moved to the New York Comic Con. The first year, only a small reception honoring the legacy of Harvey Kurtzman was held, and no nominations or voting took place. Darwyn Cooke was posthumously awarded Harvey Awards Hall of Fame induction, presented by Adam Kubert and accepted by Cooke&#x27;s widow Marsha.

In 2018, the 30th anniversary of the awards was celebrated with a full ceremony held during the convention. Beginning that year, the Harvey Awards were revised to six new categories for the main awards and three possible Special Awards. The main award nominations go to works instead of individuals. The nomination process was also revamped to be done by a selection committee instead of an open vote. Final selection for the main awards was still done by an open vote by industry professionals.

In 2019, the Harvey Awards gala was held on October 4, at an invite only gala in New York City during New York Comic Con. In addition to announcing the winners in the individual nominated categories, seven creators were inducting into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame including Mike Mignola and Alison Bechdel. The inclusion of an additional five creators inducted posthumously, Will Elder, Jack Davis, Marie Severin, John Severin, and Ben Oda, served to correct past omissions. In regards to these additional inductees, the &quot;New York Times&quot; quoted Harvey Awards co-chair John Lind as explaining “We decided to balance the induction class with some of the past creators who may have been overlooked.”

In October 2020, the Harvey Awards were presented during a virtual ceremony broadcast &quot;as part of New York Comic Con and MCM Comic Con’s Metaverse, hosted by Vivek Tiwary and featuring appearances from Gene Luen Yang, Neil Gaiman, Jill Thompson and Damon Lindelof&quot;.

<doc id="573216" wikidata="Q19464" url="?curid=573216" title="Galatea (moon)">
<text>Galatea , also known as Neptune VI, is the fourth-closest inner moon of Neptune, and fifth-largest moon of Neptune. It is named after Galatea, one of the fifty Nereids of Greek legend, with whom Cyclops Polyphemus was vainly in love.

== Discovery ==

Galatea was discovered in late July 1989 from the images taken by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe. It was given the temporary designation S/1989 N 4. The discovery was announced (IAUC 4824) on 2 August 1989, and mentions &quot;10 frames taken over 5 days&quot;, implying a discovery date of sometime before July 28. The name was given on 16 September 1991.

== Physical properties ==

Galatea is irregularly shaped and shows no sign of any geological modification. It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune&#x27;s original satellites, which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon&#x27;s capture into a very eccentric initial orbit.

Compositionally, Galatea appears to be similar to other small inner Neptunian satellites, with a deep 3.0 micron feature attributed to water ice or hydrated silicate minerals. It has a 0.08 albedo at 1.4 and 2.0 microns, dropping to 0.04 at 3.0 microns, and increasing to 0.12 at 4.6 microns.

== Orbit ==
Galatea&#x27;s orbit lies below Neptune&#x27;s synchronous orbit radius, so it is slowly spiralling inward due to tidal deceleration and may eventually impact the planet or break up into a new planetary ring system upon passing its Roche limit due to tidal stretching.

Galatea appears to be a shepherd moon for the Adams ring that is outside its orbit. Resonances with Galatea in the ratio 42:43 are also considered the most likely mechanism for confining the unique ring arcs that exist in this ring. Galatea&#x27;s mass has been estimated based on the radial perturbations it induces on the ring.

== Notes ==

&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Galatea is irregularly shaped, the actual surface gravity and escape velocity will vary significantly between different positions on the surface.

<text>The title [[Administrator of the government]] (Administrator) has several uses in Australia.

==Administrator of the Commonwealth==
Section 4 of the Australian Constitution provides that:

Accordingly, an administrator is appointed when the Governor-General dies, resigns or is absent from Australia. The administrator is styled either Administrator of the Commonwealth or, less commonly, Administrator of the Government of the Commonwealth. By convention, the administrator is usually the longest serving state governor, who holds a dormant commission from the sovereign (currently Charles III).

There have been four separate occasions during which a governor of one of the states has ascended to the office of Governor-General by dormant commission due to unforeseen circumstances:
*17 July 1902 – 9 January 1903; Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson, Governor of South Australia since April 1899, was appointed by Edward VII to the office after the sudden resignation of the Earl of Hopetoun. After several months acting in the position, Baron Tennyson was appointed to the office of Governor-General permanently, which is to date the only occasion on which this has occurred.
*2 October 1930 – 21 January 1931; Arthur Somers-Cocks, 6th Baron Somers, who had been the Governor of Victoria since June 1926, became Governor-General by dormant commission after the term of The Viscount Stonehaven expired and he left Australia. Sir Isaac Isaacs, the Chief Justice of Australia since April 1930, was appointed to the position permanently. Lord Somers retired as Governor of Victoria later that year.
*3 February 1961 – 3 August 1961; General Sir Dallas Brooks, Governor of Victoria since October 1949, ascended to the position by the power of a dormant commission after the death of The Viscount Dunrossil. Lord De L&#x27;Isle was appointed as Governor-General a few months later in August 1961. Brooks retired as Governor of Victoria in May 1963.
*28 May 2003 – 11 August 2003; After Peter Hollingworth announced his resignation and his commission was withdrawn by Elizabeth II, Sir Guy Green, who had been Governor of Tasmania since October 1995, assumed the position by dormant commission. Prime Minister John Howard announced his replacement, Michael Jeffery, in mid-2003, and he took office in August. Green retired as Governor of Tasmania later that year.

On 11 May 2003, the letters patent commissioning the Governor-General were amended to enable Peter Hollingworth to stand aside as Governor-General following a controversy about his past handling of child abuse allegations, and Tasmanian Governor Sir Guy Green was appointed Administrator until Hollingworth&#x27;s permanent replacement (Major General Michael Jeffery) took office on 8 August 2003.

The present longest serving state governor is Margaret Beazley who has been Governor of New South Wales since 2 May 2019.

In 2023, former governor-general Sir Peter Cosgrove was appointed as Administrator of the Government as Governor-General David Hurley and all state governors were overseas to attend the coronation of Charles III.

==Administrator of a state==
In the Australian states, when the governor dies, resigns or is absent, the lieutenant-governor (appointed by the governor on the advice of the state premier) performs the official duties of the governor as administrator until a new governor is appointed. In the absence of both a governor and lieutenant-governor, the chief of the state&#x27;s supreme court or the next most senior puisne judge, traditionally holding, ex officio, the position of lieutenant-governor, assumes his or her position as head of the executive until a governor is appointed. In 2001, the Constitution of Queensland was amended to restore the office of lieutenant-governor in that state.

==Administrator of a territory==
Unlike the Australian states, each of which is a possession of the Crown &quot;in its own right&quot; and which therefore possesses a governor directly representing the King, all Australian territories are possessions of the Crown &quot;in right of the Commonwealth of Australia&quot; and the sole &quot;direct&quot; representative of the Crown therefore remains the Commonwealth Governor-General. Unlike the states, the territories fall within the exclusive legislative and administrative competence of the Commonwealth. In respect of several territories the Governor-General is represented in the territory by an Administrator appointed to administer the territory on his or her behalf. In those territories with an Administrator, the Administrator can be considered the &quot;indirect&quot; representative of the King in the territory.

===Northern Territory===
In the Northern Territory, which is not a state and does not have a Governor, but which is self-governing with its own legislature and executive, the role of the Crown is filled by an Administrator of the Northern Territory appointed by the Governor-General-in-Council—that is, the Governor-General acting on the formal &quot;advice&quot; of the Federal Executive Council—on the &quot;recommendation&quot; of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, in accordance with the provisions of the &quot;Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 (Cth)&quot;.

===Australian Capital Territory===
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) does not have an Administrator. As in all other Australian territories, the Governor-General of the Commonwealth remains the &quot;direct&quot; constitutional representative of the Queen in the Territory; however, pursuant to the provisions of the &quot;Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cwth)&quot; there is a Territory &quot;Executive&quot; consisting of the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory and any other Ministers admitted by them to the Executive. The Crown is therefore represented by the Governor-General of Australia in the Government of the ACT. However, reserve powers analogous to those vested in a State Governor are vested by the Act in the Federal Minister for Territories, who may, for example, dissolve the ACT Assembly in cases of corruption or deadlock.

===Other Australian territories===
As well as the internal and largely self-governing territories of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, Australia also possesses (or lays claim to—since Australia&#x27;s Antarctic claims are not universally recognised) seven external territories, each of which falls within the sphere of influence of the Commonwealth and is administered by the Commonwealth Government. Three of these, Norfolk Island (which enjoys a large degree of autonomy), the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and the Territory of Christmas Island have permanent populations and also have an Administrator appointed by the Governor-General-in-Council to administer the territory on their behalf. The remaining four external territories, the Australian Antarctic Territory, the Coral Sea Islands Territory, the Territory of Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island, and the Territory of Heard and McDonald Islands have no permanent population and do not have an Administrator as such but are administered directly by the Commonwealth Government, currently under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (Australian Antarctic Territory) and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (other territories).

In addition to the two self-governing internal territories and Australia&#x27;s seven external territories, there is also the internal territory of Jervis Bay. Prior to ACT Self-Government in 1989, what is now the Jervis Bay Territory constituted part of the Australian Capital Territory. Upon ACT Self-Government it became a separate territory located on the Australian mainland; for the most part it is populated with Defence Force personnel. The territory does not have an Administrator and is administered directly by the Commonwealth Government.

==Administrator of a local government area==
In Australia, local government areas are the third tier of government in Australia administered by the states and territories, and in cases where the state government has been obliged to dismiss or suspend the operations of local government in an area, an Administrator is appointed to take the place of the elected mayor and councillors. In New South Wales, with 132 local government authorities in 2016, the powers of an Administrator are set out in Chapter 9, Part 2, Division 6 (Appointment of administrator), Sections 255-259, of the Local Government Act 1993. Prominent recent examples of NSW councils being operated by administrators include: Port Macquarie-Hastings Council (2008–2012), City of Wollongong (2008–2012), Tweed Shire (2005–2008), Warringah Council (1965–1967, 1985–1987, 2003–2008), 
Wingecarribee Shire Council (2021-present) and 
Central Coast Council (2020–2024). Tasmanian Huon Valley Council was placed in administration from 2016 until 2018.

<doc id="573227" wikidata="Q1856944" url="?curid=573227" title="Robert Drinan">
<text>Robert Frederick Drinan (November 15, 1920 – January 28, 2007) was a Jesuit priest, lawyer, human rights activist, and Democratic U.S. Representative from Massachusetts. Drinan left office to obey Pope John Paul II&#x27;s prohibition on political activity by priests.

He was also a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center for the last 26 years of his life.

==Education and legal career==
Drinan grew up in Hyde Park, Massachusetts, the son of Ann Mary (Flanagan) and James John Drinan. He graduated from Hyde Park High School in 1938. He received a B.A. and an M.A. from Boston College finishing in 1942, and joined the Society of Jesus the same year; he was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1953. He received an LL.B. and LL.M. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1950, and a doctorate in theology from Gregorian University in Rome in 1954.

Drinan studied in Florence for two years before returning to Boston, where he was admitted to the bar in 1956. He served as dean of the Boston College Law School from 1956 until 1970, during which time he also taught as a professor of family law and church-state relations. During this period he was a visiting professor at other schools including the University of Texas School of Law. He served on several Massachusetts state commissions convened to study legal issues such as judicial salaries and lawyer conflicts of interest.
==Political career==
In 1970, Drinan sought a seat in Congress on an anti-Vietnam War platform, narrowly defeating longtime Representative Philip J. Philbin, who was serving on the House Armed Services Committee, in the Democratic primary. Drinan went on to win election to the House of Representatives, and was re-elected four times, serving from 1971 until 1981. He was the first of two Catholic priests (the other being Robert John Cornell of Wisconsin) to serve as a voting member of Congress. Drinan sat on various House committees, and served as the chair of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice of the House Judiciary Committee. He was also a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention.

Drinan introduced a resolution in July 1973 calling for the impeachment of President Richard Nixon, though not for the Watergate Scandal that ultimately ended Nixon&#x27;s presidency. Drinan believed that Nixon&#x27;s secret bombing of Cambodia was illegal, and as such, constituted a &quot;high crime and misdemeanor.&quot; House Majority Leader Tip O&#x27;Neill ultimately convinced Drinan not to press the articles of impeachment further because it would have made the impeachment process against Richard Nixon emerging from the Senate Watergate Committee&#x27;s findings much more politically difficult. O&#x27;Neill subsequently assigned the house whips John J. McFall and John Brademas to tabling any vote on the resolution and reached an agreement with House Minority Leader Gerald Ford not to bring the motion to a vote. One year later, the Judiciary Committee voted 21 to 12 against including that charge among the articles of impeachment that were eventually approved and reported out to the full House of Representatives.

Throughout Drinan&#x27;s political career, his overt support of abortion rights drew significant opposition from Church leaders. They had repeatedly requested that he not hold political office. Drinan attempted to reconcile his position with official Church doctrine by stating that while he was personally opposed to abortion, considering it &quot;virtual infanticide,&quot; its legality was a separate issue from its morality. This argument failed to satisfy his critics. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Drinan played a key role in the pro-choice platform&#x27;s becoming a common stance of politicians from the Kennedy family.

In 1980, Pope John Paul II unequivocally demanded that all priests withdraw from electoral politics. Drinan complied and did not seek reelection. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; quoted Drinan&#x27;s explanation of why he did not renounce the priesthood to stay in office: 
It is just unthinkable. ... I am proud and honored to be a priest and a Jesuit. As a person of faith I must believe that there is work for me to do which somehow will be more important than the work I am required to leave.

Following his death, members of Congress honored Drinan&#x27;s memory with a moment of silence on the House floor on January 29, 2007.

==Teaching, writing, and later life==
Drinan taught at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., from 1981 to 2007, where his academic work and classes focused on legal ethics and international human rights. He privately sponsored human rights missions to countries such as Chile, the Philippines, El Salvador, and Vietnam. In 1987 he founded the Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics. He regularly contributed to law reviews and journals, and authored several books including &quot;The Mobilization of Shame: A World View of Human Rights,&quot; published by Yale University Press in 2001.

Drinan continued to be a vocal supporter of abortion rights, much to the ire of some of the Catholic hierarchy, and notably spoke out in support of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 1996. In his weekly column for the &quot;Catholic New York&quot;, Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor sharply denounced Drinan. &quot;You could have raised your voice for life; you raised it for death,&quot; the cardinal wrote, &quot;Hardly the role of a lawyer. Surely not the role of a priest.&quot;

Drinan died of pneumonia and congestive heart failure on January 28, 2007, in Washington, D.C.

Upon Drinan&#x27;s death, the Georgetown University Law Center Dean, T. Alexander Aleinikoff, made the following statement: &quot;Few have accomplished as much as Father Drinan and fewer still have done so much to make the world a better place. His passing is a terrible loss for the community, the country and the world.&quot;

John H. Garvey, Dean of the Boston College Law School, said, &quot;It is difficult to say in a few words what Father Drinan means to this institution. It is safe to say that his efforts as Dean forever changed how the Law School does business, taking us from a regional school to a nationally recognized leader in legal education. He did this without diminishing the essential core of what makes BC Law special, maintaining our commitment to educating the whole person—mind, body and spirit—while nourishing a community of learners intent on supporting one another in reaching their common goal. When we say that Boston College Law School educates &#x27;lawyers who lead good lives,&#x27; we need look no further than Father Drinan to understand what those words mean. We are forever in his debt.&quot;

Following his death, many Georgetown Law School students and faculty shared their reminiscences of Father Drinan, and wrote of his influence on their lives, on Georgetown University&#x27;s website. Georgetown Law Magazine published a special tribute supplement in Spring 2007.

==Sexual assault allegations==
In 2012, five years after Drinan&#x27;s death, &quot;Slate&quot; writer Emily Yoffe said that he had sexually assaulted her when she was &quot;a teenager of 18 or 19.&quot; Drinan&#x27;s niece responded to the allegations by calling it &quot;odd that anyone would come forward with this allegation decades later when our uncle is in no position to defend himself.&quot;

==Associations and awards==
Drinan served as a member of the American Bar Association House of Delegates until his death and was chair of the ABA Section on Individual Rights and Responsibilities. In 2004, Drinan received the ABA Medal, the organization&#x27;s highest honor for distinguished service in law. On May 10, 2006, Drinan was presented the Distinguished Service Award by then Speaker Dennis Hastert and then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on behalf of the House of Representatives. He received 21 honorary doctorates during his life.

Drinan served on the Board of Directors of People for the American Way, the International League for Human Rights, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the International Labor Rights Fund, Americans for Democratic Action, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. He was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board in 1981 and 1997. For many years he was Chairman of PeacePAC, a division of Council for a Livable World, and a Director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

The College Democrats of Boston College annually present an award in honor of Drinan to prominent Catholic Democratic figures. Past awardees include John Kerry, Donna Brazile, and Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Tim Murray.

Georgetown University Law Center awards the Robert F. Drinan, S.J., Public Service Award to alumni &quot;whose careers, like Fr. Drinan&#x27;s, enhance human dignity and advance justice.&quot;

<text>The western plantain-eater (Crinifer piscator), also known as the grey plantain-eater or western grey plantain-eater, is a large member of the turaco family, a group of large arboreal near-passerine birds restricted to Africa.

This species is a resident breeder in open woodland habitats in tropical west Africa. It lays two or three eggs in a tree platform nest.

These are common, noisy and conspicuous birds, despite lacking the brilliant colours of relatives such as the violet turaco. They are 50 cm long, including a long tail. Their plumage is mainly grey above spotted with brown. The head, erectile crest, neck and breast are brown streaked with silver. The underparts are whitish, heavily streaked with brown.


The western plantain-eater has a thick bright yellow bill and shows a white wing bar in flight. The sexes are identical, but juveniles have a black woolly head without silver streaking.

This bird is similar to the closely related eastern plantain-eater. The latter species has white tail bars, and lacks the chest bars and dark wing feather shafts of its western relative.

This species feeds on fruit, especially figs, seeds and other vegetable matter.

The Western plantain-eater has a loud &quot;cow-cow-cow&quot; call, which is very familiar in west Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The western plantain-eater was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1770 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in Senegal. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Falco piscator&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The western plantain-eater is now placed in the genus &quot;Crinifer&quot; that was erected by the Polish zoologist Feliks Paweł Jarocki in 1821. The generic name combines the Latin &quot;crinis&quot; meaning &quot;hair&quot; and &quot;-fer&quot; meaning &quot;bearing&quot;. The specific name &quot;piscator&quot; is Latin for &quot;fisherman.

The American ornithologist James L. Peters rejected the identification of Daubenton&#x27;s plate with the western plantain-eater and instead used the specific epithet &quot;africanus&quot; that had been proposed by John Latham in 1790: &quot;To recognize Daubenton&#x27;s plate as representing &quot;Phasianus africanus&quot; Latham requires more imagination than I am capable of using.&quot; The plate may instead depict the African fish eagle.

<doc id="573251" wikidata="Q1931230" url="?curid=573251" title="Airbag / How Am I Driving?">
<text>Airbag / How Am I Driving? is the fifth EP by the English rock band Radiohead, released in April 1998 in North America. It collects most of the B-sides from singles released from Radiohead&#x27;s third album, &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), plus the &quot;OK Computer&quot; song &quot;Airbag&quot;. All songs from the album appeared on the 2017 reissue &quot;OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017&quot;.

== Tracks ==
&quot;Airbag / How Am I Driving?&quot; collects most of the &quot;OK Computer&quot; B-sides, excluding &quot;Lull&quot; (from the &quot;Karma Police&quot; single) and &quot;How I Made My Millions&quot; from the &quot;No Surprises&quot; single. &quot;Meeting in the Aisle&quot; was Radiohead&#x27;s first instrumental, featuring programming by Zero 7&#x27;s Henry Binns and Sam Hardaker.

Physical copies of the EP contain a questionnaire in their liner notes, along with two short stories titled &quot;Chip Shop&quot; and &quot;New Job&quot; (presumably written by Stanley Donwood, who created the artwork for &quot;OK Computer&quot;). The questionnaire is composed of seemingly random statements.

The sample that opens &quot;A Reminder&quot; is a recording from Prague Metro&#x27;s automated announcement system: &quot;Finish getting on and getting off; the doors are closing. The next station will be Jiřího z Poděbrad.&quot; &quot;Palo Alto&quot; was tentatively titled &quot;OK Computer&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Airbag / How Am I Driving?&quot; debuted at number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 20,000 copies in its first week. Although only 25 minutes long, the EP was nominated for a 1999 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance, up against full-length albums by other artists. In 2009, the album was re-released by EMI on iTunes. &quot;Meeting in the Aisle&quot; made its live debut in 2012 on the &quot;King of Limbs&quot; tour.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Sri Lanka on 5 December 2001, just a little over a year after the previous elections in October 2000.

==Background==
The People&#x27;s Alliance (PA) government faced a blow when most of the SLMC MPs left the coalition. President Chandrika Kumaratunga tried to recruit the JVP to replace it, but this angered several PA MPs, thirteen of which defected to the opposition. A no-confidence motion was prepared; to forestall this, Kumaratunga called the election.

More than 1,300 incidents of election violence were reported during the campaign. Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake was nearly killed by a suicide bomber. Overall, 60 people were killed in election-related violence, including 14 on polling day.

==Parties==
* Democratic People&#x27;s Liberation Front (DFLP)
* Eelam People&#x27;s Democratic Party (EPDP)
* People&#x27;s Alliance (Bahejana Nidasa Pakhsaya, BNP), which consisted of:
** Communist Party of Sri Lanka
** Democratic United National Front
** Lanka Sama Samaja Party (Sri Lanka Equal Society Party, LSSP)
** Sri Lanka Freedom Party (Sri Lanka Nidahas Pakshaya, SLNP)
** Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya (Sri Lanka People&#x27;s Party, SLMP)
* Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (People&#x27;s Liberation Front, JVP)
* Sri Lanka Muslim Congress
* Tamil United Liberation Front (Tamil Vimuktasi Peramuna, TVP)
* United National Front, which consisted of:
** United National Party (Eksath Jathika Pakshaya, UNP)
** Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC)

==Results==
The ruling People&#x27;s Alliance lost the election, which saw the United National Front win the legislative power. UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe became the new prime minister.

Having the President and Prime Minister belong to two different parties proved to be unstable, and Parliament was dissolved again in 2004, leading to yet another general election.

<doc id="573266" wikidata="Q1195594" url="?curid=573266" title="Story of Seasons">
<text>Story of Seasons, known in Japan as and formerly known as Harvest Moon, is an agricultural farming life simulation video game series created by Yasuhiro Wada and developed by Victor Interactive Software (acquired by Marvelous Entertainment in 2003, now Marvelous Inc.). &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; was the first game to be released under the new international series title of the same name.

From 1996 to 2013, Natsume Inc. oversaw the English translation and distribution of the &quot;Bokujo Monogatari&quot; series in North America, where the games were released under the series title &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;. In 2014, however, Marvelous Inc. announced that the latest installment in the series would be localized by their American publishing brand Xseed Games under the new series title &quot;Story of Seasons&quot;. In 2015, Nintendo published the first game under this title in Europe, &quot;Story of Seasons&quot;.

The main objective of the series is to rebuild a dilapidated old farm and turn it into a successful one. Over a period of time, the player tends to crops and livestock, befriends nearby townsfolk, and eventually marries and starts a family. The first game in the series, &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;, was released for the Super NES in 1996.

==Naming==
In 2012, Marvelous discontinued licensing the series to Natsume Inc. Natsume Inc. took the opportunity to develop their own series of &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; in North America and Europe beginning with the release of &quot;Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley.&quot; The resulting spin-off series has caused some degree of confusion among fans and video game news sources. Natsume Inc. published this series under the name &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; until 2014. At that time, Natsume Inc. maintained the rights to the &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; series name after Marvelous announced that it would have its subsidiary, Xseed Games, take over North American distribution. Because of this, Xseed began bringing the series to North America under the &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; title, beginning with the release of the game of the same name.

In September 2015, Nintendo of Europe confirmed that they would be publishing the latest entry of the series in Europe under the &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; name. Previous games released under the series title &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; were localized in Europe by Rising Star Games.

==Common elements==

===Gameplay===
The player&#x27;s character has primarily been male, but some games offer the option to play as a female character. The most common story line of the series involves the player taking over a farm that no longer has an owner tending to it, growing crops, raising livestock, making friends with the town&#x27;s people and creating a family while running a successful farm. Each game provides objects to collect or goals to complete, whether it is befriending villagers, collecting musical notes, finding sprites, making rainbows, or ringing bells.

Money is obtained by growing crops, raising livestock, fishing, mining, and foraging. With a limited time and limited energy, the player has to find a balance between these in order to accomplish their work for the day.

====Growing crops====
Crops are the primary source of income in &quot;Story of Seasons&quot;. In order for crops to grow the player must first clear the field from weeds, rocks, boulders, branches, and stumps. Then with a clear field, they must take their hoe and till the soil. Next, they choose the seeds that they wish to grow and sow them where the soil is tilled. The player must continue to water the crop daily, but it isn&#x27;t required on a rainy day, and as time goes on the crop will be ready for harvesting. The player must find optimal planting, watering and harvesting patterns. They also must consider the cost, sell price, number of harvests and growth time of the various produce available before planting. Each season has different crops available for planting, though in most games nothing may be planted in winter, and in &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; crops could not be planted in fall. In some games, a greenhouse or basement can be used during the winter to grow crops.

Turnips, potatoes, tomatoes and corn are staple crops of the series, introduced in the first game. Since then, other games have introduced new crops, such as cabbage, carrots, onions, strawberries, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, rice, pineapples, cucumbers and more. Grass may also be grown and harvested as animal fodder.

====Ranching livestock====
The secondary source of income in the games is purchasing, caring for, and raising livestock. Livestock may produce products which may be sold on a daily basis. Giving animals attention will increase their affection towards the player and may increase the quality of their products. Neglecting the animals&#x27; needs may lead to sickness and even death.

The first &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; only had cows and chickens, which were housed in a barn and chicken coop and fed the same fodder. Milk and eggs could both be sold, as well as the animals themselves. Later titles introduced sheep and a separate feed for chickens, as well as machines that could change milk into cheese, eggs into mayonnaise, and wool into yarn. The more recent games allow the player to also raise ducks, goats, alpacas and differently-colored cows. In &quot;Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility&quot; silkworms and ostriches were introduced to the series, and the new game also enabled players to befriend wild animals and persuade them to live on their farm.

Animals are also able to reproduce. Eggs can be placed in an incubator to hatch a chick in a few days, while giving a cow or sheep a Miracle Potion will impregnate them. Buying and breeding multiple horses was introduced in &quot;Harvest Moon 3 GBC&quot; for Game Boy Color and continued in &quot;Harvest Moon: Magical Melody&quot;, &quot;Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility&quot; and &quot;Harvest Moon: Animal Parade&quot;.

====Pets and other animals====
In many &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; games, the player is given the opportunity to receive a dog and horse as a pet. A large variety of animals can be kept as pets in the newer titles, from pigs and cats to pandas and turtles. In some games, the pets attend competitions (e.g. horse races and dog races) to win prizes. In &quot;Harvest Moon: Back to Nature&quot; the player can raise fish.

Pest animals are also found in older &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; games (for example, &quot;Friends of Mineral Town&quot;) including wild dogs, and gophers. Wild dogs visit the farm at night and harass any livestock not kept in a barn or fenced area. Gophers in some older titles would consume crops.

====Gathering materials====
Many &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; games require the player to gather materials for home improvement, tool improvement, cooking, or selling. The most common building resource in &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; is wood; other resources can include stone and golden lumber. The player can gather wood by chopping tree stumps and branches, and use wood to add buildings or fencing to their farm. Mines are present in many games, and minerals gathered can be used for upgrading tools and crafting gifts. In many games wild plants, such as herbs and flowers, may also be gathered.

====Festivals====
Most games in the series feature annual festivals which the player can attend. Some festivals are contests with prizes available, while others are social events, some being equivalent to actual holidays, such as Thanksgiving, New Year&#x27;s Day, and Christmas Eve. Livestock festivals also take place, where the player can submit their animals to compete against other farms. Animals that win these contests often receive benefits; for example, a cow that wins might gain the ability to produce gold milk.

====Marriage====
Most &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; games offer the ability to marry. Gift giving and interacting with the love interest may increase the love interest&#x27;s affection, and if their affection is high enough marriage may be proposed. Often, the proposal is made with a Blue Feather. In some games, love interests have rivals, who will marry them if the player does not. One &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; game, the Japanese version of &quot;Harvest Moon DS Cute&quot;, had allowed players to marry someone of the same sex (termed the &quot;Best Friends&quot; system). The feature was removed from the North American version over concern its inclusion would have raised the game&#x27;s ESRB rating.

In the remake game &quot;Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town&quot;, players are allowed to marry someone of the same sex. In the Western release, it is treated identically to opposite-sex couples. However, in the Japanese release, it is not referred to as marriage proper and instead brings back the &quot;Best Friends&quot; title.

====Children====
In many versions, it is possible to have children. &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;, &quot;Harvest Moon 3&quot;, &quot;Harvest Moon: Animal Parade&quot;, &quot;Rune Factory 3&quot;, &quot;Story of Seasons&quot;, and &quot;Rune Factory 5&quot; are the only versions where the player can have multiple children. However, in &quot;Story of Seasons&quot;, unlike the other games, pregnancy is only experienced once, as the player character winds up having twins. &quot;Harvest Moon: Animal Parade&quot; is the first game in the series that allows the player to have two children of either gender, and &quot;Rune Factory 3&quot; allows the player to have three children of either gender. &quot;Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life&quot;, &quot;Harvest Moon DS&quot; and &quot;Harvest Moon DS Cute&quot; are the only games in the series where the player can experience a child&#x27;s growth from toddler to full-grown adult. &quot;Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility&quot; expands on this by letting the player restart the game as their child after the completion of an end game event. &quot;Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland&quot;, &quot;Harvest Moon GB&quot;, &quot;Harvest Moon 2 GBC&quot; and &quot;Innocent Life: A Futuristic Harvest Moon&quot; are the only &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; titles in which the player cannot marry. &quot;Rune Factory 2&quot; is the only &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; where the player can personify two characters, the father and his son or daughter.

==List of games==
==Reception==
In September 2011, Rising Star Games announced that they had sold more than a million copies of the series in PAL regions. In Japan, the DS games in the series had sold more than 948,000 copies alone by April 2011, with the PSP games selling over 81,000 in the same time period. &quot;The Tale of Two Towns&quot; reached No. 4 in the Japan Software and Hardware Weekly Chart, shipping 63,610 copies in its first week on sale. In March 2014, &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; was the top selling game in Japan, at 131,000 units sold, and in July 2015, Xseed Games announced that it had become their fastest-selling game ever, with over 100,000 copies sold in North America.

==Legacy==
Over the years, &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; has been called a &quot;pioneer&quot; in its genre.

It has inspired a large number of social network games based around farming, most notably &quot;Happy Farm&quot; (2008) and &quot;FarmVille&quot; (2009). &quot;Happy Farm&quot; is considered one of the most influential games of the 2000s, while in early 2010 &quot;FarmVille&quot; had a peak audience of 84 million monthly active users. In 2009, Marvelous Entertainment released a version of &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;, called , for the Japanese social network site Mixi, where it attracted 2.3 million users. Other similar farming social network games released in 2009 and 2010 include &quot;Sunshine Farm&quot;, &quot;Happy Farmer&quot;, &quot;Happy Fishpond&quot;, &quot;Happy Pig Farm&quot;, &quot;Farm Town&quot;, &quot;Country Story&quot;, &quot;Barn Buddy&quot;, &quot;Sunshine Ranch&quot;, and &quot;Happy Harvest&quot;, as well as parodies such as &quot;Farm Villain&quot;.

The developer of &quot;Stardew Valley&quot;, Eric Barone, has mentioned several times he was inspired by &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; when developing his game. Given the recent growing popularity of the farming and life simulation genres, most notably in the indie game scene, both &quot;Story of Seasons&quot; and &quot;Stardew Valley,&quot; along with the &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; series, have been regarded as the foundation of this &quot;new golden era&quot; for the genre.

<doc id="573267" wikidata="Q785815" url="?curid=573267" title="Harvest Moon (album)">
<text>Harvest Moon is the 21st studio album by Canadian-American musician Neil Young, released on November 2, 1992. Many of its backing musicians also appeared on Young&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Harvest&quot;.

==Background==
Recovering from a case of tinnitus that had come about after the recording of &quot;Ragged Glory&quot; (1990) and its subsequent tour (which produced the 1991 albums &quot;Weld&quot; and &quot;Arc&quot;), Young returned to the studio with Ben Keith, picking up the acoustic guitar, piano and banjo that had dominated albums such as &quot;Harvest&quot;, &quot;Comes a Time&quot; and &quot;Old Ways&quot;. 1970s-era analogue equipment was used instead of digital recording to achieve a &quot;warmer&quot; feel, though the board used was Sony PCM 16/44.1 kHz digital.

The album&#x27;s title and style drew comparisons to Young&#x27;s 1972 career pinnacle &quot;Harvest&quot;. Young discussed the idea of making a follow up to &quot;Harvest&quot; in a 1992 Rolling Stone interview with Alan Light: &quot;People had been asking me to do it for twenty years, and I never could figure out what it was in the first place. It just happened again, whatever it was that happened back then. But only because the songs made me do it.&quot;

==Writing==
Like many of the songs on its predecessor &quot;Harvest&quot;, the songs are largely inspired by relationships. This time, much of the lyrics reflect the maturer perspective of a long-term partnership. Some of the songs are new compositions, while others revisit material Young had first worked on during the previous decade. He explains in a contemporary interview: 

&quot;Unknown Legend&quot; is a portrait of Young&#x27;s wife Pegi, whom he met working at a diner in 1974. He began writing the song in the mid-1970s but did not complete the song until fifteen years later. Young remembers in his memoir, &quot;Special Deluxe&quot;: Photographer and archivist Joel Bernstein helped bring the song back to Young&#x27;s attention: &quot;Unknown Legend&quot; actually was a song Joel brought me; he kept bringing me the lyrics and saying, &#x27;What is this thing?&#x27; I said, It&#x27;s a song I started back in &#x27;82. I don&#x27;t think I ever finished it.&#x27; He kept bringing it back to me, and one day I picked up my guitar and finished it right there. But that doesn&#x27;t happen very often with me. The real good ones come right away, just in one sitting.&quot;

&quot;From Hank to Hendrix&quot; uses cultural references to measure time in a relationship. Young recalls the process of writing the song in a contemporary interview: &quot;I wrote the song in my house. I sat down with my 12 string guitar and just started playing and writing all at once. I don&#x27;t think about it. I just do it. I don&#x27;t think &#x27;now I&#x27;m going to sit down and write a song&#x27; and then sit down and try to write a song. I didn&#x27;t know I was going to write a song when I sat down. I&#x27;ll pick up my guitar and start playing and then suddenly I am playing a new song. I&#x27;ve learned to realize when I&#x27;m writing and then remember what I&#x27;m doing.&quot;

The genesis of &quot;You and Me&quot; dates from the &quot;Harvest&quot; era. The chorus was first performed during the intro to &quot;I Am a Child&quot; at a February 1971 solo acoustic concert at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. Young explains: &quot;That song was started in 1975, but I never finished it. In 1976, Tim Drummond heard it and said: &#x27;You&#x27;ve got to finish that, man. That&#x27;s like Harvest stuff, let&#x27;s do that.&#x27; And that kinda freaked me out, I got spooked by it, because it was like someone said what it was before we did it. I don&#x27;t want to feel like I&#x27;m just filling in the numbers.&quot;

&quot;Harvest Moon&quot; celebrates a lasting relationship. In a 2021 post to the Neil Young Archives website, Young confirms that the song is about his marriage with Pegi: &quot;Harvest Moon is a song I wrote for Pegi, my wife of many years, who gave me two beautiful children and helped bring up my first child Zeke. She was a dancer and floated around when she was happy.&quot;

The song &quot;Old King&quot; memorializes Neil&#x27;s dog Elvis.

The lyrics to &quot;Natural Beauty&quot; simultaneously celebrate both a woman&#x27;s beauty and the beauty of nature. The track was recorded live with later overdubs. Young tells &quot;NME&quot; in a contemporary interview: 

==Recording==
The album was recorded in late September, 1991 at the Redwood Digital studio located in a barn on Young&#x27;s ranch in Woodside, California. For the album, Young convened the group of musicians that had backed him on the previous albums &quot;Harvest&quot; and &quot;Comes a Time&quot;. The group, dubbed the Stray Gators, includes pedal steel guitarist Ben Keith, bassist Tim Drummond, drummer Kenny Buttrey and pianist Spooner Oldham, as well as vocalists Nicolette Larson, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor. Young&#x27;s half-sister Astrid Young also sings on the album. Jack Nitzsche arranged an 18 piece string section for the track &quot;Such a Woman&quot;. For the album, Young sought to re-create an echoed sound that he had achieved at Sunset Sound while recording &quot;I Believe in You&quot; and &quot;Oh, Lonesome Me&quot; for &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;.

==Promotion==
In 1992, Young toured North America playing a solo acoustic set featuring songs from the album as well as from his back catalogue. A compilation of performances from the tour was released on the 2009 &quot;Dreamin&#x27; Man&quot; live album, containing solo renditions of each of the &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; tracks in a different order. Young would also record a set for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, which was released as an album in 1993.

==Reception==
Music website &quot;Classic Rock Review&quot; named &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; its album of the year for 1992. It earned the 1994 Juno Award for album of the year. Matthew Greenwald of AllMusic described the melody of the title track as &quot;positively gorgeous&quot;. The album continued Young&#x27;s commercial and critical resurgence following &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;Ragged Glory&quot;, eventually outselling both of those records. The song &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; topped the AARP&#x27;s list of &quot;16 Songs Everyone Over 50 Should Own.&quot;

<doc id="573270" wikidata="Q879704" url="?curid=573270" title="Javanese script">
<text>Javanese script (natively known as &quot;Aksara Jawa&quot;, &quot;Hanacaraka&quot;, &quot;Carakan&quot;, and &quot;Dentawyanjana&quot;) is one of Indonesia&#x27;s traditional scripts developed on the island of Java. The script is primarily used to write the Javanese language and has also been used to write several other regional languages such as Sundanese and Madurese, the regional lingua franca Malay, as well as the historical languages Kawi and Sanskrit. It heavily influenced the Balinese script from which the writing system for Sasak developed. Javanese script was actively used by the Javanese people for writing day-to-day and literary texts from at least the mid-16th century CE until the mid-20th century CE, before it was gradually supplanted by the Latin alphabet. Today, the script is taught in the Yogyakarta Special Region as well as the provinces of Central Java and East Java as part of the local curriculum, but with very limited function in everyday use.

Javanese script is an abugida writing system which consists of 20 to 33 basic letters, depending on the language being written. Like other Brahmic scripts, each letter (called an &quot;aksara&quot;) represents a syllable with the inherent vowel /a/ or /ɔ/ which can be changed with the placement of diacritics around the letter. Each letter has a conjunct form called &quot;pasangan&quot;, which nullifies the inherent vowel of the previous letter. Traditionally, the script is written without spaces between words (&quot;scriptio continua&quot;) but is interspersed with a group of decorative punctuation.

==History==
Javanese script&#x27;s evolutionary history can be traced fairly well because significant amounts of inscriptional evidence left behind allowed for epigraphical studies to be carried out. The oldest root of Javanese script is the Tamil-Brahmi script which evolved into the Pallava script in Southern and Southeast Asia between the 6th and 8th centuries. The Pallava script, in turn, evolved into Kawi script, which was actively used throughout Indonesia&#x27;s Hindu-Buddhist period between the 8th and 15th centuries. In various parts of Indonesia, Kawi script would then evolve into Indonesia&#x27;s various traditional scripts, one of them being Javanese script. The modern Javanese script seen today evolved from Kawi script between the 14th and 15th centuries, a period in which Java began to receive significant Islamic influence.

From the 15th until the mid-20th centuries, Javanese script was actively used by the Javanese people for writing day-to-day and literary texts spanning a wide range of themes. Javanese script was used throughout the island at a time when there was no easy means of communication between remote areas and no impulse towards standardization. As a result, there is a huge variety of historical and local styles of Javanese writing throughout the ages. The great differences between regional styles make the &quot;Javanese script&quot; appear like a family of scripts. Javanese writing traditions were especially cultivated in the Kraton environment in Javanese cultural centers, such as Yogyakarta and Surakarta. However, Javanese texts are known to be made and used by various layers of society with varying usage intensities between regions. In West Java, for example, the script was mainly used by the Sundanese nobility (&quot;ménak&quot;) due to the political influence of the Mataram kingdom. However, most Sundanese people within the same time period more commonly used the Pegon script which was adapted from the Arabic alphabet. Javanese writing tradition also relied on periodic copying due to the deterioration of writing materials in the tropical Javanese climate; as a result, many physical manuscripts that are available now are 18th or 19th century copies, though their contents can usually be traced to far older prototypes.

==Media==

Javanese script has been written with numerous media that have shifted over time. Kawi script, which is ancestral to Javanese script, is often found on stone inscriptions and copper plates. Everyday writing in Kawi was done in palm leaf form (ocally known as &quot;lontar&quot;), which are processed leaves of the tal palm (&quot;Borassus flabellifer&quot;). Each &quot;lontar&quot; leaf has the shape of a slim rectangle 2.8 to 4 cm in width and varies in length between 20 and 80 cm. Each leaf can only accommodate around 4 lines of writing, which are incised horizontally with a small knife and then blackened with soot to increase readability. This media has a long history of attested use all over South and Southeast Asia.

In the 13th century, paper began to be used in the Malay Archipelago. This introduction is related to the spread of Islam in the region, since Islamic writing traditions were supported by the use of paper and codex manuscript. As Java began to receive significant Islamic influence in the 15th century, coinciding with the period in which Kawi script began to transition into the modern Javanese script, paper became widespread in Java while the use of &quot;lontar&quot; only persisted in a few regions. There are two kinds of paper that are commonly used in Javanese manuscript: locally produced paper called &quot;daluang&quot;, and imported paper. &quot;Daluang&quot; (also spelled &quot;dluwang&quot;) is a paper made from the beaten bark of the &quot;saéh&quot; tree (&quot;Broussonetia papyrifera&quot;). Visually, &quot;daluang&quot; can be easily differentiated from regular paper by its distinctive brown tint and fibrous appearance. A well made &quot;daluang&quot; has a smooth surface and is quite durable against manuscript damage commonly associated with tropical climates, especially insect damage. Meanwhile, a coarse &quot;daluang&quot; has a bumpy surface and tends to break easily. &quot;Daluang&quot; is commonly used in manuscripts produced by Javanese &quot;kraton&quot; (palaces) and &quot;pesantren&quot; (Islamic boarding schools) between the 16th and 17th centuries.

Most imported paper in Indonesian manuscripts came from Europe. In the beginning, only a few scribes were able to use European paper due to its high price—paper made using European methods at the time could only be imported in limited numbers. In colonial administration, the use of European paper had to be supplemented with Javanese &quot;daluang&quot; and imported Chinese paper until at least the 19th century. As the paper supply increased due to growing imports from Europe, scribes in palaces and urban settlements gradually opted to use European paper as the primary medium for writing, while &quot;daluang&quot; paper was increasingly associated with &quot;pesantren&quot; and rural manuscripts. Alongside the increase of European paper supply, attempts to create Javanese printing type began, spearheaded by several European figures. With the establishment of printing technology in 1825, materials in Javanese script could be mass-produced and became increasingly common in various aspects of pre-independence Javanese life, from letters, books, and newspapers, to magazines, and even advertisements and paper currency.

==Usage==

From the 15th century until the mid-20th century, Javanese script was used by all layers of Javanese society for writing day-to-day and literary texts with a wide range of theme and content. Due to the significant influence of oral tradition, reading in pre-independence Javanese society was usually a performance; Javanese literature texts are almost always composed in metrical verses that are designed to be recited, thus Javanese texts are not only judged by their content and language, but also by the merit of their melody and rhythm during recitation sessions. Javanese poets are not expected to create new stories and characters; instead the role of the poet is to rewrite and recompose existing stories into forms that cater to local taste and prevailing trends. As a result, Javanese literary works such as the &quot;Cerita Panji&quot; do not have a single authoritative version referenced by all others; instead, the &quot;Cerita Panji&quot; is a loose collection of numerous tales with various versions bound together by the common thread of the Panji character. Literature genres with the longest attested history are Sanskrit epics such as the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, which have been recomposed since the Kawi period and introduced hundreds of familiar characters in Javanese wayang stories today, including Arjuna, Srikandi, Ghatotkacha and many others. Since the introduction of Islam, characters of Middle-Eastern provenance such as Amir Hamzah and the Prophet Joseph have also been frequent subjects of writing. There are also local characters, usually set in Java&#x27;s semi-legendary past, such as Prince Panji, Damar Wulan, and Calon Arang.

When studies of Javanese language and literature began to attract European attention in the 19th century, an initiative to create a Javanese movable type began to take place in order to mass-produce and quickly disseminate Javanese literary materials. One of the earliest attempts to create a movable Javanese type was by Paul van Vlissingen. His typeface was first put in use in the &quot;Bataviasche Courant&quot; newspaper&#x27;s October 1825 issue. While lauded as a considerable technical achievement, many at the time felt that Vlissingen&#x27;s design was a coarse copy of the fine Javanese hand used in literary texts, and so this early attempt was further developed by numerous other people to varying degrees of success as the study of Javanese developed over the years. In 1838, Taco Roorda completed his typeface, known as Tuladha Jejeg, based on the hand of Surakartan scribes with some European typographical elements mixed in. Roorda&#x27;s font garnered positive feedback and soon became the main choice to print any Javanese text. From then, reading materials in printed Javanese using Roorda&#x27;s typeface became widespread among the Javanese populace and were widely used in materials other than literature. The establishment of print technology gave rise to a printing industry which, for the next century, produced various materials in printed Javanese, from administrative papers and school books, to mass media such as the magazine which was entirely printed in Javanese in all of its articles and columns. In government administration, Javanese script was part of the multilingual legal text on the Netherlands Indies gulden banknotes circulated by the Bank of Java.

===Decline===
As literacy rates and the demand for reading materials increased at the beginning of the 20th century, Javanese publishers paradoxically began to decrease the amount of Javanese script publication due to a practical and economic consideration: printing any text in Javanese script at the time required twice the amount of paper compared to the same text rendered in the Latin alphabet, making Javanese texts more expensive and time-consuming to produce. In order to lower production costs and keep book prices affordable to the general populace, many publishers (such as the government-owned Balai Pustaka) gradually prioritized publications in the Latin alphabet. However, the Javanese population at the time maintained the use of Javanese script in various aspects of everyday life. It was, for example, considered more polite to write a letter using Javanese script, especially one addressed toward an elder or superior. Many publishers, including Balai Pustaka, continued to print books, newspapers, and magazines in Javanese script due to sufficient, albeit declining, demand. The use of Javanese script only started to drop significantly during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies beginning in 1942. Some writers attribute this sudden decline to prohibitions issued by the Japanese government banning the use of native script in the public sphere, though no documentary evidence of such a ban has yet been found. Nevertheless, the use of Javanese script did decline significantly during the Japanese occupation and it never recovered its previous widespread use in post-independence Indonesia.

===Contemporary use===
In contemporary usage, Javanese script is still taught as part of the local curriculum in Yogyakarta, Central Java, and the East Java Province. Several local newspapers and magazines have columns written in Javanese script, and the script can frequently be seen on public signage. However, many contemporary attempts to revive Javanese script are symbolic rather than functional; there are no longer, for example, periodicals like the &quot;Kajawèn&quot; magazine that publish significant content in Javanese script. Most Javanese people today know the existence of the script and recognize a few letters, but it is rare to find someone who can read and write it meaningfully. Therefore, as recently as 2019, it is not uncommon to see Javanese script signage in public places with numerous misspellings and basic mistakes. Several hurdles in revitalizing the use of Javanese script includes information technology equipment that does not support correct rendering of Javanese script, lack of governing bodies with sufficient competence to consult on its usage, and lack of typographical explorations that may intrigue contemporary viewers. Nevertheless, attempts to revive the script are still being conducted by several communities and public figures who encourage the use of Javanese script in the public sphere, especially with digital devices.

==Letters==

Javanese script contains around 45 letters. Over the course of its development, some letters have become obsolete and are only used in certain contexts. As such, it is common to divide the letters in several groups based on their function.

=== Consonants and basic syllables ===
A basic letter in Javanese script is called an which represents a syllable. The () are consonant letters with an inherent vowel, either /a/ or /ɔ/. As a Brahmi-derived script, Javanese script originally had 33 letters to write the 33 consonants found in Sanskrit and Kawi.


The modern Javanese script only uses 20 consonants and 20 basic letters known as . Modern Javanese script is commonly arranged in the &quot;hanacaraka&quot; sequence, a pangram whose name is derived from its first five letters, similar to the word &quot;alphabet&quot; which comes from the first two letters of the Greek alphabet, &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beta&quot;. This sequence has been used at least the 15th century, when the island of Java started to receive significant Islamic influence. There are numerous interpretations on the supposed philosophical and esoteric qualities of the &quot;hanacaraka&quot; sequence, and it is often linked to the myth of Aji Saka.

=== Vowels and vowel diacritics ===
Javanese vowel letters can be used to represent independent or word-initial vowels. A vowel sound following a consonant is written by adding a diacritic, or dependent form of a vowel to a basic syllable (), which modifies the letter&#x27;s inherent vowel sound. Vowel diacritics are known as &quot;sandhangan swara&quot; (). Conventionally, a word-initial vowel is written by adding the appropriate diacritics to , which serves as a null consonant, but in modern spelling, the independent vowels may also be used, especially to disambiguate whether should be aspirated.

As with the &quot;wyanjana&quot; letters, the modern Javanese language does not use the whole inventory of vowels. 
Only short vowels and vowel diacritics are taught and used in contemporary Javanese, while long vowels and their diacritics are used in Sanskrit and Kawi. 

===Syllabic consonants===
&quot;Pa cerek&quot; , &quot;pa cerek dirgha&quot; , &quot;nga lelet&quot; , and &quot;nga lelet raswadi&quot; are syllabic consonants that are primarily used in Sanskrit. When adapted to other languages, the function and pronunciation of these letters tend to vary. In modern Javanese, &quot;pa cerek&quot; and &quot;nga lelet&quot; are mandatory shorthand for combinations of &quot;ra + e&quot; and &quot;la + e&quot; . Both letters are usually re-categorized into their own class called &quot;aksara gantèn&quot; in modern tables. 
=== Closed syllables ===
Closed syllables are written by adding diacritics to base syllables ().

==== Semivowels and their diacritics ====
Consonant clusters containing a semivowel are written by adding a diacritic () to the base syllable. 
=== Conjunct consonants ===
The inherent vowel of each basic letter can be suppressed with the use of the virama, natively known as &quot;pangkon&quot;. However, the &quot;pangkon&quot; is not normally used in the middle of a word or sentence. For closed syllables in such positions, a conjunct form called &quot;pasangan&quot; (ꦥꦱꦔꦤ꧀) is used instead. Every basic letter has a &quot;pasangan&quot; counterpart, and if a &quot;pasangan&quot; is attached to a base letter, the inherent vowel of the attached letter is nullified. 

===Murda and mahaprana===

Some of the original letters that originally represented sounds absent in modern Javanese have been repurposed as honorific letters () which are used for in writing the respected personal names of respected figures, be they legendary, such as or real, such as . Of the 20 basic letters, only nine have corresponding &quot;murda&quot; forms. Because of this, the use of &quot;murda&quot; is not identical to the capitalization of proper names. If the first syllable of a name does not have a &quot;murda&quot; form, the next syllable that does can be written as a &quot;murda&quot;. Highly respected names may be written completely in &quot;murda&quot;, or with as many &quot;murda&quot; as possible, but in essence, the use of &quot;murda&quot; is optional and may be inconsistent in traditional texts. For example, the name &quot;Gani&quot; can be spelled as (without &quot;murda&quot;), (with a &quot;murda&quot; on the first syllable), or with every syllable as a &quot;murda&quot;. 


The remaining letters that are not classified as &quot;nglegéna&quot; or repurposed as &quot;murda&quot; are &quot;aksara mahaprana&quot;, letters that are used in Sanskrit and Kawi texts but obsolete in modern Javanese.

===Additional letters in loan words ===
Javanese script includes a number of additional letters used to write sounds found in words found in loanwords (). These letters were initially developed to write Arabic loanwords, later adapted to write Dutch loanwords, and in contemporary usage are also used to write Indonesian and English loanwords. Most &quot;rékan&quot; letters are formed by adding the &quot;cecak telu&quot; diacritic to the letters that are considered closest-sounding to the foreign sound in question. For example, (fa) is formed by adding a &quot;cecak telu&quot; diacritic to (pa). The combination of &quot;wyanjana&quot; letter and corresponding foreign sounds for each &quot;rékan&quot; may be different between sources.

=== Numerals ===
Javanese script has its own numerals () that behave similarly to Arabic numerals. However, most Javanese numerals has the exact same glyph as several basic letters, for example the numeral 1 ꧑ and &quot;wyanjana&quot; letter ga ꦒ, or the numeral 8 ꧘ and &quot;murda&quot; letter pa ꦦ. To avoid confusion, numerals that are used in the middle of sentences must be surrounded by &quot;pada pangkat&quot; or &quot;pada lingsa&quot; . For example, &quot;tanggal 17 Juni&quot; (&quot;the date 17 June&quot;) is written
or .

=== Punctuation ===
Traditional Javanese texts are written with no spaces between words (&quot;scriptio continua&quot;) with several punctuation marks called &quot;pada&quot; (ꦥꦢ).

In contemporary teaching, the most frequently used punctuations are &quot;pada adeg-adeg&quot;, &quot;pada lingsa&quot;, and &quot;pada lungsi&quot;, which are used to open paragraphs (similar to pillcrows), separating sentences (similar to commas), and ending sentences (similar to full stops). &quot;Pada adeg&quot; and &quot;pada pisélèh&quot; may be used to indicate insertion in the middle of sentences similar to parentheses or quotation marks, while &quot;pada pangkat&quot; has a similar function to the colon. &quot;Pada rangkap&quot; is sometimes used as an iteration mark for reduplicated words (for example &quot;kata-kata&quot; ꦏꦠꦏꦠ → &quot;kata2&quot; ꦏꦠꧏ)

Several punctuation marks do not have Latin equivalents and are often decorative in nature with numerous variant shapes, for example the &quot;rerenggan&quot; which is sometimes used to enclose titles. In epistolary usage, several punctuations are used in the beginning of letters and may also be used to indicate the social status of the letter writer; from the lowest &quot;pada andhap&quot;, to middle &quot;pada madya&quot;, and the highest &quot;pada luhur&quot;. &quot;Pada guru&quot; is sometimes used as a neutral option without social connotation, while &quot;pada pancak&quot; is used to end a letter. However this is a generalized function. In practice, similar to &quot;rerenggan&quot; these epistolary punctuation marks are often decorative and optional with various shape used in different regions and by different scribes.
When errors occurred during manuscript copying, several Kraton scribes used special correction marks instead of crossing out the erroneous parts: &quot;tirta tumétès&quot; normally found in Yogyakarta manuscripts, and &quot;isèn-isèn&quot; found in Surakarta manuscripts. These correction marks are directly applied following the erroneous part before the scribe continued writing. For example, if a scribe wanted to write &quot;pada luhur&quot; ꦥꦢꦭꦸꦲꦸꦂ but accidentally wrote &quot;pada hu&quot; ꦥꦢꦲꦸ before realizing the mistake, this word may be corrected into &quot;pada hu···luhur&quot; ꦥꦢꦲꦸ꧞꧞꧞ꦭꦸꦲꦸꦂ or ꦥꦢꦲꦸ꧟꧟꧟ꦭꦸꦲꦸꦂ.
=== &quot;Pepadan&quot; ===
Other than the regular punctuation, one of Javanese texts&#x27; distinctive characteristics is &quot;pepadan&quot; (), a series of highly ornate verse marks.

The series of punctuation marks that forms &quot;pepadan&quot; have numerous names in traditional texts. Behrend (1996) divides &quot;pepadan&quot; into two general groups: the minor &quot;pada&quot; which consist of a single mark, and the major &quot;pada&quot; which are composed of several marks. Minor &quot;pada&quot; are used to indicate divisions of poetic stanzas, which usually appear every 32 or 48 syllables depending on the poetic metre. Major &quot;pada&quot; are used to demarcate a change of canto (which includes a change of the metre, rhythm, and mood of the recitation) occurring every 5 to 10 pages, though this may vary considerably depending on the structure of the text. Javanese guides often list three kinds of major &quot;pada&quot;: &quot;purwa pada&quot; which is used in the beginning of the first canto, &quot;madya pada&quot; which is used in between different cantos, and &quot;wasana pada&quot; which is used in the end of the final canto. But due to the large variety of shapes between manuscripts, these three punctuations are essentially treated as a single punctuation in most Javanese manuscripts.

&quot;Pepadan&quot; is one of the most prominent elements in a typical Javanese manuscript and they almost always highly decorative, incorporating calligraphy, coloring, and even gilding. In luxurious royal manuscripts, the shape of the &quot;pepadan&quot; may even contain visual puns that gave clues to the readers regarding the canto of the text; a &quot;pepadan&quot; with wings or bird figure resembling a crow (called &quot;dhandhang&quot; in Javanese) indicates the &quot;dhandhanggula&quot; metre, while &quot;pepadan&quot; with elements of a goldfish indicates the &quot;maskumambang&quot; metre (literally &quot;gold floating on water&quot;). One of the scribal centers with the most elaborate and ornate &quot;pepadan&quot; is the scriptorium of Pakualaman in Yogyakarta.

==Sample text==
Excerpt from the &quot;Treatise on Cats&quot; (), printed in 1871 with modern Javanese language and spelling.
;Javanese script
;Romanized
;English
A completely black cat with a white patch on its left belly is called &quot;Harvest Moon&quot;. It is a cat that brings good fortune and the fulfilment of all wishes. It is better if it is bobtailed.
A dark striped cat with a long tail should not be kept as a pet. Such a cat is called &quot;Mourning Crow&quot;. You would encounter frequent arguments and limited wealth. But if it is bobtailed, then there is no problem.

==Comparison with Balinese==
The closest relative to Javanese script is the Balinese script. As direct descendants of Kawi script, Javanese and Balinese still retain many similarities in terms of basic glyph shape for each letter. One noticeable difference between both scripts is in their orthography: modern Balinese orthography is more conservative in nature than its modern Javanese counterpart.
* Modern Balinese retains Sanskrit and Kawi conventions that are no longer used in modern Javanese. For example, the word &quot;désa&quot; (village) is written in Javanese as . In Balinese, as a Sanskrit loanword, it retains its original spelling: &quot;déśa&quot; . One reason for this spelling practice is to differentiate homophones in writing.
* Javanese spelling uses &quot;aksara murda&quot;, or honorific letters, while Balinese does not.

==Usage in other languages==
===Sundanese===
Cacarakan (), a version of Javanese script tailored to the Sundanese language, was officially used from the 16th to 20th centuries. Today, there are still several places which use . Sundanese spelling has several differences from Javanese.
* The Sundanese includes the vowel [ɨ] &quot;eu&quot;, which does not exist in Javanese. It is written as ꦼꦴ or ◌ꦼꦵ.
* A word-initial vowel in Sundanese is usually written with one of the independent vowel letters () instead of by adding diacritics to . For example, &quot;a&quot; is written as Sundanese, instead of ꦲ in as in Javanese. It is possible to write word-initial [i] as either &quot;or&quot; , as in Javanese.
* The consonant [ɲ] &quot;ny&quot; is written as (i.e. ) rather than .
* Sundanese does not use the letters or as Sundanese does not distinguish between &quot;ḍa&quot; and &quot;ḍha&quot; or between &quot;ta&quot; and &quot;tha&quot;.

In Sundanese, the letter /i/ is written with a series of letters with added diacritics. In Javanese, no special vowels are used for the sound /e/, while in Sundanese, an independent /e/ is written as a plus a &quot;pepet&quot; diacritic . An independent /ɨ/ is written the same way, with an additional &quot;tarung&quot; or .

===Madurese===
 or is very similar to Javanese &quot;hanacakara&quot;. However, in the Madurese language, there is no difference in the use of aspirated and unaspirated consonants. In Javanese, every consonant carries an inherent /a/ or /ɔ/ vowel; in Madurese, the inherent vowel is /a/ or /ɤ/. Another difference is the use of the &quot;wignyan&quot; diacritic , which in Javanese functions as an &quot;-h&quot; final consonant, but in Madurese represents a glottal stop.

== Unicode ==
Javanese script was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2009 with the release of version 5.2.

The Unicode block for Javanese is U+A980–U+A9DF. There are 91 code points for Javanese script: 53 letters, 19 punctuation marks, 10 numbers, and 9 vowels:

<text>Miss Havisham is a character in Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1861 novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. She is a wealthy spinster, once jilted at the altar, who insists on wearing her wedding dress for the rest of her life. She lives in a ruined mansion with her adopted daughter, Estella. Dickens describes her as looking like &quot;the witch of the place&quot;. In the novel, she schemes to have the young orphan, Pip, fall in love with Estella, so that Estella can &quot;break his heart&quot;.

Although she has often been portrayed in film versions as very elderly, Dickens&#x27;s own notes indicate that she is only in her mid-thirties at the start of the novel. However, it is indicated in the novel that her long seclusion without sunlight has aged her. She is one of the most gothic characters in the work of Dickens.

== Character history ==
Miss Havisham&#x27;s father was a wealthy brewer and her mother died shortly after she was born. Her father remarried and had an illegitimate son, Arthur, with the household cook. Miss Havisham&#x27;s relationship with her half-brother was a strained one. She inherited most of her father&#x27;s fortune and fell in love with a man named Compeyson, who conspired with the jealous Arthur to swindle her of her riches. Her cousin, Matthew Pocket, warned her to be careful, but she was too much in love to listen. On the wedding day, while she was dressing, Miss Havisham received a letter from Compeyson and realised he had defrauded her and she had been left at the altar.

Humiliated and heartbroken, Miss Havisham suffered a mental breakdown and remained alone in her decaying mansion Satis House – never removing her wedding dress, wearing only one shoe, leaving the wedding breakfast and cake uneaten on the table, and allowing only a few people to see her. She also had the clocks in her mansion stopped at twenty minutes to nine: the exact time when she had received Compeyson&#x27;s letter.

Time passed and Miss Havisham had her lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, adopt a daughter for her.
===From protection to revenge===
While Miss Havisham&#x27;s original goal was to prevent Estella from suffering as she had at the hands of a man, it changed as Estella grew older:

 While Estella was still a child, Miss Havisham began casting about for boys who could be a testing ground for Estella&#x27;s education in breaking the hearts of men as vicarious revenge for Miss Havisham&#x27;s pain. Pip, the narrator, is the eventual victim; and Miss Havisham readily dresses Estella in jewels to enhance her beauty and to exemplify all the more the vast social gulf between her and Pip. When, as a young adult, Estella leaves for France to receive education, Miss Havisham eagerly asks him, &quot;Do you feel you have lost her?&quot;

===Repentance and death===

Miss Havisham repents late in the novel when Estella leaves to marry Pip&#x27;s rival, Bentley Drummle; and she realises that she has caused Pip&#x27;s heart to be broken in the same manner as her own; rather than achieving any kind of personal revenge, she has only caused more pain. Miss Havisham begs Pip for forgiveness.

After Pip leaves, Miss Havisham&#x27;s dress catches on fire from her fireplace. Pip rushes back in and saves her. However, she has suffered severe burns to the front of her torso (she is laid on her back), up to the throat. The last words she speaks in the novel are (in a delirium) to Pip, referencing both Estella and a note she, Miss Havisham, has given him with her signature: &quot;Take the pencil and write under my name, &#x27;I forgive her!&#x27;&quot;

A surgeon dresses her burns, and says that they are &quot;far from hopeless&quot;. However, despite rallying for a time, she dies a few weeks later, leaving Estella as her chief beneficiary, and a considerable sum to Herbert Pocket&#x27;s father, as a result of Pip&#x27;s reference.

==Historical inspirations==
In the 1850s, Eliza Emily Donnithorne of Newtown, Sydney (then part of the Colony of New South Wales), was jilted by her groom on her wedding day and spent the rest of her life alone in a darkened house, her wedding breakfast left to rot, and with a chained front door. Donnithorne was widely considered at the time to be Dickens&#x27;s model for Miss Havisham, although this cannot be proven.

Another contemporary inspiration might have been Margaret Catherine Dick of Bonchurch, Isle of Wight, who lived at &quot;Uppermount&quot; house and was the daughter of Captain Samuel Dick. Dickens spent the summer of 1849 staying in Bonchurch writing chapters of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;; during his time in the coastal village he took regular walks up St Boniface Down with Charles George Dick, the brother of Margaret. The character of Mr Dick (who boarded with Miss Betsy Trotwood) in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is based on Charles. In 1860 Margaret Dick was jilted at the altar and began living a reclusive life. In the 1860s, Dickens&#x27;s daughters stayed with the vicar in Bonchurch that was to marry Margaret Dick. Dickens may have based the character of Miss Havisham on Margaret Dick; but named her after her neighbour Miss Haviland.

In the introduction to the 1965 Penguin edition of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, writer Angus Calder notes that &quot;James Payn, a minor novelist, claimed to have given Dickens the idea for Miss Havisham – from a living original of his acquaintance. He declared that Dickens&#x27;s account was &#x27;not one whit exaggerated&#x27;.&quot; Dickens reportedly encountered a wealthy recluse called Elizabeth Parker while staying in Newport, Shropshire, which has an aptly named Havisham Court. However, research by the Newport History Society has found no evidence to support the stories that Dickens ever stayed in Newport, met Miss Parker, or was an inspiration for Miss Havisham. Despite the reports Miss Parker (born 1802) spent the rest of her life as a recluse, census records of the period show she was at Chester (1851), then Whitchurch (1861), before moving to Chetwynd House, Newport in 1863. She was not even living in Newport when Dickens started to write &quot;Great Expectations&quot; in 1859.

Since the publication of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, the character of Miss Havisham has seen numerous comparisons and parallels with many real jilted brides (life imitating art), such as the widely reported case of Alice Pinard-Dôges in Neuilly, France who committed suicide in her bridal gown in 1894.

==Alternative and derived versions==
&quot;Miss Havisham&#x27;s Fire&quot; (1979, revised 2001) is an opera composed by Dominick Argento with a libretto by John Olon-Scrymgeour, based on Dickens&#x27;s character. The entire story is told in flashback during an inquiry into Miss Havisham&#x27;s death. The opera gives her first name as &quot;Aurelia&quot;.

Ronald Frame&#x27;s 2013 novel, &quot;Havisham&quot;, is a non-canonical story about Miss Havisham&#x27;s early life. The story tells how Miss Havisham (given the name of Catherine) is the daughter of a brewer. The story tells of more than just the infamous trauma of being left behind by her fiancé and goes on with her taking charge of her family&#x27;s business before descending into vengeful madness, adopting Estella, and arranging the meeting of Estella and Pip.

Both &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; were inspired by David Lean&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, as were, by extension, the characters of Norma Desmond and Baby Jane Hudson, and their homes.

==In film and television==
In various film and television adaptations of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, the character of Miss Havisham has been played by a number of actors, including:
* Grace Barton (1917)
* Marie Dinesen (1922)
* Florence Reed (1934)
* Martita Hunt (1946)
* Estelle Winwood (1954)
* Marjorie Hawtrey (1959)
* Maxine Audley (1967)
* Margaret Leighton (1974)
* Joan Hickson (1981)
* Jill Forster (1987)
* Jean Simmons (1989)
* Anne Bancroft (1998, renamed to Nora Dinsmoor)
* Charlotte Rampling (1999)
* Gillian Anderson (2011)
* Helena Bonham Carter (2012)
* Tuppence Middleton (2015, renamed to Amelia Havisham)
* Tabu (2016, renamed to Begum Hazrat)
* Olivia Colman (2023, renamed to Amelia Havisham)

==In science==
The condition of the &quot;Miss Havisham effect&quot; has been coined by scientists to describe a person who suffers a painful longing for lost love, which can become a physically addictive pleasure by activation of reward and pleasure centres in the brain, which have been identified to regulate addictive behaviour – regions commonly known to be responsible for craving and drug, alcohol and gambling addiction.

<text>Bakr Sidqi al-Askari (; 1890 – 11 August 1937) was an Iraqi general of Kurdish origin, born in 1890 and assassinated on 11 August 1937, in Mosul.

==Early life==
Bakr Sidqi was born to Kurdish family either in ‘Askar, a Kurdish village, or in Baghdad.

==Military career==
Having studied at the Military College in Istanbul and graduated as a second lieutenant, he fought in the Balkan Wars and joined the Staff College in Istanbul, graduating in 1915. During the First World War, with the outbreak of the Arab Revolt, Sidqi joined Faisal&#x27;s army in Syria and served in Aleppo with a number of other Sharifian officers. From 1919 to 1920, he served as an intelligence agent of the British military forces and was later recommended by the British General Staff in 1921 to an officer rank in the Iraqi army after the collapse of Faisal&#x27;s Arab Kingdom of Syria. His plan was to one day be the Chief of the General Staff but was met with opposition by some Iraqis, who accused him of pushing for a &quot;pro-Kurdish policy.&quot; In response, Sidqi highlighted his half-Arab origins, linking himself with familial ties with Jafar al-Askari. He later attended the British Staff College and was considered one of Iraq&#x27;s most competent officers. He lectured in the military school and achieved the rank of colonel in 1928 and brigadier general in 1933.

In August 1933, Sidqi ordered the Royal Iraqi Army to march to the north to crush so-called &#x27;militant Assyrian separatists&#x27; in Simele, near Mosul, which led to 3,000 Assyrian civilians being killed in the region in the Simele massacre.

The British praised him in 1934 as &quot;the best commander in the Iraqi army and the most efficient one&quot;. In 1935, he cracked down on the Shia Arab tribal rebellions at al-Rumaitha and al-Diwaniya with unprecedented harshness.

According to Malik Mufti, he systematically promoted Kurds and Turkmens for positions in the army until they were 90% of the high-ranking officers, which generated resentment. Bakr Sidqi was &quot;accused of having tried to set up a Kurdish state in the north of Iraq, which would include the Kurds of Iran and Turkey&quot;.

===Simele massacre===

In 1933, the U.S. Foreign Service officer in Iraq, Paul Knabenshue, described public animosity towards the Assyrians at a &quot;fever heat&quot;. With Iraqi independence, the new Assyrian spiritual-temporal leader, &quot;Mar&quot; Shimun XXI Eshai demanded autonomy for Assyrians within the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq, as had been promised by the British and Russians during the First World War, and sought support from Britain. He pressed his case before the League of Nations in 1932. His followers established plans to resign from the Iraq Levies and to regroup as a militia and concentrate in the north, creating a &quot;de facto&quot; Assyrian enclave.

In June 1933, the young Patriarch was invited to Baghdad for negotiations with Hikmat Sulayman&#x27;s government and was detained there after refusing to relinquish temporal authority. Mar Shimun and his family would eventually be exiled to Cyprus, forcing the head of the Assyrian Church of the East to be located in Chicago, where it remained until 2015 when it was brought back to Erbil.

In early August 1933, more than 1,000 unarmed Assyrians who had been refused asylum in Syria crossed the border to return to their villages in Northern Iraq. The French, who controlled Syria, notified the Iraqis that the Assyrians were not armed. However, while the Iraqi soldiers were disarming those whose arms had been returned by the French, shots were fired. It is unclear who fired first. The Royal Iraqi Army was defeated, and 30 Iraqi soldiers were killed. Anti-Assyrian xenophobia, apparent throughout the crisis, increased.

When news of the confrontation reached Baghdad, the government feared disaster in the unity of their armed forces. The government used irregular Kurds, who killed more than 1,280 unarmed Assyrians in two Assyrian villages in the week of 2 August, with most of the massacre occurring on 7 August). Then, on 11 August, Sidqi led a heavily armed force to what was then one of the most heavily inhabited Assyrian district in Iraq, the Simele District.

The Assyrian population of the district of Simele was indiscriminately massacred. In one room alone, 81 Assyrians of the Baz tribe were massacred. Religious leaders were prime targets; eight Assyrian priests were killed during the massacre, including one beheaded and another burned alive. Girls and women were raped and made to march naked before the Iraqi army commanders while the British IRF airplane took pictures that would be used later against the Iraqi government.

Back in Dohuk, 880 unarmed Assyrian civilians were murdered by Sidqi&#x27;s men. In the end, around 71 Assyrian villages were targeted in the Mosul and Dohuk districts. On 13 August, Bakr Sidqi moved his troops to Alqosh, where he planned to inflict an additional massacre on the Assyrians there. The main campaign lasted until 16 August, but violent unprovoked attacks on Assyrians were reported up to the end of the month. After the campaign, Bakr Sidqi was invited to Baghdad for a &quot;victory&quot; rally.

The Simele massacre inspired Raphael Lemkin to create the concept of Genocide. In 1933, Lemkin made a presentation to the Legal Council of the League of Nations conference on international criminal law in Madrid, for which he prepared an essay on the Crime of Barbarity as a crime against international law. The concept of the crime, which later evolved into the idea of genocide, was based mostly on the Simele massacre. The Assyrians were living among their &quot;hereditary enemies&quot; the Kurds in Iraq, and it was &quot;at the hand of the Kurds that they suffered most of the loss of life which Raphael Lemkin was to assess as genocide&quot;.

===1935 Rumaytha and Diwaniyya revolts===
===Coup d&#x27;état===

In 1936, during the reign of Faisal&#x27;s ineffectual son, King Ghazi, General Sidqi—recently named Chief of the General Staff of the Royal Iraqi Army—staged what was probably the first modern military coup d&#x27;état in the Arab world against the government of Yasin al-Hashimi. Eleven Iraqi military planes dropped leaflets over Baghdad on 29 October 1936, requesting the King to take action and dismiss Yasin al-Hashimi&#x27;s administration and for the installment of the ousted anti-reform Prime Minister, Hikmat Sulayman. In addition, the leaflets warned the citizens that military action would be taken against those who do not &quot;answer our sincere appeal&quot;.

The leaflets were signed by Sidqi himself, as the &quot;Commander of the National Forces of Reform&quot;.

General Bakr Sidqi could not have found a better time to execute his plan as the Chief of Staff, General Taha al-Hashimi, was in Ankara, Turkey. As the acting Chief of Staff, Sidqi ordered those in the army and in the air force who shared his beliefs of a military coup to adhere to his directions. Any interference by Sidqi&#x27;s opponents was neutralised by Sidqi himself, who managed to send a telegram to Taha al-Hashimi ordering him not to return. In an interview conducted by Majid Khadduri, he claims that Sidqi had disclosed to Khodduri that the King had called the British Ambassador, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, over to the Zahur Palace for advice. The ambassador suggested for the King to invite all ministers in the Royal Iraqi Government for an emergency meeting. Of those in attendance were Yasin al-Hashimi, Nuri al-Said, General Ja&#x27;far al-Askari and Rashid Ali, Minister of the Interior.

Immediately, the King discounted any notion of a revolutionary movement, but there were reports of some bombing in Serai and the advance of troops towards Baghdad. With the exception of Nuri al-Said, all those present in the palace agreed to comply with the demands of General Bakr Sidqi and allow Hikmat Sulayman to step into power. As a result, Yasin al-Hashimi resigned.

According to Khodduri, Ambassador Kerr suggested for Hikmat to be invited to the meeting. Coincidentally, Sulayman arrived at the palace to deliver the letter, written by Sidqi and Latif Nuri, to the King explaining the implications of the coup.

Jafar al-Askari, who was Minister of Defence during the coup and had served twice as the Prime Minister of Iraq prior to Yasin al-Hashimi, sought out to deter Sidqi from his plans by attempting to distract the two battalions from advancing towards Baghdad. In addition, he tried to appeal to those officers who still regarded him as instrumental in the formation of the Royal Iraqi Army. Concerned at the potetion for any dissension arising from al-Askari&#x27;s actions, Sidqi sent two of his men, Akram Mustapha, member of the air force, and Ismail Tohalla, who had participated in the Simele massacre, to assassinate him.

The death of al-Askari was widely viewed as challenge to the old government and highlighted Sidqi&#x27;s quest in ultimately gaining control of the country by first taking over the army. As a result, Nuri al Sa&#x27;id was exiled to Cairo, and Yasin al-Hashimi was exiled to Istanbul. However, the coup provoked &quot;anti-Kurdish feelings among Arab nationalists&quot;.

Despite the success of the overthrow, Sidqi found it necessary to enter Baghdad with the army and parade with the citizens. According to Khodduri, some felt that it was a move to dissuade any last-minute resistance, and others felt that Sidqi wanted to prove himself with the parade and be applauded for bringing in a new regime for Iraq.

As a result of the coup, Yasin stepped down, insisting that the King write a formal letter accepting his resignation. Sulayman became Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, but, after overthrowing the government, it was Sidqi, who as commander of the armed forces, essentially ruled Iraq. Some other members of the new cabinet included Abu al-Timman, Minister of Finance, Kamil al-Chadirchi, Minister of Economics and Public Works, Abd al-Latif, Minister of Defence, and Yusuf Izz ad-Din Ibrahim as Minister of Education. It is important to note that, although General Sidqi was instrumental in the formation of the coup, he did not want a cabinet position and remained Chief of the General Staff.

However, the murder of al-Askari created resentment, especially among Iraqi forces, of the new government, and Sulayman&#x27;s cabinet lasted only ten months until Sidqi was assassinated. As a result, Sulayman resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Jamil al-Midfai.

Sidqi was recognised as one of the most brilliant officers in the Royal Iraqi Army, known for his intelligence, ambition, and self-confidence. He also believed the army was needed to bring about reform and achieve order, a stance he shared with Atatürk and Reza Shah.

<text>Karen Gay Silkwood (February 19, 1946 – November 13, 1974) was an American laboratory technician and labor union activist known for reporting concerns about corporate practices related to health and safety in a nuclear facility.

She worked at the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Crescent, Oklahoma, making plutonium pellets. She was the first woman ever elected to the union&#x27;s negotiating team at Kerr-McGee. After testifying to the Atomic Energy Commission about her safety concerns, she was found to have plutonium contamination in her body and her home. While driving to meet with a &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist and an official of her union&#x27;s national office, she died in a car crash, the circumstances of which were never explained entirely.

Her family sued Kerr-McGee for the plutonium contamination that Silkwood suffered from. The company settled out of court for US$1.38 million, while not admitting liability. Her story was chronicled in Mike Nichols&#x27;s 1983 Academy Award-nominated movie &quot;Silkwood&quot; in which she was portrayed by Meryl Streep.

== Education and personal life ==
Karen Gay Silkwood was born in 1946 in Longview, Texas, and raised in Nederland, Texas. She lived with her mother Merle, father Bill, and sisters Rosemary and Linda. In high school, Karen was a straight &#x27;A&#x27; student and a member of the National Honor Society. Chemistry was her best subject. In the fall of 1964, she enrolled at Lamar State College of Technology in Beaumont, Texas on a scholarship from the Business and Professional Women&#x27;s Club.

In 1965, Silkwood dropped out of college and eloped with William Meadows, an oil pipeline worker, with whom she had three children. After the couple filed for bankruptcy due to Meadows&#x27; excessive spending habits, and after his refusal to end an extramarital affair, Silkwood left him in 1972 and relocated to Oklahoma City where she worked briefly as a hospital clerk.

== Union activities ==
In August 1972, Silkwood was hired as a metallography laboratory technician with the Kerr-McGee Corporation at their Cimarron River plutonium production plant near Crescent, Oklahoma. She soon joined the Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers Union (OCAW) local. In November 1972, she participated in a strike to protest poor working conditions. Kerr-McGee succeeded in breaking the strike by hiring people from the surrounding area to cross the picket line. The company&#x27;s managers also began &quot;working behind the scenes to entice workers to sign a petition calling for a decertification election to eliminate the union.&quot;

In August 1974, Silkwood was elected to the OCAW local&#x27;s three-person bargaining committee, the first woman to hold such a position at Kerr-McGee. It was a critical time for the local as the decertification drive had collected enough signatures to force an election on October 16.

Silkwood&#x27;s specific union duties included investigating health and safety issues. She discovered at the Cimarron plant what she considered to be numerous violations of health regulations, such as exposure of workers to contamination, faulty respiratory equipment, and improper storage of samples. She believed the lack of sufficient shower facilities was increasing the risk of employee contamination. She also found evidence of missing or misplaced plutonium.

On September 26, 1974, Silkwood and the two other committee members attended a meeting in Washington, D.C. with Tony Mazzocchi, OCAW&#x27;s legislative director. The committee members voiced their complaints about the dangerous workplace conditions and sought advice on how to win the upcoming decertification election. In their discussions, Mazzocchi learned that the committee members (and presumably the rest of the Cimarron plant) were not adequately informed about the hazardous material they were working with. He later wrote, &quot;When I explained the connection between plutonium exposure and cancer, it took Karen by surprise.&quot; And so they made plans that day to have two atomic scientists from the University of Minnesota come speak to the Cimarron workers. Mazzocchi recalled how Silkwood took him aside at one point and said, &quot;You know, there&#x27;s some other problems that I&#x27;d like to talk to you about.&quot;: At the conclusion of the meeting, Mazzocchi and his staffer Steve Wodka counseled that the best hope for survival of the Cimarron workers and their local was to raise awareness about Kerr-McGee&#x27;s practices with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the national press.

To that end, the OCAW initiated an aggressive whistleblowing campaign. They claimed that &quot;the Kerr-McGee plant had manufactured faulty fuel rods, falsified product inspection records, and risked employee safety&quot;. The union threatened litigation. On September 27, Silkwood testified to the AEC about having been contaminated with plutonium, and she alleged that safety standards had been relaxed because of a need to increase production. She appeared at the AEC hearings along with the two other committee members who likewise testified that Kerr-McGee was endangering its workers. The whistleblowing effort and the visibility it brought—combined with the educational sessions on plutonium toxicity that Silkwood arranged with the atomic scientists (attended by one hundred of her co-workers)—helped fight off decertification. The Cimarron local voted 80–61 in October to keep the OCAW as their bargaining agent.

On November 5, 1974, Silkwood performed a routine self-check that showed almost 400 times the legal limit for plutonium contamination. She was decontaminated at the plant and sent home with a testing kit to collect urine and feces for further analysis. Although there was plutonium on the inner portions of the gloves which she had been using, the gloves did not have any leaks or perforations according to tests performed subsequently by Kerr-McGee personnel. This suggests the contamination had come not from inside the glovebox, but from some other source.

The next morning, as she left for a union meeting, Silkwood again tested positive for plutonium, although she had performed only paperwork tasks that morning. She was given a more intensive decontamination. On November 7, as she entered the plant, she was found to be severely contaminated, even expelling contaminated air from her lungs. A health physics team accompanied her back to her home and found plutonium traces on several surfaces, especially in the bathroom and the refrigerator. When the house was later stripped and decontaminated, some of her property had to be destroyed. Silkwood, her boyfriend Drew Stephens, and her roommate Sherri Ellis were sent to Los Alamos National Laboratory for in-depth testing to determine the extent of the contamination in their bodies.

There were questions about how Silkwood became contaminated during this three-day period from November 5-7. She said the contamination in the bathroom may have occurred when she spilled her urine sample on the morning of November 7. This was consistent with the fact that the samples she collected at home had extremely high levels of plutonium, while the samples collected in &quot;fresh&quot; jars at the plant and at Los Alamos showed much lower levels.

She concluded that someone working for Kerr-McGee had deliberately contaminated her. Kerr-McGee&#x27;s management alleged that Silkwood had contaminated herself in order to harm the company&#x27;s reputation. According to Richard Rashke&#x27;s book &quot;The Killing of Karen Silkwood&quot;, the particular type of plutonium found in Silkwood&#x27;s home came from a Cimarron production area, pellet lot 29, where she did not work. Starting in August, the pellet lot 29 samples were kept in a Kerr-McGee vault to which she did not have access.

== Death ==
By November, Silkwood believed she had assembled sufficient documentation, including company papers, to corroborate her claims against Kerr-McGee. She decided to go public with this evidence and contacted David Burnham, a &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist whom Tony Mazzocchi referred her to. Burnham had previously broken the Frank Serpico police corruption case and was now researching atomic energy issues.

On November 13, 1974, Silkwood attended a 5:30 p.m. union meeting, along with ten other members of the OCAW local, at the Hub Cafe in Crescent. She made a brief presentation and sipped iced tea. Another attendee at the meeting, Wanda Jean Jung, stated in a sworn affidavit in January 1975 that Silkwood had a folder, a spiral notebook, and a packet of documents with her at the cafe. During a break in the meeting, Jung said she spoke with Silkwood who was crying quietly and admitted how frightened she was &quot;that she had been so badly contaminated, she would eventually get cancer and die from the plutonium in her lungs.&quot; But then, Jung stated in her affidavit, Karen pointed to her documents and said, &quot;there was one thing she was glad about ... that she had all the proof concerning falsification of records. As she said this, she clenched her hand more firmly on the folder and notebook she was holding. She told me she was on her way to meet Steve Wodka and a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter ... to give them this material.&quot;

At 7:10 p.m., Silkwood left the meeting, got into her 1973 white Honda Civic and drove alone toward Oklahoma City, about away, to meet with Burnham and Wodka. Less than 30 minutes later, Silkwood&#x27;s body was discovered in her smashed-up car, 7.3 miles from the cafe. The car had run off the left side of State Highway 74, traveled some distance along the grass shoulder, and then struck the wing wall of a concrete culvert 0.11 miles (180 m) south of the intersection with West Industrial Road (). The impact from hitting the wall caused her to be impaled by her steering wheel and pinned to the roof of the Honda Civic. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Silkwood&#x27;s car contained none of the documents she had been holding in the meeting at the Hub Cafe. The Oklahoma state trooper at the crash site remembers that he found one or two tablets of the sedative methaqualone (Quaalude) in the car, and what he believed were two marijuana joints. The coroner found 0.35 milligrams of methaqualone in her blood—&quot;a therapeutic dose is .25 mg, a toxic dose, .50 mg.&quot; The Oklahoma Highway Patrol report concluded that she fell asleep at the wheel and died as a result of an accident.

The OCAW hired a crash investigator, A. O. Pipkin Jr., to examine the car and the scene of the crash. Based on his examination, Silkwood had not fallen asleep while driving: &quot;The steering wheel was bent back on the sides, proving she&#x27;d been wide awake and hanging on tight as she tried to maintain control.&quot; In support of his notion that she was awake, he added two other observations. The first was the anomalous fact that her car had veered from the right lane to the left shoulder: But most significantly, Pipkin found damage to the rear of the vehicle which, according to her friends, had not been present before. As the crash was entirely a head-on, front-end collision, it didn&#x27;t explain the fresh dents on the left rear fender and the bumper above it. A microscopic analysis of the rear of the car revealed paint chips that could have come only from impact by another vehicle.

In light of Pipkin&#x27;s findings, some friends and journalists theorized that Silkwood&#x27;s car was rammed from behind with intent to cause a fatal crash. OCAW officials Mazzocchi and Wodka did not believe it was premeditated murder because that stretch of highway is flat, and the odds of her hitting an obstruction like a concrete culvert were so remote. Instead, they suspected it was an attempt, which went tragically awry, to scare and intimidate her into stopping her whistleblowing and returning the documents. Another hypothesis is that she was being chased to force her to halt. She drove evasively, including speeding along the left grass shoulder, and while looking behind her or to her right at the chase car, she didn&#x27;t realize until too late that she was racing toward the culvert.

Due to concerns about contamination, the Atomic Energy Commission and the State Medical Examiner requested analysis of Silkwood&#x27;s organs by the Los Alamos Tissue Analysis Program. On November 18, she was buried in Kilgore, Texas.

Silkwood&#x27;s plutonium contamination and the mysterious circumstances of her death became a national news story. It aroused public suspicion and resulted in a federal investigation of Cimarron plant security. National Public Radio reported that the investigation determined of plutonium had been misplaced at the plant. The unaccounted-for nuclear material generated speculation as to its whereabouts. Richard Rashke suggested that the missing plutonium may have been stolen by &quot;a plutonium smuggling ring&quot; given that the quantity was enough to make three or four nuclear bombs. He added that security at the Cimarron plant was so lax, workers could easily smuggle out finished plutonium pellets.

Kerr-McGee closed its nuclear fuel plants in 1975. The Department of Energy (DOE) reported the Cimarron plant as fully decontaminated and decommissioned by 1994.

== &quot;Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee&quot; ==
Silkwood&#x27;s father and her children filed a lawsuit against Kerr-McGee for gross negligence on behalf of her estate. The time leading up to the trial was likewise filled with controversy. According to Rashke, officials investigating Kerr-McGee&#x27;s operations and the circumstances of the car crash were themselves at risk: &quot;People had been tailed and forced off lonely roads by speeding cars. Two shadowy characters about to be subpoenaed suddenly packed up their attaché cases and fled to West Germany. One apparently healthy police officer about to be deposed died of a heart attack. There was no autopsy. Someone tried to murder a Kerr-McGee manager who knew too much. Someone tried to assassinate Bill Taylor, the chief investigator for the legal team representing the Silkwood family. And then there were all those strange clicks on everyone&#x27;s telephone.&quot;

The trial occurred in spring of 1979. Gerry Spence was the chief attorney for the Silkwood estate; the other major attorneys were Daniel Sheehan, Arthur Angel, and James Ikard. William Paul was chief attorney for Kerr-McGee. The estate presented evidence that the autopsy showed Silkwood was contaminated with plutonium at the time of her death. To prove the contamination was sustained at the plant, evidence was given by a series of witnesses who were former employees of the facility.

The defense relied on expert witness Dr. George Voelz, a high-ranking scientist at Los Alamos. Voelz said he believed the contamination in Silkwood&#x27;s body was within legal standards. The defense later proposed that Silkwood was a troublemaker who might have poisoned herself. After the summation arguments, Judge Frank Theis told the jury, &quot;[I]f you find that the damage to the person or property of Karen Silkwood resulted from the operation of this plant ... defendant Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corporation is liable...&quot;

The jury rendered its verdict of US$505,000 in damages and US$10,000,000 in punitive damages. On appeal in federal court, the judgment was reduced to US$5,000 (the estimated value of Silkwood&#x27;s losses in property at her rental house), and the award for punitive damages was reversed. In &quot;Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.&quot; 464 US 238 (1984), the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the original jury verdict. The court ruled that &quot;the NRC&#x27;s exclusive authority to set safety standards did not foreclose the use of state tort remedies.&quot; Although indicating it would appeal for other reasons, Kerr-McGee agreed in 1986 to settle out of court for US$1.38 million ($ today), while admitting no liability.

== Portrayals in media ==
* Silkwood is mentioned in the song, &quot;We Almost Lost Detroit&quot;, on the 1977 music album, &quot;Bridges&quot;, by Gil Scott-Heron &amp; Brian Jackson.
* With clear echoes of the Silkwood story, the 1979 movie &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; depicts a fictional Southern California nuclear power plant that has to be shut down following a near disaster caused by a defective water pump. The incident is filmed by an L.A. TV news crew. Soon thereafter, the power plant&#x27;s management wants to reopen and provides radiographs to prove the water pump has been repaired. But a whistleblower in the power plant finds evidence that the welds for the water pumps were deceptively X-rayed to conceal their faulty condition. He hands the false radiographs to Hector Salas, a member of the news crew, to deliver to a convention of nuclear scientists which is occurring in L.A. While driving to the convention, Salas is rammed from behind and forced off the road. Unlike Silkwood, he does not die in the crash, but the radiographs are stolen from his car.
* Silkwood was portrayed on stage by actress Jehane Dyllan in the one-person play &quot;Silkwood&quot;, which Dyllan scripted along with Susan Holleran and Bobbi Ausubel. Ausubel also directed the piece. It ran April 7-12, 1981 at Theater Works, UMass-Park Square in Boston.
* The 1983 movie &quot;Silkwood&quot; is an account of Silkwood&#x27;s life and the events resulting from her activism, based on an original screenplay by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen. Meryl Streep played the title role and was nominated for an Academy Award and a BAFTA. Cher played Karen&#x27;s friend and roommate Sherri Ellis, and was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. Mike Nichols was nominated for Best Director. Ephron and Arlen were nominated for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.
* PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; produced the program, &quot;Nuclear Reaction,&quot; which contained aspects of the Silkwood story. The program&#x27;s website includes supplementary text about her that was first printed on November 23, 1995 in &quot;Los Alamos Science&quot;. The program covered the risks of nuclear energy and raised questions about corporate accountability and responsibility.
* The 2004 novel &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (and its 2012 film adaptation) has a section in which a female journalist is nearly murdered via car accident to prevent her from publishing a report on a conspiracy to cause a nuclear power plant catastrophe.
*Silkwood&#x27;s death is mentioned in the Netflix TV documentary mini series &quot;Meltdown: Three Mile Island&quot; (2022). In Episode 3 entitled &quot;The Whistleblower&quot;, insiders claim that &quot;cost-cutting measures and intimidation tactics create a danger far worse than the accident itself.&quot;

<text>Cleveland International Records is an independent record label formed in 1976 by Steve Popovich, Sr. originally founded in Willoughby, Ohio and moved to Nashville.

==History==
One of the first albums the label released was &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; (1977) by Meat Loaf which has sold over 40 million copies worldwide. They have also released recordings by Ronnie Spector, B. J. Thomas, Ian Hunter, Slim Whitman and The Irish Rovers, among others.

After working in the Nashville industry for more than a decade, collaborating with the likes of Johnny Cash, Popovich Sr. moved back to Cleveland in 1994. A year later, he re-established the Cleveland International label with a focus on Polka music.

The label won a lawsuit in 2005 when Sony Music produced copies of the &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; CD without the Cleveland International logo. In 2007, a court ordered Sony to pay Cleveland $5 million.

With his estate finally settled, Popovich, Sr.&#x27;s son, Steve Popovich, Jr. revived the record label in late December 2018. Cleveland International Records will operate out of Nashville, but Popovich, Jr. said the goal will be to open an office in Cleveland down the road.

==Dispute between Cleveland International and Sony==
In 1995, Cleveland International sued Sony Music Entertainment for unpaid royalties from sales of &quot;Bat Out of Hell.&quot; Under the terms of the 1998 settlement agreement ending the suit, Sony agreed to pay US$6.7 million and include the Cleveland International logo on all future releases of the album. In 2002, Steve Popovich, founder of Cleveland International, sued Sony alleging that Sony had failed to include the logo on the album as agreed. In 2005, the federal district court in Cleveland, Ohio entered judgment against Sony pursuant to a jury verdict in favor of Popovich and awarded Popovich US$5,700,000 in damages for Sony&#x27;s breach of the 1998 settlement agreement. Sony appealed the verdict but in 2007 the federal appellate court in Cincinnati, Ohio affirmed the judgment of the trial court. In 2012, Sony reached a final out-of-court settlement with Popovich&#x27;s estate over more unpaid royalties revealed in an audit performed prior to Popovich&#x27;s death in 2011.

<doc id="573283" wikidata="Q862825" url="?curid=573283" title="White-breasted waterhen">
<text>The white-breasted waterhen (Amaurornis phoenicurus) is a waterbird of the rail and crake family, Rallidae, that is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia. They are dark slaty birds with a clean white face, breast and belly. They are somewhat bolder than most other rails and are often seen stepping slowly with their tail cocked upright in open marshes or even drains near busy roads. They are largely crepuscular in activity and during the breeding season, just after the first rains, make loud and repetitive croaking calls.

==Description==

Adult white-breasted waterhens have mainly dark grey upperparts and flanks, and a white face, neck and breast. The lower belly and undertail are cinnamon or white coloured. The body is flattened laterally to allow easier passage through the reeds or undergrowth. They have long toes, a short tail and a yellow bill and legs. Sexes are similar but females measure slightly smaller. Immature birds are much duller versions of the adults. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails.

Several subspecies are named for the populations that are widely distributed. The nominate subspecies is described from Sri Lanka but is often widened to include &quot;chinensis&quot; of mainland India and adjoining regions in Asia, west to Arabia and east nearly to Japan. The remaining subspecies are those from islands and include &quot;insularis&quot; of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, &quot;midnicobaricus&quot; of the central Nicobars, &quot;leucocephala&quot; of Car Nicobar, &quot;maldivus&quot; of the Maldives, &quot;javanicus&quot; of Java and &quot;leucomelanus&quot; of Sulawesi and the Lesser Sundas.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is marshes across tropical Asia from Pakistan east to Indonesia. They are mainly seen in the plains but have been known from the higher hills such as in Nainital (1300m) and the High Range (1500m) in Kerala. These large long rails are permanent residents throughout their range. They make short distance movements and are known to colonize new areas. They have been noted as some of the early colonizers on the volcanic island of Rakata. Although most often found near freshwater, they are also found near brackish water and even the seashore when there is no freshwater as on the volcanic Barren Island in the Andamans.

==Behaviour and ecology==

These birds are usually seen singly or in pairs as they forage slowly along the edge of a waterbody mainly on the ground but sometimes clambering up low vegetation. The tail is held up and jerked as they walk. They probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects (large numbers of beetles have been recorded), small fish (which are often carefully washed in water), aquatic invertebrates and grains or seeds such as those of &quot;Pithecolobium dulce&quot;. They may sometimes feed in deeper water in the manner of a moorhen.

The nesting season is mainly June to October but varies locally. They nest in a dry location on the ground in marsh vegetation, laying 6-7 eggs. Courtship involves bowing, billing and nibbling. The eggs hatch in about 19 days. Both sexes incubate the eggs and take care of the chicks. Chicks often dive underwater to escape predation. Adults are said to build a roost or brood nest where young chicks and the adults roost.

Many rails are very secretive, but white-breasted waterhens are often seen out in the open. They can be noisy especially at dawn and dusk, with loud croaky calls. The Andamans population &quot;insularis&quot; is said to make duck like &quot;quack&quot; calls.

==In culture==
Local names of this bird are often formed by onomatopoeia (based on the sound it makes), for example &quot;ruak-ruak&quot; in Malay and (කොරවක්කා) in Sinhala.; although differently formed local names are also not uncommon, such as &quot;Dahuk&quot; in Bengali (used in Bangladesh and the Bengali-speaking areas of India), &quot;Dauk&quot; (ডাউক) in Assamese, &quot;Gur-gu-aa&quot; in Boro, &quot;Vo-kurwak&quot; in Karbi, and &quot;Keruwak&quot; in Iban and Sarawakian Malay. In Odisha it is called as &quot;Daahuka&quot; in Odia. In Maharashtra it is called as &quot;pankombadi&quot; or &quot;kuak kombadi&quot; in Marathi. In Malayalam they are called &quot;kulakozhi&quot;. They are called “Kanbili” in the Maldives. In Kannada they are called &#x27;hundukoli&#x27; (ಹುಂಡುಕೋಳಿ). In Tamil, they are called &quot;kaanaangkozi&quot;.

In Cebuano, it is known as &quot;tikúgas&quot;, it has cognates in several related languages in Taiwan which refer to the Taiwan bamboo partridge (e.g. &quot;tikolac&quot; in Amis).

The naturalist writer &quot;Eha&quot; humorously describes the call of this species:
&quot;It began with loud harsh roars which might have been elicited from a bear by roasting it slowly over a large fire, then suddenly changed to a clear note repeated like the coo of a dove.&quot;

<text>Kaviyo Bach Benti Chaupai (also referred to as Chaupai Sahib or simply as Benti Chaupai) (Gurmukhi: ਕਬਿਯੋਬਾਚ ਬੇਨਤੀ ਚੌਪਈ or ਚੌਪਈ ਸਾਹਿਬ) is a hymn by Guru Gobind Singh. Chaupai is the 405th &quot;Charitar&quot; of the Charitropakhyan composition contained within the Dasam Granth. It forms part of a Sikh&#x27;s Nitnem (daily scripture reading) and is read during Amrit Sanchar ceremonies. 

== Synopsis ==
Chaupai Sahib is an extension of the 405th charitar, where two massive battles, including the latter between &quot;Mahakal&quot; and various demons, is narrated, as well as the struggle of the goddess that was born as a result of the first battle, and her quest for the acceptance of the Supreme Being, by her abandoning all other worldly desires, is illustrated.

== Structure ==
Benti Chaupai consists of three parts: Kabiyo Bach Benti Chaupai, Arril, Chaupai, Savaiye, and Dohra. Kabiyo Bach Benti Chaupai is normally referred to as Chaupai in short. The Savaiya and the Dohra typically recited in Sikh Liturgy during the recitation of the &quot;Chaupai&quot; is not found in the Charitropakhyan, but comes at the end of the Ram Avtar subchapter in the Chaubis Avtar.

==Dating==

Chaupai Sahib, as the author suggests, was completed on Sunday, on eighth day (Ashtami) of waxing moon phase (Shukla Paksha) of Lunar month of Bhadrapada in Vikram Samvat year 1753 (1696 A.D.).

The author says:

==Method and purpose==

This hymn offers one protection and security and many Sikhs recite this Bani to gain spiritual safety and defense from external and internal enemies, worries and afflictions. The Gurmukhi gives one self-confidence and an upbeat feeling. This Bani gives one the feeling of reliability and dependability on the Lord.

According to the researchers: Gurinder Singh Mann, Leicester UK and Dr Kamalroop Singh, London, the Chaupai Sahib was completed at Gurdwara Bhabour Sahib, Nangal as the closure of Sri Charitropakhyan written by the Tenth Guru.

<text>Kalyan (Pronunciation: ) is a city on the banks of Ulhas River in Thane district of Maharashtra state in Konkan division. It is governed by Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation. Kalyan is a subdivision (Taluka) of Thane district. Kalyan and its neighbouring township of Dombivli jointly form Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation, abbreviated as KDMC. It is a founding city of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Kalyan is the 7th biggest city in Maharashtra and 29th in India. Kalyan also serves as a major railway station for the trains bound to Mumbai and is a large junction separating two routes, one going Karjat and other Kasara.

In Colonial India, the British Raj called the city &quot;Kallian&quot;, &quot;Cullian&quot;, or &quot;Calliannee&quot;. The cast iron mileposts that existed in and around Kalyan had the spelling Callian as the name for the town and were installed during the colonial times.


==Around Kalyan==

===Durgadi Fort===

The city of Kalyan was surrounded by a fort wall, the construction of which began during Shah Jahan&#x27;s reign and was completed during Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign in 1694 A.D. This city wall, which ran 2123 yards and was guarded by 4 gates and 11 towers. The fort wall enclosed an area of 70 acres and on a high mound near the Kalyan creek, where the current Ganesh ghat stands, was a fort as early as 1570.

The wall of the fort along the top of the inner bank of the ditch, and, near the north end, had a gateway known as the Delhi or Killyacha Darwaja. 

Under the Marathas (1760–72), a new gate about to the south of the Ganesh gate was opened near the mansion of Ramji Mahadeo Biwalkar, the Peshwa&#x27;s Governor. In the citadel of the fort Marathas built a small wooden temple of Durgadevi behind the mosque, and called the fort Durgadi Killain after the Hindu goddess Durga. The fort measures in length and somewhat less in breadth. Under the English rule, the fort wall was dismantled and stones carried away to build the Kalyan and Thane piers and a dwelling for the customs inspector in the west of the Kalyan fort. The gate to the north-west is almost the only trace of the fort wall, which is of rough stone masonry. During 1876 the original idol of Durga was stolen.

<doc id="573295" wikidata="Q271374" url="?curid=573295" title="Guarujá">
<text>Guarujá (; ) is a municipality in the São Paulo state of Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of the Baixada Santista. The population is 311,116 (2022 preliminary census count) in an area of . This place name comes from the Tupi language, and means &quot;narrow path&quot;. The population is highly urbanized, forms a 2nd urban core and beachfront island across the river from São Vicente Island, the island (Ilha de Santo Amaro) is coterminous with the municipality, with exception of small offshore isles like Ilha dos Arvoredos.

==Toponym==
See also: Tupi-Guarani place names in Brazil

As Eduardo Navarro explains in his Dicionário de Tupi Antigo (2013), &quot;Guarujá&quot; is derived from the Tupi term agûarausá, which designates a type of crab, the guaruçá.

Although it is common to use the definite article before the name of the city, this usage is not correct. Therefore, one should say &quot;Tenho casa em Guarujá&quot; and not &quot;Tenho casa no Guarujá&quot;.

==Geography==
Guarujá is located on the Santo Amaro Island, situated on the shore of São Paulo. Its main economic sources are seasonal tourism and port related activities.

Guarujá is a popular weekend destination for families from São Paulo, who can get there driving in less than one hour (through the Imigrantes highway). Traffic gets heavy during the evening on the holidays.

Guarujá has a borough called &quot;Vicente de Carvalho&quot;, in tribute to the Parnasianist poet.

A nickname for the city is &quot;The Pearl of the Atlantic&quot;.

In total, Guarujá has 27 beaches, with the most famous including Guaiúba, Tombo, Astúrias, Pitangueiras, Enseada, Pernambuco, Perequê, São Pedro, Tijucopava, Iporanga, Praia Branca and Praia Preta.

==Economy==
Guarujá, its history, infrastructure and proximity to the country&#x27;s most populous city, provides strong attractive real estate and tourism. Much of the region on the coast, the beaches near the center (mainly Asturias Pitangueiras, Enseada, and Tombo) are taken by buildings devoted to the seasonal population, who arrives mostly in summer. Tourism, therefore, is the most important component that moves the economy.

The other part, relevant and non-seasonal, comes from the port (left bank of the Port of Santos) and related activities, such as transportation. Due to its proximity to Cubatão (largest industrial district in the country) and ports, there is also interest in industrial occupation in the region, started in 1976 by Dow Chemical, still the only major industry to occupy the region.

According to the IBGE of 2006 the production of wealth in the service area in the city, added that year, US$1.820 billion, equivalent to 0.14% in participation in the Brazilian GDP.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Guarujá is twinned with:
* Cascais, Lisbon District, Portugal (2000)
* Brotas, São Paulo, Brazil (2001)
* Lobito, Benguela Province, Angola (2013)

==Tourist attractions==
* Andradas Fort
* Acqua Mundo
* Teatro Municipal Procópio Ferreira

==Media==
In telecommunications, the city was served by the Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by the Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

==Sports==
The Estádio Municipal Antônio Fernandes is a football (soccer) stadium located in the city. Associação Desportiva Guarujá play their home games at this stadium. The Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team picked Guarujá as their base during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

<text>The watercock (Gallicrex cinerea) is a waterbird in the rail and crake family, Rallidae that is widely distributed across Southeast Asia. It is the only member of the genus Gallicrex.

==Taxonomy==
The watercock was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the coots in the genus &quot;Fulica&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fulica cinerea&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;crested gallinule&quot; from China that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The watercock is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Gallicrex&quot; that was introduced in 1852 by Edward Blyth. The genus name combines the genus &quot;Gallus&quot; with the genus &quot;Crex&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;cinerea&quot; is from the Latin &quot;cinereus&quot; meaning &quot;ash-grey&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

Traditionally held to be closely related to moorhens (which the adult male visually closely resembles), it is actually a member of a mostly tropical Asian clade containing also &quot;Aenigmatolimnas, Amaurornis, Himantornis&quot; and &quot;Megacrex&quot;.

==Description==
Adult male watercocks are long and weigh . They have mainly black-grey plumage with red legs, bill, extended frontal shield and horn. Young males are buff in colour, darkening as they mature. Their bill is yellow and their legs are green. Female birds are smaller at and . They are dark brown above and paler below. Their plumage is streaked and barred with darker markings. The bill is yellow and the legs are green. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails. The body of this rail is flattened laterally to allow easier passage through the reeds or undergrowth. It has long toes and a short tail.

Watercock are quite secretive, but are sometimes seen out in the open. They are noisy birds, especially at dawn and dusk, with a loud, gulping call.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is swamps across south Asia from India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to south China, Korea, Japan, Philippines and Indonesia. These large rails are mainly permanent residents throughout their range.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
They nest in a dry location on the ground in marsh vegetation, laying 3-6 eggs. 

===Food and feeding===
These birds probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and small fish and seeds. They forage on the ground.

<text>Cassandre, pseudonym of Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron (24 January 1901 – 17 June 1968), was a French painter, commercial poster artist, and typeface designer.

==Early life and career==
He was born Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron in Kharkiv, Slobidska Ukraine- autonomous unit within the Russian Empire, to French parents. As a young man, he moved to Paris, where he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and at the Académie Julian. The popularity of posters as advertising afforded him an opportunity to work for a Parisian printing house. Inspired by cubism as well as surrealism, he earned a reputation with works such as &quot;Bûcheron&quot; (Woodcutter), a poster created for a cabinetmaker that won first prize at the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes.

Cassandre became successful enough that with the help of partners he was able to set up his own advertising agency called Alliance Graphique, serving a wide variety of clients during the 1930s. He is perhaps best known for his posters advertising travel, for clients such as the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits. He was a pioneer of airbrush arts.

His creations for the Dubonnet wine company were among the first posters designed in a manner that allowed them to be seen by occupants in moving vehicles. His posters are memorable for their innovative graphic solutions and their frequent denotations to such painters as Max Ernst and Pablo Picasso. In addition, he taught graphic design at the École des Arts Décoratifs and then at the École d&#x27;Art Graphique.

With typography an important part of poster design, the company created several new typeface styles. Cassandre developed Bifur in 1929, the sans serif Acier Noir in 1935, and in 1937 an all-purpose font called Peignot. In 1936, his works were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City which led to commissions from Harper&#x27;s Bazaar to do cover designs.
==Later career==
With the onset of World War II, Cassandre served in the French army until the fall of France. His business long gone, he survived by creating stage sets and costumes for the theatre, something he had dabbled in during the 1930s. After the war, he continued this line of work while also returning to easel painting. He worked with several famous French fashion houses, designing playing cards and scarfs for Hermès and the well-known Yves Saint Laurent logo.

In his later years, Cassandre suffered from bouts of depression prior to his suicide in Paris in June 1968. He was buried in the Parisian Montparnasse Cemetery (8th division).

In 1985, his son Henri Mouron published a study of his father&#x27;s work in a book titled &quot;A.M. Cassandre&quot;.

==Typeface==
These foundry types were produced by Deberny &amp; Peignot from designs by Cassandre:

==Notable works==
* &quot;Nord Express&quot;, 1925
* &quot;Etoile Du Nord&quot;, 1927
* &quot;La Route Bleue&quot;, 1929
* &quot;Chemin De Fer Du Nord&quot;, 1929
* &quot;L’ Atlantique&quot;, 1931

<text>The Wedding Banquet is a 1993 romantic comedy film directed, produced and co-written by Ang Lee. The story concerns a bisexual Taiwanese immigrant man (Winston Chao, in his film debut) who marries a mainland Chinese woman (May Chin) to placate his parents (Gua Ah-leh and Lung Sihung) and get her a green card. His plan backfires when his parents arrive in the United States to plan his wedding banquet and he has to hide the truth of his gay partner (Mitchell Lichtenstein). It was a co-production of Lee&#x27;s Good Machine production company, and the Taiwanese Central Motion Picture Corporation.

Lee&#x27;s second feature film and his first to get a theatrical release in the United States, &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; premiered at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Golden Bear. It was both a critical and commercial success and won five Golden Horse Awards, including Best Film and Best Director. It received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Foreign-Language Film, as well as six Independent Spirit Award nominations.

Together with &quot;Pushing Hands&quot; (1991) and &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; (1994), all showing the Confucian family at risk, and all starring the Taiwanese actor Lung Sihung, &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; forms what has been called Lee&#x27;s &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; trilogy.

In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Gao Wai-Tung is a bisexual Taiwanese immigrant happily living in Manhattan with his gay Jewish partner Simon. He has not come out to his traditionally-minded parents who live back in Taiwan and, as he&#x27;s in his late-20s, they&#x27;ve become eager to see him get married and have a child in order to continue the family line. When his parents hire a dating service, Wai-Tung and Simon stall for time by inventing numerous impossible demands. They demand an opera singer while requesting that she must be 5&#x27;9&quot;, have two PhDs, and speak five languages. To their shock, the service actually locates a 5&#x27;8&quot; Chinese woman who meets all but one of their qualifications; but having only a single PhD instead of two. She is very gracious when Wai-Tung explains his dilemma, as she too is hiding a relationship with a white man from her parents.

At Simon&#x27;s insistence, Wai-Tung decides to marry one of his tenants, Wei-Wei, a penniless artist from mainland China in need of a green card. Besides helping Wei-Wei, the couple hope that this will placate Wai-Tung&#x27;s parents. To complicate matters, Mr. and Mrs. Gao announce they will visit. Before the parents arrive, Simon tells Wei-Wei everything she needs to know about Wai-Tung&#x27;s habits, body, and lifestyle; and the three hastily take down all gay imagery and décor from the house and hang Mandarin calligraphy scrolls in its place.

Mr. and Mrs. Gao arrive bringing gifts and US$30,000 to hold an extravagant wedding for their son, believing he has a wealthy fiancée. Wai-Tung dares not tell his parents the truth, because his father (a retired army officer) has just recovered from a stroke. As a part of the lie, Wai-Tung introduces Simon as his landlord.

The day after his parents arrive, Wai-Tung announces that he and Wei-Wei plan to be married by a Justice of the Peace. However, the heartbreak his mother experiences at the courthouse wedding, both at the arrangement and at the discovery of the low social class of Wei-Wei, moves Wai-Tung to make up for the &#x27;disgraceful&#x27; wedding by accepting the offer of a magnificent wedding banquet from Mr. Gao&#x27;s former batman, who now owns a restaurant and reception hall. After the lavish banquet, a huge party of relatives and friends barges into the bridal suite for an after party and demand that the newlyweds get in bed naked before they will leave. This leads to Wei-Wei&#x27;s pregnancy. Simon is extremely upset when he finds out, provoking an argument between the two of them and Wei-Wei, and his relationship with Wai-Tung begins to deteriorate.

Mr. Gao suffers another stroke, and in a moment of anger after the fight, Wai-Tung admits the truth to his mother. She is shocked and insists that he not tell his father. However, the perceptive Mr. Gao has seen more than he is letting on, and tells Simon that he knows about their relationship and considers Simon his son as well, appreciating the considerable sacrifices he made to be together with Wai-Tung. Mr. Gao gives Simon a &quot;hongbao&quot;, a symbolic admission of their relationship, but has Simon promise not to let on to the others that he knows the truth; saying that without the sham marriage, he&#x27;d never have a grandchild. While en route to an appointment for an abortion, Wei-Wei decides to keep the baby; and asks Simon to stay together with Wai-Tung and be the baby&#x27;s father too.

At the airport before the Gaos&#x27; flight home, Mr. Gao accepts Simon and warmly shakes his hand and Mrs. Gao bids Wei-Wei a fond farewell before they walk off to board their plane; leaving the unconventional new family to figure themselves out.

== Analysis ==
Elisabetta Marino, author of &quot;When East Meets West: A Sweet and Sour Encounter in Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot;&quot;, wrote that the film suggests that there can be a reconciliation between Eastern and Western cultures, unlike in Amy Tan&#x27;s novels where the cultural differences are portrayed as irreconcilable.
About 60% of the film&#x27;s dialogue is in Mandarin Chinese. Marino wrote that &quot;after striving to read the subtitles for the first ten or fifteen minutes, one finds oneself so completely absorbed in the flow of the story, in the tones of the several voices, in the gestures and the facial expressions of the actors, that one simply forgets to read and reaches an understanding beyond languages, beyond words, following a plot and, most of all, a set of characters who do not conform to the stereotypical portrayals an American audience would expect.&quot; Marino argued that &quot;Lee&#x27;s creative process and his final choice of two languages, Mandarin Chinese and English, for the movie are in themselves symptomatic of his wish to reach a peaceful coexistence between apparently irreconcilable cultures, without conferring the leading role on either of them.&quot;

==Production==

=== Development and writing ===
Neil Peng approached director Ang Lee with the idea behind &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; in 1986 by revealing to Lee that one of their mutual friends had moved to the United States and was in a same-sex relationship without the knowledge of the man&#x27;s parents. Lee and Peng began writing the screenplay two years later and were soon joined by James Schamus. In the published screenplay version of the film, Schamus wrote that the film was &quot;first drafted in Chinese, then translated into English, re-written in English, translated back into Chinese, and eventually subtitled in Chinese and English and a dozen other languages.&quot; The script won a Taiwan state film competition in 1990.

=== Casting ===
&quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; was the debut film of Winston Chao, whom Ang Lee met on an airline where he was working as a flight attendant. Chao, who had no formal acting training, was reticent to take the part, until Lee agreed to coach him with an acting instructor of his choosing. Chao spent three-to-four hours each day before and during filming in in-depth rehearsals.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place entirely on-location in New York City. To keep the budget low, the production used free or public locations, including JFK International Airport, the Mayor&#x27;s Office of Film, Theatre &amp; Broadcasting, Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens, NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital, and cast and crew members&#x27; homes. The titular banquet scene was shot in the ballroom of a Sheraton Hotel near LaGuardia Airport.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; received positive reviews; on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Ang Lee&#x27;s funny and ultimately poignant comedy of manners reveals the filmmaker&#x27;s skill across genres.&quot; Alan Jones of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; said, &quot;Sharply observed and never once striking a false note, this sweet-and-sour rib-tickler is a real treat.&quot; Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;What makes the film work is the underlying validity of the story, the way the filmmakers don&#x27;t simply go for melodrama and laughs, but pay these characters their due. At the end of the film, I was a little surprised how much I cared for them.&quot;

The worldwide gross of &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; was $23.6 million. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported a budget of $750,000. Considering the $1 million budget reported by &quot;Variety&quot;, the film was also the most financially profitable movie of 1993, when considered in terms of ratios of return, while overall top grosser &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; only earned a ratio of 13.8 ($914 million earnings on a $60 million budget).

It was directed by John Tillinger, choreographed by Sergio Trujillo, with music by Woody Pak and book and lyrics by Brian Yorkey. Yorkey, Village&#x27;s associate artistic director, said this of the production, &quot;The film succeeds because of Ang Lee&#x27;s delicate poetry, and there is no way we can replicate that or translate that into a musical. So we took the story a step further. Whereas the film ends very ambiguously, our musical goes on past where the film ends&quot;. The show starred Welly Yang as Wai Tung.

<text>A physical disability is a limitation on a person&#x27;s physical functioning, mobility, dexterity or stamina. Other physical disabilities include impairments which limit other facets of daily living, such as respiratory disorders, blindness, epilepsy and sleep disorders.

== Causes ==
Prenatal disabilities are acquired before birth. These may be due to diseases or substances that the mother has been exposed to during pregnancy, embryonic or fetal developmental accidents or genetic disorders.

Perinatal disabilities are acquired between some weeks before to up to four weeks after birth in humans. These can be due to prolonged lack of oxygen or obstruction of the respiratory tract, damage to the brain during birth (due to the accidental misuse of forceps, for example) or the baby being born prematurely. These may also be caused due to genetic disorders or accidents.

Post-natal disabilities are gained after birth. They can be due to accidents, injuries, obesity, infection or other illnesses. These may also be caused due to genetic disorders.

== Types ==
Mobility impairment includes upper or lower limb loss or impairment, poor manual dexterity, and damage to one or multiple organs of the body. Disability in mobility can be a congenital or acquired problem or a consequence of disease. People who have a broken skeletal structure also fall into this category.

Visual impairment is another type of physical impairment. There are hundreds of thousands of people with minor to various serious vision injuries or impairments. These types of injuries can also result in severe problems or diseases such as blindness and ocular trauma. Some other types of vision impairment include scratched cornea, scratches on the sclera, diabetes-related eye conditions, dry eyes and corneal graft, macular degeneration in old age and retinal detachment.

Hearing loss is a partial or total inability to hear. Deaf and hard of hearing people have a rich culture and benefit from learning sign language for communication purposes. People who are only partially deaf can sometimes make use of hearing aids to improve their hearing ability.
Speech and language disability: the person with deviations of speech and language processes which are outside the range of acceptable deviation within a given environment and which prevent full social or educational development

Physical impairment can also be attributed to disorders causing, among others, sleep deficiency, chronic fatigue, chronic pain, and seizures.

<doc id="573321" wikidata="Q134980" url="?curid=573321" title="Serratia">
<text>Serratia is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. They are typically 1–5 μm in length, do not produce spores, and can be found in water, soil, plants, and animals. Some members of this genus produce a characteristic red pigment, prodigiosin, and can be distinguished from other members of the order Enterobacterales by their unique production of three enzymes: DNase (nucA), lipase, and gelatinase (serralysin). &quot;Serratia&quot; was thought to be a harmless environmental bacteria until it was discovered that the most common species in the genus, &quot;S. marcescens&quot;, is an opportunistic pathogen of many animals, including humans. In humans, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is mostly associated with nosocomial, or hospital-acquired, infections, but can also cause urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and endocarditis. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is frequently found in showers, toilet bowls, and around wet tiles as a pinkish to red biofilm but only causes disease in immunocompromised individuals. Aside from &quot;S. marcescens&quot;, some rare strains of the &quot;Serratia&quot; species – &quot;S. plymuthica&quot;, &quot;S. liquefaciens&quot;, &quot;S. rubidaea&quot;, and &quot;S. odoriferae&quot; – have been shown to cause infection such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis.

== Habitat ==
Various strains of &quot;Serratia&quot; occupy an eclectic range of habitats: soil, water, plants, insects, and others.

=== Water ===
Currently, four species of &quot;Serratia&quot; have been found in seawater: &quot;S. marcescens&quot;, &quot;S. liquefaciens&quot;, &quot;S. plymuthica&quot;, and &quot;S. marinorubra&quot;. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is the most abundant, comprising approximately half of all strains found. &quot;S. aquatilis&quot; is a novel species of &quot;Serratia&quot; found in drinking water.

=== Plants ===
The plant types with the highest &quot;Serratia&quot; prevalence are vegetables, mushrooms, mosses, grasses, and decaying plant material. &quot;Serratia&quot; has been consistently found in figs and coconuts. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; and &quot;S. ficaria&quot; are often found in Calimyrna figs. Several species related to &quot;Serratia&quot; have also been identified on Smyrna figs and its fig wasps. Only one species of &quot;Serratia&quot;, &quot;S. marinorubra&quot;, has been identified on coconuts from various regions of the world, including California, France, and Brazil. Both &quot;S. marcescens&quot; and certain strains of &quot;Enterobacter&quot; were also identified in the rhizospheres of coconut palms.

=== Insects ===
&quot;Serratia&quot; is found in over 70 species of healthy, dead, and diseased insects. These include crickets, grasshoppers, bees, aphids, and fruit flies. Most of them reside in insects as bacterial flora and some form mutualistic symbiotic relationships with their hosts. For example, in aphids, strains of &quot;S. symbiotica&quot; play a key nutritional role by providing the host with vitamins and amino acids.

In 2017 it was reported that &quot;Serratia&quot; can be genetically engineered to prevent malaria in mosquitos. Research showed 93% fewer &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites than in untreated counterparts.

== Isolation, identification, and metabolism ==

=== Isolation ===
&quot;S. marcescens&quot; is the most characterized species in this genus. During a hot summer in 1819 in Legnaro near Padua, Italy, the town people discovered that their polenta dish turned red. At first, the people believed that this incident was caused by the devil. A pharmacist named Bartolomeo Bizio was appointed to investigate the strange phenomenon. After several experiments, Bizzo presented his results. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; was first documented as a red-colored putrefaction of polenta by Bartolomeo Bizio in Padua. The bacterium was later named in honor of Italian physicist Serafino Serrati. In 1945, an experiment was designed to establish the pathogenicity of &quot;S. marcescens&quot;. Captain Tom Paine in the U.S. Army conducted an experiment at Camp Detrick, MD. In this experiment, he exposed four people to the bacteria in an enclosed space. The individuals soon developed symptoms such as body aches, malaise, green sputum production. A few of the individuals developed fever and chills while others still had a fever after 24 hours. Several other experiments were performed throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s to test the pathogenicity of &quot;S. marcescens&quot;, but it was not until the 1970s that &quot;S. marcescens&quot; was confirmed as a human pathogen.

&quot;S. liquefaciens&quot; is the second best characterized species after &quot;S. marcescens&quot;. &quot;S. liquefaciens&quot; was first classified as &quot;Aerobacter liquefaciens&quot; in the &quot;Enterobacter&quot; genus by Grimes and Hennerty. The first documentation of &quot;S. liquefaciens&quot; was in 1971. Over 20 isolates of &quot;S. liquefaciens&quot; were recovered from different specimens, such as urinary and respiratory. Out of the isolates, six were believed to cause infection in humans. From the 1970s to the 1980s, this species was the cause of several hospital outbreaks. However, the most well-known outbreak occurred in Colorado at a hemodialysis center. During this outbreak, there were 10 &quot;S. liquefaciens&quot; bloodstream infections.

&quot;S. ficaria&quot;, a species belonging to the fig tree community, can also be harmful to humans. In 1979, &quot;S. ficaria&quot; was first isolated from a patient who had a respiratory infection. The organism was isolated from the patient&#x27;s sputum after she consumed a fig. The organisms continued to be isolated from several humans over the years. The last documented infection caused by &quot;S. ficaria&quot; was in Greece. A healthy man was bitten by a dog, and the dog bite turned into an abscess. This was the first infection recorded in a healthy individual.

&quot;S. fonticola&quot; was first found in human specimens in 1985. It is known to cause tissue infections following trauma to the area. The first reported infection caused by &quot;S. fonticola&quot; was a leg abscess in a woman in France in 1989. In 1991, &quot;S. fonticola&quot; was the cause of a hand infection in another French woman. &quot;S. fonticola&quot; has been recovered from several other patients over the years.

There are not many reports of &quot;S. quinivoran&quot; causing infection in humans. A homeless man in France was admitted to the hospital with a mouth abscess. The man developed pneumonia and respiratory issues. &quot;S. quinivoran&quot; was recovered from a sample and was later identified as the cause of his organ failure and death. &quot;S. rubidaea&quot;, &quot;S. odorifera&quot;, and &quot;S. plymuthica&quot; are other &quot;Serratia&quot; species that are human pathogens. However, not all &quot;Serratia&quot; species are human pathogens. &quot;S. entomophia&quot; and &quot;S. proteamaculans&quot; are insect and plant pathogens.

=== Identification ===
Species of &quot;Serratia&quot; have been isolated in a variety of environments, including soil, water, plants, animals and even air. Several methods can be used to study the epidemiology of &quot;S. marcescens&quot;. Usual enrichment strategies involve the use of media containing antibiotic and antifungal substances. A caprylate-thallous medium seems to be highly preferred for the selective growth of genus &quot;Serratia&quot;, as it can use caprylic acid as a carbon source.

Serological typing and different types of polymerase chain reaction can be used to identify the &quot;Serratia&quot;. Biotyping, bacteriocin typing, phage typing, plasmid analysis, and ribotyping can also be used. Most strains of &quot;S. marcescens&quot; appear red on trypticase soy agar slants when grown at around 25 °C. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; and &quot;S. liquefaciens&quot; can be easily confused in the lab when using the analytical profile index system. They can both oxidise arabinose, but only &quot;S. liquefaciens&quot; can ferment arabinose in peptone water. The virulence of &quot;Serratia&quot; strains can also be identifiable by type 4 fimbriae, small hair-like projections.

==== Genome content ====
The average genome size of most &quot;Serratia&quot; species has not been documented except for that of &quot;S. marcescens&quot;, which is 3.57 × 109 daltons. The range of G+C content of each species is as follows: &quot;S. marcescens&quot; 57.5–60.4%, &quot;S. liquefaciens&quot; 52.6–54.4%, &quot;S. plymuthica&quot; 53.3–56.3%, &quot;S. marinorubra&quot; 53.5–58.5%. &quot;S. macescens&quot; genome has the highest G+C content among all enterobacteria.

==== Enzymes and biofilm ====
&quot;Serratia&quot; secretes a host of virulence factors, including prodigiosin, biosurfactants, DNAse, lipase, protease, gelatinase, hemolysin, chitinase, chloroperoxidase, and alkaline phosphatase. Prodigiosin, a growth pigment, is often used as a phenotypic identification marker of &quot;Serratia&quot; species due to its red colorization. Biosurfactants have been isolated from &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;, &quot;Serratia rubidaea&quot; and &quot;Serratia faciens&quot; for their range of applications, including emulsification, surface, antifouling, antitumor, and antimicrobial activity. Endonucleases, such as DNAse, may aid in scavenging activity, allowing them to exploit the environment and maximize the availability of nutrients. Strains producing thermostable lipase, alkaline protease and gelatinase have been isolated from strains causing contact lens-related corneal ulcers in humans. Due to its short half-life and tendency to remain bound to cells upon secretion, hemolysin has scarcely been identified in &quot;Serratia&quot;. However, some studies employing more accurate detection techniques have evidenced hemolytic activity in almost all strains of &quot;Serratia&quot;. Plant chitinases are used as defense mechanisms against plant pathogens with which &quot;Serratia&quot; shares their plant habitat. Chloroperoxidase allows the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds while alkaline phosphatases are involved in cell signaling processes.

=== Metabolism ===
&quot;Serratia&quot; uses a metabolic enzyme, ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase, with distinct kinetic properties from those found in Enterobacteriaceae in that it is not greatly activated by fructose bisphosphate. ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase from strains of &quot;S. marcescens&quot; demonstrated optimal activity in buffer at pH 7.5 and 8.0, respectively. It is greatly activated by glycolysis intermediates such as phosphoenolpyruvate, 3-phosphoglycerate, fructose-6-phosphate, and 2-phosphoglycerate.

== Pathology ==
Most &quot;Serratia&quot; species are nonpathogenic, but those that are pathogenic typically cause infection in immunocompromised individuals. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is the main pathogenic species, infecting animals and plants, but other species that have been reported to infect individuals include &quot;Serratia plymuthica,&quot; &quot;Serratia liquefaciens,&quot; &quot;Serratia rubidaea, Serratia odorifera,&quot; and &quot;Serratia fonticola&quot;.

=== Opportunistic human pathogen ===
&quot;S. marcescens&quot; is thought to be transmitted through hand-to-hand transmission; in one hospital half of all tested personnels&#x27; hands were found to be positive for the pathogen.

&quot;Serratia&quot; species tend to colonize the respiratory and urinary tracts, rather than the gastrointestinal tract. &quot;Serratia&quot; infection is responsible for about 2% of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections of the bloodstream, lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, surgical wounds, and skin and soft tissues and other ailments that are commonly caused by other bacteria. Outbreaks of &quot;S. marcescens&quot; meningitis, wound infections, and arthritis have occurred in pediatric wards. Outbreaks of infective endocarditis in IV drug users have been reported.

Cases of &quot;Serratia&quot; arthritis have been reported in outpatients receiving intra-articular injections.

=== Opportunistic non-human pathogen ===
There have been cases of &quot;Serratia&quot; non-human animal infections. One case of a non-nosocomial infection in animals was found in one study, after &quot;S. marcescens&quot; was found to be correlated with early abortions in buffalos and cows. The pathogen was isolated in culture after researchers observed reddish vaginal discharge from the cows, and the pathogen was also discovered to be in the semen of a bull, all of which were from the same strain.

=== Opportunistic plant pathogen ===
&quot;S. marcescens&quot; and &quot;S. proteamaculans&quot; are considered to be opportunistic plant pathogens. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; causes cucurbit yellow vine disease (CYVD). CYVD was first detected in pumpkin and squash. CYVD infects the phloem tissue in plants and causes wilting, yellowing, phloem discoloration, plant decline, and eventually death. CYVD mainly affects squash, cantaloupe, watermelon, etc. There have been studies that have shown that this disease is transmitted by insects. &quot;S. proteamaculans&quot; is the only other species known to cause harm to plants. &quot;S. proteamaculans&quot; is associated with leaf spot disease. Leaf spot disease is usually caused by a fungus, but can also be caused by bacteria (e.g. &quot;S. proteamaculans&quot;). Leaf spot disease appears as brown or dark spots on leaves and can permanently damage plants. The sizes and colors of these spots can vary.

<doc id="573323" wikidata="Q140004" url="?curid=573323" title="Serratia marcescens">
<text>Serratia marcescens () is a species of rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacteria in the family Yersiniaceae. It is a facultative anaerobe and an opportunistic pathogen in humans. It was discovered in 1819 by Bartolomeo Bizio in Padua, Italy. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is commonly involved in hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), also called nosocomial infections, particularly catheter-associated bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and wound infections, and is responsible for 1.4% of HAI cases in the United States. It is commonly found in the respiratory and urinary tracts of hospitalized adults and in the gastrointestinal systems of children.

Due to its abundant presence in the environment, and its preference for damp conditions, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is commonly found growing in bathrooms (especially on tile grout, shower corners, toilet water lines, and basins), where it manifests as a pink, pink-orange, or orange discoloration and slimy film feeding off phosphorus-containing materials or fatty substances such as soap and shampoo residue.

Once established, complete eradication of the organism is often difficult, but can be accomplished by application of a bleach-based disinfectant. Rinsing and drying surfaces after use can also prevent the establishment of the bacterium by removing its food source and making the environment less hospitable.

&quot;S. marcescens&quot; may also be found in environments such as dirt and the subgingival biofilm of teeth. Due to this, and because &quot;S. marcescens&quot; produces a reddish-orange tripyrrole dye called prodigiosin, it may cause staining of the teeth. The biochemical pathway for the production of prodigiosin by &quot;S. marcescens&quot; has been characterized by analyzing what intermediates become accumulated in specific mutants.

==Identification==
&quot;S. marcescens&quot; is a motile organism and can grow in temperatures ranging and in pH levels ranging from 5 to 9. It is differentiated from other Gram-negative bacteria by its ability to perform casein hydrolysis, which allows it to produce extracellular metalloproteinases which are believed to function in cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions. Since this bacterium is a facultative anaerobe, meaning that it can grow in either the presence of oxygen (i.e., aerobic growth) or in the absence of oxygen (i.e., anaerobic growth), it is capable of nitrate reduction under anoxic conditions. Therefore, nitrate tests are positive since nitrate is generally used as the final electron acceptor rather than oxygen. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; also exhibits tyrosine hydrolysis and citrate degradation. Citrate is used by &quot;S. marcescens&quot; to produce pyruvic acid, thus it can rely on citrate as a carbon source and test positive for citrate utilization. In identifying the organism, one may also perform a methyl red test, which determines if a microorganism performs mixed-acid fermentation. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; results in a negative test. Another determination of &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is its capability to produce lactic acid by oxidative and fermentative metabolism. Therefore, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is lactic acid O/F+.

==Pathogenicity==

In humans, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; can cause an opportunistic infection in several sites, including the urinary tract, respiratory tract, wounds, breasts, and the eye, where it may cause conjunctivitis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, and tear duct infections. It is also a rare cause of endocarditis and osteomyelitis (particularly in people who use intravenous drugs recreationally), pneumonia, and meningitis. Most &quot;S. marcescens&quot; strains are resistant to several antibiotics because of the presence of R-factors, which are a type of plasmid that carry one or more genes that encode resistance; all are considered intrinsically resistant to ampicillin, macrolides, and first-generation cephalosporins (such as cephalexin).

In elkhorn coral, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is the cause of the disease known as white pox disease. In silkworms, it can also cause a lethal disease, especially in association with other pathogens.

In research laboratories employing &quot;Drosophila&quot; fruit flies, infection of them with &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is common. It manifests as a pink discoloration or plaque in or on larvae, pupae, or the usually starch and sugar-based food (especially when improperly prepared).

A rare clinical form of gastroenteritis occurring in early infancy is caused by infection with&quot; S. marcescens&quot;. The red color of the diaper can be mistaken for hematuria (blood in the urine), which may cause unnecessary investigations by the physicians.

&quot;S. marcescens&quot; causes cucurbit yellow vine disease, leading to sometimes serious losses in melon fields.

Virulent strains of &quot;S. marcescens&quot; can impact honey bee colonies.

==History==

===Possible role in medieval miracles===
Because of its red pigmentation, caused by expression of the dye prodigiosin, and its ability to grow on bread, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; has been evoked as a naturalistic explanation of medieval accounts of the &quot;miraculous&quot; appearance of blood on the Corporal of Bolsena, though no formal testing of the corporal itself exists to confirm or deny this. The supposed miracle followed a celebration of Mass at Bolsena in 1263, led by a Bohemian priest who had doubts concerning transubstantiation, or the turning of bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ during the Mass. During the mass, the Eucharist appeared to bleed and each time the priest wiped away the blood, more would appear. This event is celebrated in a fresco in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican City, painted by Raphael.

===Discovery===
&quot;S. marcescens&quot; was discovered in 1819 by Venetian pharmacist Bartolomeo Bizio, as the cause of an episode of blood-red discoloration of polenta in the city of Padua. Bizio named the organism four years later in honor of Serafino Serrati, a physicist who developed an early steamboat; the epithet &quot;marcescens&quot; (Latin for &#x27;decaying&#x27;) was chosen because of the dyestuff&#x27;s rapid deterioration (Bizio&#x27;s observations led him to believe that the organism decayed into a mucilage-like substance upon reaching maturity). &quot;Serratia&quot; was later renamed &quot;Monas prodigiosus&quot; and &quot;Bacillus prodigiosus&quot; before Bizio&#x27;s original name was restored in the 1920s.

==Uses and misuse==

===Role in biowarfare testing===
Until the 1950s, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; was erroneously believed to be a nonpathogenic &quot;saprophyte&quot;, and its reddish coloration was used in school experiments to track infections. During the Cold War, it was used as a simulant in biological warfare testing by the U.S. military, which studied it in field tests as a substitute for the tularemia bacterium, which was being weaponized at the time.

On 26 and 27 September 1950, the U.S. Navy conducted a secret experiment named &quot;Operation Sea-Spray&quot; in which balloons filled with &quot;S. marcescens&quot; were released and burst over urban areas of the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Although the Navy later claimed the bacteria were harmless, beginning on September 29, 11 patients at a local hospital developed very rare, serious urinary tract infections. One of the afflicted patients, Edward J. Nevin, died. Cases of pneumonia in San Francisco also increased after &quot;S. marcescens&quot; was released. (That the simulant bacteria caused these infections and death has never been conclusively established.) Nevin&#x27;s son and grandson lost a lawsuit they brought against the government between 1981 and 1983, on the grounds that the government is immune, and that the chance that the sprayed bacteria caused Nevin&#x27;s death was minute. The bacterium was also combined with phenol and an anthrax simulant and sprayed across south Dorset by US and UK military scientists as part of the DICE trials which ran from 1971 to 1975.

Since 1950, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; has steadily increased as a cause of human infection, with many strains resistant to multiple antibiotics. The first indications of problems with the influenza vaccine produced by Chiron Corporation in 2004 involved &quot;S. marcescens&quot; contamination.

===Contaminated injectables===
In early 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a nationwide recall of one lot of Pre-Filled Heparin Lock Flush Solution USP. The heparin IV flush syringes had been found to be contaminated with &quot;S. marcescens&quot;, which resulted in patient infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed growth of &quot;S. marcescens&quot; from several unopened syringes of this product.

&quot;S. marcescens&quot; has also been linked to 19 cases in Alabama hospitals in 2011, including 10 deaths. All of the patients involved were receiving total parenteral nutrition at the time; the two pharmacists responsible for formulating the solution were criminally charged.

===Ground-water flow tracing===
Because of its ability to be grown on agar plates into even, well coloured lawns, and the existence of a phage specific to &quot;S. marscecens&quot;, it has been used to trace water flows in karst limestone systems. Known quantities of phage are injected into a fixed point in the karst water system and the outflows of interest are monitored by conventional small-volume sampling at fixed time intervals. In the laboratory, the samples are poured onto grown &quot;S. marscecens&quot; lawns and incubated. Colourless plaques in the lawns indicate the presence of phage. The method was claimed to be sensitive at very high dilutions because of the ability to detect single phage particles.

== Treatment and antibiotic resistance ==
Traditionally, infections by &quot;S. marcescens&quot; have been treated with cefepime, carbapenems (Siedner et al., 2014; Tamma et al., 2022 as cited in Tavares-Carreon et al., 2023), aminoglycoside amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin (Bertrand &amp; Dowzicky, 2012; Sader et al., 2014 as cited in Tavares-Carreon et al., 2023). However, recent clinical data has shown declining efficacy for gentamicin and tobramycin, part of a trend towards increasing resistance and a narrowing of treatment options. The development of these resistances to common antibiotics is partially due to adaptive resistance through overexposure and selection of resistant strains, but &quot;S. marcescens&quot; also has intrinsic resistance from sources such as lipopolysaccharide modifications, which can reduce antibiotic penetration, and adaptive resistance through biofilm production (Tavares-Carreon et al., 2023). Biofilm production increases antibiotic resistance because bacteria at the bottom of the biofilm are less exposed to antibiotics, the bacteria in the biofilm do not grow as quickly, and there are faster rates of horizontal gene transfer which allows resistance genes to spread easily within the population. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed &quot;Serratia&quot; as among the most critical group of bacteria for which new antibiotics are urgently needed due to its resistance to multiple drugs and threat to hospitals, nursing homes, and patients who use ventilators and blood catheters.

&quot;S. marcescens&quot; skin infections are uncommon, but may be suspected in cases of cellulitis in immunocompromised individuals, particularly when conventional antibiotics are ineffective. &quot;S. marcescens&quot; is naturally resistant to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid due to the fact that it produces a cephalosporinase enzyme. It is also resistant to many other antibiotics, including penicillin, cephalosporin, tetracycline, macrolide, nitrofurantoin, and colistin. Broad-spectrum antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and imipenem/cilastatin are indicated for treatment of &quot;S. marcescens&quot; skin infections. Surgery may also be considered if antibiotics are not rapidly effective.

== Biofilms ==
Phloretin may reduce the virulence of &quot;S. marcescens&quot; by disrupting quorum sensing and biofilm formation.
 When treated with chloramphenicol, &quot;S. marcescens&quot; biofilms demonstrated significant reductions in growth.

<text>Crespi d&#x27;Adda is a village in northern Italy and hamlet (&quot;frazione&quot;) of Capriate San Gervasio, a municipality in the province of Bergamo, Lombardy. It is a historic settlement and an outstanding example of the 19th and early 20th-century &quot;company towns&quot; built in Europe and North America by enlightened industrialists to meet the workers&#x27; needs. The site is still intact and is partly used for industrial purposes, although changing economic and social conditions now threaten its survival. Since 1995 it has been on UNESCO&#x27;s list of World Heritage Sites.

==History==
===19th century===

In 1869 Cristoforo Benigno Crespi, a textile manufacturer from Busto Arsizio (Varese), bought the valley between the rivers Brembo and Adda, to the south of Capriate, with the intention of installing a cotton mill on the banks of the Adda.

Cristoforo Crespi introduced the most modern spinning, weaving and finishing processes in his Cotton Mill. The hydroelectric power plant in Trezzo, on the Adda river just a few kilometers upwards, was built up around 1906 for the manufacturer Cristoforo Benigno Crespi. The settlement which was built in 1878 next to the cotton-mill was a village, a residential area provided with social services such as a clinic, a school building, a theatre, a cemetery, a wash-house and a church.

Both the town and the factory were illuminated thanks to electric light. The village of Crespi d&#x27;Adda was the first village in Italy to have modern public lighting. The workers houses, of English inspiration, are lined up in order along parallel roads to the east of the factory. A tree-lined avenue separates the production zone from the houses, overlooking a chequer-board road plan. The whole architecture and town planning (except the first spinning department, created by engineer Angelo Colla), was submitted to the architect Ernesto Pirovano. For about fifty years Pirovano, helped by the engineer Pietro Brunati, ran the construction of the village. model shops toy-like constructions / miniatures had been made to educate and exemplify new trends in social thinking and scientific advances to the inhabitants in the form of suitcases that contained them.

In 1889 the son of Cristoforo, Silvio Benigno Crespi, started work in the factory as a director, after spending time in Oldham, England. He turned away from the large multiple-occupancy blocks in favour of the single-family house, with its own garden, which he saw as conducive to harmony and a defence against industrial strife. He put this policy into practice in 1892 and the years that followed, with success, since there was no strike or other forms of social disorder for the fifty years of Crespi management.

===20th century===
The Great Depression of 1929 and the harsh fascist fiscal policy resulted in the Crespi family being obliged to sell the entire town to STI, &quot;the Italian textile enterprise&quot;, which transferred it to the &quot;Rossarl e Varzi company&quot; in 1970. It then passed to the &quot;Legler company&quot;, which sold off most of the houses. It was last in the hands of the &quot;Polli industrial group&quot;, which employed some 600 people, as compared with the 3200 employed during the years of maximum activity.

Today the village is inhabited by a community largely descended from the original workers. The factory stopped production only in 2004, its field of activity throughout its working life having been cotton textile production.

In October 2013, it was announced that Antonio Percassi was purchasing Crespi d&#x27;Adda in order to convert it into the headquarters for the Percassi Business group as well as the headquarters for the new Antonio Percassi Family Foundation.

==Geography==
The village is located by the eastern shore of the river Adda, next to the provincial borders of Bergamo with Milan, south of Capriate San Gervasio. Other nearest settlements are Trezzo sull&#x27;Adda, Brembate, Vaprio d&#x27;Adda and Canonica d&#x27;Adda. It is from Bergamo and its airport, from Monza and from Milan. Nearest motorway exit, &quot;Capriate&quot;, is north and is part of the A4 motorway Turin-Trieste.

== Monuments and Places of Interest ==

=== Religious Architecture ===

The parish church was built starting from 1891 under the direction of the engineer Pietro Brunati and it was opened in November 1893 with the inauguration by the bishop Gaetano Camillo Guindani. The church is the reconstruction of the Marian shrine in Busto Arsizio. The church was dedicated to S.Maria dell&#x27;Aiuto and dates back to 1517. The designer is unknown, but some important architects and sculptors, such as Lonati and Tommaso Rodari, worked on it. This church represents the ideal link between the hometown of the Crespi family, Busto Arsizio, and the village, which represented the best expression of the textile industrial sector.

The parish church in Crespi d&#x27;Adda has a square plan with a base made up with Adda strain and it ends with a large octagonal dome externally surrounded by a white marble loggia. Inside there are a lot of frescos and canvas directly commissioned by Cristoforo Crespi.

Still today, the church is used by the local population for ordinary religious rites.

=== The cemetery ===
The works for the construction of the cemetery started in 1905 commissioned by Cristoforo Crespi and it was ready in November 1908. The cemetery is a monumental construction where the mausoleum, dedicated to the Crespi family, is the main core. In the mausoleum there are the graves of the members of the family.

=== The castle ===

The castle in Crespi was built between 1893 and 1894. The castle was the manor house of the family and its style is typical of the Medieval architecture of the XII century. The architect was Ernesto Pirovano.

The manor house was the summer residence of the family.

At the end of 1960, the municipality of Capriate San Gervasio got the property of the building. From 1968 to 1981 it became the secondary school of the village and afterwards a professional institute. In 1977 the building was sold to some private buyers. All these different usages implied some important changes in the architectural structure and in the decorative styles.

Today, the building has been declared real estate of historical interest.

=== The factory and the houses ===
The factory started its activity in July 1878 and its production was totally dedicated to the cotton processing and the production of textiles. With Silvio Crespi there was an enlargement of the factory, thanks to the project made by Pietro Brunati, and there was a new inauguration in 1894 at the presence of Queen Margherita. The new productive lines began to work systematically in 1896. This factory was the centre of the village and all the inhabitants worked there. The factory was the working core of the village and the life of the workers depended on the factory production. Every person in the village had his own house and they were all the same, except for the managers, the doctor and the priest who had more luxurious ones. Initially, in the project of Cristoforo Crespi, there was no idea of a hierarchy, but the situation developed because the social environment of the time changed and showed different levels of wealth.  Throughout its history, the factory underwent several structural changes in order to adjust to changes in industrial production and manufacturing of textile.

In 1973 Legler, a textile company, bought the factory and started to work until 2003, when the factory closed because of bankruptcy.

Today the factory is an open air museum of industrial archeology.

<text>The Handley Page HP.52 Hampden is a British twin-engine medium bomber that was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was part of the trio of large twin-engine bombers procured for the RAF, joining the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley and Vickers Wellington. The Hampden was powered by Bristol Pegasus radial engines but a variant known as the Handley Page Hereford had in-line Napier Daggers.

The Hampden served in the early stages of the Second World War, bearing the brunt of the early bombing war over Europe, taking part in the first night raid on Berlin and the first 1,000-bomber raid on Cologne. When it became obsolete, after a period of mainly operating at night, it was retired from RAF Bomber Command service in late 1942. By 1943, the rest of the trio were being superseded by the larger four-engined heavy bombers such as the Avro Lancaster.

==Development==
===Origins===
In 1932, the Air Ministry issued Specification B.9/32 seeking a twin-engined day bomber with higher performance than any preceding bomber aircraft. Handley Page and Vickers both designed aircraft to meet this specification, the Vickers design became the Wellington. The Handley Page design team, led by George Volkert, drafted a radical aircraft, initially centering upon the politically favoured Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine. By mid-1934 development of the Goshawk looked less promising and the Air Ministry relaxed the tare weight (unloaded weight) requirement of the specification, allowing for the use of heavier and more powerful radial engines such as the Bristol Perseus and Bristol Pegasus. According to aviation author Philip J.R. Moyes, the Handley Page design soon found support with the Air Ministry in part because it was judged to represent a fair compromise between range, payload, and speed.

During early 1936, the first prototype, designated as the HP.52 and given the serial number &quot;K4240&quot;, was completed. On seeing the narrow-yet-deep fuselage, which was only 3 ft wide, C. G. Grey, founder of &quot;The Aeroplane&quot; magazine, remarked &quot;it looks like a flying suitcase&quot;, a nickname that stuck with the aircraft for its lifetime. On 21 June 1936, the prototype, powered by a pair of Bristol Pegasus P.E.5S(A) engines, conducted its maiden flight from Radlett Aerodrome, Hertfordshire, piloted by Handley-Page chief test pilot Major James Cordes. In late June 1936, the prototype was put on public display in the New Types Park, Hendon Air Show, London. In August 1936, in response to the successful flight trials performed by &quot;K4240&quot;, the Air Ministry issued an initial production order for the type, ordering 180 production aircraft to be manufactured to meet Specification B.30/36; concurrently, a second order for 100 aircraft powered by the Napier Dagger was issued to Belfast-based Short &amp; Harland.

In early 1937, a second prototype, which received the serial number &quot;L7271&quot;, was completed; this second prototype had several differences from the first, including the pitot tube being repositioned below the fuselage, a more rounded ventral defensive gun position, and a slightly modified nose. &quot;L7271&quot; later received a pair of Dagger engines and was accordingly re-designated as the &quot;HP.53&quot;; on 1 July 1937, it performed its first flight after having received the new engines. Another prototype, &quot;L4032&quot;, was produced to serve as the production-standard prototype; on 24 June 1938, the third prototype conducted its maiden flight. &quot;L4032&quot; differed from the previous two prototypes in that it was powered by a pair of Pegasus XVIII engines, the nose incorporated an optically flat bomb-aiming panel, as well as the ventral and dorsal gun positions being revised.

On 24 June 1938, &quot;L4032&quot; was officially christened by Lady Katharine Mary Montagu-Douglas-Scott, Viscountess Hampden, at a ceremony held in Radlett Aerodrome, the same day on which its first flight took place. Viscountess Hampden&#x27;s speech invoked &quot;the spirit of John Hampden, the defender of civil liberties&quot; to inspire future crews of his namesake aircraft. &quot;L4032&quot; and &quot;L4033&quot;, which was the second production-standard Hampden to be produced, would be later assigned to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath, Suffolk. On 20 September 1938, the third production Hampden, designated &quot;L4034&quot;, following the completion of handling trials conducted by the Central Flying School at Upavon Aerodrome, Wiltshire, become the first aircraft to enter RAF squadron service, being delivered to No. 49 Squadron.

===Production===
By late 1938, the mass manufacturing plans for the Hampden had been formalised. In addition to Handley-Page&#x27;s own production line, the type was to be built under subcontract by English Electric at its factory in Preston, Lancashire; on 6 August 1938, English Electric was awarded an initial contract to manufacture 75 Hampdens. In addition, Canadian interest in domestic production of the type had resulted in the establishment of the joint Anglo-Canadian Canadian Associated Aircraft company, which promptly received an initial order from the RAF for 80 Hampdens to be completed in Canada; this facility would effectively act as a shadow factory during wartime. On 1 September 1938, in response to interest expressed by the Royal Swedish Air Force (RSAF) in the Hampden, including in a potential licence production arrangement for 70 aircraft to be built in Sweden, a single production Hampden was supplied to Sweden. Designated &quot;P.5&quot; by the RSAF, it was operated by the service until November 1945, after which it was sold to Svenska Aeroplan AB (SAAB) to serve as a flying testbed before being retired in late 1947.

On 22 February 1940, the first Preston-built Hampden, &quot;P2062&quot;, conducted its maiden flight. English Electric would go on to manufacture a total of 770 Hampdens, more than any other company, before delivering its final aircraft on 15 March 1942. In July 1940, Handley-Page terminated its own production line for the Hampden upon the completion of its 500th aircraft. On 9 August 1940, the first Canadian-built Hampden, &quot;P5298&quot;, made its debut flight; by October 1940, Canadian production had risen to 15 aircraft per month. A total of 160 Hampdens were completed by Canadian Associated Aircraft, many of which were ferried to the United Kingdom for wartime service. The final Canadian-built aircraft was delivered in late 1941.

==Design==
The Hampden Mk I had a pilot, navigator/bomb aimer, radio operator and rear gunner. Conceived as a fast, manoeuvrable &quot;fighting bomber&quot;, the Hampden had a fixed forward-firing .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine gun in the upper part of the fuselage nose. To avoid the weight penalties of powered turrets, the Hampden had a curved Perspex nose fitted with a manual .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers K machine gun and a .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers K installation in the rear upper and lower positions. The layout was similar to the all-guns-forward cockpits introduced about the same time in &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; medium bombers, notably the Dornier Do 17. During the Norwegian Campaign, these guns proved to be thoroughly inadequate for self-defence in daylight; the single guns were replaced by twin Vickers K guns, a process led by Air Vice Marshal Arthur Harris of No. 5 Group RAF in 1940.

The Hampden had a flush-rivetted stressed skin, reinforced with a mixture of bent and extruded sections in an all-metal monocoque design. A split-assembly construction technique was employed: sections were prefabricated and then joined, to enable rapid and economic manufacture. The fuselage was in three big sections – front, centre and rear – that were built using jigs. The centre and rear sections were made of two halves, which meant that the sections could be fitted out in part under better working conditions prior to assembly. All possible assembly work was performed at the benches prior to installation upon each aircraft.

The wings were made up of three large units: centre section, port outer wing and starboard outer wing, which were also subdivided. Each section was built around a main girder spar, leading edge section and trailing edge section. The wing made use of wingtip slots and hydraulically actuated trailing edge flaps; the flaps and ailerons had stress-bearing &quot;D&quot;-spars. According to Moyes, the configuration of the wing was a key feature of Hampden, being highly tapered and designed to exert low levels of drag; these attributes were responsible for the aircraft&#x27;s high top speed for the era of while retaining a reasonably low landing speed of .

The Hampden&#x27;s flying qualities were typically described as being favourable; Moyes described it as being &quot;extraordinarily mobile on the controls&quot;. Pilots were provided with a high level of external visibility, assisting the execution of steep turns and other manoeuvres. The control layout required some familiarisation, as some elements such as the hydraulic controls were unobtrusive and unintuitive. Upon introduction, the Hampden exhibited greater speeds and initial climb rates than any of its contemporaries while still retaining favourable handling qualities.

The slim and compact fuselage of the aircraft was quite cramped, being wide enough only for a single person. The navigator sat behind the pilot and access in the cockpit required folding down the seats. Once in place, the crew had almost no room to move and were typically uncomfortable during long missions. Aircrews referred to the Hampden by various nicknames due to this, such as &quot;Flying Suitcase&quot;, &quot;Panhandle&quot;, and &quot;Flying Tadpole&quot;. Wilfred John Lewis wrote:

The newest of the three medium bombers, the Hampden was often referred to by aircrews as the &quot;Flying Suitcase&quot; because of its cramped crew conditions, or more plausibly, because of the unusually thin, deep, slab-sided and rectangular shape of the fuselage was reminiscent of that of a suitcase.

==Operational history==

===UK service===
In September 1938, No. 49 Squadron received the first Hampdens; by the end of the year, both 49 and 83 Squadrons at RAF Scampton had re-equipped with the type. A total of 226 Hampdens were in service with ten squadrons by the start of the Second World War, with six forming the operational strength of 5 Group of Bomber Command based in Lincolnshire.

With the outbreak of war in 1939, Hampdens were initially used to perform armed aerial reconnaissance missions, observing German naval activity during daylight. However, despite its speed and manoeuvrability, the Hampden proved to be no match for &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighters; in December 1939, Bomber Command is claimed to have discarded the belief that aircraft such as the Hampden could realistically operate by day and instead chose to predominantly employ them under the cover of darkness during nighttime operations. During 1940, Hampdens of 5 Group conducted 123 nighttime airborne leaflet propaganda missions, losing only a single aircraft in the process.

On 13 April 1940, days after Germany&#x27;s invasion of Norway, a large number of Hampdens were dispatched on night-time mine-laying (code-named &quot;gardening&quot;) flights in the North Sea in areas deemed unapproachable by British shipping. According to Moyes, this activity proved highly effective, experiencing a low casualty rate of less than 1.9 aircraft per mission. The Hampden also saw a return to its use as a daytime bomber during the Norwegian Campaign, but quickly proved to be under-gunned in the face of German fighters.

On 19 March 1940, Hampdens took part in the first deliberate bombing of German soil in a nighttime raid upon the seaplane hangars and slipways in Hörnum, Sylt. The type continued to operate at night on bombing raids over Germany. Flight Lieutenant Rod Learoyd of 49 Squadron was awarded the Victoria Cross for a low-level attack on the Dortmund-Ems canal on 12 August 1940 where two of five aircraft failed to return. On 25 August 1940, Hampdens from various squadrons participated in the RAF&#x27;s first bombing raid on Berlin. Sergeant John Hannah was the wireless operator/air gunner of an 83 Squadron Hampden and was awarded the Victoria Cross on 15 September 1940, when he fought the flames of the burning aircraft, allowing the pilot to return it to base.

In April 1942, the Hampden-equipped 144 Squadron and 455 Squadron RAAF were transferred from Bomber Command to Coastal Command to perform the torpedo bomber role. Later that year, detachments from both squadrons were dispatched to Vaenga airfield, Murmansk, Russia, to help safeguard the Arctic convoys in the vicinity. A total of four squadrons assigned to Coastal Command would be equipped with Hampdens. These squadrons continued to use the type into late 1943; the last Coastal Command squadron transitioned from the type on 10 December 1943.

Almost half of the Hampdens built, 714, were lost on operations, with 1,077 crew killed and 739 reported as missing. German &quot;Flak&quot; accounted for 108, one hit a German barrage balloon, 263 Hampdens crashed because of &quot;a variety of causes&quot; and 214 others were classed as &quot;missing&quot;. &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilots claimed 128 Hampdens, shooting down 92 at night.

The last Bomber Command sorties by Hampdens were flown on the night of 14/15 September 1942 by 408 Squadron, RCAF against Wilhelmshaven. After being withdrawn from Bomber Command in 1942, it operated with RAF Coastal Command until 1943 as a long-range torpedo bomber (the Hampden TB Mk I with a Mk XII torpedo in an open bomb bay and a bomb under each wing) and as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft.

===Non-UK service===

The Hampden was also used by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), &quot;Aviatsiya Voenno-Morskogo Flota&quot; (AV-MF: Maritime Military Fleet Aviation) of the Soviet Union and the Swedish &quot;Flygvapnet&quot; (Air Force).

The Hampden in RCAF service included the 160 examples manufactured in Canada by the Canadian Associated Aircraft consortium. Of the total built, 84 were shipped by sea to Great Britain, while the remainder came to Patricia Bay (Victoria Airport) B.C., to set up No. 32 OTU (RAF) used for bombing and gunnery training. Typical exercises at 32 OTU consisted of patrolling up the West Coast of Vancouver Island at night or flying out into the Pacific to a navigational map co-ordinate, often in adverse and un-forecast inclement weather. Due to attrition from accidents, about 200 &quot;war weary&quot; Hampdens were later flown from the U.K. to Patricia Bay as replacements.

In Operation Orator, during September 1942, the crews of 32 Hampden TB.1 torpedo bombers from No. 144 Squadron RAF and No. 455 Squadron RAAF flew to Northwest Russia, to protect arctic convoy PQ 18 from German surface vessels, such the battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The Hampden crews flew from Sumburgh in the Shetland Islands to Vaenga (Vayenga; later known as Severomorsk) in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. This was a hazardous route, often subject to poor weather and spanning more than , partly over enemy-occupied territory in Norway and Finland. Eight Hampdens were lost or damaged beyond repair en route. 144 and 455 Squadrons flew a small number of sorties from Vaenga. While it was originally intended that the Hampdens would be flown back to Scotland, the prevailing west–east headwinds on such a flight might have pushed the Hampdens beyond their maximum endurance and it was decided to transport the wing&#x27;s personnel back to Britain by sea and gift the Hampdens to the Soviet Navy.

Aircrews and mechanics from Maritime Military Fleet Aviation (&quot;Aviatsiya Voenno-Morskogo Flota&quot;; VMF) were trained by members of 144 and 455 Squadrons, before their return to Britain in October. The 3rd Squadron, 24th Mine-Torpedo Aviation Regiment (24 Минно-торпедный авиаполк; &quot;24 MTAP&quot;) operated the &quot;balalaika&quot; – the Russian nickname for the Hampden, in reference to its unusual shape – until mid-1943, when losses, a lack of replacements and a shortage of spares forced its retirement. &quot;24 MTAP&quot; then reverted to the Ilyushin DB-3/Ilyushin Il-4.

In Sweden, the &quot;Flygvapnet&quot; assigned an HP.52 to Reconnaissance Wing F 11 at Nyköping for evaluation, under the designation P5. After the war, the aircraft was sold to SAAB where it was used as an avionics testbed.

==Variants==

The Hampden was powered by two Bristol Pegasus XVIII nine-cylinder radial engines. A Mk II variant, designated the HP.62, was developed by converting two Hampdens to use the Wright Cyclone engine in 1940, but no further work was done on that project.

Interest in the HP.52 by the Swedish Air Force led to the creation of the HP.53 prototype, which was subsequently used as a testbed for a pair of Napier Dagger VIII 24-cylinder H-block air-cooled inline engines.

In August 1936, the Air Ministry placed an order for 100 Hampdens equipped with the Dagger engine. Those aircraft subsequently received the designation &quot;HP.53&quot;, along with the name &quot;Hereford&quot;. Manufactured by Short &amp; Harland in Belfast, their performance was almost identical to that of their Hampden cousins, but there were problems with the engines. The Dagger engine proved to be noisy and unreliable. Cooling problems plagued the engine while being run on the ground, resulting in distortions and premature failures. The problems were not satisfactorily resolved, with the result that most of the Herefords on order were converted to Hampdens, while those that were constructed were often re-engined to become Hampdens. A limited number of Herefords did enter squadron service but were only used by training units.

==Survivors==

No Hampdens remain in flying condition today, although examples do remain on display or undergoing restoration:

Hampden I &quot;P1344&quot;
:Recovered from a crash-site in Russia in 1991, the aircraft is being reconstructed at the Michael Beetham Conservation Centre at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. During the Second World War, it served with No. 144 Squadron RAF, part of Coastal Command. In September 1942, the squadron was transferred to the Kola Peninsula in northern Russia to help protect the Arctic convoys. While in transit over Finland, P1344 accidentally flew close by a German airfield and was shot down by two scrambled Messerschmitt Bf 109s. It crashed in a wooded area of the Kola Peninsula, with three crew members killed and two taken prisoner. After its recovery by another party, the RAF Museum gained ownership of the aircraft in 1992. It was reported in 2016 that, with the help of volunteers, work on the fuselage could be completed by 2018.
:An update in October 2020 stated that &quot;aircraft now has all four fuselage components fully assembled, attached and painted in its original 144 Squadron colour scheme and serial number&quot;. It was expected to be moved to the RAF Museum London.

Hampden, &quot;P5436&quot;
: This aircraft has been reconstructed largely from parts of the last Canadian-built example, ditched on a training flight in November 1942 when the pilot lost control after a practice torpedo drop. The remains were recovered from 600 ft of water in Saanich Inlet on Vancouver Island in 1989. Along with recovered components from two other Hampden crashes in Canada, reconstruction was about 97 per cent complete by 2007. The restored aircraft became the showpiece exhibit at the Canadian Museum of Flight at Langley, British Columbia, in the Fraser Valley, east of Vancouver.
:In January 2009, a heavy snowfall snapped off the aircraft&#x27;s left wing. Despite the efforts of Museum staff to clear the accumulating snow, the wing&#x27;s internal structure failed and the wing separated from the fuselage, falling onto a display case containing one of the aircraft&#x27;s original engines. The wing suffered considerable damage and there was additional damage to the tail and propeller. The wing had largely been restored using wood parts because most of the metal parts of the wing structure had corroded so it did not possess the structural integrity of the original aircraft. The museum is currently seeking donations to repair the aircraft. The repairs, in 2011, included the mating of the wing and propeller to the fuselage and engine. As of November 2013, the repairs to the CMF Handley Page Hampden have been completed. The wing has been re-secured and the complete aircraft has been repainted. By 20 April 2015 the two gunner sections were open.

The Wings Aviation Museum in the United Kingdom owns the wings and tail of &quot;P1273&quot;; the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre is currently restoring AE436 to flying condition. Both of these were also 144 Squadron aircraft, lost during the transfer to Russia. The former, &quot;P1273&quot; was shot down by mistake by Soviet fighters over Petsamo. The latter was lost over Sweden, its remains discovered in a remote region by hikers in 1976.

==In popular culture==
The HP Hampden had a featured role in &quot;The Big Blockade&quot;, a 1941 Second World War propaganda film showing &quot;blockade&quot; bombing and its effects on the German war industry, with Michael Rennie and John Mills as two of its four-man crew.

<doc id="573330" wikidata="Q57620" url="?curid=573330" title="Lawrence Gonzi">
<text>Lawrence Gonzi (born 1 July 1953) is a Maltese politician, retired Nationalist politician and lawyer, who served for twenty-five years in various critical roles in Maltese politics. Gonzi was Prime Minister of Malta from 2004 to 2013, and leader of the Nationalist Party. He also served as speaker of the House from 1988 to 1996, and Minister of Social Policy from 1998 to 2004, as well as deputy prime minister from 1999 to 2004. He served in practically all positions in Parliament, being also Leader of the House, an MP and Leader of the Opposition.

Taking over as prime minister from Eddie Fenech Adami, Lawrence Gonzi led the islands through the delicate first years of EU membership. He piloted crucial economic and political reforms, spearheaded Malta&#x27;s adoption of the euro, and the entry into force of the Schengen agreement. His decision to privatise the Malta shipyards, and the pensions reform, proved to be unpopular. Following a razor-thin electoral victory in 2008, perceptions of arrogance in his cabinet, fomented by the Labour Party opposition and rebel backbenchers, dented his second term of office. Following the loss of a financial vote, his government lost supply in December 2012. The Nationalist party went on to lose the successive general election, leading to Gonzi&#x27;s resignation and eventual retirement from politics.

Gonzi stressed the need to ensure sustainable development and environmental stewardship on the islands, also focusing on strengthening the education and healthcare sectors. In international diplomacy, Gonzi was lauded for his role in the Libyan Revolution, breaking Malta&#x27;s long relationship with the Gaddafi regime, and siding with the rebels. Additionally, his humanitarian response to the migratory pressures enfolding around Malta led to the first voluntary European migrant burden sharing pact. He was also highly regarded by EU leaders who worked by his side during his nine years as prime minister.

== Family and early life ==
Lawrence Gonzi was born on 1 July 1953, in Valletta, British Malta, the son of Luigi Gonzi (1919–2010) and Ines Gonzi (&quot;née&quot; Galea) (1921–2008). He is the grandnephew of Mikiel Gonzi, Archbishop of Malta from 1944 until 1976. His younger brother, Michael Gonzi, is a Nationalist backbencher. Gonzi spent his childhood years in the youth section of the local Catholic Action organisation, the &quot;Circolo Gioventù Cattolica.&quot;

He began his education at the Archbishop&#x27;s Seminary in Floriana, continuing his studies there until sitting for his matriculation exams. Gonzi attended the University of Malta, studying law and graduating as a lawyer in 1975. After practicing law in a private firm, he worked as a company lawyer with the Mizzi Organisation, serving as group chairman between 1989 and 1997. Gonzi is very active in the voluntary sector, particularly in areas relating to disability and mental health issues. His strong commitment to his Catholic faith led him to join the Malta Catholic Action Movement, serving as its general president between 1976 and 1986. He was also the first chairman of the &quot;Kummissjoni Nazzjonali Persuni b’ Diżabilità&quot; (KNPD), a national commission for persons with disability.

He is married to Catherine &quot;Kate&quot; Gonzi, &quot;née&quot; Callus. The couple have three children (David, Mikela and Paul), five grandchildren and live in Marsascala.

==Political career==
===Speaker of the House of Representatives===

The political and religious turmoil in Malta during the 1980s moved him to get involved in local politics. After unsuccessfully contesting the 1987 general election with the Nationalist Party, Gonzi was appointed Speaker of the House of Representatives on 10 October 1988. In 1992, his re-appointment to the post was proposed by the Prime Minister, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition and approved unanimously by the House on 4 April 1992.

During his term as Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gonzi overhauled the methods with which Parliament operated, including the set up of its permanent committees. He also introduced new procedures with regards to the timing of debates between the two sides of the House. His tenure as Speaker of the House of Representatives exposed his modest but firm bearing, which calming fraying tempers in difficult moments for the house.

===Member of Parliament===
Gonzi contested the October 1996 general elections and was elected to Parliament on 29 October 1996. In November 1996, he was appointed as Whip for the Opposition, secretary to the Opposition Parliamentary Group, and Shadow Minister for Social Policy. The following year, he was elected Secretary General of the Nationalist Party. After the Nationalist Party won the 1998 election, Gonzi was appointed Minister for Social Policy and Leader of the House of Representatives on 8 September 1998. He also served as deputy prime minister from May 1999 to March 2004.

His negotiating skills and business acumen helped in restructuring the local economy. As Minister for Social Policy, he was driving force behind many social and economic reforms including two milestones which revolutionised social dialogue and industrial relations in Malta. With an economy which was being reformed and opened up in the run-up to Malta&#x27;s accession to the European Union, the need to overhaul industrial relations legislation became pressing. Gonzi drafted and piloted a new act of parliament, the Employment and Industrial Relations Act (2002). He was also instrumental in setting up the framework for the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development, enabling social partners to make recommendations on social and economic matters. These employment and industrial relations reforms were applied to the restructuring of the Malta shipyards, and the introduction of a stringent zero-tolerance policy for benefit fraud.

Gonzi was re-elected in the 2003 election, and appointed as deputy prime minister and Minister for Social Policy on 15 April 2003.

===Prime minister===
Following the resignation of Eddie Fenech Adami as party leader, a party leadership contest was held in March 2004. Nominations opened for a week on 9 February. Gonzi, John Dalli and Louis Galea submitted their nominations, with the first round of elections held on 28 February. Gonzi obtained 508 party delegate votes (59.3 percent), Dalli polled 219 votes (25.3 percent) and Galea received 133 (15.4 percent). Galea was eliminated after placing third, and Dalli withdrew his candidature, leaving Gonzi to face the second round of voting alone on 3 March. Lawrence Gonzi was elected leader, obtaining 808 of the 859 votes cast, securing 94.1 per cent of the vote.

Lawrence Gonzi was appointed prime minister and Minister of Finance on 23 March 2004. George W. Bush, Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, and Pope John Paul II, and many other foreign leaders, congratulated Lawrence Gonzi on his new, important responsibilities at a critical time in Malta&#x27;s history. Malta joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, and as prime minister, Gonzi attended the EU enlargement official ceremony which took place in Dublin, Ireland, where the Maltese flag was hoisted for the first time alongside those of the other member states.

Gonzi, in his responsibility for the finance portfolio, successfully managed the process to achieve the Maastricht convergence criteria, allowing Malta to join the Eurozone on 1 January 2008. He also embarked upon a drive to improve the management of public finances, focused sharply upon improving Malta&#x27;s competitiveness in the international market and accelerated the restructuring process of the public sector. Gonzi stressed the importance to attract high-value added sectors of the economy, particularly information technology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. His negotiating skills were crucial in Malta obtaining €2.4 billion in EU funds from 2007 onwards, and achieving a voluntary EU burden-sharing agreement on illegal migration.

The first priority of Gonzi&#x27;s government was to move the country forward, reforming different sectors of the economy such as the restructuring of Air Malta, the Malta shipyards, the &quot;Gozo Channel&quot; shipping line, public transport and others. These became a priority following Malta&#x27;s accession to the EU, economic reform became crucial to the country&#x27;s development. Even if unpopular, Gonzi also pushed for a reform of the pension system, to guarantee its future sustainability. Despite the cost to his party and personal popularity, Lawrence Gonzi continued to push through these reforms, trying to ensure Malta took the best advantage of EU funding available to new member states.

===Financial crisis and 2008 re-election===
Gonzi was re-elected Prime Minister on 8 March 2008, in a deeply contested general election; he was the first prime minister in the euro area to be re-elected after introducing the euro. The Nationalist Party won this election with a majority of less than 1,200 votes, which translated in a one-seat majority. This proved to be the eventual undoing of the administration. In his first message to the nation at the beginning of this legislature, Gonzi said that the work of his government should be based on sustainable development, putting the environment on par with education and the economy. He relinquished his post as Minister of Finance in favour of Tonio Fenech, but assumed responsibility for the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA), in particular its reform.

Gonzi&#x27;s second government focused on crucial aspects of the Maltese economy, dealing with the repercussions of the financial crisis of 2007–2008. His cabinet initiated various projects, such as SmartCity Malta and an architectural showcase project by Renzo Piano in Valletta. Gonzi&#x27;s government provided financial aid and support to local industries, allowing investment to continue unimpeded and keeping unemployment low in the country. Guarantees were also provided to public-sector companies. In his response to the crisis, Gonzi&#x27;s macroeconomic focus rested on the creation of employment opportunities. His economic policies were hailed by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.

Throughout his administration as prime minister, the restructuring of the Maltese economy was accelerated; Malta became an attractive location for foreign direct investment in financial services, information technology, maritime and aviation hubs and high value-added manufacturing clusters.

=== Libya policy ===

The Libyan crisis was a major foreign policy challenge for Lawrence Gonzi and his government. The Prime Minister denounced the crimes against humanity being perpetrated by the Gaddafi regime at an early stage of the conflict, when the outcome was not yet clear. Throughout the crisis Malta served as a hub for the evacuation of foreign nationals from Libya. Gonzi provided humanitarian and medical assistance to Libya, granted asylum to two Libyan Air Force pilots who defected after being ordered to bomb protesters in Benghazi. Lawrence Gonzi refused to return the pilots’ jets to the Gaddafi regime, allowing NATO jets to implement a UN-sanctioned no-fly zone to land in Malta whenever necessary, exchanging intelligence on the Libyan conflict with NATO. Gonzi also offered valuable support to other European nations, negotiating the release of two Dutch pilots held captive by Gaddafi&#x27;s forces.

Lawrence Gonzi also made it clear, back in March 2011, that Gaddafi&#x27;s exit from Libya was &quot;inevitable&quot;, a message he reiterated in early April. Gonzi told the visiting Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdul-Ati al-Obeidi, that Gaddafi and his family &quot;must go&quot;, and the Libyan people&#x27;s wish for democracy should be respected. Malta&#x27;s support for the Libyan revolution was appreciated by the country&#x27;s new rulers, and the chairman of the Transitional National Council, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, made it clear that Malta was to have a &quot;distinguished role&quot; in the rebuilding of Libya.

=== Backbench rebellion and 2013 election ===
The weak, one seat majority of the second Gonzi administration was open to internal divisions and backbencher rebellions. These included the sabotage of plans to construct a museum beneath St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral in Valletta by Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, who then went on to vote against the government in a motion calling for the resignation of Malta&#x27;s permanent-representative to the EU, Richard Cachia Caruana. Jesmond Mugliett, a Nationalist MP, abstained on this motion citing concerns with Malta&#x27;s reactivation of its Partnership for Peace collaboration with NATO - something he believed was pushed by Cachia Caruana.

In another crisis, Franco Debono, the third rebel MP, abstained in a vote of confidence in Transport Minister Austin Gatt, and voted against the government in a no confidence vote on Home Affairs Minister, Carm Mifsud Bonnici. In early 2012, Lawrence Gonzi lost his majority when Pullicino Orlando declared himself to be an independent MP. The Nationalist Party executive condemned the three rebel MPs for their votes on the motions against Mifsud Bonnici and Cachia Caruana. However, Gonzi managed to keep his party in government right until a budget vote on 10 December 2012, when Franco Debono joined the Labour party Opposition, and voted against the budget. Debono&#x27;s reasons included his belief that the government had mismanaged major privatisation initiatives, as well as dozens of perceived slights to his person. This vote brought down the Nationalist government, with parliament dissolved on 7 January 2013. An election held in March resulted in a Labour victory, by a 35,107 vote margin.

Within half an hour of the start of the vote counting, Gonzi conceded defeat and held a press conference in which he expressed his desire to resign from the PN leadership. Gonzi shouldered &quot;total and complete responsibility&quot; for the electoral defeat, later admitting that mistakes were made &quot;in attitude, arrogance&quot; by his second cabinet. However he insisted that the results achieved by Malta, as an exception to the rest of the EU, were down to his cabinet&#x27;s performance in the midst of a backbench rebellion. His detractors criticised his lack of resolve in confronting the three dissident backbenchers, Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, Franco Debono and Jesmond Mugliett. Additionally, Gonzi&#x27;s principled unwillingness to vote in favour of the introduction of divorce in Parliament, following its approval by the electorate, proved unpopular. His conscientious vote against divorce, however, did not stop him from ensuring there were enough votes on both sides of the House for its ultimate approval.

Gonzi became Leader of the Opposition on 20 March 2013, resigning from this post on 13 May 2013. He was succeeded by Simon Busuttil. Lawrence Gonzi resigned from parliament on 17 July 2013, saying that his seat ought be occupied by someone &quot;who can give the electorate all his energy&quot;. Gonzi has since retired from active political life. However, he attends and has given guest lectures in a number of universities and various conferences. His recollections of the critical decisions leading up to Malta&#x27;s break with Gaddafi were published as a memoir in December 2013. Gonzi also led the Commonwealth Observer Group for the 2013 Maldivian presidential election.

<text>San Pablo Bay is a tidal estuary that forms the northern extension of the San Francisco Bay in the East Bay and North Bay regions of the San Francisco Bay Area in northern California.

Most of the Bay is shallow; however, there is a deep water channel approximately in the middle of the bay, which allows access to major ports in Sacramento, Stockton, Benicia, and Martinez; and other smaller ports on the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta.

==Geography==
San Pablo Bay was named after Rancho San Pablo, a Spanish land grant given to colonial Alta California settlers in 1815, on the bay at the site of the present-day city of San Pablo. The bay is approximately across and has an area of approximately .

The bay receives the waters of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, via Suisun Bay and the Carquinez Strait on its northeast end, and it connects to the Pacific Ocean via the San Francisco Bay on its southern end. The bay is heavily silted from the contributions of the two rivers, which themselves drain most of the Central Valley of California. San Pablo Bay also receives the waters of Sonoma Creek through the Napa Sonoma Marsh, San Rafael Creek, and the Petaluma River directly, and the Napa River which flows into the Carquinez Strait via the Mare Island Strait near its entrance into the bay. All tributaries except for Sonoma Creek are commercially navigable and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Two peninsulas separate San Pablo Bay from San Francisco Bay. The eastern, Point San Pablo, is in the city of Richmond and the western, Point San Pedro, borders the city of San Rafael. The bay is shared between Contra Costa county on the southern and eastern shore, and Solano, Sonoma and Marin counties on the northern and western shores. The county boundaries meet near the center of the bay. Communities on the shores of San Pablo Bay include: Richmond, San Pablo, Pinole, Hercules, Rodeo in Contra Costa County, Vallejo in Solano County, along with Novato and San Rafael in Marin County.

Because the Bay is close to several major and local airports, but outside of the main air traffic corridors, it is a popular pilot training area.

Because of its great size but shallow waters, San Pablo Bay frequently has difficult boating conditions. The prevailing western wind meets strong currents both at Carquinez Straits and, at the opposite end of the bay, near the Richmond Bridge, to produce large waves, with few areas of retreats for most boats.

==Ecology==
There are many undeveloped shore lands with salt marshes and mudflats. The Bay is a primary wintering stop for the canvasback duck population on the Pacific Flyway, as well as a migratory staging ground for numerous species of waterfowl. Much of the northern shore of the bay is protected as part of the San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge.

Endangered species that are found in the bay include the California brown pelican, California clapper rail, and salt marsh harvest mouse. This is a popular destination for recreation fishing, with Saltwater species including: striped bass, surfperch, sturgeon, starry flounder, leopard shark, topsmelt, and anchovy. In the 1880s there was a shrimp-fishing village, where some 500 Chinese people lived; they shipped approximately 90% of their catch to China. The location is now part of China Camp State Park.

==Popular culture==
San Pablo Bay is the setting of alternative rock band Primus&#x27;s four-part song series &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Chronicles,&quot; and is also referenced in &quot;The Toys Go Winding Down&quot; and &quot;Harold of the Rocks.&quot; It is also mentioned in The Minus 5 song &quot;John Barleycorn Must Live.&quot; In Susan Choi&#x27;s book, &quot;American Woman,&quot; which mirrors the Patty Hearst scandal of the 1970s, the Bay&#x27;s waters are said to welcome main characters Jenny and Pauline home after they&#x27;ve traversed from the East coast.

The park is the site of several national landmarks including the Korean War Veterans Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, George Mason Memorial, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial.

The park includes the surrounding land on the shore of the Tidal Basin, an artificial inlet of the Potomac River which was created in the 19th century, an inlet that links the Potomac with the northern end of the Washington Channel.

West Potomac Park is administered by National Mall and Memorial Parks, an administrative unit of the National Park Service&#x27;s National Capital Parks.

==Creation of the park==
Almost none of the National Mall west of the Washington Monument grounds and below Constitution Avenue NW existed prior to 1882. After terrible flooding inundated much of downtown Washington, D.C., in 1881, Congress ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge a deep channel in the Potomac and use the material to fill in the Potomac (creating the current banks of the river) and raise much of the land near the White House and along Pennsylvania Avenue NW by nearly . In the process, the nearby Babcock Lakes, a series of small ponds, were filled in. This &quot;reclaimed land&quot; — which included West Potomac Park, East Potomac Park, the Tidal Basin — was largely complete by 1890, and designated Potomac Park by Congress in 1897. Congress first appropriated money for the beautification of the reclaimed land in 1902, which led to the planting of sod, bushes, and trees; grading and paving of sidewalks, bridle paths, and driveways; and the installation of water, drainage, and sewage pipes.

==Cherry trees==
The famous sakura Japanese cherry trees of Washington, D.C., line the Tidal Basin and are the main attraction at the National Cherry Blossom Festival in early spring, when the cherry blossoms bloom. Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, upon returning to Washington, D.C., from a visit to Japan, initiated the idea of cherry trees in Washington, D.C., She approached the Superintendent of Public Building and Grounds, then Colonel Spencer Cosby, about the idea in 1885. Her idea was rejected; over the next 24 years, Scidmore approached every new superintendent, but the idea was never authorized. 

In 1906, Dr. David Fairchild, a botanist who worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, imported 75 flowering cherry trees and 25 single-flowered weeping types from the Yokohama Nursery Company in Japan. Fairchild planted these trees on a hillside on his own property in Chevy Chase, Maryland, testing their hardiness in the Washington area. In 1907, pleased with the success of the trees, Fairchild and his wife began to promote Japanese flowering cherry trees as the ideal type of tree to plant along avenues in the Washington area. Friends of family also became interested, and on September 26, arrangements were completed with the Chevy Chase Land Company to order 300 Oriental cherry trees for the Chevy Chase area.

In 1908, Fairchild gave cherry saplings to boys from each school in the District to plant in schoolyards on Arbor Day. In closing his Arbor Day speech, Fairchild expressed a vision that the &quot;Speedway&quot; (the present day corridor of Independence Avenue in West Potomac Park) be transformed into a Field of Cherries. In attendance was Eliza Scidmore, who afterwards he referred to as a great authority on Japan. In 1909, Scidmore decided to try to raise the money required to purchase the cherry trees and then donate the trees to the city. Scidmore sent a note outlining her new plan to the new First Lady, Helen Herron Taft—the wife of President William Howard Taft— who had once lived in Japan and was familiar with the beauty of the flowering cherry trees. Two days later, the First Lady responded: 
:&quot;The White House, Washington&quot;
:&quot;April 7, 1909&quot;
:&quot;Thank you very much for your suggestion about the cherry trees. I have taken the matter up and am promised the trees, but I thought perhaps it would be best to make an avenue of them, extending down to the turn in the road, as the other part (beyond the railroad bridge Ed.) is still too rough to do any planting. Of course, they could not reflect in the water, but the effect would be very lovely of the long avenue. Let me know what you think about this.&quot;
:&quot;Sincerely yours,&quot;
:&quot;Helen H. Taft&quot;

On April 8, the day after Taft&#x27;s letter, Dr. Jōkichi Takamine, the Japanese chemist famous as the discoverer of adrenaline and takadiastase, was in Washington, D.C., with Midzuno, the Japanese consul in New York City. When told Washington was to have Japanese cherry trees planted along the Speedway, he asked whether the First Lady would accept a donation of an additional 2,000 trees. Midzuno thought it was a fine idea and suggested the trees be given in the name of Tokyo, the capital of Japan. Takamine and Midzuno met with the Helen Taft, who accepted the offer.

On April 13, five days after the First Lady&#x27;s request, the Superintendent of Public Building and Grounds ordered the purchase of 90 cherry trees (&quot;Prunus serrulata&quot;) of the Fugenzo variety from Hoopes Brothers and Thomas Company in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The trees were planted along the Potomac River from the present site of the Lincoln Memorial south toward East Potomac Park. After planting, it was discovered that the trees were not correctly named, and were not of the Fugenzo variety, but instead of the Shirofugen cultivar (cultivated variety). These trees have since disappeared.

Four months later, on August 30, the Japanese embassy informed the U.S. Department of State that Tokyo intended to donate 2,000 cherry trees to the United States to be planted along the Potomac River. On December 10, the trees arrived in Seattle, and on January 6, 1910 arrived in the capital. However, an inspection team for the Department of Agriculture discovered to everyone&#x27;s dismay that the trees were infested with insects, roundworms, and plant diseases. To protect American growers, the department concluded that the trees must be destroyed. On January 28, Taft gave permission to destroy the trees, and they were burned. This diplomatic setback resulted in letters from Secretary of State and the representatives to the Japanese ambassador, expressing deep regret of all concerned. Dr. Takamine, meeting the bad news with goodwill, again donated the costs for the trees in 1912, whose number he now increased to 3,020. The seeds for these trees were taken in December 1910 from the famous collection on the bank of the Arakawa River in Adachi Ward, a suburb of Tokyo, and grafted on specially selected understock produced in Itami City in Hyōgo Prefecture.

The National Park Service cut 158 of the nearly 3,700 trees in 2024 to rebuild a seawall around the Tidal Basin to strengthen it to withstand sea level rise and more extreme rain events.

==Recreation==
The West Potomac Rugby Football Club&#x27;s match and practice pitch is located in the park.

<doc id="573337" wikidata="Q38047" url="?curid=573337" title="Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier">
<text>The soft-coated Wheaten Terrier ( - literally, &quot;Yellow Terrier&quot;) is a pure-breed terrier originating from Ireland. Wheatens typically have one of two coat types: Irish or Heavy (American). The Irish coat is generally silkier and wavier than the Heavy, or American coat, which is thicker and fuller. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is named for its silky, wheat-colored coat. Wheatens are generally friendly and playful, and tend to get along well with children and other dogs.

==History==
The Wheaten was bred in Ireland for over two hundred years to be an all-purpose farm dog whose duties included herding, watching and guarding livestock, and vermin hunting and killing. They share a common ancestry with the Kerry Blue Terrier and the Irish Terrier but were not owned by gentry. In Ireland, they were commonly referred to as the &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Wolfhound.&quot; The Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier received the nickname &quot;Poor Man’s Wolfhound&quot; because people in Ireland were prohibited from owning hunting dogs such as Irish Wolfhounds or Beagles. So, folks bred the Wheaten Terrier as a versatile farm and guard dog instead. Wheaten Terriers used to be docked to avoid taxes and were often kept to a specific size.

Despite its long history, the Wheaten was not recognized as a breed in Ireland by the Irish Kennel Club until 1937. In 1943, the British Kennel Club recognized the breed in the UK as well. The first Wheatens were exported to Lydia Vogel in the United States in the 1940s, but serious interest in the breed took another ten years to develop. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of America, Inc. was established in 1962, seven years after the formation of The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of Great Britain. In the 1970s, the first Wheatens were imported into Australia by Anubis Kennels. In 1973, they were recognized by the American Kennel Club. The recent importation of Irish-style dogs has improved and broadened the gene pool. The American Herding Breed Association (AHBA) accepted the Wheaten in the 1990s at which point members of the breed were allowed to participate in its herding capability tests and trials. Today, Wheatens compete in obedience, agility, and tracking and are occasionally used in animal-assisted therapy as well. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of America, Inc. (SCWTCA, Inc.) is a member of the American Kennel Club which protects and advances the interests of the breed and guards against commercial exploitation. It serves breeders, owners, competition organizers and prospective owners.

==Appearance==

Puppies have dark coats of red, brown, mahogany or white. Their muzzles and ears may be black or dark brown. The reddish-brown puppy coat gradually grows out to nearly white before maturing into a wheaten-colored coat as they get older. The adult coat typically matures by 3 years old and may contain black, white, or darker brown &quot;guard&quot; hairs in addition to the lighter wheaten colored hair. If adults ever have skin injuries, the resulting hair growth (wound hair) will be the dark color of their puppy coat before it eventually grows out to the wheat color. It may also come out to a molten chocolate color, either white or milky colored fur .

The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is a medium-sized dog, which ranges on average from in height and about in weight. The breed has a square structure and is well built. Their soft, silky hair does not shed like most dogs; like human hair and Poodle hair, it keeps growing; they do need trimming and should be brushed and combed once a day to avoid mats. They are very smart dogs, and are easy to train. They respond the best to praise and learning tricks can come very easily to them. They love people, and they rarely have aggression issues if obtained from a reputable breeder.

The Irish coat tends to be thinner and silkier than the American variety and it has a devoted following in Ireland and Europe. Breeders of the pure Irish type believe this is the original working coat. The coat is not thin – breeders of the Irish type consider the American heavy coat to be &quot;bouffant&quot;, not that of the original working terrier type. There are a few breeders of the Irish type in the US and Canada. In the AKC conformation show ring, the judges do not always accept the Irish type well. The Irish is well received in the UK and Europe. The &quot;Heavy Irish&quot; coat is usually a result of cross-breeding between coat types – American/English coat with an Irish type. The Irish coat still requires daily brushing to stay free of matted hair.

The Wheatens seen in Ireland today are of the same size, shape, and coat texture as those seen and documented well over 100 years ago. Evidence of this can be seen from the famous artwork &quot;The Aran Fisherman&#x27;s Drowned Child&quot; by the Irish painter Frederic William Burton.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.7 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Soft-coated Wheaten Terriers are generally a long-lived breed. They are susceptible to various heritable diseases, although are most known for two protein wasting conditions: protein-losing nephropathy (PLN), where the dogs lose protein via the kidneys; and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), where the dogs fail to fully absorb protein in their digestive tracts, causing it to pass in their stool. Both PLN and PLE are potentially fatal, but if caught early enough, can sometimes be managed with strict dietary changes and pharmaceuticals. Laboratory tests can aid in diagnosing PLN and PLE; Wheaten owners should check their country&#x27;s advised testing protocols. Research suggests that PLE and PLN often are more prevalent in female wheatens and often happen in concurrence, with PLE following diagnosis of PLN. While a genetic predisposition has been suggested, an unknown mode of inheritance remains. Research programs, mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, are looking for answers.

Other Wheaten health issues are renal dysplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, Addison&#x27;s disease, and cancer. Some Wheatens can suffer from food and environmental allergies, and can be prone to developing the skin disease atopic dermatitis. Potential owners of Wheaten Terriers should discuss health issues with a breeder before deciding to get a puppy.

==Temperament==
The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is an energetic and playful dog. It requires patience and consistent positive training. Harsh methods will often result in fear and/or aggression. A positive, even-handed approach works best with this intelligent yet headstrong terrier. It is an enthusiastic greeter, and will often jump up to lick a person&#x27;s face, commonly referred to as the &quot;Wheaten greetin&quot;. Wheatens are considered less scrappy than other terriers, but are lively and can be more active than many other breeds. For this reason these dogs do best when they are exercised regularly.

They are cool-weather dogs and can become easily overheated in hot weather. If socialised with cats and puppies, they may get along fine with them; if not, care should be taken in introducing them to cats, as the breed has a very strong &quot;prey drive&quot; because of its vermin-hunting origin. Wheatens are friendly and loving pets, and get along well with other dogs if properly socialised. Wheatens are very protective of their families and, although they may bark in alert at strangers, they rarely become aggressive. If not properly trained they can bark excessively. Many Wheaten owners thus say they make great watch dogs, but poor guard dogs. Wheatens are a great dog for children and are generally friendly towards them. Wheatens are very curious and will most likely try to wander if left outside alone. If well trained they can become very loyal and will listen very well to commands.

<text>Schweinfurt ( , ; ) is a city in the district of Lower Franconia in Bavaria, Germany. It is the administrative centre of the surrounding district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) of Schweinfurt and a major industrial, cultural and educational hub. The urban agglomeration has 100,200 (2018) and the city&#x27;s catchment area, including the Main-Rhön region and parts of South Thuringia, 759,000 inhabitants.

Schweinfurt was first documented in 791 and is one of the oldest cities in Bavaria. Around 1000 the Margraves of Schweinfurt controlled large parts of northern Bavaria. From the 12th century until 1802 Schweinfurt was a Free imperial city within the Holy Roman Empire, around 1700 a humanistic centre and in 1770 began the 250-year industrial history.

During World War II, the Americans suffered their biggest air defeat over Schweinfurt in the Second Raid on Schweinfurt &quot;(Black Thursday)&quot;. On 11 April 1945, the US Army invaded the city. During the Cold War, the 1945 founded USAG Schweinfurt had the highest concentration of US combat units in the Federal Republic of Germany. In the northwest of Schweinfurt, an American town emerged, with a complete civil infrastructure including all kinds of shops for 12,000 Americans, soldiers and civilians. Until the withdrawal of the US Army at Schweinfurt in 2014, a total of about 100,000 US soldiers were stationed in the town.

Following German Reunification in 1990, Schweinfurt has become an important traffic hub in the centre of Germany. It has the highest employment density (2015) and the third highest gross domestic product per inhabitant of Germany (2014). The world&#x27;s largest bearing group SKF, the second largest Schaeffler, the second largest automotive supplier in the world ZF Friedrichshafen and the DAX group Fresenius Medical Care have their largest plants in Schweinfurt.

Some important inventions have their origin in Schweinfurt: the pedal bike by Philipp Moritz Fischer (1853) as well as the freewheel (1889) and the coaster brake (1903) by Ernst Sachs. In 1652, the oldest permanently existing natural-scientific academy in the world was founded in Schweinfurt, the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

==History==
===Pre-BCE History===
Traces of settlement as early as 7500 years ago can be detected on today&#x27;s urban area at various places. The first settlement of the historic Schweinfurt &quot;(Village Old Town)&quot; was also on the Main, between the two streams &quot;Höllenbach&quot; and &quot;Marienbach&quot;, 1 km east of the later founded imperial city, which corresponds to the old town today. The &quot;Village Old Town&quot; is in its origins at least 2100 years old.

===8th–13th centuries===
The first documentary mention Schweinfurts (village old town) took place in the year 791. Schweinfurt gained importance in 941 with the mention of Count Berthold as the first member of the House of the Counts of Schweinfurt. He occupied an important position in the central Reich territory, the Duchy of Franconia. Berthold gave the king of East Francia Otto I. (936–973), who in 962 became Roman-German Emperor, valuable weapons aid against rebellious tribal dukes. As thanks Berthold of Otto I received the counties for the Folkfeld- and the Radenzgau and the Margraviate for the Nordgau, about the present-day Upper Palatinate. Thus he was and from 980 his son Henry the most powerful secular nobility in the area of today&#x27;s northern Bavaria.

Later supported Count Henry of Schweinfurt (called: &quot;Hezilo&quot;) the East Frankish Henry II (1002–1024, from 1014 Roman-German Emperor) in the royal election of 1002 and was awarded the Duke dignity of Bavarians. After the election, however, Henry II did not fulfill the promise. Thereupon it came to the &quot;Schweinfurt Feud&quot; in 1003. Count Heinrich lost all his possessions. The confiscated royal goods formed the core of the new bishopric of Bamberg. Hezilo, however, retained his possessions around the castle hill &quot;Peterstirn&quot;. The family, in which Judith of Schweinfurt became a central figure in the history of the old Schweinfurt city, died in the male line of 1057 and at the latest this year marks the undisputed end of the important role of the Margraves of Schweinfurt.

To the beginnings of today&#x27;s old town from the 12th century, 1 km west of the previous settlement between the two streams &quot;Marienbach&quot; and &quot;Höllenbach&quot;, there are different views. The from a gradual construction to a planned Civitas Imperii (imperial city), so a founding city, by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, using existing royal estate, rich. In the struggle for supremacy in &quot;Main Franconia&quot; (region around the river Main) between the Henneberger and the Bishop of Würzburg, the city was destroyed between 1240 and 1250 &quot;(First City Spoilage)&quot;. However, it is controversial whether this destruction was still in the old settlement between Höllenbach and Marienbach and thus a reason for the rebuilding of the city on the farther west, today&#x27;s site was or whether the destruction took place here already. In a letter from King William of Holland dated January 9, 1254, it is said that Schweinfurt used to be imperial city &quot;(... Swinforde, que olim imperii civitas fuerat)&quot;. It remains unclear whether rights have ever been withdrawn from the city or whether only reference is made to the city&#x27;s destruction. However, this letter is the first documentary evidence of Schweinfurt as imperial city and thus as a place with city rights.

===13th–15th centuries===
The (inner) city fortification of the new city was built and first documented in 1258, it is still largely preserved on Marienbach today. A document from 1282 signed by Rudolf I of Habsburg states that Schweinfurt was a free city within the Holy Roman Empire. By pledge 1309 Schweinfurt came to the House of Henneberg, who maintained from 1310 to 1427 a &quot;Reichsburg&quot; (castle of the empire) in the old Schweinfurt city district &quot;Zürch&quot;.

In the 15th century began the construction of a territory around the core city, which lasted until 1620. In 1436, the fishermen&#x27;s settlement of &quot;Fischerrain&quot;, which borders on the city wall and lies just to the southwest, whose origins lie in the darkness of history, was incorporated into the city. Due to positive economic development, the city can acquire the suburb of Oberndorf in 1436. 1436/37 received the advice of the city from the Teutonic Knights for 18,000 guilders the castle on the &quot;Peterstirn&quot; and the associated land area with the villages Zell and Weipoltshausen, which belongs to Üchtelhausen today.

===16th–18th centuries===
Schweinfurt joined the Reformation relatively late, in 1542 since the city, together with neighboring imperial villages and imperial villages, was completely surrounded by the Catholic Hochstift Würzburg. In a confession change had to be expected military assault. The patron of the city, Count Wilhelm von Henneberg, did not offer sufficient support.

In the course of the Second Margrave War, the city was looted in 1554 and set on fire. This went as the &quot;Second City Spoilage&quot; in the city history (&quot;First City Spoilage&quot; see: 8th–13th centuries). The reconstruction dragged on until 1615. In this form, the old town, with the exception of later modernized fortifications, remained almost unchanged until the early 19th century. In 1609 the city joined the Protestant Union. The imperial city territory was supplemented 1620 also still around Madenhausen, which also belongs to Üchtelhausen today. Due to the acquisitions, the territory of the imperial city now had an extension of 17 km from southwest to northeast. As a result of the city of Schweinfurt on the knight canton of Baunach a nearly continuous Protestant corridor was created by the Hochstifte Würzburg and Bamberg in the Protestant Duchy of Saxony.

Schweinfurt joined the Protestant Union in 1609. In the Thirty Years&#x27; War it was occupied by Gustavus Adolphus, who erected fortifications, the remains of which are still extant. In 1652 the four doctors Johann Laurentius Bausch, Johann Michael Fehr, Georg Balthasar Wolfahrt and Balthasar Metzger founded the &quot;Academia Curiosorum&quot; in Schweinfurt, which is known today as the German Academy of Life Scientists, &quot;Leopoldina&quot;.

Schweinfurt remained a free imperial city until 1802, when it passed to the Electorate of Bavaria. Assigned to the grand duke of Würzburg in 1810, it was granted to the Kingdom of Bavaria four years later. The first railway junction was opened in 1852. In the following years Schweinfurt became a world leading centre for the production of ball bearings. This was to lead to grievous consequences for the city during World War II.

===18th–20th centuries===
The year 1770 marked the beginning of the industrialization of the city, with its 250-year-old industrial history. In the first century of industrialization, the chemical and paint industry started in Schweinfurt, with the construction of the Wolf&#x27;s lead white mill at the Bleiweißmühlenwehr. According to Dr. Ferdinand Gademann (1880–1969), it was the oldest German lead white factory. In 1780 the factory was taken over by Johann Martin Schmidt. Further factory-similar plants of this kind originated at the Bellevue and in the neighboring suburb Niederwerrn.

Following the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, Schweinfurt came to Bavaria in 1803, two years before the Kingdom of Bavaria was founded. 4000 people demonstrated against the Anschluss at the Rossmarkt. After the interim membership of the Grand Duchy of Würzburg (1810–1814), Schweinfurt fell in 1814 to the Kingdom of Bavaria. The villages belonging to the imperial city territory were spun off. As a result, Schweinfurt lost about two-thirds of its territory.

1852 took place with the opening of the &quot;Ludwigs-Westbahn&quot; from Bamberg to the new Schweinfurt Stadt station the connection to the railway network. With the construction of the line to Bad Kissingen (1871) and the Schweinfurt–Meiningen railway (1874) Schweinfurt became a railway junction. In 1874, a large marshalling and central station was built 3 km west of the city station, at that time on Oberndorf district, the so-called &quot;Central Station&quot; and today&#x27;s Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof at the Bamberg–Rottendorf railway. It was created in a far-sighted manner amidst fields as a passenger and goods main station, with the aim of leaving as much room for the expected industrialization of the station, which also took place here until the end of the 1930s was. The Schweinfurt tram was the first municipal tram in Bavaria from 1895 to 1921 to connect the Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof with the city centre.

Unlike many other cities, the 1930s were one of the most important epochs of urban development in Schweinfurt. The number of employees of major metalworking companies rose to 20,700 by 1939. This led to a construction boom and set the course for modern urban development.

===World War II===


In 1939, Schweinfurt produced most of Nazi Germany&#x27;s ball bearings, and factories such as the Schweinfurter Kugellagerwerke became a target of Allied strategic bombing during World War II to cripple tank and aircraft production. Schweinfurt was bombed 22 times during Operation Pointblank by a total of 2,285 aircraft.

The Schweinfurt–Regensburg mission caused an immediate 34% loss of production and all plants but the largest were devastated by fire. Efforts to disperse the surviving machinery began immediately and the Luftwaffe deployed large numbers of interceptors along the corridor to Schweinfurt. Bombing also included the Second Raid on Schweinfurt on 14 October 1943 (&quot;called Black Thursday because of the enormous loss of aircraft (60) and lives (600+)&quot;) and Big Week in February 1944. 

Although losses of production bearings and machinery were high and much of the industrial and residential areas of the city were destroyed, killing more than a thousand civilians, the factories were restored to production and the industry dispersed. Although German planners initially thought it essential to purchase the entire output of the Swedish ball-bearing industry, losses in the production of bearings were actually made up from surpluses found within Germany in the aftermath of the first raid. The decentralized industry was able to restore output to 85% of its pre-bombing level. Hitler made restoration of ball bearing production a high priority and massive efforts were undertaken to repair and rebuild the factories, partly in bomb-proof underground facilities.

The 42nd Infantry Division (United States) entered Schweinfurt on 11 April 1945 and engaged in house-to-house fighting. On 12 April an internment camp at Goethe-Schule held male civilians aged 16–60.

===U.S. Army Garrison Schweinfurt===


After the war Schweinfurt became a stronghold of the U.S. military and their dependents. Thus Schweinfurt recovered relatively quickly from its third period of destruction. The tank barracks renamed Ledward Barracks in 1946, became the headquarters of the newly founded U.S. Army Garrison Schweinfurt (USAG Schweinfurt). The U.S. Army took over the Luftwaffe Airfield as Schweinfurt Army Heliport and renamed the air base to &quot;Conn Barracks&quot;. In the course of time, until 2014, they were expanded into large barracks with many hangars, administration buildings, a large event hall, church and sports facilities.

From the 1950s to the late 1990s, a civilian infrastructure similar to that of a small American town was successively built in the northwest of Schweinfurt. As a result of the closure of many other German U.S. sites, Schweinfurt eventually became one of Europe&#x27;s largest U.S. locations. Including the &quot;Brönnhof&quot; training area the USAG Schweinfurt covered a total area of 29 km2. Schweinfurt formerly hosted the U.S. Army Garrison Schweinfurt, which the U.S. Army closed on 19 September 2014 due to an ongoing effort to concentrate the U.S. military&#x27;s footprint in Germany to fewer communities.

===Reconstruction and postwar period===
A quick, scheduled rebuilding of the city was not necessary due to the degree of destruction of 40 to 45% (see: Cityscape). Like many other West German cities and communities, Schweinfurt also experienced an unprecedented economic miracle in the 1950s and 1960s, and large-scale industry boomed. To counteract the labor shortage, guest workers were recruited from 1960 onwards.

Most of the postwar construction projects were realized under the aegis of Mayor Georg Wichtermann (SPD, 1965–1974), in the city governed by the SPD by an absolute majority. Numerous new residential districts were created. By the &quot;Jump over the River Main&quot; (starting from 1963) developed south of the Main River the commercial park &quot;Port East&quot; and the new industrial area &quot;Port West&quot;. The infrastructure was expanded, with the Main Port (1963) and today&#x27;s University of Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt (1971).

After successful reconstruction and the boom years, the time of Mayor Kurt Petzold (SPD, 1974–1992) was marked by consolidation, but also by the oil crisis and recessions, with job cuts in the local large-scale industry. The old town renovation began in 1979, as the starting point of a 40-year-long transformation of the city that has continued to this day, with a change in image, from the gray mouse industrial city to a city with a high quality of life. In 1991, the large &quot;Leopoldina Hospital&quot; was opened.

===The era Grieser 1992–2010===
In the city dominated by the SPD, the CSU succeeded in 1992 for the first time to make the Lord Mayor, with the political cross-starter Gudrun Grieser. The Bavarian state government under the then Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber (CSU) sympathetically accompanied the historical change of power and parts of the Bavarian State Social Court and the Bavarian State Statistics Office were relocated from Munich to Schweinfurt. During Grieser&#x27;s term of office, the economic situation stabilized starting in the mid-1990s, with 4,500 new industrial jobs and around 6,000 jobs in the service sector. Trade tax revenue rose to a record high.

In the Grieser era, the city&#x27;s new motto, &quot;Industry and Art&quot;, was developed. A large number of projects, in cooperation with the construction officer Jochen Müller (SPD) gave the city a new face, set new, nationally recognized symbols in architecture and were honored with numerous architecture prizes. Among the many realized projects are the new Industrial Park &quot;Gewerbepark Maintal&quot; (since 1995), the Museum Georg Schäfer (2000), the &quot;Maininsel Conference Center&quot; (2004), the &quot;Stadtbücherei Ebracher Hof&quot; (2007), the Kunsthalle Schweinfurt (art gallery, 2009), the Stadtgalerie Schweinfurt, a 300 m long shopping mall 2009) with redesign of the Weststadt (westend) and the new Schweinfurt Mitte station, the Youth Hostel (2009), the &quot;Health Park Schweinfurt&quot; (2009) and the Campus 2 of the University of Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt. The era of Grieser remains to this day shaping the city, like no other epoch after the reconstruction and it changed the city&#x27;s image lasting positive.

In 1998, German and American veterans and survivors of the bombing raids came together to erect a war memorial to the fallen. 2004 startet the Unterfrankenshuttle &quot;(Lower Franconia Shuttle)&quot; of the Erfurter Bahn (EB) regional railway with lines from Schweinfurt to other parts of Lower Franconia and to South Thuringia.

===Present===
The &quot;New Hadergasse Project&quot; was implemented under the current mayor Sebastian Remelé (CSU, since 2010). Trade tax receipts continued to rise and the city was able to save reserves. These are currently being used for the mammoth U.S. conversion project, which is currently one of the five largest military conversion projects in Germany. The i-Campus Schweinfurt in the former Ledward Barracks and the new district of Bellevue in the former Askren Manor Housing Area deserve special mention.

==Geography==
===Location===
Schweinfurt has a central location in Germany and is located about 40 km from Baden-Württemberg, Hesse and Thuringia, in the middle of Main Franconia, Germanic-speaking Europe and the European Union. Schweinfurt lies on the river Main, which connects the North Sea with the Black Sea via the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal. While not being part of any metropolitan area, the city is situated between the cities of Frankfurt (110 km west) and Nuremberg (90 km southeast), both with international airports.

Schweinfurt also has a natural location in the Franconian wine country, at the &quot;Schweinfurter Rhön&quot;, with the National Natural Heritage &quot;Brönnhof&quot; and is surrounded by Haßberge Hills, Steigerwald, Rhön and Spessart, with several natural parks and a biosphere reserve. In sight are Steigerwald, &quot;Gramschatzer Forest&quot; and Rhön. The city is located in a climatically contrasting region, between the summer hot &quot;Mainfränkischen Plates&quot; in the south and the low mountain range in the north, with international winter sports in Oberhof.

Schweinfurt itself is also a city of great contrasts, in terms of topography, use and population structure. The bourgeois east lies on the foothills of the &quot;Schweinfurter Rhön&quot;, is intersected by valleys with streams, with the above the &quot;Marienbach&quot; located old town and numerous detached houses, on the edge with vineyards and the city forest. The west, with the city centre, main station and (former) working-class neighborhoods, has a high proportion of migrants. The almost uninhabited south is the largest contiguous industrial area in Bavaria.

===New centrality===
As a result of the fall of the Iron Curtain, the economic and geographical situation of Schweinfurt changed fundamentally. In 2005, the Thuringian Forest Autobahn 71 Erfurt-Schweinfurt was completed as a transport &quot;Project German Unity&quot; No. 16. In 2017 Schweinfurt gained further centrality with the 10 billion Euro transport &quot;Project German Unity&quot; No. 8. Berlin is now under three and a half hours, Munich from 2:33 hours and Hamburg from 3:57 hours reachable, now two high-speed lines, with change in Bamberg and Würzburg. Berlin and Munich are about three-quarters of an hour faster from Schweinfurt than from Frankfurt. Paris is in 6:22 hours reachable. As part of the &quot;Deutsche Bahn Long-Distance Transport Offensive&quot; Schweinfurt receives no later than December 2028 a direct &quot;Inter City&quot; (IC) connection, through the new IC Bamberg-Stuttgart-Tübingen.

===Viticulture===
Viticulture has probably been practiced in the city for well over 1000 years. At the beginning of the 19th century, Schweinfurt was an important Franconian wine-growing and wine-trading town. At the end of the imperial city period in 1802 there were around 320 hectares of vines, which corresponds to today&#x27;s largest Franconian wine-growing town in Nordheim am Main. Large parts of today&#x27;s district, right up to the edge of the old town, are located on former vineyards. Goethe appreciated the Schweinfurt wine and had large quantities delivered. Today, with only 3.54 hectares of vineyards (2017), the local viticulture has hardly any economic, but still cultural importance for the self-awareness and way of life of the city.

The phylloxera appeared in Franconia in 1902 and hit the Schweinfurt area particularly hard. Since the 1980s, viticulture with the leading variety Silvaner has been carried out as planned in the historic wine locations of &quot;Peterstirn&quot; and &quot;Mainleite&quot;. Due to the almost complete interruption of winegrowing, the vineyards were spared the major land consolidation of the 1970s, during which the historical structures were mostly destroyed. The small wine-cultural landscape at Peterstirn Palace remained intact. There is a family-owned winery on Peterstirn, where a wine festival takes place twice a year.

===Districts===
In the Bavarian territorial reform no suburbs were incorporated into the city of Schweinfurt, which is why the urban area includes only the core city and incorporated in 1919 Oberndorf. The urban area was divided into 23 statistical districts, which are summarized in 15 districts (bold font in the table). For a long time, the Bergl was the most populous district, with 13,000 inhabitants around 1970. With only 9,163 inhabitants at the end of 2017, it was only second, after the city centre, with 11,276 inhabitants.

==Demographics==
In 1939, Schweinfurt had about 49,000 inhabitants. The population reached its highest level in 1970 with 58,500 inhabitants. While thereafter most German cities could compensate for a demographic-related decrease of inhabitants by incorporations, in Schweinfurt the population decreased to about 52,000 in 1987. By 1996, the population rose to 56,000, mainly due to the influx of late repatriates. However, by 2014, the number of inhabitants fell again to 51,600 people, the lowest since the early 1950s. Thereafter, contrary to the forecasts of the Bavarian State Statistics Office and the Bertelsmann Foundation, both of which merely continued the past demographic development, a positive turnaround occurred due to several factors not taken into account: refugees, US conversion, i-Campus Schweinfurt. Since 2015, the number of inhabitants has been rising steadily, most recently to 54,032 at the end of 2018.
Not included in the population statistics are members of the U.S. Army Garrison Schweinfurt stationed in and near the city between 1945 and 2014 with their families. These were at times over 12,000 people.

The urban agglomeration is in the case of Schweinfurt a better comparison size to the population of other cities. In 1994, it had 105,000 inhabitants, fell to 96,600 inhabitants (Census 9. 5. 2011) and then rose again to 100,200 inhabitants (estimate 31. 12. 2018).

==Economy==
Schweinfurt is known for its metal industry, especially ball bearing plants, FAG Kugelfischer AG, ZF Sachs AG, Bosch Rexroth and SKF. The pigment Schweinfurt Green is manufactured here. SRAM Corporation hosts the world&#x27;s largest development centre of the bicycle industry in Schweinfurt.

With a GDP per capita of €78,382, Schweinfurt ranks third in Germany after Wolfsburg and Frankfurt am Main.

According to a recent study by the Swiss Institute of Economic Research forecasters, Schweinfurt is one of the fastest-growing cities in Germany. The study confirmed the city, among other things, the highest concentration of jobs in Germany, with particularly high Beschäftigungsanteil (employment share) in the German high-tech sector.

The Contor-2010 study, which was commissioned by the &quot;Manager Magazine&quot;, ranked Schweinfurt as one of the most dynamic cities in Europe in terms of development opportunities. From rank 63 in 2007, the city significantly improved to rank 16 in 2010.

<text>Refractory metals are a class of metals that are extraordinarily resistant to heat and wear. The expression is mostly used in the context of materials science, metallurgy and engineering. The definition of which elements belong to this group differs. The most common definition includes five elements: two of the fifth period (niobium and molybdenum) and three of the sixth period (tantalum, tungsten, and rhenium). They all share some properties, including a melting point above 2000 °C and high hardness at room temperature. They are chemically inert and have a relatively high density. Their high melting points make powder metallurgy the method of choice for fabricating components from these metals. Some of their applications include tools to work metals at high temperatures, wire filaments, casting molds, and chemical reaction vessels in corrosive environments. Partly due to the high melting point, refractory metals are stable against creep deformation to very high temperatures.

==Definition==
Most definitions of the term &#x27;refractory metals&#x27; list the extraordinarily high melting point as a key requirement for inclusion. By one definition, a melting point above is necessary to qualify, which includes iridium, osmium, niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium and hafnium. The five elements niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten and rhenium are included in all definitions, while the widest definition, including all elements with a melting point above , such as titanium, vanadium, zirconium, and chromium. Technetium is not included because of its radioactivity, though it would otherwise have qualified under the widest definition.

==Properties==

===Physical===


Refractory metals have high melting points, with tungsten and rhenium the highest of all elements, and the other&#x27;s melting points only exceeded by osmium and iridium, and the sublimation of carbon. These high melting points define most of their applications. All the metals are body-centered cubic except rhenium which is hexagonal close-packed. The physical properties of the refractory elements vary significantly because they are members of different groups of the periodic table. The hardness, high melting and boiling points, and high enthalpies of atomization of these metals arise from the partial occupation of the outer d subshell, allowing the d electrons to participate in metallic bonding. This gives stiff, highly stable bonds to neighboring atoms and a body-centered cubic crystal structure that resists deformation. Moving to the right in the periodic table, more d electrons increase this effect, but as the d subshell fills they are pulled by the higher nuclear charge into the atom&#x27;s inert core, reducing their ability to delocalize to form bonds with neighbors. These opposing effects result in groups 5 through 7 exhibiting the most refractory properties.

Creep resistance is a key property of the refractory metals. In metals, the starting of creep correlates with the melting point of the material; the creep in aluminium alloys starts at 200 °C, while for refractory metals temperatures above 1500 °C are necessary. This resistance against deformation at high temperatures makes the refractory metals suitable against strong forces at high temperature, for example in jet engines, or tools used during forging.

===Chemical===
The refractory metals show a wide variety of chemical properties because they are members of three distinct groups in the periodic table. They are easily oxidized, but this reaction is slowed down in the bulk metal by the formation of stable oxide layers on the surface (passivation). Especially the oxide of rhenium is more volatile than the metal, and therefore at high temperature the stabilization against the attack of oxygen is lost, because the oxide layer evaporates. They all are relatively stable against acids.

==Applications==

Refractory metals, and alloys made from them, are used in lighting, tools, lubricants, nuclear reaction control rods, as catalysts, and for their chemical or electrical properties. Because of their high melting point, refractory metal components are never fabricated by casting. The process of powder metallurgy is used. Powders of the pure metal are compacted, heated using electric current, and further fabricated by cold working with annealing steps. Refractory metals and their alloys can be worked into wire, ingots, rebars, sheets or foil.

===Molybdenum alloys===

Molybdenum-based alloys are widely used, because they are cheaper than superior tungsten alloys. The most widely used alloy of molybdenum is the Titanium-Zirconium-Molybdenum alloy TZM, composed of 0.5% titanium and 0.08% of zirconium (with molybdenum being the rest). The alloy exhibits a higher creep resistance and strength at high temperatures, making service temperatures of above 1060 °C possible for the material. The high resistivity of Mo-30W, an alloy of 70% molybdenum and 30% tungsten, against the attack of molten zinc makes it the ideal material for casting zinc. It is also used to construct valves for molten zinc.

Molybdenum is used in mercury wetted reed relays, because molybdenum does not form amalgams and is therefore resistant to corrosion by liquid mercury.

Molybdenum is the most commonly used of the refractory metals. Its most important use is as a strengthening alloy of steel. Structural tubing and piping often contains molybdenum, as do many stainless steels. Its strength at high temperatures, resistance to wear and low coefficient of friction are all properties which make it invaluable as an alloying compound. Its excellent anti-friction properties lead to its incorporation in greases and oils where reliability and performance are critical. Automotive constant-velocity joints use grease containing molybdenum. The compound sticks readily to metal and forms a very hard, friction-resistant coating. Most of the world&#x27;s molybdenum ore can be found in China, the USA, Chile and Canada.

===Tungsten and its alloys===

Tungsten was discovered in 1781 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Tungsten has the highest melting point of all metals, at .

Up to 22% Rhenium is alloyed with tungsten to improve its high temperature strength and corrosion resistance. Thorium as an alloying compound is used when electric arcs have to be established. The ignition is easier and the arc burns more stably than without the addition of thorium. For powder metallurgy applications, binders have to be used for the sintering process. For the production of the tungsten heavy alloy, binder mixtures of nickel and iron or nickel and copper are widely used. The tungsten content of the alloy is normally above 90%. The diffusion of the binder elements into the tungsten grains is low even at the sintering temperatures and therefore the interior of the grains are pure tungsten.

Tungsten and its alloys are often used in applications where high temperatures are present but still a high strength is necessary and the high density is not troublesome. Tungsten wire filaments provide the vast majority of household incandescent lighting, but are also common in industrial lighting as electrodes in arc lamps. Lamps get more efficient in the conversion of electric energy to light with higher temperatures and therefore a high melting point is essential for the application as filament in incandescent light. Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW, also known as tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding) equipment uses a permanent, non-melting electrode. The high melting point and the wear resistance against the electric arc makes tungsten a suitable material for the electrode.

Tungsten&#x27;s high density and strength are also key properties for its use in weapon projectiles, for example as an alternative to depleted Uranium for tank gun rounds. Its high melting point makes tungsten a good material for applications like rocket nozzles, for example in the UGM-27 Polaris. Some of the applications of tungsten are not related to its refractory properties but simply to its density. For example, it is used in balance weights for planes and helicopters or for heads of golf clubs. In this applications similar dense materials like the more expensive osmium can also be used.

The most common use for tungsten is as the compound tungsten carbide in drill bits, machining and cutting tools. The largest reserves of tungsten are in China, with deposits in Korea, Bolivia, Australia, and other countries.

It also finds itself serving as a lubricant, antioxidant, in nozzles and bushings, as a protective coating and in many other ways. Tungsten can be found in printing inks, x-ray screens, in the processing of petroleum products, and flame proofing of textiles.

===Niobium alloys===
Niobium is nearly always found together with tantalum, and was named after Niobe, the daughter of the mythical Greek king Tantalus for whom tantalum was named. Niobium has many uses, some of which it shares with other refractory metals. It is unique in that it can be worked through annealing to achieve a wide range of strength and ductility, and is the least dense of the refractory metals. It can also be found in electrolytic capacitors and in the most practical superconducting alloys. Niobium can be found in aircraft gas turbines, vacuum tubes and nuclear reactors.

An alloy used for liquid rocket thruster nozzles, such as in the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103, which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium. Another niobium alloy was used for the nozzle of the Apollo Service Module. As niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400 °C, a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.

===Tantalum and its alloys===

Tantalum is one of the most corrosion-resistant substances available.

Many important uses have been found for tantalum owing to this property, particularly in the medical and surgical fields, and also in harsh acidic environments. It is also used to make superior electrolytic capacitors. Tantalum films provide the second most capacitance per volume of any substance after Aerogel, and allow miniaturization of electronic components and circuitry. Many cellular phones and computers contain tantalum capacitors.

===Rhenium alloys===

Rhenium is the most recently discovered refractory metal. It is found in low concentrations with many other metals, in the ores of other refractory metals, platinum or copper ores. It is useful as an alloy to other refractory metals, where it adds ductility and tensile strength. Rhenium alloys are being used in electronic components, gyroscopes and nuclear reactors. Rhenium finds its most important use as a catalyst. It is used as a catalyst in reactions such as alkylation, dealkylation, hydrogenation and oxidation. However its rarity makes it the most expensive of the refractory metals.

==Advantages and shortfalls==
The strength and high-temperature stability of refractory metals make them suitable for hot metalworking applications and for vacuum furnace technology. Many special applications exploit these properties: for example, tungsten lamp filaments operate at temperatures up to 3073 K, and molybdenum furnace windings withstand 2273 K.

However, poor low-temperature fabricability and extreme oxidability at high temperatures are shortcomings of most refractory metals. Interactions with the environment can significantly influence their high-temperature creep strength. Application of these metals requires a protective atmosphere or coating.

The refractory metal alloys of molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten have been applied to space nuclear power systems. These systems were designed to operate at temperatures from 1350 K to approximately 1900 K. An environment must not interact with the material in question. Liquid alkali metals as the heat transfer fluids are used as well as the ultra-high vacuum.

The high-temperature creep strain of alloys must be limited for them to be used. The creep strain should not exceed 1–2%. An additional complication in studying creep behavior of the refractory metals is interactions with environment, which can significantly influence the creep behavior.

<text>George Wither (11 June 1588 O.S. – 2 May 1667 O.S. ) was a prolific English poet, pamphleteer, satirist and writer of hymns. Wither&#x27;s long life spanned one of the most tumultuous periods in the history of England, during the reigns of Elizabeth I, James I, and Charles I, the Civil War, the Parliamentary period and the Restoration period.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Wither was born in Bentworth, near Alton, in the heart of Hampshire, the son of George Wither Senior of that place and his wife, Mary, who was possibly from the family of Hunt. His grandfather, Richard Wither, lived at Manydown in Wootton St Lawrence, where the family had resided since at least 1344. His early schooling took place under Rev. John Greaves, the father of John, Sir Edward and Thomas Greaves. Between the ages of fifteen and seventeen he studied at Magdalen College, Oxford. Despite his neighbours&#x27; advice that his father put him to some mechanic trade, he was sent to one of the Inns of Chancery, eventually obtaining an introduction at Court.

It is thought that he spent some time in Ireland, perhaps with Adam Loftus at Rathfarnham Castle. He wrote what amounted to a masque for a wedding that took place there in 1610, of the parents of Francis Willughby.

He wrote an elegy (1612) on the death of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, and a volume of gratulatory poems (1613) on the marriage of the princess Elizabeth.

===Imprisonment and release===

Some time between 1611 and 1613 he wrote &quot;Abuses Stript and Whipt&quot;, twenty satires directed against Revenge, Ambition, Lust. These satires—aimed at exposing &quot;th&#x27;abuses of these wicked Times&quot;—achieved some popular success and there were seven printings from 1613 to 1617. The volume included a poem called &quot;The Scourge&quot;, in which the Lord Chancellor was attacked, and a series of epigrams. Despite the fact that the satires referenced nobody by name, and that Wither had published them a year before with no trouble, he was arrested for libel &quot;on or about 20 March 1614&quot; and held in the Marshalsea prison for four months before being released.

In &quot;A Satyre: Dedicated to His Most Excellent Majestie&quot;, Wither made a bold appeal to King James for his release, claiming that he had &quot;not sought to scandalize the state, nor sowne sedition.&quot; The cause for his initial imprisonment is somewhat unclear, as the &quot;Abuses&quot; were in fact very general, and had not satirized any one person by name.

Charles Lamb commented

that a man should be convicted of libel when he named no names but Hate, and Envy, and Lust, and Avarice, is like one of the indictments in the &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, where Faithful is arraigned for having &#x27;railed on our noble Prince Beelzebub, and spoken contemptibly of his honourable friends, the Lord Old Man, the Lord Carnal Delight, and the Lord Luxurious&#x27;.

This view has been held by most later critics and scholars, in addition to the possibility of earlier editions containing text which was erased in later editions. Several scholars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries also claimed that Wither had offended Lord Chancellor Ellesmere with one of the verses in &quot;Abuses&quot;. This claim, however, was rejected by Pritchard, who blames the misreading of the verses.

Pritchard makes the case that the reason for Wither&#x27;s imprisonment was that he angered Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, by accusing him and others of colluding with the Spanish—and Catholic—government. Pritchard mentions that Northampton was at the height of his power when Wither was arrested, and notes that he was not able to secure his release until after Northampton&#x27;s death in June 1614.

After his release from prison, Wither was admitted, in 1615, to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

In 1621, Wither&#x27;s satirical &quot;Wither&#x27;s Motto: Nec habeo, nec careo, nec curo&quot; (Latin for &quot;I have not, I want not, I care not&quot;) sold over 30,000 copies of this poem were sold, according to his own account within a few months. Like his earlier invective, it was said to be libellous, and Wither was again imprisoned, but shortly afterwards released without formal trial on the plea that the book had been duly licensed.

Ben Jonson turned satire back on Wither, portrayed as the Chronomastix of the masque &quot;Time Vindicated&quot;. Wither avenged himself, by a reference to Jonson&#x27;s drunken conclave. He was obliged to print this book with his own hand, in consequence of his quarrel with the Stationers Company.

===Under Charles I===
Wither was in London during the plague of 1625, and in 1628 published &quot;Britain&#x27;s Remembrancer&quot;, a voluminous poem on the subject, interspersed with denunciations of the wickedness of the times, and prophecies of the disasters about to fall upon England. It reflects on nature of poetry and prophecy, explores the fault lines in politics, and rejects tyranny of the sort the king was denounced for fostering.

In 1635 he was employed by Henry Taunton, a London publisher, to write English verses illustrative of the allegorical plates of Crispijn van de Passe, originally designed for the emblem book by Gabriel Rollenhagen,&quot;Nucleus emblematum selectissimorum&quot; (1610–1613). The book was published as a &quot;Collection of Emblemes, Ancient and Moderne&quot;, of which the only perfect copy known is in the British Museum. In 1636 he translated &quot;The Nature of Man&quot; by Nemesius.

===Civil War soldier===
Wither had served as captain of horse in 1639 in the expedition of Charles I against the Scottish Covenanters, and his religious rather than his political convictions must be accepted as the explanation of the fact that, three years after the Scottish expedition, at the outbreak of the English Civil War, he is found definitely siding with the Parliament. He sold his estate to raise a troop of horse, and was placed by a parliamentary committee in command of Farnham Castle. After a few days occupation he left the place undefended, and marched to London. His own house near Farnham was plundered, and he himself was captured by a troop of Royalist horse, owing his life to the intervention of Sir John Denham, on the ground that so long as Wither lived he himself could not be accounted the worst poet in England.

A reported episode from 1642 or 1643 has Wither with Henry Marten mocking the coronation regalia. At this time, in any case, Wither&#x27;s views were converging with those of the advocates of true popular sovereignty, and his political poem &quot;Vox Pacifica&quot; called for a purge of Parliament.

He was promoted to the rank of major. He was present at the siege of Gloucester (1643) and at Naseby (1645). He had been deprived in 1643 of his nominal command, and of his commission as justice of the peace, in consequence of an attack upon Sir Richard Onslow, who was, he maintained, responsible for the Farnham disaster. In the same year parliament made him a grant of £2000 for the loss of his property, but he apparently never received the full amount, and complained from time to time of his embarrassments and of the slight rewards he received for his services. An order was made to settle a yearly income of £150 on Wither, chargeable on Sir John Denham&#x27;s sequestrated estate, but there is no evidence that he ever received it.

===Commonwealth and Restoration===
He became a political and religious writer using verse as his medium. He is considered to stand out as a supporter of the Commonwealth who also proposed a more egalitarian social vision. His &quot;Respublica Anglicana&quot; (1650) was a reply to the &quot;Anarchia Anglicana&quot; (1649) of Theodorus Verax (Clement Walker), a Presbyterian opponent of the Independents. It defended &#x27;engagement&#x27;, the notion that recognition of the Parliamentary regime should be required.

Wither was a trustee of the Committee for the Sale of the Late King&#x27;s Goods and was paid £100 in March 1650 for his work making inventories of the former royal palaces. A small place given him by the Protector was forfeited after Wither expressed criticism of Cromwell. He was involved in 11 court cases, from 1643 to 1661, including Onslow&#x27;s libel suit over the poem &quot;Justiarius Justificatus&quot;. At the Restoration he was arrested, and remained in prison for three years.

He was a conforming Anglican; but by this time he had moved closer to the Quakers. In &quot;Parallelogrammaton&quot; (1662) he compared to them as predecessors the prophets Ezekiel and Habakkuk.

===Death===
Wither died in London.

==Works==
His extant writings, noted by Thomas Park in Brydges&#x27;s &quot;British Bibliographer&quot;, number over a hundred. Wither wrote, generally, in a pure English idiom, and preferred the reputation of &quot;rusticity&quot;. According to the &quot;Dunciad&quot; &quot;Withers, Ward, and Gildon rest&quot; together &quot;Safe, where no Critics damn, no duns molest&quot;.

===Pastoral and later satires===
He was early known in the pastoral genre. He had figured as one of the interlocutors, Roget, in his friend William Browne&#x27;s &quot;Shepherds Pipe&quot;, with which were bound up eclogues by other poets, among them one by Wither. During his imprisonment he wrote what may be regarded as a continuation of Browne&#x27;s work, &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Hunting&quot; (printed 1615)—eclogues in which the two poets appear as Willie and Roget (in later editions Philarete). It is largely allegorical. The fourth of these eclogues contains a famous passage in praise of poetry; the poets are explicit that pastoral is just a preliminary to other work.

In 1615, the year of his release from prison and admission to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, Wither printed privately &quot;Fidelia&quot;, a love elegy, of which there is a unique copy in the Bodleian Library. Other editions of this book, which contained the lyric &quot;Shall I, wasting in despair&quot;, appeared in 1617 and 1619.

In 1621, he returned to the satiric vein with &quot;Wither&#x27;s Motto: Nec habeo, nec careo, nec curo&quot; (Latin for &quot;I have not, I want not, I care not&quot;). It was said to be libellous, and Wither, for the second time, was imprisoned, but shortly afterwards released.

In 1622 appeared his &quot;Faire-Virtue, The Mistresse of Phil Arete&quot;, a long panegyric of a mistress, partly real, partly allegorical, written chiefly in seven-syllabled verse.

===Psalmody and hymnody===

Wither had begun as a moderate in politics and religion, but his Puritan leanings became more pronounced, as he moved from an Arminian to a more Calvinist position. His later work consists of religious poetry, and of controversial and political tracts. From 1614 he began to work on a new psalm translation, a project in tune with the circle round Sir Edwin Sandys that Wither frequented.

&quot;Preparation to the Psalter&quot; (1619) was an early work in English on literary aspects of the Bible, and initiated a campaign by Wither to substitute his own writings for the dominant psalms.

His &quot;Hymnes and Songs of the Church&quot; (1622–1623) were aimed to counter exclusive psalmody, represented by the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter. Orlando Gibbons provided tunes for some of them. They were issued under a patent of King James I ordaining that they should be bound up with every copy of the authorized metrical psalms offered for sale. This patent was opposed, as inconsistent with their privilege to print the singing-psalms, by the Stationers Company, to Wither&#x27;s great mortification and loss, and a second similar patent was finally disallowed by the House of Lords. Wither defended himself in &quot;The Schollers Purgatory&quot; (1624). In this document, a 140-page diatribe against the Stationers Company for their refusal to print his work, Wither blames them for his financial ruin and hardship.

Some more of Wither&#x27;s religious poetry is contained in &quot;Heleluiah: or Britain&#x27;s Second Remembrancer&quot;, which was printed in Holland in 1641. This work assumed the knowledge of metrical psalms. Besides hymns, the book contains songs, especially the &quot;Cradle Song,&quot; Part 1 No. 50 (&quot;Sleep, baby, sleep, what ails my dear&quot;), the &quot;Anniversary Marriage Song,&quot; Part 2 No. 17 (&quot;Lord, living here are we&quot;), the &quot;Perambulation Song,&quot; Part 2 No. 24 (&quot;Lord, it hath pleased Thee to say&quot;), the &quot;Song for Lovers,&quot; Part 3 No. 20 (&quot;Come, sweet heart, come, let us prove&quot;), the &quot;Song for the Happily Married,&quot; Part 3 No. 21 (&quot;Since they in singing take delight&quot;) and the &quot;Song for a Shepherd,&quot; Part 3 No. 41 (&quot;Renowned men their herds to keep&quot;).

===Context and poetic reputation===
Wither has been classified as a Spenserian, with Michael Drayton, Giles Fletcher, Phineas Fletcher, and Henry More. The early Jacobean Spenserians were generally republican rather than imperial (at least in terms of ancient Rome), of the &quot;country party&quot; rather than the &quot;court party&quot;, nostalgic for Elizabeth I, and in favour of the older ornateness rather than the plain style of James I, however Wither is described by Joan Grundy as adopting a deliberate plainness of style.

According to Christopher Hill:

... we can trace a line from Spenser ... through a group of poets ... ranging from Shakespeare, Drayton, the two Fletchers, William Browne and Samuel Daniel to George Wither.

Or again:

A line of poets could be traced from Sidney and Spenser through Sylvester and Browne to Wither— not, admittedly, of a rising quality, but of a consistent political attitude.

Where Hill identifies connections via the aristocratic patrons and politics, Alastair Fowler takes Drayton to be the poetic centre of a group, which besides Wither comprised Browne, John Davies of Hereford, William Drummond of Hawthornden, George Sandys and Joshua Sylvester.

From c.1640 onwards, Wither assumed an overtly prophetic voice. His wide range of publication, in prose as well as various poetic genres over nearly half a century, has left a very uneven impression of his interests and affected his poetic reputation. George Gilfillan wrote that &quot;Wither was a man of real genius, but seems to have been partially
insane&quot;. Herbert Grierson found something to praise in early love poems, but spoke of &quot;endless diffuse didactic and pious poems, if they can be called poems&quot;.

C. V. Wedgwood wrote &quot;every so often in the barren acres of his verse is a stretch enlivened by real wit and observation, or fired with a sudden intensity of feeling&quot;.

===Later publication===
After a period of neglect, George Ellis anthologised Wither in &quot;Specimens of the Early English Poets&quot; (1790). Samuel Egerton Brydges published &quot;The Shepherds Hunting&quot; (1814), &quot;Fidelia&quot; (1815) and &quot;Fair Virtue&quot; (1818), and a selection appeared in Ezekiel Sanford&#x27;s &quot;Works of the British Poets&quot;, vol. v. (1819).

Most of Wither&#x27;s works were edited in twenty volumes for the Spenser Society (1871–82); a selection was included by Henry Morley in his &quot;Companion Poets&quot; (1891); &quot;Fidelia&quot; and &quot;Fair Virtue&quot; are included in Edward Arber&#x27;s &quot;English Garner&quot; (vol. iv, 1882; vol. vi, 1883), and &quot;The Poetry of George Wither&quot; was edited by Frank Sidgwick in 1902.

A selection of Wither&#x27;s hymns was published in 2011 by The Phoenix Press in The Gibbons Songbook. While primarily a realisation of the tunes Orlando Gibbons wrote for &quot;The Hymns and Songs of the Church&quot;, a selection of verses from the hymns is paired with the original verses from the King James Bible which inspired Wither to create the hymns.

<text>Duncan James Colquhoun Kerr (born 26 February 1952) is a barrister. He is a former judge of the Federal Court of Australia. He also served as President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from 2012 to 2017.

Kerr was previously a politician, as the Labor member for Denison in the Australian House of Representatives, serving between 1987 and 2010. He was Minister for Justice between 1993 and 1996, and in 1993 briefly also Attorney-General of Australia.

==Early life and education==

Born in Hobart, Tasmania, Kerr was educated at the University of Tasmania, where at one stage he was President of the Tasmania University Union. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree, and later with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work.

==Career==

===Politics===

Kerr was the Labor candidate in the Division of Braddon in the 1977 Australian federal election, losing to future Premier of Tasmania Ray Groom. In the Australian federal election in 1987, Kerr defeated the sitting Liberal member, Michael Hodgman QC, for the Hobart-based seat of Denison to become the first Labor member elected from Tasmania since the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in 1975.

Kerr served in the Australian House of Representatives as Member for Denison from 11 July 1987 to 19 July 2010. Prior to entering politics, Kerr acted as Crown Counsel in the Tasmanian Solicitor-General&#x27;s Department, as lecturer in constitutional law and Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Papua New Guinea, and as Principal Solicitor for the Aboriginal Legal Service of New South Wales.

Kerr served as Minister for Justice from 1993 to 1996, and briefly also as Attorney-General in 1993. Prime Minister Paul Keating&#x27;s original choice for Attorney-General in 1993 had been Michael Lavarch, but Lavarch&#x27;s re-election was delayed by the death of an opposing candidate for the seat of Dickson; Kerr held the portfolio in the interim until Lavarch won the resulting supplementary election. Kerr served as Attorney-General for 26 days.

Kerr was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry from 1996 to 2001. He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs in the Rudd Ministry in 2007.

Prior to his appointment to the First Rudd Ministry, Kerr was Co-Convenor of the Australian Parliamentary Group for Drug Law Reform, a cross-party group that advocates harm minimisation as being more effective, more cost-efficient and less harmful than zero-tolerance when it comes to dealing with drug use.

On 14 December 2009, Kerr resigned his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and indicated he intended to return to legal practice. Kerr retired from politics at the 2010 election. Upon Kerr&#x27;s retirement, the previously safe Labor seat of Denison was won by Andrew Wilkie, an independent.

In 2010, Michael Kirby described the decision as &quot;one of the most important in recent years for its affirmation of the centrality in [Australian] constitutional law of the rule of law.&quot;

Kerr has acted as counsel in the High Court of Australia, the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia, the Supreme Court of Tasmania, the District Court of New South Wales, the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea.

On 12 April 2012, he was appointed to the Federal Court of Australia, taking his seat on the bench on 10 May 2012. In 2015, with the consent of the Australian Government, he was appointed by Papua New Guinea as its nominee as an arbitrator in a proceeding in the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Concurrently with his judicial duties, from 2012 to 2017 he served as President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. He was Chair of the Council of Australasian Tribunals (COAT) from 2014 to 2017. He is one of six former federal politicians to have served on the Federal Court, along with Robert Ellicott, Nigel Bowen, Tony Whitlam, Merv Everett and John Reeves.

Kerr ceased to serve as a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia on 25 February 2022 upon reaching the statutory retirement age.

He chairs the National Appeals and Review Panel for Australian Catholic Safeguarding Ltd.

In 2023-2024 he undertook a 20 Year Review of the Office of the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force.

==Honours==

On 23 August 2011, Kerr was conferred with the insignia of Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the Ambassador of France, M. Michel Filhol for defending values dear to France and for his role as Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs in enhancing friendly ties between Australia and France.

<doc id="573392" wikidata="Q5052776" url="?curid=573392" title="Catherine King (politician)">
<text>Catherine Fiona King (born 2 June 1966) is an Australian politician serving as the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government since 2022 and as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Ballarat since 2001. She is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and briefly served as a minister in the Gillard and Rudd governments in 2013. She served as Shadow Minister of Health from 2013 to 2019 and as Shadow Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development from 2019 to 2022.

== Early life ==
King was born in Melbourne on 2 June 1966. She attended primary school in Burwood East and Glen Waverley, before completing her secondary education at Emmaus College.

King completed the degrees of Bachelor of Social Work at the Phillip Institute of Technology and Master of Public Policy at the Australian National University. She later completed a Bachelor of Laws at Deakin University in 2018, and was admitted as a lawyer in Victoria in 2021.

==Working life==
King worked as a social worker at Ballarat Children&#x27;s Homes and Family Services from 1988 to 1992, and in 1991 was named Victorian Young Achiever of the Year in the field of community services. In the same year she spent six months working in Birmingham, England, which influenced her later decision to enter politics. King subsequently joined the Australian Public Service, working as an industry policy officer for the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (1993–1994) and as a senior officer in the Department of Health and Aged Care (1997–1999). She served as assistant director of the department&#x27;s population health division and later as director of injury prevention. While in the public service she lived in Canberra, spending periods in Narrabundah, Hughes and Swinger Hill. King later moved back to Victoria and joined the private sector as a senior manager in KPMG&#x27;s consulting division.

== Politics ==

King joined the Australian Labor Party in 1993 and worked briefly as a research officer for Andrew Theophanous, the parliamentary secretary for health in the Keating government. She served as president of the party&#x27;s Port Melbourne branch from 1998 to 1999.

King is a member of Labor Left.

===Opposition (2001–2007)===
King was the only Labor candidate to win a seat at the 2001 election from the Liberal Party of Australia, and secured a 5.5-point swing, the largest swing to a Labor candidate in the poll. She was likely helped when the Liberals&#x27; initial candidate, Olympic gold medallist Russell Mark, resigned three months before the election, whereas King had 18 months to campaign. She maintained her seat at the 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016 federal elections.

King was re-elected in the 2004 federal election with a slightly reduced majority and was then appointed the Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development. In mid-2005 she was then promoted to Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Treasury.

===Government (2007–2013)===
King was re-elected for a third term at the 2007 federal election, increasing her majority from 2.2 to 8.15 points. In the 2010 federal election she increased her margin to 11.7 points.

King was appointed to serve in the Second Gillard Ministry and was sworn in by Governor-General Quentin Bryce on 14 September 2010 as the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and the Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport. On 25 March 2013, King was appointed to the Ministry as the Minister for Regional Services, Local Communities and Territories and the Minister for Road Safety and sworn in by Governor-General Quentin Bryce. Following the June 2013 Labor leadership spill, she was appointed as the Minister for Regional Australia, Local Government and Territories in the Second Rudd Ministry and promoted into the Australian Cabinet.

===Opposition (2013–2022)===
Despite the defeat of the second Rudd government in the 2013 federal election King retained her seat with a margin of 4.9 points. Following the election of Bill Shorten as Labor Leader, King was appointed to shadow cabinet as Labor Health spokesperson. King was re-elected for a sixth time in the July 2016 federal election, increasing her margin to 7.3 points, and retained her position as Shadow Minister for Health. Following the 2019 election, she was retained in Anthony Albanese&#x27;s shadow ministry and given the portfolio of Shadow Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development.

===Government (2022–)===
Following the 2022 federal election, King was appointed Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government in the Albanese ministry.
